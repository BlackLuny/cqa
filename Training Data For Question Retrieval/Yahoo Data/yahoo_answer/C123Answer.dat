Zgs4RncIaa	Reading Material    http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/teengirls/Pag...|`|hZuq2XT9aa	could be despite all the above..:)|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	I suppose you could be.  You have ever symptom I can think of.  Usally you only have one or two.  You shouldn't be feeling hungry this early and I'm not sure why your back would hurt.  Sore boobs (they should feel a little bigger or sweld), tired, faint & feeling sick are all signs.  Get a home pregnancy test and good luck with that.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	you could be...take a pregnancy test
5ieWhvYCaa	You fail. You fail hard.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	well theyre extra sensitive so it feels weird and if its done hard its just plain going to hurt TMI but have ur hubby/bf/partner gently nib on them and that feel pretty good. lol|`|b2b7e46cf46e9f20f69ec6c16068a6fdaa	I've never heard of this, but as for the stimulation in general, for some people it's good and others it;s just a pain in the, well, nipples!|`|rvVKr3DSaa	It doesnt feel good to me.. i HATE it..  It feels like when u rub something in the same spot.. like a carpet on your nipples... eugh..  It makes me cringe when ithink about it.. i wont let my boyfriend rub my nipples.. he can touch my breasts but nipple stimulation is off limits lol
gx4s68s8aa	as far as the vitamins all you really need is the folic acid (I had this discussion with my high risk doctor lately) and maybe extra iron and calcium.  So if you are getting that in a tablet then any over the counter is fine, until your doctor can recommend a better one.    I am sorry you are going through this.  I don't have that kind of problems since I am high risk.  I go to the doctor (s) all the time.  But go ahead and vent.  A good venting is good for the soul.|`|AA11763588	What branch is your husband in. Are you in the US or Overseas?    If anything comes up abnormal you will get a phone call. Everything else is done by paperwork. So if your pap and blood were normal they will either send you a letter in the mail or just tell you at the next appointment.    More than likely they will do your Ultra Sound at 21 weeks. They may or may not tell you the sex of the baby. I have found that they prefer NOT to tell you and have you go to an off base facility and pay to find out, the reasoning is that determining the sex of your baby is not a medical need.    Good luck!|`|1279d49c535d896b11b907453f4ed733aa	My husband was in the military when I had my first... my best advise: contact a local NON-military doctor off post.  Military insurance won't cover 100% - but the out-of-pocket expense will be well-worth the easing of your own mind.    Best of luck hun & congrats!!|`|DutTBV3caa	my husbands  in the marines so i know exactly how you're feeling. it took 2 days for the naval hospital to confirm my pregnancy and the scheduled me for an appointment over a month later and wouldnt tell me what theyre going to do during the appointment.   military has great insurance but horrible medical care.
apUkTo3maa	I TRIED IT. DIDNT WORK AND NOW WE JUST GAVE UP AND SAID WHEN ITS OUR TIME GOD WILL GIVE US THAT GIFT ONCE AGAIN.... DONT STRESS OVER IT THAT COULD DELAY YOUR PERIOD.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    eVery one is different.    the changes are higher because its around ovulation.  God Bless x wish you all the best|`|AA12016833	Its hard to say. You don't always ovulate around the same day every month. Your best bet is to just have lots of sex. Pregnancy will happen, but if you are thinking about getting pregnant, it usually gets harder to conceive.|`|GalBwrwOaa	you have a very good chance of being pregnant. take a pregnancy test and that will tell you. Good Luck|`|bQk0vpfSaa	there is a possibility, yes. but every woman is different.|`|ae7ehJJyaa	In my opinion, you are very very pregnant -- more pregnant than anyone has ever been in history.
GalBwrwOaa	to tell you the truth that happen with me as well.  Turns out my cervix would not allow me dilate so I never got passed a 4 I was sent home 7 times and it was so frustrating.,  The only way they found out all this is when I went to the hospital and having a lot of contractions and I was over 40 weeks they tried to break my water tried to help my contraction along and I ended up having a c section and that was with my first and with my second I had a schedule c section.  Good luck hope that this will help u
wl7tlYOYaa	its normal before I even found out I was preg my left breast was bigger than my right one...and the breast being sore and swollen looking are actually probably the first very early signs of pregnancy.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	your body is not symmetrical . one eye is not the same as the other your lips are not perfect . if so we would look funny . so every has a breast bigger than the other|`|0TW0zoZUaa	It is absolutely possible!  Just wait they will keep getting bigger!|`|iLHm6iZPaa	Yes it is normal, your breasts are growing and getting ready for you milk to come in.
AA11763588	It takes about 4.5 weeks for a urine test to come back positive and a Quant blood test 2.5 weeks to show a positive.|`|HZubplhvaa	Then why are you so worried?  When are you supposed to have your next period?  If you miss your period, then be concerned.  But otherwise, it's okay.  If it's a big deal, wait another week.|`|imygOatJaa	you can take one any time you want.|`|oAyI70W5aa	some tests work like 5 days before missing period.  that pink one.. its called like first something.      answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|vGHExDOzaa	5 days before period|`|8ELfnTODaa	you can test about 5 days before your missed period with the more sensitive pregnancy tests.|`|AA11523164	i think it is one week after your first missed period :) good luck|`|RQmj6NEOaa	now|`|ixC62Zhxaa	Relax Juno...|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	12 DPO. So, 5 days from now.|`|RC2aQBkgaa	after your first missed period|`|qN5iVvAFaa	the nuva ring works... i was on it for years.... you should be fine!!!|`|nRuEaqm5aa	well u shudnt have had sex in the first place , y are u sucha  dumbass , use a condom unless u come from the ***** neighborhood and cnt afford it or they cought u jakin it|`|AA10318076	Usually if you're period is late that is when you should take it.  My wife was a day late and took it and it came back positive.  I didn't *** inside either, but she is pregnant now.  Pre-*** will get you pregnant if you're not careful.  Also it's our 3rd kid so it gets easier ever time I guess.|`|iZPWWLqVaa	You can take some early detection pregnancy tests from one week/10 days, although they arent as accurate as the ones from 2 weeks onwards...|`|JLoDcuUpaa	Ok I have done this a lot, well it depends on the test you take some say 10 days after some say week before period.  I like Clear Blue..
QmTCMZtgaa	I was able to keep up my supply for 2 1/2 months after my baby stopped nursing through pumping exclusively.      You would have to maintain a schedule of pumping 8-10 times a day (if your baby won't nurse).  A hospital grade pump would have been ideal, but I used a Medela PIS.|`|FNjUT8n4aa	yes! i did it, but i noticed that if i let her just suck on me instead of her pacifier instead of using the pump as stimulation then the milk came back faster and in bigger amounts. i would let her just suck every 3-4 hours for 2 days straight and 3 days later i woke up engorged! so shes back to breast feeding now thankfully.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	yes, maybe.  try it out! (you'll really have to go hard at it though)    i know a woman who adopted two kids and was determined to breast feed them both.  so she pumped like crazy and ended up being able to do it!  i never would have thought such a thing could happen :)|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	yes ma'am. just put that baby to the breast, when I had to relactate I didnt pump I just put baby on the breast, it took a few days of baby being latched but we got through it.|`|JXHy2EHQaa	Yes.  Pump every two hours.  Once nothing comes out, keep pumping for a few more minutes to encourage your body to make more.  Drink lots of water, eat oatmeal, beer, and flaxseed oil, and avoid mint, sage and cold remedies.  You can also try latching her on again.  What did the LC say about her latch problems?  Some babies can take months to get their latch figured out.  Once you've started pumping, you can use a supplemental nursing system and go back to breastfeeding.  If you need more help with your supply, there is the herbal route....9 capsules of fenugreek and 9 capsules of blessed thistle per day.  It's awesome that you want to give your daughter what she was born to have!
om09b9UNaa	Totally normal, I know you are excited though. but yes this is normal, and who knows, sometimes you can tell the sex of the baby this early, it depends, drink lots of juice and the baby will be active so maybe you will get a 2 in 1 kin of deal. Good luck.|`|ioZeveazaa	I didn't get my anatomy ultrasound till 19 weeks and I wish I had waited just a couple weeks later because she was still quite small and details weren't very clear. You can tell anatomy as early as 15 weeks depending on how skilled your tech is but I would advise waiting till atleast 20 weeks. Good luck!!|`|4AO2myzKaa	Well, congrats, at this point there is a very low chance of miscarriage.  They were probably trying to save you $$.  I had my first ultrasound at 8 weeks, and then one at 20 weeks (where we found out the gender, etc).  I also did one at 27 weeks because I thought he wasn't kicking enough, but he was just taking a long nap and was okay.  My other friend, though, had an insurance problem as well and is getting her first ultrasound in a few weeks and she's about as far along as you are.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I had one at 7 weeks, bc I had a previous miscarriage so my midwife wanted to take an ultrasound to make sure things were progressing normally and then I had one at around 20 weeks which is where I found the sex of the baby, I am 34 weeks now and I havent had anymore.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Normal pregnancy, you will have one at 20 weeks.|`|QSodlfMraa	12 17 and 19 weeks|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I had my first at 20 weeks, My OB said that they usually (for a normal pregnancy) they would only do one at 20 weeks. Our baby is a stinker and would not cooperate and I got another one at 24 weeks. If you only get one at 20 weeks its normal. Too many U/S can be harmful for that baby.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I didn't get mine until 20 weeks. That's usually when most people have one.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	i had my first at 9w0d and that`s cause i didnt know my LMP but most doctors dont do the first till around 20 weeks|`|6avKnzkoaa	I got an ultrasound (drinking water and all) at 13 weeks for a Nuchal Scan - checks for down syndrome, the probability of stillbirth, etc.     However, at my OB's office he had a simple ultrasound machine that just checked the baby. (No need for water or anything.)    Had another one at 18 weeks - fetal morphology, check genders etc.|`|o2ehEqinaa	I had one at 7 1/2 weeks, 12 weeks, 19 weeks, 23 weeks and 3D/4D @ 17 weeks.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I had one at 8 weeks because I went to the ER because I was bleeding. Then I had one at 10 weeks at my first doctor appointment because I told them I had gone to the ER. Then I had another one at 12 weeks because in the 10 week one the placenta was covering my cervix and they wanted a different doctor to look at it. And Friday at 18 weeks I'll be having my anatomy ultrasound : )|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Usually the first ultrasound is done at 19-20weeks   (unless there is need for an early one - threatened miscarriage or history or miscarriage etc)  I had my first at 8weeks (to see how many babies i was carrying). I have had complications and have now had 6ultrasounds in total|`|53QQ9KXEaa	My first appointment was when I was at 13 weeks and I had my first ultrasound when I was 15w6d but I found out that I was exactly 17 weeks.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Usually an ultrasound is done around 18-22 weeks. I am 15 weeks and have one scheduled in 3 weeks. A lot of times Dr's will perform one before 18-22 if they have a concern or think the dates are off.
AA11920812	Men.     First you have to learn to speak man. That means when they say you don`t consider what they want - they want more. He just doesn`t want a no he wants to talk about it and work it out. He wants to plan on June. So, be specific in your timing. Also, be specific about your plans, hopes, ideals for a new baby and expanding your family.    Pat his back. Tell him you are proud of what a good father husband he is. And, know that once your daughter is a little older it will be easier for you to mentally (emotionally) be available to an infant. Explain how YOU feel being at home with an infant (guys don`t experience this!!). And, how you feel that will clash with your daughter now at this point in her development.    Give him reassurance that this isn`t HIS fault. Or HE did something wrong. That that burden off him. He`ll be fine and come around.    My husband did the same thing. Although he didn`t pressure me so hard - as we had just had a baby. Gosh, the man loves babies! :))) I bet yours is just as good of a daddy as mine is :))    (((HUGS)))  and good luck with your talk!|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	sounds like something else is going on with him that he doesnt want to talk to you about and hes taking it out on you. if it is the having another baby thing, calmly explain to him that you are the one whos going to have to be pregnant while taking care of your daughter at the same time and its not easy so why not wait till you're ready? it will be easier on everyone. good luck|`|kDv1uC1raa	Ask him why he wants to have another so soon? Maybe there is a good reason and thats why he is upset... its sound like he wants a comprise or for you to listen to him atleast. Then try telling him why you need to wait a little longer...|`|THZEgP3waa	it seems like hes saying that he really wants to have another baby and he doesnt see why you guys cant.  hes probably feeling impatient and frustrated.|`|I08pH9Byaa	It sounds like he really wants another baby.  He is just attacking your character instead of the issue.  We all are guilty of that at one point or another in our marriages.  It is a stupid way to fight, but we all do it.  Try to focus on finding a solution to the problem.  You may as well start trying, you sound like you want to have another, you just want it on your terms.    You could call your OB and make an appointment.  Let him know that you have done this, and after that appointment, and after you begin your prenatals, you will be very glad to give him another son/daughter.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Sounds to me as if nothing you do is right in your husband's eyes. He can fall asleep after sex and you are not supposed to? You should stay up with him and watch the super bowl, even if you do not want to? He sounds very controlling, angry when you go off and see friends. Be careful and try to stay as independent of his control as possible. He does not own you.|`|e56e3ec80b6d752cf7c22bb5200608b0aa	If your not ready take birth control let him have his fun so this way your not completely telling him no ?
WPI0Z47saa	I was told that it isn't a good idea and to use tylenol for back aches.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i would just stick to tylenol if i were you =] good luck|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Im sure its fine. If it doesnt say not to use if pregnant on the package.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	My Ob said it was safe after the first trimester.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	yep!  we moved across country when I was 2 1/2 months pregnant...not a fun trip...I was told as long as I don't go super crazy with it I was ok.  I mainly used it for my back and knees and never had any problems.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	i used ice hot while i was pregnant i had alot of lower back problems but just call your doctor or a doctors office and see what they say.  however your are just putting on your skin not the baby so its will not penetrate your skin to effect your internal organs so therefore will not effect the baby. but like i said call your doc. if you don't feel right using it|`|kT7GVOosaa	I was told to only use the cream like once a month if that. all cream gets into your blood stream. as for the patch I am not positive but I would think no because you are not supposed to do anything that will change your body temperature. no hot tubs or even hot baths. I would avoid it. I take Tylenol and have my husband give me a back rub.|`|vTPA5PXnaa	Yes it is perfectly ok to use icy hot while pregnant. when i was pregnant with my twins i would get these really sharp stretching pains right below my breast. My doctor told me that it was just my ligaments stretching and pulling trying to make room for my growing uterus. Trust me i really freaked out too, lol. But yea it is ok.
pwu9xzF8aa	it happens with some women! sometimes its just the normal process of your own body. with me, it was a clot left over that didnt come away with all the other yucky bits.   Go and see your GP again just to be on the safe side.  But unless you are having fevers and feeling unwell, it shouldnt be any retained products (just letting u know my experiance)  it could be your body's own response to child birth- and when u think about it, it was only 8 weeks ago that a human passed through you lol- your body might need a bit of extra time to heal! congrat's on your little one|`|9kPPmazoaa	Does your doctors office have a number you can call to ask questions? Like a "advise nurse" I would call them and ask. Its kind of hard to say... I experienced the same thing... I stopped bleeding around 5 weeks PP and started again around 6 weeks PP (what I "thought" was my period). I am not sure if it was actually my period  or whether it was just a second round of bleeding. The only difference is I am not spotting like you are ( I actually "think" I am ovulating, or just finished ovulating right now-don't know for sure). If I were you I would call the doctor and ask them to be sure.     Its always possible the bleeding around 6 weeks PP was just a second round of bleeding... and this spotting is your period. But its hard to say. Sometimes it takes a while for everything to get "back to normal".
1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	tired, feeling sick, sore boobs, headaches, tummy cramps, metallic taste in your mouth, all lovely stuff but well worth it in the end heheh  good luck and congrats|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	tiredness, odd feeling like not quite yourself, vomiting, wanting to pee alot, slight aching in abdomen, vivid dreams, ability to only eat ceareal!|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Missed period  nausea  metallic taste in mouth  exhaustion  food cravings  frequent urination  sensitive nipples    ...and this is just what I'm dealing with|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I didn't have any besides a missed period at that point.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	5 weeks sore breast about 6 weeks my morning sickness hit me.|`|50lIaC8zaa	With both my pregnancies apart from the missed period by about 6 weeks i had started feeling sick, was peeing more and had sore boobs.|`|d8fSVX23aa	sicky burps and tiredness.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Vomitting, nausea, headaches, breast tenderness, metalic taste in mouth, increased urination, constipation, food cravings or aversions, thirst, increased vaginal discharge, fatigue, missed period, fainting, dizzy spells...  Any combination or none of the above is considered 'normal'!  ADD - oh, backache too like someone else said. And mood swings.|`|BIC5BlAHaa	im also 5/6 weeks and i have morning sickness, sore breast, and lower back pain|`|ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	Please note I'm using my husbands name has mine keeps signing out. ayli1984    You may feel sick or maybe be sick however it has been known some women's morning (or in my case ALL DAY) sickness only starts once pregnancy has been confirmed (don't ask why cause I really don't know) but other than that nothing but a missed period.
ROJans2Taa	I got real dizzy around 12 weeks it lasted pretty much to the end, but eased a little around 21 weeks, I got bad leg cramps around 18 weeks on, my vagina was swollen from around 23 weeks on. I also bled and had cramps from 5-11 weeks. I did feel a weird tightening sensation in my vagina right before I found out I was pregnant which was 4 weeks, it lasted till around 9 weeks, it would sort of tighten on it's own (odd I know,lol)|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	cramping in my left butt cheek.... Nah I'm not joking I really do get that....  But baby's first kick is the weirdest one of all.... Got it for the first time nearly 2 weeks ago and it was amazing and very hard to describe.  Now I'm getting used to it but it's still weird! xx
FoY5fgVwaa	My suggestion would be to go to a high-risk ob and let him know how your last pregnancies were. He will do everything in his power to keep the baby in there as long as possible and be sure to keep an extra close eye on you!!  Hope this helps, good luck with your third pregnancy.  I just found out I was pregnant with my third, too!
52bAHCaUaa	Well, you should probably know whether or not your baby has been claimed...     You could call the IRS and more than likely they will be able to tell you.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Call IRS. or go to a tax preparer.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	please add some details that makes no sense.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I would call the IRS and ask.|`|xcPghcw9aa	well who else wants to claim your baby? you are the parent.|`|W1wDHUYoaa	I'm just going to tell you this as "nicely" as I possibly can. If the child does not live with you, DO NOT  claim it. I don't care if you are the father. My cousin who has full custody of her son has her ex calling her and saying I'm going to claim our son not you. Blah blah blah why should you get the tax return money and not me. Well here is why in case you are confused.   1. She has custody  2. The tax money goes towards the BABY not the parent.  3. Legally it goes to who it lives with.  4. Don't be a selfish bastard, if you cared you'd pay child support. (ok that was harsh but it's true)    Anyways another good reason not to claim it if it doesn't live with you EVEN if you have joint custody is 99.9% of the time the other party will claim it and if you claim it as well you will get audited and have to pay it all back.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	huh?
ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	Please note I'm using my husbands name has mine keeps signing out.    1st DAISYHILL, LYNNE - NOT A SUPERMUM!, & ANYONE ELSE WHO IS TRYING 2 SAY KATY IS A PERV 4 SAYIN SPANKIN I THINK UR F*CK*D IN HEAD N NEED 2 GROW UP U SICK PIECES OF SH*T.    2nd If your sister did not mean to drop the glass then your parents have WAY over stepped the mark with this one. I believe some kids do need a smack and STRONGLY believe that if some got one there would be far less anti social behavior. However if your sister ment to smash the glass out of madness or whatever (I'm not saying she did) then yes she should be punished but even then I think 10 is a little old for smacking maybe she could have been sent to her room and something she really enjoys taken away.     ayli1984|`|8UEvryP3aa	I think you should speak to your mum and dad about this, because they have gone a little to far on this one.   When you speak to your mum and dad, make sure your little sister isnt around.. shes probs already upset enough as it.  You have to be mature when you speak to your mum and dad because they might take it the wrong way.. but on the other hand they could take it the right way and understand where your coming from.   The reason im saying make sure your little sister isnt around when you speak to them is incase your parents take it the wrong way and she sees you aruging she might begin to think its all her fault when this all started out as an accident.    I hope ive helped in some kind of way.  Paige.|`|QTJhbDE3aa	Yeah that sounds a little extreme, and I am pro-spanker.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	I fit was an accident then definately not! if she was throwing a tantrum and threw it I'd probably give her a little swat.|`|5O7op0oIaa	Don't know. I've always firmly believed in smacking, having had more than a couple myself to straighten out my errant ways.    However, my daughter is now one year old, and I can't see how I could possibly lay a hand on her. I still think it's the right thing to do, in certain circumstances, I just don't think I can bring myself to do it.    :/|`|zG1m1eXxaa	If it was an accident (which it probably was) then spanking her would be harsh as we all make mistakes in life because we're human but if she did it in anger (which I doubt she did) then yes she deserved it.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	That's inappropriate.  In order for spanking to be effective, you need to treat it like the nuclear bomb of punishment that it is.  Safe it for things truly important like direct defiance and dangerous behavior.  Dropping a glass is not willfull.  Having her clean it up woud have been fitting.    "Smacking" is the Brit term for spanking.  Here in Texas we call it a whooping!|`|2F5HNPqPaa	If it was an accident then I don't think she needs any discipline!  If she was throwing the glass or being silly with it then maybe...    But I don't think spanking is really the way... the most hitting really should be slap on a little hand before it touches the hob!!!  If parents don't want their kids to be violent then it makes no sense to be violent towards them.  Your parents sound... silly.|`|cddc817b6caa7c36ce295665e32c6254aa	this is totally out of order, please tell me your details and i will happily send onto child abuse, TELL YOUR PARENTS THIS IS NOT RIGHT, children can be corrected but not by violence and shame, hope to hear from you soon , worried parent|`|3qLIRorjaa	Your parents aren't strict, they're evil.|`|in6nku0Kaa	a bit excessive in my opinion|`|wWBkIkTNaa	For breaking a glass, yes thats too harsh. Its not like she did it on purpose.|`|wUAUKlKkaa	I think it is quite harsh - the threat was enough from my mam and dad to make me behave|`|cEXzXkqnaa	Yes...that is a little extreme...i am sure dropping the glass was an accident...adn 10yrs is too old to be spanked|`|AA10953561	It depends, did she just drop the glass by accident or was she acting out and drop/toss/throw it as an act of rebellion? At ten years old your sister is getting a little old for spankings.    Generally the only time I spank is if the child is continuously defiant of me or if they are doing something that could harm themselves or the people around them. I reserve spanking for extreme cases, that way it stays effective.|`|KFagjt8Jaa	Personally, I believe that smacking as a controlled form of discipline is fine, if that's what you want to do. Smacking as an angry, loss-of-control knee-jerk reaction is wrong, and it's a form of bullying.|`|zHRWklEWaa	I'm guessing she did this unintentionally? I think that is a little over the top, having her clean up the glass and maybe pay for a replacment would have been plenty.|`|yQAqtNifaa	Wow, yea that is way overboard.  Accidents happen! jeeeeez|`|gEz5ICgLaa	thats stupid,why would you hit for a glass!|`|BhXOLas1aa	I am beyond outrage, if I could show your parents how to care for the most precious thing in life, their child I would teach them the difference in setting boundaries with loving concern and not brutality.  You need to speak to  help line but all I know is child-line uk.  Please please don't let this happen to her, it is abuse.  Do you have another close relative that you can talk to?  Let me know where you live and I will do everything to help you find someone who is qualified to help|`|onIwB8lnaa	I'd Definitely Smack a child if they didn't listen after all my great great grand-dad made me take it up the bum.
b442f47acfb237841f00f3f333625749aa	Nothing is wrong with that|`|17a395fec900b43169498e5b73b61aceaa	No, and possibly.  Recent research has shown that sex close to the end of the 3rd trimester can actually help induce labor.  I believe to a woman who has been carrying for 9 months, the sooner labor start, the better.    So as long as you and your mate are into it, there's very little bad about having some some fun while she's pregnant.|`|AA12399160	Neither. But it can make being pregnant much more fun.|`|1b030f80d91eada74b6dd27de1e8f2a9aa	Only time it might be a problem is with a high-risk pregnancy. In normal circumstances, enjoy yourselves before the baby gets there... not much time, or energy, after delivery.     Sex is well known to help labor begin. Both from orgasms in the women helping to start the contractions, and the sperm to help soften the cervix.
AA12384088	I always slept on my ride side while pregnant. No problems.  I was on my back while watching TV in bed and would switch sides every once in a while.    You flip constantly from side to side anway.|`|AA10405966	I bought a body pillow and slept mostly on my right-side.  I found that I was most comfortable when I could 'hug' the pillow and wrap my legs around it; this seemed to relieve some pressure on my lower back.|`|072b0eb01dfcd307d99c862629a743c4aa	Yes, sleep on whatever side makes you feel comfortable.  When you are pregnant, you need to be able to get as much rest as possible...Once you have your child, you will not be able to do this.  Good luck|`|7e38971602aa7920055efbe2403d7d32aa	I am 15 weeks with my third baby, and I sleep mostly on my right side. However, I can never seem to stay comfortable, so I toss and turn a lot.  Most people will say don't sleep on your back. It isn't good and can put pressure on some nerves and such. But if you wake up on your back don't worry. You can tell that you have been laying on your back too long if you wake up light headed, if that happens, just change positions.   I also sleep on my stomach when I'm not pregnant, just sleep however you are more comfortable.  Congratulations, and good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!|`|1fe7548a38e463d0ef61dedc26dcf9c4aa	Wherever I'm comfortable.  Honestly, I don't think it matters.|`|180dc2ead2ed27e0ff5172f56ef539d5aa	I am also a stomach sleeper and have had two kids and tried the whole left side thing! I would also end up on my back or the other way, its just impossible to sleep on one side all night. I have a 3 year old and a 6 month old and they are both fine. I would worry about it too much! You dont have to much longer now. Good luck|`|AA11944878	i sleep some left some right|`|9bf093f1b27615e45f1e617554b40f44aa	I CANT sleep on my back. My unborn son, Dante, will lay on my artery and screw with my blood pressure. I can't even get any dental work done without getting really lightheaded and nauseous.

My friends and i have done that with our boyfriends and have come up with very creative ideas....    example: Janet and Luis = Janis......Jan {from JANet} is {from luIS}|`|fd5e79e0ebda469842a9dff30e975c0eaa	Tristin?

But if there is a father in the picture then it's going to be harder.  call dept of family services they can tell you more.  you can how ever give your child to your sister right from birth.|`|AA12340272	hahaha
b0fe847af27a18bcd4c485c6fc03d981aa	If it's not too far away, you could just go to the restaurant and speak to the manager in person.  This would solve the problem of not being able to get through on the telephone, plus the manager may be more sympathetic if you're speaking to them face to face.    If you do this, try to go in the morning, as that seems to be when most retail managers are available.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Ask the central one for the local number and then ask for the manager.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Go in there and ask for the Mgr.
K5AeQuSNaa	lol.  You get used to it fairly quickly, but every now and then you find something in there to surprise you.  I have worked with kids for almost 20 years, and I still occasionally open up a diaper an wonder what the heck the parents were feeding that child.  When the smell is enough to singe your eyebrows, all you can do is hold your breath, and try not to think of what made it that slightly radioactive green color.  The faster you finish up, the sooner you can run out of the room gagging and retching.  Good luck, and don't worry, you'll get used to it soon.  Or you will burn out all of the sensitive parts of your nose, which is roughly the same thing...|`|VHHis05Naa	Within a day or two.  It's not pleasant, but it needs to be done.  I don't think your parents should make you change their diapers.  I think there are plenty of other things you could do to help out.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	Not long, because it is better to get them changed (and get rid of the smell, etc) than leave them in the soiled diaper.  I swear my daughter leaves a visible stink trail if she walks around for more than 30 seconds with a poopy diaper- so I change it and the world is right again.  Good for you for helping- that's awesome!|`|SrcoG7JRaa	I had practice with my two godsons (now 4 yrs and 22 months), and with them, it took me a few changes to get used to it. It probably would have bothered me more if I didn't work around horses, but mucking stalls for years kind of desensitizes you to poo.    My husband didn't even flinch the first time, he's a surgeon, so he's seen it all and says stinky diapers don't even register as gross, LOL.|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	i never had a problem but my hubby was different lol it took him 4 months before he would even change just a wet one lol  at you age i think i would have been the same.
AA11763588	It's best to wait 5 days after you miss your period. You have to let the hormones build up in your system.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The earliest a test will show positive is 10 days after conception.  It is best to wait 19 days though for the most accurate result.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Wait until you miss your period.|`|SGeo7cqYaa	3 to 4 weeks|`|NwVBautHaa	17-21 days
UahvH8Kmaa	Children pick up a second language so fast.  A lot of people speak nothing but spanish in there homes until there children go to school at age five and then the children generally pick up english in a matter of a couple of weeks just listening to it and being around it all the time.  I would not worry about that it is very easy to learn a second language up until a certain age and the younger they start the easier it is.  Also, as for the childcare situation.  I would look into either a home daycare or a childcare center that has a "sick" room so that you can still bring your child to daycare when he is sick or else find out if your job allows a number of personal days or sick days.  Children do not get sick as often as you would think honestly.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	I am a mother of three small children, adn my husband and I were separated for 5 months. I had to work and care for them. My 4 year old daughter ask me the other day why I worked so much. So that is what I am asking you what is more important- your child being with you or the money that you are making? As far as learning of English, they're programs that are available to help children learn English, as well as the noggin channel on television that is a wonderful thing to help children learn all sorts of things from colors, shapes, healthy eating habits, and every day living necessities. So please consider the information that I have shared for you- the child did not ask to be born, do what is best for it and be a good mother. I apologize if I upset you.|`|hyN684hxaa	Its the easiest time for a human to learn a language as a baby, 2 1/2 isn't that bad but it will feel like a second language instead of simply being bilingual, it will take a bit to get him to learn it, its a little late but its still a very absorbent period for his mind
zbjaBgyEaa	That's weird.  I think Ennis was also the name of Bill Cosby's SON.  I'd think, because of the similarities to Dennis and Inis that it would be masculine as well.  Good catch, I suppose.  I wouldn't have noticed, to be honest.|`|VHHis05Naa	I don't really consider BNW to be a reliable site.  Have you checked Behindthename?    I tihnk it's definitely and solidly MALE.  I don't see anything even remotely feminine about it.|`|Elxuvon8aa	to me it is male but it could be  E Nes a female|`|GAj9hwWvaa	Yes, it sounds masculine unless the 'I' is pronounced as a 'Y" if that is the case it would be more fem. like Ynes.??? Regardless the name isn't that great anyway.|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I have never seen those spellings but it is both a male and female name. I don't like it either way..|`|5DK546BUaa	behindthename.com has it listed as 'feminine & masculine'  and shows popularity only for the masculine side... which usually means that the feminine side is so rare as to have no ratings...|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Nowadays so many people are making "unisex" names out of traditional masculine and feminine ones it doesn't really matter anyways.|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	hahahahahaha...... my last name is Inness (rhymes with Guinness)    I'm not sure if people would use this name as a boy or a girl because I think of it only as a last name... I guess more of a boy's name? Only because it's kind of like what you said- like the name Ennis (ee-niss) from Broke Back Mountain. That's so weird to me though... who knew my last name was a unique baby name? =]
fZjHAxwHaa	You have to tewll her one way or another running away is theworst thing you could do because your putting your self ands the babies in danger. jsut sit down and talk about it it wont be as bad as you think, it will be hard at first, but youll be glad you tell her sonner than later.

There is no easy way but to just come out with the truth. :) Good luck!|`|sxqUt49xaa	You have to tell her. Just come straight out and say it. It's hard yes.

AA10230627	It could just be your gag reflex. About the morning sickness your doc can provide you with a pill that eases the morning sickness and allows you to eat normally. So talk to your doc and explain what's going on.|`|AA11920812	Is it the food that is making you sick. Like, your eating when this happens? I had that with my first pregnancy, but this one that isn't so bad.  Sometimes I feel like my stomache is at my throat...I think it's just the morning sickness. My OBGYN said it was normal.    If you feel like your choking that's a different story.    But, if you have heartburn you would feel pain in the chest and be gassy. If you have either of those or both it's problem heartburn. Tums, yoghurt, and milk are good home remedies for heart burn. Try sleeping propped up and don't lie down it makes it worse.     Hope this helps!|`|642b31354742e7fa33dcb587b70e5c1daa	see a doc, if you have been vomiting alot it could be your throat is scared from the acid...  go see your doc!|`|AA11344652	it could be your pipes closing you should see a doctor right away|`|098adb46f0897a865132593a1944bcb5aa	that sound like heart burns but i'm not for sure.

Most women do not show until they are about 3 months pregnant and even then it still does not look like the typical pregnant belly.   If you are having belly issues at 3 weeks, it is probably weight that you had on before you got pregnant!!

Good Luck!|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	Honestly I would call your OB/GYN, and schedule an appointment.. IT doesn't necessarily mean you are pregnant. The bleeding can mean many things. You can be pregnant and still get your period. I have 2 kids and had my period for almost 3 months. Have you switched birth controls if you are on them?

AA12358900	If you're anything like me it's because you somehow expect them to know how to act by osmosis lol. I have learned that the secret to not becoming a crazy person as a parent is choices. I give my children choices every time we go out. If we go to the grocery store they have the choice of behaving and picking out an item either for themselves or for the family that I normally wouldn't buy, or misbehaving and not getting the item, or if the misbehaviour is bad enough of going home. This should work for 5 and 3 year olds, depending on their mental and emotional maturity and your normal parenting style. In restaurants I use behave or we leave now and when we get home I will cook the meal. Then I would intentionally make the meal bad, either something they didn't like or conveniently overcooking it (oops I don't know how that happened). My children soon learned that didn't pay off. At the same time I use a mix of games to keep them from becoming bored. At 5 and possibly 3 they can probably recognize letters and numbers and you can see how many you can see on a shelf. I also had them help me locate items on the shelves as they sort by brand near me not item (carrots are in 4 different places for one size - total pain) We also did color games, and mixed in lessons on social behaviour and any other thing we happened to see. It can be alot of talking, but worth it for less frustration in my opinion. For restaurants and places they will need to sit, I like washable crayons and paper or coloring books. Then you can tell stories, play games like tic tac toe, draw funny faces. You have to be creative, kids like fun.  Also, I know you've seen this a million times, but try to avoid shopping at nap times. Tired children are a nightmare in stores and there's nothing for it but to either leave immediately, or if that is not possible, rush lol. If they simply refuse to stay at your side you have no choice but to inform them of the existence of child snatching strangers. Don't present it in a scary way. I just told mine that there are people out there that take children from their parents. I don't want to lose you so please stay with me. Of course they ask who the people are and you may have some embarrassing moments when they point at people and ask if that person or that person could take them. Good natured people will understand the need to teach them this and may even answer the child. When mine asked what the people do with the kids I told them I don't know(coward prob, but i think they are too young to know specifics).  Good Luck|`|43a6c1ca7d0932082d3089a80bbe28faaa	I know EXACTLY what you are going through. Putting a leash on them isn't going to get you in any trouble, but will probably result in a lot of resistance from the girls. You probably don't want to be seen dragging them (literally) around the mall either. Just make things clear before you go someplace that you want them to behave a certain way. Let them know the consequences if they don't do as they are told. Say you tell them you will leave the store if they misbehave, and they start running all over. Do what you tolf them you would do. even if you leave a full cart of groceries int he middle of the isle. They'll get the idea after a while. And if the behave, praise is a great motivator. A little treat wouldn't hurt either, but not all the time or they'll expect rewards for normal behavior. Good luck!|`|544b0876bc967124cb745a38cec8da98aa	a leash is not a bad thing is people ask say it is so taht no one will take them you can't get in trouble for that. also take away toys and stuff like that|`|3b4aee778c641761c667e4939d750c02aa	Whenever they begin misbehaving grab them by the arm somewhat tight and staring directly to thier eyes and say No More...DO YOU UNDERSTAND? And they will look at you several times trying to see if you were playing or being serious about. Make sure that every time you return the look at them is very sharp straight forward and meaningfull. If that doesn't work, when you spank them only one time but enough like to create pain and not  hate towards you.|`|3b226af976686dcca1eeab94ac2c27caaa	Well you can treat them without having to do all the things you have named of doing. Well you need to train them pets and children are kind of the same. You have to train a pet like you train children. You have to treat them nicley when you do these things and you are responsible for them. Well both of your girls run around and they dont listen im guessing. Well if there 5 and 6 then you teach themby putting them in time outs and when they want deserts after dinner do not gice them any until the learn. If they are 7 and 8 then i sugest simply sitting down with each one individually and talking to them why do you do what you do first they will explain. If they dont have them think about it for a minute or so and then ask again. Hopefully they will tell you why and you can explain to them why its wrong. Then if they still do it you have to show them who is boss you say we had talked about this know since i told you this and we went over it you have to learn not to do it. so put them in time out. Or no tv for a week. Or no friends over. Little and simple things like that but you have to learn to disapline your children and do not be afraid do it when they get home talk about it then disapline them. If they dont understand it then i say get help. Most likly though you have to learn that parents have ti be parents simetimes and learn to let there children cry for awhile and when there ready to tell you there sorry and they explain what they did wrong then they will be able to go in a store without screaming and running around. But if none of this works i suggest telling them why you dont want them running around bc you dont want someone to steal them bc they mean so much to you. But dont scare them thats only if they really dont listen.|`|8a0efe75d1f9b650d03633a29c2f2039aa	have you thought of maybe a babysitter? they are cheeper than "nannys"  and i am one myself , send me an email if you need a babysitter and tell me about where you live (which state that is!!)   motherhens124@yahoo.com|`|cfc1a65655691b46e2ceb0cfc1039dd2aa	you should spank your kids where and when you see fit.. its good parenting to be a good parent, not try to fit in with people at the mall.. thats the problem with alot of people.. to fake.. get real with it.. this aint oprah, fellas.. im not saying beat your kids but, i am saying DONT get a leash.. remember, REAL WITH IT.. come on.. and with two baby girls that young, you should keep your frickin eyes on them and not let a 'weirdo' get the chance.. there are alot of good people out there to though that dont mind if you spank your kids when they need it and dont want to run off with your babies, even ones with poopy names and looks and such..|`|aff24c8c1e29ed8627848e8cde47c4b4aa	You may not be able to afford a nanny but you need to get the kids under control because they know that they can control. you. Give them time outs and stick to it don't let up with disciplining them. I know first hand that this is hard but it works. You can also make a rewards chart if they behave they can get candy or little trinket or time alone with you.If you find yourself still losing control maybe you have the anger illness. Check out Dr. Keith Abalo show it is good and he gives suggestions on how to handle this. good luck.|`|f8836b6a1846f40184de99bd27fe4a40aa	Your children are misbehaved because you have not set clear ground rules when out.  They obviously are happy to be out and "free" in public.  However, you need to set the ground rules, that it is not allowed unless you state so.  If you go out and have not said it is ok for them to run and play, the second that they do, grab them by the arm and march them extremely quickly out to the car and go home.  You will only have to do this a couple of times until they will listen to you and not do it.  Never be afraid to grab your kids by the arm pit and walk/pull them out from where you are.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	I HAVE THAT SAME PROBLEMS!! MY GIRLS ARE 5&4. They are unruly and wild! They act up for me, but nobody else! I know EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL!!! Sometimes I feel so helpless, and unlike you I had a trip to the looney bin! The child leashes do not work... By now your girls now how to unleash themselves...Mine did! The whole throwing a fit will not work either... I tried that and my kids laughed at me and told me I was Crazy! Honestly.... This is all a phase and they are testing you. Eventually they will get over it. Maybe if the father is involved in their lives..He should up his voice and assert himself. If not then Try upping your voice, or stare into their eyes with a firm tone and tell them that they need t ostraighten out or else they will get a spanking. If need be take them to a bathroom and swat their hands. These days they are quick to jump on a parent for everything, but that's when I turn around and ask them How their parents raised them? Ten to One they got the good old fashion @$$ whooping!     GOOD LUCK AND HOPEFULLY THIS MAKES YOU A BIT SETTLED THAT YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONE GOING THROUGH IT!

5f57db896eea23b1cc3a92d54fc4e0ceaa	There are no false positives. The hcg hormone that the test detects is ONLY present when pregnant. Your doctor can advise you about the bleeding. Some women still spot/bleed lightly when they would normally get their period and go on to have normal healthy babies.   Congrats!|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	I would make an appointment with your obgyn! I have had false negatives, but never had a false positive. GOOD LUCK!!|`|UwLYCl2taa	Yes, but it is mostly due to people taking tests too early.  My sister-in-law had that happen and she was in the process of losing the baby.  The doctors don't even look at that as miscarriage.  What happens is that the body rejects the pregnancy for whatever reason but the hormones are there to give a positive test.  But in the case of my sister-in-law, two months later she conceived again and had a healthy baby boy who is 7 now.|`|AA11766555	anything is possible|`|0e5f335b9ef0261a7abf1e33c21789b8aa	There are many many women who NEVER know they were even pregnant by what you just explained. Most don't test for pregnancy until after they don't get their period. It could be many things here. That you were pregnant but for some reason it isn't a viable pregnancy and now your period has started. It could be that the implantation of the baby started late and there wasn't enough hormone to stop your period from starting. Or you have a very healthy pregnancy and some bleeding can occur. None of us are your DR. and you should see your Dr. just to make sure or wait a week and see what is happening. But to answer your question....are there false positives........only if you read the pregnancy test after the required test time limit...some tests give a faint positive line after the testing time limit. If that isnt the case with you, then yours is a true positive.  Best of luck to Ya girl!|`|5e033d8c6271f9b8b1636fa167eb8cbeaa	Believe it or not but there are such things as false positives on an HPT but only in the instances of it being a defective product, or that you might be receiving some kind of HCG injection or something containing the HCG hormone.  But if you have taken more than one test with more than one different brand of home pregnancy test then I am going to say it is pretty safe to say that you are pregnant.  Congrats and best of luck to you|`|SzxTum5caa	I've never had a false positive (or a false negative for that matter), but I would see your OB ASAP about the bleeding.  You could be having what's known as a chemical pg where everything appears normal but the egg never implants.  You get a ++ HPT , then start AF a few days later.  Check it out and G/L to you.|`|f65e4d88e4864aeb622a06e622b5385daa	It's VERY rare to have happen.  When I got a positive HPT and called my doctor for conformation blood work they didn't even do it.  They told me a positive is a positive.|`|DettlETQaa	I'm guessing this is a joke??? Whether you're serious or not, you need to grow up.
f87de4651f89b32ac1a352f193de8127aa	It is definitely not NECCESSARY for kids to go to preschool. however, in this day and time most kids do in some form.  If you are encouraging good habits and providing them with stimulating and developmentally challenging toys and opportunities, then they will probably do just fine.  However, I teach Pre-K (4 year olds) at a private school and the social interaction with other children can be just as important as the academic side.  Children at our school really must recognize all their letters, numbers, shapes, etc. as well as know their letter sounds and be able to spell the color words and be able to already basically write their letters as well BEFORE entering Kindergarten to be able to keep up.  I would just look at where you are planning to send your child for Kindergarten and what is required before you decide.  I know that some people start a 3 year old for about 8 hours a week (4hrs. twice a week) and the class I teach is 4 hrs a day M-F (for a 4 year old).  Then again, if I were not teaching, I would be teaching my daughters Pre-K material at home and then sending them to Kindergarten, as long as I made sure I was providing them adequate opportunities for social interaction with other children.  It is really such a subjective topic and should be thought about carefully.  Also, I would not rush into any preschool program at all.  I would visit several and even sit in on a class or two.  Any program that frowns on parental involvement I would not trust.|`|dccb42df3c8daddfd79c083be2ac5972aa	3 to 4 years old is when they usually start pre-k. It's usually 3 mornings a week, from 8 to noon, and it is voluntary.|`|kVY9061Vaa	my son goes to kohanga reo in new zealand which is a maori pre-school, they have a school routine and it goes from 9am to 3pm monday to friday. he is 18months but most take from 0-6months up to 5.. he loves it|`|AA11713771	about four a lot of the time!!|`|ubMjx4EQaa	Most can start as early as 2. It is usually daily and in the morning. This can have benefits as your child will learn to interact with others. They'll also get used to a routine involving school and will be willing to go later.|`|Y60qZz9maa	Usually they can started @ ages 2 yrs old  and go from 9 to 12 and three days of the week. It is helpful in some way, because they started to learn and interactive with other children there same ages.
dcd1de17803a79e3f8899aed15210b60aa	No, it's fine. Even while taking the placebos in the pack she is still protected from pregnancy.|`|7a7330eb2ff515adb55d25158415c54faa	The pill is not 100% effective, nothing is. A friend of mine got pregnant even though she was on the pill. I remember my doctor telling me that it would take a month or two to fully take effect, so it is possible she could be pregnant. Even though she is on the pill, still use condoms (female or male) as another back up, that is what my boyfriend and I do (I worry a lot by nature also).|`|db1bee1992e6439478c94c69e5ad4b62aa	It should be fine. But the birth control pill is not 100%, many get pregnant on it. So I would use condoms along with her taking the pill for more protection. Otherwise, don't be shocked if one month you get some news about pregnany....|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	It's not 100%... I got pregnant off the pill.

YGH2hKiNaa	First we really need to know how old the both of you are and how long you have been in this relationship.

7HzfgRmwaa	hehe. your crunches don't affect your face! I think you have to wait til you deliver your child for that too! :( Don't worry - Im in the same boat!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	you cant do anything about it your spozed to be gaining weight not loosing it|`|hHQIUrNjaa	wait another 15 weeks and drop 10-15 lbs in about a day|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Chin crunches?|`|GDobAMQ8aa	. . . How would doing crunches get rid of a double chin?  Regardless, no, you shouldn't try to do crunches at this point.  Best thing to do is to keep an eye on your diet; eat healthily, trying to avoid overly starchy, fatty, greasy, etc. foods.  Also, get some regular exercise, even if it's just a 10 minute walk every day.|`|kbyU5Kbwaa	First of all, there's nothing you can do about a double chin during pregnancy, with all the stress your heart is under and your cardiac payload has increased due to the pregnancy your more likely to retain water, all pregnant women have some sort of fluid gain, thus swollen ankles, etc.....so I'd say in about 15 weeks you will your own bundle of joy and your double chin will be something of the past.  Most women loose a bunch of weight after delivery just due to fluid retention.  I'd also ask your doctor before doing any type of exercise.  You dont want to do anything that might jepordize your health or the babies health.  Enjoy your pregnancy and good luck!

BUT your friend maybe should visit the obgyn and an eye doctor? or shes just a liar.|`|KYU2Yl8Waa	No, no no and no! impossible. Men and women are specifically designhned to reproduce, that's what our divine purpose is. No, girls do not have ''sperm''. However, they do have testoterone, the male hormone. Both girls and boys have a little bit of eachothers hormone. But sperm is only in the male so that he can fertilize the female's eggs. Maybe she got drunk and had sex without knowing it.

As far as I know they haven't invented any dildos that ejaculate actual sperm. So NO she can not be pregnant from another girl! You need sperm from the semen of a male to get pregnant.

Take a test if you want to make yourself feel better.     It is probably a combination of PMS and anxiety that is making you feel sick.    If you had your period after you had sex, everything should have been flushed out in the process.
7Raehh4daa	I would suggest planning a "fun" way to greet dad when he comes home.  If you are excited about your brother coming back, your nephew will respond likewise.    Perhaps you could plan a way to surprise his dad; a drawing taped to the front door, jumping out of the closet, or singing a nursery song when he enters the door.  Get him doing something constructive and prompt him to do it for dad.  You could make a craft and suggest it be a gift for his father.  He could help you clean and when your brother comes home, you brag on your nephew's amazing ability to wipe the windows.  I hope these suggestions help!|`|K9G6n17Oaa	There's nothing that you can do to break him of this other than talk to his father. The kid acts in a way that he believes is acceptable and is required when he is around his dad. The problem is the dad, not the kid.     It sounds like you have the different kinds of interactions, boundries, and expectations with the kid as opposed to the kid and the father.    I rarely blame the kid for bad behaviour. Kids, if there are no physiological problems, general act in a way that they have been raised.|`|p7izYNBpaa	WOW i thought i was the only one, i have the same issue with the child i babysit, its slowly getting better. BUT to break the habit you have to not let him think he can get away with throwing fits, the reason he does it is to get their attention and attention is good but that kind of attention is bad and could turn into something worse. Try it and see if it works.
CRVi3YsOaa	no, the baby will either have type a or type o blood. and it will be positive. The only way a baby can get a negative type blood is if one of the parents has a negative blood type.  Here's my family blood layout  Dad- AB+   Mom- O+  Me- B+  Sister- A+  Brother- O+    but we all have positive blood types and all my kids have positive bolld types.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Short answer... YES but probably not.  I'll spare you the complicated explanation.|`|89qgMZjiaa	Yes.|`|u5BK6471aa	no...|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Doubtful, A is the stronger of the two..  Baby will most likely have A+ :-)
1NCPPHR9aa	Yes you can. You can even get pregnant while you are on your period. Anytime of the month, but it's not very common.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	Probably not. the zygote has to implant first and that takes time. The sperm does not meet the egg for a while after sex.  A heavy period makes it less likely.  Please take precaution in the future. Don't gamble with sex and pregnancy.  Do you enjoy feeling all worried about an unwanted pregnancy?  I doubt it, so take precautions.|`|IllWKAUGaa	NO!!! If you had your period, especially a heavy period, you are NOT pregnant...
S6Kb2VU9aa	Cloth Diapers are nothing like what they used to be - and so easy to use... we love them.. even Daddy doesn't mind!    1-  Liners is a term that is  sometimes used to refer to 2 different things, which makes it confusing.  Liners also called inserts are needed for pocket diapers. Most pocket diapers come with the insert so that is not an issue.  Then there are liners you can lay on top of the diaper. Some are disposable, which makes getting poop into the toilet easier, but I only used this if my daughter had not pooped  before going out.  There are also stay dry liners - if you use prefolds and a cover,  these are nice as they give baby that dry feeling.     2- They are super absorbant - and you can have multiple types in your stash depending on when you are using them. For example, we use FuzziBunz during teh day, but she super pees at night, so we either add an extra insert into the fuzzibunz diaper, or we use a bamboozle fitted diaper with a cover. No leaks!     3- They are convenient if you don't mind the extra load of laundry.  You can also use cloth wipes as you're doing laundry anyways.  When ougo out, I take a small wet bag with me, and a plastic container with a few wipes in it. It's just as easy as going out with disposables.     4- Velcro stick everywhere - and you have to make sure you use stick the velcro to the laundry tab. I prefer snaps, but I have a lot of velcro too, and it hasn't been an issue.     5 - They will last multiple children, if you care for them correctly. Even longer if you line dry them.       We love cloth diapering - and my partner doesn't mind it either, so much better for baby and the environment and yoru pocket book.     My favorite pocket diapers are FuzziBunz, we also love Bamboozle diapers. I also use a lot of prefolds during the day - they are the cheapest, and easy to use and clean.     You might also want to think about infant potty training - I was skeptical too at first - but wow - at 5 months, she owuld make an effort to pee and poop in her potty (and I'm not a crunchy kinda momma) at 9 months, she now poops 95% of the time in her potty (Baby Bjorn Little Potty)      If you have anymore questions, e-mail me, I'm happy to help.|`|pFw4HeiLaa	eeek.. no. you can get brand name diapers from places like baby box, most towns have them.. its for new moms.. dont go to diapers.. honestly its a mess|`|syrh8J6Vaa	To be honest I was given diaper service for a month as a gift.  I hated it!  The diapers do not have velcro.  You put the diaper on and then wrap diaper pants around it with the velcro.  It is very messy and time consuming.  The one thing that bugged me was when my son pooped and I changed him you have to clean out the diaper immediately.  So i would change him and run in the bathroom to get the poop out.  They also leaked a lot.  They were no where near as absorbent as a regular diaper.  Maybe you would have a better experience but I just really hated everything about them.|`|VBBxZV0caa	A real work-horse cloth diaper can last for quite a long time. I bought them for my 8 year old when he was a baby, and used them on my 4 yo, 1 yo, and am using them on my 1 month old. The only reason I had to buy more is to increase the stash because this is the first time I had 2 in diapers at the same time.  My favorites are Fuzzibunz (which held up the best and still look new) and Mommystouch (this diaper works on 8 to about 30 pounds!) Both run about $13 each. I've never used a liner in these. I chose to use a fleece liner with my newborns because I used prefolds until they were about 10 pounds. They seemed to fit best, and the fleece liner keeps bottoms dry. Both Fuzzibunz and Mommystouch have a built in fleece liner. You can add the .com to either diaper to investigate them.  Fuzzybunz are as convenient to change as a disposable. The Mommystouch has extra snaps to adjust them, so it takes a few times to get used to it and find the fit you like best.  I don't like velcro because it wears out much faster than the diaper, and yes...you could pull out a diaper chain, which seems to happen in the drier to a friend of mine.|`|yB5go5wbaa	It's not necessary to buy liners, but they could be helpful when you're going out and don't want to carry a stinky diaper around (just flush the biodegradable liner and wrap up the used diaper).  Liners aren't necessary though.    They're as absorbent as regular diapers and you can add doublers to increase absorbency.    They're less convenient because you've got to do 2 more loads of laundry a week.  But they're better for the environment and your baby's booty.    I bought prefolds and covers as well as BumGenius and Happy Heiny pocket diapers.    The velcro on the covers and the BumGenius and Happy Heinys have laundry tabs - they fold over so that the velcro doesn't stick together.  The velcro lasts longer too.    I bought used prefolds which were already used for 1 child and are still in perfect shape.  They actually get more absorbent with more washings.  I also bought used Happy Heiny's and the lady I got them from used them for two kids and the velcro and inserts are all in great condition too.    Check on craigslist and ebay for cheap used ones.  I only spent $200 for all of mine and they'll last through potty training.  Your babe won't get diaper rash either, because he won't be sitting in his pee or poop (they can feel the wetness quicker than with disposables and therefore "tell" you when they need to be changed quicker).  Kids potty train quicker with CD's too for the same reason.  Hooray!    http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/

ghz5D5iLaa	My kids did not like to take naps. The oldest quit when he was about two. He did sleep through the night when he was about three weeks old. I had tried to breast feed and he cried for three weeks. When he had formula he slept all night so I quit trying to breast feed. He was not getting what he needed from it. The next one quit taking naps around 10 months. If you put her down she would entertain herself but never sleep. She did sleep 7-9 hours a night though. The last one took naps until around three and a half. They were eating solid foods by the time they were one. They were all potty trained between two and a half and three.|`|jQwYoRCXaa	my daughter turned two in november and still occasionally takes naps...my son turned one in december and takes a couple naps a day. i honestly love it when they nap...i can do what i need to around the house or sit down and relax a little bit. in my opinion a child shouldnt be taken away from naps...my kids starting eating some solid foods around 6 months, they were eating almost all solid foods at 8 months. i started to potty train my daughter when she was around 14 months, she was doing good, but i wasnt consistent. for the last month she has been doing really good with using the potty...she wears dipars to bed or if we go somewhere, other then that she is dipar free. my daughter slept through the night within her first couple days home, my son does occasionally...well its about a 50/50 thing with him. since i had my son my daughter has woke up almost everynight...i dont know why, but all i have to do is cover her up and tell her shes okay, give her a kiss and she goes back to bed.|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	My son is only 5 months old, so of course he has his naps everyday. However, I plan to enforce a nap until the age of 3 or 4. I remember being in preschool at that age, and I had to take naps. There's nothing wrong with that. If anything, I'm sure it's good for them.     And at the age of 21, I still love naps! :o)|`|TkMwOjWDaa	Hello,  My 2 dauthers are now older and in school... but they were completely the opposite from one another when nap time was part of their routine.  My first daughter did not like to nap even when little... the easiest and most effective way for me to make her have a nap if I needed her to be good in the evening was to go out in the car for a ride with her...  At 2... she was skipping naps and she was ok until bedtime (around 7h00)...  My other dauther on the other hand needed a lot more sleep time and naps where essential for her on a regular basis about until 4 year old (naps got shorter and shorter...)    My Best advice would be:  Have as a regular schedule with your child as you can for the naps and bedtime...   Decide how late you want you child to go to bed in the evening and ajust the naps so you don't have a crying or sleeping toddler at dinner time) if you want him/her in bed early... maybe you can skip the naps out sooner ...    If on the other hand, if you enjoy having some extra quality time at night with your happy child ... you can pursuit the nap time longer to have an enjoyable evening    Make the decision for yourself and your family life...|`|pOEH4HLuaa	i stayed up till 12 my parents made me go at 7 or 8 but that never did work now i go to bed at 3 in the morning|`|n2O0NwR6aa	My daughter never took naps.  Even as an infant, she'd only sleep for 20-30 minutes at a time.  Once she was about 18 months, that was it - no naps ever.  My son, on the other hand, took naps until he was about 3 or 4.  About 1-2 hours in the afternoon.
cjqKMjWnaa	ditto to the above answer.  don't forget about all kids health care, which can cover whole families - husband too.  you may have to pay a (low) monthly premium, but it's all relative to your income.    if you're considering this option because life isn't going exactly the way you planned it, i strongly urge you to reconsider.  life hardly ever goes the way you plan ... and you have to think further down the road.  if you're planning on one day marrying your current boyfriend and having a family with him, do you want to live your life knowing that your first child together is part of a different family?  give it a lot of thought - and do research!  see what resources are out there, etc before making such a heavy decision.    i had my first child when my husband was still in school and we've been managing pretty well ever since.  things certainly aren't perfect - when are they, really? - but God has blessed us so abundantly and i'm so thankful to have had so many opportunities to see Him provide for our needs.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	Do what's best for all of you.

I did lose the babies but I have it stored downstairs in its box waiting for another little miracle to come along and make use of it.|`|LiPoEBenaa	I would buy it now.

I have been watching nanny 911. and the best thing you can do is every time you see him get on     1st time : say "no computer"  2nd time: say "no"  third time +++  : just pick him up and put him by his toys.    soon he will get the point it usualy takes like an hour.  but u will have to do this repeatedly everday ,    until he totaly stops.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	He is 3 lol, He wants to be like you possibly.  put it on sleep mode if you leave it.  Or distract him with something!|`|Lprtz2A9aa	It's the clicking noise the keyboard makes when they push the keys. My 1 year old loves playing with anything above his head. He wants to play on desks, the fridge, the table and the computer that has clicking parts? Irresistible!|`|z9DvICCuaa	so is my 2 yr old:)
TQW5E6olaa	I'm so sarcastic, it's hard for me to respond in a way that my sarcasm won't come across as bitchiness or as serious, when i'm not.     Am I harsh? I don't think so...|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I'm for the most part analytical.  Neither mean nor sweet.  I've come to realize that questions like the ones you posed are full of it and no matter what i say, it wouldn't matter.  i'm learning to not get baited into an argument. i'm maturing on ya.  haha  although i am still sarcastic when i feel like it.  i can't really turn that one off. too much a part of my personality.  i will usually write - this is sarcastic in case you couldn't tell.    really anything that harsh honesty is required i assume to be fake or the poster is too stupid to hear a different perspective.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	I'm totally in the middle.    Although with all questions, not just in the Pregnancy and Parenting section.|`|r07BwhO1aa	Depends on the questions, I am harsh on teen moms, but other ones I approach with a softer touch.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	depends on how crazy the question is.  sometimes a question deserves a smart-alecky response.  but that's hardly harsh.  what's harsh are some answers that insult, threaten, and even bash.  and sometimes you wonder what ticked that answerer off.  weird.  lol!  if it's a legit question in need of real help, yeah, i'm a softy.  but if the question is asking for it, yeah, i'll whip you some. :)    EDIT:  good lord!  pregnant and snorting??  i'll definitely be harsh!  i'll say something helpful yet said in a harsh manner.  i might even throw in a couple of *****.  lol!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I get really annoyed with all the stupid "Am I pregnant" questions. No offense, but a bunch of people on a forum can't tell you if you're pregnant. Or girls who try to say they have all the symptoms of a 3rd trimester pregnancy early on. I used to be a softy, but there are more serious questions that this could be used for. I find myself getting more and more harsh as well.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Not really lol. I just give my opinion. Doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right. Sometimes I can be harsh but sometimes the question deserves a harsh answer.|`|rUQAGz9kaa	people are asking for answers not opinions or judgements, your supposed to just answer the question and go.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Yes, I tend to be more harsh to the teen moms, and the kids on here that are like "Am I pregnant?" Like seriously. How are we supposed to know?
6mLQvA7iaa	My birthday is May 21st, and I love it... my presents are nicely spaced out, everyone's always here for my birthday parties, and it's always warm enough to do stuff outside without it being too hot.|`|QNuW7ivyaa	My birthday is March 11th.  311 - i get a band, its police code for indecent exposure, and it is usually the first, last, or dead center of a college spring break!     its far enough from any major gift giving holiday to avoid "doubleing up" of gifts, yet close enough to St. Patricks day to have a party with great drink specials!      I love my birthday! The only downside, is the "half-day" (6mo birthday), is Patriots Day (sept. 11th).  Which is one of the most depressing "holidays" ever.  Luckily, we rarely celebrate half-days anymore.|`|lHKQdwsnaa	i like my birthday march 14    as a kid my friend hated having her birthday in the summer  she was younger than her friends   and it was hard to get all of her friends together for a party  since families took vacations at different times|`|3LEPfzVhaa	11th January...  Its not so great, because its straight after Christmas, and I go to school to my friends who think they've finished spending their money on others (I know its nice but it does get tedious after a while, to the point where the phrase "Ah! That'll do!" Is used) and I remind them its my birthday.  I always tell people not to spend too much on me, as its not fair because its after Christmas. Plus I haven't got anything to look forward to!  I think I'd like a birthday in October, then I would be sixteen this year!|`|6C24kJhaaa	My birthday is January 28th. haha honestly as a kid i remember not liking the number 28 and therefore my birthday entirely. But i like the cold weather so i like january yeah. Weather and emotion probably have the most to do with it.|`|WEzv0n0Baa	January 1st. Had nothing to do with it, I was a drop out from a love in.      That was a funny,no?|`|laSYIzULaa	August 6th.   I think it is cool to have it during the summer.   I like that we are not in school so if I want to go somewhere out of town I totally can do it.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	June 27th. It's ok I guess. It's not on a holiday or right around so I never got gyped on the gifts :)|`|DNygQdmVaa	my birthday is january 19th,  I like it cuz its my birthday but i don like the weather
B6kgnh0jaa	This may be tmi but right before and after your period, your cervix should be low and hard..like the tip of a nose. with clean hands, you can put one or two fingers in you while you are sitting on the toilet...if you can easily feel it, it is low and you are not fertile...also your cm will be either dry or white lotion like. If you are fertile it will be higher..harder to reach and soft like the feel of lips...right before ovulation, your cm will be stretchy and like egg whites. This is when you should be having sex. I hope I helped, good luck.|`|0k5hixiWaa	Good question, because i dont know either and i would like to know too...?...mmmmm....

IGwX328eaa	Breastmilk storage bags are lined with nylon. This helps keep "the good stuff" (aka antibodies, leukocytes, nutrients, lipids) in breastmilk from sticking to the sides of the bag. Ziplock storage bags do not have that kind of protective lining. Additionally, they are more likely to bust at the seams which means that when the milk is defrosted it can leak out of the bag.    Some other long term storage options:    * glass baby bottles    * bpa-free plastic baby bottles    * freezer safe glass mason jars (pint)    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milks...|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Ziploc bags are not guaranteed to be sterile, and the regular bags are not thick enough to prevent freezer burn so I would recommend the milk storage bags or plastic or glass containers or bottles. I pump directly into gerber or evenflo standard bottles ($2-$3 each) and then freeze them with plastic wrap under the regular ring that you put the nipple in or a solid bottle top then when we need a bottle it just needs to be thawed out and it's ready to go, it's easier and cheaper in the long run plus there's no waste from all the plastic bags. I use plain address labels that you put through the printer to label the bottles.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	They have breastmilk storage baggies... and they have labels as well!! you can write the date and time everything you want on them.... and no i dont think that zip lock baggies are safe, i am sure they dont keep the breatmilk safe from certain things!     Plus the storage bags are not expensive|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	I would not zip loc baggies are not pre sterlized like the breast milk baggies. Or just by the bottles then you can re use them.|`|O4JuH8zmaa	You can but I wouldn't freeze them for very long like that. I personally love the lansinoh storage bags. You can write the date and amount of milk on the bags and if you freeze them flat they defrost very easily. They are a little bit more expensive but totally worth it.|`|Z67HkDKCaa	I would just until you can get out to get some milk storage bags - I would not want to risk losing some milk with one of the zipplocks ripping...besides they are not that expensive. The lansinon ones are like 50 for 8 dollars and you can write on them too.|`|GeMenejZaa	heck yeah, its what i did when ever i ran out of the breast milk storage bags. it doesn't really make a difference what they are stored in, and its normally cheaper too|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Thats perfectly fine to use, those breastmilk bags are a rip off I have never used them, way over priced, I actually use the small disposable containers you can get 5 for like AU$3. and I can keep using them over and over.    The person below said about them leaking this happened once and that was with a breastmilk storage bag, there was a small hole and it leaked, the best bet is the small snack containers, they are 200ml with sealable lids that dont leak and you can sterlise them, but it doesnt matter too much about sterlising because they get frozen, any germs will be killed in the freezing process|`|cjqKMjWnaa	personally, i don't like baggies of any kind.  the first time i tried one, i defrosted it only to find that there was a small rip in the bag that i hadn't noticed, so by morning, ALL of that milk (and time) was lost all over the shelf of my fridge.    to me, ziplocs just don't seem sanitary ... but i don't have any scientific proof to back that up.
M9wAOlk3aa	yes i think at 27 weeks they can be very sure but i understand what you mean on my scan 19 weeks they showed me and i clearly saw the three lines too but for some reason i still am afraid to 100  % believe it is a girl  maybe because i already have 3 boys|`|E2UXN7J1aa	You never know, but in this case I would say yes you can be pretty sure that is what you are having. Congrats and I hope this doesn't happen to us. I was told at 20weeks it was a boy and I've been buying boy stuff like crazy ever since! Anyway, good luck!|`|R2OMEjrhaa	Yea if you can she the three lines it is a girl. They thought my daughter was a boy at first too. Then they took a better look and saw the three lines. And now I have a beautiful 21 month old daughter.      Congrats|`|n4YwNJViaa	Most likely your having a girl, 19 weeks is still a bit early to be sure, but those three little lines don't lie most times!! Congrats!!|`|T1hZG4O3aa	I would have to say that you are having a girl. The same thing happened to my mom when she was pregnant with me. They told her that she was having a boy at 19 weeks. She never went back for another U/S because she didnt need one and so they went on believing it was a boy. Obviously it was too early to tell because sure enough when I came out I was a girl. I dont trust U/S scans before 21 weeks unless the U/S tech is very skilled but you just never know until you baby comes out. If you are still worried, buy neutral colored clothing to be safe. We were told we were having a girl at 19 weeks and i only bought neutral clothing until birth just in case if turned out to be a boy. But it was a girl for me. Grats and good luck|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Sounds like a baby girl... my sono has three little white lines!!
s6stLtvLaa	I was lucky enough to grow up with my half sister.  It amazes me every day how different we are.  My sister and my mom were my best friends growing up.  I was so grateful to have her in my life.  She is only 18 months younger than me, but when we were younger she HAD to go everywhere with me!  It drove me nuts!  I had to read and sing her to sleep every night.  Looking back though I miss doing that.  My sister and I have nothing in common, but we love each other so much and couldn't imagine being without each other.  We both know that we had at least two older half brothers, and I would love to be able to meet them.  As a result of being adopted with my sister I have always wanted to adopt sisters (or a brother and a sister) so I can give two siblings the chance to grow up together instead of being separated.|`|p61Ccuvyaa	i was adopted with my biological brother and i had a adopted sister adopted with her biological brother. my adoptive parents have 1 child of there own. for me my life was wonderful.. and for real we all favor each other in one way or another..  i am 29 and the youngest of the 5.. i feel like my parents never stressed the fact that we were adopted that we were all theres and that was that.. i have just started to try to find my biological mother.. they say blood is thicker than water but that is not true my parents loved all of us the same and as long as you are always honest with your girls support them in  anyway possible i think that they will feel no different than the neighbors who have there own .children.. it is all in how you raise them.. my mom and dad are my mom and dad they raised me and they ceaned my scraps and bruises they were there graduation and marriage and grandchildren... just always always be there for them|`|hjvlKImXaa	If you ask them here, even if they have had "pleasant" experiences, they will tell you how horrible it was and pretend that their lives are nothing but filled with turmoil ~ becoming the ultimate victims.|`|07YBD5mJaa	I was in foster care for five years. My first few foster homes were not the best, and I struggled to find a "home" where i felt wanted. My foster family's always treated me as a pay check, never as part of their family. It was very hard, I felt unwanted, and lost at times. I finally met a family through my church, and they took me in. Hopeful to finally have a real family based home. It was great for the first few months, they really treated me nice, gave me more freedom as a teen ager, and always seemed so real. It was great. Then something went wrong....feelings changed. I turned 18, and I noticed how differently they treated me. I was no longer allowed to join them for family events, anything i needed I was expected to pay for...which most of the time was school supplies and personal hygiene materials. I picked up a part time job, while still a senior in high school. But it wasn't enough for them. I felt like I was walking on egg shells in their home. I had lived with them for two years, and I had been so used to being able to just be myself..after I turned 18 I had to completely change who I was and what I did. I had no clue how to act around them, what to say, I felt like i was unwanted in their home. Their eldest daughter, who was 17, had always been super close to me, we were the best of friends. however, when this started to happen, she treated me horrible, she would tell me things like " your not part of this family any more, we don't get paid to have you here". and so did the parents...it seemed every day I was hearing this. It broke my heart...i thought i was part of their family, and because they stopped receiving weekly pay checks for me, they treated me horrible. I don't say this as a child jealous of material things, I say this as an adult who had to live through this. I was kicked out after I graduated...I came home from college classes one night to find my personal belongings on the streets. I have never talked to this family again. I was never allowed back, nor was I allowed to visit. I considered these people my family, and they threw me out because of money.     I am now 22 and Married.  I will never forget what happened to me, but I do not let it bring me down.    My only advice, please love your adopted child as your own. Don't give up on them because the state stops sending weekly paychecks.   Don't let them feel as if they are any different than your family. Let them know you love them, every day.  Be supportive, as you would your own child.  raise them, as you do your own children.    I wish you the very best of luck!|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Nope.  I was first born.  I don't know if there are other Tempes running around.|`|AA11922229	Yeah, my father had four wives each with kids all living on the same street. The little ones ranged the same ages in each household. My mother was such a big B, 8 offspring were all adopted out. My fathers second mate took three of us in, so we  lived with our half brothers and sisters until we were old enough. Our step mother was nursing her youngest, and I was adopted at one week of age, so we shared the same nipples for two months. I was raise up healthy and happy. We played together continuously, day and night, until we all went our own ways. I sure do miss them all. We were one big happy family. And that's the story my dog told me last week.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Nope.     My full three siblings live with my biological parents.   I feel sorry for them being raised by such dynsfunctional people.     However, I wish I could have them in my life but my biological mother trash talks about me around them so they hate me.     But then again at least this mental wacko never got her hands on me, thank god.
MCTyWCu2aa	My friend did it and it was 600 dollars.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	That baby didn't ask to be conceived and its not its fault that it was conceived during a rape situation. Abortion is murder and no baby deserves such a cruel fate. If she doesn't want it, she can carry it to term and then have a loving family adopt it.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	$800.|`|ui7waO1haa	$800. Rape or no rape, it's still MURDER!|`|NI8D46J0aa	Did she tell you a week ago, or it happened a week ago? She wouldn't know yet, but she needs to go to a dr and the police immediately. I am not sure how long you can get one or how much they cost.|`|YspTfI8Faa	Adoption would be a lot better. There are couples out there that can't get pregnant and would probably appreciate your bundle.|`|GlzVQclpaa	About $500 give or take. You can only have it done up to like 10 weeks or around there.|`|BepzNmowaa	in arkansas its around 600.  but you should try to think about keeping th baby or adoption.  rape is a sad thing but a baby could bring alot of joy into your life or maybe someone elses.   even though the baby isnt yours then you might want to consider keeping it|`|mP82VSO1aa	Usually between 400-800, depends on where you live/where you go. As for those saying it's murder, I personally think you're all rather high on yourselves. If they don't want to live with the little reminder of some low-life, it's their right to handle the situation however they feel comfortable. Be more respectful.|`|tDEiKXIQaa	adoption is the better option abortion kills the baby and it is not the babies fault . God Bless

I think about the little one though and I can't wait to see how much of a bruiser he is on the football field! He's already 26lbs at 8 months.. can you imagine his size at 16 and the kind of linebacker he will be? Even his doctor says every visit, "You know there is a college scout checking him out already right?"    Okay, okay... I can't force any of this on him but growing up in our family it would be hard NOT to be a sports fanatic.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	I can't wait to take her to feed the ducks at the park.

mgiJVjaKaa	You may not be having sex on your most fertile days. Even couples who are actively trying to get pregnant only have a 25% chance of getting pregnant each month. So no, it's not unusual that you haven't gotten pregnant. Once you actively start trying - if you still don't get pregnant after 6 mos - 1 year, then be concerned and talk to your dr.|`|o1yy6KABaa	I think you may have just been very lucky so far not to get pregnant - that and it can take a few months for the birth control to get out of your system.  Remember though, that although you have been lucky up until now the pull out method is very risky to use - use a condom!|`|scDrMchMaa	A couple years back my boyfriend and I were sexually active... alot lol. i was on birth control for a couple months but got off of it because i just didnt like it, i made me really hormonal... but anyway while i was on the birth control he got into the habit of going in me. and when i went off the bc, ha didnt stop going in me... i dunno why it was just some kind of turn on i guess lol. but anyway he would go in me almost every time we had intercourse, which was quite a bit. i didnt get pregnant, and always recieved my monthly friend on time... but a few years down the road i am now pregnant and got pregnant within 2 months of trying... i have no clue why i didnt get pregnant for the many months of unprotected sex before but i am now and got there pretty easy lol... i thought i wasn't able to get pregnant.|`|bcZSIphUaa	Pumpkins!
ntdGOZqGaa	Sounds like teething to me! I would give him some tylenol like you are doing, plus with my son I would rub vanilla on his gums with my finger( the ingredient) it numbs it like orajel but tastes a whole lot better and isn't bad for them. Plus with mine I would buy him those ginger snap cookies, they are hard as heck and he could just chew and chew and wouldn't be able to break pieces off. My son wasn't big on teething rings either but he would sometimes chew on a cold rag that I would put in the freezer for him. That's pretty much all I can tell you to do and just grit and bear it! It will soon pass, but then be followed by more teeth ha ha. Once you find what works just stick with it! My son is 2 yrs old and getting is last molars in the back and he is fussy,and doesn't really want to eat and wants a bunch of attention. Hope this helps you some|`|JQZDCcyQaa	They can teeth for for months before actually getting a tooth, so it does sound like it. I have say that alot of the time its a guessing game anyway to what is wrong with them. I notice with my daughter she mostly gets cranky when they are moving around but when the actual tooth comes through she isnt so bad, so hang in there, once you see that tooth he will be heaps better. Let him suck on a wet washcloth my daughter liked that|`|n6XYYyoLaa	could be teething esp with the  drool and waking; are his gums swollen or changed color? try rubbing around his gums with your finger and see if you feel anything different than the smooth gums he would have if he weren't teething..also, u  can call the doc and see if he can have motrin; if it is teething, it helps with pain relief and inflammation, swelling; u might not see a tooth for a good while and it may stop and start again if it is teething; my gal always drools but goes through stages where she is ok without meds, and then times when she needs them|`|cjqKMjWnaa	i remember my first daughter going through something very similar when she was about 4 months old.  i thought it was teething, but she didn't get a tooth for a couple of months, so i don't think it was.  she did get better though and started sleeping through the night again.  drooling can be a sign of teething, but i have found that it doesn't ALWAYS mean so.  my 2nd daughter (10 months) just got her top 4 front teeth in almost all at the same time.  her symptoms were a slight fever (around 99) for a few days and general grouchiness ... she was a lot more sensitive, wanted to be held all the time, and very moody.  it was about a week and then i started feeling her top teeth coming in (still couldn't see them though).  a couple of days later, they were visible.  hope this helps.  hang in there!
t8HPCzrOaa	lol hey hunn this is a funny question not to be rude cause i had sex jan 20 and had my period on jan 24 lol opppsite of us and i also was thinking if its still a chance also i had sex on jan 30 right after my period but i think you should wait a while and take a test if you think u r pregnant and if u do get pregnant please let me koe cuz i want to know if i can also i been trying to conceived good luck hun|`|wBpennsMaa	There is always a chance of pregnancy if you have sex, even if its protected.|`|7xit1ogxaa	Yes, anytime you have unprotected sex you have a chance of becoming pregnant.|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	If what everyone has told me is right, there is a super good chance that you could become pregnant.

28VX3LaNaa	Go to Yahoo.com then type in chicken poxs while pregnant? It will pull up what you need. baby center.com is good. gyn.com is too!|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Now, I haven't had it but I went and got the vaccine today and they said to make sure i'm not pregnant when i get the vaccine and within a month of it. They said there could be some developmental problems for the fetus. I looked up more info on it when I got home. I found this: There is a theoretical risk that when administered one month prior to or during pregnancy, the vaccine may cause birth defects similar to those that can occur from natural chickenpox (for example, limb abnormalities including absence or underdevelopment; abnormal brain development; mental retardation; scarring of the skin; eye abnormalities).
2nWKxv7Waa	i would not worry too much dear. i was 6 weeks pregnant with my son when i began spotting. when they did an u/s they could only see the sac and no baby. i went back one week later and there was my baby--beating heart and all. they htink cause i had been bleeding that was why they could not see the baby. i have a very healthy and active 4 1/2 yr old son.    and since you are only 5 1/2 weeks along and with twins, i would not be too concernced until they check you at your next appointment.    my sister in law was told she was miscarrying her baby cause they could only see a sac and no baby, she went to her dr the next week and there he was. he is a healthy 9 month old now.    congrats on your pregnancy, and try to think positive thoughts dear.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I understand that this is very frightening, but you don't have enough information yet to know what is going on.  I have never heard of "blighted ovum".  I don't think it is a very technical term.  Call the ultrasound person and find out   what size is normal for twins at this age.  Don't you have a OB/Gyn?  It sounds like the reassurance of a doctor would be so helpful for you right now.  Here is a good site on the development of twins:  http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-feta...  Look at this yourself. I am thinking that your babies are fine.  Don't get so worried that you hurt yourself and the babies.  They aren't very big yet. It is so early.|`|gpON465Iaa	No, maybe|`|qX8EFFVtaa	At 5 1/2 weeks pg, you will not be able to see the embryos on an ultrasound.  You will probably just be able to see the dark gestational sac.  Don't worry.  In couple more weeks, you'll be able to see it better.  If you had a blighted ovum, your hcg levels would be declining.

CRVi3YsOaa	my daughter will be 4 in may. she is special needs, and still does not talk so she started school on her 3rd birthday. At first i was taking her in a she fussed a little. But now, every morning i get her up, and when the bus gets here she runs out to it. I have another daughter that turned 5 in november but she started pre-k when she was 4 and she loves it, would you believe she cried when she left her first day of school because she had to leave her school supplies at the school. She was just so upset that she had to come home. But i think it is all in how you prepare your child for school. as to how they will handle it.|`|5ZvALiclaa	My daughters birthday is June 18 so she was literally the youngest in the prep year. She was only just 4.5 when she started in the january. However it made no difference to her. She kept up with the best of them and has been reading and writing at the top of her class (she just started year 2 this year) and only got 2 questions wrong out of 100 in her maths test last year. For her, it has been a very easy adjustment, although she was tired a lot in the first month or too when she got home, but thats normal.     It really depends on your daughter though. While mine may find it easy, others that were born a couple of months earlier have struggled a bit. If you help her, get her ready by making sure she knows counting, alphabet, shapes, colours etc..and is used to being around other children in the kinder type setting she will probably do fine. It has a lot to do with parental encouragment and positive reinforcement with homework. If you help her and prepare her she will be fine!    My son starts prep next year and will be turning 5 about 2 weeks after they start so its going to be interesting to see if that 6mths age difference actually makes a difference. My baby boy will be 5.5 yrs old when he starts prep as he is born july 13 (just after the cut off) so it will be equally interesting to see how he goes.    good luck
HyknHVV5aa	Well, all you really NEED is a crib, a change table, drawer chest, and a rocking chair. Once you have that, you can go with a theme.

YOU DONT HAVE TO BUY FROM THERE YOU CAN JUST GET IDEAS. GOOGLE IT AND LOOK AROUND. YOU WILL COME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA.|`|ui7waO1haa	Take into consideration the sex of the baby. Is it a girl? Is it a boy? If it's a girl, think of butterflies, ladybugs...girly things. If it's a boy, think of John Deere, firetrucks, farm animals, etc. Take into consideration the budget. Are you willing to go all out or are you wanting to keep your wallet full? All these need to be taken into consideration before doing your baby's nursery to ensure the full effect of your wants and needs. If your money is tight, you can still do a lovely nursery on a budget! Good luck!
7HzfgRmwaa	Uhm - sure! I used to cramp really bad after sex when I was pregnant the first time. Unfortunately i miscarried that pregnancy and I think it was related. Are you pregnant? BC if you are cramping after sex is a bad sign.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	He probably just hit your cervix. He needs to be sure and not thrust too deeply at certain times of the month because the cervix changes position. It is a similar sensation to a man getting hit in the testicles. Tell him to be a little less rough!|`|k0QRfQ00aa	When this happened to me it did get so bad I did go to the ER and found out I had a bacterial infection. I thought I was bleeding but wasn't and one time I actually bled It was so bad I couldn't walk at all. If I were you to be on the safe side talk to your doctor about it to make sure everything is ok. Good luck to you.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	See your gynecologist pronto. Sounds like more than just cramps, but not pregnancy.    There are other conditions that can cause this, including diseases like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or even endometriosis. It would be wise to get checked out so you can have some peace of mind.|`|QFf9phAmaa	avoid during period time.it must be safe.
Wh6DvhE6aa	All normal!  I had 2 kids 17 months apart and my hubby coped it both times!  Poor bugger.  He called me Regan (from the Exorcist).  Between that and my gas - he coped it on both fronts.  LOL.  Cant do much about it - just ride the waves.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Ohhh, hormones.  Last week I cried at the grocery check out lane.  I yell at my boyfriend, too, but tell him I'm sorry every night, haha.

ZIq2IzOmaa	You take birth control pills every day at the same time of day. If you miss pills or you are late taking them, then you are more and more likely to get pregnant.     So no, you do not take pills only when you have sex. You choose a time, like right after breakfast or a certain time of the day and stick to it. Pills come in a pack that lasts a month, so you take one pill each day until you've finished the pack, then you start a new pack.     You stay on birth control for as long as you want to use birth control to avoid getting pregnant. You don't have to keep taking it for a long time, but you cannot just stop on a random day. You'll need to finish the last pack that you've started.     If you mean that you'll get pregnant just from no longer taking the pill, that's not how it works. The pill prevents pregnancy by stopping ovulation or changing the environment of the uterus. This works to keep the man's sperm from uniting with the woman's egg, which creates a pregnancy. So as long as you are not having sex, you will not get pregnant just from stopping the pill.     From your question it looks like you need a LOT more information about sex, birth control, and how pregnancy happens. Please, please, please talk to your doctor or a responsible adult about these questions before you have sex.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	How old are you? You take your first one a day or two before sex and dont stop taking them until your ready for a baby. One everyday.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	You need to take the birth control pills as long as your having intercourse without missing one.|`|VVQv9GX1aa	I think you need to speak to your doctor to get a better understanding.    When you start taking birth control pills you should be on them for at least a month before having unprotected sex (if that's what you are planning on doing) to make sure your body agrees with the pills.    You take 1 pill the same time every day, not only after sex (yes you can say that word).    If you're not having sex, but plan on doing so on another day, you still need to be taking the pills.  You can't just stop and start all the time because it's not going to work properly and will mess up your cycle.    I really suggest you talk to your doctor about this because you don't seem to know what you should.    -Remember that birth control does not prevent you from getting an std, so you really should use condoms every time.
KoEipToJaa	It sounds like you were very responsible with the whole thing. I would not say you are too young, 16 really isnt that young compared to all the younger teens out there having sex. On the subject of early, 7 months is quite a while to wait.... and that is a good thing. I think your mom just reacted that way because she was shocked, and in her eyes you will always be "too young". Plus she is just worried about the normal things that come along with sex, like the chances of pregnancy and the emotions it entails. So don't be sad she reacted the way she did, it seems like a normal reaction for any concerned mother and she probably just needs a little time to come to terms with the fact that her little girl is all grown up :) ya know. So no worries hun she will come around and if she doesnt bring it up in the next couple days or so talk to her again about it and i am sure she will handle it much better. good luck, and the best for you and your man :).|`|tjPMvuFXaa	In my eyes you are to young, but it was your decision, and I think you were very mature for asking your mother to go on the pill.   She needs to think of it that way...|`|6BAb9eawaa	no, people are having it at 14. shame shame!  but yeah anyways use protection and convince your mom to get the pills.|`|V9iW4WlLaa	I think that it isyour mom who is not being the mature one and if she acts like that you are jsut going to do it anyway so why not make sure you are doing it responsibily and using protection.    Talk it out with her, if not if you still choose to do it, use a condom.|`|OwABxRGZaa	I can see why she would think that, but realistically, today girls are having sex much younger.  You were smart about it and didn't hide it. She needs to see that you were mature for wanting to be protected.|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Hunny you didn't have sex to early because you were ready to have sex at that age. no you are not too young, but people have different views on it. She should support you, at least you want to be safe! Your nearly 17 and old enough to do what you want and control your own life.    Why dont you get them yourself? Your old enough sweety. Your mum should not have acted this way.      Have a nice day    Cazzy xo|`|XgSysUjnaa	Everyone is ready at a different age. And lets face it, there are 13 year olds effin other 13 year olds.|`|tw4jlsUxaa	well to be honest the fact that you were ready, and the fact you're over the legal age, means you're probably not too young.     but it's like natural for parents to think that.  she'll most probably think you're 'too young' for a while yet.     don't worry though, as long as you stay safe and all that then your mum will probably be okay in the end.|`|tInyWdptaa	It is young. but u sounded quite sure u were ready  I think that asking your mom for pills shows that you are mature enough to deal with being sexually active and any consequences that may come from that decision. I would say keep talking to you mom about it. She will realize that you are mature enough to make these decisions.|`|rbhLb3FYaa	You are too young, you're still a child to her. She should respect that you want to be responsible though, this is your way of trying to be responsible. Also at 16, you can legally get the pill on your own.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	While you shouldn't have had sex as teen(allowing yourself a couple more years to emotion n' psychologically mature), the fact that, you asked your mother for BC pills and, a gynecologist says that you are definitely taking responsibility.|`|8Z1QK6T2aa	There isnt a truly "right" age to have sex, what with everyones morals and situations being different, Im 17 planning a wedding to my boyfriend, weve been dating 4 yours,hes the only guys ive ever been with, our moms supports up but does silently wish we would wait a little longer.   I belive the way you handled your situation show your maturity level and that mybe you are ready as long as you take the proper precautions which you ARE doing. So good luck.|`|yUFnBeeKaa	I personally think it's too early, but you waited til you were ready so you probably were ready. I don't think your mom should have yelled at you for it and I think it was a good thing you asked for the pill. You knew you were ready for sex so don't tell people you weren't ready. That's something only you can decide. I think you should talk to your mom about it again and see what she says.     Hope this helps :)|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Age isn't an issue, as long as you know how to be safe, and realize how important love is when it comes to sex.    Tell your mom that at least you're trying to be safe, and if she still gets upset, take the initiative and go yourself. If you go to Planned Parenthood or the Health Department, you can get free pills and you don't need a parent.

I looked like I was a little chubby at 3 months and I started to show at 5 months (it was a lot harder to hide any ways) But that was just me.  Everyone is different. She is much shorter and there is no where to go but out for her so she may begin to show a little earlier, but then she weighs a little more and if she eats right she may not make much of a change until around 5 months.|`|pSmhybA4aa	probably like 3 or 4 months because she is short, i didnt start really showing till 6 months and everyone said it was beacause i was tall (im 5"9) and have a long torso|`|v8QWkWrOaa	when i was pregnant i weighed the same as amanda and i am 5' 4". i didnt start showing until almost my sixth month so she may show until around the time. so you might want to look forward to it anywhere between five to seven months. hope this helps

Una vez, que tuviste tu primera menstruacin habiendo consumido ya una caja de pastillas, durante todo un mes, puedes dejar el preservativo y slo tomar pastillas (en el caso de que tengas una pareja estable).  La duda de quedar embarazada an tomando pastillas,la tienes que tener cuando aparte de tus pastillas anticonceptivas, ests tomando algn antibitico (por una faringitis, bronquitis o infeccin de cualquier tipo), y no hayas utilizado algn otro mtodo ms (preservativo)....ya que los antibiticos alteran la flora intestinal y se producen alteraciones en la absorcin de los anticonceptivos, que hace que tal vez no te cubra lo suficiente para evitar el embarazo. Perdn si fue extenso, pero es bueno para "desasnar" a  quien lea esta respuesta. Disculpa mi tiempo.|`|PHrOSQFVaa	Daniela:    No es suficiente utilizar mtodos anticonceptivos, sino utilizarlos bien para que cumplan su funcin. La primera vez que se empieza a tomar la pldora debe hacerse el primer dia de menstruacin, no el ltimo. Si lo has hecho mal, entonces no se asegura su eficacia anticonceptiva. Esto no significa que en tu caso haya embarazo, pero durante este nuevo envase utiliza el preservativo adicionalmente, hasta que el orgnismo se adapte.

Bye cuidate... no te inquietes, es seguro bye
eKtEWrcmaa	It sounds like their hearts were in the right place but their heads weren't.     Wanting to make a difference in the children's lives was admirable. However, if not financially stable and prepared to deal with extreme cases it wasn't the best plan to put into action on such a large scale. It wasn't just that the families weren't financially stable individually but the entire community sounds like it struggles.     Expecting other communities regardless of how close to care and be involved is also unrealistic. They got their own community into the cause and should not expect others 30 miles away to feel passionate or drawn to help in any way. I personally could care less about most things that happen in the next town over let alone the one 30 miles away. Its not that I do not like the people there or anything like that but I work in my own community on causes we have. I shouldn't be expected to run over to the next town and throw in a hand on their causes.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	They did an unbelievably unselfish thing. Sad when your own neighbors don't realize that.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I think it was a bit irresponsible.  People should adopt children because they want to and if they can afford (emotionally and financially) to raise the child the way he/she deserves to be raised- not because your pastor tells you that you should.  The whole thing sounds fishy to me in a way- like they expected surrounding towns to jump right in a help them.  It would have been great if they did, but they shouldn't have expected it.  i don't know if the kids are better off or not- I hope their famillies don't resent them or anything.  I guess they are doing the best they can.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Mixed feeling is right.    I agree with the above posters especially the comments about the pastor but lets also keep in mind.....Racism is alive and well in the US.    These child do need more support and its unfortunate they are the second to last priority of US citizens right behind illegal immigrants forced into the US.|`|XyU6oEVPaa	In the state of Texas, as of April, 2007, the adoptive parents of a child who is adopted from Foster Care receive from the state monthly $400 per child.  There is also state supported Residential Treatment that is in addition to that offered by Medicare.  They receive a $1500 one time non recurring expense subsidy, and other subsidies from the State of Texas and the Federal Government.  Those payments dont usually decrease, so one could assume that they have increased in the past couple of years.      http://www.nacac.org/adoptionsubsidy/sum...    I am sure that this started out as an Act of charily on the part of the minister, but I also think that they are being compensated for their charity.      I also know that in Texas there is a huge amount of prejudice, still.   Remember the horror story in Jasper, which is also part of Texas and not that far from this place.  The prejudice is deep seated, and the hatred and mistrust is on both sides.  I think that there is a lot of truth in what the minister says and that is indeed a factor.  The community of the churches should help support this, as well, and clearly they are not.      Where is the church community with their help other than to continue to wrest adoptable healthy babies from mothers to atone for their sins?  Why are they not supporting families, supporting these children and supporting the churches that do things like this?  I think that the biggest failure here is the failure of the Christian Community and rightwing fundamentalists who are banging the drum against abortion to truly walk their talk. Instead,  it shows their agendaGet the babies, stop them from aborting, but then forget it.someone elses problem!|`|b26Dp8LKaa	Matthew 6:1 Take care! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired, because then you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.   2 When you give a gift to someone in need, don't shout about it as the hypocrites do--blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I assure you, they have received all the reward they will ever get.  3 But when you give to someone, don't tell your left hand what your right hand is doing.  4 Give your gifts in secret, and your Father, who knows all secrets, will reward you.    Sorry...couldn't help myself.  You'd think a pastor would know this!  Just had to add my 2 cents...to the many good answers already given.|`|MzHwklzKaa	So, a predominantly poor town took on more than they could handle and want to be thanked for it?    Why?    They knew they were poor.  They knew those kids would have a hard time.  Yet, they did what they did, and now they want, what?    A hand out?    That makes absolutely no sense.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	The more I read in to the article, the more it seems the pastor wanted some more notoriety. I was all about getting upset thinking Texas had dumped a bunch of kids in to a poor community.....but that does not seem to be the case at all.     Don't adopt foster kids because you think it will get you a pocket of money, a hand shake, a pat on the back or in to the gates of heaven any easier.....it seems he may have missed that message.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	I wonder if this pastor was more in love with the publicity than the children.  Oprah, Warren, high profile news coverage....I think he started with good intentions, but the media attention fed his ego just a bit too much.    Programs such as this need to be very well organized and planned to be a success.  Counting on celebrities and the press to help your cause will only work short-term, a long-term plan should have been in place.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Before I read the other responses, my thoughts went immediately to the Bible.  Jesus condemned those who stood on the corner and shouted about their good deeds.  Charity should come from the heart, not from the desire to gain notoriety.    But Robin beat me to the punch.  Yea Robin!    Like you, I have mixed feelings.  How could anyone argue against adopting children who need stable homes?  The families should be applauded.  But on the other hand, it's a shame the pastor has cast a shadow over his flock.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	WTF.... what a self esteem booster this article must be for these teens.    No one deserves a pat on the back, this was a social experiment. There is NOTHING that would make mw think any less of my kids. There s nothing that can make them anything less of a Miracle to me. Not doubt these kids came with a check and medicaid, what else do they want?    Oh yes.... gratitude    This article makes me angry on so many levels I can't even put them into words.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	They didn't think about it long term did they...    Though even in a poor family the kids can still flourish if they feel safe and loved by those around them. (Their life before hand didn't hold any hope, so at least now they still have some hope. No I'm saying they need to 'grateful' to them, just it has to be better than living on the streets.)    But the kids are there now and the families need help so why doesn't the church start its own community aid. Band together more, rather than expecting everyone else to do it. Government aid will only take a town so far...    They do all sorts of things the help each other out and not rely on the 'white' towns to support them. (That kind of talk irritates me, what's a persons colour or race have to do with giving a mate a hand when they need one. And I don't like coming from either 'black' or 'white' people. Its just a way to keep everyone inside their little boxes. ) The town could start their own veggie gardens for food, or buy a few cows for meat and milk and hold fund raises, lots of things they can do to change the situation..... Good luck to them, the kids still need some hope of good humanity.    The quotes Robin gave are spot on- he's a minister, he should be trusting more in God and pray...    Edit; Sly, I've heard that about Texas but i thought it was just exaggerations. Texas sounds more like outback Aust, or Arnhem land where there is more division but mainly because a lot of the Aboriginals chose to live traditional lifestyles over western. Must be the heat......|`|q4EXFhV7aa	"A decade later, the families who took part are struggling to raise troubled children in a poor, rural town. And Bishop W.C. Martin is frustrated by the lack of support his black church has received from surrounding communities, which are mostly white.  "Do you think for one moment they recognized us?" Martin said, his voice rising like he's delivering a Sunday sermon. "For being the entity that brought the type of recognition to this town? Nothing. Not even a thank-you letter. It's pitiful."    I don't know why this pastor believes that he should be praised and thanked for pressing impoverished people to adopt impoverished, abused children.  I think that their friends and family and church community should be supportive of them.....NOT 'thankful' or 'grateful'.   Does this have to do with racism, as the pastor suggests? Perhaps....but it doesn't matter. EVEN IF other local towns aren't 'thanking' these people and this church because they hate black people, that doesn't negate the fact that those people didn't sign on to parent and care for these children.   It just seems like they--or this pastor at least--are heavily focused on everyone else owing them something for their good deed. Adopting children from foster care isn't and should NEVER be about 'good deeds,' but about caring for a child in need of a family and home. This decision should be personal and shouldn't demand that other people agree with or financially support you in your decision. On a bright note, I am happy that the children are doing quite well, given their difficult starts.
MCTyWCu2aa	Just straight out tell them. Thats what i had to do and im 17 (dont know how old you are so dont know how bad it will be for you) my parents were suprisingly understanding.|`|74fe5c642d059f46a34e9d235a375172aa	My husband was with me wen I go to doctor to check if I got pregnant, and my mom works in that hospital, so it wasn't that surprising when they know I got pregnant|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	It really depends on how old you are. Most of the time just telling them you're pregnant is accepted with happiness. There are those exceptions when you're younger, and I mean very young, when you should have a for sure answer that you are pregnant, then just sit your family down and give them the news. There's really no way to hide it, and your family will notice. Just be honest, I'm sure they will understand.|`|9op65iQVaa	well it all depends on the situation.. Are you breaking the news to them or are you giving them news....thats the difference|`|dBdQB4KHaa	Bring them to diner thin make a toste or have a cake come out with the good news.!! Congradulations!!|`|IBOcGSGlaa	it really does depend on how your family is because everyone's family is not the same. If your young they may be less supportive. Althought having a baby is suppose to be a joyous event sometimes it can be very depressing because there are many times when family member cut their children off due to unplanned pregnancies. Just find the right time to tell them and i hope you are very responsible because if you are then they have nothing to worry about.. now you have your own family to live for.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I just said hey mom guess what? I am pregnant. She got so excited to see that I was excited also.|`|ZeNemqcMaa	I told them seperately and I was sobbing pretty much the whole time, my pregnancy was unplanned and I am still in college, they reacted suprisingly well and were super supportive. I really thought they would completely cut me off but they didnt. Once I had told them they told me to just go relax and not think about it, and we would talk about it when I was more composed adn ready. Each time we talked they were willing to listen to what I thought adn wanted and were behind me on everything. Unfortunately I lost my baby at 10 weeks, but I was so glad I had told them because I don't know how I would have gone through everything without them.|`|c97b62c8660b1041d9759f33d466797faa	first, you really have to make sure you ar epregnant by getting some lab tests done...    and then, plan a simple dinner or so, for the family..    or if you want, tell your husband first and surprise him then the both of you can plan how to tell both sides of the family..    good luck and congrats!|`|OYu53GRqaa	well we don't no the situation of the pregnancy. was it planned, and will be a surprise?

Were you ovulating at the time (usually about 2 Weeks after ur period) and u can get pregnant a week within that time frame. Have you missed ur period yet? if u have buy a test at like 99 cents or dollar tree they are just as good and accurate as the expensive ones. if it hasn't been over a week since this happened u can still get a plan B (emergency contraceptive) to prevent pregnancy at a planned parenthood location for free even if ur under 18.

If you had a medical abortion which is you just taking a couple of pills then no.  With a suction or partial birth abortion the doctor uses the procedure called a D&C.  They dilate your cervix, and in your next pregnancy that can cause an incompetent cervix where you dilate too early in the pregnancy and lose the baby.  They also scrape the lining of your uterus to get all of the pregnancy tissue out, and that causes scar tissue to form on the inside of your uterus... this can prevent you from getting pregnant by preventing the embryo from implanting.  If you have any other questions, feel free to email me.  I wish you the best of luck!|`|EgRt4LMfaa	less than 1%--only if he damaged u--(if u had problems)  to ppl who havent---dont bother thumbs down-they tell u that there! suction etc is not a issue-they dialate u a tiny bit--if u have a kid u dilate to 10! doesnt mean u cant again (duh ppl-2 kids or more-) if the needle goes thru the wall and u get an infection it causes a 1% chance u will miss carry the first 2 years. dont talk about killing-no matter what its her life-her choice-her body--things happen-thats why they have options!|`|04a4824f734643fd0c6adefd032a1af8aa	if you had the heart to kill your son/daughter the first time you dont deserve to become pregnant a second time.

She has to be less than 8 weeks at the time she goes in or else she will have to have a surgical abortion. I don't think you can get them for free unless you are getting them using state funding which she can be applicable for if she doesn't have a job or insurance that covers abortions.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	you have to either go to our DR or go to the pharmacy|`|5JLGyaWUaa	You are horrible, you want to kill an inncoent life for YOUR mistake? i can t belive you!

And whether her health coverage covers that she would have to either contact them, Or go to her pharmacy where they have her insurance information and ask them if she would be covered, or what the difference is. I know they cost 350-650 (from planned parenthood) Because Ive looked up there website for others that have asked about it. The abortion pill isn't legal where I live in Canada. But she would have to get her doctor to prescribe it or go to your nearest Planned parenthood. However she may want to consult the pharmacy first in case she is covered!!! Other wise you are looking at the 350-650 Which yes is cheaper then a baby, and cheaper then a surgical abortion. And she would need to test to see if she actually is pregnant. She would ahve too be less then 8 weeks pregnant. meaning her last period would have to of been less then 8 weeks ago by the time she has it or else they wont give it too her and it woudlnt work either.    http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...|`|2GOtFHzBaa	uhh..don't...its MURDER|`|VhLnzDYgaa	well do you really want to kill an innocent baby  im 15 and i know if i have sex  im not gonna kill it  IT WAS HER MISTAKE  not the babys  so its like if i did something bad  and killed someone else  nott right. make her keep the baby. do the right thing.

TVC3mAP7aa	The important thing here is what day you ovulate.  Sperm can live in a perfect environment for 5-7 days, although 2-3 is more common.  If you ovulate within a few days after you had unprotected sex, then you will have a decent chance of getting pregnant.  To get a reliable answer on a test, you'll want to wait at least 10 days after you ovulate (or, in most women, 4 days before your expected period is due).

When you would pull out the sausage roll of old stale diapers, I would almost vomit, and definetly gag every time.  There was something about the combo of the wierd smelling insert, mixed with the dirty diapers that had sat in there for days that was gut wrenching.    The diaper champ was a little better, but still smelly.  The upside- I didn't have to drop $6 on a new insert ring every few weeks, it uses plain kitchen garbage bags.  Still stinky though, but it's the odor of the pee and poop sitting in the disposables.  I can let a dirty cloth diaper sit in my pail for 2 days and not even flinch.  If I didn't throw away the disposables right away, the smell was horrid.  I was sure cloth would be stinkier, but not in my experience.      I would say- skip the genie and get a garbage can with a hinged lid, or one that flips.  Cheaper in the long run as you're not wasting a ton of money for the inserts, and can be used as a garbage can after it's done its tour of duty as a diaper pail.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I have one and it works pretty good, all you have to do is spray some lysol in it for better results.|`|uFjvl4JSaa	I use that one for my main floor and the first diaper genie for the bedroom, I think they both work great and you never have to touch or smell the dirty diapers|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I'm really suprised at the answers you've gotten so far.  In my opinion, the Diaper Genie is worth every penny and then some!  We used a trash can with a hinged lid as some people suggested for the first couple months, but you have to dump the diapers twice a day or they just stink up the whole room.  With the diaper genie you don't smell anything!|`|oIFMohfUaa	A simple answer...NO.  I have, besides my own kids, over 30 nieces and nephews and 2 newborn grandbabies.  The many that tried the diaper genie's hated them...they didn't last long as far as larger diapers fitting, dealing with the expensive liners, and they don't hold the smell in.  On the other hand, several of them have found a different one, The Diaper Champ...it is much better.    It uses any trash bag that you buy, making it cheaper, you put the diaper in the center hole, flip the handle to the other side and it drops it through to the trash bag below.  The center part slide and keeps all odors inside!  WONDERFUL!      I wished they had the Diaper Champ when my kids were in diapers!|`|zPYyGw8oaa	No, Diaper genies are such a rip-off. We god the kind that takes regular tell kitchen bags and just opens and shuts like a regular trash...I think the brand name is Bright starts? look at babys-r-us, it is so worth it|`|AA10742362	dd is 4 months old, we have diaper genie and dont use it.  got a cheap trash barrel instead.  first few months u go thru sooo many diaper changes and the poop doesnt really stink...yet. its just easier to toss in can.  we'll c if we use later|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i just have the 2 and it works GREAT!! i love that thing; there is NO smell, ever and my gal is 8 mos and stinky!!we only put the poopies in there and the wet ones in a small trash can to save on refills; helps tremendously....
O4JuH8zmaa	It's called a pregnancy test. There are different types of pregnancy tests (urine and blood) and there are different brands (Clear Blue, Answer, etc.)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	umm it called a pregnancy test, not every medical thing has to have a weird name|`|IllWKAUGaa	hCG pregnancy hormone test strip...or just pregnancy test....|`|ZeNemqcMaa	lol a home pregnancy test (HPT)|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	A home pregnancy test.
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Out of those Names I like Sonia best..|`|VHHis05Naa	Miriam!|`|HurPmgSaaa	Chloe|`|y4Uliyq3aa	My Dog's name Is Sophie (Sofia)! But my own Child probably Khloe.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	tara  one of my good friends is named that.. i love the name|`|Elxuvon8aa	Well I am Sonja so I would not use that Chloe and Sophie are dogs in our family Sonja is derived from Sohpia Heidie was also a dog I would use Dawn with Annalivia as a first dawn second name|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Either Chloe or Miriam|`|DNygQdmVaa	Chloe.|`|2bZCgyGKaa	out of that list, definitely Chloe.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Out of your choices Chloe sounds the most "normal" to me so Thats what i would choose|`|34VXCyvVaa	Miriam.  Mira or Miri would be cute nicknames.|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	Sonia - i don't like this name at all! i definitely wouldn't use it  Tara - i like this name, its my neices name though so i probably wouldn't use it for my child  Chloe - it's okay, it was my cats name so i wouldn't use it  Sophie - it's okay, a little common though  Pippa - no, it reminds me of Pippy Longstocking!  Heidi - no, i don't like it  Alpha - no, too Alpha Male for a girl!  Misty - no, i don't like it at all!  Xanthe - no, again i just don't like it!  Dawn - it's not bad, maybe use it as a second name as it is quite pretty  Miriam - i actually love this name!!    Miriam gets my vote!  though i'd also consider Tara, Chloe and Sophie|`|cSOkd7Umaa	Chloe or Heidi|`|AA11490722	my sister's name is Miriam Louise, i've never met anybody else called Miriam before- so i guess it's a pretty unique name. She gets called Mimi or mim as a nickname.     I quite like the name tara    Sophie is my favourite on your list- so if i had to pick i'd have a daughter named Sophie Rose.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Well my name is Tara so I wouldn't name my daughter that, though it would be one of the ones I would consider out of the rest if it wasn't my name! I would probably name her Sophie or Chloe. I wouldn't name her any of the other ones, they aren't my taste!        :)|`|koXcq0l1aa	heidi|`|CeSsUpCRaa	Chloe Sophia sounds pretty.|`|lHKQdwsnaa	i like the name chloe, try spelling Khloe|`|DF6ihDDCaa	Tara  :)|`|iJPFGDGPaa	Sophie and Chloe are really popular right now for baby names.  I think you should go with something that means something to you, for any reason, and just go with it!|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Miriam|`|ebJ02QZJaa	Sonia I don't like at all.  Tara is okay, but reminds me of someone from school that I didn't like, so would be out for me.  LOL!  Chloe is cute, but not really a good name for an adult IMO.  Sophie/Sophia is actually pretty popular right nonw.  Pippa - no.  She would endure years of teasing and being called pee-pee or pimple or whatever else kids could come up with to be mean.  Heidi is okay.  Miriam sounds "old."      Of the ones listed, I'd probably go with Sophia and call her Sophie.|`|gl4DFLVGaa	No doubt about it, Chloe is my favorite!    2- Sophia (It's cute!)    The others I am not a big fan of but Tara is cute.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Sonia, sophie or heidi|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Sophie is gorgeous although I also like Chloe, Pippa and Heidi :)|`|igMh0iL3aa	Sophie, Heidi, or Tara|`|8wn7rQH4aa	The only name I like from the list is Sophie, so Sophie it is.|`|n4Ewusysaa	Tara
7ddc91e8d3da3e0943ee6549104f20d0aa	Ummmmmmmmm......what??|`|hMS2BUzIaa	Go see a doctor if you think you're pregnant... I sure hope to hell you're not though $%% ^%!!!  What's with the unprotected sex?  Are you married?  Are you insane?  Go get an education and experience before you make the life long most important "choice" of your life!!!!|`|a1ymHaWAaa	you may have started your period have you taken a test?|`|jNqf8HtDaa	i had alot of discharge and a little bleeding also but i turned out to be pregnant and if it helps i am also 19 haha but stay calm girl its the best thing you can do for yourself|`|VakYL5kCaa	craps?????    It could be just your period coming on. It could be implantation bleeding.  Best way to know is to do a test.|`|8AoGWNvnaa	Sounds like it's possibly implantation bleeding.  If you have more bleeding, it's probably your period.  If it stops completely, you're probably pregnant.  Sounds like time to take a pregnancy test...|`|VXG7fc8Laa	do a test.|`|JdyRdLwVaa	In my first pregnancy I actually had my period for my first 2 months I didn't miss my period until I was 12 weeks pregnant and a hpt finally came up positive.This time around I had some cramping and a lot of discharge And some red blood when i wiped once but then after that it was just old blood it was brown.I was almost 4 weeks pregnant then.
VakYL5kCaa	yes too soon to do a test. it could be implantation bleeding, it could just be old blood from your last period.|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	If you are halfway through your cycle, you would probably be ovulating now, and therefore would not already be pregnant. My GYN has told me about "breakthrough bleeding" if you are on the pill though, are you?    Some home pregnancy tests claim to show a positive up to 5 days before your period is due, however, they are most accurate after you're already late. Good luck.

PhkLLwVbaa	well my husband and I decided to start trying for our second child when our first was 1 1/2 and we got pregnant 2 months after we started trying it only took 2 months because I mapped out my ovulation days I went to google and put in free ovulation calenders. Its supposed to be easier and if you have already had a child together then you know that your stuff is compatible lol.Good luck and best wishes|`|MPc0kS1vaa	you are extremely fertile after birth.|`|AA10610460	I got pregnant with my second when my first was only 10 months old. I forgot to take a pill on vacation.  I got pregnant with my third 2 years later after getting norplant out I hated that form of birth control I gained alot of weight and got migraines.|`|AA10142346	I got preggers the second time around much quicker, I was off my birth control for 5 weeks and got pregnant. My first took 6 months. Everyone is different though.
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	All but the nosebleeds and dizzy spells. Just random times of the day,started at about 5-7 weeks or so.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I just started getting random nosebleeds about 2 weeks ago. I'm 38 weeks and 3 days now. It's from increased blood circulation and your arteries opening up to pump more blood. I get dizzy spells all the time as well, this also comes from circulation. It usually occurs in later pregnancy. 26 weeks +. It didn't really happen at any particular time, just randomly throughout the day. Best of luck!|`|DNygQdmVaa	No i never got any of that. sorry im no help :[|`|d35196945d1d19350f0b8c88b0531a6caa	With my last child I got nosebleeds. The first time it happened it freaked me out. I called my dr and he said everything was fine and not to worry. We checked me out completely at my next appointment, and everything was normal. If you have concerns you should call your dr.|`|ef42ST45aa	OHMYGOSH all the time! It's normal to have dry sinuses, which cause sinusitis and frequent nosebleeds. I think the nosebleeds didn't happen until I was closer to 5 months..  the headaches started as soon as I was off caffeine, and finally stopped at about 5 months! lol  for about 3 of 4 months I had constant migraines and dizzy spells. It would usually happen in the early to mid afternoon time. It wasn't too bad, but a little freaky until I figured out it was normal!  good luck.|`|HEOyvmYFaa	all the TIME!!!! its so annoying. i woke up with a nose bleed the other night. i use a little bit of Vick's and that seems to help my stuffy nose. and i get headaches none stop. im gonna talk to my doctor about it this Tuesday to see if there is a remedy
2HETgiwgaa	I know how you feel - suddenly when you're TTC AF becomes the enemy.  The problem is that most of the symptoms you get early on can be pregnancy or AF.  I would wait a few days, and then test again if no AF.   Good luck and baby dust to you.|`|75oU12V3aa	It sounds like I was when I fell pregnant.    I also had bad cramps the day before I had to test and told my husband I wasn't going to test because I know it would be a Bfn. He said I had to test anyway, a blood test and it was a BFP!     From 2 days after I conceived I was exhausted, had sore nipples, headaches, hungrier, etc. I also didn't bleed or spot.    So I'd say go do a qualitative blood test, as this determines the LEVEL of pregnancy hormone in your blood, not only a positive or negative.    Good luck!!!|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	You probably need to just stop stressing about getting pregnant. All you can do is wait and see if you are preggo, no one can tell you for sure online. And also (I have to add my two cents), I know you want a baby, but there are so many other things to life. Just try to enjoy life, baby will come when the time is right!|`|XZlBUaN3aa	You should wait a few days and test again. But it could be just your mind playin tricks on you. I've been ttc for 4 years and a year ago I was just so sure I was pregnant. I had cramps and craving and head aches and everything else. I even had BREAST MILK. And no pregnancy. I was so crushed and hurt but you gotta just keep tryin. Last month I had a 3 week period. So trust me I know how you feel. Good luck and lots of baby Dust
AA10610460	Trust me you are not alone. First of all I have "cliche" for you.... you don't need to meet girls, they are nothing but trouble right now in your life. You should worry more about making friends both male and female... here in is the best piece of advice, you ain't gonna meet anyone sittin up in the house honey. Get out, go for rides or walks, read things on bulletin boards and attend different things and find your nitch outside your education preference. You will be fine, experience life now or you will regret it later, there are plenty of kids that have a hard time socializin and they go to school with thousands of other kids. So count your blessings. You seem pretty open, good luck to you.|`|xZvzLztZaa	When you see a girl you want to talk to, and she doesn't look like she's with a boyfriend, just talk to her.    Don't try to be someone you're not, just be yourself. Don't try to be too funny but don't be dry either.    Just try to be charming and take your time.    Good luck,  Micah
3klIx1Egaa	well, you know your getting an epidural.. and if it worked like mine, you'll sleep till the babies head is almost on the table. The worst part of labour for me was when i was walking, before the epidural. Just remember it is only a temporary pain and once its done you have a beautiful baby :)|`|yfcJwQr8aa	first off, dont listen to anyones story about giving birth.  This will be a different experience, its only scary because you have never done it before.  Just relax, no need in getting worked up.  you will be fine|`|ejHfqSD1aa	I would go take some last minute classes. You will be fine. Good luck.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	try not to be scared you will have people who love you and people who are gonna care for you there, being scared when in labour caused problems for me (it might for you as everyone is different)  Just to let you know the epidural doesnt always work (i had it and didnt work) plus if you see the needle you proberly will say no (its longer than 5cm) also if you move or they stuff up you can be in a wheel chair for life.  Try and not have the epidural if you can, and just remember one the baby is born all the pain goes away and im not just saying that, it really does|`|7e9105250e216e6f1ae0dde9f25dd1c6aa	maybe you should take yoga classes or hire a massage guy and just relax.|`|54hVzylRaa	With the epidural you have no worries. My daughter had one and talked on the phone to friends right up until the baby was born. She didn't even know she was having contractions. You will be fine. Giving birth is nothing new, it has been going on since the very beginning. Enjoy the miracle that is about to take place.|`|qmslHwj3aa	Its really not as bad as people say it is.  I had my first on Oct 31/08.  I didnt take any drugs or anything and did not find it that painful.  Just get into the moment focus on the ending result( a beautiful baby)  Dont listen to horror stories people tell you.|`|4TDZxhV6aa	beat the crap out of your husband i know it's not the answer your looking for and sorry but thought it might make you laugh|`|pJ7icz0taa	Meditation...get a Cd and meditate..also ask your dr. if you can bring it into the delivery room ..if you do what it says on the tape it will make it so much easier.  just remember eveyone is different..you may have very little pain but you will have a beautiful baby and you will forget the pain once you hold her/him.   Good luck.|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	I wont lie but it does hurt but i just kept focused as much as i could and just think that you'll be holding that beautiful baby soon enough!    Good luck and congrads!|`|mKqfIgKtaa	I completly understand. I was so scared. But I can tell you that when the time comes you will woman up and just care for the life of something that will look like a sticky alien when it comes out......but you will be so excited and calm to see that sticky alien!|`|gvLjbVFJaa	Don't listen to everyones horror stories. People are more than likely to tell the worst aspect of labor than anything else.     In all honesty... it's not that bad. Seriously. Everyone freaks out, but it's not that bad. You just have to remember it's only one day out of your life. My labor and delivery wasn't bad at all. I used pain meds as well, but now looking back I'm not even sure if I really needed them in the first place, and I've always thought I had a low pain tolerance. I gave birth a month early, so I guess I never got to build up the anticipation like everyone else too.     Just remember... it's only one day out of your life, and in the end it will all be worth it, because you'll finally get to meet your baby. It will make the pain go away.|`|fdP9UJOsaa	Just think about how happy you'll be once everything is over. Seeing your beautiful baby for the first time, finally getting to touch him/her after all those kicking and moving around in your stomach.|`|MqFeJiukaa	education is the key search different sites, talk to your dr about what to expect the 12th and even go to the library and get a book or 2.  Congrats and good luck you will be fine.
Vad64Jjoaa	My daughter is 7 1/2 months old. I really don't measure how much of the cereal I give her I just put the same amount in a bowl each morning and mix it to the consistency the she likes (by the way it is usually a fruit flavored rice cereal). Then for lunch we have a Gerber's Stage 2 fruit or vegetable. Then for dinner we will have a Gerber's Stage 2 meat dinner (Chicken Noodle, Chicken and Rice, Turkey and Sweet Potatoes, ETC.). She is still drinking 30-36 oz. of formula a day and is very healthy.     BTW we aren't doing anything but baby food yet, she just broke her first 2 teeth on Jan. 31 so she cannot chew anything yet. I don't know if your little one has teeth or not yet, if your little one does that might give you more options to feed throughout the day.|`|AA12096768	My daughter turns 7 months today.  In the morning she has a 6 oz bottle plus some kind of pureed fruit & oatmeal cereal.  Another bottle before naptime.  After naptime another small bottle and a snack such as rise rusks or a bit of fruit in her self-feeder.  In the evening she has some kind of stage 2 dinner such as macaroni with vegetables and then before bed she has another snack of some sort and a bottle.|`|7Y3yhUtcaa	Lots of soft, fresh fruit: mostly bananas, melon, berries, peaches and nectarines in one of those "self-feeder" contraptions. I can't remember when I started things like o's cereal.  I like this site:    http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T030100...

If I had to pick; Leon.  Emeline is lovely and Laura is common but still nice.    x|`|KihffCc5aa	All are goregous and unique, question is, which one will you choose?  Will it be based on Yahoo! Answers strangers, or your own heart in choosing a name unique for YOUR baby, and given your cultural or ancestoral needs.  And, based on what the father of the baby wishes?    All of the names for a boy and girl you listed are beautiful.  Each has their own unique meaning.  Maybe, you'd do better following your heart, and if you are torn, waiting until you lay your eyes on your newborn.    Remember, you can always incoprate names.  Colin Calli.  Or, Emeline Leon.  Or, Gillian Locke.  Or, Paul Laura, as well.  You are the mom, you have that right, to create whatever name has the most meaning to you.  Your child has the right when s/he is 18 to legally change her name.

Hope that helped. Baby Dust to you!|`|qa4gjD52aa	Read What To Expect When Your Expecting by Heidi Murkkoff It's great it tells you everything from trying to conceive to after birth.|`|YqdU6SS6aa	I would definitely recommend Taking Charge of Your Fertility! IT is a great book, and you will learn so much from it! And it's great for every woman! Not just those trying to get pregnant!
HVWAq4u9aa	I would make her bedtime a little earlier each day (like 5 minute increments) that she doesn't get up the first time she's asked.  Not yelled at, but asked.  When she's going to bed at 5:00 in the evening, she'll figure maybe she better start going to sleep.  I also remember when I was little I shared a room with 2 of my sisters.  Sometimes when we weren't tired enough, we'd go in our room and end up playing and making a lot of noise.  So my mom would warn us a couple of times, and if it didn't stop, she'd make us come out of our rooms and clean something. Usually our least favorite chores.  After 5 minutes of cleaning, we swore we were tired.  After 20 or so minutes of cleaning, we actually were tired.  So I would suggest first having her do something active during the day (a sport, playing outside, taking a long walk with you) and if she's still not tired and won't go to bed, have her get back up do something not so fun.  Also, you could try offering her a reward for getting to sleep and up on time.  Go shopping with her and let her choose a new alarm clock.  Then tell her that if she can manage to get to bed and get up on her own for x amount of (consecutive) days, you'll let her have a sleepover or choose a friend and you'll take them both to the movies or the mall.  That could work.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Gradually her body will adjust to the new routine but it will take some time.  Just make her go to bed at the new bedtime every single night (including weekends).  Her body clock will soon adapt and she will start being tired and go to sleep at the new bedtime.  Just give it some time.|`|5HwgJHutaa	have you tried putting her into some kind of program,club,or an after school program... like gymnastics, dance lessons,karate...ballet..which ever..it would give her something to do,to keep busy by the time she gets home she'll probably go to sleep on her bedtime. hope it helps.|`|wZV2eaOmaa	I used to have trouble getting to sleep at that age as well.

Kl5kN2Qaaa	she could still be pregnant. from what i have researched each lab dectect pregnancy at different rates..for example some say that if your hcg level is over 10 you're pregnant others think your levels need to be higher than 5..i would suggest she do another blood test from another doctor and the light bleeding could be implantation bleeding which occurs in early pregnancy.as long as she doesnt have bad cramping she should be alright|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	is it at all passable that she got ovulation predictors by mistake? I have known of one person who did that when the ovulation test first came out she thought it was just a good deal on tests. also she should go to the er. I would say it was a lab mistake. tell her to tell the er dr that she is pregnant and that she thinks she is having a MC. Also not every one who bleeds is having a MC so the best you can do it o with her to the hospital and support her on whatever the dr says. She may need you the most right now.|`|75oU12V3aa	They could have swapped her blood in the lab, it doesn't only happen in the movies.    Tell her to insist on another blood test and a sonar to confirm the pregnancy or miscarriage, whatever the case may be. Then she can be certain and take things from there.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	There is a term called "Chemical Pregnancy" You get a positive before your period, your period arrives (which is actually a miscarriage) but you would have never known that because you normally take a test once you miss your period.

I also tend to answer with a mix of both depending on the question.  A lot of times I answer with my experience and then put a link to back it up.  For those saying that Y!A is not for putting links and such doesn't make sense - then why does it say "What's your source" every time you answer a question - it even prompts you to "Do a little research" and search for an answer.    That said, a totally copied and pasted answer without any personal experience typed can annoy me at times.  Although, I have learned a great deal from the other mommy's who do copy and paste medical studies and so on.  It has prompted me to do my own research as well.|`|CdodhnP5aa	experiences|`|NpSVEC2naa	i'd ask google if i wanted the 'facts'|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	It is very easy for a new mother to panic when a baby is crying.  Even with your 2nd child, there is always that slight chink of doubt.  At the moment, there is a case of meningitis going round my elder son's school, so I am scrutinising my child and baby, looking for the slightest symptom.    The thing is, sometimes, speaking to other mothers shows me that other people have done likewise.  Truly, I know that if it were something deathly serious, my instinct would kick in and I would not hesitate in bringing it to medical attention.    However, when you're tired, and you hear the horror stories, it's easy for your mind to work overtime and hearing from other women in similar situations just makes you realise that you need to take a chill pill and reboot!|`|723QHuicaa	Experience.    I dont even read the long copy and pasted answers. If I wanted to google a scientific study, I would. If I wanted a dr's opinion, Id call the dr.

OaOCcj8daa	The difference is that 4T is 4 toddlers and size 4 is a regular or boys" size 4.  Basically if you have a child that is taller than the standard "toddler" sizes are made, the regular sizes, without the "T", will have more length and more room in them.  My son wore all toddler sizes until he was done with size 4T, size 5T was fine in the waist but the length was questionable, so I tried a size 4 and they fit perfectly and so differently than the size 4T of 5t.  Once I discovered the regular sizes it was a whole new selection of clothing! Good luck!|`|4TNavgDuaa	4 is bigger|`|xL16bC3waa	As far as I am aware a 4t means that there is a little bit roomier throughout, and a 4 runs a little bit slimmer. I have a rather big 2 year old and this is something that I have noticed. She is about the size, round and tall as a 4 year old. She tends to fit in a 4t a lot better. She still has some baby fat left on her, remember she is only 2. This is best advice that I can give you.|`|olF9Hl6saa	In clothing sizes, a size 4 pant is made longer and slimmer than a 4T. The "T" (toddler sizes) and designed with extra room in the bottom, and more room in the waist to account for the "baby fat".    I'm not really sure about underpants. I'm assuming the 4 is larger, as they are designed for older children.
DuLhv7Ajaa	I think some people just aren't cut out to be parents and others are simply not mature enough yet to understand whats really important in life. I always wanted to be a mom because family IS what life is about. Money, cars, nice vacations, etc can't look you in the eye and say, "I love you".   My husband and I are always baffled by people who feel like we don't have enough alone time because of our kids. We love being with our kids, that's why we had them, to be a family.  Shes probably too immature to understand that her plans are childish and don't really make allot of sense.  My stats are:  32, married 10 years, 3 kids, and working on  4|`|dPmK83UYaa	I respect people who rather adopt than bring more children in the world. Although new babies and our own kids are Awesome, amazing, sweet, etc. I have 2 of my own. Sometimes it's very unselfish of a person to want to adopt a motherless child than create a new one.     Whoever she decided to adopt is exceptionally lucky because being not her own child it takes a little more work to fully incorporate them into your family and make it work out.     I give props to your friend for making that decision. Sometimes we think "oh I want a baby" but that is our own desire to HAVE that and HOLD it and WANT it and BE NEEDED...Yes some of us become unselfish giving up so much for our kids...but we get so much in return looking into a face so much like our own.    Adoption! It's awesome b/c we love that which is not ours but becomes ours through love.|`|lJ84gldxaa	Love kids.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	maybe she is not comfortable with her own kids or something.

But you never know what will happen!    I guess I just think of it as everyone has their once chance at life.  If they dont want kids or want to have them right away is their decision and I hope it makes them happy.    :) Good luck with you children and your future ones!|`|CiEdaoRgaa	having a kid is about readiness..  if you didint ready yet ...  dont do that...  or it will be a burden for your entire life..|`|a73330f80208a4411ffd38d3c2a07fd7aa	Hi there,    interesting question, but I don't think she's being selfish or insensitve...she could just as well say that you are being selfish by having 4 of your own kids, when the world is filled with unwanted children - you could have provided a home for 4 of them...    and again, she's in her early 20's...when I was there, I didn't even want kids, adopted or otherwise...she's barely started living yet, no wonder she doesn't want kids...but, things change, all of a sudden, those noisy, messy whingers start looking a little cuter and more endearing, and before you know it, mother nature has cranked up the hormones and you turn into a grinning idiot every time you see a baby...    We are trying for our first (I'm early 30's) and I'm glad I didn't start in my 20's, I did have a lot of things that I wanted to do with my life...and now I'm with a wonderful man and am at a point where I can afford to give my baby exactly what it needs, from an emotional and financial viewpoint.    at the end of the day, I say, whatever floats your boat - if you want your own kids, great, if you want to adopt, I really take my hat off to you, and if you never want kids, that's your choice too...    although I have to say, that woman who just gave birth to 8 kids, while aleady having 3 sets of twins at home, and being single and unemployed - she needs her head read!|`|60a7e3ffd573059c61c0954b767554aaaa	I have two boys. 13 months apart. I was a young mommy, married when I had both boys, but still a teen. Fast forward 10 years. I love my boys, but I can't tell you how much I push to wait until you are older. With that said, where is the line? What is the age when you are ready, and more able to properly raise a child? 25? 30? I can tell you that 30 is not so far away, and I'd like to have another (possibly a girl..haha) now that I understand what it really means to raise a child. I don't think that someone in their 50's could raise a child. It's selfish to try. That poor kid! Imagine what it will feel like for the kid when they are 16 and have almost 70 year old parents showing them off to prom! It's not fair, and they should consider a cat instead.|`|dNhgIMIPaa	I agree with you. I'm 24 and engaged and we have a 19 month old together. I used to think when I was younger I didn't want to have children and thought of adoption myself. Like I said I was YOUNG.  But the babies got to me, I had 4 nieces already and I watched my best friend have 2 out of the 5 kids she has now! I soon realized with everyone having babies, I wanted one.     Even though I was shocked and scared when I first found out I was pregnant, I was also so excited!   Even though pregnancy can be discomforting, I also loved it. I loved feeling my daughter move the most. It hurt sometimes, but it amazed me.  All the fears of being fat and having ugly stretchmarks went away as soon as I saw her beautiful face. Why wouldn't you want to have you own?! I love every minute of watching my daughter do new things each day.    The only reason I see people adopt is 1.They cannot have their own children , 2. they want a certain race child, or 3. They adopt out of poor countries or poor families unable to care for the child to have a better life, and 4.They do not want to disfigure their body.  Which is kinda selfish I think as well.    Unless she is unable to have kids, I don't really understand why she wants to adopt unless it's one of the 3 out of 4 I mentioned.    But adoption is great too! you never know, she may change her mind.|`|erH2EP4caa	It can be hard to understand the view that another person has, but it sounds like she is at least thinking about what would work for her.  She may be a better mother at 50 than many others would be at 20 or 30.      On the other hand - she might change her mind. She is giving you her view of her future, but that is only the snapshot that she has right now. I don't think you mentioned whether she is currently married or not. I am assuming that she is not.  Meeting the right person might change her views. Give her room to make that change.    I don't think it is selfish to plan the life that you want to have. A person who does that is less likely to have children that are not really wanted.  Unexpected pregnancies - especially if unwanted - are a much bigger problem. That is not to say that the person you are talking about is not selfish.  Maybe she is.  All the more reason to wait and plan.      There are places in this world for all kinds of people. This person may one day adopt a child who would otherwise never have a good future. Many of us would never make that kind of sacrifice - to assume responsibility for a child that we did not bear. Some people would not look at that as a sacrifice.  We all see things differently.    I think I am more like you, though older. I had my children later in life, mainly because I didn't meet the right person earlier. I have a good perspective, I think, because I have had a lot of experience with many situations.  I find that I don't judge as quickly as I once would have. I know that people speak what they feel at that moment, and that there can be much more to what they feel than they are willing to show. I also know that views change as experience grows.     I do not believe that this woman's attitude is indicative of today's generation being more selfish.  I hope that today's generation will plan when to have children. I hope that they will know that they can provide for them before they have them.  I am not suggesting that they wait for a situation that doesn't require hard work and sacrifice. But I think it is wrong to have children and expect to pay for them with welfare programs. Note that the operative word here is "expect."  Welfare programs are needed, but many people use them as a way of life.     In summary, try not to judge. While we can't imagine making the choice someone else makes, it might be the right thing for that person. And if the person is making the wrong choice, then that person needs our patience, understanding, and moral support.      I wish you the best with that 4th child!  I am envious.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Saying anyone who is capable of kids should have them and feel blessed just because some people can't have kids (or can't have kids easily) is absurd.  Some people are perfectly capable but decide to never have kids.  They aren't -always- a blessing.  Only if you want them.    Personally I could go either way.  Do I want kids?  Not really.  Will I agree to one (and only one) if my significant other wants one?  If he feels strongly enough about it, sure.  Do I think pregnancy is worth the end result?  No, I don't feel strong enough about having kids to think a potential nine months of hell (or death in the worse case scenario) is worth a newborn infant and all the unpleasantness of caring for one until they finally grow up a little (or at least sleep through the night--I am a career woman and I intend to stay that way).    I've though about it logically.  My conclusion is that I would like to adopt a male child around two years old from foster care.  Preferably a young child who had to be removed from his parents due to neglect or abuse.  There are many reasons for this.    I feel that bringing more children into an already overpopulated and quite messed up world is unnecessary.  I would prefer to give a child who has already been born but hasn't had the chance at a good home... a good home (thus why I prefer to child to have been an abuse/neglect case).  My reason for choosing a child who is young (but not a baby) is because if a child is older and a case of abuse and neglect there probably be more psychological issues.  I had to take into consideration that I would still be a first parent.  Jumping into adopting an older child with psychological issues without prior experience would be irresponsible and probably end badly for both the child and us.  I don't want to bite off more than I can chew.  The reason I would not choose to adopt an infant is because I have no desire to experience the sleepless nights (like I said--I have a career).  Not to mention, I do not want to make the waiting list even longer for those who are unable to have their own children.  The reason for wanting a male child is simple.  If my significant other wants children I will agree to one and only one.  That includes paying/caring for grandchildren of our under aged child.  If I choose a boy there is no chance of him getting pregnant.  Thus that issue is avoided completely.  Yes, I know he could still potentially get a girl pregnant.  But the biggest part of the burden/expense would be with the family of the girl--not us.  (Though our boy would most likely have to pay child support when he became a legal adult.)    Also, I would not adopt before I felt we were ready and fully capable of caring for our adoptee.  Both financially and emotionally.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	I love kids but in this time and age I personally feel that it is wrong to bring a child into the world as we know it today, because of all the crime in today's society, as far as other kids that are already here, there are a lot of children in today's society that need help, so I say adopt a child !|`|zDf186Xyaa	I think its good, dont you want Children who can talk about what a great parent you were? The legacy lives on.|`|8ndWUWxRaa	A few years ago I didnt think I would ever want kids. I remember being in public seeing, dirty, screaming, misbehaving children and stressed parents everywhere. But I was still young and in a selfish frame of mind. When you are just getting a taste of your own life you see all the opportunities for yourself and some see kids as taking away that life not enhancing it. In a few years if she meets the right person or settles down in a career and a home then maybe her views will change. Maybe they wont. But a 20 year old saying what they are going to do when they are 50 is like a 5 year old saying what they will do at 30. One can't forsee the future and how they will feel in 5 years not to mention 30 years. But it took a few years and Im due in 13 days and couldnt be happier. She just needs to grow up and see that life holds more than just herself. All an opinion of course|`|BA3y6MBlaa	Don't worry about your twenty something erroneously opiniated friend,   Please don't let her upset you.  She's talking out of her you know what.  She's so young and clueless that she actually doesn't deserve your getting so worked up.  But, between you and me, I love it that you are, in another time, we could probably be friends.    Anyway, I had my one and only child at 40.  Protection doesn't always work.  I really wanted children for the first 14 years of my marriage but kept getting put off, I finally resigned that I was too old and that this world was pretty messed up and life was a struggle of sorts, why bring another person to enter into this mess.  I got pregnant quite unexpectedly at 39, at 6 months pregnant 9/11 happened - I was upset on so many levels.  I felt I had been right, this world is crazy!  I have the sweetest most handsome and perfect child ever, a real treasure, ok he's a jerk sometimes and I have to reel him in....but he has a generous heart and a loving spirit.  I learn from him every day.  But, when I wrestle with him which he requires (my husband has muscular dystrophy fo0r the past two years and can't do much physically with him, unfortunately)   Anyway, I'm grunting and groaning.  And after 39 years of remote control and quiet time and professional focus, well that's all shot to heck...fortunately he never liked Barney, but your life is no longer your own.  At 50, I totally can't see it being comfortable for a Mom...she'd have to get bitter for missing out on her 50 years of habits and rituals.      Trust me, some bad boy will tame her long enough to marry her.  She's just being difficult to maybe get a rise out of you.  It happens.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	She needs sterilized. That's another Casey Anthony waiting to happen. "I, I, I, Me, Me, Me."    At least she's brave enough to admit that. Lets hope she's smart enough to be on birth control, force the boyfriend to use a condom and takes the morning after pill each time they have sex.    I don't think anyone should be forced to have kids, but I do think that if people feel like that they should get fixed.|`|AA11354548	if she didn't wanna take care of her own kids  and she wants to adopt i think its  really messed up.    congrats on your children and   upcoming new baby.|`|Heux22X5aa	23 married. Want kids one day. I'm willing to make the sacrifices like stretch marks, morning sickness, waking up early to feed/change them, take care of their booboos, help with homework, drive to soccer practice, etc. I mean life is not all about myself. I have love to share with other people, and I want to share love with my children one day.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	Some people just aren't cut out to have kids of their own ( me for example). Just because someone would rather raise an orphan than one of her own doesn't make her a bad person. If some mother has a kid and decides that they can't raise it because they are selfish or just can't take care of it and they give it up, doesn't that give her more insentive to do what she is thinking of doing? I think what she is thinking of doing kicks ***, more power to her!|`|sB9xp8wraa	"Anybody who wants kids is nuts."    What my Father said when he was angry with me.|`|L5IsUhacaa	I am 23, way to young and poor to start making copies of myself just yet. When I get the better job stability, I may start thinking about having children in some time in the future. I may also consider adoption as well, since I was adopted.|`|BPoZPvGoaa	For some one to say he/she would rather adopt a full grown child,than to bare one does not add up with me unless it is to provide comfort for someone otherwise could end up on the street or dead.    Or some one who biologically can not bare children and would like to take care of an orphan in there twilight years(financially, intellectually and mentally ready capable of providing a healthy family environment).    Otherwise, I think having your own children is the natural way to go provided we can take good care of them and see them through their early years to adulthood.    In my opinion, the women you are describing merely has a different mentality than you and although it might sound selfish at first but without knowing the real intent behind it, we should not be quick to judge or vice versa.      congrat on your 4th ! and cherish all those moment with your love one.  Before you know it, they will all be growing up and gone to college!
kaqPSgTVaa	No I haven't but intuition can be a pretty accurate thing. I really wanted a boy but kind of "knew" I was going to have a girl and I ended up having a girl. Trust your gut and see if you are right. :)|`|AwAw0uiKaa	Well obviously what people want you have has no grounds when it comes to nature. ;) And if you're dreaming of a daughter, don't necessarily think of it as prophecy, but keep it in the back of your mind and be aware of the possibility of a girl. :)|`|AA11763588	The first time I was pregnant I had a dream about my baby shower, and I got a pink stroller.    I never picked out a boy name, and never referred to my baby as a he. At my 16 week US the tech told me I was having a girl.    I never had a dream with my 2nd, or with this one.|`|StxCHnTkaa	With my first 2, I never thought about gender at all. They were both boys. With my 3rd, I kept dreaming about pink and having a daughter. Everyone told me that it was for sure a girl based on my dreams...my ultrasound revealed another boy! He's 10 mo now...and he's soooooo perfect! I was meant to be a mom to boys, and NO, I will not try again for a girl- lol!|`|jC1Mdsefaa	uhm..  coincidence if it did happen.  I always have dreams im having twins and Im pretty sure there is only one baby in there..  My daughters I would dream of them being boys!|`|xPfJG3FGaa	yes i had a dream i had a boy, he was about 4 in the dream, but it ended up being a boy!!!|`|IA6954NXaa	I had a dream I was having a girl and on my first ultrasound was told "Nope, your having a boy", So I just though well okay, it was just a dream! Then my next ultrasounds and every single one since they have said "Your carry a girl" I'm due in 2 days :) February 5, So i guess we will have to wait and see.  x|`|UUysEV0yaa	I had a dream that I had a little girl. i can still picture her face in that dream. She was beautiful.  I ended up giving birth to a baby boy- and he is just as beautiful if not more! Throughout the pregnancy though I was convinced that I was having a girl- whats that thing about a mothers instinct? haha|`|2irmTjQ3aa	No, I was sure I was having a girl and then found out it's a boy.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	yes i dreamed my ex fiancee that died made me a lovely white cot and it had pink sheets. it turns out im having a girl AND she is due on the Same day he died 2 yrs ago. 14th may :)   i believe she is like a gift from him in spirit|`|o7bYWjy7aa	i dreamt i was having a lil boy even his name 3 days after i found out i was pregnant i feel like his soul was delivered that day|`|0k7c35Hraa	you know something weird. my aunt has dreams like that about other people. she knows when a baby is coming, but wont know who it is. when my sister got pregnant, she didnt want anyone to know. my aunt kept dreaming bloody sick babies. when my sister had her baby, she was premature, sick, and just had a lot of problems. i think its very possible.|`|SKBbtFAJaa	Yes, when I first got pregnant I kept dreaming I was having a girl. I then found out I am.|`|BeNazR8Jaa	hmmm everytime i dream about a baby, it's always a boy. I dunno the sex of my baby yet...sometimes dreams are the complete opposite.|`|1ILYNExFaa	When I was pregnant I had several dreams about a baby girl with dark hair. When I had my daughter she was the cutest little girl with a full head of dark hair. Coincidence?  Who knows, I was just happy to have my cutie pie.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Yep!  But, in my dreams my babies would always be some kind of an animal.   With each child I had the same recurring dream for each child.  My oldest was always a female cat.  My second was always a female bird.  Weird I know.  I was also convinced that they were both boys!  So, I guess the dream thing was more accurate than my motherly intuition.  So, according to the dream theory,  you are having a girl!  Good luck|`|iMULlxdgaa	I do believe dreams can be powerful things.  they can also be meaningless as well.  A friend of mine actually saw her baby before he was born in a dream (shes a complately normal not even into anything oocult or mistic or whatever...she just reg. girl that had this dream and it came true) but then their are teh nonsense dreams ...or just you dream of things nd maybe people telling you they want a  boy will make you dream of a boy or hey maybe your just being rebellious and dreaming og  girl instead...lol It could be tho!
Bg6txvxqaa	I crave both at different times of the day and I'm pregnant with B/G twins! So I guess there may be some truth to it, but mainly I think cravings are your bodies way of telling you you are lacking in some vitamin or mineral so it gets you to eat it more!    I'm addicted to Chicken Tikka Masalas now with sweet mango chutney on the sided and lots of poppadoms lol it's sweet and sa\lty so I guess it satisfies my cravings!|`|f654abbec7984dc4c3a32a57138938a5aa	old people tell if u crave for sweets, its baby boy...and if salty or sour, its baby girl... rest only God knows...|`|C55pji5Qaa	I have heard salty for boys and sweet for girls. The first half of the pregnancy I craved salt but the last half all sweets. I never usued to like sweets before. BTW I am having two girls!|`|nFj30sZcaa	I crave a lot of vegetables. Weird, I know! And salty snacks like pretzels and popcorn. 22 weeks - It's a boy!  I usually looovveee chocolate and ice cream, but have no taste for it right now.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	i want more sweets, and i'm having a boy! especially pancakes (the syrup) and cearl, frosted flakes and apple jacks, made me want some just talking about it!|`|uhj76Fkpaa	when i was pregnant to my girls I only ate salty food while on my boy sweets!|`|lBrCM0TWaa	i craved salty foods for my girl
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    You may have concieved again darling.  you may have another baby inside im not sure its hard to say. but those levels mean pregnant for sure.  levels would have completely dropped to 0.    god bless x|`|JdyRdLwVaa	you are probably pregnant again.And the reason he may want to do another blood test in 72 hours is to see if your hcg levels are rising to see if you conceived again.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	I'd say that you should just go with what your doctor thinks. I had a "complete miscarriage" at 14 weeks and found out that I had been pregnant with triplets and my "complete miscarriage" was only one baby. I was still pregnant with two more. (Crazy, I know.) It could be that there is another baby that they didn't realize was there.  Just do what the doctor says and they may do another scan to find out if there really is another baby there.|`|8D6IbrcTaa	It's best to wait to retest you levels in 72hrs.  It sounds like you may be pregnant again.  IT wouldn't be your levels from your last pregnancy as they are too high.  You may be very early in you pregnancy.  After you miscarry you're very fertile so it's very easy to fall pregnant.  Best of luck.|`|x6IyESABaa	You could be pregnant again. Don't worry about the HGC levels. Different women have different levels. So your baby gestation age is around 2 weeks.     I had a miscarrige in last August at 7 weeks too. My blood test shows my level at 0. But one month later I was pregnant again. I did an ultrasound and there is a birth sac. Now I'm 26 weeks pregnant.     You can view my pregnancy blog at:  http://www.joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Well, whether you want to do this or not, it's coming. You have to do this. At first it might feel overwhelming, but eventually you get accustom to this.

In fact, I think most people can since most of the kids I've talked to in my 2.5 years of college seem to have the exact same feelings on the matter. It's hard accepting the fact that you're no longer a kid and have to move on with your life. You start to realize all the benefits that came with a being a kid and the downsides of adulthood (which you ironically probably never noticed before now). And perhaps the realization that you're now responsible for yourself scares the living **** out of you. However, you also need to realize that you can stop growing up and you can never return to being a kid again. You also need to realize that with the end of one phase of your life (childhood) a new one begins (early adulthood) that poses it's own new set of problems, responsibilities, experiences, and excitement.    The key is to not spend so much time wishing you could be a kid that you miss out on the rest of your life. You need to live in the present so that you can experience all the things that come with being a young adult because that stage of your life also only happens once, and once it's over you'll never be able to go back just like you can't go back to your childhood.    Young adulthood can be a really exciting time (if I can even reminisce on that part of life at just 21). As a kid you weren't really your own person. Your life was controlled by your parents, you had the same opinions on most things as your parents, and overall your life was probably focused on growing up "right". However, you're now at the stage of your life where you get to cast aside the shackles of your upbringing and decide for yourself just what kind of person you want to be. Now you'll start forming your own philosophies and opinions on various matters and on life in general. You get to start building your life, doing things that will lay the foundation for who you are when you're older.    I think you've started to realize that though, and from what it sounds like it scares you which is understandable. There are a lot of new responsibilities and decisions that come at you all at once, and the gravity of each is much greater than what you've had to deal with in the past. However, I wouldn't worry too much just yet. You're still young and while it seems like these things fly at you all at once you'll find that they come at a manageable pace. It's not like you're going to be cut off from your parents the second you hit 18, they'll still be there to help you out as you mature from a teen to an adult.    And I wouldn't worry about choosing a career. Most people have no idea whatsoever about what they want to do with their lives. The average college student changes their major 8 times before they graduate. The average adult will have changed their career entirely four times before they retire. Most people end up working careers that have nothing to do with what their major was in college. The truth about life is that you don't need to have your whole life planned out. It helps if you do, but it's hardly necessary to be successful or happy.    When it comes to work, both occupational and domestic, you'll learn that as you go along. Get a job now or in the summer to start getting some experience since it sounds like you've never had one (it doesn't need to be anything glamorous and it will probably be some crappy minimum wage job, but the experience is worth it nonetheless). As for housework like laundry, dishes, cooking, etc., you'll learn those skills quickly once you start living on your own.    I would think of these new responsibilities and choices not as problems but as opportunities. You get to decide everything for yourself now. If you wanted to you could literally just walk away from everything and wander the world for the rest of your life. The truth about life is that there is absolutely nothing stopping you from doing what you want to do except yourself. Sure, the consequences of various actions may be disproportionate in their benefit and detriment, but you always have a choice. Most people shy away from freedom, instead choosing to embrace safety. A rare few, however, decide to embrace their freedom and instead say "this is my existence and I'll do whatever I want with it". I suggest you do that. The only right or wrong decisions in life are those that you personally deem to be right or wrong, because in the end the only thing in the universe that can determine whether or not you had a good life is you.|`|V8xAbMiEaa	im 18, and a freshman in college.     dont worry your not alone, there are alot of people that feel the same way. im sitll doing junior college (high school, but you get to pick your hours), and i feel the same way. when it comes time, and you absolutely have to grow up it will be easier, because of your bf, and family. i dont have a gf, or anything, but i was still able to do it. im sure your bf, and family will let you lean on them:D|`|nbSp469Waa	Sweetie, nobody ever wants to grow up.  I'm 31 and still wish I could live with my parents.      Reality tho, yes you have more responsibilities, but, it is so much fun.  College is great, you will meet people that will become life long friends.  You don't have to choose a career yet, wait til your 2nd year in college before doing that.  And after college, you get to get married and have kids, if you want.  Having a family of your own one day, that is the best thing ever.  Then you will be saying, "I don't want my kids to grow up"  Don't think too much about the future, the future is scary and exciting.

I am also 17 and felt that way for a long time. go to your high school they should have a career center with people that can help if not look it up online.  as for paying bills and stuff a lot of schools off classes for living on your own because it is scary and hard.    your parents will always be there for you. your not being kicked out and forced to grow up. get another therapist. some one you like. because i know that helps a lot. talking out your problems in always a good thing.  you will do just fine.    good luck    ps. I'm in high school, have a job and I'm starting college while in high school to get the credit so i feel your pain with stress. it will work out. be organized it helps.|`|hoIH8dAlaa	You actually answer your own question.  So YOU already have your own answers, you just need a little help assimilating them.   1) Grow up, or be independent?  My mum is 75 and one of the youngest people I know.  She is very independent. (Independence is NOT your enemy)  2) Not used to chores, can't take responsibilities...  this is a recipe for disaster. You are the ONLY one responsible for YOU. It is unfair on anyone else to be responsible for you, they are not in your head or emotions 24/7. YOU are.   Cause and effect. This is your biggy!  3) Making choices on your own (stopping the dud therapist - great choice)      Feeling lost      Scared      Not confident      Depressed      Anxious  ...are esteem issues. Stop running all those negatives. I haven't heard you say what the POSITIVES are?? There will be..the more you focus on (+) the more you CAN DO!   4) Rejoice.. this is YOUR life.  Positive choices are yours. Baby steps. Train yourself with simple non-fail decisions, first...and DON"T 'beat yourself-up' if you fail. We learn from mistakes, it makes us grow. (see (+)  5) Seek help with a professional you CAN trust. Gain advice and strategies to overcome your fears, one bit at a time. Learn to love the whole you, not feel trapped in the moment.     You may have social dyspraxia? You may not to!   Things are overwhelming when you take them all on at once. Little steps AND REWARDS!!|`|1qTNn8qnaa	dont worry...just take each day as it comes...im exactly like that...dont wanna grow up and take responsibility...but itll eventually come to that...just enjoy the time u have now...even if u go to college u wont fully be alone and independent...ull have ur parents to help u out!|`|QQlbvWj4aa	This happened to me when I was 17, just a couple months before I graduated high school.  It's normal.  (I also have severe anxiety and OCD, so that probably made it worse.)  But it does happen to everyone.    But when I turned 18, suddenly everything seemed to fall into place.  I realized I don't need to choose a career and stick to it yet, I'm only 18!  I got a job, which gave me a lot of extra confidence, and decided I was ready, and even excited, to move out.    Just enjoy being young.  Learn.  Take a lot of different courses, and decide what you like best.  Move out with some friends so you'll have someone to talk to about your fears.  And remember, it's all perfectly normal.  We've all been there.  Part of me is still there.  I know some adults, 25, 30 years old, who still have these fears.    Good luck :)|`|VkvhtD4daa	dont be scared to grow up.
23875260903a212783bf842dafca84e2aa	There is a wonderful book called "A Marvelous Work and Wonder" that explains the very interesting truth about men and women. It explains on page 38 about how if a person comes on too strong to another person, the recipient pulls away. However, if the first person does a "toe dipper" or in other words just (metaphorically speaking) dips their toe into the water to get a reaction and see how the other person receives the hint, then PULLS AWAY or goes neutral, you will find you have begun to witness "the mating ritual", or the courting dance. Birds do it, cats do it, all animals do it. Try this. Drop a hint, then don't stay there. Log their reaction. You must initiate a response in a way that you want, or it isn't going to go in your favor anyway. The trick is to learn how to gain the right reaction. Unfortunately, this is a form of manipulation.....but everyone does it....it is just that some people admit it and some don't. Learn the mating ritual. Not how to have sex, but rather, the courting process that all mammals go through. And never reveal everything to someone who hasn't taken the same risk. Only reveal a little until they reveal a little. Back and forth, back and forth. If you can't get that process going, the other party isn't ready.|`|32fa257ac284e8b7416c5d07718d74c6aa	you tell em!|`|5e53982f30b91234ea9cdf88659c221eaa	people are cruel  dont let your guard down  watch your back    case solved|`|2ae567cb63afe36e16e1f314c11f68fcaa	I did not read your question. But all I can say is partner  1 reinforces partner  2 abuse (physical or emotional) if partner  1 allows it. But more over, if your feel love then you will accept anything from that partner. And even when partner  1 delivers the final deadly blow partner  2 will die loving him.|`|13303f36bea5402b05d45db613bcaac5aa	And your question here is....?|`|7d2fc69bb3b31a1fbb42a766647997d1aa	Uh . . . ok.|`|ef7626099a9a18c018b336224bc71d6baa	you go girl! dont let people judge you or tell you who you are. you know who you are. they dont. dont ever let anyone judge you. you are who you are and no one has the right to tell you who that is =]|`|a1e3a95979725dc25325fd2f07070249aa	i dont know what your questions was but i can see why you would be hurt. People can be cruel these days. remember that before you ask another question...just some friendly advice|`|9e9d7ff5bc39e67ac9e8bc802d53356daa	Your o.k., everyone goes threw emotions like that. You will eventually sort it all out. You are young, as you get older you will know how to deal with situations better. For now, trust your instincts. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. They don't call it growing pains for nothing.Just remember this to shall pass. Good luck.|`|fa215c58f4d00b581fd4b3930ce1ae99aa	I'm sorry for your hurt. I didn't read your previous question, but what I can glean from your new one is that someone treated you with disrespect, and was looking for something that you either didn't want, or weren't able to offer. Either way, you can learn that life is too short to waste time with that that isn't good for you, and the experiences that life has to offer will bolster your ability to determine which is which.  You might be confused, but you must also take responsiblity for your own feelings. Because, in the end, they are ONLY your feelings. What you do about how you feel actually IS your "fault", but I wouldn't use that word - I'd rather use the word "intention". Be honest with what you want in a person. That will clear your vision about fast-determining what a person may want in a relationship with you. If you feel secure in yourself, then you must also require that someone you get involved with is ALSO secure about themselves. Then, you move to the "intention" part, and things can go in opposite ways quickly then!|`|8ba6772411ce2fa9565b98ebe96d6a0aaa	wow.....calm down killer. maybe you shouldn't air you're dirty laundry on the internet if you are going to get so over emotional. take a big breath and realize that no-one can tell you how you should feel.|`|AA12302661	Okay.. i didnt pick that up.. Girls should be treated with respect no matter what happens..
hNJfnB4saa	I wear a comfortable "sleep nursing bra" UNDER a regular maternity/nursing bra for extra support and nipple coverage.  It's all cotton, and just sort of cris-crosses the fabric in the front.  Sorry I can't be more specific, as I don't remember where I bought them or the brand, and I ripped out the tags.  Basically they're like a little T-shirt for your boobs.  :-)    Every part of your body will change with pregnancy.  It gets easier as you get bigger, since it then becomes more obvious WHY you're expanding to everyone else!    I noticed the "always in the mood" problem too.  That's why pregnant girls should be married!  My poor husband was probably the only person on earth who would make a go of it, particularly when I was simutaneously weeping or yelling when I was trying to hit on him!  (cringe)  What a good guy, huh?  He made the effort, anyway    Pregnancy is always very, very distracting.  It is so difficult to do two jobs -one for pay, and one full-time job of gestating!    After 3 trips through pregnancy, I can promise you that you will get your body back.  It may be a little different, or permanently a size bigger, but it will be yours again and you can diet and have a beer and feel normal again!  After about 9 months- 1 year post-baby, the pounds will really start to drop away if you don't overeat.  This body is not yours right now, but that's OK.  You are well within your rights to wear an "I'm not fat, I'm Pregnant" t-shirt and to scowl at anyone who notices your new buxom look too obnoxiously.  I promise it will be worth it in the end.|`|bbZlt5J8aa	You could try putting bandaids on your nipples. *lol* That's what my grandma told me. If button ups don't work I would go for something you can wear with a small light cardigan over. Make sure your shoes are comfortable and not too high. Little black dresses work well. Good luck.|`|AA11107211	i don't understand your question or what are you worried about. Relax and enjoy your time. Not all women are blessed with what you are going through.|`|q4I46wyGaa	LOL!  I'm not laughing AT you but your poor hormones are ruling your life right now.  How far along are you?  Most of these things will settle with time.  For right now, you just have to be patient and make the best of it.  congrats on the baby!|`|8a406de12bcb3f873a4a578fdb7e86b5aa	You worry too much!  Just enjoy being pregnant  And go a size bigger in your clothes or find some maternity close that enhance the good points of your figure. Your body is gonna change and accept it you will get something so prescious and worth it in the end.  As far as complexion they have make up that you can use to help with that when need be....just look around for the right one.  Enjoy it time will fly though it feels like an eternity in the midst!|`|B2KHmACoaa	Cold Shower?|`|KWPcZ7mdaa	For makeup tips...what worked fo rme is the CoverGirl Tru Blend...i realyl like it. As for clothes, you can always go buy a pair or two or a skirt with an alastic waste, or something, or in a few sizes bigger until you can fit into maternity. Same with shirts...go buy some a few sizes larger. Because you may nto wear them long for now, but after you have the baby, while your uterus is shrinking and you'll be tryign to lose the weight those clothes may come in handy....as for the mind on sex 24/7, I'd say try adn think of thinks that would trun you off. If that doesnt work...take a bathroom break....lol...   :)|`|f7669f1b5c473b6b25a4fbee210cc603aa	Go ahead and get started with the materninty clothes. There are lots of dress clothes out there for pregnant working women. Have you tried a padded bra to help hide the nipple problem? If not then do so, or try a maternity one. They helped me alot the first time around with hiding the problem.. Being a horndog 24/7 does seem to be a problem for a working woman, but dont be embarassed by it. It is natural to go through this stage.. When you catch yourself heading in that direction try to concentrate on something else... If the people at your work know that you are pregnant then a little disraction is accepted.. I dont know what would cause your lips to swell after a passionate kiss that is something I would talk to the doctor about.. I wish you the best of luck, and Congratulate you on your pregnancy....|`|AA11045849	LOL sweetie i would be enjoying this instead of complaining! But i can understand the boobs getting in the way. You can buy what they call minimizer bras that may help with the abundance of cleavage. about the make up i cant help you since i don't wear it. But i imagine you can go to some department stores and get a consult there or from a Mary Kay rep. Good Luck!
MmGTFuoTaa	Hi mate. I just rang centrelink when i got home from hospital and answered all there questions and also provide them with the appropriate paperwork and i recieved the payment about a month after my son was born. It has nothing to do with your tax, unless your parnter and you earn over $150k a year. You also must know that you will not recieve the payment as a $5000 one off payment anymore, from january 2009 the payments have been changed to fortnighty payments for 6 months. So a little over 400 a fortnight. goodluck and take care xxx|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes forms need to be filled out and tkane to centrelink. Processed - Depends if your eligible you recieve it now.  its changed.  then its gets given to you in one big hit, or two payments or divided and given to you every 2 weeks : however you deciede.    godbless|`|xOr67VDiaa	My cousin just filed the forms when she was in hospital, hers took about 1 month to go thru..They use to pay it in a lump sum, but she said now they pay it out in 13 fortnightly payments.. i think its great, and about time the goverment made a good decision|`|KNcZTbqQaa	You have to fill out the forms but it is related to centrelink and I think it has something to do with your tax too which scared me ... way too confusing :(|`|6avKnzkoaa	http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/in...     Link to the site of centrelink.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	The hospital will give you a centrelink form that confirms the birth.  You will also register the birth with births deaths and marriages.  The hospital will give you a pack with everything in it and very clear instructions.      If you are young, they may pay you in instalments.  There is also a limit now based on your income.  If you earn over the threshold you will not get the bonus.
yOaGKfP2aa	Often times when there is a new baby, even children who are completely potty trained regress. It is their way of showing jealousy.     Let me think, my oldest was four when I had my second son, but my second son and youngest son are only two days short of 14 months apart. This did make potty training difficult. Orion was basically refusing to do it because his baby brother was still in diapers.     To combat that problem I did two things. One I gave him "big boy" attention. I would let him stay up a few minutes later than normal, gave him rewards like candies or pennies to put in his bank when he would use the potty, and two I gave him a "responsibility" to make him feel more grown up. Some parents frown upon it, but I sent my middle son after diapers when the baby needed to be changed and let him "help" (to see how gross it really is) when I changed him.     Giving him both the responsibility and the extra attention made him feel special, and grown up. When I started that, it took maybe a week to get him completely potty trained again.|`|LMc23g9Maa	I have been pretty patient with my boy, I read the books and they all say the child will indicate when he's ready.  Well, my child was more than 3 and did not indicate or say anything. We have had a potty in the house for one year but all he wanted was "put a nappy on"...  2 weeks ago, I quietly ran out of patience, stripped him to his undies (summer here by the way), showed him where the potty was and that was it. 2 accidents in 2 weeks but I can cope with that.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Although a lot of people say my kids potty trained at 2 or even younger. The truth is they don't tell you about the little slip-ups. The average for a boy is still 3 1/2 to 4. The average for a girl is still 2 1/2 to 3. So don't sweat the small stuff. When he's ready he'll do it.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Try this:  Make him clean out his dirty undies.  I was given this advise with my oldest.  She never had any accidents for the sitter, ever.  We would get her home and she would hide behind a rocker and poop her panties.  She stayed dry all night and that wasn't the problem.  So, Once I had her take off her dirty undies and wash them out in the toilet, she HATED IT!  Then I would make her take a bath to clean the mess off of her bottom and legs.  It only took 3 times of doing this and she was broke.  No more potty accidents at all.  It also sounds like he still wants to be the baby and is still adjusting to the new sibling.  Good luck and hope my tip works for you!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	He wants as much attention as the new baby is getting. And thinks if he's a baby still he will.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It took my daughter FOREVER, meaning just after she turned 4. Both of the doctors I saw during the time we were trying to get her to said to let her do it at her own pace. He will do it when he's ready. I know it's frustrating but some kids just take longer and pushing them doesn't work to well usually.     I know it sounds horrible but have you tried bribery? I did a sticker chart and promise of a piece of candy if my daughter went and she started going pretty quickly. Buy some stickers that have his favorite character or animal and use those. I only had to do that for about a month and just brushed her teeth a lot. Good luck sweetie.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	he looks for attention for sure!Keep telling him that he's a big boy and that he should be helping mom taking care of the baby instead of making her sad.He can go to pee by himself but he refuses to accept that you have a smaller baby to look after.Are you sure that he gain as much love and attention as he deserves?He may be 3 and you have a little one but he's still a small child and maybe he feels lost and unsecure.Try not to have different behaviour between your children and when he'll understand that mom still loves him a LOT he'll accept his new "big brother" role.Good luck
BQYXgtq7aa	Its a hard situation for all concerned, especially the parents as with a sick child its hard to give equal time to all children.   I think you should take Nicole out, just the two of you, and let her know that if she needs someone, you are there. Let her know that Jade needs their parents more at this time, and that her parents still love her. Help her to understand that Jade needs care, love and understanding and that Nicole could be a great friend and sister to Jade. Feeling frustrated with the attention her sister is getting is normal.   Nicole perhaps needs gentle teaching that life doesnt always go the way we hope but with family working together it will all be alright.  They both have to get used to each other, having been single children for years. It takes time, but hopefully in time to come they will be friends.     Help Nicole to understand she is not being forgotten or abandoned. Help her to see that Jade needs her more than ever and that they can have a special bond that their parents cant have with her. Also show her that you are her special friend, whom she can come to for anything and you will be there to help her and listen to her.    Be honest, yet gentle and simplify things as Nicole and Jade are both young. Talk to their parents and see if you can have Nicole spend time with you one day a week or fortnight or whatever. I bet the parents would appreciated a night out for just themselves too so maybe you can babysit for the 2 girls.     Good luck.
EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, I think it's pot luck really.  My first took 2 months of trying. My 2nd took 3 or 4 months and my 3rd took one time!  Some women are just naturally fertile, others not so fertile. Good luck and all the very best.|`|jQwYoRCXaa	I think that you are...but if you are going to try again wait a few months. I got pregnant very shortly after having my daughter and miscarried. it was really hard to deal with...i still cry about it and its been two years. i got pregnant with my son 2 months after miscarrying, i am expecting baby number three, and i was on birth control! i got pregnant this time when my son was 9 months old.|`|5da7df76a174be340d183f59300e11c9aa	Hell yes  three months after my first bam there was  2  i no ur more fertile directly after but i dont no about say a year down the road
5HwgJHutaa	First off, CONGRATULATIONS! well,I read baby books,baby name books, watched those tv shows about babies,labor and delivery shows went window shopping/shopping for baby stuff ,baby clothes...went to all my prenatal appt,went online to see how my baby looks http://www.pregnancy.org/fetaldevelopmen... my fav site and http://www.babyzone.com/...other than that...got a make over, went to the spa....hmm theres so much to do so little time. seeing my baby at 35weeks through the ultrasound smiling was the best!|`|AA10628838	I worked until two months before mine was due.

Just don't think about the time left and go about your life. The first 7 months flew by for me, and now, every hour is like a day. Take care of your self and that baby! Good luck.|`|efyp5CaRaa	I've kept myself busy with nursing school and work most the time. My first 2 trimesters seemed to breeze by. My now that I'm in my last it's definitely dragging because I'm so uncomfortable. When I'm not at work or school I shop, clean, ALOT of reading, getting the baby's room together takes up a lot of your time so does baby proofing the house. I also take a lot of naps when I have down time. haha. Just get out of the house when you can, staying active definitely makes go by a lot quicker! Congrats and Good luck with everything!|`|mKqfIgKtaa	I worked the first two months- THAT SUCKEd I had such horrible morning sickness  and then I went to school- which is pretty hard too.  Take up making stuff for the baby....it makes you feel good.  And I read every magazine and book and freaked out about stuff.  Please take note- there is a thing called afterbirth.   :) Congrats!|`|NNGOQLR5aa	I read a lot of novels.  My favorite author is Nickolas Sparks.  I also got into cross words, fill ins, and sudoku.

ggfE4rlvaa	That's a very interesting thought. Since babies inherit different traits from parents, they probably wouldn't. Such as: one set of twins the baby (or babies) could get the mom's nose and the dad's lips. The other could get the mom's lips and the dad's nose. Twin on Twin action though, they'd probably end up having twins themselves!|`|1CryEnb3aa	I would say yes.  They would look a lot a like.  I say this bc I am  a triplet and we are all ferternal and our kids all look like they could be siblings.  So, you get all those identicals together and have babies, chances are pretty good!  Just my thought.|`|NysFTExhaa	While they wouldn't look identical, they would genetically be like siblings even though they are cousins because both sets of parents would have the same genetics.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Similarities are possible,but being identical no. In order to be identical twins you must come from the same fertilized egg and that egg splits into two parts,thus two babies.|`|qmslHwj3aa	NO|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Yes there is a chance they could look identical but     at the same time they could be 100% different just has to wait and find out|`|bq9vsBoIaa	could be possible its all in the genes!!  my aunts are twins and im a twin(:
4EpXcNg4aa	Well sweety if you didn't use ANY protection then YES there is a possabilaty you could be. PLEASE use protection if you are going to continue to be sexualy active. Even if he is your boyfriend and you love each other. If he really cares he would have used a condom. There are a lot of diseases out there and you are still very young and naive.|`|rR5nIklWaa	dont listen to ur boyfreind  now u need to go get tested for stds  and  a pregnacy test  my sister was with this guy and he said he was a virgin  so they be alright having unprotected sex then she went to her doc to get tested and now  she has climitia  when she only had sex with that one guy one time  u need to use a condom|`|BvEGJ22taa	Of course there is a chance of getting pregnant by having unprotective sex, period. It's most likely too soon to tell and although you can get pregnant at ANY time, some times of the month are more unlikely (as in, ovulation; when your last period was, etc.)  I think 14 is definitely too young to be having sex (I know my opinion doesn't matter) but if you continue to be sexually active you need to tell your parents to get on BC.  Despite him pulling out,  there is still a chance of getting pregnant even if he doesn't ejaculate inside of you.|`|DNygQdmVaa	how am i suppose to know if you are?  could you be? yes.  But idn if you are or not.|`|zu7lHvCdaa	a lot of teens ask this question all the time and don't even know when they ovulate u can only get pregnant if ur ovulating which u can find out online also. Of course by having unprotected sex u increase ur chances of getting pregnant by like a hundred. there are lots of options and preventative measures u can take. condoms, birth control, plan b if u already had unprotected sex. its too late for plan b u can only take it up to a week after unprotected sex and even then its not for sure. if u miss ur period buy a test and find out if u r talk 2 ur parents just take it one day at a time and if ur not count ur blessing and use more caution in the future|`|ZAN6feeMaa	You've already asked this question...and you're a naive, passive little girl who needs to be spanked by your parents...who will BE disappointed.    You did the deed, now take accountability. You asked the question and I'm being direct without painting a false array of assurance.    Your parents might be angry and disappointed, but they will love you regardless (considering you have a non abusive, non psychotic family). Face the truth and you will be alright. If you avoid pregnancy, it may not be something you need to reveal, but you NEVER know if word still finds the ears of your ignorant parents.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	get an education before you start having sex,learn to spell it's pregnant not pregtant!! gee of course your parents will be mad if your pregnant they probably thought you'd be able to spell before you had kids of your own.  and yes it's bad if he didnt use a condom pregnancy is the least of your worries have you ever heard of std's??   i hope for your sake and your parents that your not pregnant obviously your way to immature to be having sex let alone having a baby.

You should be tracking your period and maybe taken ovulation tests  and having LOTS of sex while your ovulating.|`|DjTGPnkOaa	I have heard that geritol tonic helps...my sister drank it and was pregnant 3 weeks later.|`|CNFRrWhIaa	a new man|`|HmXViQipaa	Know when your ovulation days are...Have lots of intercourse on these days. Change your mind set "I'm trying to have a baby." You can try to hard..My cousin had this problem for two yrs..she said I just don't understand..we try and try. Well, finally they stopped trying and got pregnant out of no where. They were so consumed with trying to conceive they had forgotten each other and love making!    A friend of mine also had been trying to have a baby for a long time and just couldn't. Her OBGYN suggested her husband were condoms for a month..after a month have sex w/out..she did get pregnant.

fbqrIdkuaa	I don't think that it's natures way of saying that we have to many people, but I do think that there is a reason some people can't have kids naturally.    Before I get bashed...these are the people that used to adopt the children that were unwanted or taken from unfit parents.  It was a check and balance system.  Who loves these children now?|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	No. Because some people "naturally" have like 16 kids.|`|OxFV92hJaa	No, that's like saying people that need a gallbladder removed is natures way of saying there is enough fatty food in the world.    While it may be entirely true, it's not related....just the random cards dealt for various reasons.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	My brother says thats why but i dont know.|`|RzYePezkaa	no|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	nope|`|AA12344593	No I don't think so. I think it's just a personal issue dealing with each person and his/her/their whole fate.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	don';t you think that nature would keep those that are having children all over the world, who can't and or won't take care of them, from having the children?|`|VHHis05Naa	Ok, so your reasoning is that loving people who cannot bear their own children are just meant to suffer while murdering parents like that Casey Anthony creature or Kimberly Dawn Trenor can just have kids and kill them?|`|y4Uliyq3aa	No. Some people simply can't have Children.|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	Possibly. But I always wondered why loads of irresponsible, neglectful people can keep popping babies out, while so many people who have tried to build a beautiful life for a baby can't seem to have one. Did nature intend for that to happen?|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, because that makes no sense, to why some people have children and others don't|`|KNcZTbqQaa	No, I can't say that is what I think when I see people who are unable to have kids|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	No, because then nature would be saying that to parents as well.|`|DNygQdmVaa	idn ive never thought about it.|`|NkZNV9ROaa	We all wish that nature were selective enough that people who shouldn't have kids can't, but that's really not the reality.  There are many people out there who would make great parents who may not be able to, and many who can and probably shouldn't.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	That is a cruel thing to think.|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	No, I don't. There are people in this world that have several kids, and don't even care for them properly. Then, there are people out there that have so much love to give to a child and could provide for a child, and they can't seem to have one.|`|p07RwZK2aa	No. I don't think that's fair on the people who can't have kids.     I have always wanted kids so badly, that if I couldn't have them I would have had treatment or even adopted.
3OHzn5B0aa	it could very well be your baby moving...I started feeling my baby move at 15 weeks and it felt like very light tapping in my lower abdomen...you won't start to feel the baby on a regular basis until you are further along and don't worry if you don't feel your little one for even a few days at this point...he's  very tiny and still has lots of room in there.  I found that if I lay on my left side after eating or drinking something sweet or very cold he would start moving    congrats!|`|mrYCeWoMaa	i feel the same thing. i get little muscle spasms in my back, my sides, my rib cage, and sometimes it feels as though someone poked my belly. and if i rub my stomach it gets all hard and i get those spasms in my back again. So yes it is probably your baby moving. The baby is moving all the time, just it's not big enough for you to feel a lot of the time. Wait about a month or 2 and you should feel it all the time and harder.|`|9yeyzQi5aa	It could very well be your baby moving but the baby is still very young  sothat's is why it could feel like that..I am not sure about this at 14 weeks but i know around 18 weeks you can eat something sweet or drink something cold and then lie on your left side and you would be able to feel the baby move more...hope this helps at least a little bit..congrats|`|mKqfIgKtaa	When I first felt my daughter move- I was like three months and it felt kinda like butterflies.....I don't know if that helps but I questioned the feeling too to my doctor.|`|AA11820380	I also feel the poking in the tummy too. I think that's your muscles stretching. I feel it A LOT. It's very normal. Doesn't also feel like a ripping sensation?
VHHis05Naa	I think it would be emotionally devastating to your child.  My daughter cried for me when I left the house for an hour to get exercise.  I can't imagine the heartbreak your daughter would feel being left with strangers and not having Mommy or Daddy around.  And when she came back, YOU would be the strangers.  I'd never do this in a million years.  I had children so I could raise them, not someone else.|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Honestly I could never imagine being away from my Child that long. If you want to do that then go ahead.|`|DNygQdmVaa	a 6 month old may have stranger aniexity.  I could never be away from my child for that long...|`|fdnbXfvfaa	You would send your baby to people they don't know, then have them shipped back to parents they won't know?  Cruel thing to do to a child|`|NENNHNVPaa	While the custom isn't common in the states, I think the idea of wanting to keep your culture alive is an honorable thing.   Some customs need to be set aside (female castration for example).  However, the Chinese customs of family may be some that should be included in more cultures.      Do what you and your spouse feel comfortable with.   If a year seems too long then maybe just 6 months?    As far as it being traumatic or emotionally scarring?   Why would it?  Aren't you going to continue to maintain contact during the time she is with your in-laws?  It's not like she going to forget you.  And you plan on continuing the education your in-laws start aren't you?  So it's not like they are going to get cut out of her life when she gets back.    My youngest is now 18.   If I had had this type of chance for my child when they were young, I would have gladly taken it and thanked my parents or in-laws for their offer.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Uhm, the baby needs you.  I think that you should be responsible for teaching her, or all of you take a vacation.  Not like she will remember china anyway from 6m to 1 1/2 it would be pointless    My auntie was adopted from over there, and she is scarred from her mom abandoning her! so your baby may miss you so much that it will emotionally scar her.     But do what you think is right, and talk to a pedi first and get all the medical benifits and downfalls|`|lGrcLQ49aa	I know a Chinese couple that sent there children to live with the mother's parents when they were between 6 mth and a year but I think it would be really scary for a child since that is about the age that they get stranger anxiety not to mention the fact that as a mother I don't think I could do it.      whatever you choose many blessings.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	I think this would be horrible for the child, by 6 months the child knows who its parents are and would be extremely upset by just being taken away.    Then in a year when you take her back it would be upsetting and confusing again as she would now feel a close parental bond with her grand parents and not with her parents.    I know a girl whos children were taken away from her and she sees them only once a month and the two younger ones aged 2 1/2 and 9 months dont have any bond with there mother at all (they have been living with there grandmother for 6 months).    If you really want her to spend a year in china maybe you should go over there with her for the year|`|jQwYoRCXaa	when my daughter was 3 months she went and stayed with my grandparents for 2 weeks while i packed, moved and unpacked. when she came home she acted like she didnt even know me and she looked sooooooo different! she is two and i still feel like i missed out on a lot, even tho it was two weeks. since then i have had a hard time even letting her spend the night with someone...i guess with me it might be a guilt thing, idk. if you feel like you can handle it go for it, its not like you cant change your mind and go get her.|`|8sPS24cmaa	I could never give away my child for 6 months|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I am going to be culturally open minded as you say....I understand your wanting her to learn Chinese and about her family history...but, sending your child at that age, away for a year would not be good for you or her...you need to be together...this is an important time in her developemnt.  Is there some way you can get your parents to leave china for a year and stay with you or can't you, yourself teach your child Chinese?
rh9CRcXraa	I say if that's what you and your husband want  then go for it!! and who cares what other people think,, I mean really,, it's your life,,not theirs. It's up to you and your husband to decide when enough is enough,,not anyone else.  And congratulations on your newest family member!!|`|MqFeJiukaa	no as long as you can financially and emotionally support them then I think its great.  I am having my 5th due the 27th but this is it for us.  I have decided on a tubal.

But do not forget this world is getting worse and worse to bring someone in this hell hole.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with wanting a large family. Every parent and family is different. Some parents seriously could not handle six or seven kids, others do great at it. My husband came from a family of 6 and my dad from a family of 9. You choose between you and your husband how many children you want and don't let others influence that number by telling you to 'stop the train'.   Congratulations and God Bless!    PS I kind of want a large family, too.|`|yJXX9kLqaa	As long as you can afford six kids (and treat them great) then go for it and don't listen to anyone else.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	i've not long turned 23 and i'm pregnant with my fifth, ages 5 1/2, almost4,2,11months and due in april with number 5.

Ages 10, 8, 4, 3, 18 months and trying for the 6th! Having some problems this time getting pregnant, but we will keep trying.  There is no problem with a big family as long as you can handle it. Yes, it gets hectic at times, but I would not trade it for anything! GOOD LUCK!|`|P8VoBR0saa	theres nothing wrong with it, i'm 23 and i have 3 and we want 3-4 more, we would like to adopt atleast one but if you can handle them and afford them go for it!!|`|436fREgIaa	Nothing wrong with it,as long as you can be a great parent and can afford it now, and as the child grows..nothing wrong with big families at all.the only reason a lot of people only have a couple,is because its instilled in thier brains to only have 1 of each.more power to ya! :)|`|6fjMtWboaa	It's totally up to you.  If you can handle it and can afford it great!  If you're living off the gov't and popping out babies, shame on you.|`|AA11371251	no I'm one of 6 kids. I wouldn't do that to myself but if you can handle it then go for it|`|BN5nW4rZaa	In my opinion there is nothing wrong with having a large number of kids....well as long as you can afford them.
mhxZWtSFaa	it's normal we (guys) are curious about those things, i asked the same to my gf and she freaked out too!! lol|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	I don't understand the appeal, but I guess it's a lot more natural than drinking cow or goats milk -  they are the wrong species after all. Apparenly Pete Wentz tasted his wife Ashlee Simpson's milk while she was pregnant. He said it tasted "soury" and "weird." If your boyfriend is curious you may as well let him try it. lol :-)|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Let him try it--he will change his mind real quick lol|`|qxnZXOVFaa	it's not uncommon.  i've known a few men that tried their wife's breast milk!|`|AA11371251	I think every guy who has had a pregnant girlfriend/wife has given it a try. I asked my husband if he would try mine when I'm pregnant and he said his friend tried his wife's but didn't like it haha! So let you boyfriend try it he probably won't like it and won't ask again!|`|wFVLP5l3aa	lol my partner hates it he dosnt even like cuddling me sometimes cause hes afraid ittel leak on him    but he accidently drank some of his mothers that was in the fridge when he was younger so thats prob y lol|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	Im a guy and I want to do this at some point with my wife lol, not sure why though.

Have you tasted it?  He is just curious.|`|AA10458750	Lol...I don't have milk, the colostrum leaks out and he says he likes that. Guys r strange.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Lots of guys want to.  I have no idea why.  But let him :-)  My husband tasted mine, lol    guys are pervs haha|`|hqJbghUUaa	let him and he will over with his fantasy|`|F5gtYbDVaa	it feels SO GOOD :o|`|8sPS24cmaa	let him, if your ok with it.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Let him taste it.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	i think that's gross but whatever floats your boat i guess|`|5d1b54e3efed93f0e4984edefdd98aa7aa	all is lawfull but not expedient|`|O1lm79EFaa	Lol crazy let him try it. My bf said the same thing to me before.|`|DgTZc7UQaa	if your ok with it i dont see why not, unless your baby is already here then i would save it for the baby, but if your grossed out by it then tell him no, there is milk in the fridge|`|5HwgJHutaa	as long as you are comfortable with it...theres no harm...go for it,but if your not comfortable then too bad for him. he'll just have to deal. lol|`|AA11837575	its ok but nasty|`|eV7rtxmuaa	My partner use to drink babys left over milk if i expressed it. Haha. I thought it was a little gross but I guess there are just curious.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	Men are curious. There's no harm in that.   Plus, Breastmilk tastes a whole lot better than that formula crap!|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	This is normal. Do you not want to know what your baby is drinking and how it taste? So let him no big deal.|`|2GMdTj3aaa	let him have a lick|`|pFDu5I3Uaa	kinda strange...  but funny.    give him a taste..bet he wont ask again! =-P|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	If I were you I'd have fun with it.  Let him taste.  It wont get all used up with one taste for him and heck, if it gets you giggling and turns him on it can't be all bad right?

3OHzn5B0aa	unfortunatly tylenol is the only safe med to take. I'm 31 weeks and have had many toothaches during this pregnancy...make sure you are getting at least 200mg of calcium a day which is usually standard in most prenatal vitimins.|`|1CryEnb3aa	About all you can take for pain is Tylenol.  Have you tried ambosol gel for your tooth?  This will ease the pain and let you get some rest.  Good luck!|`|kjOsSmM0aa	Ambesol is probably fine because you're not putting it into your system. But you really should go to the dentist. You may have an abscess tooth and then it would be better for the baby to get on antibiotics and probably get the tooth pulled. See a dentist... but tell him that you're pregnant. Just so they know.|`|QAGhFzFsaa	Ok this is gross..... but ..... crush up a Tylenol and rub it on your gum where it hurts... it works much faster then actually taking the medicine, but tastes so nasty! Good luck... call the dentist first thing in the morning, but I had HORRIBLE tooth aches all during my pregnancy and my dentist kept telling me... "that happens during pregnancy!"

Parker - unisex but orginally a boy's name (I have only hear of boy's with it)  Jayden - boy only  Gracen / Greyson - I have never seen these spellings before but I think of it as more of a boy's name  Maycen / Mason - boy only ( I have never seen that first spelling)  Addison - boy's name ( but it is very popular as a girl's name) but it should just be for boys  Madison - both girl and boy name (I think of it as more of a girl's name though)  Teagan - made up name, so neither  Keagan - made up spelling (it should be Keegan) which is a boy's name  Reagan - made up spelling (it is just Regan) which is a girl's name  Cyan - made up name (never even heard of it) so neither  Ryan - boy's name (but I have met one girl with the name)  Bryce - boy's name   Peyton - boy's name (but it is getting more popular for girls)  Cameron - boy's name (but I have heard it for both)  Avery - both girl and boy name (I have heard both) but it is equally as much a boy's name as it is a girl's name  Alexis - both a girl and boy name but originally a boy's name (I have only heard of it for girls though)  Riley - boy's name (but I know one girl named Riley - she may spell it differently though)  Taylor - equally girl and boy name (but I think it is pretty girly now)  Bailey  - equally girl and boy name (originally a last name)  Campbell - boy's name only  Casey - equally girl and boy name (but primarily girl now)  Dakota - equally girl and boy name (it is a place name so it is neither feminine or masculine) I do think of it as a bit more girly though  Dylan - boy's name only  Emmerson - made up spelling (it is spelled Emerson) and it is a boy's name  Jamie - equally boy and girl name (the feminine form of James as well as the Scottish variation of James) - just the name Jamie is feminine but Jamie as a nickname of James is definitely heard of for a boy  Reese - made up spelling (it is spelled Reece or Rhys) and is a boy's name but I have heard it used for both    And from this list I like Ryan, Riley, and Dylan but for boy's only.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Parker - Boy  Jayden - Boy  Gracen / Greyson - Boy  Maycen / Mason - Boy  Addison - Girl  Madison - Girl  Teagan - Girl  Keagan - Girl  Reagan - Girl  Cyan - Boy  Ryan - Boy  Bryce - Boy  Peyton - Boy (but Payton would be a girl)  Cameron - Boy  Avery - Either  Alexis - Girl  Riley - Either  Taylor - Girl  Bailey - Girl  Campbell - Boy  Casey - Either, but more for a boy  Dakota - Boy  Dylan - Boy  Emmerson - Boy  Jamie - Either  Reese - Boy    Ryan is my favorite.|`|KcfBOa9vaa	Parker - can go either way but I prefer it for a girl  Jayden - boy  Gracen / Greyson - boy  Maycen / Mason - can go either way but I prefer it for a girl  Addison - girl  Madison - girl  Teagan - DEFINITELY girl  Keagan - boy  Reagan - girl  Cyan - boy  Ryan - spelled like that: boy. but if it's Ryann or Ryanne then girl  Bryce - boy  Peyton - spelled like that: girl. but if it's Payton then boy  Cameron - boy spelled like that. girl spelled Kamryn  Avery - boy  Alexis - GIRL  Riley - boy  Taylor - girl  Bailey - GIRL  Campbell - BOY  Casey - either  Dakota - boy  Dylan - BOY  Emerson - boy  Jamie - girl  Reese - boy    Ryann, Kamryn and Parker are my favorites for girls and Reese, Emerson and Avery for boys.    Good luck!|`|Coi21Fhcaa	madison|`|q0QYDtH7aa	Taylor|`|69GgJhnWaa	If it's unisex there is no specific gender attached to the name, thus it cannot be a 'boys or girls' name. Also, Madison, Teagan, Alexis and Dakota are not unisex names, they are female names. And I don't like Campbell.

Cu8svhwAaa	Do an online search for a due date calculator and enter in your last period date and it will show you about when you are due and when you conceived. Congratulations!|`|QAGhFzFsaa	It really depends on your body and your normal hormone levels! But congrats!!!|`|x6IyESABaa	Should be about 6 weeks but It really depends. Different women have different levels. Most accurate will be via ultrasound. They can estimate from the size of the birth sac.    You can view my pregnancy blog at:  http://www.joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/|`|sbfm5rCAaa	Unfortunately you cannot tell exclusively from hormone levels as every women produces different amounts in her first trimester.    I would say you are around 6 weeks but the best way to tell is to have an ultrasound. They are quite accurate in the early stages of pregnancy and should be able to see how big the fetus is.    Sorry I can't be of more help but best of luck to you.
gvLjbVFJaa	Dont' get me wrong, I love animals (I'm a vegetarian) but your health and the health of your unborn child is more important than your pets, so of course you should get rid of your cats.     No offense, but it sounds like they are dirty and your baby should NOT be in a house that is full of infectious germs. Sounds like you need to be on top of things and not keep your house filthy so they don't continue on getting re-infected. Also, If you live alone who is taking care of the litter box? It needs to be done on a regular basis (EVERYDAY) if you are pregnant by someone other than YOU. You aren't supposed to be around a litter box to begin with.    Get rid of the cats, clean up your house, and think about your unborn childs health. You'd be totally selfish, if you didn't.     Post an ad on craigslist and find them a home. If not, go in front a grocery store or something.|`|eDnWMm3maa	I would find a good home for them. A farm, a friend, anything. I have two cats, but I'm not pregnant.    Anytime you have more than one animal in the house, you run the risk of worms or various flea/mite type things. If they are EVER allowed outside, it's pretty much a guarantee they will come home with something. Things like fleas and mites are species specific. They won't spread to you. I've never heard of a person getting worms from their cat.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Oh my!  I dont exactly know what to say.  I would just keep them locked in that room.  It may be a little devestating at first, but once all of you are "fixed" everything will be okay!  I would definently NOT put them to sleep.  That is the worst thing to do.  I pray you all will be okay, and the belly baby!    Im sorry!  Babe cleans my kitty box.    another thing is EVERYTIME you do anything with the cats ALWAYS wear some kind of gloves to protect yourself, and also change the litter box outside.  and use sanitizer on everything..    I worked at a vet clinic until I was 6 months along, they never knew I was pregnant, but I did this also!  I didnt get sick at all.    Good luck!|`|Cu8svhwAaa	Wow. I'm not sure.  Maybe you should put them down?  I know it's harsh but in the long run you might lose  your baby as well.|`|foMaAyTWaa	It's usually only the litter that infects you (handling feces) so if you hire a maid to clean the litter box out and do general cleaning for you, you can keep the cats.|`|x6IyESABaa	Why don't you confine them to one area? You can get a cage for that. They do sell cages for cats.     I have 2 dogs. One is infected with mange. I kept him confine in the kitchen. My sister in law helps me to bathe him regularly.|`|eiWy4RiJaa	I agree with MAMA TWOM|`|a1ymHaWAaa	i would see if someone could take em for you till you have baby.|`|VUss5AfAaa	put a some flyers up on the pet stores ( free loving cats  need a home)and then your info and everything hopefully that way you could be sure they will take them in.  but make sure you ask the stores first (petco,petsmart)|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Yes i think you should get rid of your cats. It sounds like 3 cats and a pregnancy is just to much for one person to handle. Talk to your local shelter ( i am sure if they knew the problem they would be more likely to help) or your vet clinic could possibly help you sent up an adoption (I have adopted cats from a vet clinic before.) Good luck on your testing

M1gL4Jd6aa	Well you could be!  I remember feeling terribly crampy and I nearly fainted at 5 weeks pregnant and then the vomiting started at 6 weeks pregnant.  So you could be, but do take a pregnancy test to make sure!!  You can take one from the day after your missed period and if it is negative, take one again in a weeks time.  Good luck!|`|kjOsSmM0aa	You could be pregnant. Have you taken a test? If it is positive and you are passing out (literally) then go to a doctor to find out why. If a test is positive and you have a lot of severe cramps, then I would also have that checked out. Any department store has pregnancy tests for $4 or $5. It's worth it to know.   Just so you know, though, the test will not come up positive (even if you are) until the morning of your first missed period. So if you haven't missed a period yet, just probably wait.
spuz7DvNaa	Why would you need that? The problem with kids now is that they are not punished.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	pardon me?
fbqrIdkuaa	To take the time to see and enjoy the little things.  It is amazing how the little things effect our life and so many people ignore them or don't see them as important.    My children don't care if we bought a new car or that they just got new clothes, but my son is still talking about the indoor picnic we had a few weeks ago and my teenage daughter even admits to friends that she loves that we go out to breakfast every other weekend (just her and I).

VhLnzDYgaa	my sister had a premee    3 pounds 10 ounces    and she had an epidural  and she said it hurt  but i imagie not as much as full term|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My son came at 31 weeks and was 3lbs 11oz and I still had to be cut. When they are that small you don't always get the over whelming urge to push like you would with a full term baby. I would have a contraction and it felt more like I had to pee really bad and couldn't, than the pressure in my bum they kept talking about. Because of this I wasn't pushing as hard as I was supposed to be and he got STUCK! 3lbs and he gets stuck?!  My contractions didn't hurt as bad as I thought they were going to, I could mostly breathe them out (and tell them to go away, lol) until I hit 8cm and I had an epidural. The anesthesiologist said it was going to feel like a bee sting. I'm not sure what kind of bee she was talking about, but that was the biggest damn bee sting I have ever felt, lol. I was very cold and very itchy after wards and very numb. The doctor kept telling me "push where my fingers are!" And I kept saying "WHAT EFFING FINGERS?! I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING!"    But no, I doubt very much that it would have hurt pushing him out as much as it would have a full term baby. His head was no where near as big as a full term babies would be. (his head was about the size of a large orange)    Good luck and congrats~|`|nhhCow4haa	my son was 8lb 10oz when he was born, he was only 2 days late. I had only the gas as pain relief which i didnt think did too much at all, so i pretty much had nothing. The pain wasnt too bad, i found the contractions worse than pushing|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Take out your ruler. Measure 10 centimeters.  That is how far your body will need to diailate the cervix for the baby to push its head and shoulders through.    Given the head circumferance and weight of the baby's body, if the child is anywhere close to full term, your body is going to need to open that wide, stretching far enough to get the baby through.    Yes.  It is going to hurt.   But, also the muscles of the belly are the ones doing the pushing (the way you push toothpaste out of the tube) and they are going to push so hard that they hurt - and your back muscles...    Believe me, you would not want your own child to be coming into the world as a premature baby.   There are too many longterm health risks associated that your child may have to live with all their life.  Whatever it takes.   Do all you can to keep your baby in until that 38th-39th-40th week.   Your child is worth any discomfort.|`|eXaI4xnsaa	my sister had a preemie and she went through so much after the baby was born not her but the baby he was in the hospital for 3months plus had surgery on his heart...i had a 12 pound baby and i would say THE SMALLER THE BABY THE LESS PAIN COMING OUT AND THE BIGGER THE BABY THE MORE PAINFUL IT IS during and after delivery but its way worth it to have a healthy baby    i hope you dont have a preemie it was worth having a big healthy baby then to go through having a preemie that is at risk of survival...my nephew is a survivor and is now 6 months now but was born at 25week only 2 pounds GOD BLESSED preemies|`|OgzHcNMsaa	I had my baby at 37 and a half weeks and she weighed 5 lbs, 9oz. I found the contractions way more painful than the pushing. I had no drugs at all. Because I found the contractions the most painful part, it wouldn't have mattered if my baby was 5 lbs or 12 lbs. The pushing part for me took 10 mins and she was born. I say regardless of size, try to do it natural  for as long as you can tolerate the pain and if you can't, then ask for an epidural. You might find that you didn't need it after all...Good luck.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	my son was premiee and didn't hurt too much, it was mainly just pressure not pain.  he was 7lb 1oz (3.21kg) which is average weight for newborn so i'm very thankful he decided to come early instead of going full term!! lol|`|gvLjbVFJaa	I don't know about giving birth to a full term baby, since I gave birth at 36 weeks  (she weighed 5 lbs 6 oz) and I had no major problems with my delivery. I still took the epidural because I anticipated a lot of pain, but now looking back the pain wasn't that bad at all and probably would have done without it. If anything, the pressure was more painful than anything else.|`|ly0DDAvaaa	honestly i dont think the size really matters, its the fact that your being streched and some babys birth weight is about 6-7lbs but the weight isn't what u need  to worry about its the head size.|`|bRTg7ahxaa	I don't have any personal experience with this, but my friend had her baby when she was only 26 wks along. He was about 3lbs, and she said that she didn't even feel it when she pushed him out. She did not have an epidural.|`|1I4amj99aa	Hi, I had a 7 lbs 2 oz. baby and a 5 lbs 12 oz baby (the first 2 weeks early and the second 1 week early) With my oldest, it took a little longer and I had an episiotomy, and with my second I only had to push once and so it was a whole lot easier.  So it doesn't really matter if it's preemie or not. By the way, I didn't get an epidural with either, and it seemed a little easier with the second, mainly pressure, but I also knew a little more what was coming. If you plan on birthing without an epidural, you mainly need to relax and let nature follow its own course, because you can't stop it by getting uptight, but you will make it tons more painful and much longer.  Birth is beautiful, Congratulations, relax and enjoy this beautiful gift!!!|`|AA10526033	in my opinion pretty much yes! i had an epidural with my first who was a preemie born at 35 wks weighed 5lbs 10ozs, it hurt not to bad though. my second i didnt have an epidural she was a preemie born at 35 wks weighing 5lbs 3ozs that HURT. my 3rd was only 2 wks early so not really a preemie. had an epidural she was 7lbs 9ozs and HURT badly even with the epidural. so it probably evens out that it hurts no matter what!|`|M6q4rRKcaa	no it wouldnt be easier or less painful. The pain comes from the contractions and no matter how far along you are, they will hurt the same as full term.|`|1IDSGM71aa	Giving birth hurts the same whether you have a tiny baby or a big baby. But the emotional pain of giving birth to a premature baby is far greater than any physical pain you might go through having a larger baby.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	my friend just delivered 2 weeks early today and her baby was 6lbs 4oz

Other pretty V names: Valeria, Victoria    But honestly, my true opinion (don't knock it till you try it), is to wait until your little girl is born and look her in the eyes before you choose a name. Sometimes we think of the most beautiful sounding names in the world before the baby is born, but realize that they aren't really suited to them at all.

Soooooo many girls have Rose or Grace for a middle name, it's crazy.|`|15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	Spell it Vanya because she can be more creative when writing/signing her name!     It's a nice name, btw|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	I'm not sure how to pronounce it, but if it's like Vanna, then I like it.  Vanya looks like Van-ya and Vania looks like Vane-e-a.|`|WyQuDaRyaa	I think Vanya Rose Gonzalez is perfect just how it is.    Great, unique choice. Good luck with your new baby girl!! =)|`|vwTyihvvaa	Vanya, the first thing that came to my head was vagina.  Kids were tease her for life with the name Vanya.|`|IwvOKjfcaa	I think its absolutely perfect!  Gorgeous :)  Congratulations|`|NvCcdszsaa	I think Rowan is a gorgeous name, and liberty. :D|`|b7e5d16fdf01ca92417f762dc4d6df63aa	Vanvas|`|WBw65vJqaa	Vanya|`|rzue7CYuaa	Maybe you could name her vanesha ( van-ee-sha) its kinda like vanya but longer.
dwAZSVFHaa	no itsnot your period, but your ovolation does produce yellowish discharge|`|N24wkFROaa	i was suppose to get my period 2 days ago, all im getting is what your getting :S|`|MdSU0s8Saa	no you don't this is just discharge  if it's not itchy, smell or uncomfortable then it's completely normal|`|L1g6ZnkXaa	i dont think its your period|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Not weird and, not your period.|`|GnKb4cFEaa	dont think its your period|`|p3GZERIsaa	It's not your period, just your body cleaning itself and getting ready for your period|`|uhj76Fkpaa	no it's not your period|`|NvCcdszsaa	I have gotten that, wait 12 more hours and if not, you should get help I dont think thats healthy, i dont even get my periods anymore, its probably cuz i didnt get help lol.|`|YjE0AJSnaa	i dnt think so but it sounds like a yeast infection. does it itch? does it have a smell to it? if it does then it could be a yeast infection
1CryEnb3aa	Awww!  Congrats!|`|bLluZIeTaa	well did the Doctor tell you it wasn't a miscarriage?it really sounds to me like implantation bleeding,and it is normal to have it before your missed period alot of people will think that's its there period and they don't even know they are pregnant until the next month,good luck|`|XLFvP6pDaa	I read your question yesterday and I'm happy for you. What a relief! Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy and relax. Congratz.
eg3ImKfHaa	It's called being SEXUALLY REACTIVE.     She is reacting to what happened to her in the past in an inappropriate way. She needs to go (back) to Counseling. If you do not get her the "help" she needs, she will continue this behavior and it will worsen. If she does not get PROFESSIONAL HELP from a licensed psychologist and she is "confronted", it will only push the inappropriate behavior to be hidden.     THIS WILL NOT STOP UNLESS SHE GETS HELP!    If her parents are unwilling to get her the assistance she needs, YOU must bring up this behavior to Children's Hospital or her Pediatrician. If they are worried about Counseling costs, she may qualify for "Victims of Crime" assistance from which ever State you are in, which will cover the costs.     Her younger brother also needs Counseling, because now HE has been touched inappropriately...sexual abuse spreads.    She is not a "bad" girl. Only her actions are. It is not her fault, but any adult who knows her is at fault if she is not given the appropriate Counseling.     *THE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT GET THE HELP THEY NEED ARE THE ONES WHO GROW UP TO BE MOLESTERS*   (while I understand that this is a generalization, that is what I have been told)    Are you willing to take that chance?|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	She has the natural curiosity of a 10 yr old, but it has been warped slightly by the other boy touching her when she was younger.  She may need to have some professional counselling, is there any available @ her school?   Keep an eye on her as she gets older she may become more open towards boys advances - it needs to be nipped in the bud now.   Good luck.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	she's 10, she's just discovering sex and is probably curious. you need to have a talk with her about it. Explain to her that it is not right.|`|IvU7WH8baa	well if she was a few years younger it would ok and normal. younger kids have no sexual means to other kids its just something they saw and are acting out but u say she is 10 that's a iffy age. u said she was touched at a younger age. this could be something that she feels is normal but its not and sees nothing wrong with it because no one ever gave her a proper conversation on her being touched so she feels its ok to acted out like that. she needs to a some kinda counseling that would be the best thing. 10 is an age where she is learning to be set in her ways so it needs to be corrected asap this could turn into something else|`|el2blDi4aa	hmmm|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	children who have been sexually abused tend to have more than usual knowledge about sex and use the knowledge inappropriatley because they are immature.  She desperately needs counseling by a Dr.  She should be taken to her family Dr for guidance as to what Dr to go to.  Please continue to watch out for her and encourage her mom to get help for her before it's too late and she hurts someone.|`|6DWJAaSeaa	she needs some serious help and so does her parents and her brother (for having to deal with such an unruly sister and having to live in such a house hold that would cause such behaviors as this) there is something more going on in that house that your not being told, being touched in the wrong place as a kid does not cause such behaviors unless its an everyday thing or if her parents didn't do anything about the problem when it happened.. seek the truth and seek her some help before she has a kid a 13 and the tax payers of America have to deal with her!|`|XOdzZkOxaa	well she is only 10, but u guys need to explain to her what's right and wrong and show her how she should act.|`|2L3MXZMTaa	kids do typically act out after being molested or sexually abused, I'm particularly concerned about the fact that you are the one asking the question and not the parents. the parents need to wake up and get back on the helm, they need to get her help quick before she does something to damage her brother too. Sexual abuse has a tendency to be contagious.|`|8vIh7iewaa	She might just be more horny than other girls, this is not a joke.  When i was little i was touched when i was little; by my boy cousin, after that i realized i became horny. The doctor said that my hormones got a little stimulated and that there wasn't really anything to do. So my opinion is that she is going to be like this, for a while..  By the way i'm not a whore or a slut.  my advice would be to not leave her alone with anyone not even little kids her age or even by herself.  I hope i helped.
yJXX9kLqaa	NO, you could have a missed miscarriage. Basically the baby dies and your body doesn't realize it. I had one last summer. I should have been 17-18weeks they couldn't find the heart beat. found out later that the baby had died at 8weeks I had to have a D&C to have it removed because my body wouldn't take care of it own its own, and the longer its in there the higher the chance of life threatening blood infection|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Not always. There is what they call a missed abortion or missed miscarriage where the baby dies inside your uterus. I had one in August last year. I discovered after an ultra sound that there was no cardiac or motor activity at 18 weeks! So I had to undergo an MVA. Did not bleed prior to MVA|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes and the flow depends on how far along you are. 20% of pregnancies end before a missed period so the woman goes on with what she thinks is her normal period...normal flow but it's a miscarriage. It just depends on how far along you are.|`|AA11763588	Yes you will bleed. Your body is cleaning everything out.    Most times it starts out like when you first get your period an then gets heavier.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	definetely...really heavy|`|a1ymHaWAaa	bleeding cramping starts like spotting but doesn't stop even if you put your feet up.Increases both pain and bleeding.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I had one and the bleeding was very heavy like when I have my period and the cramps were unreal!  You can bleed a little bit while pregnant too.
IvU7WH8baa	take a test 2 weeks after ur missed period. it should read correct.|`|p8sJm5ckaa	one thing i can definatly say is that women dont getany pregnancy syptos till about 3 months into the pregnancy if you hae already taken some home pregnancy tests and they are negative and you want answers i suggest going to your dr... and tell them whats been goin on they can take a blood test to see if you are and they are more effictive on finding out than a take home pregnancy test.. dont freak youll be fine youseem to be just over reacting  dont worry :)|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Take another test in 3 days or go to the doc and have a blood test done.|`|1CryEnb3aa	My breasts hurt a good 2 weeks before my period last mo and I was 9 days late for my cycle.  I thought for sure I was pregnant.  I am very regular.  I started.  I was very disappointed.  With your irregular cycle and this new symptom, just go get a blood test done.  This can detect from the first day of conception.  Good luck and hope you get the results your hoping for.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I off and on would get sore breasts/nipples before my periods. Didn't happen all the time and would start up to two week before my period around the time I ovulated.     Take another test in 3 more days. It takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to double in your body. The higher the hormone the better the chance at a positive IF you are pregnant. You said yourself you are irregular. Stress (like worrying about being pregnant) can delay your period as well.|`|2soyTz7eaa	Have you had sex? I figure you have? Did you use protection? If not then I would say that you are just worried. I really doubt that you are pregant
dPmK83UYaa	If u take him in all they will do is give him a dose of tylenol AND motrin and stripped him down to his diaper. Since tylenol and motrin are different and can be taken at different times.     This can help bring ur toddlers fever down and drinking plenty of water. Make sure he/she is urinating ok and not dehydrated. Take the child in if it gets to 103 or 104. But try to give them the medicine and see if it will go down. usually if the child starts sweating it is a sign of the fever going down and they feel a lot better.    Schedule an appointment to check for any infections. Strep? ear? whatever symptoms they might have.|`|qWn6oZ9Kaa	tylonel, and IB profen will drop the fever.(KIDS meds only! not adult meds!!)    call the ER just in case.|`|vNaAZU3gaa	Put a semi cold wash cloth on her fore head and get her some childrens tylenol.. If the fever continues after 30 to 45 mins take the baby in to a clinic or er.|`|eMFYNGI2aa	if your toddler has a fever of 102.7 under the arm u add a degree so 103.7 u need to get off the comp call a nurse and get that baby in a cool tub fast, I'd head straight to the ER that's one sick little baby.  Good Luck.|`|MXWyX4PRaa	103.7 is pretty high.  The onset of a bad virus can cause a sudden high fever, but I would take them to the E.R. or a 24-hour walk in clinic and have them examined just to be safe.    Cool baths and motrin may help, and strip them down to underwear/diaper.  Warm baths and extra clothes can raise the body temp to a dangerous level.  If it doesn't drop to a normal temp in an hour or so, get them to a doctor.|`|AA11499514	I would consider that high. Give him/her motrin or tylenol and give him/her a bath.  If the fever gets higher or doesn't go away of course take them to the Dr.  You should also call the Dr to see if they want you to take them to the hospital.|`|xuA7DIOWaa	102.7 is a high fever in and of itself, so even if there is 1 degree difference it is high.  I would call the local nurse line or your pediatrician's after hours line, meanwhile you may want to take a cool, wet cloth and rub on the back of your child's neck and put one on their forehead (one of my children likes a cool paper towel to be rubbed behind their ears as well.  My children like to munch on shaved ice when they're running a fever or a popsicle may help.  Anything cool may help comfort your child.  Blessings and prayers for you and your little one!|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	Yes, you have to add a degree, which means your child is running 103.7--which is VERY high.  I would NOT put him into a bath, you could put him into shock.  Give him/her tylenol or motrin, but I'd probably be heading to the ER right about how.  Children can have febrile seizures from running a high temp, which can lead to permanent brain damage.  I'd call the Dr's. office just to confirm this, they should have a 24 hour return call.  Or simply call the ER or any 24 hour hotline for health questions.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	NEVER PUT A CHILD IN A COLD BATH FOR FEVER! The people above (well most of them) are giving you horrible advice. That could put the child into shock or raise his temperature. Put a tepid washcloth on his forehead and give him tylenol or motrin like every doctor and nurse I've ever spoken to has said. Never ever put your child in cold water or rub him down with a cold washcloth. Always use tepid water. That's not warm but not cold, in between.|`|16e864c8723d0a5a347f97a0ac5d3c6faa	get that child into a cool bath|`|Tpk94OVbaa	Give your toddler infant's fever relief mouth syrup.  Tylenol works great.|`|Coi21Fhcaa	give him some kids version of advil and cold water and a cold wet towel to put on his forehead|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	That's pretty high, give them children's motrin. Put a cold compress on the forehead, but not uncomfortably cold. And make sure that they're bundled up so they sweat it out...
kaqPSgTVaa	If you still don't have your period then test again. If you had tested a week ago it would have been too early. Most people don't get positives until AFTER they've missed their period.    Add: Hun I'm sorry if you thought I was being rude. I wasn't. I can see you are emotional though. I stick to my answer you didn't say that you thought you were supposed to get your period last week so that's why I answered that way...|`|4lpJRXYsaa	yes you can be, if you took a taest last week it was too soon, take a test tomrrow morning, and if a negative then wait until this weekend and take another test|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	hey.. if u've regular periods of 28 days cycle, then ur date would have been 31st jan or 1st feb. hpts detect the presence of hCG in urine, which increases everyday after fertilization. Most docs suggest that this should be taken after the missed period, seems like u took before that.  it can happen that monday the test is negative and wednesday its positive.      u should take it again in a day or 2.. preferrably with morning urine.    best of luck!|`|1IDSGM71aa	It is possible that you are pregnant and you just tested too soon. I would say to give your period a few more days and if it hasn't come by the end of the week, retest. If you get another negative (or two if you take more than one test), but you think you might be pregnant, make an appointment with your doctor or midwife for a test. Good luck TTC!|`|1CryEnb3aa	YOu very well could be pregnant.  Go ahead and take a test its late enough.  Good luck and hope you get a BFP!
q82cqg3raa	You have great taste! I absolutely love the names you chose!  Alexander, Nathaniel (spelled like this), Luke, Grace and Madeleine are actually on my list of favorite names.   Grace Madeleine works perfectly with your kids' names.  Congrats!|`|Elxuvon8aa	it fits well none of the names really have a nn so it fits|`|Uhyu3iCbaa	They do go fine together, and I love the names Grace and Madeline.  If you don't mind me suggesting, I think it flows more smoothly as Madeline Grace.  If you name her Grace, Hannah is the only one with more than one syllable in her first name.  Just something to consider.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	Perfect! congratulations too...|`|vwTyihvvaa	Grace goes good with the group.    Congrats!|`|xpUyH0psaa	it sounds alright. grace madeline will be better.|`|qa4gjD52aa	They seem to all go together. there very american names.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	They all sounds very nice together! I love the name Grace, it's very classic. If you pronounce the middle name mad-e-lin, spell it Madeleine. If you pronounce it mad-e-line, spell it Madeline.    I think that Grace Madeleine is very nice! Congrats and good luck.        :)|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	The names all go together very well.  I like the spelling middle name Madeline    You have made great choices of names|`|8wn7rQH4aa	Nice Names!!    I love Alexander and Luke! Is Drew the nickname to Andrew, because I LOVE LOVE LOVE the name Andrew, but I do not care for the nickname Drew.     I don't love the names Hannah or Nathanael, but they are not awful. And I like Isabella, but prefer just Isabelle or Isabel.    I like the names Madeleine and Madeline (they are pronounced differently you know though), and Grace is okay but I prefer Gracie and I prefer Grace as a middle name.    The names do work together I think though!|`|XgVVEKTWaa	Beautiful! But yes, if you don't mind me agreeing, I also like another answerer's suggestion of Madeleine Grace. But either are really nice :) They all go together very nicely!    Best of luck :)|`|Oiaf0aYHaa	Yes, I think work beautifully together.    Congrats. :)|`|L1Tu56TFaa	They go well together.  I like the names Grace and Madeline or Madeleine as you have spelt it (l like it that way too).  They do sound like siblings and not mismatched.  good luck. Hope all goes well.|`|cSOkd7Umaa	Madelin Grace sounds nicer|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I think that they all go nicely together|`|jhgKFJJzaa	the two names in each of the sets of names  go good together!
weBvwrloaa	from getting pregnant? No, gas has nothing to do with your reproductive system...|`|GnKb4cFEaa	no it cant|`|5p0AW33jaa	i don't think so... i actually don't see any connection.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	It could potentially lower your chances of having sex, but otherwise, no.|`|uFS5jzz6aa	is this question serious? i don't see how anyone would think this is true|`|io0QtYYtaa	well it could, if your gassy then your man might not want to have sex, but other than that no|`|KlKomVgPaa	I dont think so :-)
AA11763588	The chances of getting pregnant that way are very small.    The only way you will find out is by taking a test.    Keep in mind Stress can delay a period.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I wouldn't think she got pregnant from that instance.  But, are you sure you guys didn't go further another time without protection??  Has she taken a hpt?  Is she stressed?  Stress can play a huge role in making her period late.  Hope this helps.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sounds like stress. If she finished her period a month ago though she's probably not that late. Most women's cycles are 28ish days. Have her take a test to ease your fears.    ADD: Hun she IS stressed if you two are worried about her bieng pregnant. That is stress enough to delay or cause a girl to skip a whole period. Also just because someone has never been late doesn't mean that they can't be. Her period won't stay the same for the next 30 years, believe me. Have her take a test.|`|XjtZAFOyaa	its normal to be late or miss a period. and however you say you could have gotten pregnant could never get her pregnant.  you do not ovulate right after you finish your period so she couldn't have gotten pregnant..hope that helps|`|Lck9Fg04aa	hmmm- i dont think she is pregnant- sperm has to be ejaculated inside for anything to happen!    i think she is just having a late period- get her a hpt test it will be accurate by now|`|lBrCM0TWaa	 1 you can't ovulate right after having your peroid.  usually happens halfway through your cycle.  odds are very low she was even able to get pregnant at that particular time.    2 sperm accidently wiped on the vulva?  it is possible to become pregnant like that depending on how much sperm was involved and how lubricated the vagina was.  sperm swim remember? BUT it takes an awful lot of sperm for one to make it all the way up and to the egg...millions of them.  i'm guessing only mayne thousands were involved here...even then the odds are extremely low of a pregnancy from that.  but it COULD happen.   3 take a home pregnancy test. Now. If its negative, then keep waiting...or have her see her doctor for other reasons why it could be late.
qYvDpa6daa	wow, i feel really sorry for you, ok to be honest NO ONE on here can tell you what to do....we all have our own opinions but no one can make a decision for you if you get me? im sorry to here your boyfriend isn't happy about this pregnancy. my ex boyfriend was like that and all the stress he put on me got me down and i ended up miscarrying at 6 weeks. needless to say i did leave him because of his negativity and because he didn't support me when i needed him. you need to sit down and talk to your boyfriend, i don't mean sit down for 5 minutes in between an advert or something but take an hour or so at night to sit down and talk about BOTH your feelings and reasons for this baby. you need to let him have his say and tell you his point of View and he needs to do the same for you. you both need to listen to each other. tell him how you feel and all the negativity he is giving you is just bringing you down and its not healthy for you or the baby. relationships are hard especially when a child gets involved. ask him what his reasons for feeling the way he feels is. it could be that he's worried about money. he's worried about commitment, there could be a million reasons for the way he feels, but until you talk to him and get the whole truth out, it will never get sorted. you need to start being selfish and think about whats best for YOU and your unborn baby. its hard it really is i wont lie to you, i've been in that situation before. it almost feels as though you have to choose between them and that's not fair on you. think about yourself for now and no one else....at the end of the day this is your body that's changing ....first and secondly if you do miscarry or stay with him because you feel as though u need him just for the baby, you will regret it for the rest of your life and you will hold it against him. im sorry if this all sounds a bit too harsh, im honestly not trying to be nasty im on your side as i have been here before. you just need to talk to him and take time to think about whats best for you and your baby FIRST and then think about other people. good luck and i hope everything works out for you.|`|iMULlxdgaa	he is not a  good man at all.  he is a loser.  He needs to pay you child support no matter what and I would tell him to eff off you cna do it on your own...you don't need a party pooper around like that to make your life misreable.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Women becomes mother's as soon as they find out they're pregnant. Men become father's when they see their child for the first time.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Hun forget about him being happy be selfish and think of your happiness! Your bringing a beautiful child into this world and that's all that matters. Don't stress it won't be good for the baby and well we don't want him to get what he wants. It's wrong for him to wish for a miscarriage! You guys have been blessed. So embrace this blessing and smile, share your enjoyment with family and friends!|`|xPfJG3FGaa	just be happy about your baby, at first i wasn't happy either because of how my boyfriend was acting, but the farther along i got, the happier i got, now i'm 35 weeks, tired of being pregnant, but i'm so happy that as bad as things got i decided to keep  my baby, because i love him so much, i love my baby so much that i don't even care anymore if his dad is around or not, because he is nothing compared to my baby|`|lBrCM0TWaa	sweetie as soon as he sees that baby and holds it in his arms he will change. ive never seen a man not touched by holding his own child. he is feeling trapped and unable to supprt a family now but he will see its all for the good when he has that baby to hold.|`|f2d89272f3e228493a1f7ea002fea3efaa	You should be happy that you have a healthy baby growing and you are going to be a mom soon.  If you are ready then you need to do it.  I can tell you will be a good mom being that you care so much for your baby already and disregard the negativity that he has been giving you.  Chances are he is just scared and doesn't know what to do.  A lot of men act this way when you first tell them.  When he meets the baby he will be forever changed.  I think you need to completely ignore his negativity, let him know that you are keeping the baby and everything will be ok, also reassure him because he feels uneasy about this.  First babys can be scary for parents.|`|PBY9MNDFaa	Sorry, but this is a dreadful situation.  He hopes you miscarry?  OMG.  What a horrible thing to say to you.  He clearly knows nothing about miscarriage because he has no idea of the emotional impact this would have on you to lose your baby.  How do you deal with him saying that to you?  He is clearly worried about having a child, and freaking out a lot, but to wish a miscarriage on you?  That's just awful.     Even if you were not trying for a baby, he needs to get his head around this, and grow up - FAST.  This baby is coming whether he likes it or not and you should tell him this.  If he doesn't want to be involved then he should leave.  You, and your baby will survive without him.  I'm sorry if I'm being harsh, but long term, I don't think your relationship is looking good.  It's a shame he didn't think about not wanting children before he 'forgot' to put a condom on.     I lost my baby by miscarriage when I was ten weeks along.  This happened last January and I am off work with stress today, because of the emotional impact this had on me.  I well know the feelings you have for your baby already and these will only get stronger as you start to feel 'him' moving around.      Good luck to you and your baby, please try and enjoy your pregnancy.|`|UUysEV0yaa	He wants what is best for you and him- what about wahts best for the baby? Thats part of you and him as well.    You are right, this should be the most exciting time in your life. You are about to go through an incredible journey. You need a supportive partner, not one who is going to stress you out and make this harder for you.    You live with your parents, so atleast they can help you out. They will love and cherish this baby almost as much as you do! Granchildren are so special to grandparents. There will be many people in this baby's life who will love and care for it- its just a shame your boy friend wont be one of them    You are this baby's mother. This baby has chosen you for a reason. You must put this baby first and love and protect and care for this baby. It needs you and will depend on you for everything.    Its about time your boyfriend grew up. I mean honestly, he is 27- thats not young to have a first child. You need to tell ihm like it is- that you can raise this baby with or without him. Its his choice to be a part of yours and the baby's lives, or not.     Best of luck hun xx

8jKN7X4paa	Hola, bueno .. eso depende de la mujer.. hay mujeres que parece que se orinan y otras que no segregan nbada o en poca cantidad, ya que hay diferentes orgasmos.. hay el orgasmo vaginal que es del que tu hablas y el orgasmo clitoriano.. que es la estimulacion dle clitoris... la mayoria de las mujeres tenemos el orgasmo por medio del clitoris y don muy pocas las que lo tienen dentro.. y es una lastima jeje.. pero si estas con alguien qy ves que llega al orgasmo y no bota nada pues no te alarmes es totalmente normal... Suerte|`|3958dd8974db065838bd50130ec903c6aa	Como dicen que dijo Jack el Destripador: "Vamos por partes":    1.- Las mujeres generalmente no "botan " lquido vaginal. Lo que presentan es una emisin del lquido acumulado en las Glndulas de Bartholin y en las Glndulas de Skene, cuya cantidad vara de mujer a mujer, desde solamente sentirse ms mojadas, hasta las que segregan una cantidad suficiente para dejar un peque?o charco o la ropa de cama bastante mojada. Y NO todas lo hacen, solamente algunas afortunadas..... Y el orgasmo tambin en algunas mujeres solamente, puede ser mltiple.....    2.- El famossimo Punto de Grafemberg, o Punto G para abreviar, muchas mujeres ni se lo encuentran ellas mismas, mucho menos un varn. Se supone, dicen las afortunadas que se lo han encontrado,  que causa orgasmos mucho ms fuertes que la simple estimulacin clitoridiana y tambin son muy pocas las que saben que lo tienen y que pueden guiar a un varn para que lo encuentre y se los estimule debidamente.....    3.- La mujer NO " bota "  lquido seminal, dado que no produce y mucho menos expulsa semen ( " semillas" ,   en griego ).....Por lo que si tu libro dice textualmente " lquido seminal ", es un libro pseudocientfico que te est dando conceptos sumamente equivocados......Y mejor te recomendara, por ejemplo, "Sexualidad Humana ", de Mc. Carthy.....

Todo es depende de la estimulacin, de la forma como sea provocado y generalmente este se logra manteniendo contacto con el clitoris o su toque previo que la mantenga en el punto.    Las contracciones que tiene el interior de la vagina son sensacionales se pueden sentir an utilizando un condn, no es el que giman, muchas veces la mujer no quiere gritar cuando esta estallando en un orgasmo pero si puedes sentir o ver su abmen que igual se contrae y los movimientos de la chava es diferente.    Lograr que una mujer obtenga un orgasmo lleva si tiempo solo necesitas explorar y lleva su tiempo porque ellas usualmente sienten y no te guian hay quienes tienen miedo de alcanzarlo porque sienten que se van a orinar y te piden que te detengas pero no lo hagas tu sigue adelante vas a ver que ricura disfrutaras, ms si este lo logras provocar en forma oral.|`|IXZW0etoaa	la verdad amigo todas las mujeres son diferentes, asi como nosotros los hombres, arrojamos unos mas que otros, asi las mujeres tambien son irregulares, de hecho hay mujeres que pueden tener un orgasmo sin arrojar ningon liquido vaginal ni tampoco al exitarse, por lo que muchas ocupan una crema o aceite lubricante para que no las lastime el pene de su pareja por la resequedad    espero haber podido responder tus inquietudes|`|ca05c9204a79beda38a25d3c4692b719aa	Nunca te acostars sin saber algo nuevo...|`|1vy626uYaa	pues yo eh visto peliculas jeje y la verdad es ke si chorrean machin jajaja

Usually around 14 days after the start of your last period. If you had your period in the second week of April, then you would just had unprotected sex very close if not right in the middle of your fertile time of the month.    (incidently family planning didn't work for us as I got pregnant during my so-called "non-fertile" time.)|`|tJON5ob6aa	Well, you happened to have had sex during your most fertile days of the month, (ovulation)  but there is no real way to tell until shortly before your next expected period. Simply get an early pregnancy test. I've had good luck with Clear Blue. There are some others you can buy online that are extremely sensitive. Note, don't bother with the doctor first because the test strips they use are generally not as sensitive as the store brands. My doc called me crazy for thinking I was pregnant so early and with a negative test, but guess what? My baby is now 1 month old!    So just do the test and get it over with. That's your best bet and the only real way you can tell for sure.    Next time, you can either use protection or get an ovulation predictor kit. I'd go for the protection if I were you.    PS: If you don't want a child right now, then you had best get to your local planned parenthood and get the Plan B morning after pill.  Then, in the future, be scrupulous about using protection- it's easy, the patch, the ring, too easy to have an excuse not to use.|`|ZXNSXGYbaa	If it was the second week, then you're actually right around the 14-day fertile time (which of course varies for everyone). If pregnancy would be a real issue for you, get emergency contraception.    Oh, and please make sure to be tested for STIs soon. There's no time when you're "off the hook" for them.

6b2c780c41a3648dc5ae321eec588c0caa	The best way if you want the vitamins is to get fresh ginger root from the grocery store and grate it into some hot water.  Add a little honey for flavor and drink it down.  Some ladies just drink ginger ale soda!  The only problem with the soda is  that the sugar, and carbonation are hard on the teeth which are already weakened from the acids involved in vomiting!

Her son came out resembling the pictures very much! The only difference was the nose. For some reason, in the ultrasound pictures, he looked like he had a big, ugly nose (sorry to sound harsh, but that's what my co-worker's daughter said). I think it might be the blurring because of the baby's movements or something, but he came out with a cute little nose. So don't depend on the noses! I want an element of surprise with my pregnancy and only had one done at 19 weeks, when the baby was still developing.

I just wanted to let you know that not everybody feels that way...|`|nX2g8fTcaa	unplanned pregancy tends to cause people to focus on the negitive i think. many people are not sure if they are ready or can handle all the responcability that they are going to get along with the baby. the people that are trying or want a baby do not focus on the negatives so it basically depends on the surcomstances of conception. in a way your life is over and a new life is begining cause once that baby comes into the world nothing is ever going to be the way it used to be. although i found after baby life is much better then before mine were in my life.|`|7AqZzEEWaa	and the babies|`|4b21ffb061015cdaf4049e30bf26c665aa	If you and your spouse have built a life together - with a strong marriage and money in the bank, and you both agree it's time to start a family, then pregnancy will be a welcome thing.  Prayers will be answered and everyone will be ready for the miracle of what's to come.

My only suggestion is that she take a pregnancy test. You can buy um at the store. Good luck|`|128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	sometimes weeks and months, if the girl has irregular period. if she has irregular menstruation, she should have it checked and corrected with an ob-gyne, so you wouldnt freak out and plus, it has bad effects (when she gets older) if a girl keeps her period irregular. if you had unprotected sex, you should really freak out. but normally it skips for several days, sometimes weeks even.    - the best way to have safe sex is to not have sex at all -|`|8711089f215b5e62650e429925e1e3d5aa	She should be checked for pregnancy, if no period by the 27th of June.|`|LfVepz9Raa	you can be delay up to 10 days without your period.    so stop worrying she might be stressing.    now after 7 days you can get the new early pregnancy     test at the stores.    i herd they are good.    good luck

Dato che capisco la tua preoccupazione, ti spiego un po' di cose.  In maniera approssimativa (dato che il ciclo pu cambiare per diverse ragioni quali stress, cambiamento climatico o alimentare) il giorno in cui siamo pi fertili sta a met tra il giorno della prima mestruazione e il giorno di quella che deve arrivare. Mi spiego meglio, se hai il ciclo ogni 26 giorni, il tuo giorno di massima fertilit  il tredicesimo (se le hai avute il 3 ottobre, allora  il 16 ottobre). E' chiaro che tre giorni prima e tre giorni dopo tale data si  in un momento comunque fertile (nel tuo caso dal 13 al 19 ottobre). Se non hai avuto rapporti in questi giorni stai tranquilla.

Solo in due occasioni il seno  pi grosso e pi sodo, la prima e che ti stanno per arrivare le mestruazioni, la seconda  che probabilmente potresti essere incinta.  Ma se nell'ultimo periodo non hai avuto rapporti sessuali non c' nulla di cui preoccuparsi nel caso la gravidanza non sia desiderata.  Giustappunto, se risulti essere in cinta e la gravidanza come gi detto non  desiderata, ti prego di non abbortire, piuttosto portala avanti e dai il bimbo in adozione, cos potr avere una famiglia e VIVERE sereno e felice!!!  Comunque segui il mio consiglio, prova a fare un test, ma dopo il test, siccome non  sicuro al cento per cento, ti consiglio di fare una visita ginecologica, se non hai un ginecologo puoi andare al consultorio della tua citt, li saprai realmente tutta la verit!!!

Osn1xpu6aa	I disagree.  This would have to apply TO ALL PEOPLE-not just annoying kids in your class.    Take me, for example. If the sports/grading system was up to you, I would not be able to have done track thanks to my D+ average in math last year. Am I a disruptive idiot? No, I'm just not good at math. And I wanted to do track.|`|z3Oed98laa	thats the way it is in my school, and i totally agree with it|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you are right. they should have to maintain a certain grade point average in order to be able to play on any team|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I think you're absolutely right.     In my opinion, by not enforcing making a good grade average in order to play on a sports team, they're enabling their "athletes" to soar athletically while plummeting academically. SOME people in high school end up on major league teams - the rest of them will have to get a job just like everyone else.     Not only that, but as far as the bullying goes, I REALLY wish school staffs would be more effective at controlling students. Those disruptive bullies could be really hurting someone, and most teachers and other "authority figures" ignore them and tell everyone else to. It's BS.     I'm 29 years old and I've seen for myself what guys like that end up. Most of the guys who bullied me, the thicker-than-concrete football stars that everyone told me to ignore, are now the slobbiest, fattest, losers around here. Living in trailers with tires on the roof, that kind of thing.|`|XJEGTZJqaa	i very much agree|`|SDJ9QlfZaa	you have to have C's in my school to do athletics.....      but I agree w/you dude

SeAvCGlYaa	It depends on what you mean by "crying it out".     You can't just leave her alone in a dark room, screaming and sobbing for an hour or two. That is obviously not going to be pretty.    But if you let her whimper a bit, after you have comforted her and so forth, and as you say, she falls asleep on her own in just a few minutes, I think that she will be absolutely fine.     Good luck to you.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	She will be fine.  Your mom probably used cry it out on you.  Are you scarred from it?|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i'd just stick to the rule that "after 5 minutes is too much", as its working for you- and you do get to a stage where it is "whatever works, we'll do". my daughter is almost 11 months and i had her in bed with us also until a few weeks ago. I have the cot put up right next to me in bed (we live in a unit, so until we move the cots in there) and i think thats why the transition was so easy for us.  But after a little while she will get used to the routine of going in the cot = sleep and she wont scream anymore.  if she becomes too distressed or doesnt calm down, give her a hug, a kiss and try again.  best of luck|`|67EaIAvbaa	she'll live.|`|VVV7DSITaa	I'm pretty sure that we don't retain any memories from before about two years old, so I doubt that that's where any abandonment issues you have come from.    It sounds like you're doing just fine. They have to move into their own bed eventually. If she goes to sleep on her own within 5 minutes, it's ok. She will not be emotionally scarred. Letting them cry for a few minutes and them passing out almost right away is different than letting your baby scream and scream for a long time until they pass out.    You and your husband need your own space, and your baby needs to know that she has a bed of her own. You'll both be ok :) I promise!|`|jpgHEiCdaa	There is no way you can emotionally scar a child by letting them cry for 5 minutes before they self settle, provided (as you say) you have/are meeting all her other needs!  She is 11 months old and needs to learn how to self settle - which it sounds like she is learning!  Good on you for drawing the line now - the longer you leave her in your bed, the harder it would be to break the habit.   I personally think that anything below 3 months is a bit young to cry it out, but each to their own.  Good luck!|`|yfcJwQr8aa	would you like to for her to still be sleeping in your bed at a5 years old. Im sure your husband will not. If you dont stop it now, it will be even harder and take longer to get her to sleep by herslef.  No you are not scaring her.  Dont become one of those mothers who run to their baby at every wimper.  If she is not hungry sick or hurt let her be.  Believe it or not i have seen alot of people marriages go downhill cause the mother keeps letting the child sleep with her and her husband.   You are not being abandoned by being made to sleep in your own bed.  you said she falls asleep after 5 minutes so 5 minutes of crying is not hurting her.      Sorry mom if you can remember crying it out a 6 weeks you may have something else going on, not abandonment issues|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	plain and simple yes, you will scar her.  look at the issues you faced, perfect example right there. no baby or toddler should be left to cry alone ever, its cruel and its neglect.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	You attend to your child's needs and yes, they do come before your own. You attend to them quickly and with love and patience. Bedtime should be a time of rest and relaxation and not one that invokes fear and tears. Follow your mommy intuition. If you think it's harming her and you feel anxiety over it, then it's not the right thing to do.|`|2arZOZWgaa	Only five minutes? That's not bad at all. I personally don't let my daughter cry on her own any longer than that without going in to comfort her. Sometimes, she wakes up, whimpers and whines for a little bit and then falls back asleep on her own.    One of your daughter's needs is comfort and security from her care givers, so as long as she doesn't seem distressed in her crying or persistent then it should be OK. Trust your mommy intuition. You will know when your baby needs you to come in and comfort her to get back to sleep and when she is likely to get back to sleep on her own.    As an alternative, try putting her down drowsy, not asleep, in her bed after you have rocked her that way she is quiet and just sort of laying there. You can rub her belly or her sides and talk to her as you walk out the room.

BjY1iZS0aa	My honest answer is yes, you probably will be doing this into her toddler years. For one, if you can put her down while she is a little bit awake she can learn to fall asleep on her own. Putting her down when she has already fallen asleep in your lap doesn't help since she will get used to that and expect it. As she gets older she won't be able to fall asleep any other way. As far as waking up in the night, once again, if you pat her back every night she will get used to that and expect it as she gets older. But I understand your dilemma - when your in the same room, it's hard. You have to do what you have to do for now. My suggestion as far as waking in the night is at first give her a few minutes - start of with 3 minutes if you like, but the next night try to ignore it for 5 min, and so on. I noticed with both my kids at times that they would wake up and cry out for a few minutes and then go right back to sleep.     Even if you do have to deal with this into her toddler years, she will eventually grow out of it all as she gets older. They all do.|`|jcdey9cgaa	Mine is six and stills wakes in  the middle of the night for me to rub her feet.  It is crazy!!|`|GeMenejZaa	yes you will. the sleep habits i made with my daughter it took until after she was 2 to break, and the cry-it-out method was used (i mortified it to work better for us, i didn't like listening to her ry either). she still wakes up some nights, but all i have to do is tuck her back in and tell her goodnight. the habits you are forming with your daughter will not just magically go away, and the longer you wait to break them the harder it will be|`|wmXb8A8maa	when she is about 14 months old..and able to understand you, you can say to her no more pat on back...she will understand, cry a bit, but grow out of it as you keep saying that to her.... I finally got to stop patting my daughters butt to sleep..I just talked to her and told her no more....ahhhhh, she is soundly sleeping now and not waking up no more...  good luck..|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Sometimes sometimes not depends on the child.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	At seven months if she's waking up she could very well be hungry. You might be able to cut down on the waking so often if you give her a bottle the first time she wakes. You can also look at her diet during the day and make sure she's getting all the nutrients she needs. She ought to be eating cereal and other baby foods along with formula or breastmilk. I don't have kids myself, yet. However, I've done enough nannying for enough different kids to know that they will start going back to sleep on their own (and sleeping through the night). A good bedtime routine and staying consistent when she wakes up will help.|`|gZn622dEaa	Maybe but she will grow out of it.Just hope for the best.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	No i didnt have to do it.  I gave her something to comfort her.  She has a stuffed animal she slept with that conforts her. So if she doesnt have it then thats when she wakes up.  I was dont with getting up in the middle of the night when she was two.
lz4nK3ibaa	Not too fussed on Landon it sounds more like a last name... I think the other two a really lovely though.    Did you get Arabella from the kids nursery rhyme? That is the only other time I have seen it.    Little Arabella Miller  Had a fuzzy caterpillar.  First it climbed upon her mother,  Then onto her baby brother.  So they said, " Arabella Miller,  Put away your caterpillar!"    And I don't mind the Scandinavian version for the spelling of Kristopher|`|8wn7rQH4aa	I like Landon and Kristopher (preferably spelled Christopher) but not Arabella. I also don't like the nickname Landy - just stick to Landon! And I actually don't really think those names sound right together (not that it really matters) but they are all very different that's all..|`|lX6PzEqraa	I don't like Landon, but I think Arabella and Kristopher are really nice and classy.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Christopher is nice.|`|ENANtueuaa	Landon is one of my favorite boys names!  Arabella is really cute!  Kristopher is a nice classic name.  Nice choices, and they do all  go together :)|`|DP48dIxhaa	I dont like Landon. I like the other names. And I don't thinkk Landon goes good with the other names either!!|`|apmgNq59aa	I think they go well together. They're all original on their own and nice sounding together.|`|CeSsUpCRaa	Maybe Christopher in a more classic spelling.     Landon, Arabella and Christopher.     That looks good together.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	i like Landon for a boy, and NO on the Landy..hehe....Arabella yeah I like And Kristopher not really but okay. Try Kane or Kylan or Konnor, I don't know just some ideas.|`|AnfbukGBaa	i like those names. the first 2 are very unique . and kristopher is always a strong name. i think they go well together|`|M7gkORFTaa	those names are beautiful|`|koXcq0l1aa	I like them all.  I think that Landon is becoming more trendy, but not overly used.  And yes, they sound good together!|`|5ZvALiclaa	they're so-so    Arabella is ok, Christopher should be with the CH and Landon is just not good to me
ev0SHwMyaa	The day you are dropped from your fathers insurance you can apply. You can apply now but they will just turn you down if you have means of another insurance. Once you do apply though the process won't take very long because you are pregnant. If you accumulate any medical bills after you apply, Medicaid will pay them after you are accepted. Keep in mind this is all income based. Good luck to you.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	it's medical and i dunno if they'll take u if ur already on an insurance they might make u wait till this one runs out. go down to the department of health and human resources and ask them|`|cSm1zod4aa	ASAP.. i applied for mine @ 6 weeks and it took until i was almost 17 weeks to go through and kick in so i didnt have my first doc appt until 19 weeks which sux cuz you miss the deadline for a lot of tests. good luck!|`|LiPoEBenaa	You need to apply for it now! The process can be long and drawn out depending on what state you live in. In TX it can take up to 3 months. Plus, your dads insurance will cover you during delivery- but NOT the baby. I just found this out the hard way and I'm now facing at least  $2000 in medical bills for the birth of my daughter. I'm 35wks and won't be approved in time for the delivery and I'm also on my dads insurance. Hopefully she does not come early, because I can't afford the NICU bills! Just tell them your situation and make sure you get all the proper documents turned in! Good Luck and Congrats!    EDIT: You can apply now and still get accepted based on YOUR income! You will use your dad's insurance first and medicaid as a secondary to cover your baby's delivery since it will be your dependent and not your dad's.|`|TDOfjYGBaa	I'm 26 weeks and i realized i wasn't going to be able to afford everything myself, it's truly expensive. You can have medicaid and another insurance at the same time. i have medicaid and priority health. I applied down at DHS about two weeks ago. i had to wait a week for my doctors appt to have them fill something out and fax it to my case worker. about two days later (it was seriously really fast) i got my medicaid card which means i officially have medicaid. i dont know why the other person said it took so long maybe its different in different places? They're also going to pay my last 3 months of doctor bills..before i applied.
iUMrd7qlaa	Put you on bedrest at home, you cant go nowhere at all. You can only lay there all the time unless you have to use the restroom.|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	A friend of mine had a high risk pregnancy. She didn't have enough amniotic fluid to cushion the baby (I think, I'm not really sure). Anyway, the doctor put her on bed rest in order to protect the fetus. She spent all day in her bed at home relaxing. I imagine it's not very fun.|`|JBsilBYXaa	Normally it is if you have high blood pressure or there is a chance that bubs may come to early.  Normally you can stay at home but there are times when you may have to spend the day at hospital and go  home at night.  It can happen at anytime during your pregnancy.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    bed rest can be for :    Ladies that experience -   bleeding,   high risk pregnancy -   early labour   threatned mis.c  cerivx opening prematurely.   plaenta previa    they will place you on bed rest at home|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I was put on bedrest at about 6 months I think. I had pregnancy induced hypertension so I went on bedrest to help keep my blood pressure down and to try to avoid pre-eclampsia. I had to stay at home in bed and it was no fun. I did stay one night at the hospital but I got to leave early the next morning.|`|ejHfqSD1aa	I was put on strict bed rest at home due to preeclampsia. Today I was put in the hospital for bed rest until I deliver because I have gotten worse. I am 34 weeks.|`|LiPoEBenaa	A lot of times it's for treating conditions that can cause contractions and to help solve that, you need to minimize movement. Thinks like pre-eclampsia, an irritable uterus, placenta previa, an incompetent cervix or just really early onset of labor can be helped by bed rest. You are usually kept at home during bed rest unless your condition is so severe that the doctors would need to monitor you at the hospital.   Hope this helps!|`|TvO3eVIMaa	depends on why they put you on bedrest, where you'll do your bedrest. my friend was put on bedrest because they thought the baby was big and she had low amneotic(SP) fluid & had borderline gestational diabetes, she was about8 months and she did her time at home.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Things can happen during pregnancy that a doctor will tell you bedrest or strict bedrest. When I was put on bedrest,it was because my placenta attached itself in the wrong place- it was completely covering the birth canal, among other things.     It depends on how severe the problem is if they have you in the hospital or if they send you home.    Strict bedrest would be no sex, and only getting up for bathroom, showers.    My doc said no sex and exercise for me. He told me not to stay on my feet/walk very long/far either.
Xp2De933aa	you might be pregnant and its just showing up yet, but i honestly doubt it. have you had any kind of cramping or pains? I had spotting and pains and thought for sure it was implantation bleeding though it seemed a little early (exactly 2 weeks after period) turned out, i had a few cysts on my ovaries which also made me late for my period. good luck at the doctors!|`|VXcp8hvHaa	you are so gross
l9jVMVBBaa	you're intrusive and crossing the line. don't you want your children to trust you? they'll end up in therapy later on if you don't give them space.|`|B2vFQLU0aa	You need to let them breathe being that overprotective will just make them hate you and than when they do get that freedom they will go crazy ! You need to trust that you did a good job of rasing them still have rules and restrictions but make them reasonable. also they need to learn for themsevles and the only way for them to do that is for them to live  and expierence it for themsevles you have to let them make there own mistakes !|`|ZBtFpNIhaa	YES you are way over protective and you are crossing the line    Stop tracking their phones. stop following them around. why don't you ask them for their friends  's instead of sneaking around to get them also stop reading their Diary!!! from the way it sounds your children are teenagers and you will just make them rebel more than if you just let them have more freedom.    Its not unreasonable to ask where their going and when they will be home but to be following them and tracking them is overdoing it.|`|sqNsOIzkaa	If you really loved your children let them develop healthily. Your iron grip will only lead the children to be rebellious when older. A child won't always be a child. A good mother knows when to let her own kids decide on what. You're being selfish by constantly guarding them, invading their space so you can feel at peace. But what about how your children feel? You claim you LOVE them but you do things like reading their text which is very unethical.     Kids do best when parents have guidelines but allow them to be responsible for the choices. You're more like a dictator that rules their social and home life. Relax a bit. You are an extremely overprotective mom and your children will suffer from it.|`|CfcS92bGaa	Wow!  You would drive any person to rebel.  You need to stop being so intrusive and give them some space.  You already know you are crossing the line or you wouldn't be asking.  Get help quick, or you may lose your children.  Especially when they are grown.  I know some mothers where when their children left home they never even come back to visit.  Do you want to be like them.  How would you like someone hounding you like this?  Even if they say they love them and want to protect them.  Smothering love kills.  Get a life!|`|tt3NqROGaa	That's over the top.     What you have is an obsession with your children's safety that has reached an intrusive and unhealthy level.    The more overprotective you are as a parent, the more your kids will want to rebel. And what will you do when they leave home and you can't follow them around anymore? Children grow up, they require an extremely watchful eye as babies, but when they're older they require less care.     Give them some space. I know it's tough, but you need to back off a little before you do any damage.     I can assure you that if you've raised them well, they'll make good decisions, you just need to leave it up to them to learn how to make these decisions without you there as the training wheels and safety net.|`|5uUSJNSLaa	whoa....i SO do not want my mum to be like that. i mean, your a mum, not some freakin spy, right? thats going way overboard.    -following them around the mall is not good. i mean, shes only hanging out with her friends. well, if u really CANT stand it, just follow her for about 5 mins, and make sure everything's normal. then u can just leave.    -background check on friends and families: its okay, as long as u dont go all insane about it. i mean, its good to know wat kind of people your children associate with.    -reading heir texts/getting numbers from phones: a HUGE NO!!! this is an invasion of privacy. imagine if your parents sneak up to your phone and read your texts. ugh, i would go insane. this is not a good idea.    -reading their diaries: WTF is your problem? its their life, not yours. stop it, it's going to overboard.    overall, yeah this is good parenting, but you are crossing the line. well, some parents express love in a different way... ALSO, when your children find out, your so toasted.|`|1CVw0YtKaa	I doubt anyone is going to have anything to say that will change your mind. However, I personally believe you are going a little too far. You should evaluate why you don't trust your kids and think about if its because of how you were or is it because you don't trust everyone else? Children need to have limits to thrive but just like a rose, if its surrounded by weeds, it will not grow. Think about how they are going to act when you can't be there to "protect" them, like when they go off to college... they are going to be destructive because you didn't give them safe limits that they could live with, to help them develop healthy habits.|`|d67ULZQ6aa	The people on here saying that you are crossing the line are probably 12 years old and don't like their parents. But almost being a mother myself I know where you are coming from. I'm sure I will be the same way. The last thing I want is for my child to grow up and make mistakes I have made and make life harder on them. I personally don't think you are being too hard on them or crossing the line. I think you should have talks with them, and learn to trust them then maybe you could slack up alittle bit, but this doens't mean stop cold turkey at all. I think you are a great mother, the world needs more people like you. But I will say that if you do take it too far and they know that you look through their stuff they may not be able to trust you, and will then hide things from you. And thats the last thing you want. You want your children to be able to trust you and come to you for anything. Thats a really big thing, because growing up I never had anyone to talk to. I didn't feel as though I could trust my mom, I always thought she would get mad at me. Getting older I started depending on guys for happiness, and that was one of my founding mistakes, I messed up alot of life because of that. Like I said I think you are a great mother, just work with your children so you will be able to trust them.|`|FiUprYsvaa	No, you haven't crossed the line.  You've fled over the line putting a great distance between yourself and the line.    There is no need to spy on them, read their text or get all the numbers out of their phones. And reading their diary's is horrible. Are their thoughts not their own either??    You raise them right and trust them.     What you are doing is weak parenting. It isn't even considered parenting, you brought kids into the world and you are just spying on them. You aren't teaching them right from wrong and then letting them go out into the world and practice behaving on their own.     Look, honestly, you can do way less and protect them.   Stop reading their diary's and text messages.  Stop going through their numbers.  Stop spying on them.   And quit with the GPS.     Trust your kids because if you raised them right then they should behave.      What you are doing obviously says that you doubt you parenting skills.   How old are your kids?|`|fdc3db5cf31133cc1840e5f0bde1e641aa	It all depends on the situation but mainly it depends on one thing. Have your kids provin they are trust worthy? Have they done anything (beyond the expected child behavior) That warrants you watching them so closely? If one or many or all your children have done something way out of line and/or dangerous such as substance abuse, sneaking out the house, stealing, etc then you as a parent have every right to monitor their activities closely. However, if they have done nothing so serious as the above and have proven that they can be trusted to avoid the I would have to say you may be monitoring to closely.  Now there is always a need and responsibilty to protect your children but certain boundries should only be crossed when that trust is broken. Such as a diary. That is one of the most personal items a person has. Its an item they can lock some feelings and/or events that they may not want to share with anyone. Following them around at the mall should not be neccasary if they have proven themselves as responsible. If your kid's have strived to gain your trust they should be rewarded with it. Without trust it makes life very hard live and much more stressfull then necasarry. Keep on eye on your kids but only watch them as closely as there latest activities warrant.|`|zwvSmpNUaa	Well... if you cant trust your kids then you didn't raise them right. you should have raised them so you wouldn't have to worry about the kind of friends they choose. and I am sure the teachers are more annoyed that you keep calling them. if there is a problem they WILL call you, trust me on that one. you kids will want to alienate themselves from you the more you cling to them  they wont make friends if they see you spying on them in the mall. honestly that's really kinda creepy. they could catch and call mall security on you for stalking. they don't have to admit to the mall cops that your related. think about it they have gotten really pissed at you for going through all of their stuff so they decide to get even by getting you arrested by the mall cops.  don't go through their phones that's weird too  you want them to trust you when there is a problem they are comfortable with coming to you for help. but if you keep the intrusion up they will want to get more rebellious and stay away from you when they really are in trouble. give the kids some freedom, with restrictions, but don't be breathing down their necks they will start to hate it and it could cause friction in your relationship. its not healthy to be this involved in their lives  if you are tracking them all the way every where all the time. then when they're on their own they wont know who to make the right decisions. they need to learn from mistakes and that wont happen if you don't back off  This is from first hand expierience|`|wCpNVVcyaa	I Love the fact u love ur children, hate the fact that u dont love them enough to let thm be free. wht a parent is. sumone hu is there to run abck to one a child screws up. and you help them out of it. and they need to experince the world them selves. how long will you hold there fingers and walk around with them everywhere? are u going to do this when there lik 20, 22, whn they have relationships, when there married. do it on the ones u suspect are doing sumthign DRASTICALLY RONG. lik sex. drugs. other thn that. screwing aorund with freids. let thm make there own mistakes and pay for it so they understand from rite to rong thm slef!   plz give them space. thats a horriable thing u do for such a nice mother!|`|qewwHgfaaa	If your children have ever given you a reason to not trust them, than i see where these precautions are necessary. If not, i think some of it is a little overboard. Tracking their cell phones with GPS, going to the mall with them (with them knowing you are there), calling their teachers for grade and behavior updates are perfectly acceptable and understandable. i couldn't agree more, and think that it is absolutely all right. Hell, even monitoring their internet actions is understandable, to an extent. Background checks are a little extreme, but i don't blame you. there are allot of freaks and weirdos out there that want to hurt kids. Now reading their diary's, checking their text messages, and taking numbers from their phone is crossing the line. Yo need to give your kids a little more credit. If you raised them right, than you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Your best bet, if you want to protect them, is to make them aware that they can come to you and talk to you about anything. Be open minded. Give them respect and a little space. I guarantee, that if you continue to suffocate them, you will scare them away. If you sugar coat life, and shelter your kids, they will be naive, and fooled into something terrible, or believe everything they hear. Who better to answer their questions than you.Also if they are so restricted now, once they get a taste of freedom they will go wild. Just be careful, and talk to your kids rather than snoop. you will be surprised at how they may open up to you. It might also better your communication with your children.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	Please, coming from a teenager, just leave them alone! I know you love them and want  to protect them but if you're too overprotective they will just resent you for it. Trust me, I know, my mother was much too overprotective of me in the past. Now she has loosened up a bit and things are so much better. Don't worry, they're not going to drink and do drugs or anything of the sort.     You read their texts and phone calls? Even their diaries?! Oh God, I would run away from home if I knew. And don't worry, NOTHING bad is going to happen to them if you simply let them go to the mall with their friends. I used to feel horrible because my mother would never permit me to do so and when I finally was allowed to I felt so liberated and happy!    The bottom line is you need to STOP. What happens when they go to college? Are you going to stalk them there as well? Be realistic and let them grow up.|`|HcCYeLMAaa	your way too overprotective ! you seriously did a background check our your kids families ? & you you track them with GPS in their phones ! you can't protect them forever , your not letting them grow up . when they get older their going to be so used to having you look over them they might not know what to do . if you don't stop now then their gonna always want you there & whats going to happen when you can't be there ? you just have to ease up on them a little bit at a time ! & i understand you wanting to be a good mom & you are .|`|a90343b3faf84259b00f19bfb60ff9f1aa	The best way to protect and show them that you love and respect them is to let them grow, grow up and grow away. By being present in every aspect of their lives, they will become more and more rebellious over the year because they feel you are not letting them live their own lives. They will move away from you before they are ready and they may make wrong choices because of it. To much of a good thing can be bad.     Take cleaning soulutions. There are so many out there on the market and if you use every one, everything will be clean and sanitary; but then the second your kids step out of the sterile environment they will get sick because their immune systems are weak. They have not been able to fight off bacteria, because there was none.      To much of a good thing, can be bad.    I understand that you are just trying to take care of you children and protect them, but if you never let them alone then they will not thrive. A watched pot never boils.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	acting as you do doesn't mean you love them anymore or any less....you need to give your children some space...especially if you want them to trust you.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? If you feel this is right, then its right for you.     Personally, I think parents do need to keep an eye on their kids, but that is a little extreme. Like, I wouldn't read their diary or their texts. (btw, I would never buy them a phone, so if they had one, it would be their property) I agree with falling them after for a bit, to make sure they are being good, but not every time. The GPS is a good idea too...as long as YOU bought them the phone. But that is just me. You're their parent. ??|`|TVC3mAP7aa	I think you're taking it too far.  Respect is one of the first things that you want to teach your children, and if you don't respect them, they will not learn how to respect others.  Every person, regardless of their age deserves a certain amount of privacy and inherent trust.  You need to let go and give them some freedom.  Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't monitor them at all, but you have to give them room to live their lives and grow without you.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	There's being overprotective. And then there is down right nosy. Don't use the "i love you" line every time you violate their privacy. That doesn't justify snooping. When they find out. They will be very angry and probably completely close you out.|`|bf5cDEyZaa	Geez! You are not overprotective... this is not protection, this is being a control freak. You are slowly alienating your children! You seriously need to reconsider what you are doing to them, otherwise they will go as far from you, and as soon as they can.|`|jeztbF6naa	have your children ever done anything to lose your trust?  i think you need to loosen the reigns a little. look at it like this, you  put your dog on a leash at the park...hes obeying so you give him some slack just a little more freedom to explore. but once he starts running and acting up you tighten that leash. i dint really know your situation or how your kids act but the more you don't let them do the more they will start to rebel. if they say their going to do something yes definetly get the facts where are you going, who will you be with, what time will you get back? trust them and if they dont do as they say take away privlages, like cell phone, tv, music- ipod. but pray to god and ask him as well he will help you. trust him!    god bless,  brooke    p.s. i hope i helped|`|8idhxYHaaa	Oh you have from 1000 miles past the line. Their diaries are a place where they can let it all out. Who are they supposed to talk to? just trust your children. have a talk with them about trust. just stop all those things. if you dont trust your children you dont trust yourself. because YOU are the one who is raising them. all those things are just the makings of angry, hurt, hateful teens.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	You're crossing the line...big time. But nothing we say will change what you do so if your kids catch you, you better have your speech ready.|`|TGMUFytraa	Wow, you are crossing the line and very intrusive. I would HATE to have you as a Mom (sorry) because in the end, I'd end up hating you and not talking to you. You should chill before your children end up never forgetting you. You see it as "Loving them" when you're way, way, way too crazy. You're not loving them if you don't give them space.|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	What you need to do is watch today's (2-2-09) Tyra Banks Show. If it has already gone off go to the Tyra show.com|`|2QvIM81Haa	Wow... I feel SO bad for those kids!|`|5RoYyprkaa	Crossing the line. Kids do need their own private space.   You wouldn't want your kids to find out you were stalking them and then keep all of their emotions bottled up inside and kill themselves because they had nowhere private to go to.     My mom used to read my diaries and have people check up on me, so I stopped speaking to her for months. I didn't talk to anyone, because I got so paranoid that my mom was talking to them or that they would tell my mom everything I said. So, in order to cope, I did drugs and drank. When my mom stopped being so invasive, and giving me my own space, I quit drugs.    You're setting your children up to be just like you, and if they become you, they will have unhealthy relationships and no respect for anyone, especially you.    Great parenting.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	trrrrrrrrrrooool!|`|EkXQVZU5aa	Comrade, this technology is only for professional use, if you continue, force will be used *cough* tanks *cough*

W5VRYpaNaa	Cervical polyps are smooth, red, fingerlike growths in the passage extending from the uterus to the vagina (cervical canal).    What causes cervical polyps?  The cause of cervical polyps is not entirely understood. They may result from infection. They can also result from long-term (chronic) inflammation, an abnormal response to an increase in estrogen levels, or congestion of blood vessels in the cervical canal.    What are the symptoms?  The most common symptom a woman will notice is abnormal vaginal bleeding that occurs:    Between menstrual periods.  After menopause.  After sexual intercourse.  After douching.  Cervical polyps may be inflamed and rarely can become infected, causing vaginal discharge of yellow or white mucus. Polyps often occur without symptoms.    How are they treated?  The most common treatment is removal of the polyp during a pelvic examination. This can be done simply by gently twisting the polyp, tying it tightly at the base, or removing it with special forceps. A solution is applied to the base of the polyp to stop any bleeding.    Polyps do not need to be removed unless they bleed, are very large, or have an unusual appearance.    Should cervical polyps be tested?  Almost all cervical polyps are noncancerous (benign), but all polyps should be evaluated.    Who is affected by cervical polyps?  Cervical polyps most often occur in women older than 20 who have had several pregnancies. Most cervical polyps are first discovered during a routine pelvic exam. Usually only a single polyp develops, though sometimes two or three are found during an examination.
IGwX328eaa	I personally think he is teething You should wash your hands and stick your finger in his mouth you may be able to feel his tooth coming out. My son got his teeth at 4 months old. You can give him a little baby orajel, or some cold wash clothes to chew on.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Have you looked in his mouth on his tongue, maybe he has thrush, this is a yeast infection in the mouth and can be painful. Look in there for this first, then the cold symptoms....maybe he is bored..sometimes babies start to get cranky when they get bored. Maybe he is teething but usually with teething, they get runny noses, biting things, try to put a wet washcloth in the freezer for about 5 minutes and then put it near or in his mouth and see if he calms down, if he does then yeah I would say he is teething. Or try putting a little bit of baby orajel on his bottom gums and see if he calms down. My oldest son got sick everytime he teethed, and the doctors insisted that kids dont get sick during teething, I think otherwise but, that's me! Good Luck...hang in there you got a lot of teeth and months to go he may be easy and get 2 or 3 teeth at a time and thats why he is so cranky he is in pain mommy!!!
cSm1zod4aa	Happened to me to.. its normal, unfortunately you have to stop taking hot showers and go for the warm ones instead. Dizziness and fainting are common in pregnancy however you should mention it to your doctor anyway. Best of luck!!|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Do not take really hot showers or baths.  When you are pregnant you are more likely to become overheated due to your body temperature being higher than normal.  Overheating, especially during the first trimester has been liked to birth defects.  Keep your shower short and cooler, you should be fine.|`|HYjvCkIwaa	Hi,Debbie here,wife & mother here. when I got pregant,I never took a bath in the shower but rather in the bath tub, with the water at the temperture that was comfortable to me. I was nude  95% of the time,completely relaxed in the presence of other people.I never had a problem like yours.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	My guess is that your blood is rushing to your skin to try to cool you off or your blood is pooling in you legs causing your Blood Pressure to drop causing the dizziness or passing out.. bring it up with you OBGYN|`|r52rfBkeaa	The same happens to me - first, turn the water temperature down, lol.  That will definitely help.  It's because of the reasons you named, but also because your body is having to MUCH harder to pump all the blood that you now have going through to support the baby and it takes a toll on your body.  That's why your blood pressure is lower during pregnancy... Just be careful - sit down if you need to and don't stand up too fast.  You don't need to be passing out in the shower and hurt yourself!|`|YspTfI8Faa	you shouldn't be takin really hot showers anymore I forget why though.....|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Maybe its just too hot.  You aren't supposed to take really hot steamy showers when you're pregnant.  I'm 37 weeks right now and that just now started happening to me.  I think its because my body just can't stand up like that for too long anymore
FKf67HXaaa	she should go to the doctors right away. three months is a long time its almost too late for abortions if she is for that. i hid my pregnancy for 4 months and did the hole home tests and the first month it said yea i took like 20 and some said yea and some said no the last one i took said no so i finally went to the doctor at four months and i was. she needs to go the baby needs vitamens if she is thinking about keeping it or giving it up for adoption.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    she may have diluted her pee to much for the other tests after the positive one    she needs to go to the doctors to have it confirmed. Because she may have mis.c aswel and that is why levels have dropped and test ist showing its possible. blood test is best and will show her levels.    God Bless x it sounds like she  is|`|AA11763588	Tell her to go to the DR.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	she probably is pregnant|`|syrh8J6Vaa	If she has missed 3 periods then she needs to see a doctor.  If your urine is diluted then it will give a false negative reading.  She is most likely pregnant.|`|s6stLtvLaa	She should be seeing a Dr now.  It is important to have an ultrasound about now to see if the baby has a heartbeat (now is around the time she would hear it) and to make sure the baby is developing correctly.|`|85V6cHe4aa	probably yes because FMU has more of the pregnancy hormone in it but after 3 missed periods i would expect a positive at any time of the day although the excessive fluid intake could possibly affect it.    She  really needs to see a doctor,physical exam and ultrasound will confirm it.|`|yB5go5wbaa	yes, it sounds like she's pregnant. pregnancy tests measure the amount of hormones in urine.  it's highly unlikely to get a false positive.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Wouldn't it be much easier and less frustrating for your "friend" to go the GYN?     And just to throw this out there, but what makes you think Yahoo Answers would be able to tell you whether or not your "friend" is pregnant??|`|d68IGhgHaa	sounds like she is|`|GxlkhRfoaa	You can get a false negative NOT a false positive.
2G2KBV1Qaa	My daughter is preemie she is 5 weeks old born at 26 weeks!...I think your first 2 answers are right...buy preemie pampers, wipes, lotion etc. you can even make a basket out of a baby tub and put a baby towels, wash clothes etc....I also think buying clothes is good because i have been having trouble finding preemie clothes.....you can also buy a clothes basket and put like preemie clothes and buy some laundry detergent ( check in baby aisle they have some for babies i believe it sensitive)...|`|TvYX1yXWaa	diapers , clothes and wipes!!!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	a 'snuzzler' and a couple 'piddle pads' and a couple 'swaddle me' s by kiddopotamus; they aren't expensive, very useful and babies r us carries them all...:)|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Diapers!! buy a big pack of size 1 diapers or make/buy a diaper cake.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Lots of preemie clothes, and maybe some preemie diapers.|`|TDOfjYGBaa	Find out if they have a gift registry. most moms to be do.  otherwise diapers. cute clothes. wipes.|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	Walmart has some really cute gift baskets. Like theres a bath time one that is really cute and good for newborns.
rdGQMSyjaa	I love the name Katherine, and I actually do quite like this variation of it. I've never heard it before. I like how it sounds, but I'm not too keen on how it looks. But since it appears to be the origional spelling, I don't think it'd be necessary to tweek the spelling unless you don't like it. The only thing is that any other spelling that I can think of might look like it'd be pronounced differently. Like Kysa could be mistaken for Kiss-uh or Keese-uh. Kaisa could be mistaken for Kay-suh. So on and so forth.    Kaijsa Genevieve ~ I don't like Genevieve to begin with. I don't like it.    Kaijsa Noel/Noelle ~ I think this sounds nice. But the spelling Noelle is so much prettier and more feminine. Noel is the male version and usually pronounced with one syllable rhyming with coal and bowl.    Kaijsa Lillian ~ I like it.     Kaijsa Jane ~ Not bad.    Kaijsa Melody ~ I don't like this. There are too many M's in the full name. The Melody Martin-McDonald is a bit of a mouthful and looks a bit off to me.    Kaijsa Valerie ~ It's not too bad.    Kaijsa Victoria ~ It's ok.    Kaijsa Gabrielle ~ I don't care for this.    Kaijsa Natalie ~ It's not too bad, but I don't really like it.    Kaijsa Evelyn ~ It's nice. I really like that it honors your aunt.    My favorites from above are: Kaijsa Evelyn, Kaijsa Lillian, and Kaijsa Noelle.     Good luck! =)|`|7E37G0SGaa	* If you have to explain how to pronounce it - toss it. The kid will have to do that for the rest of her life.    * No one will ever know the meaning of a name.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	Kaijsa is beautiful.  I like Kaijsa Noelle, Kaijsa Giselle.  good luck|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	Why would you give your child such an odd name that nobody will correctly pronounce.  Think of the life of difficulty and embarassment with every teacher, professor and employer.  Parents need to remember this name is with a child for a lifetime.|`|Elxuvon8aa	If you had not spelled it out I would have no idea as how to say it I still am not possitive I would not use it because of the pronounciation sorry.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	I love the name Kaijsa! Its an adorable name for the baby|`|2rOQyvaKaa	In America we only use the father's last name.|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Kaijsa Genevieve is cute, but it doesn't flow very well.     I also like:   Kaijsa Noelle   Kaijsa Victoria   Kaijsa Evelyn     Hope I helped!|`|DP48dIxhaa	I love Kaijsa Lilliana, Kaijsa Jane, Kaijsa Meldoy, Kaijsa Gabrielle, Kaijsa Natalia, & Kaijsa Evelyn. I don't like any of the others..and I like Katherine and Katerina. Any of themmm would b good choices. And Katrinas cute too....haha|`|kU5Mbn3oaa	How about Kaijsa Ren, analeise, or Arabella for middle name i cant really think of anything that actually flows with the last name|`|apmgNq59aa	Ooh a very pretty name. Depending on where you live, some people might have trouble with the pronunciation, but it's very unique and pretty.   Personally, Kaijsa Noel Martin-McDonald sounds absolutely perfect.   It's a beautiful name : )|`|GnG5TM1qaa	I like these 2  1.Kaijsa Evelyn Martin-McDonald   2.Kaijsa Genevieve Martin-McDonald|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	Sorry, but I do not like the name Kaijsa, and it will constantly be mispronounced. I LOVE the name Katherine though (I prefer it spelled Catherine - which is more unique).    But if you are going to go with it, then I would say use:  Kaijsa Noelle  Kaijsa Jane  or  Kaijsa Victoria    I think Kaijsa Noelle flows best. And don't spell it Noel because Noel is a boys name and pronounced NOLE (as in HOLE but with an N). Noelle (NO-ELLE) is very pretty though!|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Genevieve, between those other names makes it feel like the name goes on forever.    These are my choices --  1) Noel       (simplifies a very long name)(means Christmas born)  2) Melody   (three M's in a row give it class)(musical theme)|`|lX6PzEqraa	Pretty name! The way it is pronounced, in my mother language (romanian) means "apricot" :-)   I like Kaijsa Katerina, sounds like a very elegant russian aristocrat name.
1QLp7iC5aa	My son dropped  between 33-34 weeks, but I was so small I wasn't sure. I delievered him at 37 weeks, but it was through induction, as long as you arent having any other symptoms of pre-term labor you shouldn't have a problem carrying to full term, but definitely go see your doctor/midwife if any of these things happen:    contractions that start feeling 'regular'  passing your plug ( its this globy mucus-y mess, usually tinged with blood, you'll know it when you see it!)  sex becomes uncomfortable ( for more reasons that just the growing belly)  or any bleeding of course!    I hope this helps :) I am sure you will have a very healthy baby!!|`|kZFov1x6aa	im 31 weeks and i 'dropped' last week and the next day i was admitted to hospital for contractions which they managed to stop ...   Like all things pregnancy related it could mean something and it might not. Alot of the time though its just baby's way of making more room to grow or getting into position for birth. If your having any other symptons ie. cramping i would talk to you doctor asap|`|KqloS80maa	well it usually means ull give birth within 2 - 4 weeks accroding to what to expect while expecting!?|`|01vMpHkWaa	im 36 weeks and my baby dropped at around 33 weeks also    ....so early? i dont think so....  all depends though|`|tj6MgJujaa	PROBABLY MEANS THAT HE'S GETTING READY TO COME ON OUT!   BUT ASK YOUR DOCTOR.|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	ya baby is reached his or her breeching poing...and anytime frm now, u could have the baby...|`|p3d3E75oaa	no it doesnt mean your baby will come early! but I had my 8yr old at 33 weeks and he is very healthy|`|cfdooGylaa	No it just means the baby is getting in position for labor, not necessarily that labor is around the corner. My baby has been dropped since 32 weeks and I am now 37 weeks. Good luck.|`|A2wVXRHKaa	be carefully dont left nothing heavy you cld have it early..lot of bed rest
DXLfxoTNaa	Foods that are good for liver heath are:         -Garlic and onions         -Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower,           cabbage)         -Freshly squeezed lemon in hot water         -Beetroot (Beets)         -High-antioxidant fruits         -Apples         -Artichokes          -Bitter leafy salad greens (dandelion, chicory, endive, rocket)    (check out the website, it clearly explains the benefits of each food)
1H2sTpyKaa	I'm not sure...is "Love" for last name, or a second middle name?    I think Michelle is great, nothing to be made fun of at all. Lee is also fine, and hard to make fun of.     I'm fine with Love. I think parents can't come up with as blunt of a way to put their love in to their child's name, so that seems to be were "Love" shows up. I think that's absolutely fine, at least you know you've got good roots. I wouldn't make fun of you... but I suppose people that are immature enough to be unable to see how extremely in love a parent is with their child might consider it to be funny... I think it's gorgeous. :) Don't let them make fun of you, be happy with your name. Being different is in no way a bad thing.|`|VS8mactUaa	I think its a combination of romantic poetry.|`|Elxuvon8aa	you do not have to tell any one what your full name is my sister never told a soul what her middle name  Joy was until it came out in her graduation anouncements.|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	not that bad  i like Michelle|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I don't like it, sorry. But why would kids make fun of it? Kids make fun of everything, I wouldn't take it personally. It's not that big of a deal.|`|PGUAzLclaa	Love is your last name? wow! I think that's pretty cool. The only reason they where teasing you is because they where jealous. Bye!!!!! :)|`|Oh75DqReaa	i lry like it    ppl are stuopid|`|IgVvHK8haa	No, I think it's a fine name. Just be comfortable with your self. Your name is cute and who cares if people don't like it? It's not like you really had a choice in the matter.     Plus, it's kinda catchy. Haha.|`|uHuU2j5Waa	I think its an adorable name and im not just saying that don't worry about what people think theyre stupid. :)|`|tHEBPDenaa	Michelle's an awesome name.
jNqf8HtDaa	a light jog and just stretching     thats what my doctor told me but i am also high risk for miscarrying|`|9yeyzQi5aa	pregnancy yoga...it worked wonders for me..|`|a1ymHaWAaa	walking
5j1Uhg2Gaa	I never talk to my mom about things like sex and I'm 19. My mom and I are very close but there are some things that I like to keep private, which can be a good thing. If you want her to open up about other things though don't just tell her that she can come to you DO things that make her feel more comfortable and know that you are there. Like my mom buys me medicine for my cramps and tampons almost every other time I am due and leaves them for me in my bathroom. Also if she senses something is wrong. She comes up and hugs me. When we go out or if we are just watching tv she will comment on how cute a guy is. When she does that I feel like I can talk to her more about guys. There is one thing that I did tell her about that was sexually related to a guy I was seeing. I had gotten a hicky that was really noticeable without makeup. I could tell that she noticed even with the makeup. I eventually told her and I burst into tears because I was so scared of what she thought, but she ended up hugging me and telling me the first time she had gotten one. It made me feel so much better! I hope telling you this helps.|`|yUdfN0Cmaa	you should just take a big dookie on her|`|WtzKQVGXaa	Just be there and keep telling her that she can talk to you about anything.... ask her things too like is there a boy that she likes and get down to her level... I have 3 teenagers and all of my kids tell me everything sometimes even things I don't want to hear...lol but it's because I have always got down to their level to see what is going on in their lives.|`|e0e3e97ecc5ec23822071f8a88c516b3aa	Well you cant really push too much, your doing good so far. Maybe she just doesn't think you will understand though, maybe you should open up to her, and tell her some of your past stories make her laugh, make her apart of your experience. Be more of a friend. I know how hard it is, my daughter is nine, and I really have to get down and be a kid to make her understand me. But it works, I tell her stories of my school days, and she will tell me.|`|kC37dRRIaa	You just have to be completely cool with her. Don't freak out, give her a mean look, or give her a smirk whenever she tells you something she feels is important. Just talk it all out with her. Tell her about things you did when you were her age, etc. Just be the best mom possible, like mine :)|`|8lizcK6haa	your little girl loves you! all you have to do is let her know you love her!|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	dont ask her she will tell if she wants but just tell her about Intimate things about u and she will feel compelled to tell u more and more each time u share with her|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Don't compare your relationship with your daughter to others. There's no standard for which you have to meet.   Stop and think,maybe all she has is friends. Maybe there isn't anything else to tell...Don't put on the pressure,or she may close up more.|`|VfYTGwKraa	When i was 13 i was embarrassed to tell my mom about my period. Actually, i didn't tell her when i started it. It's just awkward. But, Don't worry because i did start talking openly to my mother it does take time because that is a sensitive and owkward stage but she should come out of her shell!|`|u0mZAPuDaa	My opinion is that you need to open up more to her!    You should sit down with her and tell her about some of your intimate thoughts and beliefs. If you only discuss your friends and what happens to you at work, you could imagine she would be shy.    You need to initiate it, then maybe she will feel more comfortable. I also think it might be nice if there are some 'secrets' between you two. Are there things you could tell her, things that you don't really even discuss with your husband?    I am only 23, my mother was the complete opposite. She was an alcoholic and I unfortunately heard every detail about her sex life.    I learned to be open with her. It is now just my sister and my dad in my life. My sister is 18 and lives with my dad. I have always been able to tell me dad everything. I told him when I lost my virginity, I remember he cried.(that wasn't a good time) I always tell him if there is something going on and I need to go to the gynecologist. When I was pregnant, he was the one I always talked to about all the 'girl' things. He doesn't always know how to respond; but without a mother figure, he is all I have.    So, the advice I have expressed to you is something I want to do with my daughter.    Good Luck.    PS... It won't happen over night. When she comes to you with any 'news' act like you care. That way, when something is really going on she will feel she can come to you.|`|ei281SLRaa	im a teenager her age, and we dont go to our moms with stuff ike that because we...at least I get nervous and stuff like that. it is just an instinct. my mom probably feels like you do because i dont talk to her about stuff like that. it just feel like my privacy and i dont really want to share it. i mean, i probably tell more stuff to my friends than i do my mom. i tell them about guys i like, and stuff like that. it just...feels wierd talking to my mom about stuff like cramps from my period, and everything. i mean, ill ask her if i can take an IVprofin every once an a while, but its hard to open up to your parents about everything like that. i dont want you to feel like a bad mom or anything because she wont open up to you, it happens to every girl. they dont want to tell their moms everything. it also might help if you dont bother her about saying stuff like 'you can tell me ANYTHING' or something like that. i buggs me when my mom does it. just take advise from a straight A student with good friends, and a little shy teen. hope this helped. =]
7xit1ogxaa	No, pregnancy is 40 weeks. Some babies are overdue, but that is only because they come when they want to. The longest you can go over your due date would only be 2 weeks. If the baby doesn't come by then you would be induced.|`|FSZIzDsPaa	doctors will not let it go past 42 weeks usually.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	40 weeks is normal.  Anything over 42 weeks is usually not permitted anymore due to increased risk of fetal distress/death.  What is "way longer"?  Like an elephant?
JdyRdLwVaa	no you would have had to conceive in between august 17th to august 25th.  http://www.baby2see.com/conception_calcu...  that is th link i used all you do is put in your due date and it tells you when you most likely conceived.|`|iUMrd7qlaa	No you concieved in August sometime, you never know but good luck

Riley, Maddison and Logan. Although I knew no Logan's or Riley's when I named them. Now there's heaps!     I think the name Hayley is really popular|`|ebJ02QZJaa	There seems to be a run on Hannah, Madison, Paige, Kayley, and Sophia/Sophie in this area.  My daughter has 20 kids in her class (herself included).  Of those 20, 9 are girls.  Two of those girls are named Hannah, 2 are named Madison.  Got the Valentine's classroom list today.      Also, I know a few girls named Presley, but that's probably just a regional thing here in TN.  LOL!    For boys, it is Jackson and Brandon.|`|gl4DFLVGaa	MADISON!!!!

At the time, I didn't know ANY other kids with the name. Now, I type them into babynames.com and they're in the top three most popular. I thought I WAS being original - I have ALWAYS liked the name because it's celtic, it didn't have any actors or stars linked to it... I guess that's the way the ball bounces! I know about 20 Hanna's or Hannah's though. That name is everywhere in Canada - It actually means Grace, and it's top 12 in the girl names for 2008.

I tried to talk my friend out of naming her son Aiden.....didn't work. Then she named her daughter Abigail, another name that is extremely popular in our area.

fMnzjULCaa	I took Procheive, which I'm guessing is just another brand. It's honestly really hard to tell if they made me tired or not b/c I was always tired, even before pregnancy. I've had blood work done a couple of time to see why I am always so darn tired. But yes I know they do cause being tired, if you are on bed rest though, use it to your advantage & sleep! At least you only have 2 weeks of the stupid things. I took them from week 5-14!!  Be careful b/c they make you more prone to yeast infections. Make sure you are watching out for that too.    I took them once a day (before bed). Messy! Oh & yes, I could've stopped them at the end of 12 weeks but doc told me I could finish them out since they are so expensive (plus I was paranoid)!|`|OBn4a7rzaa	I used the progesterone suppositories until 12 weeks. It was 1 a night until 10 weeks and then 1 every other night until the 12th week. The only side effect that i had was itchiness. They left me damp down there and itchy...but as soon as i stopped taking them, it went away. I never had sleepiness that i realized was from them, although i was tired, i guess i thought it was from a typical 1st trimester.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	I took prometrium suppositories because I had low progesterone levels and was risking an early miscarriage.    I had hardly any side-effects.  However, I did feel tired and sleepy but that is all thanks to the joys of being pregnant.  That's what it's going to be like until you reach your 2nd trimester.    I stopped taking them at 12 weeks, when the placenta could take over and produce progesterone for me.  I'm 15 weeks now, healthy, and still pregnant!    They're worth the trouble.    (I took them 3 times a day, except in the last two weeks, where I gradually brought it down to 2, then 1, and eventually stopped.)    And I'm still tired, sleepy and needs naps throughout the day.  I have puked just as many times, as I have while I took prometrium.  They are subsiding.|`|8b96e3040c5552a5ae7c3bdd523c1c0faa	Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestogens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestogen.    Progesterone should not be confused with progestins, which are synthetically produced progestogens.It is commonly manufactured from the yam family, Dioscorea. Dioscorea produces large amounts of a steroid called diosgenin, which can be converted into progesterone in the laboratory. There is debate at how much if any conversion may occur between Dioscorea spp to progesterone in humans    Occurrence  Progesterone is mostly, but indirectly found in Dioscorea mexicana. Dioscorea mexicana is a plant that is part of the yam family and resides in Mexico. It contains a steroid called diosgenin that is taken from the plant and is converted into the valued product, progesterone. On the other hand, diosgenin and progesterone are not only found in Dioscorea mexicana, but also in other Dioscorea species.    Another plant that has been discovered to indirectly contain progesterone is Dioscorea pseudojaponica that resides in Taiwan. Research has showed that the Taiwanese yam contained saponins, steroids, which are converted to diosgenin. From diosgenin, it can produce progesterone.    Another plant that is found to contain these steroids that convert to progesterone is a wild yam called Dioscorea villosa. One study showed that the Dioscorea villosa contains 3.5% of diosgenin. There are many other Dioscorea species of the yam family that contribute to the production of progesterone, but there is one new species found. Dioscorea polygonoides has been researched and found 2.64% of diosgenin that was recognized by testing it with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many of the Dioscorea species that originate from the yam family grow in countries that have tropical and subtropical climates.    Chemistry  Progesterone was independently discovered by four research groups.  Willard Myron Allen co-discovered progesterone with his anatomy professor George Washington Corner at the University of Rochester Medical School in 1933. Allen first determined its melting point, molecular weight, and partial molecular structure. He also gave it the name Progesterone derived from Progestational Steroidal ketone. Like other steroids, progesterone consists of four interconnected cyclic hydrocarbons. Progesterone contains ketone and oxygenated functional groups, as well as two methyl branches. Like all steroid hormones, it is hydrophobic.    Biosynthesis  Cholesterol undergoes oxidation and NADPH twice to make 2. It then again undergoes oxidation and NADPH to produce pregnenolone 3 and performs NAD+ to form 4. Afterwards, keto-enol tautomerism turns 4 into 5. Lastly, it tautomerizes by enol-keto to produce progesterone.[12] A study has proven that pregenolone and progesterone can also be biosynthesized by yeast.    Synthesis  Progesterone, like all other steroid hormones, is synthesized from pregnenolone, a derivative of cholesterol. This conversion takes place in two steps. The 3-hydroxyl group is converted to a keto group and the double bond is moved to C-4, from C-5.     Conversion of Pregnenolone to Progesterone  Progesterone is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and after conversion to 17-hydroxyprogesterone (another natural progestogen) of cortisol and androstenedione. Androstenedione can be converted to testosterone, estrone and estradiol.    The synthesis of progesterone begins with 7 reacting with PhLi in THF to produce 8. Then it mixes with the reagent of step 1 while the temperature increases from -70C to -30C and follows it up with reacting again with PhLi along with a surplus amount of MeOH at -30C to make 9. Afterwards, 0.1 N HCl at an increased temperature of 40C is added into the reaction that leads to 10. EtOH and 2% of NaOH then close the ring to form 11 yielding 40%. The next step is the reaction undergoes methylation and hydroxylation to develop 12 at a high yield of 99%. The reactant next transforms into chair conformation 13 after reacting in TFA at 0C. In the following step, it undergoes cation- cyclization to produce 14. The next step produces 15 after yielding 72% by breaking off the cation. After that, the ring is opened and oxidized at -70C and then increases from -15C to 23C to produce 16. Finally, it reacts with water and 5% of KOH with a ratio of 5:2, at 23C, to produce progesterone at a decent yield of 51%.    The next semi-synthesis of progesterone is much simpler than the previous one because it will only focus on the regioselectivity. In this semi-synthesis, there are two ways to produce progesterone, but each way ends with a different yield. For the first semi-synthesis, desoxycorticosterone reacts with Me3SiI in CHCl3 to lose a hydroxyl group and produce progesterone. Using CHCl3 as a solvent, it gives the
Grmsgziaaa	You poor thing! I feel so bad for you. Does your hubby have like an office job he could do at home? If I lived close I would be there to help you. Maybe you could put a blanket under where he wil be eating so there is no mess, I really dont know what else to tell you, Im so sorry hun.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Do you have neighbors ar church family that could rotate days to check in on you? I had a cooler packed with sandwiches, drinks, and snacks so that I didn't have to get up. I confines us to the living room so that there was a TV and radio that each had a remote. Do as little as you can get by with physically. Communicate to your husband anything that he could do to help you out before he leaves. Try to keep yourself calm and comfortable. My prayers are with you!!!|`|OBn4a7rzaa	i havent been in this situation, im pregnant with my first...but i just wanted to let you know that my heart goes out to you. It will be tough at first, but we women have the amazing ability to adapt and improvise. You'll figure out what works, and what doesnt, and the new ways to do things. Good luck.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I'd suggest to call a local teenager you know or can be recommended to, or the local daycare and try to get someone to sit with you at least a few hours per day.  maybe you can set up on the couch and they can watch your son right around there so you can supervise.  shouldnt be too costly if its someone young and you they are just helping, not taking the full responsibility for your child.
SeAvCGlYaa	I have nursed both of mine, and both experiences are totally different.    I nursed my son EXCLUSIVELY for 12 months straight. He wouldn't touch any kind of baby food or finger food, would not drink any cow's milk or goat's milk or water or even juice, and did not have anything close to the three square meals a day thing. He just nursed and nursed and nursed, every 2 hours or so, sometimes a little less often, as well as once or so during the night, for 12 months straight. Well, I got my period 6 weeks after I had him and had one faithfully every single month after that until I became pregnant with his little sister 14 months later (which is what forced him to finally start eating something else!).    Now, with my new baby girl, who is almost 4 months old, for some reason I didn't produce the huge amount of milk that I had with my son so I had to start supplementing her with formula quite often at 2 months old, and she doesn't nurse at night now, which is what really keeps those periods away and your fertility down. Supposedly. To date, even with supplementing as much as I do and no night-time nursing, I haven't had a single period since January last year, a little before I conceived her. Go figure. Also like you I occasionally feel cramping and moody, but yet, month after month, nothing comes.     It could be anywhere from 6 weeks to a year and a half before you get your period. Every nursing mom has a different story.     Good luck to you and your baby!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	My daughter is 5 1/2 months and I am nursing.

So, it's a pretty hard one...     I knew a little girl named Michaela once... surprisingly, no one could pronounce her name either. It always came out is soundling Mitchell-uh"... it's crazy.     So I guess I don't feel as strongly as you do because mine is only a middle name... not many people find Alice hard to pronounce... But I can imagine.

w2kofruFaa	...  My boyfriend and I had been dating a few weeks (I was 14, he was almost 16). We went to a friend's party together, and he had had a few beers. After a while, we were cuddling on the couch, and I could smell a hint of the alcohol on his breath. I thought it was kind of cute... a few seconds later, he had leaned in and gave me a "sweet" kiss on my lips and being so nervous and not really knowing 'what to do', I licked him. He jumped back in surprise and asked if I had, and I denied it. He looked into my eyes, and then I put my head back on his chest.  ... A few months ago I told him the truth.

OpduZC3Eaa	Sounds like she's pretty far along. Especially if she has already begun to lactate. Expect the kittens to come sometime within the month. If you are wanting a more exact time frame then I suggest you take her to the vet and they will be able to give you an estimate. Most of the time though it's best to just let nature take it's course, unless there are some problems with the mother cat. Then it's best to have her monitored during the end of her pregnancy. Make sure that she is comfortable and keep food and water readily available when she wants it. She will be doing some 'nesting' and that means that she will be looking for places to give birth and to keep her kittens. She will want someplace fairly dark and out of the way. Sometimes it's best to just keep a towel or a soft blanket laid out in the more common areas that she prefers to sleep in. Though expect the unexpected! She may want to give birth under your kitchen table or something lol.. but even if she does then please don't treat it like a bad thing. Instead just try to help her be more comfortable wherever she decides she's comfortable. Once she's began the birthing process, it's important not to move her but still stand by and keep watch just in case she needs any help during the birth.

33O7ZTRRaa	My doctor has been monitoring me for the past 5 weeks for preeclampsia due to high blood pressure.  I was put on bed rest, but not into the hospital.  From all the research I have on preelampsia, the only way to make it go away is to deliver the baby.  For many women, their preeclampsia worsens very early, and their babies are delivered extremely premmature...for more severe cases of preeclampsia, doctor's are happy to get the women and baby to 34 weeks.  Seeing as how you've made it to 36 you are doing well.  And the drop in your blood pressure may be due to your environment (since you are in a hospital and your movement is limited). Although I'm on bedrest, my home environment is much more stressful, as I have a 4 year old, so I'm not on as strict of bedrest as I should be, but trying to comply the best I can.  Also a lot of women who suffer from gestational diabetes are also induced before the reach 40 weeks, as gestational diabetes can cause the baby to be larger than normal, and by delivering early, your baby won't be as big.  You are considered full term once you reach 37 weeks, although many women go a few weeks past that.  If they are talking about inducing you, they will most likely check the baby's lung development (most commonly done w/ an amniocentesis).  If the baby's lungs aren't where they would like them to be they will give you cortocosteroid injections (steriod shots that will help speed up the development of the babies lungs), and as long as your preeclampsia hasn't worsened they will allow for it to work and then deliver you.  Just relax and trust your doctors...they will do what is best for both you and your baby.    Good luck  |`|kOowil7haa	Keep in mind that your blood pressure is lower because you are laying down, and being in the hospital really forces you to take that seriously.  Laying down lowers anyone's blood pressure. If they were to send you home there is a good chance you would shoot up again, and you are kind of borderline.  120/70 is fine but 140/80 is borderline - and that's laying down, having your food brought to you, etc.  So it's not that the hospital is just collecting money, they are doing what's right to keep you and your baby alive.     Believe me, I know bedrest sucks. I got put on bed rest when I was at 20 weeks with my first pregnancy until the end of the pregnancy.  But I had a healthy daughter at the end of all that misery.  Hang in there.  |`|zxC8Loh4aa	Wow, that's a tough situation to be in. I was in a 'similar' one with my first baby in 05'. I know how you feel about the hospital just wanting to pocket some extra money, in many cases this is true. However, going by what you've said here, as long as your BP is in a good range and your Dr. is giving you the option to "wait it out" until 38/39 weeks I would ABSOLUTELY wait. Don't live in fear either, sometimes Dr's will tell you things just to "move things along". As rude as that sounds, in many cases you are just another number. (as I was when I delivered my son) You'll get a lot  of mixed reactions here on YA, some will tell you to "listen to your DR" and others will say "oh just wait it out" but do both. Make sure you are "reading between the lines" so to say with your Dr. If he just merely"suggests" you be induced this early, don't! If he is stressing that you do with major concern, well then obviously do!   It's really that easy. You are the patient there, you have rights and ultimately it's about you and your baby. (I'm Due Nov 21st!!) I went with a Midwife this time around and have been loving every single moment of it! I am not a number, I don't have annoying nurses to deal with (uncaring, rude etc). I'm more in control and still getting awesome medical attention/care.     I will be praying for you!!   All will be okay.. don't worry =) |`|oXzHvsBpaa	I know what your going though. I just found out yesterday that I also have a very very mild case of pre-eclampsia. I am going to be induced on Tuesday my doctor would have induced me earlier but it was the only time that he could get us into the hospital. If that was the case I would have delivered at 37 weeks which my doctor says is a good time. The sooner you deliver the better. The less chance of complications there will be. Also if the lungs are under-developed they will give the baby steriods to help. The baby is considered full term at 37 weeks. The decision is yours though. Good Luck!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	The doctor has you in the hospital for a reason...well 2 reasons. The Pre Eclampsia and the Diabetes.  Its obvious that you being in the hospital has helped, seeing that your blood pressure is down.  I think your doctor is just monitoring you to make sure you don't take a turn for the worse.  My SIL had Pre Eclampsia and she went downhill really fast... Also, with the diabetes the longer the baby is in there the bigger he/she will get. I think you should follow your doctor's instructions and do what they think is best.  Good Luck!|`|AA11132502	With gestational diabetes, by going to term, you run the risk of having a Large For Gestational Age  (LGA) baby and that in itself may have risks.  Also, diabetic women have a higher risk of stillborns if they go to term.  Premature lungs?  It is a risk at 37 weeks, but may not be as much as the risks of going to term with gestational diabetes.  They may even do an amnio to check for lung maturity.  The doctors have only your best interest at heart.  If you doubt that--have them sit down and have them explain everything.  Ask ALL the questions that you can think of. The pre-eclampsia can rapidly turn deadly either for you or for your baby--or both-- if not monitored.  |`|nkIH17Poaa	At 37 weeks, your baby should be just fine.  It is probably better for her to be on the outside at that point than on the inside.  WIth the pre-e and GD, she (and you for that matter) will have less risk of a serious complication if she is on the outside.      My daughter was born at 35w4d due to placental abruption and she was great.  Went to the NICU for about an hour just for observation, but was fine and went home with me after 2 days.    I think 37 weeks is perfectly fine and actually safer for you both.    Good Luck!|`|988545e5cde987b90322ced29ffdd6b0aa	I am exactly the same.  I am type 1 diabetic though.  But was diagnosed with preeclampsia at 35 weeks.  Now 37 weeks and have been on bedrest and strict routine for 2 weeks.  My doctor threatened to put me in hospital, but my husband adn mom both promised to keep me down.  I will be 37 wks 4 days monday when I see my doctor again.  They want to do a csection on me, because I am having issues with my kidneys now.  And I to am worried about my sons lungs.  I am trying to get them to hold off til the 11th, so I will be inbetween 38 and 39 weeks.  But I dont' know if they will let me.  But I know your worry and concern, and I also know we have to be healthy enough to take care of our little ones when they get here.  Has your doctor done an Amnio to check lung functions? 
n4YwNJViaa	The important thing is that you have the job now, just be on your toes when you do tell them and make sure you don't give them any other reason to fire you, and hopefully you'll be fine. The best you can do is be honest, and hope that the people you work for are good people, and they'll be accommodating. With both my pregnancies I was job searching, and I had a really rough time finding a job. Good luck with everything, and congrats on the pregnancy!!|`|AA10458750	Been there done that, as soon as they found out I was pregnant about a week later all of a sudden I clocked in 4 minutes late & was fired.I was never warned about being fired but they stated that they said a verbal warning & that was suffient. It was a mess. Work as many hours as you can & pray that they don't find reason to fire you =)
uFjvl4JSaa	ignore the rude and stupid comments, breastfeeding is the best thing to do for your baby and I personally love it. It encourages bonding and closeness and prevents sickness. I did it for a year and a half for my first son and I have been doing it for two months for my second son. I would not have it any other way and you don't have to get up in the middle of the night to make bottles! It's always ready to use and no bottles to clean or carry around. Plus saves TONS of money. I would definitely try it out, if you don't like it then it's your own choice|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Sorry but for me it wasnt really a decision, I have breasts and I am going to use them. Far too many pros for breastfeeding and most of them are obvious and cant think of any cons for it.  BTW it does not make your breasts saggy, I love mine now more than I did before and Im giving my daughter the best thing possible    Edit to your edit: Ok why are you smoking when your pregnant???????   WHO (world health organization recommends 2 yrs and beyond for breastfeeding, I plan on letting my daughter wean herself|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I have. 7 week old and breast feed. The health reasons are worth it. Helps you loose weight pervents breast cancer. It has everything your baby need and anitbodies it's free. If that's not enough the best is that it is always ready. When I'm out all I have to do is find a quite place and put her to the breast. No need to warm anything or add water.     Also you feel a deeper bound when you breast feed it is so   true. I agree with the lady above it was not so much a choice it was something I felt I had to do.  Not everyone can breast feed you kid.  but anyone can add water to formula .    Yet it does hurt for the first few weeks but then it is a breez I had the worst crack nips it hurt so bad but now no pain at all|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i tried breast feeding for a week but my son had nursing problems so i had to switch to formula .. i wish i could have still done it cause its good bonding time with your baby but my nipples hurt so bad|`|LUjCnYmoaa	My wife was unable to breastfeed because our baby wouldn't latch, but she went through with pumping and has been doing it for the last 8 months, i feel it was the most amazing thing she could of done, she couldn't of given up a long time ago and as far as im concerned pumping and formula are a lot more work then breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding is natural and the most healthy for the baby  i support breastfeeding 100%    It's pregnancy that causes saggy breasts, not breastfeeding. and you can breastfeed for whatever you feel comfortable doing, a year, 2 years|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u can probably find a class at the hospital you will deliver in to educate you somewhat about bfing; there are also a lot of books and websites that will give you a lot of information...i couldn't bf so i can't  tell you anything from personal experience, but as a nurse i do know the benefits of bfing and it you can do it; go for it! formula is fine, it is not poison, but bfing is the best way to go if u can....there is also a group called la leche league that may have meetings in your area that are supposed to be really helpful as well, u can probably talk to other moms that are or did bfeed and get alot of useful info there; when u have your baby, in the hospital, ask them if they have a lactation consultant or a nurse that specializes in teaching new moms (or new to bfing moms) a lot of tips for successful feeding, good luck and i hope it works out for you...|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	I didnt breastfeed my first two daughters and im now breastfeeding my 3d. and have been for 3 months so far, the thing is, I wish i did breast feed my other two..its amazing, I really wouldnt do it any other way...its good for baby, its easy, no running out..lol...or getting "up" in the middle of the night..the only thing is you really have to be commited...im always home, love being with my kids 24/7 so its no problem at all for me..hah ..I dont pump neither unless i really have to...like if we plan on being out for a few hours i would, or when i leave my daugher with daddy while i go shopping or something for a couple hours...so you should have a pump handy just in case, but in my opinion i think breast feeding is better..:]|`|UinOWcMUaa	Definitely you should do it !!! You will see the difference in  3 for sure !!  Lots of tremendous benefits in engaging in this responsible activity... you will be blessed for sure and have a close relationship with this kid..        Take Care and remember the creator who Gave you your family...|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	Pros- I found it more convienent then making bottles in the middle of the night, it is better for the baby and cost nothing it helps you loose the pregnancy weight and it is a good bonding experience      Cons- not being able to leave for long periods of time and if you do getting engorged having to pump milk to get a sitter. To me the pros outweighted the cons.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	Breastfeeding offers tons of benefits to both you and baby, I'd highly recommend it if you can.  It helps with baby's immunity, you should see less colds, ear infections, etc.  For you, it helps you lose baby weight...fast!  It also produces a chemical called oxytocin, which causes mom to feel relaxed and helps with that mom-baby bond.  It's also less expensive and more convenient (no bottle washing!).      All that said, it is a huge commitment and it can be difficult.  If you really want it to work out, you have to be committed because it may not come easily or naturally.  The general rule is that you should stick with it until 8 weeks before considering throwing in the towel because nearly all issues are resolved by then.  I've been BFing my son for 9 months now and it's become completely second nature.      Good luck!|`|reO9Dgmsaa	First off, you really need to try and quit smoking!!  It's so harmful for your baby.  At least cut down slowly.    About nursing:  It's best if you do not smoke, but if you don't quit it's still better to nurse and smoke than formula feed and smoke.  There are some guidelines to follow, like smoking after a feeding.  See the link:  http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...    Breastfeeding is so incredible for mom and baby!  There are health benefits for you both, like reduced cancer risks, less chance of diabetes and osteoporosis, Crohns disease, asthma, etc.  You also make antibodies every time you nurse that are passed through your milk, keeping your baby healthier.  It's so wonderful.    Nursing should not hurt horribly if done properly; the pain some describe is most likely a bad latch.  I never had sore nipples!  Breastfeeding is recommended for a year at MINIMUM by the AAP; the WHO recommends 2 years minimum.|`|6FXJrVjqaa	don't brest-feed bottle is better...MORE MILK 4 DADDY|`|jT8vzaluaa	Pros:  The baby gets great immunities from the healthy breast milk.    Cons:  Sore nipples.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	I breastfed. and beside just having that bond with your newborn baby....it saved on getting up and buying formula and making bottles over and over.  its a little uncoonfortalbe at frst but you willl bet used to it after a couple of days    my nipples where only sore for about 3 days. And my breasts are just as perky as they were before i had my baby.  Saggy boobs come from not wearing bras when you should and not taking care of your breasts|`|tdHIR9cLaa	breastfeeding is WAY awesome! because you know your baby is getting the best possible nutrition! it is painful in the beginning but it gets easier i hope you chose to breastfeed. even if you dont like putting your baby to breast you can pump!     good luck      Answer to your edit: WHAT THE F*** are you thinking? your pregnant and smoking. are you kiding me? and yes thats a huge problem! maybe yu should have done a little growing up before you got pregnant you dip!!!

I definitely cut that day, and went shopping.|`|kC37dRRIaa	They do it at my school too :)  But they did it this year and some of the teachers gave them zero's :(  DK how they can, but they sure as hell did.  and yes I'm gonna do it :)|`|RK04Jktraa	My school found out when it was going to be, and planned a secret party on the same day. They also put truancy officers everywhere and jailed kids that skipped. I heard about this, so I went to school that day.|`|7ePjzDZTaa	we have senior skip day    we dont go at all    but it was an idea a long time ago|`|qpmGLd7laa	My school did all of that.  I didn't participate because teachers always found out (or just... noticed) and gave extremely weighted and extremely easy quizzes on those days.  For example, a quiz like "What is your name?"  for 100 points.  I decided not to miss out on that, seeing as it could save me the trouble of doing future homework assignments.  Don't worry, when you go to college you'll have plenty free time.  Well, maybe...
2WtPKZvfaa	I'm 18 and 7 weeks pregnant with my second baby. all i notice was my periods were i week late and they are always on time. usually if its your first pregnancy you can get sore tend breast Fatigue Nausea or vomiting Increased sensitivity to odors Abdominal bloating Frequent urination miss period Your basal body temperature stays high and a  proof:  positive home pregnancy test... well if you are late get a pregnancy test to make sure. good luck on the wedding congratz|`|ZeNemqcMaa	I was 19 when I first got pregnant, the only reason why I had tested was I was starving, like ALL the time, every 3 hrs or so I'd be hungry, and then I started having to pee alot, I alwasy slept through the night adn then I started having to go like 3 times a night.My last period was on October 8 I tested positive on november 5th and a week later my boobs started to get sore, adn the morning sickness and exhausted had started to kick in when I was about 6 weeks pregnant|`|bQAvca08aa	i was 18 when i was pregnant with my son and 19 when i had him. i got pregnant while on the second day of my period, so i just thought it was a short period. when implantation happened is when i was unable to eat more than a couple bites of food without feeling sick to my stomach. in december 06 i was expecting my period but it never came, even after the horrible cramps came (always get them and then within the next 48 hours i get my period) and no period i took a test when i was 2 weeks pregnant and no test showed positive until i was 2 months pregnant. also the stress of your upcoming wedding could be deferring your period. or you may just be pregnant!!! wait til the middle of february to the second week of march to test with a home kit (by that time there may be enough hcg in your urine to test positive. also remember that there are such things as false negatives AND positives.) good luck to you both!|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	You don't really get symptoms untill 6-8 weeks. I got mine at  weeks. I really wouldn't have known I was pregnant if I didn't miss two periods while on the pill. (They were supposed to come, but didn't. Faulty assed pills! But I wouldn't change it for the world...) So after you miss your period, then test. If you're anything like me, the first thing that will happen is that your boobs will feel different. They should be tender and possibly painful/growing a lot. I also had nauseau all the time, but didn't puke. Headaches and fatigue. Good luck.|`|jPIyZRTqaa	I felt sicker than a dog within the first month.

I would be tired but I can't fall asleep.. My boobs hurt and I feel so sick when I wake up until I put something in my stomach.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Sometimes implantation bleeding is confused as a period. It often comes earlier then your period and some people thing they had an "early period".    I would take a pregnancy test and find out. That's the only way you'll know for sure.     I'm 18 and I'm pregnant with my 1st. I didn't even know I was pregnant in the 1st month because I had a period that month( september).     When Oct came, I experienced weird bleeding( what I then though it was implantation bleeding...only now I know its not lol). I suspected I was pregnant so I got some home tests and both tested positive.    Going by my LMP, I would have been 5-6 weeks pregnant when I went to the health clinic. When I had my first ultrasound done, I was supposed to be 12-13 weeks instead I was 17 and a half weeks.|`|627pWyVkaa	If your last period was at least 4-5 weeks ago I would test now! good luck.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	wel im 17 and pregnant and i wont be 18 till bub is born but there is a chnace you could be preggers, all i felt at first was sore boobs and sick but it is different with everyone.

When I was in the first month of pregnancy I didn't even know I was pregnant. The few symptoms I had were sore boobs and late period so I just thought I was going to get my period soon but nope I was pregnant. Also later on closer to 2 months pregnant I started to get really tired in the middle of the afternoon and needed to take a nap every day. It wouldn't hurt to take a pregnancy test though just so you know for sure.

h9L1AtMsaa	Here is something you can do which is also a little bit more work with 5 other kids running around but maybe you can find time...Go in your bathroom and shut the door, turn the water on as hot as it will possibly goes, turn the shower on, put a towel underneath the door to block the crack. Sit with the boys for at least 5 minutes and this will clear out their noses and calm them a little bit. Also if I were you since the pedi won't see them and it has been two weeks since they have been sick, take them to an ER or take them to an Urgent Care. They may just have viruses, personally my boys have had probably the same virus your do for about a week but I took them after it had been about 5 days and they had double ear infections!! both of them. The cool mist one should be fine for them....I prefer the cool mist one, they work better, just make sure you put blanket sleepers on them, and warm blankets. and the heat mist will make it harder for them to breath, the cool will do better for them...I promise!! Good luck honey.|`|HVWAq4u9aa	Any humidifier should work...although I have the Vicks one and it doesn't work very well unless you put a little salt into the water for some reason.  Wierd, I know, but it works.  I know that you're upset about the doctor, but I want to tell you that in my case, it did help a lot.  I kept a humidifier in the living room during the day and in his room at night.  I put the saline in his nose while he was lying on my lap and used a bulb sucker to get out anything I could.  I did this at least 10-15 times a day, making sure I did it right before naps or feeding him or if I just heard him struggling to breathe through his nose.  He was better in less than a week.  So your doctor might just be right...it was the right advice in my case.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my doc said to use a cool mist humidifier; i think it is bc of the potential for more bacteria to grow in a warm one; we have a cool mist one i bought at walmart years ago, and it is great; if yours is too strong, does it have a lower setting or can you move it further from the crib? before baby, i always used it in winter bc the air got so dry, and it has been great....i am not sure why he would suggest a warm one anyway...jmho|`|Z67HkDKCaa	dont get the vicks warm mist humidifier..

You just got off the birth control and you were on it for awhile. It can take 6 months to a year for some women's cycles to regulate back without birth control. It all depends on the kind of birth control you were on. If you go see an gynecologist they can check your uterus and ovaries externally. Just relax, it will happen when it happens. Good luck!|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	Don't worry, I've heard of people who get off of birth control when they're ready to have kids, and I hear it takes some people up to a year, sometimes even more.

I mean after your period.    you know I am mother of 4 I never think about it but when it time it is time.    pray to god to help have children and stop taking pills and eat healthy meals so your body produce enough eggs.    good luck.|`|c1d6c633bd2bfac72da6f234f5121a5daa	The fact that you were on birth control(pill??)  could possibly mean that your body is still not ovulating.  You have only stopped since May.  Some women don't automatically start ovulating again or it could mean that your timing is out.  It's only been six months - you are not classified infertile until 12 months of trying to conceive.  Continue to try.  I don't think the dr. has done anything to you, they cannot do anything by law.  Have you seen your dr. yet - had a blood test?  There are things you can do to see if you are ovulating.  There are ovulation kits that you can purchase at the drug store/chemist that will help you determine whether you are ovulating.  There is also the Billings method and temp method  Check these sites out.  Learn to understand your fertility and the times you are fertile.  Try and relax.  (not that relaxing has anything to do with fertility)  but I don't think you should be alarmed just yet.

AA10365213	Your stomach muscles are stretching to accomodate your growing baby.  There is a seam that runs down the middle of your stomach muscles that opens and stretches.  Depending on how big your baby is will depend on how wide the space gets.      Your muscles feel like you are working out because they essentially are!  When you slouch you are pushing the baby forward therefore stretching the muscles and contracting them when you straighten up.    Hope this helps!|`|e0365d6792f0aa9935ca4c7113a3f908aa	I'm the same way.  After I sit awhile, I feel as though someone hit me in the gut.  Sometimes I'll feel as though I'm leaning on the baby's arm, which is uncomfortable, especially when I'm driving.  As the baby and belly grow, things inside get crowded and push up towards the breast area.  I even had to stop wearing underwire bras because those made me very uncomfortable.  But one thing that has helped is putting a pillow behind my back.  It fills the gap between the back of my seat and my back, and gives me comfortable support.  As for the bra thing, I switched to the IPEX bra by Victoria's Secret.  Much more comfortable and it provides great support for my set.
8b70b962257dfa387c69707168e221d4aa	I know exactly what you're talking about. I have a 4 year old that started to refuse to nap about that time. I now have 20 month old twins are that doing the same thing. It may be time to change his routine. Instead of a nap, maybe just quiet time after lunch? Lay down with him and read a book? That way he's not sleeping, but he is resting. That's doing the trick for my twins.|`|1428712b5c8c4d04fa9d7f70a2bccd25aa	All answers so far are great and basically I think you know you are not alone.  My 21 month old granddaughter (I babysit) does the same.  After a couple days of it she will sleep 12 or 13 hours at night.  I still try to put her down for a nap because she needs   alone time.  If she is happy and just talking and playing I may leave her there for an hour or so.  If she is pitching a fit I get her up so she doesn't associate the nap time with being unhappy.      THEN it is a struggle to get her to stay awake later around dinner time until it is bed time because a nap that late in the day is BAD for trying to get her to bed.    We are all thinking of you and I think the message is to be patient.  He may still go back to naps.  When the weather gets better and he can play out regularly that may help.  Good luck!|`|yV7ltYAvaa	yes it is normal I have 2 children and neither one at your child's age would take a nap either.  All of my friends kids would no matter what I did they wouldn't go to sleep  good luck to you|`|AA11311000	It's very normal for kids to stop taking naps during the day at that age.  They get caught up in wanting to play and discover new things.  As for what to do to get him back on a routine.. there are a lot of different ways to do it.. You can try just rocking him in a dark, quiet room so that he can at least relax.  You can let him "cry it out" and see if he eventually falls asleep.  Or you can just lay him down and check on him periodically to be sure he's ok.. but don't pick him up.  Just let him know that you are there, but that it's nap time so he should try to rest.|`|EOEqsDOHaa	Some children do drop their naps early (even when mum knows they still need it).  When my boys were toddlers and wouldn't nap I found that trying to force it would be more upsetting for everyone so would have quite time instead - curl up and read a story with lots of cuddles or very gentle play.    good luck|`|SyFyaXHEaa	I am mother of 4 and grandmother of 7 and I can tell you I have seen that more times than I care to count. At that age they go through a growth spurt that sends their internal clock off its ticker, so to speak.  Sounds like he may need to up his physical and mental stimulation. At that age their curiosity is over loading and they tend to feel like they are missing out on something. Give him more time outside or in the kitchen with you. Let him explore the lower cupboards on his own about an hour or so before his nap time. I don't know about you, but my bottom cupboards are full of pans, and plastics. I just open a cupboard and let them have a go! If the weather permits, take him outside and let him get really dirty. In the summer time I would dig up the dirt a bit put the hose in there and make a bit of mud. They play for about an hour then it's time for a shower and off for a nap. You would be surprised how well this works.  Now, I live on the second floor of a flat and the noise with pots and pans can be...well..a bit annoying so place a blanket on the floor to muffle the sound. It you don't have a garden area get a couple of plant buckets and fill them with some soil. Don't use planting soil, it has some things in it I don't find is very safe for kids. Just some nice fresh dirt from outside will do! Put them on your porch or even in the middle of the kitchen on a blanket. The blanket washes up and so does the baby and the dirt.  Now that the baby is finally down for his nap Mommy is ready for a cup of tea. And, bloody well time, I say! lol  Good Luck
AA10604871	Do a home pregnancy test.  You can get a cheap one at a discount store.  That would be the best thing to do to be sure.|`|6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	If you never miss your period then you are probably pregnant. I am very regular and always know when I'm pregnant because I'm never more than a day or two late.    In fact, I don't always take a pregnancy test because EVERY time my period has been a couple of days late, I was pregnant. It's a failproof sign for me.    The spotting and cramping are classic signs, too, as is fatigue.    What you think is a cold might actually be related to pregnancy, too. I always get a sort of stuffy feeling in my nose when pregnant - the hormones cause tissues to swell.    You can get a really cheap pregnancy test today at the drug store and get a leg up on the doctor.    Best of luck!|`|xUsIv0Qvaa	I'M THE SAAAAME WAAAY!!! WE'RE NOT ALONE, EITHER.

She took a test and yes she was pregnant, shes due this June. Have you taken a hpt yet?? Since its been 4 days and still no period then I think you can get a good result with a hpt now. I would take one if it worries you so much or you could just wait it out over the weekend and find out on Tuesday. Good luck to you.|`|AA12284313	wait a few more days, if your period is a no show, take another test. if you are this concerned, schedule a dr appointment for a blood test.   otherwise if you get your period or get another test thats negative, you most likely aren't pregnant

Life rolls on so fast, here today and gone tomorrow.  You never want to be in the position where you kick yourself later for not having done something that meant so much to you.  It's a bad place to be.    If you like him, then just ask him if he would like to go with you to the dance, or if already there, walk up to him during a fast dance and say, "want to give it a try?"  Linger just after, and I bet you'll end up with slow dancing, and becoming a little more familiar with one another.  Some guys just don't know how to ask, and many times, they feel that the gal is "too hot" for them, too pretty, ya know?  Just do it.  Just walk up to him and ask him if he'd like to go get a soda with you and begin at the beginning   You got to start with the baby steps.|`|LFREP3UZaa	wait for him to ask... if hes slow, make a move on him, flirt a little then he will def ask you to dance and you can have funw ith him as tension dies down =]|`|6tMaSHpPaa	either or but i think boys asking girls isnt as weird|`|FFE4iLWtaa	you seem so pure,now both do the  1move.do what yur heart tells u... boy+girl=same.|`|QHDl7gc5aa	In this day and age it dosent matter who makes the first move.

AA11605655	Of course you could. There is no time that you are 100% safe from becoming pregnant (even if your in the middle of your period). The only thing that is; would be abstanance.    His pre-ejaculate could get you pregnant because there is still a large number of sperm present.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Your fertility depends on your ovulation, not your period, So it is not imposable, but I don't think you are.

You might not be though, it could go just like that though.  The second trimester is the best though so it might sort itself out.  Try to enjoy though.  Good luck.|`|AA11599003	i am not sure, but visit a doctor woman.|`|AA12189751	I notice that you have 1. nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and 2. heartburn in pregnancy.    Problem 1:  NVP usually settles by about 16weeks (4 months). Some women do go on experiencing it for many months. Perhaps till delivery. What is MORE important at this moment is FINDING a CAUSE.     There is a myriad of causes. This, is best assessed and diagnosed by a qualified M.D. Suffice to say, your symptoms should not be brushed off as something normal.    Problem 2: Heartburn  Heartburn is an annoying side effect, caused by food moving back from the stomach to your esophagus. Normally, food travels only one way. But in pregnancy, the junction between esophagus and stomach relaxes.    The acidic content from the stomach ultimately causes irritation as it comes into contact with the inner wall of the esophagus    To reduce the symptoms:  1. Wear loose-fitting clothes at night  2. Avoid tight-fitting clothes throughout the day  3. Avoid oily / deep fried stuff at night  4. Have your dinner early  5. Avoid spicy stuff at night    Hope these tips will help|`|J7igxnj0aa	i was sick everyday, sometimes several times a day, until the day i gave birth.  i really feel for you.  i went to the doctors at about 25 weeks and explained that as i couldn't keep anything down i felt lethargic all the time and he gave me some tablets to take the edge off.  you need to find a safety food, mine was mashed potato.  i could eat that knowing i wouldn't throw up.  just go with it, you're over halfway there now, and once that little baby's born you'll soon forget about feeling sick. good luck.  **raspberry leaf tea is a godsend too, it settled my stomach and can help to shorten labour!  mine was 2 hours from 1st contraction to delivery, and i only did 3 pushes!!****  good luck again x    by the way, what your wear doesn't affect morning sickness in the slightest,  spicy food can trigger heartburn tho but that was my craving and i suffered for what i loved!  just enjoy it as best you can x|`|4561f56b7e8a45bd29405caeac741d5caa	Yes this is very normal in some pregnancy. I had it so bad with my second that I had to get on some kind of heartburn meds. I also ate tums like candy it was so bad. When you go into see your doc let him know how bad it is and ask him if he can get you on some kind of heartburn meds. Now about throwing up you might be one of them that throws up threw there entire pregnancy. Also when I was pregnant with my daughter that's how i was and then with my son I didn't throw up much at all .|`|ufKahy4Oaa	my friend was "sick" everyday of her pregnancy until she delivered... i hope you aren't that way, but it's probably normal|`|r4oC8KkCaa	I heard saltine crackers could help. Good luck!|`|bd5120a677d9fc171dc87aec33111922aa	Sorry but it is normal however it can be a concern.  I was sick at least five or six times every day until the baby arrived.....yellow bile to me means that there isn't any food or drink left in there so you're throwing up bile which is on your stomach lining.  Horrible burning nasty stuff.  Anyway, this can be a concern as you are depriving your body of essential vitamins, food, energy, etc etc.  The doctor saw me and said that there are no pills that can help without a risk to the unborn baby.    The medical term for severe morning sickness is called Hyperemesis Gravidarum and I actually had to stop working and got the whole of my pregnancy off on the sick as I just felt so sick all the time.  No good when greeting clients to start heaving and retching in front of them.    Everything and anything could start it off - smells usually.  As it turns out it does stop as soon as baby is born - bumpf- no more sickness.......until the next time you get pregnant..lol...    Apparently, you are more likely to suffer this type of morning sickness if you are:-    prone to feeling sick on the pill; (oestrogen)  expecting a little girl - (even more oestrogen in your system)    If you are expecting a lil boy you can be sick due to the rise in your own oestrogen levels but then the testosterone balances things out and your body adjusts accordingly.  If there is a lil girl about then not only are your oestrogen levels going up but the baby's oestorgen levels are helping to intensify the load as well. (please note that this is a theory and not concrete proof - but it does have an element of sense in it).    I don't know of anything that helped me get rid of the sicky feeling, (people tried telling me over fifty things to try and stop it), but nothing worked.   If it is any good I went on to have two more children a boy and a girl, - hardly sick with the boy, sick up to about sixteen weeks with little girl - so I suppose it could be worse if you are expecting for the first time.      I really do sypathise and hope that you see it through okay as it does tend to spoil the whole pregnancy thing a little....but the end result is going to be the best thing in the world and you will probably, begrudgingly, be glad you had to go through it...|`|Z6UZ7Iu8aa	I was really sick when pregnant! The only thing that I found to help was a prescription from my midwife for Reglan. It is very safe. So ask you OB about it. If it is only at night and with bad heartburn....Try eating some tums after dinner, and cut out spicy or acidic foods. Also eat some tums as soon as you feel the heartburn coming on. Or eat some plain white bread or saltine crackers which will help soak up the acid in your stomach. Hope this helps.
mbO6yVakaa	Um....no. If you are breast feeding it is much less likely that you will get pregnant, but there is still no guarantee. My boys are just a year apart and when I got pregnant the second time I hadn't had my first post-baby period yet.|`|3342a98d3a173fa43509f0af219b81a9aa	If you had unprotected sex, you have a good chance of being pregnant again.

When going to buy your bumpers make sure that it has ties on the bottom and top to tie to the crib.

When we first put him in the crib was when we got home from the hospital; he moved around a lot, and would get his face in it, so we decided to put him in an infant seat that we had for the first 3 weeks or so. I was so paranoid. Then we put him in the crib and I would have to feed every 2 hours or so, then that is when I would check him. As he got to be to 5 weeks, he didn't move as much and it was ok. He has slept with it since then.|`|iwDkiT1Waa	To prevent SIDS, they say not to use one at all. I used to find my son's arms, feet and legs stuck in between my crib's pickets so I went out and bought a breathable bumper. It doesn't look 'great' (not plush, just enough to keep his limbs out), but I feel better knowing he is getting the air circulation he needs to help prevent SIDS. I know that he's pretty active and fairly soon that won't be enough for him, but after about 4 months of age, the risk of SIDS drops but it is still there until the child is 1 year old. I took back my bumper I had fallen in love with; I may go back to get it again depending on how active he gets at night.    Its a tough call...I wouldn't make any decisions until you meet your little one. I truly think every child's needs are different.    Good luck!

Le bb est nourri par le placenta via le cordon ombilical.    Ce placenta est insr directment dans tes vaisseaux sanguins: il les dtruit, pour former des lacs de sang (c'est le terme mdical)  Quand tu accouche, le placenta sort, laissant ainsi les vaisseaux sanguins bants, ouverts sur l'extrieur.  C'est un moment critique, car le dbit au niveau de ses vaisseaux est d'un demi litre par minute.  L'utrus est compos, entre autres, de muscles.  Ces muscles forment une espce de grillage crois, qui quand le bb est sorti, peuvent se resserrer, car l'utrus devient tout petit. (tu as d? le remarquer, il ne va plus jusqu'en haut de ton ventre, mais est en dessous du nombril).  Ainsi, les vaisseaux sanguins sont un peu ferms, et on ne saigne pas autant que si ce "grillage" ne s'tait pas serr  C'est un peu comme ci tu mettais un tuyau dans un grillage serr, ?a referme un peu le tuyau    Mais, ce "grillage" ne suffit pas, il  a encore des fuites, et il faut pour que ?a arrte de saigner que les vaisseaux soient compltement ferms, que l'utrus soit revenu  sa taille normale, etc...    Et ?a prend du temps, 3 semaines en moyenne.  Progressivement, le sang devient moins "sanglant".  Au dbut, c'est comme des grosses rgles avec des caillots (des morceaux), puis ce n'est que du sang, puis du sang ml de scretions, puis que des scrtions avec un tout petit peu de sang, puis plus rien.  Cette priode de saignements s'apelle "les couches"    Aprs que ces saignements se soient arrts, un nouveau cycle se remet en route, avec une nouvelle ovulation et de nouvelles rgles: les saignements reviennent, c'est le "retour de couches".  Cette priode entre les couches et le retour de couche est variable, et dpend de si on prend une contraception ou pas, de si on allaite ou pas, etc...|`|JxelP5DBaa	faux: ce n'est pas plus long avec une csarienne! au bout d'une semaine, c'tait bon pour moi!

NJxEJwu0aa	They told me at 5 weeks my daughter had colic and I switched her to soy. But then she was vomiting and spitting puddles and puddles up. We have since again switched her formula after trying the Hypoallergenic Alimentum from Similac. We are back to the first formula we had her on. At 10 weeks she was diagnosed with Acid Reflux after her fourth doctor visit and me getting on the Internet and finding out what was wrong with my daughter in the first place. I took her in and handed her to the doctor and said she has acid reflux help. We have her an Zantac three times a day. She is three months old and is doing alot better. The crying spells are getting better they don't happen as often. I don't know if you tried a vibrator chair my daughter slept in it from the time she was two weeks until about 11 and now she sleeps in her bed. But sometimes we still let her sleep in the vibrator chair.|`|3d0951a58e04340f767df22f4ce2a625aa	hi, i don't have other suggestions than what the others have said, however my experience with my son was that he stopped ABRUPTLY. one day he was crying most of the day, the next he was happy and having naps during the day. it took me weeks to really believe it was over. I know it wont change your problem but i do feel for you. I know it is HARD. Take care|`|AA11107544	my babies stared about 6 weeks old and lasted until right after 3 months i guess... I switched her formula to enfamil for colic babies and within a week I saw a difference totally. she was a happy baby then!|`|SP2KK0ataa	My first daughter had colic and it went away gradually. It is a rough time for you. I understand. Just hang in there and it will all get better with time.|`|aDayS0Gxaa	Mine started at 3wks and went up to 3mo!! It was so sad to see my baby go through this. I would say gradually (unfortunately).|`|AA11016271	the only thing that would help my daughter's colic was putting her in her infant seat on top of the dryer and turning it on.  the vibration soothed her and the warmth seemed to help too.  good luck!  this too shall cease (eventually)|`|t0SoRfzTaa	Gradually.  My first son had colic and the dr. said it would be gone by 6 weeks.  It wasn't.  So then he said it would be gone by 3 months.  It wasn't  At about 5 to 5 1/2 months my baby started crying less and less at night and by 6 months it was gone.   It was a nightmare for a long time. Doctors were not very much help.
BMIW36XFaa	Once a daycare provider has "got so pissed", I wouldn't even want my child to be anywhere near that place again.  They could make life just as miserable for your child as they can to you.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	A public daycare is a public business. They can deny service to anyone. Are you changing providers or do you have different plans? Perhaps if you explained to her you are pulling your daughter out of daycare because you are moving/going to stay home with her/etc she may apologize for her outburst.|`|SgOVFseaaa	Where are you?|`|vohzTzkgaa	Well, you all were such great customers and that's why she's probably so upset to be losing you. You were completely correct in giving advance notice, but seriously even if she doesn't want to lose you guys and that's why she got pissed, that's no reason to have an outburst. She should've tried to keep your business by offering something or looking for a resolution. Obviously, I don't know why you are changing daycares or if it is that you won;t be using daycare anymore, but if the lady reacted that way, I don't think I would want my kid around her anyways.  Good Luck!|`|ExwQiJ2Haa	I took my son out of day care because i was not happy with how my son was being looked after and all the staff there where really pissed off with me and now when i see the staff in my local town they don't even look or say hello to me or my son. so if i where you i would pay no attention to them because daycare centre's are never happy if you take money away from them so if you can take your child out now and leave them to it. it's just sad that they cant be nice about your child leaving and give her a little party. but don't let them bully you. best of luck take care|`|RHSvbBquaa	If you are on ccms, then no. When you get gov. assistance to pay daycare costs, each of you (the director of daycare and you the parent) have to take certain steps to remove child from that daycare. If you are NOT on assistance then yes, the director is well within her rights to ask you to remove child immediately. While it really isn't nice of the director, it is her choice as director to make. Sorry!|`|8DAxlA9Eaa	unfortuantely its her business and she can do whatever she wants|`|qSmCA82Aaa	Honestly she was probly just upset bc of the fact that you did pay on time and that you have a good child, she just doesn't want to lose you,  However if she got that angry when she should have appreciated the notice its better yyour child doesn't go anymore, you don't want to take the chance of her being mean to your baby!|`|dmhmXQdGaa	Surely she is not alowed to do this. Did you sign a contract when your child first started? if so i would read the terms and conditions as to where you stand. If not then i'm afraid idon't know where you would stand on this...|`|5t92lIW9aa	that really sucks, but i don't think there's much you can do, besides do you really want your daughter there when the owner is all bent out of shape............|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Why are you taking her out and did you explain all this to the provider? Regardless she is acting very immature. And the only way to answer this is to look at your contract if you have one.|`|UxF5n9BNaa	Sorry that your daycare provider had to be this way. She is mad because you are taking your business else where. You have ever right to leave. I wouldn't take it so personal. But if your child does become unhappy before you leave the center then I would take legal action. hope everything works out!

Tu compra lo que desees ignora a esa gente, puedes comprar cosas basicas como pa?aleritos, camisitas, mamelucos, calcetines en colores blanco, amarillo, verde aqua, una bolsa de pa?ales de recien nacido, sus cremitas y productos de ba?o, una cosa que si te recomiendo es que compres pocas cosas de recien nacido porque crecen rapidisimo y los dejan en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, yo segun no iba a comprar mucho y mi bb tiene demasiada ropa de recien nacido jeje solo espero que si le quede y que le dure de perdida unos 3 meses, luego pasa que una puesta y ya ahi se qued...    Te comento que a mi me gustan mas las nenas, yo me moria por una, pues son mas tiernas y hay miles de cosas que ponerles de ropa, accesorios, las puedes peinar, ponerlas hermosas y a los nenes no hay mucha variedad, solo pantalon y shorcitos.

QecPJAzGaa	I was always told to talk to the doctor before you took any medication or anything along that line. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure. Plus read the back of the bottle.|`|btlxyHX3aa	I had a massive head cold a couple of weeks ago! Sneezing, plugged nose, then runny nose, watery eyes, I felt absolutely terrible! The doctor told me to use a warm cloth compress on my sinuses and forehead, put a humidifier in my bedroom, drink plenty of fluids, stay in bed, use a saline spray from the drug store (it is not medicated), and i could take Benedryl and it really helped! I asked about nasal sprays and the doctor mentioned that they tend to irritate your nasal more and work the opposite!|`|AA11340179	ask your doctor but i never touched that stuff|`|yYTpdANvaa	I just had my ob orientation today and my nurse said afrin|`|ClKtxmC2aa	Ask at the chemist. I certainly wouldn't take anything before 16 weeks pregnant even if they say its OK as so was Thalidomide once.   Afer then the baby is formed so if they say its OK then take it.  Alternatives,, Vick nasal salve for nasal congestion. Find natural remedies.
NgxSR2k3aa	if shes ready then let her do it. buy one of those little pottys so she can sit on it herself. so what if you have to help her take her clothes off|`|AA10906058	its natural for children to go through a stage of taking their clothes off, you daughter is learning to take off her diaper.  that is normal.    Since it has become troublesome to put her in the diaper, you can potty train.  Take her to the training seat every 2 hours, do not force her to go but encourage her when she does.  14 months is young to to start this process on average, but all children move at their own pace.

It can hurt baby and cause listeria and salmonella among other things in the baby that won't affect you at all.
9EVcTnUWaa	Yes mood swings are perfectly normal for pregnant women especially if this is your first pregnancy.  Remember that your hormones are changing and your body is releasing more than normal in order to support the baby during gestation.  When you give birth things will go back to normal.|`|rymbwVKXaa	I am 4 wks and cry all the time. It is normal. I cried all the way through my first pregnany. It was always at the stupid things too. Your husband should try to understand your going through all this and try to help with it sometimes. Get used to the crying it will happen when the baby is born too. So it will be you and the baby crying together! Just kidding. It seems like it will be forever but before you know it, the baby will be here and it will all be behind you.good luck.|`|0Ae1tqZpaa	yess!! im only 18 weeks pregnant . some times i cry over the stupidest things. .  and some times i feel like crying for no reason!|`|4e01f5e1daf5676e8376408fe13f4fbdaa	i get depressed a lot too. im 39 weeks and it still bothers me. im huge, i don't fit into my clothes anymore, i can't go out with my friends and do the same things. It's just a different lifestyle.. and it really does take some time to get used to. as far as your husband is concerned, just don't let the weight stay on after wards. he probably thinks it's cute now because it really is a beautiful process and it's you guys together growing in your belly but many women take advantage of that and don't work out after wards to lose the weight they gained.|`|WZ2cpoBMaa	 Yes it is normal, if you feel that way. When my older sister was pregnant, she was always cryings and somethings she was asking me if she is still beautiful. Please do not worry about it to much and pls enjoy and be happy.
cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	Absolutely not - formula and breastmilk provide all the liquids your child needs to thrive. Water just fills her little tummy with zero nutrition, making her less likely to fill up on the good stuff...|`|pXSKSS3daa	Nope, no water.    Giving water to a baby so young can actually do harm to her and cause water intoxication.

My baby doesn't like water she never has and she's 4 1/2 months now.    The doctor told me as long as they are drinking their formula their staying hydrated.    Also I went to a weaning class and the health visitor said its no imperative , shes maybe just not thirsty.    If your baby was thirsty then she would definitely take it. Don't worry, she probably will start taking it when shes starts solids as she will need and want it more.|`|uBy3cvseaa	my health visitor said yes you do,especially if her stools are hard,my son is 3 weeks and iv just stared giving him water just before his feed|`|DxbaEPbUaa	yes. the human body is 95% water and it needs to be replenished on a daily basis. babies lose water through sweat, urine, feces, crying and breathing. just an ounce or two is fine. it will keep her from getting constipated,|`|eUuFPJAFaa	No, not at the moment, if she was a summer baby she might as they can get a bit dehydrated.    If she shows signs of dehydration, i.e. hard stools, then offer her some cooled, boiled water - if she needs it she will take it, if not she'll refuse.    But in general, she shouldn't need it.|`|Kmrl0FX8aa	My pediatrician told me that a baby doesn't need water until they are on whole milk.

s6stLtvLaa	It is common for you to have bleeding during the first and part of the second trimester.  As long as your are not passing tissue then you should be just fine.  Usually once you hear the heartbeat your chances of a miscarriage decrease drastically.  If your doctor doesn't seem concerned then you shouldn't be (though I know from experience it is hard not to be concerned).  Just do what your doctor says, if you are still uncertain in the morning then ask them to do an ultrasound.  More than likely they will be happy to do it.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I only spotted but miscarried 3 weeks later. do not wait till tomorrow. demand a scan ASAP. you cant mess around with these sorts of things.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	usually if ur bleeding without cramps then its a good sign.   rest with yr feet up and try to relax, i know its difficult but try, and as u have been told go for a scan tmrw so they can see whats going on. good luck.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    bleeding in this time span - Means Threaned mis/c. Bed rest for you darling is a definite try keep off your feet and drink lots of fluids.  i had similar at 16 weeks and thats what they told me.    you should be okay.  God Bless x take it easy|`|75l2smfCaa	Did they do a pap or anything on you? I was 10 weeks and they did a pap and I bled quite a bit for the rest of the night. It was gone by the next day|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Bleeding is a bad sign, but until they do the US you cant tell    Good luck!|`|ETM57dBAaa	don;t get worked up because this can happen, but I would go to the Er so you feel better about it!  The last thing you need is stress!!  God Bless You.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	if they did anything with going in that area that could have made you bleed but having the heart beat and then a little bit later bleeding it shouldn't mean much
HjyUoM8eaa	you can try.  it will hurt though.  remember that there's much more blood volume in your genitals right now than when you are not pregnant, so it will probably hurt like a b***.  LOL.    seriously though, i have a high tolerance for pain and am currently 36 weeks and 5 days pregnant.  i can barely sit through eyebrow threading.  i did get a bikini wax at 18 weeks and it hurt!|`|ioZeveazaa	Yeah you can get a wax. I personally shave but if you do waxing..go ahead. Good luck!!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If you like infected hair follicles, sure why not.   Oh yeah, it's going to hurt a lot worse then it does when you're not pregnant.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	don't see why not?  unless the pain sends you into labour :P lol.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, it is safe to get waxed while you are pregnant. I work in a spa and we do this all of the time. I even asked my OB about it just to be sure he thought it was safe. He told me it is safer than shaving as far as infections go. Plus, who can shave that far along...it's like driving blind down there!    I get waxed regulary and have had no complications. I will tell you though that it hurts a whole heck of a lot more than normal due to all the increased blood flow! Sometimes that can even cause a bit of bruising. Make sure the person you go to specializes in waxing and is a licensed esthetician, not someone who just does waxing "on the side." Even better if you can get a referral from a friend.     Good luck with it. :)|`|msQqxMIbaa	Seriously.  Why would you do that?|`|HxdV815Caa	yes|`|FdQD8H3qaa	it's fine to but OUCH!!!!!!!  Who are you trying to impress????
2irmTjQ3aa	yes and eeww u just gave birth? why dont u get back in shape first?|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	My brother and sister are ten months apart    Yes you can get pregnant    Wait and see|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You might be pregnant in 12-14 days, not right now.  Take a test in 20 days.|`|6xHOa3tJaa	yes|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	yes . you are ever fertile after giving birth which is the reason they request you wait to engage in sex until after 6 weeks which you recieve your check up . and it is very dangerous to concieve right after having a child the out side of your body may heal but it takes months for the inside to heal|`|AA11842267	yes honey you sure can get pregnant easy its really easy after u have a baby to get pregnant the next time because you are so fertile u r suppose to wait longer than 3 weeks hope ya didnt have ruff sex ur insides r proberly rupsured i had a baby 4 weeks ago and im not having sex 4 a long time if u and eva otha woman that jus had a bay went through all the **** i did u wouldnt ever wanna have sex again i had a csection lost blood and some mo **** and im only 16 ......kids r fun but u need to wait a few more weeks to have sex again cause u r suppose to wait 6 weeks n e way ...|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yup, your the most fertile after giving birth|`|T8zPA3FJaa	yes you can.|`|28fNd725aa	yep you should could!  If you are breast feeding chances are less, but you are very fertile right now ... so be protected!!  Congrats on the new baby btw!!|`|AA11763588	You are very fertile after you give birth, and there is a reason the DR says refrain from sex for 6 weeks.    My children are 13 months apart because I was horny and didn't listen to my DR.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Yup, its actually really common for people to get pregnant as soon as they have a baby. Every woman in my family has gotten pregnant before their first turns one. I guess where your body has been through it before, it makes it that much easier to get pregnant. That's why doctors stress about getting on BC right after birth.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	yes its easier to get pregnant after giving birth because of your hormones|`|XEmYfHl2aa	Umm gee i dont know....WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT MORON.....  YES! YOU CAN|`|5f6XnInEaa	Why you are having sex 3 weeks after giving birth is beyond me.    Doctors say wait the six weeks for a reason, that reason being you risk infection from your un-healed cervix.    Yes, you could be pregnant.  It does not take a genius to know that unprotected sex can get you pregnant.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I do not think so. You should not be able to get pregnant during first 6 weeks, but dont bet on that. You still might. I had sex with my man 10 days after giving birth to our daughter, all is well and now 2 years later I smile about it, but if I told my OB/GYN about it back then, he would probably flip out :D They say no sex first 4-6 weeks after birth for health and safety reasons.|`|kDftsHXjaa	yES your most fertile after you give birth!!!!|`|ETM57dBAaa	YES!!!!|`|ynZVkBcdaa	i heard your not suppose to have sex until 6-9 weeks after you give birth i think its bcuz you can get pregnant fast or something like that i could be wrong.?|`|yrDqtazLaa	Yes you can, you are more fertile now than ever because you just had a baby. Watch out.|`|uXLFoE4Faa	its very possible you can get pregnant that soon after birth. I work in a daycare and we have had two moms that went in for their 6week post birth check up and they were pregnant!!|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	You are supposed to give your body at least 6 to 8 weeks to heal before having sex. Why wouldnt you allow your body to heal before having intercourse? I love sex just as much as the next person but this is the only body I will ever get.

"I just asked for a pen for goodness sakes"    Nothing wrong with being skinny,or bigger as long as your healthy,just ignore that.|`|tpvcJwfvaa	Sit down with her one on one and have a nice discussion about it.  Tell her how the things she is saying and does makes you feel.  If she's any kind of a friend, she'll listen and change what she is doing.|`|v1unVqYqaa	No, How long have you been friends?.... She is just being a jerk to you probably because of a better friend.  I wouldn't take that from her, and tell her like it is.  i would say you need to stop having a attitude and competition problem with me.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	must be pmsing for life.|`|esJpBtEdaa	dont sink to her levell  stop bein friends w/ her|`|nCFnFLCDaa	Just try to be the better person.|`|5cBmCVw3aa	No don't hate, she'll get whats coming to her. let karma take its toll.|`|vOPlkCRAaa	shes a *****.  stop talking to her|`|QGkBZFqWaa	You know, it's not really a big deal is it?  I'm VERY skinny and people call me annorexic even though I'm a pig.  If she's proud of being "bigger" let her be. Seriously, it's not a biggie. Ignore her I guess if you're annoyed?|`|oOMzcKITaa	**** the bigger person!  show her what a skinny grl can do  SHOW HER WHOS BOSS!|`|C90bta8Saa	Stay away from her. I would not want that negativity in my life|`|pbPe614Raa	just have everyone ignore her,cause odds are they dont like her doing this either.she will feel really stupid afterwards|`|FRyDXWwQaa	i feel like she's making a big deal out of nothing, so no don't retaliate, just reply calmly that you aren't going to let her treat you like **** anymore.|`|CfUuDEW9aa	tell her everything to her and tell her that if she doesnt stop then you wont be her friend and if shes fine with it i guess shes not a true friend after all :/|`|WaxI1K6faa	Do the same thing she is doing...be annoying! annoy the crap out of her then she probably tell you to stop and then tell her that she did it to you and it got really annoying.    hope i helped :)|`|CdBxhRcVaa	oh boy  well yelling at her only causes more drama. you should have just told her when she told you to speak up "i asked for a pen..you misunderstood me." and nothinng more.   and shes just being stupid and playing around when she says she bigger. and when your alone with her like at your house or something where she can be herself, say look, I dont like it when you..call me thin"...or whatever.  if she says it again at school, tell her to stop. if she doesnt, then ignore her. shes only doing it because she knows it bugs you and if you just completly ignore her, she'll get the message and quit|`|2yRZSTF1aa	To tell you the truth it doesn't sound like you should be friends anymore. I had a best friend since second grade, and now it's my senior year and we have grown apart alot (just in the past couple of months). He is very annoying now, shows off all the time, and lies. And while I could yell at him and make a fool of him and his lies I just decided to stop talking to him and ease my way apart from him. It will be hard but you can do it. If not things could get worse and she could start talking about you behind your back or who knows what. But then again maybe you just need to talk with her. Good luck and whatever the outcome just remember you have a whole life left for friends and family.|`|qOm71Iioaa	ummm... why would you be mad at your friend for not undersanding what you said????? Just tell her something like "you really need to stop listening to your ipod so loud, your practicly death" or something like that, she'll get the message. Also where I live being called skinny is considered a compliment, so I wouldn't complain.    You guys must live such happy lives if this is your big issues, just dont make such a big deal out of nothing :)|`|P2wY81DSaa	No just take a minute to cool of and talk to her.It will have a better ending than if you start yelling.Ask her whats going on.Confort her.Mabye it's not her, mabye it's something in her life.Don't ruin the friendship by getting like that too.|`|ZPPLvHDaaa	Stop being friends with her. She being an obnotious *****. And she wants attention. Just stop being friends with her and ingore her.|`|Eke5Ls6gaa	your friend sounds like she is dieing for attention! And if you confront her about it, she will only cause a scene! I would stop being her friend until she learned to treat you better!
fHjSonssaa	I had the same as you honey.  TERRIBLE HIP PAIN.  I could barely stand it some days.  The only things that brought even mild relieve were the pillow- one day a used a heating pad (very lacally only on the hip, and in short spurts)- and then don't be afraid of taking a bath.  I took a bath almost everyday during my pregnancy.  I just kept a thermometer in the bathtub with  me if I took a warmer bath.  It's if your temp goes to 102 or above- that's the concern.  So I just made sure that my temp stayed well below that.  You can still take a warm bath without over-doing it.  Also, even if you're really that scared of a warm bath, you can still take a cooler bath and the water taking on gravity will help relieve your hips.  Just wait it out- it can come and go- it did for me as you mentioned.  But you're almost to the point where it should slow down for good (within a few weeks)-  otherwise, Tylenol very ocassionally if the pain is that ridiculous is not a terrible thing.  I had to take a  couple times throughout my pregnancy due to terrible headaches- I just made sure I didn't take it often.  I wouldn't suggest a bath if it was going to hurt baby, as I was a very conservative person during pregnancy- however you do have to take care of yourself as well.  When the pain gets to a certain point, a little relief is OK.      Good luck- the pain WILL go away- I promise.    =)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it could be round ligament pain or sciatic nerve.  contact your career on what to do.  its best.    God Bless x|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If it is pain on the side of your hips it is most like piriformis/psoas muscle pain due to your hips stretching. There are some stretches you can do to help with this. This is also probably true if your problem happens more when you are laying on your side. For that you can try this:    http://www.bodyresults.com/E29090QPsoas....    If the pain is more in the back of your hip and going toward your leg it is most likely sciatic pain, and probably won't be relieved by stretching. You could try chiropractic care which I have found to be really helpful for myself.    Also, it's okay to take a warm bath as long as you don't start to feel overheated. I take a bath to ease my aches and pains nearly every day and my baby is just fine. Just don't take one with scalding hot water and you should be okay! Also, you could just fill the tub up enough that your legs and hips are covered if you are worried.    Good luck and feel better!|`|T8zPA3FJaa	sounds like your sciatic nerve. it runs from your lower back, through your hip, all the way down your leg. unfortunately theres not much that can be done. I had it a couple of weeks ago (im 12 weeks preg). I was in extreme pain too the exact same things you are going through now. my doctor gave me mersyndol forte, but it didn't help for the pain. seeing my brother who is a chiropractor helped a bit, with the adjustments.   But yeh i went through almost 3 weeks of excruciating pain. Stretching helps a little bit too - and i know how painful it is! But the only thing i could do it sit through it and hoped it would go away, thankfully it has subsided heaps now, and is merely a dull pain now.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	its common ...in an issue of the american baby magazine it says this...:  Hip Hip Hooray  hip pain is another common problem in pregnancy.  general hip pain can feel like a cramp pressure or aching in the hips or buttocks.  this discomfort is caused by the compression of the sciatic nerve as pregnancy hormones relax hip joints allowing the hip bones to spread and make room for the baby because the baby tends to lie more heavily to one side the pain is stronger in one hip.  you can ease the pressure by elevating your hips above the level of your chest.  a good way to do this is to kneel on all fours and rest your head and chest on a pillow....i do this all the tip...mine is always in the buttocks though and i know how you feel...it sucks and is very painful|`|AA11885437	Warm water in a bath or a heating pad will not hurt the baby and may give you some relief. I had bad pain in my hips/pelvic area too, and in my case my hip was actually out of place by quite a bit. It was not the sciatic nerve, although that is a common source of pain in pregnancy. In my case my doctor prescribed me PT twice a week, which I was eventually able to cut down to once a week, but it helped SO much. The therapist showed me stretches and exercises I could do at home to help keep my hip in place as well. I would talk to your doctor and ask about PT. It would be better to get treatment started now, rather than wait until it gets worse and then even PT might not be able to help. Good Luck!|`|jHuQjrzOaa	not that early all tho i did have sharp pain in my woo hoo   i'd say call your doc just in case...   don't worry to much tho...|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	I am currently 5 months pregnant and im having the same problems with my hips...I think its from the hips expanding to make room for the baby to come out BUT than again i could be wrong....What i did was take it easy even though i have 2 other children to take care of. Ive also tried the pillow between the legs thing and your right it doesnt work..lol...Ive taken Tylenol and it helps somewhat but the pain is still there...all i can say is tell your doctor about it and he may have something for you to take for it........Good Luck!|`|n5Sx4WwYaa	hey well i know exactly what you are feeling and i believe its your static nerve im sure you have heard that by now but i also wanted to tell you that if you make sure and not to have the water and your temp raise over 98 then you should be fine to take a bath and well i also wanted to add that i have been having what you are going through i was recently on a very long road trip that ended in a long flight and if you have been sitting for long periods of time that is what is causing it so my advice is  i know it hurt s but you have to move and readjust but good luck and hope you feel better :)|`|JvZY0ZS4aa	I had this in the last month of my second baby and now around the same time as you (actually, since about 18 weeks) in my third pregnancy. I've been very inactive during this pregnancy because of this. The only thing that seems to help me is to get as much rest (literally lying down) as much as possible - assuming you can find a comfortable position to lay down in!    I found an article that explained it exactly and offered some suggestions and answers. Perhaps you'll relate and find some solutions? Here's the article:  http://www.plus-size-pregnancy.org/pubic...

Xrwvu5Uraa	okay well yes you should tell him  and he should of known you were pregnant in the first place  this is going to make your situation a little harder.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    im sorry that this has happened to you darling. but  its completely up to you.  but if you feel you must share with him. Then do tell him.   So he knows.    God bless x|`|PKyzcW7Faa	Why should you, does it matter that he needs to know. Or will it make things better. I really don't see the point in telling him. Sorry if I am coming too strong but to me it shouldn't matter. take care and sorry for you loss.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	Really it's up to you. As you miscarried I don't think it makes too much difference if you tell him or not. It would just come down to how you feel within yourself. I don't think it would change anything.|`|G02vO6Jwaa	yes you should definitely tell him. one of his miracles has died.|`|DzGKfdKnaa	Absolutely.    This will be disaster prevention for him (and hopefully yourself) in the future.    I mean what if he does it again and the next one stays?|`|yj5VFzyvaa	junior high?     wow.    and no...there is no point to now :/|`|97JwSvUzaa	Honestly, when it happened to me I didn't. I didn't feel like it would help me any to tell him and I really didn't feel like he would even care. So, I would say that if it will help you, then yes, tell him. However, if you aren't going to get the support that you need from him to move on from this, I wouldn't. I think it will just open you up to a lot of emotional pain.
fG7LmB7Kaa	Found your answer on www.webmd.com    This medication should be used only when clearly needed during pregnancy. It is not recommended for use for long periods or in high doses near the expected delivery date because of the potential for harm to an unborn baby. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor|`|AGcwdZGmaa	wow yeah it bad you should not take it your dr is an idiot go to the hospital and they will fix it remember to make sure they know your pregnant and a kidney infection is bad too   DO NOT TAKE THE VICODIN|`|vAYPTTZEaa	when i was 32 weeks my doctor prescribed me norco for severe headaches/migraines. only if the good out weighs the bad is it ok to take. there are alot of women who take pain medication through out their whole pregnancy due to severe pain. just dont take it if not needed|`|X2G8EHBlaa	yes it is bad for the baby your not supposed to take any pain medication like that|`|XCueIYnYaa	the doctor wouldnt give it to you if it wasnt safe. just dont over take it.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Vicodin is fine. My OB prescribed it for me for back pain with  1.|`|hG8tLBSMaa	of course it will hurt baby... just like alcohol will... did your dr know you are pregnant at the time he prescribed the medication?|`|T5avxqUZaa	i would assume that vicodin is NOT okay to take while pregnant ask your doctor|`|jgtfWjE4aa	you should have told the dr that you were pregnant before he ever prescribed it.    and if you haven't done that yet i hope you were smart and didn't take any of it yet.    call your dr!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I was in a car accident and broke my leg when I was 23 weeks. The Dr prescribed me Vicodin. I too was worried, but he assured me that it was safe to take. I finally had to take it, I was in so much pain. Everything was fine. He was born perfectly healthy. Just remember that your Dr will not give you something that isn't safe. Medications are safe to take as long as you take them exactly as directed and only when you truly need it. Abusing them for an extended period of time, is when there is a problem. The only side effects to the baby that have been reported is withdraw symptoms when the mother took it regularly prior to delivery. And a possible degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, when the mother took higher doses shortly before delivery. Take is as directed and it will be fine.    ADDED: Some of the people are just telling you to not to take this medication bc you said the word  "VICODIN" They should do some research before they start spouting off. Vicodin is perfectly safe to take as long as you don't abuse it. Actually Vicodin is one of the safer pain medications to take..there is no reason you should have to suffer if you are in pain. Cranberry Juice does not cure a kidney infection and it certainly doesn't ease the pain.|`|ae73541672d371e87ebedfb3fa8b29f0aa	DO NOT TAKE THE VICODIN,,,go to the store and get some cranberry juice, it is a absolute cure for kidney infections, it clears out the kidneys, and it is also healthy for baby.  I always drink this if there is any sign of an infection.  you should drink at least one 8 oz glass a day, also drink plenty of water, and milk..stay away from soda pop it will cause many problems  Good luck to you.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Some of these people need to do their research.  Vicodin is considered one of the "safer" meds to take.  I am assuming your doctor knew you were pregnant.  Obviously you don't want to overdo it, and you should only take it when needed.  I was prescribed Vicodin when I had my baby, to help with the pain, even though I was breastfeeding.  I was told to take it when needed for pain, and not to take it if I could manage the pain with Ibuprofin.  You can also take Tylenol with Codeine instead.|`|V3UmvkVOaa	I was in the same situation as you, just a bit further along in my pregnancy (I'm due March 7th), and the pain from the kidney infection was staggering (obviously you know!). My doctor prescribed 20 vicodin at the highest dosage, 10 mg. Of course, I had the same question as you, and my doctor reassured me that the baby would not be affected. So far, my baby is doing perfectly, a textbook pregnancy, and I trust my doctor 110%. He delivered me over 25 years ago, and with that much experience, I'm sure he knows what's best for my unborn son. Talk with your doctor if you have doubts of course (I even discussed it with my husband, who is a nurse). Just make sure your doctor knows you're pregnant, take the pills as prescribed, and you should be just fine. Sorry about the kidney infection, but congrats on your new edition!
7rJrOb7eaa	Here's the link to their online detailed instructions. Look about halfway down the page and find this(has pictures:  Please follow these steps to adjust the Co-Sleeper? bassinet height from 18"- 24":      Mattress height of 18":  If your mattress height from the floor to the top of your mattress is 18", insert the plastic connectors into the lowest receivers on both sides.    Lock the top bar by pulling up on the center of the bar.    Once the top bar is locked, lock the bottom support bar by pushing down on the center of the bar. You can do this with your hand or foot.    Assemble the support bars and hangers by inserting the long bars into the lower female receiver of the hanger. Make sure the metal button clicks into the plastic hanger. Connect the long bars into each side of the short bar. (There should be a total of 4 Hangers, 3 Long Bars with metal buttons, and 2 Connector Bars)      Attach the support bars and hangers to the Co-Sleeper? bassinet by placing the hanger on the nylon bar and rotating it into position. (Please note the correct placement of where the hangers need to be positioned are located on the unit)     The lowering bar is now at 18". Please continue following the set up procedures on Step 8.     Mattress height of 20":   If your mattress height from the floor to the top of your mattress is 20", follow the previous Step 1 and Step 2.   Add the 2" increment on each leg to raise the Co-Sleeper? bassinet to 20".    The lowering bar is now at 20". Please continue following the set up procedures on Step 8.     Mattress height of 22":  If your mattress height from the floor to the top of your mattress is 22", insert the plastic connectors into the upper receivers on both sides.    Lock the top bar by pulling up on the center of the bar.    Once the top bar is locked, lock the bottom support bar by pushing down on the center of the bar. You can do this with your hand or foot.    Assemble the support bars and hangers by inserting the long bars into the upper female receiver of the hanger. Make sure the metal button clicks into the plastic hanger. Connnect the long bars into each side of the short bar. (There should be a total of 4 Hangers, 3 Long Bars with metal buttons, and 2 Connector Bars)      Attach the support bars and hangers to the Co-Sleeper? bassinet by placing the hanger on the nylon bar and rotating it into position. (Please note the correct placement of where the hangers need to be positioned are located on the unit)     The lowering bar is now at 22". Please continue following the set up procedures on Step 8.     Mattress height of 24":   If your mattress height from the floor to the top of your mattress is 24", follow the previous Step 1 and Step 2.   Add the 2" increment on each leg to raise the Co-Sleeper? bassinet to 24".    The lowering bar is now at 24". Please continue following the set up procedures on Step 8.   Remove the liner from the plastic bag and lay the liner over the Co-Sleeper? bassinet frame with the long flap over the lowering bar. Pull the back corners over the frame. Secure the liner into place with the snaps on all corners. (Please note: If the adult mattress is 18"- 20" unzip the zipper that runs horizontally along the lower part of the liner to lower the "adjustable nest" to rest on the support bars. Then, unzip the two vertical zippers that are located on the inside of the front corners of the liner.)         Secure the front lower corner flaps of the liner to the velcro patches found on the front and sides of the nylon panel.     Make sure the over hanging fabric covers the corner flaps and secure the front over hanging fabric to the velcro patches found on the lower nylon panel of the Co-Sleeper? bassinet.     Lay the mattress on top of the liner and connect the velcro on the bottom of the mattress to the support bars by feeding the velcro strap down through one slit of the fabric liner around the metal support bar, then back up through the other slit in the fabric liner, and finally securing the velcro on the mattress. Repeat this step all four sides of the mattress.        Attach the strap & plate from your bed and connect it to the Co-Sleeper? bassinet through the belt loop located on the side of the unit. (Please see instructions on page 4 of how to attach the strap & plate to the adult bed)    The unit is now in Co-Sleeper? bassinet position.   Before putting your infant into the unit, check the following to make sure the unit is in the proper Co-Sleeper? bassinet position:    Make sure all the top bars and the bottom support bars are locked.   Double check to make sure the mattress is secured to the support bars.    Hope this helps! I could use 10 points!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I haven't used mine for ages, but as I recall there were feet that snapped on to make it taller.
f5sOz2g9aa	Your odds are very very high you will get pregnant. Lets just be real for a moment. Your a teenager and your box is very tight, for a guy this means very intense stimulation. You don' t have much experience, lets face it you don't know what you are doing other than it feels good. If you switch your body into the right position your guy will come in one or two strokes. It will happen so fast. Your boyfriend is young too? No experience he would not know what happened till it is over.    For the scientific take whats happen as you are having sex more and more of your brain gets turned off, that is fear, anxiety, pain and other parts get more and more deactivated the more turned on you get. At the same time you will be feeling more and more pleasure. As a guy gets close to orgasm it becomes very hard to pull out in time. For him it feels extremely good to come deep inside you. Your guy probably had a little throb and shot a little bit in you.  O yea as a girl you get much more horny when your ovulating. Yep that's when you will want him the most. You may have heard of other girls getting knock up the first time they put out, this is the reason and likely what has happened to you.  I will put it this way going bare back with guy within 6 months you will be pregnant I guarantee it!   You have to use birth control if you do not want to get pregnant but it's probably too late for you unless you get an abortion. Actually with experience you will know you can't bareback long without a guy coming in you. That just the way it is.|`|j73bqzRAaa	you should go  to a clinc or your gyn right away  if u plan on not  having a baby   but take a pregnacy test and take 2 not one just to be sure it only takes one time to get pregnat and pre *** will work  ot get a  test asap|`|7xit1ogxaa	It depends on if you are ovulating right now. Anytime you have unprotected sex you run the risk of becoming pregnant or contracting STDs. Take a test if you miss a period.|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	There is always a chance you could become pregnant, now if you're asking exactly how likely it is I can't tell you. But even on the first time you can get pregnant, it doesn't matter.|`|dlYeDlu2aa	Don't ever have unprotected sex.   The 'pull out' trick won't work.  Pre-ejaculation can get you pregnant.  You should always use a condom.  But, if you're lucky the ejaculation won't get you pregnant.       Wait a little then take a test.  Hopefully I helped.|`|f32dJYsoaa	noone can give you odds on your possible pregnancy this is not a horserace however i can tell you that it is likely that if you are experiencing an irregular period that you could be pregnany. This isnt positive and taking a home pregnancy test would probably be advised. Either way however i must tell you that it is ill advised for a person of your age to be having unprotected sex and i believe that if you are not you should just be thankful and remember this moment and use it as a reminder to never make that mistake again until you are truly ready to have a child|`|AA11005831	how irregular do you mean?  if it's been well over a month; there are newer tests which can detect if you're pregnant earlier.
D3RCNSGiaa	You didn't have a miscarriage, you had a stillborn.  A blood clot is a likely possibility, but if that was true you would now be on blood thinners (i.e. Heparin or Coumadin).  I know this because it happened to me.  Did they do an autopsy?  Did you have a funeral or burial for your precious baby?  I ask because closure is very important.  Don't blame yourself.  I visit my son's grave every other day or so, it really helps.  If you need anything at all, please email me.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I am not sre how i can help you but i just wanted to say i am deeply sorry for your loss. I am sending hug vibes your way.|`|PKyzcW7Faa	I am sorry for your loss.   But I wouldn' t know how to help you. Get a second opinion.|`|7xit1ogxaa	I'm sorry for your loss. A stillbirth can be caused by many different things. Did she run any tests to find out what caused your loss? If you want you can always get a second opinion.|`|VClxXNs3aa	a girl I worked with had a stillbirth at 7 months, and she was told that the umbilical cord got pinched......  I dont think it would be the unisom, I took it during my first pregnancy to help with nausea and nothing bad happened... I'm sorry.
9Ng5sqpnaa	Sunny, you are spot on... adoptees and first mothers have nothing to gain here but discussion and understanding from others who have shared a similar experience. We lost. We lost our mothers and/or our babies. PAPs and APs really are the only ones who have something to gain when you look at it this way - even if it only means they are able to better understand their adopted children.    ....and by the way - me thinks our new member "Oh Yeah" is our own dear ollie trolling with a new persona.|`|JP04HX6maa	Maybe they think we're trying to speak directly for their children when we generalize loss?    That's just a guess on my part - I know some APs have contacted me through e-mail or on some other forums to tell me that it can actually come across as conscending at times...    I realize that we want to prepare them to be the best, most possibly receptive adoptive parents they can be, but we don't need to be shoving it down their throats.    We don't actually know their children better than they do. We know how their children MAY feel and we all know they should be better prepared as adoptive parents for the issues that MAY come up in adoptive parenting, but there is no guarantee and at the end of it all, this is simply what we do: we make them aware.    I understand what you are saying, Sunny, because I know adoption education is incredibly important, but I really feel I should state this: knowing how their children may feel and knowing how they children do presently feel are two different things.    Oh Yeah: "What's in it for you? An opportunity to pretend you all are victims and feel sorry for yourselves. That pretty much sums it up."    You just registered today and have your IM option off. Coward. At least have the decency to keep your IM on.    "And it is almost worse than AP or PAPs trying to gain babies because you all wallow in self-pity so much at times it is sickening; considering what options could have been worse for you and your lives."    You ASSUME we would have had worse lives. That is feeding into the adoption machine: saying we would have had worse lives if we hadn't been adopted because you can't face the possibility that our bparents might have actually been able to raise us decently.    Also, adoption is not about the P/APs gaining families. That is often perceived as adoption being more about what the P/APs want - the "availibility" of orphans vs. non actual orphans.  It is not about them considering what "available" babies are overseas. It is about the kids over there who need homes.    ETA: Where did I say that my adoptive life was horrible? Where have I said that my parents were horrible? Where have I said that my adoptive culture was horrible? Please point that out, I'd like to know.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	The only ones I see whining are the ones who are telling us we are ungrateful basturds for telling our truths.      I come here to give my experiences, and learn from other's experiences, too.      I have learned how much work needs to be done as far as changing perceptions of adoption.      Ive gained a few things. Ive gained satisfaction knowing Ive helped someone see how being open can help their child, how allowing their child to grieve their losses is a healthy thing. Ive gained satisfaction knowing Ive given women links to site that dispel the myths of adoption, and show them that they ARE being coerced. Ive gained knowledge about our foster care system, and how it needs reform. Ive gained knowledge from the few a p's here who DO understand how adoption can affect kids, and who do everything right.     Ive also gained a healthy appreciation for Advil, for when I feel as if Im banging my head against my laptop, and a greater appreciation for my sanity, and the edit/delete/block link. There are a few here who aren't in touch with either.|`|HmkCFddAaa	What's in it for the adoptees well if they are willing to have an open mind and not be so cynical maybe they could realize that their perception of adoption isn't the only one.  Maybe they would also realize that there is always gonna be a need for adoption and that not all women who get pregnate should keep their baby.    Love my dogz you hit the nail on the head.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Maybe you don't gain anything for yourselves from sharing your experiences directly...     BUT if adoptee's never spoke out then things would remain the same for the next generation. For starters I possibly wouldn't know how some things could affect my kids relating to their adoption and miss the signs.     By speaking out, there are things that adoptee's have gained from it,(In my state at least.)     Records would remain closed because no one would know adoptee's actually felt a gaping hole in their lives because of it.    No open adoptions would happen at all. It would still all be closed.     Current changes going through would hold no weight at all if adoptee's never shared their feelings or experiences.    "Oh Yeah"- Starting reading more of Mei-lings answers will ya, she's got lots to share and her information is helpful to lots of people here...she isn't a whinger so leave her alone...|`|RKcwfrGOaa	I do gain things here.  This evening, for example, I gained an appreciation for dumb luck.  Both my natural parents and my ap's were pretty respectable people.  Apparently, not everyone is blessed with a decent upbringing.  Oh Yeah.    Oh Yeah: I wasn't talkin' about other adoptees.  I was talkin' about folks complain' about other adoptees.  Like maybe I'm glad I wasn't raised in your house.|`|yu7gY5pBaa	They get to have fun at the whine and cheese party !|`|rAEkgvsXaa	Sunny, you should take a poll.  I bet the number of people that think of adoptees are "whiners" equal the number of people that think fmoms are "crackwhores" and APs are "baby snatchers".      Its sad that Y/A has become a mudslinging venue.    Personally I think you guys are gaining more than you think.   May not seem like it at times but Im sure you have educated a lot of people here or at least given people food for thought.  Its unfortunate that the rude vocal ones stand out, but you never know how many lurkers have been here and read what you guys are saying and have change or modified their thinking about adoption.    As for me, Im never going to wish I didnt adopt my children, that would be an all out rejection of them and never in a million years would I do that.  I don't go for hyphotheticals either, so I won't engage in "what ifs".  However a lot of my thinking about adoption has change and I am more sensitive about feelings of adoptees and fparents, especially here on Y/A.  Some things I have learnt here are:    - put childrens wants and needs first  - give a home to a child that needs it  - never adopt new borns   - learn as much as you can about adoption before proceeding to adopt  - support (and even encourage) your childrens desire to search for their first family  - that their birthfamily is part of them and always will be  - understand that adoptees can love everyone if they so choose  - understand that each adoptee is an individual and have individual feelings about adoption and their own personal situation.  -give your children unconditional support.    I could go on of course, but this answer would be too long.    Don't despair, some people are listening - isnt that a gain?|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	I think as an adoptive parent I do get quite a bit of wisdom to aid in raising my children.  I also get some grief, but that is only from a few folks!    Why do sexual abuse survivors go on to tell their stories?  To be part of the solution to stop it from happening to others.  This may be the same as adoptees.  Perhaps being part of this question and answer board gives them a voice and the ability to help others...not necessarily ME as an adoptive parent, but the benefits truly go to MY CHILDREN, so you are here to help and educate for future adopted generations, and perhaps give people something to think about before they begin their process.    I also think the adoptees on this forum have a bit of community, and must get something out of coming here, even if it is to find more people who feel the same way you to to support one another.    But yeah, I am here to learn, to give opinions on what I can, but mostly I feel it is for my children.  At least that is what I tell myself!|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	Obviously we have a sick need to see pwecious baybeez tormented at the hands of their evil crack-addicted natural mothers.  Why else would we want to keep families together?    I mean really, keeping families together.  The very idea of children staying with their families when those families are poor or the parents aren't married--who do we think we are?  Don't we realize these women must be punished and virtuous infertile people must be rewarded?  [/snark]|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Speaking your truth, and not allowing people to shut you up or treat you like a child.  Just guessin'.|`|q7W1SSgsaa	If a person had a particularly bad experience with something, they may form an opinion on that matter based only and solely on that experience.  Through bitterness, people can often form a one eyed view of something and wish to colour it that way for others.  They may gain some 'satisfaction' from ruining a possibly positive experience for others due to their own negative experience.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	I think that what is "in it" for adoptees is getting to have their opinions heard.  I don't know that society as a whole listens to the truths of adoption and I would imagine that would be frustrating.    I might be totally wrong.  Just my observations.|`|BTuFtui3aa	Um... what does ANYONE gain from answering and asking here? I would imagine it depends on the individual; you seem to expect a group answer, and while I can't speak as one of the group myself, I don't think that's possible. People have different motives.    But I'm going to be blunt. If you got NOTHING out of it, you wouldn't bother. (General "you," not "you" meaning Sunny, or even "you" meaning adoptees.) It's not like Yahoo is required for survival. What a person gets out of it may range from a feeling of helpfulness to sick fascination or anything in between... but if you didn't have ANY reason or feel ANY gain, I'm sure we're all smart enough to come up with alternate ways to occupy our time, whether or not we're adopted.    Seeing as adoptees are human and all, I'm guessing they've each got their own individual opinions. I don't think there's a group adoptee answer, any more than there's a group male answer, or a group working mother answer. Adoptees do each have separate brains.    I wouldn't speak for what any specific individual gets out of it. But there must be something, or that individual just... wouldn't. The fact an adoptee bothers being here suggests he/she DOES personally get some kind of mental or emotional benefit. I mean, an adoptee COULD just stop clicking on the Yahoo page, right?|`|2f90c73d8a7dab5b24328e77d6202a74aa	These types of questions only fuel the separation game more and more in this forum..............I'll just leave it be.........|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Saving another child from an ominous fate.

Uy8ntukjaa	You should be able to start trying after 6 weeks. Many women have healthy babies after they miscarry.

Otherwise, it may risk another miscarriage|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I am sorry for your loss. You need to follow your doctors advice even though you want to start right away to try getting pregnant,        That six weeks the doctor wants you to wait is for your body to heal from the miscarriage. To be healthy for when you do get pregnant.        Of course you would have a healthy baby if you got pregnant right away but as I said your body is going to suffer.  Be sure to take your prenatal vitamins (free at Meijers now) and eat properly.  Your husband will understand and love you one way or the other.|`|h4R4Txjvaa	Yes it is possible to have a healthy baby after a miscarriage but normally a miscarriage is cause by a problem in the body so you would need to check that out and It depends on your body, the next time you ovulate to be exact....|`|7xit1ogxaa	I'm sorry for your loss. It would be best to wait until you have at least one period. This will give your uterus and your heart time to heal. Take care.
TvO3eVIMaa	I would not use suppositories unless directed to by your pediatritian, especially that often or else she may always need them to poo. I didnt think breastfed babies had these kind of problems, but i could be wrong. at about 2 months my son really was constipated with hard pellets and i gave him 1 ounce of apple juice, he is now 4 months and i no longer give it to him, he regulated on his own...i've also heard karo syrup works but did not work with my son, definatly talk to your pedi, good luck!|`|yfcJwQr8aa	If you think you shouldnt be giving supositories that often talk to a doctor.  I did have to use them on my daughter but only because she was EXTREMELY Constipated.  If she is not constipated dont use them. IF you are worried about how often she poops, take her to a dr.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	DONT use suppositroies........ My son poops once a week.

If the doctor recommends these things of course, if not then, go with what he tells you, but the suppositories cannot be good for her...def call the doctor though!!|`|cjqKMjWnaa	i have a 10 month hold who started getting mildly constipated when i first started her on solid foods.  sometimes she wouldn't poop for 3-4 days.  i was worried, but my pediatrician told me not to worry about constipation until they haven't pooped for 10 days.    i would talk to your pediatrician to find out specific instructions for your baby ... but i also would stop using the suppositories until you've talked to a medical professional (unless you've been instructed by your doctor to use them already).
a5hNA3Kxaa	If you like her, yes, just be like "Do you have any plans this weekend?" if shes says no say "Oh well I wanted to see if you wanted to go to movie or something" or what ever you wanna do with her, up to you.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Yup! Something casual though. If you are talking gf material, I think it could get there eventually...but if all you are looking for is friendship, most definitely. :D You guys sound like A good match|`|ySKK7lCyaa	yeah you should. (:|`|iG6ksSpHaa	If you like her yes! I think she might like you if she texted you all day. If you have a lot in common it would be most likely fun for both of you. If your not completely comfortable then maybe go out with some of friends yours or her friends at first...|`|h4R4Txjvaa	Yeah! Totally! It's super simple and you could become friends, best friends or MORE! GO FOR IT! There is no reason not to!|`|PsP5adQ0aa	that sounds like a good idea but don't put your heart on the line, you don't want to get hurt, have fun and enjoy each others company. :)|`|Ukm5lvjmaa	absolutely,give her a nice day|`|v05RzzCEaa	aw yeah! go for it =)  good luck!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You just started talking,I would ask her out as friends,see how that goes. You want to make sure you have chemistry before taking the plunge.|`|VyuseWb2aa	Yeah, you should have already! It would really cheer her up...
0iTXlLKsaa	There will not be any complication for first time. But there will be an problem after that. Better to consult your Doctor right away.|`|bcZSIphUaa	Blood type doesn't matter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	The fact that you are negative and the baby potentially would be positive could cause a complication after the baby is conceived.  Your doctor will discuss it with you and what can be done about it when you become pregnant.|`|QFf9phAmaa	O+ve group is suitable to all group.there will be no problem.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	If you conceive, your doctor will discuss the RH factor with you and its complications and concerns.|`|Wz9tSKTaaa	Those blood types shouldn't make it more difficult to conceive, but as your husband is positive, it may be that your baby will be positive as well, and cause you, as a negative type, to produce antibodies against his/her blood. This would be a minute risk for your first child, but would build up to a significant reaction if you had a second or third positive child, possibly causing a miscarriage.    The doctor will probably give you an injection early on in any pregnancy to control your body's reaction. That will make it a non-problem.
Xnr5Y7Coaa	If your periods are regular then the ovulation calendar should be accurate. If you had sex today that sperm won't last past 72 hours or so. Saying that I think you can figure out that that sperm will not make it to the 7th.    This is just my personal opinion though, I'm sure there is a science behind all this calculation method.|`|xJYsGJOCaa	I would just try again on the 7th, because five days is a big difference for an ovulation circulation|`|wBpennsMaa	You can get pregnant anytime having sex, even if its protected.
Coc593Ikaa	You are not responsible for anything with regards to the shower itself. You do need to answer all their questions of you in a timely manner. You may need to provide addresses or such. Try to be easy to plan for! Then get your hostesses a nice "thank you" gift.|`|LiPoEBenaa	I just had mine saturday and the only thing you are truly responsible for is showing up. I did get my mom (the host) a gift card to get her mani/pedi done in appreciation for all she did to get the shower together. Have fun and I hope you get everything you need!|`|kj1md6t0aa	Just let them know who you want to invite (if you are supposed to know and it's not supposed to be a surprise) .. otherwise, relax and enjoy whatever they have ready for ya :)|`|J3TRJPIwaa	providing a guest list, any registry information, and showing up!|`|dBdQB4KHaa	Most cases you are only responsible for bing there. But ask if you can bring something that will help reassure you and make it look like you are trying at the same time. Congratulations!!|`|9op65iQVaa	absolutely nothing.  Look beautiful and be greatful.  Ask them in advance if there is anything you can do to help?  and at that point you might get their input to chip in or butt out.  Have fun and good luck.
Fq7FHQ44aa	u might be pregnant. :) this can be implantation cramps! wait for couple of weeks before u take hpt, or u can go to a doc for blood test if u want immidiate results!|`|IBOcGSGlaa	it definitely can be that you are pregnant and i wish you luck.. i have been trying as well but havent been so lucky!  but try to relax yourself and wait a little bit longer to see if your period comes if not take a hpt or go to the doc to be sure...  good luck hun!|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It is really hard to say.

7CoVXfA1aa	Not about not wanting to hug people, that should never be forced on a child. She should hopefully grow out of the shyness though. The line between shy and rude when children don't acknowledge someone talking to them (even to say hello or goodbye) is a very fine one. She will have to learn to communicate with others at some stage and know that others may find it rude. Perhaps you can talk to her about greeting people, let her know that you'll do it together and wont go off and leave her. Make sure people are giving her the space she needs and give her time to come out of her shell. Perhaps you can tell her how it makes people feel when she doesn't acknowledge them. Becoming upset at her for this behaviour will just make her less likely to respond in these situations (will put lots of pressure on her) as will your brother saying she doesn't have any manners.  Hopefully as she gets older and more confident this behaviour will disappear. If it doesn't, you may need to see a professional about it (usually only for extreme cases where you can't seem to cure her shyness, I'd say she'll probably just grow out of it).  Good luck :-)|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	she need more displin|`|ggfE4rlvaa	She's got stranger anxiety. Maybe she just gets overwhelmed by a bunch of people around her all at once. Or she's just a shy kid. I'm sure this is very normal as my 3-year-old does it too. She'll eventually get over it. Best thing you can do is to talk to her before you go somewhere, and explain exactly what's going to happen, so she's not blind-sided by a bunch of people. Or even just a couple people she may not know very well. I don't think it's rude, after-all she's not being obnoxious or mean. It's hard to find a kid who won't talk or do anything "rude". You should definitely work on it with her though, and she will eventually get over it. Do "practices" with her about certain situations. Such as: going to your brother's house. Or after you leave some place, ask her why she was behaving like that, and get to the bottom of it. Work from there. Best of luck!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	You shouldn't make her hug people if she doesn't want to.  Forcing her will just make it more uncomfortable for her, so you are basically making her want to do it less and less|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	A hug means nothing at all if you force someone to do it.  Be thankful you are the one she loves.|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	Just because she's little and cute doesn't mean that she isn't a real person with real feelings.    She's showing symptoms of anxiety attacks in the presence of other people, and you are her "security blanket".  Having her security blanket harass her to do that about which she is so anxious isn't going to help her overcome this anxiety.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Your brother is the one with no manners. It is obvious that she is shy around other people. Maybe she doesn't like to be surrounded by a ton of people, try one person at a time, and have them spend time with her.|`|tLXD3yOWaa	no offense but I think that your brother was out of line for saying that. she is just a shy little girl and she will eventually come out of her shell. my niece is the same way but once she gets to know someone she will be herself around them...forcing her to do things won't help it will just upset her more. I think that you should just have her interact with more people other than yourself.|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	You should not be upset. She's shy, she'll eventually grow out of it, even a little bit. Even though the no "hello" or "goodbye" situation is unusual (if she's seen her relatives many times), it is best not to force her. Maybe sometimes, you could hold her hand when she's sitting on your lap and wave it to people. If small amounts of people pay attention to her, maybe she will come to understand that it's not a very bad thing. Manners at 5 years old? Even an 8 year old is still learning proper etiquette and manners! And I don't mean this in a rude way, but be thankful (as said above) that she's always with you. =D|`|pJpk1aXFaa	thats normal. i have a 4 year old niece the same way. if we are somewhere she will stick to me or something, but if she gets to know each individual person, shes better.  dont force anything on anyone. im in my 20s and still a bit shy around strangers
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	The coach couldn't give you a write up for listening to your body and slowing down. If she tried you would have easily gotten it dismissed. This coach needs to be fired for encouraging teenagers to do permanent damage to their bodies. I'd go to the principal. One of my instructors (massage school) had a client who was a star soccer player on her high school team. Well, she developed shin splints (where the muscle actually begins to tear away from the bone), his recommendation was for her to relax on her training and take a few weeks off to heal. She didn't and her coach (of course wanting to win) encouraged her to go against the recommendation. The shin got worse to the point where she wasn't able to walk after practice or a game and my instructor finally told her parents he would turn them over to DHS for not protecting their child if they didn't make her stop and heal. Moral of the story, listen to your body telling you to slow down and ignore foolish coaches who don't have the qualifications to be coaching in the first place.   You probably have runner's knee. Use ice often, at least three times per day. Cut back on your running and try using an elliptical machine, swimming or other low/no impact exercise to maintain your cardiovascular health while you heal. Ease back into running after a couple weeks off and use an IT Band support. This is a strap that goes just under the knee and you can find one at Wal Mart or any sports store.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Absolutely not!!  While I can bike in shorts, in -20 weather, there aren't many people who can.    Your track coach needs to be reported to he principal, nurse and, the doctor.  For what the coach had you do.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	Discuss this matter with your school counselor. She/He will know best how to proceed and will find out if the coach overstepped his bounds.     Unless you are excused for medical reasons, there may not be anything you can do. However, if an injury occurred while at school, there may be a liability issue at stake.     I strongly urge you to seek counsel at school before doing anything further.|`|RESEYeVlaa	Just refuse to run next time especially if your knee is that bad.    if the coach has a problem with it thats their problem.|`|d67ULZQ6aa	No! I don't think that's fair at all. No one can make you do anything you don't want to do unless they are your parents. If I were you I would have told her no. Because even if she wrote you up I bet your parents would have been really mad. I've gotten written up before for walking out of class to use the bathroom because the teacher ignored me and woulnd't let me go. My mom went to the school and fussed at them and they got the write off taken off my record. And I'm sure the same would have happened with you. You should talk to you parents or school consulor, that was wrong about what the coach did, you should seriously have something done. And for next time, don't feel threatened of obligated to do something because she says shes going to write you up. Because if you are in the right 99% of the time you will end up in top.
VhLnzDYgaa	your mother has seen you naked.  so i dont think she will really care what you get arroused by,  my mom was the one telling me to do stuff by myself instead of having sex, now that was wierd. lol|`|r07BwhO1aa	Thanks for my 2 points troll!!!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Why the hell are you still living with your mom?

zu7lHvCdaa	First off Congrats!! Second does it matter as long as the baby is healthy and loved? Your child will be considered mix race they have that description now in lots of paper work and legal documents so no worries! I think most people just go by what they look like most to make things easier.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Bi-racial.|`|O4JuH8zmaa	mulato (sp?)|`|MQKBTtG5aa	Maybe... "Wack"|`|K9G6n17Oaa	Most people will consider your child black.  The child will most likely have a darker skin tone than a white person.  It's not a big thing unless you make it one.    I'm not sure what you mean by technically but,    on many forms you can often fill in the circles for white and black.|`|4kfljeIGaa	Lots of Whites would probably consider him or her Black, but as for Blacks, well...that would be more difficult for me to say.  One girl on my dorm floor had one parent of each color and she considered herself White.  If your child feels pressed by those racial questionnaire documents, just instruct him or her to put "other," and if asked to specify, then write, "human."  I've been doing that for years.  Yeah, it's snotty, but I don't understand why anyone wants or needs to know my race.  Besides, describing it would take forever!|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Your child will be half of both races. They are usually called a mulatto, but today that race is considered offensive. The politically correct term is bi-racial.|`|GeMenejZaa	bi-racial, but a lot of times people would say black. it depends on who you ask|`|VhLnzDYgaa	congrats :) uh bi-racial  half black half white  like obama :)
y4Uliyq3aa	Blakely Hope~I really like this name. Alot of people have been naming there daughter's Blake but It Is a boys name. The ly adds feminity so It work for a girl. Hope sounds beautiful with It. 10/10    Elizabeth Anne~This Is what I would call a safe name because they are two classic and beautiful names! They flow very well together and sound wonderful when you say the name aloud. 10/10    Rachel Kathleen~I Love the name Rachel. I have to be honest and say I don't personally like Kathleen because I have a bad association with It but It does sound great with Rachel and If you Love It you should definately go with It. 9/10    Kaylee Faith~Great name. Faith Is one of my favorites for a middle name. It sounds wonderful with Kaylee. 9/10    I Love all these names really!    God Bless~  Morgan Leilani|`|DP48dIxhaa	I don't like Blakely Hope or Kaylee Faithh. I like the others though.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	Blakely???    I like Rachel Kathleen!!!|`|U1juqahIaa	I like Elizabeth Anne and Rachel Kathleen, although the first names are a bit too plain.  Kathleen works great with Rachel and it gives it some spark.  Kaylee and Blakely are horrid and too trendy.|`|8wn7rQH4aa	The only one I like is Elizabeth Anne! I love both of those names, but I prefer them spelled Elisabeth Ann! Either way is gorgeous though!|`|koXcq0l1aa	I hate the hope, faith, grace, star, rain, sky middle names.  Just kind of strange to me.  I also think that Blakely and Kaylee are a little too popular lately.  I don't know.  I personally am not a big fan of any of them, but Rachel Kathleen is the most original although that's not saying much...given the choices.|`|I8Xwe16Kaa	i love Kaylee Faith, it is a great combination.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	I never cared for names like Faith or Hope.    I tend to think of a few things for those names, i) The parents were white trash, ii) The parents watched too many soap operas, iii) The parents had dreams of their child becoming a stripper...    Please don't name your children either of those...|`|Elxuvon8aa	I do not like blakely I like kaleen better than Kaylee Kayleigh maybe the Kaylee is a little too modern Elisabeth Anne is what I was going to use for our youngerst she was unnamed until she was 5 days old she was very small it was just too big for her. The combination of Rachel is good
bcZSIphUaa	It really sounds like Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).    I recommend that you "google" it.    It is a hormonal disorder that causes infertility in women.    For me the symptoms are:  - Irregular periods (I haven't had period since stopping the pill 5 months ago).  - No ovulation  - Pimples    Other people experience symptoms such as weight gain, increased hair etc.    If you are diagnosed and TTC, you will be put on Metformin which in many cases helps PCOS women to ovulate. If this doesn't work then you will be put on clomid which is a fertility drug that stimulates ovulation. Then if still no success there are injectable fertility drugs or IVF.    I am of course assuming that you have PCOS - it is after all, the most common cause of irregular periods in women of child bearing age.    I have PCOS and have just started on Metformin.    Here's hoping that you don't have it - but at least you will know if there is a problem and there is a lot of hope out there!|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	He/she will probably prescribe Provera to start your period.  If you have had an infertility workup (including testing your partner's sperm) then he or she might prescribe another medication such as Clomid to help you ovulate.|`|2791882f90477b9699ca0a79e64b57caaa	my guess would be clomid or metformin.
bcZSIphUaa	It doesn't matter AT ALL!    Why are you concerned?      No one worries about blood type because it doesn't matter!|`|6fLxNyVpaa	nothing should be different at all|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	The only time blood type matters is when the mother is negative and the baby is positive.  Since you are positive you have nothing to worry about.|`|b47fe4a0b1c7337ece7bbbffa4c65d6baa	I understand your concern. Blood type can be vefry important depending on whether or not this is your first pregnacy|`|Bzb6rSeCaa	You should check with your doctor, from what I know O- is a rare blood type, My mum has O- and my dad has O+ , people with O- cant have transplants from any other blood type or it will pretty much poison them. Mum has talked about having to have blood test or an injections or something after labour to make sure that none of the babies blood has transferred into hers as it would be really bad for her, all her babies had O+ blood type, if the baby was O- then there would not be a problem for her.  I don't know how this would work for you cos it's the opposite way around then my parents, I don't know very much about blood types, maybe if you gave birth to a O- baby there might be issues but im really not sure!!  I want to now find out about all this cos My hubby is apparently A- and I am O+, so i don't know if there are issues involved in that!!
bQAvca08aa	they will have you take a blood test more than likely. also if you have not had your period by say the end of february after a negative blood test then go back to the gyno and see if they can do a pelvic exam on you. or an ultrasound. maybe your body is just going through changes from not being on BC anymore. also if you want to get pregnant then right now you are the most fertile (1st month after stopping BC is always like that) you can send me an email if you want to.|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	Not by just a regular vaginal exam...but they can give you a blood test if you ask for one. Blood tests are 100 percent accurate.|`|IBOcGSGlaa	it could just be from the pills and your sudden stopping from taking them. When you go to the doc ask for a rapid pt or blood test...
JnLoHaoAaa	Maybe in a way to some, but I support the Plan B pill|`|wMWfCjBpaa	It is not considered abortion. But many religious views on it consider it preventing creation. Kinda like you're playing with nature.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Nope.  Those who do think it is an abortion pill better be against birth control as well, that;s basically what it is.  If your already pregnant at the time of taking Plan B, then the Plan B pill will do absolutely nothing.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	...doesn't the plan B pill just prevent the egg or whatever from attaching to the lining?    Plan B's just a reallyyy big dose of birth control.  So if you think Plan B is abortion, so is birth control.|`|97JwSvUzaa	Not at all! Plan B will not terminate a pregnancy. If the egg is already fertilized by the time you take Plan B, it will not effect the pregnancy. It will only work if you have not conceived already.|`|627pWyVkaa	Plan B is not abortion So How can It be considered abortion? Only Pro-life advocates and people who do not research what it is and how it works say stuff like that. That are uneducated and only see and hear what they want too because of their strong beliefs. Plan B is birth control, So that would be saying the same thing as any woman who takes birth control is choosing abortion, and aborting every month "possible"fetuses. Plan B won;t work if a woman is already pregnant and is only 80% effective if taken in the first 24hr's After that it goes down and can only be taken upto 3 days because after that it won't work what so ever. And any woman who is already pregnant, and may be ignorant and think it will cause a miscarriage it will not. So No its not abortion, So I dont consider it abortion. Abortion is the abortion pill RU48 Or whatever its called and Surgical abortion D&C, aspiration, those are abortion.|`|M7gkORFTaa	i dont think so|`|lHKQdwsnaa	no your not even actually pregnant the morning after. It just prevents pregnancy
wi0CSqNSaa	The mother. The father isn't related to the child unless the mother lets him be or unless he goes through the courts.     The only option an unmarried father has for a child is this.    He can pay child support or get Fuc*ed|`|n6XYYyoLaa	idk , but i would guess the mother if u aren't married...call the hospital, the floor u will be on and they should have someone there that helps fill out the birth certificate that can tell u for sure...|`|wFVLP5l3aa	mums last name|`|an8O7r4kaa	baby automatically gets moms name, baby's dad has no say in anything, sorry pops, we carried it for 9 months, better damn well get our name, lol|`|O4JuH8zmaa	The mother.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Mom signs the paperwork not the dad. Dad has to sign an affidavit to have his last name on the birth certificate. If you guys aren't together you can also put "father unknown" to piss him off....hahaha...just kidding!!!!!!!! sorry had to do that! But he baby automatically get the mom's last name unless they you tell them otherwise.    Or you can make his/her name hyphenated if you choose to do so this way...|`|nbSp469Waa	Baby gets mom's last name.|`|DimCcvwkaa	The mother of the child.

OpduZC3Eaa	Sounds to me like you're not pregnant and if you are wanting to know for sure then go to your doctor, no big deal. All of your other symptoms, sounds to me like you are stressing WAY TO MUCH! Stress can do horrible horrible things to your body and really fast! I suggest you take it easy, take a breath, go to the doctor and get your non-pregnancy confirmed. It's okay!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it sounds like you arent pregnant.   but need to get a blood test at the doctors very soon.     ~ God Bless ~|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Sounds like you have diabetis|`|SFEAMiUAaa	Find out by doing the test!!!    You are going to do it anyways!!    Unless you are virgin and have diabetis!|`|ENANtueuaa	Well you took a plan B, got your period AND had 8 negative test results, so i'm guessing you aren't pregnant. If you wanna know for sure, make an appt with your doctor, and get a blood test, that should settle your nerves. Stress can cause you to have pregnancy symtoms. Our bodies can play tricks on us, and if you are thinking about being pregnant and all the symptoms you can actually make your body feel the symptoms, and still not be pregnant. PMS symptoms are also similar to pregnancy symptoms, so that could be another reason. Hope this helps!|`|9op65iQVaa	you are paranoid.  you are not preg.  relax.|`|dMRYNQ2naa	Go to a doctor and see what they have to say.
Ez4d9g3vaa	I really wouldn't worry.  My twins are almost 5 (identical boys) and they still do this.  Our doctor calls it "twinese" - only they know what they are saying.  They will probably continue to have trouble communicating with others because they have each other, they really don't need others and tend to push them away.    As long as you and others continue to use the right words for things, they will eventually pick it up.  They will always have that special bond that we can never understand unless we too are a twin.  They will continue to talk in their own language and you can't change that but, soon enough they will realize that they can't use their language to communicate with the world.      Try to spend some individual time with each of them.  It may help them discover their own independence.  You can mention it to their doctor but I think it's completely normal.  In a few years, they will be just fine.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I think it's typical that twins would have their own special language with one another.  However, it's not so good that they don't know regular speech for everyday communication with others. I would look into seeing a speech therapist for an evaluation, now - before they hit school age.|`|P8VoBR0saa	Ask your ped, but my mom is a twin and my grandmother said they did that till they were about 5 they had their own language that only they understood, just work with them, my daughter is 3 she has a really good vocabulary but a few of her letters are mixed up and i'm going to have her looked at at her next appt, i have a   that you could call if you want to ask them, it's for early childhood development if ur intrested in it email me and let me know, hope this helps|`|TSsT8QGgaa	my situation was my daughter spoke for BOTH of them.  my son was a bit "delayed" and only his sister could understand him.  i was his mother and at times i didnt know what he wanted.  try and work with them,,,read to them,,,find word games that are fun and educational.  i wouldnt be concerened this early, just keep working at it.  speak to your pediatrician for advice.  if they think there is a real problem they can help you find the help you need.  it seems my son took forever to get it right.  but now at 11 he is fine and has no problems (he is actually highly intelligent and tested for the gifted class).    i learned i would "make" him ask himself and "make" him work on it to get what he wanted.  if he wanted a glass of milk,,,i made him figure it out and tell me what he wanted.
bcZSIphUaa	If you have irregular periods often then you may have PCOS|`|6fLxNyVpaa	you might be fine. you should schedule a doctors appointment asap to make sure your not miscarriage. but remember a negative can still be a positive.|`|EMPVvJcDaa	I usually get a brown discharge right before I start. It could be completely normal. Your period can be late for many reasons, change in diet, change in sexual activity, medication, stress, or even change in physical activity. I would personally give it another week (as long as you don't start having severe pain). If you still haven't started then I would take another pregnancy test of even schedule a doctors appointment. Blood work can detect a pregnancy from as early as three weeks and is 99 percent accurate. The main thing is to calm down and not stress about it. This can make your period even later. Just remember that everything happens for a reason!
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	I understand that you don't want to hear this, but there is little that you can do. Teenagers at this age are extremely stubborn and want little to do with friends that don't share the same point of view and aren't "cool" enough. Shell grow out of this phase eventually...in the meanwhile, you could attempt talking to her. Maybe you should show up to her house randomly and talk about who've she has become? Obviously, shell proclaim that she hasn't changed at all or will come up with a ridiculous excuse, but it's worth a shot if you want your friend back. Good luck.|`|xZvzLztZaa	It's a difficult situation.    You're a good person for caring as much as you do.  Talk to her, plead with her to think about what she is doing.    Unfortunately, chances are she won't change; it's her decision and she's made a bad ones.    If you believe she is putting herself in serious danger, report it, anonymously if you want, but nevertheless, report it, for her own good.    Good luck,  Micah
dwAZSVFHaa	i am sexualy active, and if i ever got pregnant even at my age of 16 almost 17, i would keep my baby. im against abortion, its evil, and its murder. here is some things pro-choicers need to think of.    women say they are raped and need an abortion? rap is an excuse, its not the babies fault someone was raped, why kill a child? why take it out on them? did you know that for every child aborted there would have been 10 YES 10  loving families that would have given it a life.      teen girls may say they are too young for a child, well if you are to young to have kids, then dont have sex, and plus its called let the child live and adopt it out.       and overpopulation is a HUGE terrible excuse, why would someone kill a child because there are too many people?    and because the father didnt want a child is another excuse, why kill a child because your man didnt want one? that shows both immaturity and selfishness.       a babies heart starts beating at 22 days old, and by that time brain waves start, a unborn baby has,eyes,toes,fingers,blood, a brain and if its not alive, then why and how can it kick its moms tummy form the inside? its not a blob of cells its a child!! its a child not a choice!!       and heres some thing abortion can do to the women that have them.    first off, in some rare cases, abortion can cause the woman to die.    abortion causes breast cancer, and sometimes part of the baby can remain inside of the woman,making her hemmorage and can ruin her tubes, and her chances of having a normal child, or even having any child.     abortion causes POST ABORTION SYNDROME, and yes it IS REAL. some women have even killed themselves over having an abortion, women regret and have to live with it for the rest of thier lives.       heres what abortion can do to the fathers.     abortion can cause POST ABORTION SYNDROME, to fathers also, remember, the father helped make the child,a nd fathers DO have hearts.  some have even commited suicide, along with needing counseling, and some have even went as far as divorcing thier wives for having an abortion.       abortion also hurts many other people, including a family that would have adopted the child. and abortion hurts family members of the woman and child, such as aunts of the child, uncles,grandmothers and grandpas.      abortion takes away a child chance at life.    its takes away a family who cannot have kids's chance of getting to raise a child.     it takes away the mother happiness and in some cases even her life.    its takes away a fathers dream to have a child.       and people support such an evil thing that hurts so many people?  IM PROUD TO BE PRO-LIFE!!!|`|MA3KcLUJaa	I would probably get an abortion. Frankly, because my parents would kill/disown me. And there is no way I could support a child.  Yeah, I know "if you're not ready to have a kid you're not ready to have sex."  I've heard that enough, thanks.    But, I would only get one if it was early on, when I could just take the pills and get it over with.  I don't know what I would do if the father didn't agree. But, I guess it's my decision, not his.    But there is no way I could keep the baby. It is terrible, and I would feel so bad, but I would.|`|lHKQdwsnaa	i got pregnant and i was really scared and my mom felt it would be better to have an abortion. So I did and i do regret and it is hard sometimes but its in the past and i can't do anything about it now.   My mom and the fater were involved the whole time|`|zwvSmpNUaa	a baby has a heart beat after 16 days fyi|`|H6LxeWZfaa	well, if the case was that my boyfriend is the baby's father, i would definately not abort.  i am 16, but we've gona through a couple pregnancy scares but we decided if it ever happened we would definately not abort.  it is a cruel thing and definately against our religion too.  it was our choice to have unprotectected sex, right?  so we will have to follow the concequences of our mistake.  not try to completely eliminate and kill it.    but, we are very very very safe and know not to be stupid, and every chance we take having sex theres a chance at getting pregnant.  but i take birth control and he still uses a condom.    and thinking about abortion make me cringe, like it must hurt so bad.  like ripping your insides out.  poor babies :(|`|VhLnzDYgaa	Im 15 and if I had a baby  I would NEVER have an abortion EVER.    How could anyone kill a baby for their MISTAKE  There are things called ADOPTION or just keep it.    Yeah lets keep killing babies for our stupidity.    And yeah I am sexually active  But ive stopped.  Because before you have sex you need to think about if you want a baby   Or not.  And if yu dont then dont have sex, geez.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	I'm not sexually active so I don't have to worry about all that sh*t. But yeah, if you don't use a condom and birth control it's your fault. Abortion should NOT be used as a form of birth control.     But honestly, a heart beating doesn't really signify much in any manner other than a symbolic one.  A fetus can only feel pain when it is around 23 weeks old. I am pro-choice as well but I do believe after that point abortions shouldn't be permitted.    Remember that we kill countless fully developed animals every day. Pigs, a widely killed animal, are estimated to have the same level of intelligence as dogs.|`|ZQ0dRFoTaa	It's a foetus, not a baby.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I am primarily against abortion, except in special circumstances. I don't want to generalize, because every situation is different, so I suppose I am actually undecided, but I believe you should look elsewhere before having an abortion. Like its a last resort sort of thing.   I know a baby has a heart beat after 22 days, and I do believe that it is human. I know some people don't, but its ALIVE! Whether its human or not, its alive. Search abortion in google images. Don't if your squeamish.   I am a virgin, but I do have a boyfriend, and obviously we've talked about sex, because whats the point in having a relationship if you can't talk about things? I was fifteen in January, by the way.  If it was forced sex, I have no idea, I don't really want to think about that. I know I would regret termination, and probably adoption too, so I don't know.  But if it was entirely my choice, I would keep the baby. My mistake, my problem, I'll get my head down and deal with it, because abortion isn't right for me. I understand that it is right in some situations, and I wouldn't condemn anyone for having an abortion unless they were perfectly stable and capable finically, if they "just didn't want a child," then it is wrong.That's selfish.   And I did know all the facts. I have no idea why some people think the pull-out "method" works!  I would include my babys father in every asspect of the pregnancy too.  EDIT: For all the people giving thumbs down, grow the hell up. Your not going to get far in life if you can't accept other peoples opinions.|`|r39EDGhPaa	If I were to get pregnant right now, I would get an abortion.  Why?  Because if I were to get pregnant it would be through every type of protection I could possibly use.  Spermicide, birth control, condoms, and pulling out.  Obviously I would have tried to prevent from becoming pregnant, so why would I have to suffer through a pregnancy?    It would have been my choice.    Doesn't everyone know that you can get pregnant with birth control and a condom?  Did you know that pulling out isn't even a method?    I know exactly how an abortion is done, stop making it sound so horrible.    I would include the father and discuss it with him, but I would have also discussed what I would do if I got pregnant before having sex with him in the first place, so if he wasn't down with the abortion, I wouldn't feel bad because I had already discussed it with him.    You sound like you're trying to convince people to become ignorantly pro-life.    edit: Adoption isn't always best.  Some people are cowards and won't pick the family, and there is no guarantee that every baby will be adopted.   People like new born, healthy babies.  Not 2 year olds or children with autism or down's.  See where adoption fails in some aspects?  I know how the abortion pill works, stop trying to sound smart.. lmao this is the pregnancy and parenting section, we know all of this.|`|pAW2c7c9aa	just do it|`|QGkBZFqWaa	If I got pregnant my boyfriend and I would take care of the baby. Although it's not the preferred situation I would love my boyfriend to be my baby's father. We are in love for real :]|`|kRaVa0Wraa	abort it.   and they dont "rip its body apart" CHECK YOUR FACTS HUN.    and learn to spell.|`|8XURx7nzaa	im for abortion but I think you should only have it for the right reasons like if you were raped or your just to young to have kids & there is no way to support it. not just because you want to be having sex & thats your form of birth control. because some ppl are just to lazy to use condoms or some form of birth control. I always used to think that if i got pregnant i would get an abortion right away, but then I had a pregnancy scare & i thought there is no way I can get one. thank god i wasnt but it is a womens choice to get one & to do what she wants. but like i said for the right reasons.|`|i171LlfTaa	I did have sex, and I am pregnant. (14)  I would never get an abortion, I think that it is horrible and would never kill an innocent child because of a stupid choice that someone made.   I don't think that I would put my child up for adoption, because well I just think that if I was irrisponsible to get pregnant then I should be the responsible one to raise the child, even if that means having to give up going to collage and finishing highscool.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	I am not sexually active but I still have an opinion. I swear I feel the hatemail and thumbs down coming on.    Yes, I know you can get pregnant using any form of contraception but I would take all precautions to make sure I don't get pregnant. I would still have an abortion. Not JUST for my sake but also what kind of life would I provide for the baby? In my position, not a very good one. I would rather have finished my education and be prepared for this. Abortions happen for many reasons and alot of Pro-Life people don't even take them into consideration. Of course I would consider the baby's father because it makes 2 people to get pregnant. In saying that, I would believe that I would have the final say in it because it is my body and he could easily leave and I could still be there with a baby.|`|gG8oyymiaa	I'm 17 I am 6 months pregnant. I choose to have sex so I choose to deal with the fact that now I am having a baby on the way and my life is no longer my own. If you don't want a kid, or you can not supply for one. Just keep your legs closed. I am tired of just hearing peoples excuses. If I can take care of this child at my age other people can too. People need to start owning up to there responsibilities or just don't have sex.|`|6juV48RWaa	at the age of 17 on the verge of starting college, i would get the abortion. its would be emotionally painful for me, because i've always wanted to have a baby...but my own life comes first. my boyfriend and I have already had this discussion. Our parents wouldnt give us any support, and if we cant afford the baby, we'd get the abortion. BUT I USE PROTECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. because i dont want to make a life and then destroy it. We're safer than anyone we know and we're damn proud of it. once college is done and i start a good job, i'm gonna pop one out right away!|`|5RoYyprkaa	I'm 18 years old and engaged. In a very stable relationship but not well off financially because I'm a full time student and my fiance got laid off. However, if I did get pregnant, I would keep the baby. I know that people would think that I'm selfish because the only money I have is what I've saved and earned. It's not a whole lot, but it's something. I know my parents would be unhappy, but they would help out, and I would do everything in my power to care for my child. It wouldn't be easy, but my fiance and I could handle it. As for adoption, I'm all for it, but I don't think I could carry something inside me for 9 months and hand it off to someone else.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I am very much against abortion. If I got pregnant I would probably give it up for adoption. My, I don't what to call her mother because to me she isn't so I'm going to call her a vessel for the baby my mother couldn't have, gave me up for adoption. If she had decided to kill me I wouldn't be here today and I am thankful for that everyday!    Edited  If you think a fetus/baby I don't care what you call the person, can't feel pain or emotion then explain this http://thornwalker.com/babyhand/babyhand... if he couldn't feel or think at the age he is, which is the age where you can legally abort, then please explain the story, explain what you see in the picture. And those who are for abortion don't give me the "it was instinct crap" I know what instinct is and this wasn't it.|`|xRJQSNJeaa	I'm 16 and no way would I ever get an abortion I'm totally against it. Abortion is murder no matter what anyone else thinks. First off by 22 Days a baby is functioning it's not a blob it's a CHILD. And then by eight weeks your baby has all it's functioning body parts Lungs, Hearts, Kidney, Livers and Fingers and Toes they just have to develop. There are so many problems with abortion to think about it just horrible. What your basically doing is murdering this poor innocent child that didn't do anything wrong. I thing that having abortion is selfishness. If you can't take a being a mother then give it up for adoption. Not only are you lucky that you can conceive a baby there are 35 year old women who are ready to be mothers out there that want a baby and can't conceive so give it to them. Yes you will have to carry a baby for 9 months but you know something you had sex you made that choice not the baby that is in your womb the most you could do is give it that much. I know that some people are going to hate me for what I said but it's the truth. And not only does an abortion cause problems when it happens and what not but there are repurcussions for after it happens theres regret, sucide from the regret, counseling, other people in the family being upset. And in some cases I've read about women havent been able to conceive after because I  whatever they did or didn't do and didn't follow the doctors order. I think every baby deserves a life and how would you feel if you knew that your mother didn't want you and they wanted to abort you but didn't and one last thing to think about. Between the 6 and 8 week mark a baby can distingush there mother how would that feel.|`|kauRr6X8aa	I don't know. I can't ever imagine what it'd be like in that situation. I'd probably talk to a lot of people, get medical advice, talk to my boyfriend and make the decision based on that. I can't say 100% I would keep it or 100% I'd abort or 100% I'd adopt.     Your abortion 'facts' don't scare me. There are worse things going on this world today than termination of pregnancy.     I don't think it's for anyone to judge whether someone has an abortion or not.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	I was 15 when i got pregnant (16 when i had her) and i refused to get an abortion. I don't regret having my baby, she means everything to me. I made the decision to have sex so i took the responsibility of it. I thought about what i would do if i got pregnant again what i would do and i am very torn i want my daughter to be a baby and have time to be Mommy's baby but i don't think i could ever live with myself if i had an abortion or adoption.|`|L5xLdtVcaa	i am 20 so im technically not a teen anymore but when i was 16 i did have a pregnancy scare and i had it set that if i was pregnant there would be no way that i was going to get an abortion! i knew what would happen from having sex, so i was going to deal with it!
P8VoBR0saa	I have a friend that had a baby at the age of 17 and she wasn't ready for it at all in anyway but since she had her she's grown up so much and she's one of the best mothers i know, i agree age is just a   and if your mature enough theres nothing wrong with it, i still to this day get rude looks from people, i'm 23 and i have 3 children,   you shouldn't listen to them, be proud of yourself your still in school, your working and engaged, your doing fine!|`|pOEH4HLuaa	because they're young and immature most of them drunk and you know stupd but from ur pov ur all good, just don't be mad at the baby|`|mG6Pu12Paa	I do agree with you.  Some people do have a Holier then Thou attitude.  It is a sad aspect of life that everybody has to deal with.  When people see/talk to me and find out I'm on disability I have the same problem (I'm only 42 the stroke happened in '02).  They don't realize I spent the better part of a week in a coma.  And had less then a 25% chance of living let alone taking care of myself.         Just try to remember that there are some of us out here would love to be able to help you and would stand with you during times of trial.       I hope this doesn't offend you but I will try to remember you in my prayers and in my thoughts.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	ok...breathe in...breathe out...  lol!  it's great to let that out of your chest.  but really, teen moms are always going to be slammed here.  just like SAHMs, working moms, moms with ADHD kids, etc.    it's just that people can say and will say everything here because everyone stays anonymous.  cowardly act but whatever rocks their boat, right?  so just don't take them seriously.  you're just as anonymous to these people as they are to you.  they don't know how great a teen mom you are and they don't deserve an explanation from you.  honestly, if you can provide for your child on your own and have the emotional maturity level for it, then you're doing great.  and no one can say otherwise.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Feel better now?    On this site, most women are bitches and would never say any of the things they say on here, in real life.

Just smile and nod at their ignorance and move along.  Who cares what these anal people think.|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	yea i agree with you. some younger people are bad parents. but its the same with older people. my mother was a horrible mother. she was 21 when she had me.  some people are just IDIOTS!|`|6juV48RWaa	Age is nothing but a number.

3533f4919287d52194cf39aedfda9625aa	Yes, you can test too early, try testing in the morning when the hormone is the strongest.  If you still get a neg, then try to have a blood test done in about a week or two.  Believe me sometime is can be in your head, but just to make sure blood test will pick it up no matter what.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes it is possible.  Also you may have drunk too much water. and pee may have been diluted.    Best time to test is 1 to 2 weeks after missed period.  definitely sounds like pregnancy to me.    God bless & all the best|`|jNqf8HtDaa	take the test in the morning or go get a blood test but i dont know what PCOS is so im not sure     sorry|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	Are your periods regular? If you're not sure when to expect your period, you may want to go back to the doctor if you think you could be pregnant. Blood tests are more sensitive than home pregnancy tests.    PCOS can make it difficult to conceive AND cause irregular periods. I went for a year without having a period until I started taking birth control to regulate my period and Metformin to treat the insulin resistance.     Good luck.
7iMZ91K7aa	Wow, when I was reading your question... I almost for a second thought I was reading one of my own!! lol I also am 22, turning 23 in May, not April... My hubby and I bought our house 2 years ago also, and we both also want a baby... but he (just like your husband) was going back and forth there for awhile.. he obviously wants a baby, hes just scared and nervous, which is totally okay, just remember to not push the topic on him, let him come to it on his own, which he already has, hes just nervous... let him be the one to bring up the subject, not you.... Its a lot easier for the guy, to pretend like he doesnt know whats going on, and for you to become pregnant "accidently" vs. the two of you sitting down, and saying, "okay, we have to baby dance on this day, this day, this day and this day" it makes it to real for him and scares him... he'll come around.. GOOD LUCK AND TONS OF BABY DUST!!! |`|Xp2De933aa	Im right there with you girl (although a little younger) I just turned 20 and have been ttc for 17 months and had one m/c. my fiance is 23, almost 24. people who don't know us, claim we are "young and dumb" but the people who do know us, think other wise. we bought our first home about a year ago, we are getting married on may 9th 2009 (3 more months, yay!)  he has completed college and has a good job, i am almost finished with college. etc etc. the bottom line is, we are prepared and personally ready to take on the responsibility. age has nothing to do with it. I have a cousin who gave birth right after she turned 17, everyone said she would do horrible, but honestly she is a better mother then some people double her age. don't worry about others opinions, good luck!|`|agfiNdLraa	Im 20 and just found out today im pregnant!!!! And me and my husband are THRILLED. we have been trying for two years!.

Also it's a great example to young girls that you waited on marriage to have kids.    Most dads are scared of first time, so keep him involved in the decision process and make sure to HOLD OFF until he's for SURE.  You can't take back a baby once it's born and it's best for the child to have a father who really wants it.|`|YsBrTBmIaa	You need to feel good about yourself and get all the support you can from your friends.|`|XO4talxxaa	I am 22 and my hubby is 26 both of our birthdays are in july! lol We have been TTC  1 for 4 months!

He is ready for child and is 23. We both wait every month to see if it has happened. He gets just as disappinted and upset as I do when AF comes. At first he did say well maybe we should wait but as of now he is helping me pick out names and all the other things that come along with having a child.    Good Luck to you and your husband.|`|a8a51573e723f5425e2acc43d7e5f72caa	I'm 21 going on 22 and my fiance and I are ttc baby 1.  The best part is we still live at home with his parents, saving for a house and such.  We know it will be welcomed and we just feel ready.  We just both had images with us with a baby and decided that it was the right time.  Go by your gut.
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	since when did emo become a style? Emotionalism is a serous problem, sometimes leading up to suicide. However, most teenagers who claim to be 'emo' are just posers. Being emo is not a good thing...do you honstly think attempting suicide or cutting yourself is 'in'? No, it's not ... I have attempted suicide before. If you think emo is a style, please search up punk rock style or something instead.

5lRevKBoaa	sometimes any kind of birth control can make ur period irregular. however wait until the end of this month if you have no period test or if ur very concerned about it go see ur doctor.    good luck hun.
HbaxtX44aa	i would bathe my babies with me until they started poking at stuff.  how curious they can be!!|`|b0z0pbdXaa	yeah, why not.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Yes. My daughter quite often takes her showers with mummy and daddy and absolutely loves it. She is 1 yr old and absolutely loves the water. The only way i see it as wrong is if the child is being abused. Also i think a line should be drawn at a certain age.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Sure. As long as they aren't uncomfortable with it.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Yes.  As long as everything is on the up and up and as long as everyone is comfortable with it, it is fine.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	5 and under  my mom forced me to take a shower with her until 12!!  it was gross, and eek  ewww   i don't want to think about that  i had to pretend i didn't want baths and then id take them at 11 at night, and now well, its become a habit, shes used to the ideal that i don't want to and i take shower at 11 at night|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	Its definitely ok with a baby, probably even safer that way. As to what age to stop, Im not sure. It probably depends on the indvidual child.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I sure do at an appropriate age|`|wqe6FOyUaa	i would say it would be a good idea but it also depends on the age of the baby/child.. if its a new born i think its best to bath it on its own but if its older then 1 yrs old then i dont see a problem|`|DNygQdmVaa	yeah until a certain age.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I think it's perfectly fine.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	of course it is fine, and perfectly natural.|`|i7XkKqhgaa	i think its fine, i shower with my little girl. but once she gets uncomfortable or they reach the age of around 3 then get them used to being just with themselves (obviously with your supervision)|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I'm a new mommy to a 5 month old, so ever since he was born, it's hard for me to take a shower, especially a long shower that I can enjoy and get everything done in! (I hate going more than a couple of days without shaving.)    Since I don't like burdening my mom with babysitting for 30 minutes after she gets off of work so that I can take and enjoy a shower, this is what I do. I lay my son in his baby tub, and I plug up the hole. I then fill it up with warm water, and then push it all the way to the end of the bathtub. So while he lays in his baby tub, kicking and laughing and squirming, I'm standing on the other end of the tub (under the shower head). That way I have him with me and I can take my time. He loves baths, so he never fusses. I just talk and sing and occassionally hold him so that he can feel the running water out of the shower head hitting his back. He likes that. :o)    Anyway, back to your question! I'll probably only do this until he's about 1 or 2 years old. I'm conservative with my views, and I don't think it's right to openly expose nudity (family or not) if it is not necessary past a certain age. Obviously, seeing your child's nudity is necessary, needed, and natural while they are still very young. And your child is fine seeing you naked until a certain age. But like I said, I believe the cut off time for children to see their parents nudity would have to be by about 2 years of age.|`|VzOokYEqaa	my daughter is almost 8 months old and i take showers with her all the time. she loves the water! i think its fine while they are young but probably not past 2 or 3|`|0odNqJTBaa	Yes, until they can take a shower on their own, I think it's fine to shower with them. Otherwise, they'll fall and hurt themselves. I don't quite see the point of getting in the tub with them unless they're really tiny, but if the child is happier that way, why not? If you feel uncomfortable, wear a swim suit.    This goes to one of the things that irks me about US culture. We worry when our children see a naked body (even that of their parents), but we have no problem exposing our children to violence on television. Maybe if we worried more about violence and less about sexuality, our nation and the world would be a better place.|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	Sure, when they are little.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i bathed with my babies (i have twins) alot when they were newborns, as toddlers they did sometimes too.  alot of the time it was the ONLY way i got a shower.
vpHhryPWaa	One of the best things I had for my son when he was like that was a wrap. It is essentially a realllly long piece of fabric that you wrap around yourself and the baby to carry them in. I would 'wear' him all day long - because they are so close to you, wrapped up tight and warm they feel similar to how they felt in the womb. You can try some white noise too - like the vaccume or dryer - for some reason newborns find them calming. Bundle up and go for a walk if your weather is permitting - sometimes a change of scenery works wonders for both of you. Another thing that worked really well for me and my little guy was to run a warm bath for the both of us - the warm water calmed him down some and then I would nurse him in the tub - normally it worked like a charm.   I know it's soo overwhelming in the first couple of months when you and baby are just figuring each other out. Know that in time she won't cry as much and will be distracted much easier. Don't be afraid to give yourself a time out too - ask your partner, friend or family member to hold the crying baby for a minute (or 20) while you take a breather. If you don't have someone who can help, then put baby down in a safe spot and go to another room for a minute or two and then come back a little bit refreshed and ready to try everything again (rock, bottle/breast, cuddle, bath...etc)  Good Luck hun, you will make it through this!!|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Try swaddling her. it worked for my baby when she was 1 month old.|`|PhkLLwVbaa	I had the same problem with my son it was 3 months old but it sounds like you are having the right ideas. Which is great. Take a breathe I know you probably feel like a failure because you cant figure out what is wrong with her. First get a warm wash cloth and wash her down i'm sure when you are stressed a warm bath helps you to relax then get some baby lotion rub her down. I don't know if you have any stuff animals that play any baby songs but that can help. She is probably still going to cry with my son I tried everything I did the things I just told you to do I stretched out on the couch and I let him lay on me and cry but he would position himself I would move him around a little bit to help him get comfortable it was tummy problems but what your baby need is comfort. Let her feel like your not hovering her  but you are there just rub on her back and pat it and sing to her let her cry some and let her be completely stretched out when you rock them and stuff they don't get to lay stretched out. I hope this can help you and that it works.|`|8XrdJtv5aa	Swadle her, turn her on her side, giggle her VERY GENTLY go "SHHHHHHH"  relatively loudly in her ear. It sounds insane but it mimics the environment inside the womb. Tomorrow, get the book, "The Happiest Baby on the Block", some of the stuff in it doesn't work but much of it does. Just remember, this will pass, Good Luck!|`|VzOokYEqaa	before you get delusional see if you can get someone to watch her for a few hours so you can sleep. then you will be able to deal with your babies needs. sometimes you get to that point where you just dont know what your doing because your so tired. try giving her a bath that would always calm my baby down.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	take her to the doc; she could have reflux or something else causing her pain or discomfort and she can't tell you; at least have her checked over...|`|IGwX328eaa	she may need a setting change can you take her for a car ride? that usually calms my son down. Also you can try singing for her or if you have colorful toys for her that light up and make noise you can hang them in front of her. good luck!|`|P8VoBR0saa	try layin her on her back on your thighs and gently pushing her knees towards her stomach, it might be gas and she can't get it out, that really helped with my daughter
agfiNdLraa	Clomid worked for me!!! round three! found out today im pregnant!
L5xLdtVcaa	thats how my parents were when i was 17! i got my belly button pierced when i was 17 and it took awhile to convince them to let me. Just explain to them that you will be getting a tiny stud for i and you will barely be able to see it. If that doesnt work than try to make a deal with them. I made a deal with my dad that if i kept my room clean and chores up to date (where they didnt have to ask me to do them) for 1 month than they would let me get it. well i did it and so they were forced to let me get it. try it and let me know if it works|`|xfpJGBfwaa	What you're asking us is how to force your mother to change her mind.  It's not ethical to even consider such an idea.  Her opinion is her opinion.  Trying to make her change is the behavior of a control freak.      You're 4 months away from being 18.  When you're 18, start paying rent, and do what you want, and don't let her opinions affect your decisions anymore.  But as long as you live there you'll have to listen to them.  And as long as you're paying rent, you won't have to do what she says.  That's a fair trade, right?|`|igLsH24Qaa	Why do you want to get your nose pierced? It just looks like a metal zit. Piercings do not make you cool or special. They simply distract from your looks. The same with tattoos. Listen to your Mother and love your skin the way it is.|`|0unqJPehaa	Why would you want to do such? It's ugly and not cool at all, and when you try to get a job, most places will not let you have one, unless you work at a place like Hot Topic.  Even when you go around asking if places are hiring, they will judge you by looks.|`|AA12029875	everybody else is doing it?  shows you can't think for yourself.   your body is not yours to mutilate until you are no longer your mother's responsibility. get it? good.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Why is it so important?  wait till you are 18!  your mother must have a reason behind it right?|`|AA10244380	Wait until you are 18, which is not that long of a wait.  Then, just do it.  She'll get over it, and hopefully she'll get it that you probably won't have it forever.  You probably won't, but enjoy it while you are young!  Someday you may have a job that requires you take out the piercing.    I did all kinds of things when I turned 18 and my mom, bless her, didn't say a word!  But, she took lots of pictures and she still haunts me with them! ( I thought I was soooo cool!)|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	My mother is the same way, and honestly, I think your mothers mind is already made no matter what you say. The only thing I can suggest is to do something beneficial, such as getting excellent grades or starting. Community service project like I did, and having the piercing be your reward. Otherwise, if she doesn't budge, just eff it.
IllWKAUGaa	I haven't had this happen, sorry, but I think you should talk to your doctor about this if you haven't already because it is a pretty specific condition and can affect your pregnancy and certain precautions should be taken and your doctor will be able to educate you on this situation to the best of their ability....    sorry i couldn't be of more help.  Good luck...
zPYyGw8oaa	Not really, you can wash the baby's gum's with a wet rag or buy those new wipes especially for babys...but it is not needed until they begin to get teeth :)|`|h9L1AtMsaa	After or during bathing time just wipe his gums with a wet washcloth or buy one of the figer toothbrushes, mad by Gerber and also come with baby toothpaste. I personally never did this, but I was told to....my kids mouths are just fine...beautiful teeth...and they started eating cereal at 6 weeks.|`|vpHhryPWaa	when my son was in the hospital the nurses told us that daily oral care right from the start was important - For the first 4 months we just used a wash cloth and wiped his gums and we have a little baby tooth brush for him. It's more of a game for my little guy now - cause I sing the "brush your teeth" song. I think it is good even just to get them used to it so when they start to get teeth they aren't completely opposed to having their teeth brushed.
dIxQ9rV5aa	He obviously hasn't learned yet to stick up for his younger sibling.  He may even be jealous of her obvious talent.  He should apologize to her for not protecting her, and for hurting her this way, but he needs to learn first that he has an obligation to protect her, rather than harm her.    All the children involved owe her an apology.  That's something their respective parents need to help them learn.  Whether it stems from the children or their parents, any failure to produce an apology for such harmful acts indicates intolerance toward Sapphire's difference from them that is likely to develop into bigotry against any people who are different from themselves, as they grow.    The children's parents may even need to learn this.  Otherwise, they may continue to raise children in whose company Sapphire will not be safe.    I'm glad she's named Sapphire.  It tells me that at least some people recognize that she's precious.|`|b0z0pbdXaa	i would put my foot in that kids ***!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Its so lovely you claim she has no social life, friends and is rubbish at everything but music. Way to encourage|`|i7XkKqhgaa	I would smack the @ $% out of him and ground him restricting him of anything he enjoys doing|`|jcdey9cgaa	He would work his but off until he earned enough money to help pay for her new stuff.  Also the other children involved would do the same or have charges pressed against them.  This World is so quick to say they are just kids it's just a phase.  They need to face reality and start have consequences for their actions.|`|6DWJAaSeaa	first off take away ALL privileges (he needs to learn that behavior is wrong and hurtful) that means after school he comes straight home, does his homework, and does chores around the house until he can get enough money to pay for all the things he destroyed.. kids are spoiled these days and don't understand the value of the dollar..i would also suggest calling the parents of the other brats that helped him do this!! NO TV, NO COMPUTER, NO NOTHING until things are replaced...    encourage Sapphier with her music try to get her involved in choir at school or band!! that's a talent that shouldn't be wasted!|`|fQuPOe3Haa	that kid is a b****|`|6sxLBLxgaa	Well it was probably peer pressure.  The only suggestion I have is for the parents to have a real talk with him.  Try to get him to open up which means to talk to him without yelling at him and  try to get him to trust them that they really want to help him.

It sounds like your water broke. It's not always a big gush and you don't always start contracting right away.
zxQT3Uo5aa	You don't make this a competition with your sister.    You accept that you may not be equally good in all things.    You define your success and failure based on the efforts that you know you have exerted and always do your best.    You don't accept defeat w/o a fight nor a fight where there can be no defeat.    You be proud of what you have done academically and you decide what your standard of performance shall be.    A "B" is not failure anywhere but in your mind.  Change it.|`|YsBrTBmIaa	I concur with Dan B.  Be yourself and always strive to be better.  If anyone else has a problem with it then tell them you are doing your very best.  If the teachers do not understand that , then tell the principal that.  He should understand.  ;)|`|wE89gFMfaa	Worry less about what people expect of you. Do what you can do. Do what you enjoy.

wgwxHRTAaa	We will be getting married having all of our children with us and celebrating as a family.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We usually just have a nice meal at home - either I just cook something special - or if there are extra bucks, maybe order in.  Once we were a family, it was Valentine's Day for the whole family, not just for us as a couple. I usually make a fancy dessert - heart-shaped, or heavy on the chocolate.  LOL on the NAP! Arrange it so you and your husband have extra nap time together!|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	We will go to dinner either before or after that day - NEVER on the 14, too expensive and too busy (My husband is working that night anyway).  We will exchange cards and a small gift and spend some quiet time together.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	We do not really celebrate it.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	my mom takes out chinese food in arizona  my dad is spending it with his family  in nyc|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Well I live in australia I mostly think too commercial, so we wont be celebrating it.|`|HyknHVV5aa	What we do is around now (beginning of Feb) we arrange for a sitter (usually a younger sitter that Valentines Day isn't important), and make supper reservations. When they day comes, we go for supper around 6:30, and ask the sitter to have the kids asleep by 9:30. We go to supper, and then go for a walk, or a drive, just the two of us. When we get home, the kids are asleep, we pay the sitter, then just the two of us lay in bed and watch a movie. We did this last year, and plan to repeat it this year! It worked great!|`|BeNazR8Jaa	if it's impossible to leave the house for the night, just buy a nice cake n wine and lit some candles and stay in.

wMWfCjBpaa	My daughter is not a twin and all I hear is gibberish as well. The doctor said she's perfectly fine. I have four cousins that spoke this way until they were 4. Yes 4! My uncle didn't say one word until he was 4 as well. He just came out in full sentences one day. Before he was 4 he understood everything someone said but never responded.    For now just read to them both. They enjoy it, it's great quality time, and you'll teach them language.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	it may be typical for twins to have a secret language, but I do not think it is OK for them to almost exclusively speak in it. My son has apraxia, and is in therapy for a speech delay. Most people who care to CAN understand him. As for vocabulary, he went from 10 words at 27 months old to hundreds of words now at 39 months old.    What you need to do is contact your local elementary school and ask them for a speech evaluation through the special needs preschool program. I am guessing that they would qualify. This would get them enrolled in a preschool program, and speech therapy for free. My son goes, and he loves it. He gets mad when they cancell school because of weather or something else. Not only is he getting speech therapy, but he is getting experience in other things too. He has learned to put his own coat on,pour a drink, work a handsoap pump, and sing songs. He is also learning ABCs, science things, all kinds of stuff....|`|DNygQdmVaa	you can take them to a speech theapist, early intervention, or wait until they start preschool.    Thats not normal for a 3 year old, but all kids do stuff differently.|`|3533f4919287d52194cf39aedfda9625aa	Not to worry, its actually very common for twins to speak to each other in a secret language.  They will develop in their own time.  If you are still worried talk to your dr before you totally freak out.  I have a friend with twins and they were the same way and around 4 they started to speak normally.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	While it's true that some twins develop what is called "twin speak", a typical 3 year old should be speaking in simple sentences and should be fairly understood.  A good resource is ASHA.org.  ASHA is the American Speech and Hearing Association.  They have quite a lot of information on typically development of speech and language.  They also break down what a child should know/say/sounds they should say by certain ages.  Another thing i tell parents, is that if you are concerned, get an evaluation from a licensed speech pathologist.  Best case, your children will be found to have age appropriate speech and language skills.  Or they may need speech services, but the sooner therapy starts, the better off the child.  Your doctor should know how to refer you to a speech therapist.  If you live in the US, you should be able to go through your local school district and the evaluation should be free.
yfcJwQr8aa	If your grandad is your legal guardian and he says no to you living with the friend. Then youcant legally and it is illegal for your friends dad to allow you to stay there knowing your grandad doesnt want you staying there.  And if you grandad wanted to he could take legal action against your friend dad for allowing you to stay their without his permision.

I'm pregnant now, but I'm older and I live with my fiance.    Please go get some condoms, it looks like you have a very active sex live and you clearly need protection.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Lucky?    No, dear. You are an idiot. You can get pregnant any time.    Alternatively, maybe you already have an STD which has made you infertile.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	uhhh your too young to be having sex    or with three plus guys    you need to use protection..thats gross.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	Your not going to be "lucky" forever either be responsible or stop having sex (which is the better option)|`|zu7lHvCdaa	my longtime boyfriend and i use to have sex without a condom of course I took him to my doctor and got us both tested for stds and such before we did anything. He always pulled out and I never got pregnant we both actually thought we could never have kids, mind you I have been doing this for four years! and then just like that I got pregnant so never ever think u cant get pregnant unless ur doctor says so. The chances of u getting pregnant is very slim since u got ur period but in some cases some women have still been pregnant I recommend to take this as a learning experience and be cautious next time if u must absolutely insists on having unprotected sex get the guy tested no shame in that and get on birth control planned parenthood can give u that for free as well as plan b even if ur under age w/out telling ur parents. also know when u are ovulating and write it on ur calendar and avoid having sex on and around those days usually about a week. Please be safe from now on for your sake never say it cant happen to u cause it can. good luck.|`|GnKb4cFEaa	get on the pill and stop sleeping around|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	You're not lucky until you get checked for STDs and get the all clear.   use condoms.

tPolDnwlaa	Get ready for the morning sickness!  Usually morning sickness kicks in full gear between 6 and 8 weeks of pregnancy... and it's usually gone by 12 weeks.  But, some people it lasts the whole pregnancy. The morning sickness will be the main thing except for the sore boobs and missed period for a while. Remember, even though it's called "morning sickness", you can get it at any time of the day.  The other lovely issues of pregnancy will develop way after you start to feel the baby move at around 14 weeks.

IVF can give you twins, but they'll be fraternal.(not identical)|`|jNqf8HtDaa	you cant really make yourself have twins unless you in invetro you have a better chance doing that|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	adopt some|`|0jDuZRGfaa	Have sex lol|`|O4JuH8zmaa	You're not going to have twins if you don't have a family history of them. The only way to get around that is fertility drugs.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	As the others have said, there's no way to guarantee twins.  While fertility treatments (either IVF or taking medication to increase your eggs at ovulation) can increase your chances, they can also increase the risk of having triplets or more, which are a real health risk for both you and the babies.  Most good doctors won't do fertility treatments on-demand, either - you need to verify first that there is some reason you are unable to conceive naturally.      For what it's worth, I always thought I wanted to have twins - I liked the idea of going through only one pregnancy and getting an instant family... well, I just had a baby and let me tell you, it is so much work -- I would never have been able to make it through the first couple months with more than one.  Between the difficult pregnancy and a fairly traumatic delivery, plus the ordinary needs of caring for an infant (and he's a remarkably easy baby)... it is all I can do to keep up with the one I have.|`|JsR4ypomaa	fertility treatments and have sex|`|wBxXGASgaa	i think their is nothing you can do but have sex but the husband determines what will it be a boy or girl or maybe twins i think|`|JdyRdLwVaa	If it doesn't run in your family you can try using fertility treatments or chlomid.But watch out if you use fertility treatments like IVF you can end up having up to 6 kids at once most of the time its only 2 or 3 kids at a time though.|`|qDAntnvOaa	Unless you get fertility treatments twin are just a thing that happens by chance. I know a lot of people who say they want to have twins but it isn't all fun and games! It is very hard on your body being pregnant and a bigger risk of prematurity (not fun) Then after then are born there is the expenses.. I breastfed for six months but when I stopped I started spending $80 AUS a week on formula. I love my twins but one at a time from now on please!!!|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	fertility treatments
ggfE4rlvaa	Vitamin E and aloe. Works wonders! You can get liquid vitamin E. Put some cocoa butter on your belly, then the vitamin E. It's thick stuff so the butter helps to spread it around better. Congrats on the baby and good luck!|`|QW6PhJPMaa	BIO oil...best ever!|`|naPq2mbtaa	palmers coco butter should work   (but it takes time)|`|PIJkva60aa	unfortunately stretch marks never go away.but they will lighten over timee.or when you began to loose weight from having your baby.  sorry and belive me your not the only onee!  :]|`|4kfljeIGaa	The earlier post was right: stretch marks never completely go away, but they do fade over time.  If you were quite thin before pregnancy, they may be more noticeable, since the skin has further to go to accommodate the once-growing belly.      What I did was buy tubs of pure cocoa butter from Wal-Mart.  I don't know if it actually helped or was mostly due to my imagination, but that is what I recommend from experience.  Vitamin E sounds like a GREAT idea, too!  (Wish I'd though of that!)|`|0kuNJQpwaa	Hi, there are lots of things to try, including diet(healing your body from   the inside), exercises and home made creams. Here is one below.     1/2 cup virgin olive oil  - 1/4 cup aloe vera gel  - Liquid from 6 capsules of Vitamin E  - Liquid from 4 capsules of Vitamin A  Mix all the ingredients together in a blender. Pour the mixture into a jar and store it in the  fridge. Apply the oil to the skin where the stretch marks commonly appear which is usually  the stomach, thighs, legs and breasts. If you do this every day, you may reduce stretch  marks.

You're a mom and instead of always being obsessed with your looks,you put your kids first.     If you would like to still look good and be a mom that's possible to,just takes a lot of effort. Finding a nice hairstyle that is easy to maintain might help. And when you go shopping for clothing,skip buying the sweat pants and buy a pair of black dress pants. Just look for sales,so you won't break the bank. Finding an easy and quick make-up routine also.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Go out shopping and buy some nice lingerie, a new outfit, some new shoes, whatever boosts your energy.  That will help.

zhJOZhKEaa	I don't want to call myself an expert in this area by any means...  but I do have a son on the spectrum and believe I am on the spectrum myself.    I know that I personally *have* to have one or more blankets over me to sleep well even when it is very hot.  I even like to have a pillow over my face and many times a 'body pillow' as a blanket... which I imagine is much like a weighted blanket would feel.      My son's diagnosis is Aspergers and he is *much* less affected than your son.  But he also sleeps with a lot of bedding and keeps so many things on his bed that he is balled up in a corner.  (I know I have always loved small spaces as well.)      My son has also had some difficulty getting to sleep that were helped with Melatonin... if you need another option to look into.      But really... I think the weighted blanket sounds like a *wonderful* idea for a spectrum child.  Ever since I first heard of the idea I've vaguely considered getting one for myself.    It just sounds *nice*.      The pressure of the blanket (in my case pillow) just feels like it holds my thoughts in their place so I don't have to fidget or stress not to fidget.  When my thoughts get out of control... I move... and that puts my thoughts back in place.  I have totally different and less 'obvious' stims than your son... but I can 'see' in my mind how much a weighted blanket would sort of 'hold his mind together' instead of moving so he could rest.  I hope that makes a bit of sense to someone other than me.  :)    Hope you can get plenty of other input from spectrum families and professionals!  :)  I'll star the question so that a fabulous contact of mine from both catagories will be sure to see it.|`|6vGg8nZtaa	My son uses one and loves it.  He has autism.  He is fairly low functioning with lots of sensory issues.  What you really want to think about before you buy one are what calms your child.  If you child likes deep pressure and "heavy work", he'll probably really like a weighted blanket.  If he doesn't seek those deep pressure feelings, he may not like it as much.  I bought his six years ago from weighted wearables.  The dreamcatcher's ones the other answers mentioned look nice too.  I've looked into replacing his with one of them.  The nice thing about the weighted wearables blankets is that the weights are in removable tubes.  He didn't even use them when he was 4 or 5 - the blanket was heavy enough without them - now that he's older (11) I use two tubes.  You remove them to wash the blanket.  These blankets aren't cheap, a couple of hundred dollars, but they are worth it when they work!!  That seems cheap when I think of his sleepless nights over the six years he's used it!.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, I've got two sons dx with PDD.NOS and we use the weighted blankets from dreamcatcher and have for 1 yr.  http://www.weightedblanket.net  also there are many ebay stores that make and sell them.  To start the blanket shouldn't exceed more than 10 percent of his body weight so for a 30lb child the blanket at 3 lbs, this is what is recommended, I find the larger the blanket the heavier you need, my 37 lb 3 yr old PDD.NOS son has been using a dreamcatcher weighted blanket that is 5lbs.  Yes it works, very calming.    The other thing that we've found that works is a huggie vest sz medium  http://www.southpawenterprises.com  weights and resistance-bear hug vest    I agree these weighted blankets work if the child responds to deep pressure and heavy work which just about every spectrum person I've ever seen does, but I recognize there must be some that don't.    My 8 yr old son has a 7 lb one that he has had since he was 6 when he weighed 50 lbs, now he weighs 58lbs and is still using it    Alot of sites have/make weighted blankets, the poly fill is the best I would stay away from some of the other things what is nice about dreamcatcher is it is a mom of an autistic spectrum child that started this and he is older now and still uses it and its like 20lbs, the fabrics there is alot of blue because that is calming, and there is alot of high interest fabrics, not much red-not calming etc|`|j0xfBk5Caa	My three year old daughter has SPD and is most likely somewhere on the Autism Spectrum as well, we are waiting on an official diagnosis but our GP thinks Aspergers. I know that with my daughter we tried a weighted blanket and it was a horrid mess. She wasn't able to tolerate the weight and complained of being too hot (not the case but that was all she could think to say) constantly for the week we tried to use it. Luckily I borrowed one to test, I would have been mighty annoyed had I bought my own. Every child is different and some will love the weight while others won't be able to tolerate it at all. I would suggest trying out a heavy feather duvet, or similar blanket, and see how that goes. We eventually came across a vibrating pillow stuffed with Styrofoam balls(similar to a beanbag chair) that my daughter is in love with.    I also second the melatonin advice. Before we started using it I was lucky to have her in bed by midnight and a full night sleep was 4 hours at the most. Since starting her on melatonin she is in bed by nine and sleeps until I wake her at 7:30. Amazing product!
HbaxtX44aa	oh wow i would of lost my ****.i probably would of hit that man,im glad you called the paper,maybe they can give you some other people to contact.i would absolutely contact every team members parents to let them know also.who the hell do they think they are putting those kids in harms way?i would make a much fuss as i possibly could....you got the right idea.|`|xRJQSNJeaa	The HELL he isnt supposed to be doing background check on the coach. Not only should you go to the police ASAP not only should the coach be kicked off the field and what not  he should also  get charged because most offenders have order that there not allowed within 5000 feet of children or some sort. Not only is there a big problem with that but with the comissoner and whoever else knew he was an registered offender and they still let him on the field. Definitely go to the local paper and newstation but you alsos need to go the cops and let it be known.|`|ZZJKTV8laa	the fact that they arent required to do background checks on ANYONE that works that closely with children is beyond me. like i couldnt even get over that to digest that rest.  it is def wrong for him to even think of being a coach knowing he was a registered sex offender and if someone found out ( even though it wasnt against a child) that they no doubt would be concerned and would say something to someone. i don't even know what to say really because if you go to the school board or whoever im sure they are going to tell him he cant coach anymore and its gonna get around hes a registered offender which means him and his family will have to move for sure. the offense wasnt against a child so i guess its kind of a thing that you have to think about the consequences it will do to his family. im not defending him by any means im just saying his offense wasnt against a child (not saying its right against anyone period) and was 15 yrs ago so i dont know.     also i heard that sex offenders had too have some kind of sign in their yard that says they are a sex offender so that their neighbors will know? it sounds obsurd but i didnt know if that was true|`|VzOokYEqaa	im sure if all the parents are aware he will be forced to move on to another job. and it should be mandatory that all the parents be aware who is around their children, especially when this isn't the volunteers sole income. he has no reason to be around kids at all....|`|6sxLBLxgaa	Well you can simply let all the other parents know.  If the commissioner is aware then I guess he is legally allowed to couch, although I think maybe he is not.  Usually sex offenders are not allowed to work with kids though.  Maybe you could look into the laws about that.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I don't agree with them not doing background checks if he is working with children.. regardless of a persons history it should be done.    However, you don't know the details as to what happens so you should assume he is a horrible person.  If you don't want  your kid around him that's fine, but don't ruin whatever future he has, or break down everything he may have built back up.     For all you know he could of gotten in a fight with her an she cried wolf.. bam he has a record for life!  My 18 year old step brother had sex with a 15 year old that told him and everyone else she was 18, she got caught by her mom and to get out of trouble so she said he raped her.  He is now in prison for another 2 years and has to register as a sex offender.. is he a bad person? nope.  The girl has 3 different myspaces lol 3 different towns 3 different ages, and has cried wolf about 2 other guys, however since she said he raped her he is automatically at fault....     you cant just go making assumptions.|`|kEZP3BmBaa	Have you talked to the coach yet?  Maybe he can clear things up for you, because I don't think you know the details.     Like the guy above said, find out the facts before you judge.|`|UUpsa35Daa	If you're trying to get him kicked off for volunteering...than you're just going to have to make it as public as possible (and possibly ruining this man's life for something he already paid for) and hope that the administrators break. But you making it known is no guarantee that they will. I wouldn't go public with it.    And it's not like it's illegal for him to be coaching kids. Not unless he's on probation AND not being allowed to be around kids is a term of his probation.     That's why your only option is to make it public. And like i said, even that's not 100% guarantee. If it doesn't work and you're that against him coaching your kids, it might just come down to you pulling them out. If it were me...i would check into why he's listed as a sex offender. If it didn't have anything to do with kids, i would just leave it.|`|P544Sbmqaa	You should find out details before you start ruining this person's career.  You do realize that many people on the registry actually did nothing wrong.  Do you know that a a 19 year old who has consensual sex with a 17 year old, and the parents of the younger press charges he can be forced to register?  Do you think its fair to ruin a man's career because 10 years ago he had sex with his girlfriend?  Im not saying this is the case, what I am saying is that you should find the details before you crucify him for this.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	if you don't like it just take your kid out.  no need to ruin this guy's job,  maybe send a letter out to the other parents so they can be informed... but let them make their own decisions.      you don't even know what he did... and regardless of what he did, he served his time and it wasn't against a kid.|`|y4Uliyq3aa	There are about 20 Registered Sex Offenders just In my Neighborhood. Don't worry about It.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	UH HELLO!

You have no idea what really happened and it wasn't against a child. It's rather easy to get on that list these days and it could be an old offense. I understand your concerns,I would have them to, but I wouldn't call the paper. Try talking to him about it if it bothers you so much.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	First I am very suprised to hear that they don't do background checks on volunteer coaches and even more so that someone knew this guy was a sex offender. Regardless whether it was against a child or not, that's definately not cool. I would contact a child advocate perhaps. They are all about protecting children and would probably try to help you out.

4DM0yk48aa	It's probably that he's not getting enough sleep for what his body requires.  When our kids were four, both of them needed a *lot* of sleep - at least 12 hours per night. One of them would often want an additional 30-60 minute nap during the day, too.    I'd suggest that you try keeping him awake until about 6:30 or 7:00, and putting him to bed then (after he's had dinner and everything).  Once his body adjusts to that schedule, I bet you'll find that he does great.    (Edit: My assumption writing this is that the behavior you are talking about is typical for him. If it is a temporary thing, it may just be that he needs extra rest to heal from being sick, or because of something else temporary in life - such as a bit of a growth spurt. Of course, as you said, as a good parent you'll take him to the doc if that appears necessary. :o)  )|`|AA11683996	My four year old sleeps a straight 12 hours - 7 till 7|`|6JXrlnYsaa	They have these people called DOCTORS.  Why would you ask a bunch of uneducated strangers?  Isn't your son's health more important than that?|`|DNygQdmVaa	he may be sick and noone realizes it. Or hes going through some kind of phase.    Id take him to the doc.|`|c55O7jqXaa	he may not be sleeping as well as you think at nightime. It would be interesting if you had a video camera that you could set up at night to see exactly what is going on. try doing this several nights in a row. It is like your own sleep study. If you do notice him waking up several times a night that is your reason there and then you need to find out then what is making him wake up several times a night.     Also looking for things like a difference in his breathing- sleep apnea, or nightmares that might be disturbing his sleep, but doesn't remember by morning.     Do you notice any other symptoms? Maybe low on Iron or Vit B16? How is his diet? Does he drink a lot or eat a lot of sugary items that would cause his blood sugar to spike and then come crashing down which can cause sleepiness? How does he do in school?     You say he is cranky? Is he cranky upon waking in the morning like he didn't get enough sleep? Acitivity level at home during the day?    Lost of things to consider. Is he going thru a major growing spurt or complain of pains?|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I would have his thyroid checked & maybe check for anemia, just to be on the safe side. But I don't think that the amount of time is unusual unless he just started doing this recently.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	He's probably just tired from the school day.  There's an old saying about when they sleep, they're growing.  If he has no other symptoms, allow him to sleep.
jNqf8HtDaa	dont stress about it but i would take a test in a few weeks it could be in your head though thats why you shouldnt think about it|`|VhmBMJKxaa	Well if the bleeding only happened for around 24 hours, I would say that it is implantation bleeding, which means you are probably pregnant.    But you said that you had a regular-medium period for three days and the last two were light with browner blood. Which sounds like a period to me. 'older blood' usually comes out later in the cycle which would explain the color.     I would say that it is probably in your head. The nausea could be an effect from the stress you are under, causing 'nervous stomach'. Plus, nausea happens on occasion during your period.    I would wait a while and then try taking a pregnancy test, if you would like to be sure. And the main thing is to remain CALM!    By the way, It was quite unwise of you to have unprotected sex at all, let alone more than once. You should at least use a condom. You don't want to go through all this pain and worry again do you? And what if you do it unprotected again and then it is not a false alarm? What if you got an STD? Think about it.|`|dBdQB4KHaa	Dont wory but later if you are Watch tis it is important.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XghfFjVY_...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZRVNQgrp...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXYc0JojI...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBOAPleF1...

You could take a home pregnancy test if you think it was abnormal, or go to the doctor for a blood test.    Some women have implantation bleeding which may seem like a light period, but it isn't usually red blood.
xfpJGBfwaa	You don't need a reason.  He's probably glad you have a condom.  He probably would've given you one himself if he didn't feel too embarrassed about the subject.      Let me tell you something.  When I was 25, I told my mom I lost my virginity  at 14, and you know what she said?  "Oh, well, I'm glad.  I thought you weren't normal."  She actually worried about me because I had her convinced I hadn't lost my virginity until I was in college.      Parents are glad when you take precautions.  So don't treat them like fools.    The fact that he left it under your pillow and didn't say anything means that he respects your privacy.  The best thing to do is say nothing.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	uhm, well you cant deny it!  And sounds a little fishy to me so if I were your parent I would not believe the story!    He most likely wont bring it up, unless you two are close.  If he does tell him you were experimenting and you got it from your sex-ed class.  Possibly tell him the teacher/ counselor told you guys to open them and see exactly how they worked, so when the time came you would know what to do!    assure him you are not sexually active nor do you plan on being sexually active right now!|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	he'll know if it was used or not otherwise you'd be dead already|`|EkXQVZU5aa	Tell him you love bannanas, but only after hiding in your closet, jupming out and screaming it, effectively coming out of the close, because only you can prevent forest fires|`|AA10244380	You can tell when a condom has been used in the "proper" way and when it was just played with like a balloon.

You can mention it to him, "Hey did you throw away my babana flavored condom? hahaha"  or not, it's up to you.|`|PwrF9OtWaa	you got it in health class and blew it up like a balloon and you haven't seen it since. tell him you think it's funny that he found it (if he says anything).    he'll be put off if you just act casual about it.|`|MA3KcLUJaa	LOL.

Honestly, you'll probably get a "talking to" but I promise, after you tell your dad, he'll wait until your nowhere around and laugh just like I'm doing :-)|`|AA12029875	thank him for leaving it.  but, maybe you saved yourself the father and son talk.  he doesn't have to tell you about condoms now.  It probably  eased his mind.|`|xRJQSNJeaa	I would tell him exactly what you just told us. That should convince him pretty well. If he trusts you enough to be telling the truth and not making up a lie about it being well used then you should tell him the story and he should definitely have a laugh and say okay. But if he thinks that you lying even though your not just say that at least I'm doing it safely I hope this helps and everything goes ok.|`|GgB6bLhTaa	I know this is the hardest thing to do, but just tell him the truth if you feel the need to bring it up at all.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Just tell him what you told us also tell him the story behind it.|`|H6LxeWZfaa	tell him the truth! I mean, its not like you really DID use it.  only tell him if he asks though.  well, unless you really feel the need to lol.    p.s  find a better hiding spot next time! :)|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Tell him the TRUTH.
VMxqr5iWaa	Go see your OB/GYN to get a blood test. And talk to them about your problem.
mFC2RBL3aa	The prenatal vitamins that the doctors prescribe.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	they are all the same|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Flintstones|`|290OPLfuaa	The doctor that oversees the pregnancy should have the best answer.|`|MPc0kS1vaa	i take neevo. they work very well for me. my baby is perfectly healthy and i have a nice level of energy.

Which ever you do.|`|AA10458750	Even if you are shaving like you regularly do, the preg is messing with your oil glands. Thats probably whats causing the irratation, not to mention the overall hormonal changes in the body is gonna make you itch anyway. I would get it checked out to be safe b/c it may be a yeast infection on it's way.
23C49tEOaa	First... I have to say congratulations for having the courage to bring five boys to the doctor's office.  I only have one two year old and sometimes i'm amazed at the things that she can get into in a matter of two seconds.  While we can all wish that our children never acted up and never do things that are inappropriate, but things happen.  We all should all understand that two-year-olds are clever and very curious and not all of them behave 100% of the time.  How do we know that the boy was not also disciplined for getting into the trash?  We can not judge this mother because of something that her son did while at the doctors office.  I am concerned about where the biohazard container would have been in order for the two year old to have access to it.  That is completely unacceptable and I would advise you to speak to your child's doctor about the placement of harmful item inside of their office... They wouldn't leave syringes down in a bottom drawer would they????  I hope not.  As for your son putting it in his mouth, until you get bloodwork back, we can just hope for the best.... But as old as the broom was, I wouldn't think you have anything to be worried about although i'm not a doctor.  As for future appts, would it be possible for your fifteen year old to stay at home to take care of the younger boy?  I understand that there are possibly a lot of factors in your situation, but if that was possible it might take some stress away, allowing you to focus on just the three middle aged ones during the appointment.  Just a suggestion....  I hope everything comes out well for you.  Good luck!|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Why on earth are you blaming the doctors office.  You should have been watching your kid better!    Sounds like he should have been with a bbsitter instead!  I am sure he will be fine!  It is NOT the doctors fault your kid was digging through the garbage.    My children know NOT to go digging in the garbage, maybe he taught himself a lesson!|`|AA11703652	WOW, that is TRULY disgusting!  Your son is likely fine, and they did do the blood tests, right?  But not to be mercenary, but who's PAYING for those blood tests?  They should not be charging those to you or your insurance, since their actions required them.  If you are at all litigious, you might consult a lawyer.  At least consider changing doctors...|`|jL8RbY1Uaa	Oh you poor thing ! You must be very worried !    I am not a sciece person. But, i have read somewhere that if germs are exposed in air, they do die after 3 days. So, if it was a old trash, i think you need not worry.    If you are still worried, take blood test. It will give you a pece of mind.
