So I was accepted into a PhD program in 2010- with enough stipend to live off of and pay for my mortgage. I was also offered $15,000 to carry me over for the year as part of a grant initiative. However, this is not enough money to pay my mortgage and living expenses for the year, especially when I'm still dealing with loans from college and my masters programs, and they won't be held off again until I'm a full time student again. Additionally, I don't know if I can sell the house right now given the housing crisis, nor do I know what I'd do about apartments or something in the meantime.       Are there any ideas for how to hold over? What kind of jobs would take someone who said they were only available for a year, and may pay 30k or so? Are there any loans or grants which could help someone in this awkward situation?

One 79.99%, one 15.01%, and 5% down.  Never had PMI.  All I have left is the 80% loan BUT since prices have fallen I certainly owe well more than 80%.  Truth be told I owe probably 97% to even 105% of my homes value.      I'm wondering if my lender can/will start PMI on me?  I can't see the banks being dumb enough to force even more people into foreclosure by springing about $200 a month in PMI on people in trouble.  But then again, then have been pretty dumb so far...... (So have borrowers, before anyone rants on that subject.)      I'd survive the PMI as long as I am still employed, but boy would I be unhappy.      Thoughts?

My friend bought a dying bar in 2007 and had every intention of turning it around to get rid of the riff raff that hangs out in there...

Unfortunately, economic times are tough and the bar is sliding out of their fingers. They really need something to change the pace! I hate to see them lose their butts in this!

20090306164047AAtA23k	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Personal finance question.?	I am going to get my BS in Physician Assistant and then get my MS degree 2 years later. The thing is that I am going to be managing my parents' one family house because they want me to help them with payments in a couple of years. That means that I would be able to convert it into a two family house when I have the money and rent it all out. But I plan to buy a two family house before this where I would live and rent one portion. So wouldn't I be in a very good position given that I start of with two 2 family houses by the time I turn around 25? I then would try to break even with mortgage payments and continue buying property to get wealthier. What do you think? Thanks.

20090227083207AAQq6mB	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	My banks branch manager revealed personal information to a relative. Any recourse?	I recently set up an electronic funds transfer for my mortgage. When I realized it was for the incorrect amount, I placed a stop pay, following the directions of the bank and paid the fee of $25. After checking for a couple days to make sure the EFT presented and did NOT pay, I called my mortgage company and set up another EFT for the correct amount.       When I followed up a couple days later, I discovered that both had been paid and I was in overdraft for almost $300. Upon discovering this, I contacted the bank. The EFT was for the exact same amount and the exact same mortgage company. When the next EFT payment presented, they paid it as well, thus the overdraft.      I talked to the bank branch manager, who happens to be friends with my brother-in-law (golf buddies). I explained this to him and he informed me that since the EFT had been re submitted without a number the second time around, it was no longer the EFT that I had stopped payment on, so it was paid. I disagreed by arguing that since an EFT was presented for the same amount and to the same company the very next day I should have at least been notified if they were going to pay it, before they did so.      We had a heated exchange on the phone after he informed me that I would have to wait 7-10 days before I would have the original $ back in my account from the mortgage company. I pleaded that I had to have money because I have a foster son that I am legally obligated to provide for and I had no money for groceries, gas, bills, etc. and asked if he could just deposit a minimum amount into my account to cover essentials till the money was back from the mortgage company, which he declined to do. He admitted the mortgage company agreed to reverse the transaction.      He accused me of not taking care of business and that the bank employees could not be expected to "read my mind" and further told me I should bank somewhere that could read minds.      Two days later while speaking with my sister, she asked me about the "problem " at the bank! She proceeded to tell me that the banker had explained to my brother-in-law that I had overdrafted my acount and was complaining about it! He wanted to smooth things over with my brother in law and make sure that it didn't affect thier relationship. My brother-in-law is a financial advisor and broker and makes mucho $ and banks with this same bank.      Do I have any legal recourse for this breach of privacy on the part of the banker?

This will probably be quite long so if you don't want to read a bunch of text then ..I don't know...its important to read the details in this ...Thanks      My 17 yr old sister has Chronic Lyme Disease & Bipolar II with quick cycling. As long as she stays on her medication she is fine. Lyme disease gives her lots of very painful joint pain in her fingers, wrists and ankles with rashes and other problems. Most of the time she is fine though.      She is pretty and well-groomed, good mannered, and is very responsible despite her illnesses. She is a 3.9 GPA student as well. She goes to an independent charter school this year though that works partly through the local community college.      The problem is she also has slight OCD behavior, when it comes to food and such. She is an amazing baker and cook, but it has to all be done exactly her way, exactly perfect. She takes the time to garnish things and make them pretty, especially if there are guests.      I can't see her working in a food environment because she works slower at making food to ensure perfection.      However she is very very organized when it comes to paperwork and so on. She is an extremely fast typer with excellent grammar and vocabulary.      She's also quite creative when it comes to design and such. Her possible careers later in life include some kind of designer, or nurse (because its a stable job).       She's an auto freak and loves cars, especially F1 and exotics.      She doesn't NEED a job because our dad makes a lot lot lot of money, but I think it would be good for her. She loves Chanel and I think it would be good for her to buy some of it by herself and put some money back for herself. She has our moms old Porsche Boxster (i know..) and it would be good for her to pay some of the gas and so on.      So does anything come to mind? I have to keep her illnesses in mind as well.       She used to volunteer at the Red Cross a lot but I think having an actual job would be better.

20090227083043AA22hgb	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How many days does it take on average from the time a 600K house goes under contract to the closing date?	I told my husband most people settle within 30-45 days.   I base that on our previous experiences and noticing when    the smaller houses go under contract in our neighborhood and when new people have moved in. He thinks I'm making   these numbers up. We can't move until our daughter finishes school in June. He thinks if we got a contract soon we would negotiate settlement for the end of May - early June.  Sure every buyer is different but what is happening now for those people actually buying houses?  Are you at more risk for losing a buyer when you take this long to go to closing?  There is an extended stay hotel   in our area but because 30 days there is almost twice   our mortgage I wouldn't want to stay too long.  I realize   this may be viewed as a wasted question because the odds are that our house may not sell anytime soon.  I'd rather collect the facts and opinions while I'm waiting.  Thanks for helping.

20090227085020AAOpV1O	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Shouldn't' we all have the same HOA fees?	We just found out our HOA fees are different from our next door neighbor.  He pays 450, we pay 600.  We moved in last July.  The bylaws state that the fees are due half in Feb, half in Aug.  Now they want them all up front.  The fees were 300 in June and they bumped them up to 600 for SOME of us.  The bylaws also state they can only increase the HOA dues by 15% unless the HOA association (including us homeowners) vote and 2/3 say we can bump it higher.  No meeting was ever called, no vote ever taken.  I find it interesting that the people that were already here only got a 15% increase and we got a double.  Shouldn't we all pay the same?  We do not have any extra amenities.  Do we have any rights or are we hosed?

20090306205532AAaVhOb	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	If you worked/lived in 2 states, should the sum of state wages equal your federal wages?	On a W-2 form, should the state wages (box 16 of the W-2) add up to, or be close to the total Federal wages (box 1 of the W-2)?  I have an instance where I moved in August, but the sum of the two state wages from my W-2 is 75% more than my actual earning by itself.  When I use Turbotax, the software wants to add the two state's wages together when I file the state returns - resulting in me owing more than I beleive I should.  Any advice would be appreciated.
