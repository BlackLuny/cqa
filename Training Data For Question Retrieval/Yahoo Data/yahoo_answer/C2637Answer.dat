But in particular, yellow is a little bit more uncommon for the boxster (vs like silver or blue etc.) so you might have to look just a little harder.      For a Boxster in good condition with good-average mileage, you're most likely looking at a starting price in the higher teens to around $20,000.

Failing that replace the belt-it's a simple enough job|`|xmldMIWOaa	Change it any way.  If its been slipping and squealing the friction face of the belt will have been polished due to the excess heat and will start to crack and age prematurely, it will not grip as well due to the polished surface and even if retightend may still squeal under load.    Older V type belt cars with high mileage engines could have worn pulley's that means the belts require more frequent re-tensioning/changes.    Get a new belt fitted, and make sure its tightened correctly .  If its got a spring loaded idler pulley on it get it checked out as well, the spring may have gone soft and will not be keeping the belt at the correct tension .|`|GiOamMFzaa	Do you know any violinists or cello players?

AA10713928	I think you should qualify this question.  It's ludicrous to say that Suzuki makes quality cars.

skfHV92caa	Normally when you get that code you will have to replace the MAF sensor.  However, I would try to remove and clean it first with some MAF cleaner.  Sometimes cleaning it will help it.

csmEH6qsaa	Electric motors, stereo speakers and windshield wiper motors often cause magnetic interference to the compass. Try to keep them as far as you can from the compass.  Any electronics could cause a problem with the compass but speakers are the worse - the magnets will pull the compass card. To see how much they effect your compass you could remove the radio check the compass heading and then reinstall and turn on to see if it changes the compass heading.    Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	You have to be practical about it, mount any electronics as far away from the compass as possible. You may notice that the compass heading will  change when you transmit on the radio, in addition to any error caused by the close proximity to each other. This can be overcome by mounting electronics like the radio overhead in the t top if so equipped. If you can get the radio mounted far enough away you can get a compass adjuster to come on your boat and "swing" the compass adjusting error out of it and making a deviation table for you. I ended up putting a flux gate compass in my boat made by KVH. End of problem unless it fails.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Do you even know HOW a compass WORKS?  It's the MAGNETS in the RADIO and other elecronics that effect the COMPASS... it's NOT the compass the effects the other stuff.    NO.. you can pile the compass on top of the speakers for the stereo if you want.. BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE IT.  The compass doesnt REALL CARE HOW WIDE YOUR CONSOLE IS.. you either mount it in the clear OR IT'S NOT USABLE.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	on the contrary the electronic devices will affect the compass. there should be as much space as possible .it wont mess up your electronics, just makes the compass off check it out .While tied to a dock remove the electronic device and then look at the compass take note of the heading then compare this heading again after you place the electronics back

333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Double clutching isn't used any more in new vehicles unless you are driving a heavy truck without syncros in the transmission.      To double clutch you have to be moving then push in the clutch, shift to neutral, release clutch, rev engine to match speed of next gear, push in clutch and shift to next gear, release clutch and apply throttle.      Most truck drivers don't do this they slip shift without using the clutch at all, if your good you can shift faster and smoother than double clutching.|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Absofrikenlotsy Yes It's very bad|`|4b38d97174c949f1f13c222090982820aa	it means you push down the pedal and pull it out of gear, then let up and push back down while sliding into gear. - a big waste of time during the shift. unless your driving a semi. or dump truck.|`|ab226445523dd359acfc93c66ef57424aa	with modern synchromesh boxes it is a total waste of effort
dQUISy3Haa	It is probably the clockspring, but you really need a diagnosis of the system in case it's not. I would take it in to have it checked, probably cost $70-80 for diagnosis and if it is the clockspring, about $200-250 to replace. It may be covered under a recall. Have the dealer check. Good luck.|`|xJgILr5faa	Take the negative cable off of battery to reset electronic system for  five min.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	I would be very careful if you unhook the battery cable. Doing that and then turning the key for the first time could set off the air bag and it ain't pretty. In layman's turns that bag has an explosive charge in it and will rock your world if it goes off.   The clock spring is only wired to the airbag and your horn turn signal and so on are wired through you turn signal lever that is part of what is called a combination switch.  Yes on some newer jeeps the horn goes off if you push on the airbag part but that is separate front the clock spring, it uses a contact switch plate,  I would not get the airbag system disconnected, it may save your life one day.  I would take it to the dealer and get it fixed. Just because they have the right equipment and training for this kind of problem and you don't want this repair screwed up. trust me|`|Dvf3cPshaa	yes it is still possible. although they both go through the clockspring but on different wires.  possibly under chrysler recall to.  worth checking on.
kIy2bdiraa	No, if you are barely tapping it.  Think of if this way, you will hit a lot of potholes on the road going 70-80 mph.  Your car is probably designed to take bumps at speeds up to 100mph.  Also your car was designed to be able to slam on the brakes and lock up the tires from similar speeds.  Both of these things will put a LOT more force on your car than those little taps against the bumper.    The only thing that I would warn you about is if you have a car the cement stop may be higher than the front bumper of the car.  This might cause you to scrape, or worse case break a radiator.|`|LygV4VOOaa	Not bad at all.    You may scrape your plastic air dam underneath the front of the car, its designed to throw air up into the radiator, its also designed to take some punishment.|`|4WkfePR8aa	Its fine for the tires, but it WILL screw up your alignment.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it won,t hurt nothing at that speed.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Will not hurt your tires.  Just be careful not to scrape the underside of your car before the tires contact the parking bumpers.  Again, will not hurt your tires.  Tires are very durable these days.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	if one hits anything to hard yes bad for tire and wheel but just a rolling bump no not so bad but still wouldnt hurt not to so think of it like this if you bounce inside car you hit it to hard|`|cQqc1Qicaa	Seems alright, but if your vehicle has an automatic transmission, doing this may preload the parking pawl.  Better to shift to Neutral and ease off the brake for a second so that the tires aren't compressed against the divider before shifting to Park.
dQrBlk4qaa	You can buy conditioner, and it will work well.    Remember, though, that by far the best way to preserve the finish is to buy the correct washing products (that means no dishwashing soap to wash the car with), using the correct cleaning tools (meaning soft chamois and detailing brushes, and not dad's old tidy-whitey underwear), and proper post-wash prep before your protectant application.     Do all this, and then you can condition, or apply several coats of the best wax you can afford. Yes - several. One is good, two is better, and three will do the trick.     Finally, if you can, protect the finish by parking out of the sun and away from any sap-dropping trees.|`|5zzeH5gnaa	just keep it clean and waxed. don't fall for any of those stupid products that cost a lot and make lots of promises. black paint is beautiful but requires the most maintenance. first and foremost you must keep it waxed. and always dry it when you wash it. the sun can etch water spots in black paint quickly, keeping it waxed will help prevent this. just do this, wash, dry with a good chamois, and wax it in the shade, and use a good clearcoat wax like Meguiars. remember, if you take care of your paint it can last as long as your car.
PIzz6hWFaa	A phone book will either stop a bullet completely, like a .38 or a .22 caliber, or even if a .44 magnum round makes it through, it will have been slowed down enough that it will do far less damage, or maybe even be stopped by a high grade leather jacket. And if the .44 was a hollow point slug, it will have already expanded by the time it comes through, and will not be able to penetrate you.    Don't misunderstand me....even if a heavier hitting bullet doesn't penetrate you, it is still like getting hit with a sledgehammer.    Also, even if the books could do the job, where the books met would be a weak spot. Just my luck, one hit would take out my kidneys and lungs, even iff 20 shots at my head were stopped. Either way, it's "Lights Out".|`|PVe6jK78aa	If Michael Weston does it it's good enough for me.|`|AA12095978	I saw that episode last night.. sounds interesting doesn't it?

AA12095978	that damn v6 motor..    ok.. OE plugs are NGK laser platnum plugs.  they run about $13each.  I recommend you put the exact same plugs back in.    the plug change on the firewall side of the motor is easy, AFTER you remove the plenum (aluminum thing in middle of engine).  you'll need new plenum gaskets too.  there's like 12 bolts holding it down, and once thats off you can get to the rear plugs easily.  I recommend new plug wires at the same time.   this car isn't cheap to maintain.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I swear you are going to ask a question.

AA12261615	if your going to buy one get the v-8 version their a lot better for power and performance and not too bad on gas either,the v-6 version is alright for what it is,but it seems bit under-powered sometimes,the v-8 version has plenty of power and comes with many more options,good luck.|`|3qGdN6xMaa	Well the v8 is preferable and also more expensive.  And depending on what you are willing to spend, the v6 might be a better deal for you and the performance is ok and economy is better, like if you are even thinking about economy when getting a car like this :-)    From what I've seen the v6 vs v8 prices I've seen difference of about $5000 to get those extra 2 cylinders, but if you are a normal macho american male you'd be expected to pony up for 'em.    Details of prices you should talk to a dealer, sales aren't that great lately and they will probably try and make you a good deal.|`|6p15hVlRaa	I test drove both and settled on the v6.  The Hemi was a lot of fun but I could see myself getting in a LOT of trouble with that much power!  After coming down from the "Hemi High", my practical side kicked in and decided I needed better gas mileage than the Hemi would provide (and the price on the v6 was more practical too).  The 6 cyl has enough get-up-and-go for what I need it for.  Great car either way!!|`|9EYyNZrraa	the v8 is Better|`|d1dd02060cdb51c9ddd303817ecbf6eaaa	I have an 07 HEMI R/T with road and track package. And a 08 SVT 3.5 V6 Charger. I love my HEMI but the 3.5 is a better all around car. If I had to give up one right now I'd give up the R/T.  At 61 I've owned a lot of cars but these new Chargers are the best and most comfortable cars I've ever owned.|`|AA12377112	I'm going to have to highly disagree with alcusswhen. I own a 2007 Charger R/T with Road&Track package and have been in several v6's. I can say that the R/T (v8) is definitely a better option. The seats in the road and track are a million times better than those available to the SXT and base R/T. The only I wish is that I would have gone with the SRT for even more power. The mileage difference is not very much at all either. Most of the people that I know get 18/28mpg and I get 16/24mpg. Of course I've had a few tanks where I've gotten around 11mpg, but that was because I was having too much fun.
skfHV92caa	If you have rear abs (RABS) the sensor is located in the rear differential (at the top).  If you are talking about 4-wheel abs, you will have a sensor in the rear differential and at both front wheels.  Hope this helps.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I find it hard to believe you are trying to throw parts at the ABS system.    You need a Ford factory scanner to diagnose ABS system issues and there is more than one sensor related to the system as mentioned already.
WO68RZdIaa	That DOT   is too short. It is missing the last group of numbers that would show the manufacturing date.     Additional: I agree with the first poster, if this tire is sold in the US, it would still have a US DOT   & there should be a series of 4 numbers following the last letter.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	That is the manufacturer code (and plant code), the date is built into the last 4 numbers.  There are no alpha characters in the date code.    The final three numbers (four beginning in 2000) denote the date the tire was produced. The first two indicate the week, and the last numbers specify the year.    It should look something like 4BT6 EXWR 4802 which would be the 48th week of 2002.     Even if they were made in Canada, if they are being used on US roadways, the DOT numbers have to be the same format.    The last 4 numbers are sometimes smaller and placed inside an oval.  They may also only be on one sidewall of the tire.  Look again, and also look at the inward facing sidewall with a flashlight.
ece6164651e8c46ee0724690594ca683aa	You should never say to the person who is giving you the test:   Get in, sit down, shut up and hold on. They don't like that sort of thing. No, I'm just joking!

I know that there is one for speeding (I think you get a warning/lose points at 5 over and fail at 10 over)    There are a lot of things that will lose you points though.
fbxqLErlaa	According to article below, you should get about 28 mpg on the highway with your Cavalier.  Mapquest gives the trip mileage of 2400 miles.  So you will need 86 gallons.  Just be on the safe side figure a trip distance of 2500 miles and 26 mpg.  This means about 97 gallons needed for the trip.  One way.    Figure about 200 gallons of gas.  Around my area (Northwest Indiana) gas is $1.89 a gallon.  As you can see I would budget about $400 US for your round trip gas costs.    If I may is there any reason you are driving verses flying?  Figuring in cost of gas, wear and tear and road food, it just may be cheaper and much faster to fly than drive.  But I do not know your reason for driving.  Shame you don't have more time to make stops along the way.    I wish you the best of luck and welcome to the USA.  Still sounds like a great trip.  You will be amazed at the sights you will see during your trip.  One part of your planning I would suggest is to cross the Rocky Mountains during the day.  Safer and much better for seeing the sights of the mountains.  Apply Rain-X to your windows before your trip.  Get a set of clip-on sunglasses to go over your regular sunglasses.  Really helps when you are driving into the sun.  Drink lots of water.  I would bring a cooler.  Eat lightly to keep your blood sugar from crashing and getting sleepy.  Bring a pillow to put behind your back.  Most cars have very little low back support especially Chevys.  I use a Thermo-Rest inflatable back pad.

JUST BECAUSE ITS 4 WHEEL DRIVE, DOESN'T MEAN YOU WON'T GET STUCK!!!        it probably is working. the reason why you probably didn't feel the front wheels spin out is cause they have more traction than the rear wheels. the rear wheels have less traction than the front because the front wheels have more weight on top of them. more weight on the wheels means more traction.|`|BKTx9IsZaa	Have someone look at the back wheels to see if they are turning independently when you're in the car driving it.|`|XjgQ3jDZaa	The best way to tell if 4 wheel drive is working is to put the vehicle in 4 wheel drive while stopped, turn your steering wheel all the way to the left or right and let off the brake (with the vehicle in gear).

ukjFjzqNaa	You can install a new airfilter and other products and if you could , do install a turbo to awaken the sleeping monster|`|AA11151305	WRX pipes are usually formed on a turbo-back design and flow characteristics.  You do not have a turbo, so the exhaust will not help you.    To save money and see noticeable gains try this:  Power is formed by smoothing airflow- Ram air intake (not that hot air sucking short ram, a cold air complete system) every 1 degree of temperature decrease is 10% horsepower gain    Header back 2 3/4 inch pipe to a non restrictive muffler (any larger and your engine cannot push the exhaust pulse out of the tip, it will backlog your system)    Next strip your interior of all un-needed items such as the rear seats and rear belts, carpet and rear door panels to reduce your weight and 60' time.    Heat wrap your intake and first 4' of exhaust      As far as cheap goes that is all I can imagine we've tried on our stock class solo cars.    Good Luck
4WkfePR8aa	All wheel drive is based on a front wheel drive platform with a center differential instead of a transfer case attached to the trans-axle.  It does about the same as four wheel drive but each tire can travel at a different speed because of a viscous coupling that lets the rear slip.  It is much more suited for on-road traction and four wheel drive is usually only for off road or extreme weather conditions.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	see wikipedia, and no.

Common for the hoses to fall off at the front diff and the steel lines to rub thru on the frame.
dQUISy3Haa	Your best bet is to get a seat frame assembly from a junkyard. The seat frame is the same from 93 to 97. The junkyard will be about $100, less if you pull it yourself. It costs about $400-500 for the seat track from the dealer plus the labor to install it will be another $250-300. Good luck.|`|f2b602340ec1c3f14c6da18edee430f0aa	If its a cable, maybe less than a hundred. If its the seat mechanism, you are looking at several hundred dollars.|`|plccXIVSaa	that will depend on what is wrong with them.|`|UU76HDwoaa	I like C-Tech's suggestion.    Without pulling the seat, you can't truly know what is wrong.  Asking for a cost is writing a blank check to a shop to fix it.    I don't know your level of skills.  I personally would pull the seat and put it on the work bench.  Then I'd apply power to each position of the seat to see what is the problem.      Once I have a clue to what is wrong,  time to visit my local junkyard.  The place is a Pick and Pull.  If the seat is in bad shape, I'd look for a good seat to swap out.  I'd also grab some spare parts on what failed.  It isn't a guarantee the replacement seat is going to work either.  This will give me the parts I need to make one good working seat.    If you don't have skills to do the job, perhaps finding a local junkyard that might be willing to swap out the seat and give you some sort of guarantee.

AA12359560	If you are hearing a siren sound instead of the horn honking, then you have an aftermarket alarm.  I'm guessing you don't have a key fob or you would have known you have an alarm, so it is possible that the previous owner installed an alarm and as most people do, lost the fobs and just never armed the alarm again.  When you changed the battery, it activated this aftermarket alarm.  Before I tell you ways to deactivate an aftermarket alarm, let me tell you about the factory alarm in your Cavalier.  Your Cavalier is equipped with the chevy passlock system.  In brief, there is an optical sensor in your ignition that recognizes the cut of your key to prevent theft.  There is an "Anti Theft" indicator light in your instrument cluster - this is why you think you have a factory alarm.  This light only indicates that you have the passlock system.  There are a few ways to turn off an aftermarket alarm.  Without the key fob, all you can do is to put it into "valet mode" which is kind of like putting the system in hibernation.  First, disconnect your battery again, put the key in the ignition, turn the key forward to the on position (past the position where you can listen to the radio, and before all the way where your car would start cranking) and re-connect the battery.  If there is no siren, then turn the key forward and start the car.  Look for a red LED light somewhere on your dash to stay lit (not blinking).  It is now in valet mode and your car is as it was before you changed the battery before.  If this doesn't work,  some of the older aftermarket alarms can be disabled by turning the key to the on position and back to off and repeat for a total of three times. (with the battery connected) If both of those don't work you will need to find either a silver toggle switch or a small round black button - normally mounted somewhere under the dash around where your left foot would go.  Try to leave your finger on the button and turn the ignition forward to on, or with the ignition forward push the button (or flip the toggle switch).  As with the first method, you will know you have succeeded when the red LED stays on without blinking. Good luck.  Once you have the car in valet mode, take the car to a stereo shop and have the alarm removed (unless you don't mind repeating the above whenever your battery dies or gets replaced).  Most shops will only charge you 1 hour labor to remove the alarm.|`|AA11647021	Go to the dealer parts dept, and see if about getting a replacement keyfob and to have the new fob programmed rather then removing this equipment from your car, I would at least give it a try before removing an anti theft device, and will only help on the resale also, good luck|`|AA12091047	lol... i had the same problem with my chrysler imperial. all i had to do was go lock and unlock my driver side door..lol but anyway it should tell you in the owners manual|`|AA10006876	Check the Fuse Box there should be a fuse label Anti-theft or Alarm remove the fuse or it could also meant that it might need to replace the fuse or have the wrong one on there.

The rating is defined as the current a lead-acid battery at that temperature can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt battery).<br>  <br>  The battery's CCA capacity can be used to estimate the battery's remaining service life. Your car has a minimum CCA rating used to sustain the current to start your car. In cold weather, having a battery with low CCA output becomes more of a problem since voltage drops with temperature.<br>  <br>  For reliable cold weather starting, most vehicles require 400 to 600 cold cranking amps. Larger displacement engines require more cranking amps. Some batteries are rated up to 1000 CCA, but may sacrifice reserve capacity to achieve high short term outputs.<br>  <br>  In summation, the battery is still good for a limited time, but it is in danger of failing. Personally I would not let it get below 400. If you currently face very cold weather conditions, I would suggest getting a new battery as soon as convenient.<br>  <br>  Good of you to ask and I wish you good luck in your car starting endeavors.|`|ek99vipMaa	they are lying to you you could always just purchase distilled water and add to the water levels underneath those rectangular covers that say do not open I do it just make sure you are careful not to spill it and wear chemical goggle and old clothes. the biggest misconception about maintenance free batteries is that you can't still do maintenance on them there used to be screw on caps for each cell on old batt. but they realized that most ppl were to lazy to fill the levels and that they could sell them a "new" batt. every time the levels went down so they covered the holes and called the batteries maint. free|`|MG0vew3taa	buy a battery charger, you can test it by letting sum 1 charge u up, by jumper cable charge, if all your lights are bright with beeps, it needs charging but should be good, take the end of the cables and cross em, if they spark up violently, its good, if its dull it may be bad|`|GfkQOWTLaa	you will have to buy one eventually. but i think the battery that your using right now is still in good shape. have a new one laying around just in the trunk just in case. |`|1yWdvMrBaa	Well if your skeptical, while at the autoparts store they will load test your battery for free.

Ase certified can be gained as fast as you can pass the test.. a smart person can do it after getting out of trade school, but to be fully certified takes 2 years (2 years of school equals one year).

AA11882026	I think you're a minor. First you enroll in driver's ed. If you have it at your highschool, great. If not, you can take it at a drivers education place (there's probally at least 1 in your area) or online. After you complete that, you get a pink slip. Take your pink slip and go to the drivers enducation place and enroll into driver's training (actual driving). Once you have paid the tuition, they will give you a white slip. So now you have a white and pink slip. Pick up a driver's license application form and fill it out. When you are ready, take those three items with an ID (passport, etc) your social security card, and money for your fee (mines is $26) take the learner's permit test. If you pass, you get your learner's permit. After that, do your 6 hours behind the wheel training with your instructor (that you enrolled in). Practice 60 (or was it 50?) hours of driving with your parents or someone 25+ years old. 10 hours of it has to be at night. After 6 months of practicing, take your final written and driving test at the DMV. Pass, and you get your lincense!|`|AA11336269	Driving license you mean?  Normally you can enroll to the driving school and they can help you to apply for that. In my country in the Philippines it is like that. You can also apply by yourself to LTO if you know already how to drive and you will take the written exam and Actual driving exam. In my case" I took a driving school for 10 hours total, one hour a day, then they help me to apply for non professional driving license. But the cost are different when you apply by yourself or needs help of the driving school.

QOqvZybJaa	First check to be sure the rubber advance stop is not missing or broken. Remove the rotor, springs and advance weights to look at it. If there is only a small metal pin in the advance slot the rubber stop is missing. It must be replaced if it is. <br>  <br>  Make sure the top piece that the rotor screws to moves freely back and forth. It is common on HEI distributors for this piece to rust to the distributor shaft. If it is stuck or sticky remove the gear and shaft. Clean and polish the shaft and lubricate with moly grease. Replacing the springs and vac advance is a good idea also.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	some slack in the distributor drive gear could cause a  problem or a blocked and or damaged vacuum advance. |`|AA11980483	Sounds like timing to me..<br>  Perhaps your old distributor won't hold position.|`|QzAdWvW0aa	Yes the distributor can cause spark knock. It is one of the more mis understood parts on a car other than the carburetor. First off, the reason for spark knock is either detonation or preignition. Either one will destroy an engine and quickly. I do not recommend you driving this engine until you get the problem corrected. The reason it is running worse by the time you get it home is because your problem is increasingly getting worse as you drive. You are building heat in the engine which leans the fuel out more than it is when it is cold. Timing set to high will do this. But too much compression will also do it. You could have sharp spots in the combustion Chambers and that  will will also cause the problems.<br>  <br>  Your distributor needs to be checked out by a qualified mechanic. He needs to check for correct initial timing. he needs to check for rate of advance and when it starts its advance. He also needs to check your total timing. Most small blocks shouldn`t be run over 36 to 38 degrees total advance. You will have to go to the book to check on the initial and rate.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	If the distributor's set too far ahead in spark advance, you will get engine knocking. Use a timing light to set the distributor correctly.<br>  |`|qICCYs66aa	How old? Does it have points? If so gap them correctly, look for a crack in the distr. cap/rotor, check vacuum line from the spark advance also.|`|5rYAL1WCaa	If your mechanical advance or vacuum advance is binding your distributor could cause spark knock. Hope this helps|`|jMkCFLxUaa	An old cap and rotor with some corrosion built up inside will give you a reduced spark output, but it sounds more like you need to have the timing set.

If this is your first bike, buy the one you like to look at and then later buy a bigger version of it to chop.  The larger the bike the better for making a cool fast chopper.  Choppers were invented to be fast that is why guys chopped the unwanted parts off!!!|`|3OFxasXHaa	they're all good bikes, best go sit on them and see which you like best yourself, the rest will be personal opinions from all of us.... and they are just our own opinions, not yours<br>  (my opinion says sportster, i have... and have had several others... and prefer them over others)|`|n0nT5rTCaa	The Harley would be the best investment. By the bikes you've chosen it seems you want a small bike. The 883 is the best small bike you have listed. It has more power and sounds better, plus, it's a Harley. If your planning to customize it later you should definitely go with the Sportster.|`|lgXJCNGlaa	Just want to point out that Harley 883s nowadays do not hold their value as much as people think like a bigger Harley may do.<br>  <br>  You would actually pay less in maintenence for a Suzuki C50 or a Kawasaki 900 than any Harley, so consider that in your budget in the long run.|`|3IyPr2rUaa	As far as it being your 1st - I think a Night Train -2003 and up - maybe slightly modified - would be good - easy and smooth ride .

79ea0c5bd465a3cc7dc981539f760385aa	"Park" in cars is a little tooth that is moved into a series of spline in the transmission.    Big trucks and buses are to heavy for that kind of parking technique.  Typically these vehicles rely on "air brakes" to be set in order to park the rig.    "Maxi cans" have a large spring that is held back with air while driving.  When they need to park the driver will normally pull a knob, which releases the air and the brakes engage.  The would be a "popping" rush of air sound you hear from these vehicles.|`|ee46a3813b089c742036795d5c9c56f5aa	The bus has what they call spring brakes. They operate off of air pressure. When the3 air is released from the spring brake canister the large springs push the rod that is connected to the slack adjuster, turning a "S" Cam that pusses rollers that are connected to the brake shoes and the brake shoes are pressed to the brake drums under tremendous force. The transmission does not need the park because if the brakes are properly adjusted the vehicle will not move if put in gear with the parking brakes applied. Some vehicles have a safety feature and the vehicle can not be put into gar unless the spring breaks are released.

ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa	You're going to get some spillage no matter what you do, but you really have to drain all the coolant out of the engine AND the radiator to keep from having a huge mess.  Most GM cars have a drain cock on the bottom of the radiator, but unfortunately, they usually get stuck and are made out of plastic, so there's a good chance you'll break it if you try to force it.  The easiest way to get the coolant out is to loosen the clamp on the hose that goes to the bottom of the radiator and pull the hose off.  You'll need a large pan to get all the coolant, and it is going to splatter, but it's really the most efficient way.  Good luck!|`|AA10242406	I agree with Michael G, I believe those vehicles drained by removing the lower radiator hose.|`|af071e75c571c6e729467aa66ccc1faaaa	You need to drain the radiator from the bottom using the petcock valve .... look hard enough and you'll find it.|`|ddf21ae8a9d059072e9b8c53baa4fd5baa	There should be a drain plug in your radiator which this will be located at the very bottom of it.  When you drain it make sure that you catch the fluid in some type of container.  Coolant is very poisonest to the environment as well as animals since it smells and tastes sweet to them.  It is a very sad thing to see this type of poisoning in an animal.  Causes convulsions, nerological damage, froathing at the mouth, and so on.  So please keep this in mind when doing this.|`|AA12108372	i dont think these newer cars have a petcock drain in the radiator i know mine dont its a 92 you just have to take off bottom radiator hose that should do for changing the thermostat.

All you need to do is find the fuse boxes.  get someone with some mechanical knowledge to find it for you if you can't then get that person to check the fuses to see if any fuses are blown which would probably cause your car to do absolutely nothing until it is replaced. Fuses are cheap $5-10 at most. If your car had no trouble starting prior to you leaving the lights on then that has to be your problem    don't return your battery, if it is a brand new battery then thats not the problem, the power from the battery can't reach the car if the power link has been broken hence the fuse.|`|cc1b57b40ccfd92e7f4c5eea33c827a4aa	HI   unfortunately your friend that boosted it backwards blew one or two of the main fuses in the fuse panel located in the engine compartment.If theses fuses blew quick enough all u need to do is replace them.they are there to protect the electrical system from damage.

Also wash out all your live wells. And rinse the inside of the boot out good as well.   And don't forget to grease your steering cable while at it.   Also don't ignore the trailer. Wash it good and repack the wheel bearings.   Something else you might want to do is wax the hull before putting it in the ocean and wax it again after getting it out.   You'd be surprised how much keeping the hull waxed helps the performance.|`|8Q18VbLXaa	It depends on how long you plan on having it in the ocean.

XLXncQu9aa	Well I have never been involved in a road rage incident.  I have seen it but never involved in it.  But to answer your question, I can remember a time once when I cut a bus off because I was rushing to get in another lane and I was impatient.  I wish I could have had more patience in that situation.  As far as road rage is concerned, I know for a fact that it is never a good idea to get behind the wheel of a car when you are upset or stressed out.  The reason is because you make hasty decisions.  Your speed is actually increased when you are upset about something, and you also don't pay attention to your surroundings like you should.  If you are having a bad day anything is liable to tick you off so to speak.  Just the slightest issue, whether it be waiting for a red light, another driver cutting you off, or even traffic jams.  Anything can cause you to become upset.  And yes, mood does affect your driving.  That is why it is not advised to take anti-depressants before driving.  In addition to causing drowsiness it can cause mood swings.  If you are unstable behind the wheel you make mistakes and your judgment is inhibited.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I did a bad thing over 30 years ago. I was riding my motorcycle and a chap pulled out into traffic right in front of me and fipped me the bird.  I passed him and when I got to his drivers door I gave it a good kick. Almost knocked myself off the bike doing it but it felt SOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD.   I later regreeted my stupidity and have never allowed myself to get upset by another driver since. But I still smile secretly to myself when I think of it.|`|79c8ae67c46c5115144cf09d72566a64aa	Yes to all, for an example one day I had my work truck F-350 super duty you can't miss it, this escort almost runs right into the side of me.  Having the truck I floored it and caught up with them you should have seen them start skipping lanes when I was closing in on them.  What made me so mad though was we were both doing 70mph if one of us would have hit the other we both would have wrecked and probably started a chain reaction accident, I'm not sure i think a kid was driving though just the way they reacted, put that 5.4 liter V8 Triton to good use now to me its funny just to see them that scared.|`|At3epWQwaa	well yeah im more reckless and i drive faster when im mad  but i still make good judgement...  like, i wouldn't run a red light or anything if there's traffic|`|W0b2oqZvaa	nope not really|`|o3Z0Xrjsaa	Yes to all the above. Some examples.    I had a Road Range incident early 2008. I had a driver tailing my so close that I could not see his headlights though the time was 4:10pm. Pissed off I changed lanes and let him pass and then got right up on his bumper at the stoplight, got out of my girlfriends car with a tactical baton(expandable) and expanded it. I walked up to the drivers rear passanger window, his drivers window was open and said What the **** are you doing dumb ***! Don't drive so close like that you ******** idiot. He tells me "Go back to your car" I told him some more choice words and walked back to the car; and when the light changed Green I flashed my lights and gave him the finger and turned onto a side street and on my way to pick her up from work as if nothing happened. I think the drivers behind me were totally stunned by what they saw. Guess I got lucky too; no one called the Police as I could have gotten in trouble for threatening him. But it felt go and I DO HOPE I SCARED THE CRAP out him, and maybe he will be less likely to tailgate someone again as the next person may not be as easy as I was. I will say I was about ready to break his rear drivers window but didn't. I should have just let him pass and leave at that. I try now not to let other drivers get to me but had another on News Eve 2008 that almost got the same treatment for taligating me to get to the 7-11. I just gave him the full hand salute and the bastard returned the favor. Lucky for him she was in the car and it was her car not mine; or I think it would have turned out like above, but with a broken window.    As for speeding I did 60mph in 35mph at 7:15am rush hour traffic because of an idiot tailgating me. I speed up and this moron speed up too. Don't know what his problem was but he finally passed me I gave him a full hand gesture. He just continued on his way. This was stupid on my part because of the time and traffic was meduim to heavy and I changed lanes like I was racing. Now I just do the posted speed and let the idiots pass and if I can I will just turn off and wait till all have gone by and get back on the road again. I will say I have pulled right back behind a tailgater and hope I scare them, as I will change right back on their bumper. Done this maybe 4-5 times in the last 3 years and try not to unless really pushed.  I have had mood driving and yes I have sped faster than traffic and gotten lucky no police were around. Try really hard now to not to let my mood dictate my driving and Chilled out ten fold from 2 years ago.|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	all the time, the worst is when theres a slow driver in front of you and you cant pass, man that reley makes me mad|`|9c9a473d5a6cb2d9eca28584f55aa068aa	I think all of those scenerios have happened to me at one point in time or another.

She was freaking out, running red lights, blowing stop signs. Well we were on the express way almost neck to neck when at last second she decides to get on the exit ramp. I slammed on my breaks got over 2 lanes and got on the exit ramp too, she freaked out and cut across the medium and got back onto the expressway.

FgRUdQOBaa	Well, all trains have some similarities, I have not ran MTA but I have run various trains for over 35 years.     There are three braking systems in a locomotive cab, two of them air brakes and an electric regeneration system.  On most passenger trains there is an integrated system called "blended braking" which uses the air and regeneration type systems simultaneously.     The basic drive on all modern trains is electric, most of them have huge deisel engines but all those do is operate a generator and the locomotive uses that electricity to move.   There are no gears or clutches, it is all automatic, advance the throttle and it applies more power to the wheels.     Steering is done by the interaction between the flanged wheel and the rail, we dont have to steer.   To go from one track to another there is a moveable portion of the rail that directs the movement to the desired route.

AkrMMcRIaa	Yo recin adquir un Mazda 3 s y te puedo decir que la calidad es similar a los Toyota o Honda, muy buen servicio, buenos acabados, etc.    Slo tengo una duda, mencionas que sera el motor 1.6 litros, segn tengo entendido slo se comercializan los de 2.0 y 2.3 litros, de 148 y 156hp respectivamente. De todos modos no son muy gastalones de gasolina y si son potentes, la verdad son autos muy confiables.    Por otro lado, mencionas que sera el automtico, a mi en lo personal me gustan ms los de transmisin estndar, pero tienes la ventaja que el automtico tiene transmisin tipo tiptronic en la que puedes manejar los cambios como si fueran estndar.    El equipamiento del auto es muy bueno y no le pide nada a otros autos del mismo nivel en tama?o y precio, por lo que es por todo esto una muy buena compra. 100% recomendable|`|UY2h4Ljtaa	sip el mazda es bueno pero a mi megustaria transmicion manual para mi esmejor tienes mejor respuesta al correrlo|`|rBmMVhgNaa	Acabo de adquirir un Mazda 3, de 2.0 litros a gasolina, VVT y transmisin manual.

Adems los servicios son muy econmicos.Yo los vi a todos con detalle y me decid por el Mazda 3.  En el caso de Mxico, Mazda no tiene mucho comercializando sus productos, pero te aseguro que es una marca japonesa muy confiable.

rBmMVhgNaa	Lo mas seguro es que sea una fuga en mangueras, bomba de agua o radiador. Para localizarla, despus de un recorrido con tu auto, estacionalo sobre una superficie uniforme e inspecciona por debajo del motor,seguro aparecer el origen de la fuga.  Si no detectas fuga alguna, usa mejor un anticongelante-refrigerante (dise?ado para trabajar  a altas temperaturas con una mnima evaporacin).  No es recomendable usar agua, a menos que sea una emergencia, si lo haces rutinariamente, tendrs problemas severos de corrosin a mediano plazo.  El peor de los escenarios (no te lo deseo) es que el lquido que pierde tu sistema de enfriamiento lo est recibiendo tu sistema motrz por falla en los empaques o sellos del monoblock. Revisa el nivel de aceite y checa tambin la consistencia y el color del lubricante. En caso de que lo notes diferente, no uses mas el auto y pide a un mecnico que lo revise. Si el motor no ha sufrido grandes calentamientos por la falta de liquido anticongelante , aun puedes salvar a tu motor.    Suerte!|`|e9kvoTw8aa	Pros: mas economico que el anticongelante, se puede encontrar en cualquier lugar, con rendimiento similar (no igual) hace la tarea de enfriar el motor.    Contras: Oxidacin de tuberias, menor punto de ebullicin que el anticongelante (por lo tanto se evapora ms fcil), corrosin de monoblock, solo se debe de usar en casos de emergencia.|`|1d4bf236d7a2cf40d821e26e9bcd5994aa	puedes tener una fuga o simplemente se evapora, existen unos anticongelantes que tambin son refrigerantes. el anticongelante trabaja a bajas temperaturas, si tu problema es el calor, un anticongelante con refrigerante es mejor opcin. Ahora bien,. si por algn motivo se vaca y el carro se calienta, es mejor llenarlo de agua si no tienes ms, pero debes drenarlo al rellenarlo segn las instrucci0ones del fabricante.      Suerte          paciencia y serenidad.|`|levWB5UYaa	Si se acaba rpidamente el anticongelante, seguramente tienes una fuga, ya que debe durar buen tiempo sin cambiarlo o rellenarlo, en cuanto a sustituirlo con agua, s se puede usar agua, pero no es muy recomendable ya que el anticongelante tiene elementos que evitan el oxido y los sedimentos que contiene normalmente el agua y se quedan pegados y tapan el radiador, aunque en tu caso mejor agua que nada, te recomiendo que vayas a reparar esa fuga, que puede ser desde una manguera floja hasta una fisura en el radiador, ya que si no lo haces puedes ocasionar un da?o al motor por recalentamiento....saludos!|`|1MrybIZuaa	No hay dudas que tu auto pierde el liquido refrigerante, por lo rapido que desaparece. Si tu auto es moderno no es aconsejable colocarle agua comun, en todo caso si te resulta oneroso comprar tanto refrigerante,  puedes colocarle agua destilada, esta al menos no ensucia tanto los conductos a no tener sales y retarda el exido.|`|RTYFbQYeaa	Si se acaba rapido el anticongelante debes tener fuga del radiador, o el tapon del radiador ya no tiene bueno el empaque y se derrama, o el deposito tiene fuga por la parte de abajo, o esta pasando al motor, checalo detenidamente ya que puedes averiar seriamente tu vehiculo y te costara muy cara la reparacion,por el calentamiento, si te llega a pasar no apagues el motor y ponle dentro y fuera del radiador agua abundante para controlar la temperatura y llevalo con un mecanico, yo te recomiendo el anticongelante porque e como dice el nombre en frio no se congela el liquido y prende mas rapido el vehiculo y en calor al llegar a tenperaturas extremas no se evapora y mantiene en temperatura al motor para evitar fallas, Saludos y suerte|`|CcxiUTxwaa	debes tener una fuga, conviene que la detectes a tiempo o te dejara  tirado.  en ese caso si puedes utilizar agua. pero agregale anticongelante.  aparte de ser anticongelante tiene la funcion de antioxidante y mantiene los metales y ligas en buen estado.

csmEH6qsaa	They are bow chocks, to feed the anchor line or dock line through. They are angled to coincide with the angle of your bow to reduce wear on your lines.    Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|4KvLIa6Saa	There used for securing it at the dock or anchoring. There should be 2 more on the stern also>|`|I7NkFJo2aa	I can see a cleat, two open topped fairleads, for mooring and tie up use, and a series of mounts on the deck to hold an anchor I feel, a round hollow  fitting either to take a chain down into a locker (it is set up in the right way for that), or to mount a pole or similar.  Then a rail and a bow light I assume.    edit    Must admit I've never heard a fairlead called a chock, so I have learnt something!   For the anchor to work it's going to have to have a few metres of chain, the tube going down into the chain locker would handle both I feel - otherwise I can't see where the chain could go.  That deck layout seems a bit awkward to me, but that's just my prejudice.  :)  The fairleads are mounted for looks more than practical functionality to avoid rubbing of the deck and lines IMHO|`|nAzbLdBCaa	I don't want to be repetitious, the "chocks" are to help the dock lines to change angles as they run from the dock or piling to the bow cleat.  They keep the line from rubbing the deck.  In this case they are not set-up to handle an anchor line.  Both because of the angles involved and size if the anchor rode.  The round anchor rode fitting, missing the top cover, is intended for rope only.  There is a larger one designed for rode and chain. I hope this helps.|`|VhhEz92Oaa	Chocks are nearly always right on the edge of the deck for the purpose of guiding the bow lines to the cleat.  Some vessels have the cleats built flush with the shear strake.  The line would be tied to the cleat, pass through the appropriate chock, and then to a cleat or bollard on the dock.    Here is a photo of a bow line passing through a chock with a protective sleeve on the line to prevent wear.  You can see the design of these chocks makes it difficult for the line to jump out and foul other components of the boat.    http://ubu.ca/tanzer22/fwdchocksonblocks...    Here is a shot of a large ship's bitts and chocks, the only one being used is obvious, thus illustrating that not all chocks are open on top:    http://www.sethwhite.org/images/vessels/...    The hawse pipe is similar to a closed chock, but only used for the hawser, or anchor rode (chain).    Looks like everyone got it right, with JTexas being first.|`|AA10621277	The chocks on the bow of a boat have one function. That is to guide the mooring lines through the chocks so that there will always be tension on the lines.|`|U24VtSlZaa	could you be more specific about the size and location of the "chocks"?    I use mine to keep the helicopter from rolling off the deck.....  ;)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`  those are to keep your dock lines straight and untangled.
AA10690406	The answer that last person gave was wrong... The clone engines are not made in Japan by Honda they are made in China by a number of different manufacturers but the parts do interchange. This is an issue Honda is not happy about. None of them are proven though and none of the manufacturers stand behind them. Basically once you buy one you are on your own with it and from what I've seen the quality is not comparible to the Japanese Honda. What I mean is you get what you pay for and that's it... Things like piston rings wear out fast and not only is the quality low but the assembly is just as bad and sometimes the manuals that come with them have wrong information, here is an example: one manufacturer states in the owner's manual that the spark plug used is a D8EA but it really uses a C7HSA and the D8EA won't work. You would probably be better off getting a used Honda than you would be getting a new Chinese clone. Unlike the clones the Honda is a proven model...|`|lM9NvSwnaa	I do not know of any Trail 50 clones being made.  i do know that some Chinese manufactors have bought Honda engines and remove the Honda badges from them then stick them in their small "mini bikes".

Yo tengo una 2007 con 25 mil kilmetros recorridos y 6 meses de uso. De modo que te puedo hablar de mi experiencia personal con este vehiculo hecho en EEUU.

Put some more on the surface at and around the leak.|`|EooU3QGnaa	That should be a sealed hull with a drain. Get some one to blow air into the hull while you run round it with a spray bottle-I use windex- and soak it in soap suds till the leak shows up and mark it with a wax pencil.

hktfe1UGaa	The Blue Angels fly F-18 A/B Models, The Thunderbirds fly F-16 C/D Block 32 Models. Those are different types of aircraft. The Eurofighter is a type of aircraft. It really depends on the pilots flying them and the maneuvers they perform. The Eurofighter might be more maneuverable because of the Thrust Vectoring Engines and the Canards, but that doesn't mean too much at all when you look at Flight Demo Teams.     It's the Pilots and what they do and what they perform, not really the aircraft as much. As time goes on Flight Demo teams change their aircraft.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	I think everyone is hitting just outside the bull's eye.  The REAL issue with a "better air show" is not the aircraft: all three you mention have excellent low airspeed maneuverability (a key element for displays), and outstanding instantaneous/sustained G onset rates (also important).  ANY qualified fighter pilot can do what display guys/gals do:  it's the intangible recruiting poster looks/personality that differentiate them from crews on the line.  I can tell you from personal experience (I flew with many bro's who either went to the Thunderchickens or had previously flown with them) that it's the regulations that the service's force them to fly under that make the difference.  This is nowhere more apparent in what the USN allows the Blue Angels to do and what the USAF allows the T-birds to execute.|`|GhUpEQWyaa	Doubt it, but I would love to witness a show with all of them to see!|`|0CkFC43raa	that depends on what you consider better. personally i think all airshow pilots are top notch. they all learn to fly their aircraft on the razors of control, as well as fly within inches of each other.    so to say that one demonstration team, or aircraft is better than another is hard to say.|`|ccece63d00054a95828823c47f261c6daa	It's not the aircraft that put on the shoe, it is the pilots.  .|`|XsZsk55Jaa	I think the expression Robert meant to quote was  "Its not the tools it's the carpenter".

rBmMVhgNaa	Si antes de cambiar la banda tu chevy arrancaba bien, entonces es muy probable que el problema sea con el  sensor de posicin. Este dispositivo (localizado a un costado de la rueda, justo abajo de la banda de tiempo) es un lector ptico que solamente permite el arranque del motor en una determinada posicin de la polea (rueda donde se monta la banda). Haz que lo revisen, debe estar limpio y sin da?os. Si el sensor est ntegro, entonces se deber reajustar la posicin de la polea con respecto al sensor, hasta que el chevy arranque. Cualquier mecnico o tu amigo puede hacerlo.   Espero te sirva mi comentario.|`|wt3JIrd7aa	eso depende, q hace cuando intentas arrancarlo? el motor trabaja o directamente cuando giras la llave no pasa nada? si es en ese caso el problema es el arrancador.    dame mas informacion    EDIT!!!    mira el problema debe ser el BURRO desarmalo y limpialo, lijandole los carbones y toda la bobina despues probalo tandole unos choques con la bateria. si todo anda bien lo volves a poner.    o sino purgalo|`|RhXdVowKaa	lo mas provable es que no coloco el tiempo como va ....y el censor no detecta la posicion correcta y no manda chispa para la bujia y asi pueda prender tu auto por eso escuchas la marcha pero no prende por que al estar fuera de tiempo no hay chispa...|`|VjbAxWpHaa	HEY!!  a mi me paso lo mismo no te preocupes mejor intenta prenderlo aventadolo, aveces a los chevys con el frio la marcha que tienen no les ayuda es tipico de los chevys y ya dale suerte nos vemos|`|w6oFJonNaa	Seguramente no pusistes las poleas en su sitio y esta fuera de tiempo, fijate en las poleas y tienen una marca cada una fijate que esten una enfrente de la otra cuando pongas la banda, eso hace que cuando una detecta el sensor la otra hace la chispa a la bujias. la marca de la polea de abajo tiene que estar hacia arriba y la marca de la polea de arriba tiene que estar hacia abajo .|`|HhOFDCkGaa	En Espa?a la llamamos la correa de distribucin, lo primero que tenais que haber hecho es calar el motor  mejor dicho, buscar todas las marcas que existen en cada polea, rbol de levas, cige?al y que coincidan las marcas.       Asegurar el volante del motor, para que no se os gire, de lo contrario, no se os pondr en marcha. Entonces tenis que poner las marcas en su lugar, para eso tenis que hacer lo siguiente.        Sacar la buja del primer cilindro ( depende el sentido de giro del motor, si gira a derechas  izquierdas), subir el pistn al P.M.S., y ponerlo en posicin de compresin, clavar el volante, buscar cuando hace el cruze de vlvulas del cilindro cuarto y entonces colocar la correa de distribucin, siempre las letras hacia tu barriga, para que las puedas leer bien.        Todo esto, contando con un motor de cuatro cilindros, dadle cuatro  cinco vueltas al motor, para comprobar si las marcas coinciden todas, de lo contrario, volver a empezar, hasta que quede todo en su punto.        Seguidamente, con mucho cuidado ponerlo en marcha, para comprobar el buen funcionamiento del motor, no forzarlo si escuchais ruido, parar el motor y volver a revisar las marcas. Que tengais suerte, de lo contrario, llevarlo al mecnico, que es lo sullo. Zapatero a tus zapatos.

e3vFckpUaa	No hay un coche especialmente dise?ado para topes. De hecho no hay un coche dise?ado para las calles y carreteras de Mxico. Busca que el coche tenga una altura minima de 15 cms entre el suelo y la base del chasis del auto.     Algunos coches altos son el Atos, la Grand Raid, la Kangoo, el CrossFox, la Ecosport, o la Tracker, aunque estos ltimos dos a veces los ponen en la categoria de SUVs.    Para reducir el riesgo de que tu coche pegue en el tope debes dejar de frenar una vez que las llantas delanteras hayan pasado el tope. Si ya no alcanzas a frenar antes de llegar al tope, ya no lo hagas, es menos doloroso para tu suspensin (la de tu coche y la tuya propia).

Un automtico nada mas lo conduces porque lo dems lo decide la transmisin automtica y tu tienes que esperar a que el auto quiera responder.  Para podre manejar un estndar es necesario tener pericia y tcnica|`|rBmMVhgNaa	Por varias razones...    1) Tu tienes el control y decides cuando y como hacer los cambios de velocidad.    2) Es menos complicado, frecuente y costoso el mantenimiento de una transmisin manual en comparacin con una automtica.    3) En general, el consumo de combustible es menor en una transmisin manual.    4) En caso de falla elctrica, el auto con transmisin manual puede conseguir arrancar con un empujn, no as el automtico.     5) La respuesta al arranque es retardada en un auto con transmisin atomtica. Con transmisin manual el arranque es inmediato.    La unica ventaja que yo le veo a la transmisin automtica es la comodidad en el manejo del auto, sobre todo en situaciones de mucho trfico...ideal para damas, quienes prefieren este tipo de autos.|`|ODCEwgxpaa	porque es mas comun y mas reconocido lo podes manejar mas fasil que un auto complicado con mas cosas    me ayudan a decidir http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|5KVB3LJiaa	Por que las transmisiones MANUALES no necesitan tanto mantenimiento, es mas divertido conducir un auto manual, acelear mejor, da mejor rendimiento de combustible...
MDNjiALBaa	ola preciosa soy ingeniero , te soy sincero en estos dias todos los autos que envian a mexico son autos de muy mala calidad y mas los de tecnologia americana ya que ni en estados unidos los quieren . en estados unidos se venden mas que ningun otro pais  los japoneses yo te recomendaria un honda o toyota o aleman como wv . son autos un poco caros pero lo importante es que sean buenos y te duren mucho, desgraciadamente te venden autos como chevy o el matiz que son autos que en estados unidos los sacaron porque se prendian en carretera y en este pais te los venden como novedad y nuestro gobierno como siempre ni le interesa que estas empresas lucren con la economia de nuestra gente , te mando un saludo y un besote cuidate .|`|LhScSHgBaa	Si tu pregunta se refiere a que si puedes contratar con la seguridad de que cumpliran lo que prometen, te recomiendo que confies solamente si la persona con la que realizas tu tramite trabaja en una agencia, y en esta sea donde te entregaran tu auto(y que lo puedas confirmar con algun gerente); te lo digo porque yo soy asesor profesional en ventas de autos nuevos, y mis inicios fueron en Planfia(chrysler), y en esta empresa, a algunas de las personas que contrataron conmigo no les cumplieron en las agencias en donde les correspondia recoger su auto. Por eso en la actualidad manejo SICREA (NISSAN) y es muy diferente porque si conmigo contratan, conmigo reciben su auto, y yo personalmente se los entrego.    CONCLUSION: Cuando necesites comprar auto, nuevo o seminuevo, acude a alguna agencia de la marca del auto que quieras; o en su defecto, a algun punto de venta que pertenezca a alguna de estas, de otra forma no puedes estar seguro/a realmente si existe formalidad con la persona que contratas.|`|0472d9e901c65516341b197408c5a89aaa	Seguramente te refieres al financiamiento "SuAuto"... es confiable, pero la verdad terminars pagando mucho ms que haberlo sacado a crdito normal, te recomiendo que mejor pidas un crdito bancario y cuando tengas la lana en la mano para el enganche te animes por tu cochecito nuevo.|`|172fc5d3c58423bda957acb4ed551a2daa	Mayormente lo son.

IzmUA7WHaa	El mazda no es japones, es de compa?ia estadounidense con lineas de oriente mas especificamente es de la Ford pero no propiamente solo esta en asociacin con otra compa?ia para hacer vehiculos de linea muy buena y economica, no se si lo has notado pero las ford escape son muy similares a las mazda tribute ya que casi possen las mismas piezas en el motor,,, en fin mazda en buena marca y hay algunos deportivos que son muy buenos    Perdona,,  Si tienes razon, para especificar mas e investigado mas con un amigo que ha tenido 2 mazdas un Miata y un Mazda 3 el me ha dicho que la Mazda es una compa?ia estadounidense (Ford) pero que solo se arma en Japon es decir como toyota que es japones pero se arma en Mxico y aqui en Estados Unidos y es por eso que es mas economico y tiene linea japonesa u oriental, al igual como la Ford a acaparado varias Marcas como Mazda,Volvo, Land Rover y Jaguar que estan asociadas con Ford y comparten algun tipo de linea en cuanto a partes son hechas por ford y armadas en otros lugares de Europa, Asia  y Latinoamerica.... Saludos|`|016fddafa9bf66678323f46ba331eb80aa	Mazda es barato por que no es tan japones, es una subcidiaria de Ford, a pesar de que no es tan buena como Honda o Toyota, siguen estndares de calidad mas altos que los dems autos Ford.

Por ejemplo, en mi caso, para un manejo "normal", los cambios los hago cuando la aguja del tacmetro anda entre las 3000 y 3500 rpm. Para un manejo mas deportivo o durante un rebase, puedes hacer los cambios hasta las 5000 , 5500 o inclusive 6000 revoluciones por minuto (rpm), todo depende de los lmites de seguridad que te marque tu tacmetro (la escala del instrumento en los niveles de advertencia se indica en color rojo ).  Considera que entre mas revoluciones le apliques al motor de tu vehiculo, el consumo de gasolina se ir a las nubes.  Por otra parte, en cuanto a los cambios hacia una velocidad inferior, debido a pendientes o frenadas, estos podras hacerlos cuando la aguja del tacmetro ande rondando las 2000 rpm.  Al principio quizs tengas la necesidad de ver de reojo el tacmetro para tomar la decisin de hacer un cambio de velocidad, pero poco a poco conocers mejor tu auto y luego lo hars de manera intuitiva.  Felicidades por tu nuevo auto y disfrtalo !|`|Q3FNkWLQaa	Hemano, la velocidad a la cual debes cambiar la palanca, es variable dependiendo de el modelo.    Lo que debes tomar en cuenta son las rpm (revoluciones por minuto).    Es bueno hacer el cambio de velocidad cuando el motor vaya aproximadamente a las 3,000 rpm.    De todas maneras, no quiero dejar de comentarte que mientras ms le exijas a tu carro, ms pronto te lo acabars, es decir, mientras ms lo cuides, ms alargars su vida til.    Suerte.|`|WBeGMQKYaa	Eso depende, si vas de paseo, puedes hacerlo cuando quieras, asegurandote que el motor no valla planchado y esforzandose en bajas revoluciones vibrando y a los tirones, eso es lo mas da?ino.  Pero si quieres ganarle al que va al lado (lo cual es ilegal), debes acelerar con tres cuartos de pedal hasta que sientas que el motor empuja con total libertad, con vigor, llendo como violin, ah pisas al fondo y te hundes en la butaca hasta que la aguja del tacmetro est cerca de la zona roja, ah tienes que hacer el cambio y repetir todo nuevamente.  Pero haslo solo en tramos cortos, 100 o150 metros, suficientes como para ganar o perder, si le sigues dando, el auto se embalar e iras a mas de 130 en plena avenida y terminar tu auto enroscado a un arbol y t muerto o preso.

De la central de autobuses debes tomar el metro (linea 5 -amarilla) en direccin estacin Politcnico y bajarte en la estacin Instituto del Petroleo y ahi mero transbordar a la linea 6-roja que te llevar hasta la estacin Rosario, donde debes transbordar una vez mas a la lnea 7-naranja para bajarte en la estacin Auditorio. Salir del subterrneo a la Avenida Reforma y tomar un autobus o  microbus en direccin al centro de la ciudad, que te llevar por todo Reforma hasta la glorieta del Angel de la Independencia.

gpMAkzKSaa	Make sure you have the clutch fully engaged before shifting into first. then crack the throttle open to increase RP M's while simultaneously releasing the clutch. if you simply shift into first without doing this the bike will stall and the engine will shut down.|`|QowE44aAaa	Take it out of gear before you attempt to start it.  Even a beginner ought to know that much. And I assume that since you regularly kill the engine, that you are a new rider.  The transmission gears are "Synchronized", so that they mesh properly, and for that to work the transmission has to be able to turn.  So when you killed the engine, you killed the "syncro" effect.

6e36b9837420adb6b906ae01a1e722d4aa	Yes,,the -7's will work fine in place of  -8's.    The heat range of a plug  is strictly a matter of how fast it SHEDS heat.    Plugs don't Generate Heat.    NGK happens to be Originator of "wide range" heat-range plugs.  The plug numbers actually overlap at the end of their designed ranges.    Except on very,very sharply tuned engines---which No Production "street" engine ever  is---  You can almost invariably go UP or Down 1 heat number with NGK Plugs.    The only threat of using a distinctly  "Too Hot " plug comes at Peak Power point,,,,where engine is producing it's highest combustion pressures,,,and temperature.    For you to use -7 rather than -8 during cooler weather,,,could even be argued validly to be a "good thing".    And with your engine being water cooled,,with modest compression,,it's even MORE accomodating of a single heat number  deviation from standard plug.    Put a dab of oil on the threads,,,use a torque wrench if you've got one.  Those are Excellent plugs.  Lots of bikes even show improvements in their various start/run mannerisms.|`|QomVD1ceaa	If they are new and you have the box just return them. Get the right plugs. You can do damage to the engine.
skfHV92caa	If the check engine light is coming on for the same problem.  The only things left are an ignition coil problem, a fuel injector, or low compression problem in that cylinder.  Not common that it has a compression problem with that mileage but not unlikely.  Coils usually go bad first on those.  Check those things first.  I've also seen a leaking intake that causes a misfire problem on those cars.  Good luck.|`|I8f9AAEIaa	Fairly common prob. Bad valve springs.  They will need to be replaced. ~Dan|`|b8451488aa5582f5076b61d1a2afd6d2aa	I DONT  KNOW BUT I SURE LIKE FOR WITH HOT MARINE|`|AA12261615	your still showing to have a miss fire on no 4 cylinder,its not common for one to do that unless there's a problem with a wire or a plug or a possible loss of compression,with that low of miles on it its very unlikely you have a head gasket problem id be checking for a bad coil,they will cause one to have a miss fire even after replacing the wires and plugs in them,good luck.

From what I've seen a stock 300zx tt will run a 1/4 mile time of about 14.1 seconds.  A stock 240sx will run about a 16.5 1/4 mile time.  There are a lot of 240sx with SR20 swap these days though.  A basic SR swap will usually put the 240 into a stock 300zx territory.  With a few modifications though, a SR swapped 240 will easily outperform a stock 300zx in every category.
6e36b9837420adb6b906ae01a1e722d4aa	They're 'sposed to be torqued in a criss cross pattern,,one time around to  10 ft lbs.    Then a 2nd time around to 15~17ft lbs    15~17ft lbs is a bit "light" for 5/16"  size  hardware.    Reason why is because they get a littleTighter when engine warms up,,from the expansion of the aluminum cases.    This sounds a bit scary,,,but some "loosening" is due to the studs actually Stretching over time.  30 Years is a long time to be holding a grip,,,especially with the cases "Swell & Shrink" with each  time motor is started & run,,then shut down and cooled.    It's POSSIBLE they might could stand to be replaced.    If they dont Feel Right as you get around 15ftlb,,they may be fatigued.  "Feel Right" is hard to describe---it should be convincingly Solid & firm feeling,,,,,not any sort of "cheesy/soggy feel".    The Nuts should almost quit turning much at all as You approach 15ft lbs  or so.    It's even Tuffer to sense,,because Torque Specs are Under typical specs for that size.    Not to worry,just so You'll know.    Hope that helps,,,and dries it up for ya.

U24VtSlZaa	Even an 80lb trolling motor will not move you very fast.    up to 45lb -55lb usually are 12Volt motors, beyond that are 24V, which require two batteries.  Use the biggest, heaviest marine deepcycle batteries you can afford.    Think about getting a trolling motor as an alternate means of propulsion.|`|OdxrtbF1aa	Even a modest head wind or a few weeds on the prop will leave you unable to move with the trolling motor alone.  My advice is put the 6 hp outboard on too, and run the electric along side so you can choose which to use depending on conditions.    Center the outboard on the transom because it has more power and place the electric off to one side or mount it on the bow if it has the right hardware for that.  Enjoy.
d9ECb7N8aa	The cd player mounts where the factory cassette unit is (in the middle of the dash near the cup holder). The other part of the radio where the digital display, volume controls, ect, are located is no longer used. You can get a little 'bucket' to put in place of it so that you have a little cubby hole or you can just leave it there.    There are mounting kits available for a normal 'DIN' sized radio, but the unit will stick out a couple inches farther that the cassette unit location.    You will need to purchase a mounting kit (found at any car audio store), Walmart may still carry them.

Myself run a Spec GTS-T Type M and when i looked at buying the car it was stock apart from a bodykit and we ran a  0-60 in 5.2 secs which is below book value.

U24VtSlZaa	if you have a sealed battery you can't check the fluids.    Otherwise, pop the caps off, there will be three holes under each cap (total of six cells at 2 volts each = 12 volts).    Inside they have a solution of sulphuric acid and water.  Water evaporates, so has to be replaced every now and again.    Be very careful, that acid burns if it gets on you, and it'll eat right through blue jeans (don't ask me how I know).    Use only distilled water -- drinking water has minerals that interfere with the recharging process.  Add enough to cover the plates.  If the water level is too low, you'll be able to see the plates.    The primary cause of premature battery death is storage at less than full charge.  You should always recharge the battery soon as you get home, and top it off every 3-4 weeks if you don't use it.  Better yet, keep it on a "smart-charger" with "float" mode or "maintain" mode.  Not a "trickle-charger".|`|csmEH6qsaa	Does your battery have removable caps? If so you need to pop them open and look inside at the cells.  The fluid level should be covering the plates inside the battery. If not you should add some distilled water - enough to cover the plates.  You battery may also look like new but if it is over 3 years old I would replace it.  You may want to buy a new battery if you are not sure about the battery age, sure beats paddling home.     Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|AA12095978	you don't change the electrolyte, ever.  you can add distilled water and when the battery gets a charge it will convert it into electrolyte.  Not all batteries will allow you to do this, as they are sealed.    if a battery sits for long periods of time not being used, they will begin to grow sulfation on the battery cells.  it's like plaque on your teeth.  Except with sulfation, you can't clean the cells.  you can TRY to charge it with a high amp charger for 10 minutes, sometimes, it breaks the sulfation, most of the time, you just get to buy a new battery.    to keep a battery alive you need a battery maintainer for when the battery isn't being used.|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	There is very good information available on batteries in the source link below.

Good luck|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	there is a cover on the top of most battery's take a screw driver and pry the little piece off and look into each hole and see that the lead plates are covered. if not you could add some distilled to cover the plates.   Not all battery's are serviceable. also you can have a load test put on the battery and that will tell you if the battery is any good. even if it looks new ,it could be a dud|`|lgjIwUftaa	you do not change the ( acid ) in a battery to my knowledge. You can purchase battery acid @ a car parts store or use distilled water. I have always used tap water without any issues. You should add your water to cover the coils in the battery, do not fill to top of battery.  You do this by removing the cover(s) on top of battery with screwdriver. Be very careful not to get any of the acid on you or your cloths. It will hurt and burn holes in your skin and cloths. I think it best if you take it to an auto/battery shop and have it tested. But it sounds as if the battery is old and worn out. Check for a purchase date on battery. I hope this helps. Good luck
WO68RZdIaa	I'm not sure if GA is mandatory suspension/revocation for Reckless Driving or not. But yes, there is the chance that he could lose his license. That will be up to the judge or possibly DMV.    And he should have been thinking about how he would go back and forth to school before he decided to ignore the laws & drive in an unsafe manner.      Driving is only a privilege, not a right. There is no laws in any state that gives anyone a right to drive. A state is under no obligation to give one single person living within that state a driver's license. So now he is finding out what happens when you abuse that privilege.     Get an attorney & see if the attorney can get the charges reduced to save his license. But if this is your son, maybe it's about time he learns to be an adult & a suspended license will be a good wake up call that the laws pertain to everyone & he is not above the law as he seems to think that he is.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	He needs to drive slower|`|JSFCkne8aa	You should probably get an attorney.  He should be able to  get the charges lowered to just a simple speeding charge.  Or maybe even dropped if he attends a driving class.|`|RKw56KZaaa	He needs to lose his license and learn his lesson.    My brother in law got arrested for reckless driving at the same age, got the lawyer kept his license. His insurance went to $5,000/yr a few months later back at it again, this time over 100mph, lost control, got hit by an oncoming car in the door and died.    He needs to calm the hell down, riding a bike and thumbing for rides will help him with this, trust me.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	In most places, that is indictable.  In Canada, that much over the limit is Criminal Code, on the same level as drunk driving.  He is a lousy driver and you should hope he is suspended at the very least.    And why did YOU pay his fine the first time?  What did he learrn from that experience?  Silly question, obviously he learned nothing.  Hardship licence is only granted (and not in every state or province) to a sole family income generator, or sometimes a student, if there is absolutely no other way, such as that new invention, the transit bus, to go.  But, for school, that means classes, not extra-curricular activities.  Considering how much over the limit he was going, and the fact he is only 18 and now has been caught twice, you seem to be treating this as if it is going to be more an inconvenience than a sign of irresponsibility and immaturity, both extremely dangerous to everybody else on the road, not just him.  He is not ready to be a driver.  When the insurance bill comes in, maybe that will trigger more of a reaction.|`|AA11914369	Well, at over 30 over the the limit, I would hope so, especially with a prior.    Georgia Drivers License Point system  Violations of Georgia driving law will result in points being assessed to your driving record as shown below:   Violation / Points     Reckless Driving - 4 points  Unlawful passing school bus - 6 points   Improper passing on hill or curve - 4 points   Speeding:   15 mph but less than 19 mph - 2 points  19 mph but less than 24 mph - 3 points   24 mph but less than 34 mph - 4 points   34 mph or more - 6 points  Disobedience of any traffic-control device or traffic officer - 3 points   Possessing an open container of an alcoholic beverage while driving - 2 points     So, at the least a 4 point ticket and, Under 21 Years of Age Suspension  The Georgia driver's license of any person under 21 years of age convicted of any of the following offenses shall be SUSPENDED:     *Exceeding the speed limit by 24 miles per hour or more.     So yes, the license will be taken.  See http://www.speedingticketcentral.com/Geo...    Note that reckless driving is another 4 points.    Too bad he didn't learn the first time, but maybe not having a license and paying a large fine will get his attention.|`|kIy2bdiraa	I know that in Michigan you can lose your license for reckless driving and such.  Here we have suspended too.  Sometimes you will lose your license for a while, then get a suspended license after that.  The suspended one lets you drive only between certain hours, and I don't think that you can have anyone in the car.

X8V4VCsxaa	The insurance companies decide who is at fault.  However, you must file a police report especially if the other driver did so.  Your company will want a copy.  The accident is probably chargeable to you but should not effect your rates.  You should call your agent and discuss this.  You also can file an accident report but not seek coverage by your company.  Decide depending on your deductible.  Finally, If you have collision coverage, your company will pay for your damage but if you don't then you have to get money from the other drivers insurance company and to do that, you have to prove fault.  Hope it helps|`|U9bgWBWZaa	File a police report. Since there were no witnesses then it will probably be "no fault" in which you pay for your damage and the other driver pays their damage.|`|AA11914369	Nothing wrong with a police report no matter how minor the accident is.    You both merged without being sure the way was clear to do so, so it will probably be both your faults, and each of you pay for your own damage.  But turn it in to your insurance and let them figure it out.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Read the police report.|`|faa35ec1fb8fad57ed3c419553576dcdaa	Report it to your insurance. It doesnt have any negative effect on your rates unless your insurance company has to pay... This is one of those he said she said cases... Just tell them it's not your fault. The other person will tell their insurance company that is not his fault.     The two insurance companies will get together and decide that fault is 50/50. So this will give you a partial increase in premium.. It wont be that bad.    If you dont get your insurance involved, the other insurance company could find you 100% at fault.     Use your insurance company for what it's for: they will represent your best interests.

Q2wdm3spaa	Eric summed it up pretty well, it sounds like a trickle charger or battery tender is your best bet. Most come with a disconnect in the cable and a harness to fasten onto your battery terminals. That way you just pull out a cable to connect it, instead of having to open everything up to get at the battery. I put on on every bike I own. It's 30 to 40 bucks well spent.|`|AA12095978	a trickle charger is perfect for you.  get an automatic charger OR maintainer.  low amperage, 1-2.5amps only.  when the battery gets low, the charger will juice the battery, when it's full, it simply goes into "float" mode and maintains the voltage.  BEST way to  keep a battery alive for a long time.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	trickle charge is what most battery charger are but the ones that wil crank a car like one you might see at shop most of onme you see at like walmart will charge battery over nite ones made just for motorcycles can stay on a month or so and it wil kick on every once in a while i use one for car and charge over nite either way wil work an di think mine was about 30 bucks at walmart|`|qsozRiDGaa	If you can, get a gel battery for your motorcycle. A gel battery is like an automotive battery, maintenance free. I would still get a battery stabilizer.  Try to google "smart tender".  This smart tender is a great product and I have used it for the past 20 years.  It keeps your battery charged and it will not over charge the battery.  Its better than a trickle charger.  People with classic cars and all years of motorcycles use the smart tender by Deltran. You can purchase this battery stabilizer for about $40 online.  Best of luck.

I have a 1989 535i & she is running basically like new at over 150,000.     Now, when something does go wrong (generally its electrical)  BMW charges about 300-400 more than other car makers.     BMW's are safe & very fun to drive .... I am a college student and I work part time for fun money & to my parents for insurance and maintenance.     I would rather pay a couple hundred dollars a month for maintenance savings than pay that for a cheap car that isn't fun to drive.     It all depends if your family can afford it ... or if your son can handel college and working to pay for it.    Very fun car & its neat to have them when you're young|`|5mIhU9KAaa	i would not get it. first off it's 10 years old. Bmw's have a higher chance of having problems with age, especially one that is 9 years old. 110,000 miles is a lot for any car and for a bmw makes your car even more likely to have problems. it is imposible to predict the future of a car breaking down. but based on history it would not be wise to get that car. you need to buy your son a reliable car for college even if it is not a cool bmw. i recomend something japanese like maybe a scion or a toyota corolla or honda civic/accord they are all really popular with college students. you can risk it with the Bmw but it's not a risk i would be willing to take for it could cost you thousands to fix in the near future.    hope i helped and good luck|`|l737MASAaa	8 grand for that is too much  im not sure where you live but i live in atlanta and on my craigslist i see 2000 BMW 323i and 2000 328i all the time for around 6. and they have less miles than that.

All the hype about constant break downs is overplayed, the vast majority of BMW owners never have any problems with their cars and only really require typical maintenance, like oil and a filter.  They are very well engineered, and it shows. $8,000 seems a bit high, though - I would try to barter it down.  The 323i isn't particularly powerful or fast, so I don't think that would be a big problem.  110,000 miles is nothing - we have a 1980 BMW with over 300,000 miles on it, and it runs like new.  If it has been properly maintained, it won't be a headache at all.

And finally getting your car retuned with all the aftermarket parts and your car will be faster and have more of a kick. as far as the parts i dont know who makes them and where to get them but i found a website which is http://www.camryforums.com/forum/ and im sure they can answer where to get these parts|`|SNkDwJvEaa	I honestly don't no.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Custom exhausts will improve hp and mpg, but they cost several hundred dollars.   Reprogramming your car's computer will also improve performance, since it will allow for higher rpms, at which there will be more power. It will do that by changing the way that the transmission shifts and increasing the rev limitations on the engine.   If you were to do both of these, it would be about a grand. It would make your engine feel like its a completely different animal, giving you much wider torque band and a good 30hp.   For about a hundred bucks you can add maybe 3hp by getting a custom intake. You wont probably notice a difference unless you combine it with other upgrades.

If its getting as regular as yours then the only cure is a rebuild with new seals and fluid. They are also prone to hydraulic lock when the caliper slider boots gets water in them, This water gets trapped between the boot and slider pin and causes the lock.

In 30+ years of riding Japanese bikes with disc brakes, I've never heard of that one.  The only discs that ever actually rusted were the cast iron discs used on Moto Guzzis many years ago.  Japanese discs have a fair amount of stainless steel in them to keep them from rusting.  The only time I've ever had any rust form on amy of my bikes was when tom cats peed on them.  Now that will make little rust spots.    It makes me wonder if a previous owner swapped discs since cast iron does stop better than stainless mixes.  Or, I'd wonder what kind of brake pads you have but even metallic pads use non-ferrous metals and don't rust.    Which brings me to the next question, what kind of shape are your pads in?  If they're completely worn out, then you will have steel against the discs and that will rust.  But rusting isn't the big problem there, it's the steel eating the discs up and ruining them.      Oh, what ever you do, don't spray WD 40 on the discs because that will render them useless and get you into an accident.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Without seeing exactly what you are talking about I can only speculate, but sounds like it is time to rebuild the calipers and flush the system while you are at it.

The actual rotors would get rust on them starting in a day or two of non riding.|`|cUiUNunYaa	There's a 'rubber' seal that surrounds the brake calliper piston (not the dust cover).It has two jobs,first to hold in the hydraulic fluid and second it acts like a return spring,it's deformed when the piston moves out and the 'spring' retracts it back into the calliper,this lets the pads relax,as it were,age and various contaminants can make this action weak or non existent. A calliper strip and clean and rebuild with new seals and fluid will probably cure this.Also check the pads,some are manufactured with metal particles embedded it the material,this wont help..|`|26c154b69baa8aa4faf85a634112c1aeaa	if its been wet out every day i get rust on my discs ( honda blackbird )  never to the point of sticking the pads to the discs but it does happen    my fireblade did suffer from that but again only if its been wet like you said after 1 use of the brakes its gone|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	couple of things...the pads must be lubed with copper slip on the points where they touch the calliper sides,NOT on the breaking surface..the pistons may also need pushed out,cleaned and replaced..|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    You do not say if on both sides of the disc?  I do not know the bike but does it have floating callipers?  If yours  look like  http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/NOS-Honda...  IMSfp=TL0901261510009r16066  Then you have floating callipers, Instead of each side pushing out the pistons the whole unit only has pistons on one side and the whole calliper moves on pins.  If this is cause remove whole unit and clean and grease the pins and check pads at the same time as one will be worn than the other.    Andy C|`|CCqqTw6paa	may be due to the rust  try lubricating it with wd40/rp7   it alsohelps in the prevention of rust    hope that helps|`|dAjYPMg2aa	You may have ridden on roads with salt residue, it kills brakes, rinse it down with a hose before putting to bed, however if constantly used in those conditions it may be time for an overhaul by a mechanic|`|AA11037149	janice h got it
S8Qpiabdaa	MY HUSBAND HAS A 99" F150 ON HIS CHRISTMAS BONUS HE BOUGHT A SET OF 26" GAZARIO 702 BALLERS AND THEY FIT PERFECTLY FINE. SEND ME AN E MAIL AND MAYBE WE CAN TRADE PICTURES.

AA12261615	if you could find a wrecked one with all the needed parts it would cost you around 5-6 grand at the least to change it over,i have did one before and the cost was more than it was worth,and we bought a whole truck just to get all the parts we needed,its a lot of work to change one over,good luck.|`|d1dd02060cdb51c9ddd303817ecbf6eaaa	You can find low mileage  drop in engines and transmissions for between  2,500 and 4,000 bucks. They come with the computer and complete wiring harness. Car or truck don't matter so long as you have the right computer, the engine and trans mounts are the same. And you'll need a V8 cooling fan shroud. Be sure to buy a shop service manuel for your truck at the Dodge place. It will save you wiring grief .|`|ADogjIjZaa	buying an engine and all the wiring/necessities that come with it and getting it put into the V6 ram will cost a lot (depending on where you get the engine from, labor, etc) so you're better off selling the V6 Ram and buying a V8 Ram outright.... it'll save you time and money in the long-run.
kIy2bdiraa	The abs light is coming on because it's getting a fault in the system.  Usually this fault is from a bad sensor.  When the ABS light is on, the will be the same, it just won't have any ABS.  Every time that you turn the car off, it resets the computer and the light will go back on until the sensor ( or whatever caused there fault) fails again.    Honestly I don't think that this guy did anything that would have caused the ABS to stop working on your truck, but if you are in doubt, take it in and have it fixed.  When it's getting fixed, figure out what is wrong and ask if it could have been caused by the heater core replacement.    Oh, BTW the computer that this guy was using was most likely and engine computer, and wouldn't show any ABS codes anyways, since that is a separate system.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you might have a loose wire going to 1 of the sensors or it,s corroded.|`|AA12095978	I'll say the FIRST time he saw a code and cleared it.  the 2nd time he couldn't getaway with it.    I'll say that they didn't really touch the ABS sensors. they might have popped a fuse by accident maybe? you really need to get that code though so you know what it is and work from there.    I do believe in coincidences, and this very well could be one.
AA12095978	the stuff at the autostore..     this time, use Lexol, brown bottle.    3 shoe repair shops I know ONLY use Lexol, and you know they deal with leather shoes all day, same concept.|`|4WkfePR8aa	Recover the seats.  You can get covers (not the cheap slip-on type, the kind you have to hog ring in place).
