Many states will have extra lending programs over and above the FHA incentives, including down payment assistance or a discount off of the rate.  <br>  <br>  Best advice I can give is to go to a Bank, NOT a mortgage brokerage, and tell them your situation.  If your income or credit don't qualify for a loan, ask them to refer you to a broker they trust.  <br>  <br>  Going to a mortgage broker first can cause you to get killed in fees that will get added to the loan.  <br>  <br>  Balloon Mortgage- Offers very low rates for an Initial period of time (usually 5, 7, or 10 years); when time has elapsed, the balance is due or refinanced (though not automatically).  This is very dangerous, especially with rising interest rates like we have right now.  If your credit goes bad and you can't qualify to refinance your loan, you will be forced to sell your home quickly to avoid default.
d3626b45b25d5c4c740a383f4a304233aa	It is very evident most of the people who answer you question has never lived through the real estate down turn of in late 70's and early 80's. That down turn triggered one of the largest saving and loan failure since the depression. The government had to create the RTC (an organization to absorb all the properties held by failed banks and S&Ls). While everyone today is taking about flipping and zero money down, the market is already in the middle of a correction. In Florida, the inventory is 3 to 4 times today than last year. Four months ago, one of the largest bank in the country corporate lending division contacted us soliciting our commercial business. They told us they are very concerned about the residential market and need to diversify. This is from the people in the know.<br>  <br>  Yes lots of people lost money and it is dangerous when we see all these seminars on how to get rich quick in real estate.

13f0100d5cbe5c18c5ea7995af92c1f1aa	Try applying to companies that have not begun to post jobs listings that you're looking for on their websites or other centralized resume databases. When a company resorts to this, it's usually after other options have been exhausted such as these in some similar order:<br>  <br>  1. They are not actively looking for someone to fill a job, but could use someone.<br>  2. They couldn't find anyone inside their company to do the job.<br>  3. They couldn't find referals to do the job.<br>  4. Local advertising wasn't doing the trick.<br>  <br>  The idea is that you'll have a better chance getting your foot in the door during earlier stages of the recruitment process, rather than trying to get in when everyone is doing the same.<br>  <br>  When you're sending your cover letters and resumes, have a good idea of what you want to do and how you would fit into the organization.

It sounds to me like the business will be very small, probably just you, or maybe yourself a few friends. Given this, I would think that incorporating at this point is not necessary. You can open a business checking account at a local bank and do what's called a DBA (doing business as) this will allow your clients to pay a COMPANY rather than a PERSON. This will give you some credibility and it's an easy process. You shouldn't need any licenses, etc. If your business grows to the point where incorporating would provide you with significant advantages, make sure that you understand ALL of the corporate options: C Corp, S corp, LLC etc. They all have strengths and weaknesses, so finding out which one makes sense for you will probably require an accountant.|`|ce5f3be0c91df283b3675363ef53c050aa	No, however to take advantage of the tax breaks that come along with owning your own business....I would advise doing so.

c0c559c492ed0f1936eb441c4dd1d38faa	individuals trading foreign currencies is DANGEROUS.. Why? because many forex brokerages leverage your portfoio (i.e. you are allowed to trade $10,000 in currency for a $1000 deposit)  The problem is, if your currency drops 10% in price (using the above leverage ratio), your account is frozen, and your entire investment is GONE.<br>  <br>  And even larger problem is what are known as "Spreads".  This is the difference in price between the highest bidding price when you buy the currency, and the lowest asking price when you sell the currency.  The difference is how the currency specialist (or your broker) makes a little bit of money on each transaction.<br>  <br>  Always look at the spreads.. If they are more than a few pips, your broker is ripping you off.<br>  <br>  Do not consider investing in forex without reading several books on it.<br>  <br>  Try your local library. Don't believe all the hype from the forex brokerages.|`|OqCIl735aa	Man don't let these guys scare you. Yes there is a spread but depending on your portfolio amount and what your margin is set at, you will usually make it up within a few minutes. Besides you only pay the spreads when you open new trades. I will usually ride my trade line for at least a week before I re-allocate my portfolio. <br>  Yes you can leverage your portfolio, and I would never trade without doing so. I am always leveraged at 400:1. It is just smart. Leveraged money only applies to the interest you earn not to the amount you are actually putting into the trade. So you invest $10k at ten percent you are actually risking 1k in trade and leveraging 400k in interest. <br>  I agree, you need to research and learn, and information is great, however there is a thing called applied knowledge that by far out weighs information. Get yourself plugged into a system that is proven. I stumbled upon FreedomRocks a while back and have never left. I gained a ton of applied knowledge there and now do all my trading there.

If you are consistently over drawing your account eventually the bank will hold your deposits to make sure your overdraft is paid and to not allow you access to funds in case of any pending transactions you may have.  They don't give straight answers because it's embarrassing to tell someone they don't know how to manage their money.  The bank needs you to be consistent.  Don't overdraw your account for between 3 and 6 months and your bank won't hold your deposists.  BY THE WAY, the teller doesnt ever make the decision.  It is computer generated and the only one who can over ride this is the branch manager who can elect to deposit part of your check or keep it on hold.  If you want more specific answers go to your branch and ask for the manager and tell him/her what your problem with deposit holds is and let him/her explain to you why this is happening to you and what you can do so it won't happen anymore.

AA11474433	Foreclosure on a home or condo? <br>  <br>  If it is a home that might have been out of your financial range and it got you into debt from a loan, or anything going on with it I think maybe you should find a cheap condo or I guess rent. Get your finances straightened out completely and get onto the road of better finance.<br>  <br>  If it was a foreclosure on a condo from your mortgage payments or whatever it was, then definitely get a small apartment and like I previously said straighten out all of your finances. Don't look for homes or adjustable rate mortgages or the crazy sub-prime loans that look fantastic online. Always get a fixed rate loan so that the company can never start changing what you owe!!! Do a lot of financial researching on loans, interest rates, and your credit score. Never ever get a loan from a sub-prime because you will be drowning in debt and will NEVER be able to pay it off because majority of the time all your paying them is interest, and by the time your done for all you know you might be throwing an extra $100,000 to that company only for interest when you do the math correctly.<br>  <br>  Each person is entitled to one free credit score statement each year by either transunion, equifax, or experian. Those are the 3 credit bureaus in the U.S. look at your credit score and look at what might be best for you. The higher your score, the better. If your score is going down into about the 600's or god forbid even lower, then forget about getting any loans because your interest rate could be 10% or higher. Just forget about loans for now or anytime soon and just get something to rent and definitely do some financial planning for your future.|`|683e800cf88da167f8d544e108e37145aa	yes you should start looking for a place to rent<br>  but if you can't find a place in time---you can stay at an extended stay hotel [they have kitchens] where you pay by the week or month<br>  good luck|`|51ef253b096409747bd63fd4a368d1a9aa	first of all, if you own your home, why can't you rent it to someone for a little more than your mortage payment and live in a trailer or something until you get back on your feet.

uRhO7r8kaa	For all time, in our culture, it seems, obtaining a sound understanding of financial principles has been beyond the grasp of many.  Indeed, it has seemed that the bankers, the insurance agents and the financial services people are the smart ones, and the rest of us are not, and we have to rely on them, because "Money," we all know, "is too complicated for the rest of us to learn!"<br>  <br>  And that is what the big boys, traditionally, like us to believe, it seems!<br>  <br>  So, along come entrepreneurs who offer to sell us "secrets" of building wealth!  And those "secrets" are divulged in a collection of CDs that range in price from $1,500 to nearly $21,000.<br>  <br>  Let's take a step back and do some market analysis, for that is a prudent thing to do, before starting any for-profit business (even not-for-profit organizations, for that matter, do not intend to lose money!).<br>  <br>  First of all, I ask, "If a person does not have much money saved up, because he does not understand wealth-building principles, or he does not have a habit of saving money, can he afford to pay $1,500 to $21,000 to learn a different way?<br>  <br>  Second, I ask, "If a person does have lots of money saved up, because he understands wealth-building principles, and he has good savings habits, why would such a person spend $1,500 to $21,000 for what he already knows and does?"<br>  <br>  Now, taking things a step further, why would anyone spend, even $150 a year, to have the right to sell something that, as rationalized above, has little market demand, i.e. has little chance of selling?<br>  <br>  And, what if, after six months of no selling, that distributor of CDs  becomes "inactive," and the company terminates him?<br>  <br>  Oh!  But what if someone does have $1,500 to $21,000 laying around, perhaps from a recent inheritance, or lottery winnings?  Maybe that person has a habit of spending money and wants to spend his money on a wealth-building program!  But what is, then, spent, cannot be saved!  (Most windfall recipients end up broke, because they don't know how to save, or don't have a habit of saving, money.)<br>  <br>  Just think, how will you feel, when you make a commission off of selling that customer a library of knowledge that cannot, or will not, be used, by the customer?  After all, even Plato, many centuries ago, taught that wisdom is the correct use of knowledge!  Knowledge is worthless... unless it is applied!<br>  <br>  Especially, how will you feel, after selling a $1,500 to $21,000 program, when you learn that that same knowledge is shared, by other other reputable companies, for FREE?<br>  <br>  And those other companies, who share the information for FREE, allow the customer to put the $1,500 to $21,000 and more in the customer's own savings and investment accounts and develop good savings and investment habits!<br>  <br>  Naturally, those other licensed companies, and their licensed agents, actually earn significant incomes from installing those savings and investment programs!  That is the more effective way to get the job done, I believe!<br>  <br>  Remember, there are three major parties to the transaction, here, i.e. 1) the company, 2) the distributor and 3) the customer/client.  I prefer to do business where all three parties Win, Win, Win!<br>  <br>  As I have, for decades, I discuss the principles, and I let others make the decision!<br>  <br>  Phil<br>  <a href="http://www.phillipfostercpa.com/money.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phillipfostercpa.com/money.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.phillipfostercpa.com/advisory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phillipfostercpa.com/advisory...</a>|`|33d468491e9f22b6cb1f570604f04214aa	You are so right that you will find negative on anything if you look hard enough.

New construction is especially slow and, as a result, it seems that these builders are competing more aggressively in the home improvement business in order to manage through the slowdown and also to retain their best workers.  If new construction picks up, the climate for home improvement people should improve as builders return to new construction as their primary emphasis.

EzrdyxAiaa	go to any broker -- edwards jones is good and they have office through out the united states in most towns over 4k -- open up an accuont and you are on or way!!!|`|AA10250651	Here's what I would do.<br>  <br>  Do some research and pick one or more no load mutual funds that have a good track record. This can be done on such sites as www.morningstar.com or www.fidelity.com. You want to look for funds that have had good results for 1, 3 and 5 year time horizons (10 year also, if the fund has been out that long) and with the same portfolio manager the entire time.<br>  <br>  Contact the fund (or funds) and get them to send you information about opening an account with them. Get their phone numbers on their web sites.<br>  <br>  Set up an account with the fund (or funds) , make the required initial investment and set up a monthly investment program. Almost all funds have such programs.<br>  <br>  If you feel you can do the basic research on the funds (actually, it's not that hard with the automated research tools available), the is how you'll achieve the best long-term results.<br>  <br>  Remember, brokers need to make a living. Therefore, they can have a conflict of interest. If you feel you cannot do the required research, keep in mind that many brokers will direct you toward "load" funds where they receive an upfront commission or to other types of investments that will give them lucrative sales fees. Depending on the person, a broker might be the right way to go -- just be very cautious and personally investigate anything they suggest before investing. NEVER invest in something you do not fully understand. Also, make sure you only deal with well-known and established firms and NEVER give a broker the authority to make changes to your investment on his own without your prior approval of each and every transaction.

The problem is that you may not have reported the income you earned on the investment and the Investment Company sent notification to the IRS on the total transaction which probably included the $20K.

Just as the current state of your health mirrors the health habits you have followed over a longer period of time, so your credit score reflects your credit history. It means that building a high credit score takes time (although there are some shortcuts) and maintaining it is a continuous process. In this article, you'll find 5 ways to increase credit score and ensure you get good interest rates whenever you need credit.Before talking about the details on how to increase credit score, there are some basics you need to know. Credit score, or FICO score (the most commonly used credit score, created by the Fair Isaac Corp.), is a number ranging from 300 to 850 which is calculated with a mathematical model, using the information in your credit report. The number shows the lender the likelihood of you paying back the loan on time. The higher the score, the less risky it is for the lender to give you a loan and the better interest rate you are offered. If your credit score is 700 and above, you’re likely to get the best interest rates available.

sI3krJULaa	Yes, as long as that's how they measure time for payroll.  For instance, at my firm, we measure time in 6 minute increments.  But it has to work both ways- if you leave 5-10 minutes early, then they are not allowed to dock your pay.  That's how it works with some "clocks".  They only sign you in or out at certain increments.  I used to work at a hotel where the clock signed you in or out in 15 minute increments.  If you showed up for your shift at 1:01, it would record it as if you showed up at 1:15.  But it worked both ways- if you clocked out at 8:01, you were recorded as leaving at 8:15.<br>  <br>  The main thing about CA is fairness.

So yes, you don't get overtime unless you work a minimum of 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  It would be too hard for employers to be able to pay for 5 or 10 minutes, because a lot of employees would use this time to go to the toilet or loiter around talking, rather than working.  It happens a lot at my work (I'm in Australia).  So they might be five minutes late in clocking off, but they were not working.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, in my workplace, you need to get your overtime authorised before you commence it.  So if you have not cleared it with the boss, you don't get paid.  Which also sucks, but is fair enough.  We work in a factory, so it's not like anyone has to stay back to complete a task.  There are other people able to take over immediately when you are meant to leave.  Nobody is compelled at my work to do overtime.  <br>  <br>  I am pretty sure that in your country, in your state, that would be pretty standard procedure.  The fifteen minute limit helps to determine whether you were actually doing extra work, or just slow in getting to clock off.  Most people wouldn't waste a whole 15 minutes before they clocked off.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	Yup.  They can also withhold pay for OT if they have a written policy that states all OT must have signed authorization from a company manager or Owner before the OT is worked.  <br>  <br>  In California, the Employer holds all the marbles.|`|DWLbXd79aa	yeah, sucks huh

An insurance agent saw what that organization was doing and wanted to expand on it and open up a customer base to sell insurance to. He started American Association of Retired People which was called AARP for short.<br>  <br>  A few years back, the association wanted to expand and sell to a younger customer base so they dropped the name American Association of Retired People and officially changed their name to just the four letters AARP. Now AARP is their name NOT initials for anything.<br>  <br>  There, I bet that is MORE than you wanted to know.
y4SUDnpaaa	You could dispute the debt with the credit bureaus. They will remove the debt for 30 days to  give you  time to document the debt is not yours or has already been paid.     You must deal with the doctor's office to get the debt removed permanently. Go to the doctor's office, tell them the debt is not yours and to provide the information they used to determine it was your debt.  You can let the credit bureaus know that the doctor cannot prove this debt is yours, they will call him to confirm and if the doctor admits he has no such documentation and the debt should be removed.  If you already know this is your debt you should go ahead and pay it. Proving they didn't notify you until 2 years won't take it from your credit report, you still owe the money. Only by documenting it is not your debt or that you have already paid is the only way to have it removed.

Some examples include:<br>  <br>  1. Use 2nd class post not 1st - it is fine for most correspondence.<br>  2. If you have a high volume of post use a franking machine as the postage costs are lower<br>  3. arrange meetings so that you use the train for travel off peak instead of peak times<br>  4. dont use taxis unless absolutely necessary<br>  5. any subscriptions and memberships that dont generate value<br>  6. Look carefully at your marketing spend. (A few years ago I did an item by item marketing audit for a business and halved their marketing spend with no difference to their effectiveness).<br>  7. Budget carefully and dont spend above your budget. Lots of companies will ring you up trying to sell you stuff offering you a 'good deal' - dont go for it unless you need it and it was in your spending plans anyway.<br>  8. manage your utility spend - can you get a more cost effective deal (Utility Warehouse is very hard to beat on a consistent basis).<br>  9. If you have an office, do you need it? Or can you work from home?<br>  10. Can you rearrange your salary structure using salary sacrifice schemes and replace it with more tax efficient ways of remunerating your staff (e.g. childcare vouchers, mobile phones, extra holiday, etc). This will save you a lot in National Insurance.<br>  11. have you got surplus space/kit to sell or rent out?<br>  12. Are you paying for kit you dont really use - if so, get rid of it. It can sometimes be cheaper overall to hire kit you use infrequently rather than own it.<br>  13. Negotiate hard on prices. Be creative on financing deals, part exchanges and even barter.<br>  14. Get smaller motor vehicles. Look at lifetime costs and if you have high mileage petrol vehicles look at LPG conversions. If you have high mileage diesel vehicles look at chip fat conversion.<br>  15 Double check your fuel and resource efficiency and recycling schemes. Are you paying for stuff you are throwing away/wasting?<br>  16. Use virtual services wherever possible (e.g. telephone, VOIP, VA, etc)<br>  17. Look at your personal expenses - can you cut back, or even flip them legitimately into the business - which may restrict your ability to use them but can help with your wider cashflow position.<br>  <br>  One of the best ways of improving your profitability is actually to increase your margins as well. You can raise your prices even in the current climate if you pitch it well.<br>  <br>  Also remember that you are doing it for YOU - at times like this profitability is actually not very important.

(and as i know) even though they may freeze interest on your account they can still apply late charges, interest for that month if payment is missed. but payplan wont in the past year i've missed 3-4 payments and eventually reduced the monthly amount. but stick to it and its heaven compared to the abundance of attention you get when you're not paying. they are also quite flexible with payment (ie if you have sudden enexpected financial expense or if you need to raise/ lower your monthly payment.) a lot of creditors seem to be aware of them & often take your client ref number as reference give you a fax and payplan send them the relevant document. you may still recieve calls/ letters but simply explain payplan is dealing with it and its cuts back big time. check out their site. hope all this helps|`|aCDWwsisaa	"Less than 15%"????<br>  <br>  Why don't you just pay your debts yourself? That would only cost you the amount you owe!<br>  <br>  Debt consolidation is a scam.|`|xoqQbHi1aa	<br>  You need to get up to date on all of your accounts and pay off all of your bills. That is the only way to fix your credit and get out of debt. To do that you need to make some sacrifices. <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  <br>  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. The holidays are coming and there will be plenty of temporary jobs available. It is better to have a no fun year or two than a no fun decade. <br>  <br>  C.Whatever you do, DO NOT do a loan consolidation. It goes on your credit report like a bankruptcy, you end up owing more than when you started, and it takes you longer to pay it all off.<br>  <br>  D. If you have a car loan and owe more than $2,000 (or more than you can make at your part time job in 2 months) then sell the car. You will still owe the difference but that will free up a chunk of money every month. Find a cheap used car and pay cash for it. You can get a better car after you get yourself out of this hole.<br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan.<br>  <br>  |`|4XQzATWbaa	Consolidating all your debt into "One manageable monthly sum" is *not* the way out of your pickle.<br>  <br>  All they do is add all your debt together and then spread it over a really long time period and add a whacking great dollop of interest on it, so you can be paying them for years.<br>  <br>  Instead do this:-<br>  Write down all of your debts and the interest rate of each debt.<br>  Write down your:-<br>  Council Tax.<br>  Gas Bill (average monthly total).<br>  Electric (as gas)<br>  Water (as above 2).<br>  Travel expenses.<br>  Food purchases.<br>  Child care - if applicable.<br>  Subtract this from your monthly income. This leaves you your savings. <br>  <br>  Then, for one week write down every cash withdrawal you make and everything you purchase.  After a week, you'll be stunned at how much you are probably wasting on things you don't need - i.e., magazines, books, cd's, etc. <br>  <br>  Once you have worked out where you are spending un-necessarily, you can cut these items out.  <br>  <br>  Contact the companies you owe, explain you are experiencing financial problems at the moment and would like to make a slightly lower rate of payment for a few months.  Most will agree to this. <br>  <br>  Pay a larger monthly payment to the company that you have the biggest debt / charging the highest rate of interest *but* continue to make payments to the other companies.<br>  <br>  <br>  * ways to spend less *<br>  Shop at the end of the day when supermarkets cut their prices on use-by date food.

AA12065007	OK look here's the way it works.<br>  <br>  As long as you not using 30% or more of your credit limit then there is no difference score wise between paying the minimum or paying the full amount you just get stuck paying interest which is silly unless you have too.<br>  <br>  I use 3 cards for every thing I buy every month and always pay them off in full before the due date, due to the lapse in billing and due dates there is always a small balance to be reported but I never have to pay interest on it. I have done this now for 3-years and all 3 of my scores are well over 800.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	When I was 18, I got 2 credit cards.<br>  By the time I was 21 I had top 800+ scores.<br>  I paid in full each month - never paid a penny interest or fees.<br>  Just to let you know - you can get top scores without ever making banks rich.<br>  <br>  Some old ladies will tell you that carrying a balance is good.<br>  That's 100% myth - and I have no idea where this thinking comes from.<br>  /|`|AA10405438	Paying the minimum can hurt your credit score.  Your balance will go up with the interest accrued.|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Both of your statements are true.  Carrying a balance on credit cards hurts your credit because of the debt to income and debt to credit ratios.  However, making payments is good for credit building.  The more on time payments the better.<br>  <br>  The concern you should have is the cost of the credit.  Paying the minimum payment each time incurs interest charges and makes everything purchased with that credit card much more expensive.  Also, paying the minimum will mean you have a balance (debt) for many years to come.  Generally, it is better for you to pay the debt as soon as possible.|`|EI3T4nMSaa	Your credit score is basically used to predict the possibility that you won't pay your bills. Scores are compiled by Fair Isaac Corp. and are sometimes called FICO scores. The top possible number is 850, but topping 800 is probably unrealistic. A median score usually falls in the 720-to-725 range, meaning half of consumers fall above that point, half below.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	You are setting yourself up for needless expense.|`|QdtppqFPaa	Both statements are true.  Paying the minimum payment, as long as you are making payments on time, will not hurt your score.  But, keeping the balance of your card including interest over 30% of the limit can hurt your score.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Most of the modern homes have mortgages on them of $300,000 and the owners are trying to do a "short sale".  That is why they are $100,000.<br>  The older, uglier homes are selling for $100,000 but you can actually buy them; unlike a short sale.<br>  <br>  Or the ugly ones are all repossessed. Buckeye boomed in 2005. Now it is bust..|`|lys5kB9Daa	NO! Seriously do not buy a house down there. Come down to see them and you will see why. It is a really crappy area, there will be fenced off new construction and then right across the street is trailer parks and dumps. The homes in that area are not worth crap and they are just getting cheaper and losing value everyday. There is alot of open land in that area, so houses are built and sold for 140. Then a year later, they build a brand new community a block away and people are like "Well that one's newer for 140" so then the other house falls to 120. Then they build more a block away and the original one is down to 100. The values will never go back up because of all the newer homes being built around it, people will always pay more for those and since it's unlimited land right now, it will keep happening for years.<br>  There are some really good deals in Phoenix right now, but not that area. I would look into a place that will retain and regain it's value- North Phoenix, Tempe, NW Peoria, Surprise, Chandler. But even then be careful, the market is still falling here, make sure you come out and look at the house and the area first. There are alot of nice homes in really crappy areas.
SNllynBiaa	It will depend mostly on your credit score and history. If you have no credit history you will not be able to get a loan.
4ooXYuYFaa	You cannot take a loan out in someone else's name...that in and of itself would be illegal. But they can apply for the loan in their name...or maybe that person would apply for it jointly with you. At some point in the future after a series of payments have been made on time, the bank MIGHT be willing to remove the other person - but that is a huge hypothetical.  Technically, you are accomplishing the same thing and this may be what your actually meant. <br>  <br>  The same answer applies here. You could take out a loan in your name, but then no one else would be "required" to make the payments - only you. If this person is willing to guarantee or co-sign on the loan, then they too would be jointly responsible for the payments.|`|qBCGH52haa	Question 1 - No...what you would have to do is apply for a new loan in your own name and use that loan to pay off the first loan.<br>  <br>  Question 2 - As long as you qualify for the loan, you can take it out and have anyone pay for it.  Why you would do that is another question - you would be placing your credit rating on the line hoping the other person pays.

a59740ff0e38675e0ca589981d66e6a5aa	First let me offer my deepest sympathies on your loss.<br>  <br>  As your mum died intestate (without a will), everything in her name should go to her next of kin - in this case your dad, you and your sister would each inherit one third of her estate.<br>  <br>  Though since you say all of the property and cars are in both parents names they would all automatically become your dad's.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything that can legally be done to make your dad abide by his original promise, unless there was something in writing.  You had what is called a "verbal contract", and is not legally binding.<br>  <br>  Also, since you are over the age of 16 (and I assume so is your sister), your dad is not legally obligated to financially provide for you in any way.<br>  <br>  You should still get some professional advice from a solicitor though, so you know exactly where you and your sister stand legally.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	I think you need to speak to an estate attorney.  If you mom didn't have a will, there is a chance some of her estate might go to you and your sister.  It all depends on how the property was held in the estate.<br>  <br>  Technically, your dad's duty to support you ends at 18, and the fact that he will pay your rent means he is still supporting you somewhat.  Maybe ask your dad if he is willing to see something (one of the cars, perhaps) to give you a lump sum to spend on tuition.|`|104c298c569130856f8ea29d45c48c6caa	Well, I am afraid it's called growing up and fending for yourselves.<br>  Of course your Dad has no obligation to support two adults and seems to be more than generous in paying your rent. I don't wish to be rude but get real and learn what real life is all about. Your parents have done their bit and by the sound of they have done a good job. Your Dad deserves a life now without the worry of his offspring. Your parents have clearly worked hard and tried to give you the best education they can. It's your turn to learn how to survive and work in the 'real world'.|`|uTA2TLC6aa	Andrew W is right. You need some legal advice pronto.|`|8sFBxf6oaa	everything that is in their names legally belongs to them.  The fact that you get to live there is amazing on your part.  i wish someone would pay my mortgage every month!!<br>  <br>    You are an adult and are legally responsible for yourself.  giving someone your word before death means nothing legally.  without a will, you have few options.  if there was life insurance, or social security, you will have to check on those, because some monthly amounts or lump sums may go to you, but you would have to consult a lawyer that specializes in such. <br>  <br>   my children both receive monthly amounts from my late husbands social security.  there are age limits, but sometimes they are extended if you are in school.  Long story short, you have to stand on your own two feet.  it is hard, but that is how the world works.  good luck to you :)|`|Rx3C5c6qaa	Sorry to hear about your mum but prehaps its about time you took up a job. <br>  There are plenty of other students who get by on their own and you can still carry on your education and work at weekends or evenings. <br>  <br>  There will also be help available from the government, They will contribute towards your rent and council tax so you should see the local council about that but I don't think expecting your father to cover everything for you is fair on him. I believe you can also recieve help to pay for other bills and food so you should look into that.
AA12065007	Yes the increase in your credit limit means that your credit is getting better.<br>  <br>  Limited credit simply means the you either don't have enough trade lines or that the ones you do have, have been open long enough to have a good established payment history yet.<br>  <br>  The increase will also help lower you debt to credit ratio which makes up a full 30% of your score.<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work, never use more then 30% fo your credit line in any given month and pay it off in full before the due date and your score will skyrocket in no time.<br>  <br>  You also need to think about getting a second card like a Visa or Mastercard and use them the same way.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	You have little experience|`|Zp9GxGHiaa	If your department store is giving you additional credit, your score must be getting better.  Paying off your existing credit cards did raise your score.  <br>  <br>  You can check your credit score at <a href="http://www.creditkarma.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.creditkarma.com</a> for free.  Once you do sign up, there is a credit simulator on the site where you can see how paying off your debt will increase your score.  <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/simulator" rel="nofollow">https://www.creditkarma.com/simulator</a>
AA12065007	Obviously this is a question only you can answer.<br>  <br>  The extra your going to pay in interest is going to be huge, but on the other hand if that extra $100.00 a month means the difference between putting food on the table and a roof over you head then it's the way to go.<br>  <br>  Whichever you choose, good luck.

Find out what his loan is, and google fanny may , freddie mac|`|mZlPj8Guaa	They say that this recent problem we have is that you do more harm to abandon the house and payments than actually live in it. If your father is struggling with his payments, then he should notify the lender and maybe they can renegotiate the terms.<br>  <br>  I do not know what your father does. Weather he is working or not. Maybe you should talk to him to get reassurance from him.|`|4MypYVHYaa	There are several question that need answering before you can make a decision on keeping your father's house, or making a decision to do something else with the house.<br>  <br>  #1 Can your father continue to make the monthly mortgage payments?<br>  #2 Do your father plan to move to another place in a short period of time like the next 3-5 years?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes to #1 and no to #2 the value of the house is not a concern.<br>  <br>  If your father move he will have to pay someone rent. The end result is that he will not own what he rent.<br>  <br>  Eventually the value of your father's house will go back up and he would have paid down a lot of the principal.<br>  <br>  Under the scenario you outlined with the value of the house falling he can not refinance his house as of yet.<br>  <br>  You will not end up homeless if your father can continue to make the current monthly mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now there are some lenders that are reevaluating their loans they have with certain clients. You father's lender might be one of these lenders.<br>  <br>  You should call your father's lender and see if there is any help they can offer. You would want to speak to someone in the workout or modification department.<br>  <br>  Explain to them the fact that homes in the area where your father bought are now less than what he paid for the house and if they could  do something about lowering the loan amount to match the current value of the house.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|qBCGH52haa	If he could afford the payment before, hasn't lost his job and has no plans on selling/moving, the current worth of the house is irrelevant.  There is also a good chance that unless he has paid down the original mortgage quite a bit or made a large down payment when he bought it, he may be underwater (where the house is not worth what he owes).  In this situation, he can't refinance.<br>  <br>  The only time a house's value comes into play is: a) if you actually want to refinance (you need equity); b) if you want to move (your mortgage balance must be less than the selling price); or c) if you can no longer afford the payments (in which case, you have to hope you have equity or face a short sale and/or foreclosure).

ATlZiDw9aa	With a good credit history, you can make a down payment and purchase a car or a house.  <br>  You can go into Sears or Penny's and purchase an item even with no down payment.  <br>  You must always make the minimum payment before the due date.  It will reduce the amount of interest they charge if you make much larger payments each month. <br>  You are much better off to get a personal loan from a bank rather than carry a large outstanding balance on your credit card since a personal loan has a smaller monthly interest rate, often less than half as much.<br>  ...

BoAEgaAGaa	It is true that the expenses for a child in pre-school below the level of kindergarten do qualify for the child and dependent care credit.  Now if the costs of the schooling are separable from the cost of the child's care, only the cost of the care is used in figuring the credit.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the expenses must be paid for a period while the taxpayers are working, looking for work or full time students.  <br>  <br>  If you fit all the requirements, you will file a form 1040X, amended income tax return.

There are some easy ways to determine what items are hot using some tools on the web that are free such as: twitter, google trends, and amazon itself. Shoot me an email and I will help point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  You might also consider using Craigslist to sell some of your items or look for items that you think that you could turn around and sell for a profit either on craigslist, ebay or amazon.<br>  <br>  You might also consider doing a garage sale yourself. Look around your house and garage and Im sure you can find all kinds of items that you could easily part with until you get back on your feet.<br>  <br>  Do not get caught up in the hype on the internet: stuffing envelopes, taking surveys, get rich overnight with google. Those things are scams.If you want to make money on the internet via internet marketing then you need to get involved in those communities and seek out honest people. That's easier said than done, I know because I have burned way too many times within that space. But, fortunately I now know who to talk to and what education will help springboard you into a successful venture online. I too, needed to supplement my income and I finally made my extra money via niche marketing. For those people who actually know what they are doing, they can make a steady income to either supplement their current income or replace it entirely. Now, not everyone can do this but those who follow the right people and learn from trusted sources can really make a difference in their financial situation. I'm no guru but I know honest people in the business who train others to become successful online.<br>  Let me know if you would like their info.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and hope that those ideas will help you along.

wd5rksMoaa	You want to cut production, that would eliminate jobs which to me is the most important part.  If the people working at the car companies want to keep their jobs why not take a salary cut for a year or two.  <br>  Which is better making $40.00 an hour (most are making $50.00+ an hour) or being unemployed.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Your proposal isn't from a well informed standpoint.<br>  <br>  Production is already being cut. Prices are already being cut. Rebates and other incentives are already in place.
2GHnbyC2aa	While I generally agree with the answers given I think its important to understand the factors that you are confronting.  First, closing inactive accounts is a relatively new trend in late 2008 and 2009.  Credit card companies are trying to lighten their credit load by canceling credit that is not being used.  I think this makes sense, but it can hurt you.  They tend not to cancel cards that are being used, but I would suggest (maybe for the first time!) to keep a small balance on the cards you plan to keep.  Usually, they will not cancel cards with an open balance, but if you simply pay off your balance after charging something, it will do no good because the credit card company makes no money.  They will cancel your account in a flash during 2009!   As usual, this is a game where you need to balance the realities.  In my opinion, it is much better to keep accounts open in 2009 (and your account open) and pay a little interest to the credit card company.  Final thing though, check those interest rates and either cancel the cards with high interest rates or give the company a call an ask them to reduce it (yes it is that simple...just tell them that you got an offer with a teaser rate and you are thinking of canceling your card unless they can do something for you).  Sorry, if I rambled, but I thought you needed to hear all the angles.|`|PTyYSdxbaa	It hurts your credit if you have credit cards and never use them, even if the account is left open. Every couple of months or so, buy something small on the card, and pay it off immediately.

If they are able to provide one and it is not your signature then you will need to file a police report and be willing to send you cousin to jail for forging your signature.  The utility company then may either take it off your report or settle on the account for less, but you will need to supply a copy of the police report to them.<br>  <br>  If they are not able to produce your signature, then contact the credit reporting agency and dispute the charge/listing stating that the electric company doesn't have your signature on anything.<br>  <br>  Double check your lease though, it may state you are jointly responsible for all charges that occur on the property.  Also, how long ago was this account opened by your cousin?  If it has been a year or so the utility company may ask why you did not dispute the account until now (a valid point, you "enjoyed positive credit reporting" until it became negative).|`|Gun3UGzaaa	It depends on how the electric service was set up.  If your cousins opened it up and all of you used the electricity, then yes, you are on the hook for the money.  The electric company can hold all or you, or any one of you, responsible for the money.

80b8cc51687afa4b940b8a3d2bef0a46aa	I'm very sorry, but you are going to have to do your own homework.
Gun3UGzaaa	Well, this is a complicated decision.  It really depends on how old you are, how close to retirement you are, and what else you would do with this money, and what interest rate you are paying.<br>  <br>  If you would otherwise spend it on things you don't really need, then sure.  <br>  <br>  If you are paying an interest rate above 6%, then I definitely would.  There is nothing you can invest in right now that will pay you at least 6% without any risk.<br>  <br>  If you are within 5 years of retirement, then it might be a great idea because you can retire without worrying about a big house payment.<br>  <br>  As far as the tax savings go, it isn't as much of a savings as people think.  Most people do not save a whole lot in taxes due to to their mortgage.  If you are married, the IRS gives a standard deduction of more than $10,000.  So, you really only get a tax deduction when your mortgage and state income taxes are greater than $10,000.  If they are close to the $10,000, then you don't save that much, because you would have gotten $10,000 anyway.<br>  <br>  Look at what your schedule A says.  If you are paying $12,000 a year in interest, and another $2,000 a year in property taxes, and $5,000 a year in state income taxes, then instead of getting $17,000 in deductions, you will only get about $10,000.  This means you only save the taxes on $7,000 of lost interest payments.  If you are in a 25% tax bracket, the lost tax savings is 7,000 x 25%=$1,750.<br>  <br>  But, you are getting back $12,000 in interest and only losing $1750 in tax savings.<br>  <br>  The only reason to not do this is if you will need that $500k in retirement, or if you have young children you might need to help with going to college.  If you don't have enough retirement income, then you might want to hold onto some of this money, because once you pay off a house, it is very expensive and difficult to get that money back.<br>  <br>  One option you might want to consider is to use the inheritance to pay off all debts you might have (credit cards, car loans, etc)., then set aside an amount equal to ten month's living expenses for an emergency or job loss.  Then, if there is still a substantial amount left,  payoff the house.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	pay it off - anyone who says different is a complete moron<br>  <br>  if they had the chance, why would anyone continue to pay $1000 a month mortgage, where you only get maybe a 25% tax reduction on the mortgage interest??? you  are still paying $100's a month net. Pay off the mortgage and use that money you WERE paying and invest it.<br>  keep at least another $100k in emergency savings - pay off all debts and loans - and then, when the need arises, buy a 2 yr old car with low mileage - better value than a brand new one - put money away for kids college funds if you have kids or plan to. if you have a 401k plan - try and contribute the maximum this year and next year (15k-22k depending on age). same for spouse if applicable or at least max out an IRA. buy new energy efficient appliances for the house - get extra insulation put in, new windows if needed - anything to help you save more money|`|GwXJpZWKaa	ummm yeah|`|3tuwWidiaa	Convention wisdom says not to pay off the mortgage.

Because, should something terrible happen (lose job, illness, etc.), it's easier to pull money from a savings account, CD, or even the stock market than from your house.<br>  <br>  If you lose your job, you can always dip into savings THEN in order to pay your monthly mortgage.<br>  <br>  However, there is something to be said about not having the mortgage hanging over you.

The argument "you're an idiot if you pay off your mortgage due to taxes" that people have been telling you is lame.  Here's why:<br>  <br>  For every $1 in interest you pay on a mortgage, you'll get back about 30 cents from the government.  So, you have to spend $1 to get back 30 cents.  In essense, you're giving the bank 70 cents while the government gives you back 30 cents.  Why not pay off the house, keep the 70 cents you'd have given the bank, but now you are keeping and give the government the 30 cents for the taxes.<br>  <br>  Most of the sheeple out there have been brainwashed into this kind of garbage.  There interest you'd pay on the house if you went the full 30 years would be as much as the principal.  Doesn't make any sense does it?  Pay off the mortgage, keep the 70 cents you'd have given the bank.|`|dDjAbagnaa	If you can afford to do so then do it, you will still have 300K left so I would say do it(one less bill to worry about).

qBCGH52haa	All you can do is request that companies remove them...they are under no obligation to remove them (they just have to mark them paid).  A credit report is a personal history of how you have handled your finances.  If all companies removed past due bills, the credit report would be worthless since folks could clean up their history immediately by paying off stuff, and thus would not reflect how they actually handled their finances in the past.<br>  <br>  As I said, about the only thing you can do is request that the negative reports be removed (don't expect them all to be removed) and make sure that those that haven't been removed are correctly marked as paid off.

dgsFDJdMaa	With a prepaid credit card, you pay a fee to get the card as well as fees every month just for having the card, fees for using the card, fees for adding more money to the card, etc.  This type of card is useful for people who are not eligible to get a traditional credit card because they do not have any credit history or they have bad credit history.  As a person's credit history improves, it is in their best interest to get a regular credit card that doesn't have so many fees.<br>  <br>  The prepaid credit card looks just like a regular credit card.

This will show that you are an animal shelter that takes pride in the wellbeing of the animals you care for and that you are against mills.<br>  <br>  And because it will be a charity event, you can probably get some free PR exposure from smaller newspapers and radio stations.

O8qdCBzLaa	I recommend you don't get involved in buying REOs and reselling them as a conventional property until you learn the laws about purchasing REOs versus conventional properties. That's a very risky proposition. You're just setting yourself up to lose money on every transaction, if you end up having to fix the problems that the bank didn't have to disclose, but that you will be responsible for before reselling the properties. <br>  <br>  And, even if the property was in tip-top condition with no legal issues (liens, code violations, etc.), why would someone pay more for a property that was just on the market for more than it just went for, when property values are still declining right now?<br>  <br>  House flipping only works when the prices are going up fast. When they're stable or decreasing, not so much if at all. And, there's a particularly high element of risk when the property is originally a REO.|`|AA11173563	investment purchases take 25% down payment at least. They will not count leases as income unless you have at least 30% equity in your rental units. The rest is just like any other mortgage|`|ZcFGa97Raa	you've got some good advice already. using llc's can be a great way to avoid assignment issues and seasoning issues when you resale.  flipping property that you purchase on the mls is difficult because the value of the property has already been established.  unless you do something to substantially alter the value of the property you won't be able to flip the house.<br>  <br>  your funding is a little ambiguous because that will also make a difference.  if you're using hard money or a private investor you'll be fine but if you're using conventional financing you are in the wrong business.  conventional financing is good if you are holding the property but you sign documents that keep you from flipping the property (through prepayment penalties), or these institutions will stop lending to you at all.<br>  <br>  this is not the economy to make mistakes. i'd check out your local real estate investors association and work with an experienced investor before tackling a new investment on your own.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	That's easy.<br>  <br>  First, though, contact local real estate investment groups in your area. Go to <a href="http://www.creonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.creonline.com</a> and, on the left-hand side, click on "local groups." Find North Carolina and click there. That'll bring up local clubs. Find some in your area and network with them. They'll be a great help.<br>  <br>  Your question is confusion in that you say "i didnt have the cash to buy the reos" but "i do have the funding."<br>  <br>  The REO contracts can't be assigned, so they have to be bought in yoru name...or in the name of an LLC. One technique a lot of investors use is to set up an LLC. They purchase the property in the name of the LLC. Then they sell the LLC which, in turn, is the owner of the property. Or...once the contract is approved by the bank, they sell the LLC. The contract is still good; it remains in the name of the LLC. It's just that the owner of the LLC has changed.<br>  <br>  If you do have the funding--for instance, if you have a hard money lender lined up--then you just buy in your own name or in the name of your LLC. Then you sell the property.<br>  <br>  There's also a new breed of lender--not hard money but termed "dough for a day." They'll finance a transaction so long as they're repaid the next day. So if you can line up a buyer, you borrow the money from a "dough for a day" operation, buy, and then immediately sell to someone else. That doesn't work if you're planning on listing it in the MLS, but it's fine if you've lined up a buyer in advance.<br>  <br>  So, that's how it's done.

However, the focus is generally on issues such as career exploration, career change, personal career development and other career related issues (Swanson, 1995). Typically when people come for career counselling they know exactly what they want to get out of the process, but are unsure about how it will work (Galassi, Crace, Martin, James, and Wallace, 1992).<br>  <br>  Career counsellors work with people from all walks of life such as adolescents looking to explore career options or with experienced professionals looking for a career change. Career counsellors typically have a background in psychology, vocational psychology, or industrial/organizational psychology (Swanson & Parcover, 1998).<br>  <br>  The approach of career counselling varies by practitioner, but generally they include the completion of one or more assessments (Swanson & Parcover, 1998). These assessments typically include: interest inventories, cognitive ability tests, and personality assessments.

AA10215237	These low priced stocks are very volatile and highly risky.  You could double your money on an uptick or loss it on a down.  AIG is essentially a bankrupt company that is only existing by the grace of the US Gov't's bailout.  Unlike a typical investment, this is not a situation where the numbers and estimates will give you as much guidance.  <br>  <br>  If you want to leap in, follow the charts for a few days.  If it is still trending down, don't jump on that sinking ship.  If it shows signs of coming up, take a short ride to get the gains. Sometimes, you can try to pay the ups and downs.  But, you run the risk of being caught in a permanent down trend and losing the $$.<br>  <br>  This type of investing takes a strong stomach.  Do not invest money you are not prepared to lose.  If it were instant cash, everyone would buy it.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the broad proposition that a company that has failed in the past is destined to be a poor investment in the future.  CVS, for instance, filed for bankruptcy years ago and it is now a decent stock.  Other companies re-emerge with better leadership and become decent investments.  That said, AIG has not proven itself to be one of those companies and, right now, we must assume that it is not a good choice.|`|CDqKAIEAaa	Rebecca:<br>  <br>  Learn this, and never forget:<br>  <br>  It is never smart to buy anything that has proven<br>  failure.

AA10259042	I am not familiar with MetLife funds, but I would imagine that it is a money market fund.  They do in general have stable value although there was a very big deal about 6 months ago when a certain money market fund did loose value, so it is a possibility although it should not happen. Annual returns from money market funds currently is very low, about 1.0% annually or perhaps even less.  <br>  <br>  These are very difficult times for investors and for even non-investors too. It is extremely difficult to know the correct course to take.  <br>  <br>  Although I think it is wise for you to have a certain portion of you 401k in a stable investment option,  I also believe that it would be to your advantage to continue to contribute to the index fund.  After all you would be investing at a much lower price than you were--50% lower--so the chance of regaining your losses will be better in the long run by continuing your contributions--maybe.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	First of all, you should never have all your funds in 1 mutual fund.<br>  2nd, if your company has an option to buy company stock, that is where a large portion of your contribution should be going.

iaugc41aaa	Something doesn't sound right here.  If there has been a repossession, the mortgagee in possession is legally required to sell for the best price reasonably obtainable.  The fact of you not having sold your property yet does not matter in the slightest: you are prepared to make a higher offer and should be considered first.<br>  <br>  I do not know what the agency is playing at, but they are certainly not acting as they ought to do and could easily find themselves being sued if they are not careful.<br>  <br>  Try to establish who the agent is acting for, and write direct to the seller, pointing out that you are prepared to offer more, but that you believe that your bid is not being passed on.  That should scare up some action.|`|TKDi70uTaa	dont bother with the agent. make a direct bid as long as you are able to get the mortgage. it sounds like the agent is being greedy, bypass him.|`|b3889ee355f01fc906d1159fd12fa66daa	get a lawyer involved, or offer the new buyer 10k plus asking price to move out!!!|`|oFiGyMWraa	Other answers are correct in saying that the lender has a legal duty to get the best price reasonably available.<br>  <br>  However, a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush. They already have a buyer ready to proceed. You don't have a mortgage offer yet, nor have you sold your house. In the current market these might both take some time. Even if you decide to rent your current house it would take some time to get it up to spec to rent (you need all sorts of certificates, safety checks etc). <br>  <br>  Even the seller did decide to go with your offer and wait for you to get everything sorted it might take several weeks or more. In this time the debt owed by the old owner is going up as interest is added. The costs of selling are also added on to what they owe and they have now increased by having to start again with you as a new buyer. Also house prices are falling and if they wait a few more weeks your lender might decide that the agreed price is too high and insist it is reduced. And this does not take account of the fact that anything might go wrong so that you have to pull out after all.<br>  <br>  All in all the lender is almost certainly acting reasonably in requiring that you have a mortgage offer and a sold house, so are in a position to proceed quickly, before they listen to your offer.
AA10565336	Alterfem is correct as far as she went.  You can't legally get the tax advantages you are seeking but you can get some depreciation on a rental.<br>  <br>  All you will hear are opinions and since mine doesn't stink any more than anyone else's does I may as well give it to you.  IMO you may have already missed the BEST time to get in but not by much.  If you are going to buy now, then do it fast.  <br>  <br>  A second option I see is as follows:  President Obamas's financial "Plan" is calling for people who are upside down right now to get help.  His idea of help is essentially a loan refinance of up to 105% of the current value and a five year reduced interest rate.  Does this sound familiar???  Yeah, to me too.  This is another Adjustable Rate Mortgage.  The people in trouble now and those who have already walked are in the situation because they bought more house than they could afford by using "Creative" financing up to and including reverse amortization.  What do you suppose will happen the day these five year ARMs start adjusting and people's payments double or more?  I think there will be another window in about five years when you can buy at significant discount.<br>  <br>  OK, there's my opinion.  The decision is yours and Good Luck...|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Can't use that $8000 for a fixer upper. It's only for first time buyers. And if you think you can get a loan on false pretenses, & use that $8000 - think Federal prison. <br>  <br>  It may not be the wisest investment at this time. There are two big issues, #1 housing prices could still decline, #2 there aren't enough buyers out there right now. If you spend your money fixing this up and it's sits on the market for more than 60 days, you have pretty much lost your investment.  The day's of flipping are over, unless you are a big time investor with ton's of cash or people who will provide money for you to invest.  I would think of another line of work right now.|`|623934c31086693092ea968550fb1d23aa	I will answer the way I answered before from my research today- There are areas reporting multiple bids and it's not spring yet. By the time that people figure out the market has shifted , it's on the way up. Then all the people afraid they are missing the boat will start buying- and you will see multiple offers and market surge. I don't think it will be slow, I think people will be afraid to miss that once in a lifetime deal and I think it will be like the day after Thanksgiving sales. Why? Because that's human nature- no one wants to miss out. <br>  Look at the posts that have been discussing multiple offers , it's starting (and according to some financial analysts , the hard hit areas, CA, NV, FL are starting first

Hx88UGlpaa	You can try Captial One Auto Finance to see if you can get approved for a re fi....if you have made good payment history since your bankruptcy, you shouldn't have any problems. The bankruptcy you filed will come off your credit report after 10 years from the discharge date of your filing, so you should have it drop off in 2010. If you can hold on until then, re finance after the bk falls off and get a better percentage rate, you still could get a high percentage with a bankrutpcy showing. Once again, depends on how you've re established and paid your bills since the filing. Good Luck!
Ch9TedMcaa	You are correct.|`|uBtWPy7Gaa	You're right on both counts. A decline in US consumer income will weaken the economy, and therefore the US Dollar will depreciate.  However if there is a decline in foreign products bought, then this could cause an increase in manufacturing and industrial production in the US, that would strengthen the dollar. Overall though, it would become weaker in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Having said all that however, these types of economic data have less impact on the currency markets than they used to. The main driver is financial and economic news such as the bailouts that are happening. This is having a much bigger impact on the values of currencies worldwide.
RhEhzGbraa	When you applied for health insurance you signed an authorization form for the insurance company to access your medical records--it was in the fine print.  In addition on the application I am quite sure that they asked you about your medications.  To verify all the information you provided on the application, the health insurance company can access your medical records directly with your doctor and/or other providers and also go through a company called Medical Information Bureau (MIB).  You can find out more information about MIB at  <a href="http://www.mib.com/html/consumer_guide.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.mib.com/html/consumer_guide.h...</a>  Unfortunately many people forget to include relevant information in their health and life insurance applications and some people just outright omit the information or lie about their medical records.  Because of this health and life insurance companies share the information through MIB which is absolutely legal for them to do so.<br>  <br>  If you would like to check your records to make sure all the information is accurate, you can contact MIB at their website for requesting records which is  <a href="http://www.mib.com/html/request_your_record.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.mib.com/html/request_your_rec...</a><br>  <br>  In terms of your insurance, I hope that you will re-apply with another company and that you will provide them with all of your relevant health information.  If you provide all the information in the beginning, the underwriting and/or approval of your application should be a lot quicker.  Also you might want to find an independent agent who specializes in health insurance since he or she might have access to several companies and will be able to find one that can approve you in spite of your excessive pharmacy use.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!

2N6oTOLQaa	Normally I wouldn't say you're entitled to any discount just because someone else is living in a bedroom that was previously empty. However, since you are going from having a private bathroom to having a shared bathroom, its worth asking your landlord if you can get $50-$100 off each month. He/She is still money ahead each month by adding the new tenant. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that since you have no written lease your landlord can raise your rent or kick you out with just 30 days notice. So if you like the situation and think you're getting a fair deal, then I wouldn't recommend you push the issue too hard. If you piss off your landlord you could quickly loose your right to live there altogether. <br>  <br>  It never hurts to politely ask for a discount for sharing a bathroom.|`|15a15c2941c45279684557afa9aaa35faa	yes, you should ask; now that i'm going to share the bathroom with some strange person; are you going to lower my rent?? if he say no, be prepare with an answer.|`|t2dx9C3qaa	I hope he let you know when he rented to you - that he would rent out that other room sooner or later.<br>  If not, then call and say that was not part of the agreement..

What you need to do is call back get another person and if they dont give u the answer you want talk to the manager then if they dont give you the answer you want call back and get someone else. Hopefully someone will have enough common sense to accept your deal. Dont give them a post dated payment though without it in writing from them because they will put it through to your bank  early. When you call tell them if they dont accept you dont know what you might have to do...hint that you may file "bankruptcy". They shouldn't accepted the half payment if they wouldn't take the other payment later. If you paid in a check you could call and say you might be forced to put a stop on the check and just let them come get the car. The fact of the matter is if drive wanted the car they would have came and got it after 90 to 120 days non payment like they did to my finance. They are just using the Idea of charge off to scare you into paying, it really doesn't mean that much. All this company uses is scare tactics. Also check the FDCPA I found that they violate this act all the time and if they do and you can prove it they will have to pay. When you call to make the final payment  ask them to agree to remove the acct or at least any negative information from your credit report. Have them send you it in writing. So you get a perk out of paying it off.<br>  <br>  Goodluck you will need it.

AA10566552	I think the odds of Congress suspending mark to market accounting rules in the coming weeks are about 50-50.  Many people believe that the post-Enron mark to market accounting rules significantly contributed to the current economic crises. The theory is based on the belief that banks and other financial institutions were forced to mark their baskets of loans down to ridiculously low prices because the market for these products was frozen, and buyers were only offering fire sale prices. Essentially, banks were forced to mark these assets down to the level of the highest bid. The problem is that the highest bid might be at 30% of the face value of the basket. The reason for the lack of buyers of these products is because of lack of visibility to the number of defaults that would occur within the basket. Prior to these rules, companies were allowed to "estimate" the value of their assets.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the mark to market accounting rules did contribute to the current economic collapse, but they were not the underling cause. The cause of the collapse was that more and more buyers were pressured into the housing market due to artificially low interest rates post-911, and investors bid the market up to unsustainable levels. Suspending the mark to market rules may provide some relief, but only time will solve the crisis.|`|6n527pAYaa	It would help stabilize the markets - but it won't happen because the powers that be don't want institutions value their own securities.

Unlike etrade and other brokers you dont need to trade a minimum of stocks per quarter to avoid any fees! So you can buy low, forget about them, and sell high later whenever your ready as their aren't any maintenance fees. Other sites also require a large deposit that has to be wired from your bank account.<br>  With Scottrade there are many local branches that you can sit down with a person open an account and drop off a check (min $500) making it alot safer. And if their are any problems their just a 10min drive away.<br>  And forget about e-trades $10+ per trade. At Scott's $7 bucks a trade is solid.<br>  Don't wanna pay $7 use this code when opening account... <br>  ReferALL code: RWFQ4282 <br>  Referred by: MARTIN MICHAEL NIESSEN <br>  You get your 1st 3 trades for free And if you refer anyone else you get 3 more for free.<br>  And since your looking into penny stocks its nice they only make you deposit $500 as others ask for alot more.<br>  Have anymore questions feel free to email me at jackoblades6@yahoo.com|`|SHqHD2lxaa	Most online brokers offer access to the penny market. I personally use Etrade and have had good luck with getting orders filled.<br>  <br>  Another poster suggested Scottrade, but Scottrade limits the quantities of a stock you can buy. This is important in the penny market because sometimes you may be trying to buy several million shares at a time.<br>  <br>  Be careful in this market, and learn everything you can about it before investing. You can get a jump start on learning about penny stock trading by reading the free articles on the site listed below. Again, go easy here and always take profits and cut your losses short by exiting losing trades.
84y9AOSYaa	I think so.  Check out "When a Debt is Cancelled" #6.  Most likely, the company's internal policy is not to sue after the statute of limitations has expired.

It doesn't have to be over the internet, of course, but it's a good start for any type of business.<br>  <br>  I used to develop web pages and buy and sell video games on Ebay. If you are into fashion you could try flipping clothing and accessories on Ebay, or even designing and making your own clothing for sale (and then modelling it, too!).

bf37e59acb66f2b681869127c87b5c66aa	nope never heard of them but company can be started based on demand. like when everybody was reclaiming bank charges all those sudden adverts to reclaim through them. i use payplan. they're quite good but it does take a bit of time to set up everything (its the only one i've used so nothing to compare them to) plus they dont add charges for the service. so what you pay is what they distribute unless you have payment protection with them which is fairly reasonal. they also do other financial services eg insurance. interest charges may still be applied to your account its at the discretion of your creditor. (and as i know) even though they may freeze interest on your account they can still apply late charges, interest for that month if payment is missed. but stick to it and its heaven compared to the abundance of attention you get when you're not paying. they are also quite flexible with payment (ie if you have sudden enexpected financial expense or if you need to raise/ lower your monthly payment.) they also provide you with a special client website log in & password where you can keep track of what going on who's getting paid what and when send them emails request info etc. a lot of creditors seem to be aware of them & often take your client ref number as reference give you a fax and payplan send them the relevant document. you may still recieve calls/ letters but simply explain payplan is dealing with it and its cuts back big time. hope all this helps|`|ClCQIjZHaa	A few years ago i used a company like that,they came to my house and went into all my finances then they wanted ￡300 which i had to pay over several months i still received letters and phone calls from my creditors when i tried to phone the debt company i could not get through in the end i sent them a letter to say i was not happy and wanted my money back in which they did but only ￡50|`|332dd8467b31eeba85e0c5b0ec33f75aaa	Just dont pay them any money, you can get this service free from the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, they have a good web site and they are brilliant at what they do, they will give you all the advice you need and you talk to a real person over the phone, who will see you through the process.<br>  <br>  |`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	The only way that anyone can guarantee to get the interest stopped and the debt paid within a reasonable time is with an Individual Voluntary Arrangement. This can only be done by a licensed insovency practitioner. If these people are offering just a 'debt management plan' the interest may well not be stopped and your creditors may want increased payments after the initial agreement. If you have no property, and no assets (eg a car worth over ￡1500ish) then bankruptcy may be a better option for you. You will still pay towards your debts if you can afford to.

Vq8Szjs9aa	First off, the website:  You would want to put a Terms of Use and Copyright statement on your website that all content on the website is property of ABC Clothing company and that it may not be copied, reproduced, etc. etc....without the express written consent of ABC Clothing company (if that is your desire).<br>  <br>  Regarding the use of ABC Clothing Company, you generally do not trademark a complete company name.  I suppose you could trademark ABC as it relates to your Clothing Company, but this would depend largely on whether or not someone has already trademarked it in affiliation with a clothing company.  So, for example let's say your company was called Steeplechase, Ltd. and you made running shoes.  You could apply to the USPTO for a trademark for "Steeplechase" and you would indicate that it is applicable to clothing (shoes).  If approved, it is strictly for clothing (or whatever code they attach to it).  You can't then go and put it on your new bicycle line without first (again) applying for it for the new product line through the USPTO.  Well you could as long as no other entity is already using Steeplechase in connection with a bicycle line.  Your next question is likely, "Why don't I just apply for "Steeplechase" as my trademark and list every possible use?"  It's because each separate category you apply it to in filing your trademark application incurs a separate fee.  In other words, it is going to cost you a lot of money.  <br>  <br>  To recap, search your preferred trademark name through the USPTO and pay attention to what category previous applicants have attributed it to.  If there are 100 listings for ABC (or whatever name you are applying for) and none of them apply to your industry/product, then you should be fine.  Of course, this doesn't mean that the USPTO can't still reject it as being too similar to something else already in use.

82LusQuKaa	Just go to the items sold. Click on send invoice and away it goes! They will pay you via Pay pal and then you ship the tickets. Easy peazy. If all else fails go to the HELP section of selling in E Bay. Good luck. Tagger|`|kgKyn68Raa	Depending on what kinda payment options you asked for. If its paypal you can wait a couple days to see if you receive any payments. Ebay automatically will email the winning bidder requesting their payment and it will have the correct links in the email so they can pay you. The invoice should really be used if you hear nothing in a couple days. Be sure to check  your ebay account and paypal accounts. If you have no paypal account then use the invoice to send out your address so you can receive payment. <br>  <br>  If you STILL don't get anything back from them send them a personal email. I would wait about a 5 days for that.

bf37e59acb66f2b681869127c87b5c66aa	ok why is everybody so negative, yes he went overdrawn it happens to the best of us at the worst of times. yes he signed the papers and no we don't all sit comfortably in the branch when opening our account to read the extra small print nor does the bank put their charges in bold or make it the first page in the welcome pack. has no one apart from rory p heard of or successfully reclaimed their charges. you've paid the charge which is extortionate now claim it back along with every other charge over the last 6yrs for every bank account credit card & catalogue you've had. IT DOESN'T COST THEM ￡30 or ￡25 or ￡5 to send a letter. despite the case currently being reviewed in court you can still file for a refund and it works even more so in your favour if you can prove you're suffering financial hardship and/or on benefits. i did it 3 times, twice prior to the case & once during and won all three. don't be put off by the current case or people who don't want to enforce their rights because they signed a piece of paper. i'm feeling the financial pinch (and looking to claim on other accounts) aren't you.

The use of a checking account is akin to using IOU's to pay - and you are promising that you have the cash in the account to back it up.  If you don't, then you are making empty promises of payment - and in the banking industry, that is called THEFT.

FA1l64EOaa	Absolutely not!  Your employer has NO right to do that to you.  If you have a pre-existing condition which was aggravated at work, the workers' compensation carrier is obligated to treat you until you reach the "baseline" of recovery (the condition you were in before the injury was aggravated).  Since your employer is asking you to do this, I would suggest contacting a workers' compensation attorney and filing a claim petition.  Now you need to protect yourself in case your employer starts to harass you.  The reason why your employer does not want you to be covered is because the comp premium may increase if there are too many losses at your place of employment.  That depends on the frequency and severity of losses.  The employer is just trying to save money by coercing you to lie.  As I said, take this matter to a work comp attorney and get rolling with it because who knows what your employer will dream up next.

bf37e59acb66f2b681869127c87b5c66aa	ok, firstly good on you for claiming back YOUR money. cant believe some people actually think its legal for the banks to charge these extortionate rates when it only costs thema few quid. <br>  <br>  next thing is by you getting a refund and the bank closing your account its sort of them implying time for you to get lost. what you should have done was open another account before filing to claim your charges back "plan b"<br>  <br>  but if you haven't done so or don't have another account elsewhere:<br>  1: exhaust your banks complaints procedures and keep records of these. and if they still fail to budge<br>  2: report them to the Financial Ombudsman as they could be breaking the banking code and the Ombudsman can rule in your favour. but you MUST exhaust the banks complaints procedure first.  you can also claim additional compensation for the grief it will cause you. and i haven't a clue how long that will take<br>  <br>  from what i've read, banks aren't allowed to do so but they will try. at the very least they could mark you on their systems as a difficult customer. however this nor you reclaiming your charges should not have an effect on your credit rating, so not quite sure why you're having difficulty opening another account elsewhere.<br>  <br>  however if your credit score was poor prior to this, some banks eg halifax do credit checks before accepting to give you an account, maybe you should be looking for a more simple account like a cash card account rather than a current account. there's a range of accounts available|`|AA11047516	They cannot close your account legally but they may be able to black ball you under the table.
