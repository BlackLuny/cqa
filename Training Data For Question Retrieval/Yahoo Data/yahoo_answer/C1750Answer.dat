cZ7UWrvXaa	Because of all the negative information circulating about the Jews, people choose to believe what is told to them instead of finding out for themselves. The information is out there for everyone with an open mind but many people do not want to take the time to find out for themselves and just repeat what is the popular line at the moment. They prefer to follow the masses than hold a different view.|`|tod8jy9Paa	For once I agree with Tambovi. I now live in Bulgaria and during WW2 this country was pro German but when the Nazis told the government here to make all Jews wear arm bands to  identify them so they could easily be rounded up and sent to concentration camps, every single citizen here put on these arm bands so the Nazis were unable to remove a single Jew. Now that's what I call a nobel gesture by the Bulgarians and in fact few even know about it . Not a single Jew was ever taken out of Bulgaria.|`|LyJaMD5xaa	cuz all of the people that deny the Holocaust are hitler bum chums and nazi sympathisors and they should be put through the same horror and torture that the jews went through then we'll see if they deny it then!!!!!!!|`|yaq7oaH6aa	They'd rather go to jail then face it.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	And who says the Europeans say such a stupidity?i live in Europe,travel over Europe quite a lot,but I have never heard that a normal European said such a thing.<br>  Muslims -yes,they say such-and worse-idiocies quite often.But what have muslims to do with normalcy and with being an European?|`|uJhrqJCDaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  Further, saying something like that doesn't make any sense seeing as how there is overwhelming evidence that the number was more on the order of 6 million.<br>  <br>  Maybe their minds just can't handle the numbers.

First we have to remember that the President and his staff were led to believe that the obtaining of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq was imminent. Our intelligence services were mistaken unfortunately, however, the President is still expected to act on the information available to him, at the time it is made available.<br>  <br>   Second, bear in mind that once you begin a military campaign it isn't like standing in line at Starbucks to get a cup of coffee, where if you change your mind you can simply step out of line. Once you commit forces to battle, aborting that operation is extremely dangerous and expensive, and places your forces at significant risk, as well as tipping off the enemy to your strategy, which of course can now no longer be used in the future.<br>  <br>  Third, fortunately for us, weapons of mass destruction were not the real reason we went to war with Iraq. WMD's were the reason we selected the "TIME" to launch an offensive against Iraq. You see, Kuwait is an ally of the United States. We have obligations to defend our allies, that's what alliances are about. Iraq had already attacked Kuwait once. To allow Iraq to do it again with weapons of mass destruction would have been catastrophic to not just the US, but many other nations as well. The benefits of maintaining alliances with other countries far outweigh the benefits of the "fortress America" doctrine which calls for a complete non engagement policy world wide by our military forces except in the case of a direct attack on our soil. We gain significant economic, political, and strategic benefits to maintaining these alliances. In fact without the alliance that was formed during WW 2, we would all likely be speaking German right now. Hence, one connection between defending our alliances and the freedom of America.<br>  <br>  The stronger an enemy nation gets the more likely they are to garner support from much larger countries that actually could do us harm. We learned that lesson during the Cuban missile crisis. Most people don't even want to know how close we came to WW 3 during that event. So, the fact that Iraq seemed to be a tiny little insignificant country that posed no threat to America is, as a matter of history, a rather unwise viewpoint, and telling of a great naivety of both world history, and geopolitical tactics and strategy.<br>  <br>  In the modern era of global economics, just about every newsworthy occurrence that affects more than one nation is highly prone to affecting the majority of the world. You see a lot of anti-war types complain about the US going to war for oil, but that tired argument is short-sighted and devoid of the full truth of the matter. The simple fact of the matter is that oil equals food. Oil equals water. Oil equals medical supplies. Oil equals transportation. Just about everything we have and use on a daily basis requires the use of oil, whether it be the fuel that it used by the ships, trains, and trucks that deliver the goods we need to survive, or the police, fire, and rescue vehicles that help provide and secure our safety. So to say that America is going to war for oil, is EXACTLY the same as America going to war for food or any of those other things. Doesn't have the same evil ring to it all of a sudden huh?<br>  <br>  Now look, if you don't mind the idea of paying 22 dollars for a loaf of bread, or 22 dollars for a gallon of milk, or having no choice but to spend 50 dollars a day on your commute to work for fuel, or paying 50% of your income to taxes to pay for police or fire service, then I suppose for a person like that, freedom isn't terribly impeded. For the vast majority of us however, any significant interruption in the supply or cost of oil will stand to impact our freedom significantly. Now does that mean we should go to war every time someone raises the price of oil a nickel. no, of course not. Iraq however, had already attacked Kuwait once of it's own volition. Any significant unrest in the region stands to disrupt the flow of oil worldwide. So as a secondary reasoning for the war in Iraq, is to ensure the stability of the flow of oil from oil producing countries like Kuwait and other places to the rest of the world so to ensure that the world economic impact was minimized.<br>  <br>  The last "significant" reason for going to war with Iraq in a manner that affects our freedom, is the fact that Saddam had used chemical weapons against his own people. Which means that he would be obviously more than capable of using them against an enemy, like for instance, Kuwait. Any impedance or interference in the safety or freedom of an ally, is just the same as if it were imposed on us. Otherwise the alliance is pointless.<br>  <br>  Now maybe one day in the near future, we will have access to technology that is cheap enough and widespread enough, that forming alliances with people over resources will become less and less of a necessity. I|`|6SwaWSoyaa	US and UK both have always had our little conflicts with the middle east. The problem though is that the few ignorant people of the countries in the middle east is controlling and dominating the government while everyone else is forced to take it.<br>  Our oil is heavily dependent on that part of the world and these few ignorant people are raised and are raising people to hate the western world. That right there is a threat to not only the US but anywhere with freedom.<br>  This war isn't just solely for the US, it is for the innocent that just happen to be caught in the middle over there, for any country with freedom, and for the world in general.<br>  <br>  Now is the war my cup of tea...no, but you have to look at both sides of the perspective instead of focusing on one.|`|N3OB7M8maa	One question:<br>  <br>  Would you rather we fight terrorists over there, or on our soil?<br>  <br>  Another question:<br>  <br>  Have you noticed that we have not had another terror strike on U.S. soil since 9/11/2001?

The treatment of ethical issues and the institutions that are supposed to be dealing with them obviously cannot keep up with technology.  The question I have is one of why these embryos are being made in a tube to begin with.  I do not perceive it as necessary.  I cannot foresee any ultimate good arising from it.<br>  <br>  It often seems like society is trying to remedy some bad choices with more bad choices.<br>  <br>  As for deciding what life is viable and of value and what life is not, people do it all the time.  These value judgements often take different forms.  Hospitals decide who should be put on life support and who should be left to die when they do not have sufficient resources to give to all their patients.  People do tend to measure the value of one human life over another through numerical criteria such as I.Q. tests and income brackets.  "Stonecutters" even exchange in human assets, treating them as commodities.  The deliberate destruction of embryos is just one more testament towards moral degradation disguised as progress as humans try to play at being gods.  I think the embryos should not have been conceived in the test tubes to begin with, but I am not sure whether anyone has a right to destroy them.|`|YupMCYHlaa	For decades now, couples who have a hard time conceiving have been going to IVF clinics--in vitro fertilization.  At these places they extract a few eggs from mom, a few sperm from dad, and get them together in a petri dish to create a few 'blastocysts'.  These are implanted in mom, one or two at a time, and some women are able to get pregnant in this way who couldn't do it in the traditional, more enjoyable way.<br>  <br>  I have never heard Christians denounce this process or complain that it is 'playing god'.  Christians love families, after all, and the kid that results is indistinguishable from one conceived in the regular way.<br>  <br>  But after Mom gets pregnant, the rest of these blastocysts are just thrown away!  And I've never heard any outrage about this either.  To Christians who believe life begins at conception, these are PEOPLE!  I just think it's strange. I'm sure tens of thousands of these little things go in the trash every year, or into medical waste incinerators.<br>  <br>  So long as these little guys are going to be destroyed anyway, what's the objection with growing a few of them a few more days, then extracting cells from them that can be of great help to people?  From that point on, the cells grow from one another, no further destruction of 'life' is necessary.|`|O5KOwhovaa	The "embryoes" were never going to become human beings anyway, so the result will be possible cures for several life-destroying and terrible medical conditions.|`|3secB3Smaa	The results will be that those embryos that would be discarded will now be used to improve human life.|`|zHQVlXd5aa	It wasn't going to be a life anyway so I don't get that argument.

We're broke!!!!!|`|557nSJb1aa	No, it is not a step toward deciding what life is viable. <br>  <br>  The result of using embryos for research will be that less embryos are thrown in the trash (the ones they will use are ones created for IVFthat the owners don't want) and that we may find a way to use such embryos to help people.|`|rIlpqCzmaa	people with spinal cord injuries might walk again

South Korea made their bed, they can sleep in it. The USA has far more important things to deal with right now.
a6fUSU2Paa	There's no such thing as a good dictator.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  The definition of dictatorship is when a leader displays absolute, imperious, or overbearing power or control. You really think that sounds good?<br>  edit:<br>  Then nobody should be calling him a dictator, as he seems far more interested in helping his people than helping himself, which by definition, is the only thing dictators worry about. Leaders such as Hitler and Stalin have been called dictators for a reason. If there were such thing as a good dictator, we would have heard of good leaders being referred to as dictators.

However, I would say that they are a VERY long way from a truly "benign" authoritarian, nationalist government. In addition, Syria is not exactly what one would use as an example of economic genius either. Don't forget the glaring fact as well, that they have selected to ally themselves with an anti-western and anti-Israel nation that also is not heralded for their grasp of human rights, Iran.<br>  <br>  So, whether the leader of Syria is respected or loved or not is largely irrelevant. What is relevant is that they have chosen to side with our political enemy, Iran. To what end, I can only assume, would be to support the interest of the destruction of Israel, but there may be other connections as well with Iran. Either way, it does not serve our interests to send praise to our enemies for any reason, deserved or not.

He gets more filled every day. Soon he'll need to be popped like a huge balloon. What a GD bag of wind!!!|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	My idea of personal fulfillment is that it is something that varies from one person to another and while you or I may not think we would find fulfillment in what another does, we are not qualified to access that which others do.  I suspect that Rush Limbaugh finds a great deal of personal fulfillment in what he does and he obviously does it very well.  It's to his good fortune that he also happens to earn a great deal of money at the same time.  I suspect, though, that Oprah Winfrey also finds a great deal of fulfillment in what she does which also makes her a lot of money and the fact that I rarely agree with anything she says or does doesn't diminish the fulfillment she probably receives from her efforts nor does it detract from my respect of her right to pursue her dream.  The same is true with Limbaugh.  But, I have a question for you.  Is it of equal concern to you that she is as much to the political left as Limbaugh is to the political right?  I mean, why not ask the same question pertaining to one with whom you are politically aligned?

The doctors here were suffering from no such liability (and if they were, they should not have been working) and yet they still failed to perform their job (which they are paid handsomely to do) adequately, and as a result of their slip-up, a guy who was already burdened with a mental illness now has a physical handicap to deal with.<br>  <br>  It doesn't seem fair, but where do you draw the line in this sort of circumstance?  What if the patient was undergoing surgery for heart disease that resulted from a life of poor eating habits, and the surgery did save his life, but had similarly debilitating outcome because of a similar negligent error at the hands of the hospital personnel?<br>  <br>  Should we no longer hold doctors responsible for any mistakes they might make, as long as the patient was (at least partially) responsible for the problem that put him in the hospital, and as long as the patient doesn't actually die?<br>  <br>  Medical and legal ethics have more nuances than might be apparent at first glance.|`|ZgkMNG8qaa	There appears to be negligence on the part of the doctors in subscribing him too much of the neutralising drug.

Fine, we wont!!!<br>  <br>  I know a lot of doctors and nurses who are starting to question our own morality and questioning if we should even bother treating some people! Why should we put our careers at risk? <br>  <br>  But parasites like this man keep bleeding the NHS dry.

Klp0Mv6kaa	One thing you have to understand is that there is a hell of a distance between "I can′t win" and "I can′t attack".<br>  Example.Had Japan any hope to win a war on the USA?No.Does it mean that Japan could not ATTACK USA?No,it COULD attack.And it attacked.<br>  The same question;could Hitler′s Germany even hope to win a war against the Soviet Union in 1941,especially with Britain and USA being the Russian allies? Not even in a dream.But to attack-yes,it could.And it attacked.<br>  Iran can not win in the war against the USA(the European armies today can hardly be taken seriously).But it CAN attack,and kill dozens of thousands of Americans,and after that-who knows?If even now,after the 9/11,there are people in the USA who quite seriously say that islam is the religion of peace,and that hitting back on a country the attack came from means to punish many for the crimes of the few-then,Iran has all the reasons to think that it can hit Europe and USA with nukes-and not to be annihilated in return.<br>  What is the modern concept of humanism?It′s when we are invited to value the lives of the enemies more than the lives of our own people.And what is astounding:quite a lot of us agree.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	I think this is an excellent question.  These nations have expended considerable resources to move towards nuclear capability yet, as you point out, such capability would not avail them against the US or its allies.

They know that we will give a lot to make them stop.<br>  <br>  2.  Craziness.  Ahmadinejad really believes that Israel could be removed if Iran had a nuclear strike capability.

The US is known for always helping others out, giving, and the negative side: always putting our nose into other people's business. This is where all the stupid american stereotypes kick into play.<br>  Now to my point: I don't understand why we are always giving when we obviously have so many problems to work on ourselves. I don't think we can help too much when we need help ourselves. Our economy is in the dumps and honestly when our economy goes down, it seems like everyone else's economy comes down with it sooner or later. There are people on our own turf who desperately needs help but it is overlooked because we are trying to fight a war of almost nothingness anymore. <br>  I like that America has the quality of always wanting to help others but in the same sense I think we just need to help ourselves before we continue. I think most people see that, and they are outspoken about it, that is where the arrogant and selfish stereotypes come in then, because some people can't see that we are trying to better ourselves to help them.<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  I know I've repeated myself and I am sort of off topic, but I just wanted to throw this in.<br>  Have a good day.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	To whom in Gaza?

History is repeating itself with Gaza. <br>  <br>  An example from our daily life about israel's actions: they hit and run.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that Saudi Arabia paid $5.25millions to each 9/11 victim in America, just because the aggressors had a Saudi nationality.<br>  <br>  So it is rational that America pays to Gaza, since America publicly supplied israel with war weapons,bombs & machines during the war.|`|FQn5A2nuaa	My friend it is all a game.

And the government is right too. American money, along with money from a few other countries, was sent to Israel for self defense, yet the IDF sees it necessary to take their self defense measures to the extreme.<br>  <br>  After that, the government should feel obliged to send money to rebuild the Gaza Strip. So long as all of it is going to reconstruction, and not into Hamas's pockets.

This is both Internationally and Constitutionally written. <br>  <br>  Libel:<br>  <br>  In law, defamation (also called calumny, libel, slander, and vilification) is the communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual, business, product, group, government or nation a negative image. <br>  <br>  Slander refers to a malicious, false and defamatory spoken statement or report, while libel refers to any other form of communication such as written words or images. <br>  <br>  Most jurisdictions allow legal actions, civil and/or criminal, to deter various kinds of defamation and retaliate against groundless criticism.<br>  <br>  Many nations have criminal penalties for defamation in some situations, and different conditions for determining whether an offense has occurred. <br>  <br>  In Britain, the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta was convicted of criminal libel for denouncing the Italian state agent Ennio Belelli in 1912.<br>  <br>  In Canada, the law has been applied on only six occasions in the past century, and all of those cases involve libellants attached to the state (police officers, judges, prison guards).

Obama will make the world a safer place. <br>  (I always get suspicious whenever someone starts by saying it's not about race but...).|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	>>>  Yes , ***  But what about a fair prosecution  of  the previous ***administration leaders who became very wealthy after they have placing the US under the pressure of The racist Zionist lobby to  lead the country to   recession, by direct and indirect  involvement in fabricated wars against Qaeda and Taliban in Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran, Hamas in Palestine ,Hezbollah in Lebanon ,and Sudan... etc.|`|mno4Qd5paa	Once upon a time, there was a charismatic and eloquent young leader who decided his nation needed a change, and he was the one to implement it.<br>  <br>  The people were receptive and ready for a change. He spoke passionately when denouncing the existing system, and the press loved him.<br>  <br>  Nobody questioned what he believed in or who his friends were. He would help the poor and bring free medical care and education to all. He would bring justice and equality.<br>  <br>  He said,'I am for hope and change, and will bring you both.' Nobody bothered to ask about the change, so by the time the executioner's guns went silent, all guns had been confiscated.<br>  <br>  When everyone was finally equal, they were equally poor, hungry, and miserable. Their free education was worthless. When the change was fully implemented, the country had been reduced to Third World status.<br>  <br>  More than a million people fled in small boats and rafts.<br>  <br>  The charismatic young leader was Fidel Castro; the nation, Cuba .<br>  <br>  The citizens of the United States would never fall for a charismatic, eloquent young leader who promises hope and change without asking,'What change, and how much will it cost us?|`|cIttXzrwaa	It was Mr. Bush (as you call him) with his deregulation that got us into this financial trouble in the first place.  And in my opinion you are mistaken.  But of course, I would defend your right to your opinion.|`|SbH5c7jdaa	you are completely and utterly mistaken. This country has been going downhill for a long time,and it will take a long time to fix it.|`|GF8VLkxDaa	It's capitalism tbh, i wouldn't be surpirsed if they took the islamic way of mangement and the economy:P<br>  <br>  It's a much better method|`|O5KOwhovaa	You are mistaken about everything.|`|aVXsqdLpaa	Give him time.  Bush got eight years to ruin the country.  Let Obama have at least four years to fix it.|`|AA11571284	You are NOT mistaken.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	not mistaken|`|Otrwsauiaa	Let’s see:<br>  <br>  The Bush record for morality and economy –<br>  When he first took over [hijacked] the office of president he was dubbed THE LAME DUCK PRESIDENT; he also gave all taxpayers a rebate of $300 [you may even recall getting yours if you were a working American]; PRIOR TO THAT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAD THE COUNTRY WITH A BALANCED BUDGET!!!<br>  He also promised a substantial rebate [$70,000 I believe] to folks who bought SUVs [those GAS guzzling autos that everybody and their grandmothers rushed out to buy] <br>  -which seemed to open the flood gates for soaring gas prices at the pump – it wasn’t so long ago that prices were near or at $5.00 a gallon!  Does any of this ring a bell?<br>  -started an immoral war for the purposes of lining the pockets of his and his father’s cronies at HALIBURTON,  LOCKHEED MARTIN, THE CARLYLE GROUP – defense contractors that made/make money from the casualties of war – those young adults [BODIES] and fellow Americans on the front lines.<br>  And what’s ironic is that the Carlyle group is actually a cartel that links the BEN LADENs and the BUSHs who are actually family friends IN THE OIL BUSINESS. So, EXACTLY what has this war been really about?<br>  As for the abortion issue – his LEAVE NO CHILD BEHIND slogan was just that. It was an empty promise.<br>  The abortion issue that is mostly in question is the parts that deals with 1-risking the mother’s life in order to bring the child into this world without a mother – [and possibly placed in an institution where no doubt the child will be unprotected from immoral predators is insane – but that’s another show.] 2-when a child is conceived as a result of cases of rape/incest. <br>  <br>  On top of that BUSH was an idiot – he even said so in his last speech as president [its probably on YOUTUBE so you can see it again if you want]. Many of his press conferences were filled with so many foot-in-mouth missteps that he should have been the KING OF MALAPROPS instead of your president!<br>  <br>  Another example of his ineptness: THE WEEK BEFORE THE 911 ATTACKS THE LEADING STORY WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BUMPED HIS HEAD ON A BOTTLE OF BEER WHILE WATCHING TV.  And the month prior to that he had received a national security report alerting him that there was a plot being planned for an attack on this country very soon – AND HE DIDN’T READ IT!  His secretary of state, RICE had to inform his staff that their reports should be kept to a minimum b/c he’s not a big reader.  He’s been the MOST absent president in the history of this country [literally AND figuratively!  And more recently back in September 2008 when the economic crisis began to unravel – how long was the report he [wrote] uhhhhhhhhh THREE PAGES, right?  And uhhh how long was the subsequent report that was an amendment to the original 3-page work: OVER ONE HUNDRED PAGES?  <br>  I could actually go on – but it would take up too much space….<br>  <br>  THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO…UMMMMMMMMMM?<br>  <br>  In any event, as for your statement “alot of my black friends,” it seems to me that you do see them differently. b/c they are not your FRIENDS they are your BLACK FRIENDS. So clearly, you also see OBAMA differently.  so since you are looking at him differently PLEASE NOTE:  HE WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR WHICH THE COUNTRY IS NOW EXPERIENCING. In terms of his “destroying what little morals we have left,”  do you think that making health insurance affordable for all people immoral? How about his expeditious strategy to close GITMO within the next several months – the place well-known for torturing its inmates? Or even being in the process of creating GREEN JOBS TO PROTECT THE PLANET…ARE THESE THINGS IMMORAL to you?<br>  <br>  I certainly understand that everyone is entitled to their opinion – clearly, I’m happy about that ;) but, instead of being petty…choose to be still, listen and look at the changes [both good and bad] that will inevitably take place during this administration’s residence.  No man/woman is perfect – not even YOU! <br>  <br>  BE PART OF THE SOLUTION: Stay interested in your government, volunteer for your representative, get involved. But this is NOT a time for divisiveness – we need each other – ALL HANDS ON DECK…NOW!|`|Vjb9qXZfaa	What are you gonna do about it?<br>  Impeach him?<br>  Give it a try, don't know if it will work though. (:|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	Yes, you are mistaken.  It is the end of the capitalistic era and Obama is taking the USA in the lead to a new and improved super power.  This will not happen overnight and there are going to be a lot of rough spots.  But the USA will be a better country in the end.<br>  <br>  Edited:  Lol.  Three thumbs down.  They must be from anti-americans who truly want to see the USA fall.  Shame on you three.
Klp0Mv6kaa	It is true.<br>  The government of Morocco on Friday decided to cut its ties with Iran, accusing Tehran of trying to foment a Shiite Muslim rebellion in the north African Sunni kingdom. In a statement, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry said that Iran "is trying to alter the religious fundamentals of the kingdom, an intolerable interference in the internal affairs of the kingdom."<br>  <br>  Officially, there are no Shi'ites in the country; Morocco is 99% Sunni Muslim, with the other 1% of the population either Jewish or Christian. But Rabat has repeatedly accused Iran of proselyting among its citizens. In a statement yesterday, Iran's Foreign Ministry said it was "astonished by the move," emphasizing that "the allegations regarding the interference (of Iran) in Morocco's internal affairs are totally baseless and wrong. <br>  <br>  I hav already learned certain law:if Iran fiercely denies something-then,this "something" is true.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Here is a link supporting your statement.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090306/ap_on_re_af/af_morocco_iran_4">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090306/ap_o...</a>|`|u4liwDhAaa	I raise my glass to Morocco!

uKrdjrJiaa	*Please delete this answer when you imagine I will be sober*<br>  Having grown up in a republican area of Belfast I can assure you that the terrorism never left Belfast.The IRA And PIRA continue to 'police' NI  be it right or wrong.Personally I feel that while many citizens of NI continue to distrust  the police force and the British army this wil continue-it is easier for some people to blame the problems of a community on the ''occupation of the British'' than it is  to see what is going on beneath their own noses!|`|fLMCOSWdaa	The history of the IRA has since the C19th been one of the majority groups going legit, and a few die hards carrying on the armed campaign.  So, the first President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera had been an IRA commander.  So was Jack Lynch.  The Official IRA became the Workers Party under Cathal Goulding and laid down their arms.  The Provisionals, in the North, refused to.  Check out the Stevie Hayes affair, by the way, if you wish to discover the depths of internal feuding.  Adams et al have gone legit, but there will still be dissidents. Enniskillen was the work of (still uncaptured) dissidents. By the way, those of you who write 'hang them all' need to read a bit of history.  The English were 'hanging them all' from about 1170 through to 1829 and the Emancipation of Catholics Bill, and beyond, but it did not work. Peace usually comes from economic prosperity and stopping people studying history.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	I hope the incident isn't IRA related.
