20090202135219AA6XEQ6	Travel;United States;Washington, D.C.	Short cut from Silver Spring to Bethesda?	I'm moving to Downtown Silver Spring MD in a few weeks. I work in Germantown and will have to commute there from Silver Spring in the morning.      I've heard terrible horror stories about I-495 which was my original plan for commuting. I want to avoid I-495 if its really the "parking lot" everyone claims it to be at rush hour.      So I'm thinking I can leave Silver Spring and take a back road to Bethesda, then catch I-270 right after the I-495 / I-270 intersection of heIl. I-270 should be a smooth ride to Germantown.      Is this a good plan? What's the fastest route to Bethesda from Silver Spring without using I-495?      Thanks.

I am looking forward to the process of entering college after high school graduation. However, my lifetime goals of helping others and seeing the world are very important as well.   Has anyone tried the "gap year"--where you take a year off to travel, volunteer, etc.--either before or during college?   Would you recommend a certain time, such as a gap year between high school and college, versus a gap year in the middle of college?   Was it worth it? Any good options? I like the sound of the Peace Corps, but would that be better for after college?   Most importantly--can I apply to colleges during high school (the normal time) but have my acceptances deferred a year??

To avoid be scammed, I was advised to ..?	check the IP addresses of her emails to see if they were coming from the Internet cafe in Sernur she claimed to use. If not, I was told, she was likely a scammer. I checked and indeed the IP addresses all traced back to a city fifty miles away from Sernur called Yoshkar ola. My question is this: How specific is an IP address? Could the last IP address shown in the header of her emails from the Internet cafe in Sernur, show as originating from Yoshkar ola? Or is she really emailing me from Yoshkar ola and in fact lying. An IP address from one of her emails is 91.144.161.143.      Thank you for you assistance,      Sincerely,      Todd W.

Hi,    I'm considering flying for the first time this year, I've been scared of it all my life, but I've met someone from America and I'd really love to visit them,(I'm in the UK)    When I've spoken to people, they tell me to try a short flight first, but my problem is if I'll be brave enough to get on a plane in the first place.And to be honest the only place I want to visit is the USA.    I've seen fear of flying courses advertised on the web, but they cost nearly as much as a ticket.    I guess that most of you have flown before, so please give me some help.    Is flying really as scary I think it will be?    Thanks

I've been to HK Intl Airport a few times but never had to plan a close connection between international flights before.    I'm flying from Shanghai to HK on Shanghai Air, to connect to a Thai Air to Bangkok. The Thai Air flight is already set for 8:40 PM flight, and I'm trying to figure out how much time I need to connect.     There's a Shanghai Air flight arriving to HK Intl at 5:40pm, and one at 7:35pm.  (Also a China Eastern arriving at 6:45pm, but i won't get FF miles for that)   Shanghai Air and Thai Air are both in Terminal W1, according to the HK Airport website.     Is the 7:35pm arrival on Shanghai Air cutting it too close for an 8:40 departure on Thai Air if I only have carry on?   (And in any case: If I only have carryon luggage, will I need to go out of the security area?     If I can stay inside the W1 security area, Is it possible for me to get my boarding pass to my connecting Thai Air flight at the gate?)    Thanks in advance to all you HK savvy fliers.
