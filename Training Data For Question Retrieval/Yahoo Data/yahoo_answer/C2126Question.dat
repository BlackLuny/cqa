For the last couple of days I haven't been able to open any part of my email after i get to the main page. Instead of loading being done on the status bar at the bottom of the screen I get the word 'loading' appearing in blue at the top of the page, in the middle (actually inside the yahoo page) and then nothing happening when it says 'done' at the bottom. What's going on? I haven't changed any settings or anything so no idea what to do. I can open pages if I choose 'open in a new tab/link' but I can't compose emails or reply. Every other web page works as normal. Please help if you can.      thanks

20090310050500AAVDArU	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Who would you most get annoyed with?	1.  somebody who sees the world as good and happy and can only be friends with those kind of people, or people who are mostly "good"(behavior wise)...but when confrontation sparks with someone a bit more worldly and normal, they get offensive and say things like, "shut up" because they have no understanding of conflict and they'd rather stay in their cozy bubble, and they tend to tell personal stories about their pets that no one would ever want to hear      2.  Somebody who has great confidence in their humor, but they are completely insensitive to all others and make fun of practically everyone they meet, even their own friends, who do the same.      3.  A superficial "plastic" who is concerned only with partying, shopping, and being seen with the popular crowd      4.  An intense religious person who will scold you      5.  somebody who doesn't talk at all      6.  teacher's pet

The blood of the other person came in contact with my open wounds on my knuckles. I wiped the blood off of my knuckles with a cloth and as soon as I got home (approx 15minutes after the blood came in contact with my open wound) I washed my knuckles and applied some alcohol on it.       I do not know if the other person had any sort of disease. Please give me your advice.

20090309105444AA9KpPQ	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Calling all smart people... How would you go about doing this...?	Human Resource Management: Theory and Practice:      The role of HRM and relative importance of many of the activities associated with HRM have changed as organisations endeavour to successfully compete in competitive and dynamic markets. Recruitment and Selection activities are seen as a priority as organisations seek to attract and retain people of the right calibre.  Using this concept write a report to the managing director of an organisation with which you are familiar critiquing recruitment and selection activities.  You are required to make recommendations and refer to the part people play in achieving and sustaining a competitive advantage.         Using an organisation with which you are familiar critically review  ‘Recruitment and Selection in [chosen organisation]: Relevance and appropriateness’      In doing so, your report should focus on the following:      1. Describe how the HRM function can add value to the organisation by aligning HR processes to the overall business strategy ( particular reference to Recruitment and Selection processes)   2. Describe and critically evaluate recruitment and selection processes.   3. Assess relevance within your chosen organisation.   4. Explain how recruitment and selection is linked with other elements of HRM, i.e. induction, training, pay and psychological contract.
