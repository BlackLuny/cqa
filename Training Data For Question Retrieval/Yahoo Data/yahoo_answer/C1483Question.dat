Hi Folks,      In English, we call a boat or ship "she"   We do not apply gender all the time.      "It is a table"      In most languages, there is a gender difference before the noun.   French is famous for it      For example, when living in the Mid-East, I was careful in learning Arabic, as many items are male or female.      They say learning English is tricky, and I suppose it is, but we don't usually have this Le La, halich, halick, etc malarky !      Any notions ?      Bob

20090223031449AAXZh9c	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I have something I am just confused about :S?	Well, I am in high school at the moment so I would kind of expect these kind of things to happen but this is a situation I am just not sure about.      There are these group of kids they hang around each other as a gang, but I do not know if they are gay or bi or anything or if they're just playing around or something.      For a start, all of them have myspace. well one of the kids has a topless photo of himself on MySpace right? Well this other kid has a photo of himself standing on his bed with his briefs on but shirt on. And on MySpace they keep calling each other sexy k*nts and calling each other sexy.      Anyway, at school it is different. They all call each other sexy and it's just surprising to see kids like that. In our Humanities class, one of them sat next to me and was leaning on me and I ignored him. He also was touching my hair and I find that a bit weird.       Oh and it gets worse. At PE, we have to change into our PE uniform right? I go in the cubicles and the kids do. But 3 of the kids get changed near each other in the corner regardless of them being aware of their own privacy when taking their pants off. At one stage, one of them was running around with his pants off.      Also the kid that sat next to me was touching this boy's hair and saying it's soft as and kept touching and feeling it.      They are also hugging each other and that's what they are doing.      To be honest, the kids at school don't usually do this stuff. So my question is:      Are they gay or bisexual or something? If not, what must they be up to?

20090223034457AAeiTQ5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking:  Why are you angry at the truth about God?	I do understand the anger in reponse to the previous question, because it proves that you do not understand the Word comes from God, we as messengers of God only deliver,  so how could you not believe in God and His Word, when y ou don't understand that it is foolish not to believe?  Fool= A person who lacks a sense or judgement.  There is no argument because you believe what you will.  The Word (God) also states that those who have an ear let him hear what thus saith the Lord.  again no offense intended.  God loves you, but there are still consequences for your non belief if there is no change of heart/repentance. I can't condemn you, because you condemn yourselves when you don't believe.

There was a guy who seemed to be very frustrated with women by the way he was talking about them. For instance he was making negative comments about a lady who got married three times. Also, he had a son, a very young child, and he was even making very negative comments about him. Additionaly, he thought getting druink was very cool, and that it was a symbol of maturity, he also thought it was cool to kiss his friends partners and then do all sorts of imature behaviors.      I think that you cannot expect anything good with someone like this, right?

20061225133728AAD8lBO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	La iglesia hizo la BIBLIA?	Isaias 55:10-11 "Porque como desciende de los cielos la lluvia y la nieve, y no vuelve alla, sino que riega la tierra, y la hace germinar y producir, y da semilla al que la siembra, y pan al que come, asi sera mi palabra que sale de mi boca; no volvera a mi vacia, sino que hara lo que yo quiero, y sera prosperada en aquello para que la envie."      LA NATURALEZA DE LA PALABRA DE DIOS.  La frase "la Palabra de Dios" o "la Palabra de Jehova" o simplemente "la Palabra" se refiere a una diversidad de cosas en las Escrituras.   1. Es evidente que se refiere ante todo a cualquier cosa que Dios jaiga dicho directamente.  Cuando Dios les hablo a Adan y a Eva lo que El dijo era la Palabra de Dios.  De una manera parecida, Dios le comunico Su Palabra a Abraham, a Jacon y a Moises. Tambien Dios le hablo a toda la nacion de Israel en el monte de Sinai cuando promulgo los Diez Mandamientos; las palabras que ellos oyeron eran sus palabras.      La Biblia la escribio Dios por medio de personas que El uso.

If you care what the Bible says... in Genesis chapter 4 (4:17) it refers to Abel and his wife, and also to Eve. Eve was not his wife, and he did not have children with her.    There were other people on the Earth after Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and there was no inbreeding according to the Bible account.      If you want to make fun... go ahead, but I just wanted to clear up a legitimate question that no one had the answer to on that prior question.

20070113203216AAvTsiD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Los cristianos tienen un  lavado de cerebro?	Dios es tan bueno, su amor incomparable, su misericordia infinita, su justicia perfecta. Quiero que Dios sea cada vez mas grande en mi vida, que el sea quien gobierne mi vida entera. Que Dios tome el control de mi mente. Quiero tener una comunion permanente con Dios.Que la presencia de Dios sea lo mas fuerte en mi vida..    Antes de ser cristiano yo no queria buscar de Dios porque queria hacer lo que se me antojaba y me inventaba buenos pretextos para salirme con la mia, y muchas veces lo que queria era pecar, desobedecer a dios.Que bueno que ahora eso esta cambiando , aunque aveces he desobedecido a Dios, entonces voy a Dios, me arrepiento y le pido perdon , y Dios con su infinita misericordia me perdona. La biblia dice que las misericordias de Dios son nuevas cada manana, y que si  le pides perdon , el toma tus pecados y los hecha al fondo de la mar para nunca mas acordarse de ellos.   Antes estaba llena de basura mi mente, habia mucho orgullo, mentiras, envidia, fantasias sexuales, celos, resentimiento y otras mugres mas, ahora Dios esta limpiando, lavando mi mente.    Algunos me han dicho : “ te han lavando el cerebro” y yo les digo: si es verdad , porque lo tenia muy sucio. Todavia dios esta limpiando mi mente, es un proceso que va a durar mucho tiempo, pero mi cabeza ya esta mucho mas limpia y ordenada que antes.Dios es experto en limpiar mentes y corazones, en curar heridas, en restaurar vidas, en consolar y traer paz mental, en hacer  de lo que no sirve algo que sirva.El Senor hace nuevas todas las cosas.Solamente debemos dejar que Dios nos cambie nos moldee a la manera de el . En mis oraciones digo: Jesus que se haga tu voluntad y no la mia.    Siento ganas de decir que ser cristiano es la cosa mas linda que me ha pasado en mi vida   Mas que preguntar senti ganas de decir esto, si deseas por supuesto que  puedes opinar sobre esto  .

No comprendo al Papa, dentro de las filas del clero hay un sin fin de curas homo y esos hombres tienen su fe inquebrantable en Dios, o la sexualidad cualquiera que sea en sus formas  es Dios?, sabemos bien que no es así. Jesus de Nazareth fue un Dios que trajo la palabra Amor,para la humanidad ?se olvido el Papa de ella?

I am currently working full-time as a clerk. I saved some money myself and I enrol in a DJing short course in a musical school. Because I really wanna try DJing. Well, DJing in Clubs/pubs. I wanna to be a part-time DJ. However, my 51-year-old mum say I've made a stupid mistake. She said , " The club DJ working environment is too bad. You can find drugs, prostitute, pimp and manwh0re there. it shows that You don't love yourself since you wanna  learn DJing. Someone in pub will put drugs into your pocket and you'll be prosecuted. " I learn it because I am interested" I said. " I will only be offered jobs if my DJing skills is up to a certain level. And it takes at least 1 year to reach to that  level. " However, my mum said "You lack critical thinking since you enrol in that stupid DJing course. You can't earn much money for DJing. Loser! " Then she started to throw books at me. I said "End of discussion. mum . Please calm down first! " My mum said , " You can learn German, French, cocktail-making . But you are not allowed to learn DJing. You need to learn something which can make you rich, to earn money. "       Finally I surrender, "Fine! For the sake of our mother-son relationship. I am going to cancel my DJing course. " Then my mum said " This won't make our relationship better ,son. Because our relationship is always good. " Then she said , " I hae helped you to save the DJing course fee, now. You should thank me."       My mum is also a homophobic person as well. I dare not to declare my homosexuality in front of her. I am afraid she will throw things at me again if I come out.      She says only mentally retarded people go to learn DJing. I am so angry. She still keeps saying this after I cancel the DJing course. How do you think of her?

20090223040836AA0SwpW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I'm gay, just come out of the closet, but DEEPLY regrets it.?	Please don't use answers like: "if they're your true friends, they'll understand" <-- too vague.      Well, I just come out of the closet in front of two of my homophobic friends. One of them kinda freaked out until his hands were trembling. I was like "oh ****". then he told me that "ignorance is bliss". But after a few while he stabilized and told me its still okay but he needs time. My other 7 friends already knew about this a long time ago.       Do you really think "ignorance is bliss" cause it happens that he's afraid of homosexuality as much as he's afraid of cockroach. Its just quite scary to see someone you've been trusting and hanging out for like 6 years come to a sense that he actually trembled and his face turned pale. Do you really think I should just keep it confidential? Because I kinda regret telling him.
20090223040834AA3v7sV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What exactly does God do?	If God allows babies to die or be born with deformities.   And also lets man kill millions of his fellow men with impunity why should we worship such an uncaring Deity?   It really does not make any sense.   Prayer will never stop wars or ethnic cleansing,heal bodies or make famine go away.   So what is the point of religion?   I agree with the religious concept of not harming your fellow man but religion has killed more people than any single conflict.   It seem to me that it is all down to (if you don't worship the way I do I will kill you) So what is the point of worshipping someone(thing)   who does not care?
20090223040208AAwdWXu	Society & Culture;Languages	Can you help me with this text in english?	Sydney, the state capital of New South Wales, is the biggest and oldest city of Australia.       In this city, there are a lot of activities to do, like doing sports or go sightseeing. You can do sports like cricket, tennis or football, in the sports centres of the city; if you like outdoor sports you can go to the beaches and play volleyball or go surfing. If you like a sightseeing holidays you have some monuments to visit.     One of the monuments that you must visit is the Sydney opera house, this building was built in 1973 and it is one of the world's most distinctive 20th century buildings.     Another famous building is the Sydney tower, if you go up you    can see all the city and the suburbs. So, usually there are a lot of  people waiting to go up.    If you like animals, you can go also to the Taronga zoo, there you can see animals from Australia like platypus,  koala or kangaroo        After a marvellous day you can go dinner to Fish Face Restaurant, this restaurant is in the centre of the city and offers a typical Australian food.     But, Sydney has too negative thinks, like, that all the summers it is in danger for the fires, they started in the national parks.         Despite, the pollution and fires I think that is a beautiful city to visit, so I expect going to Sydney like a millions of tourist.

Do you not all understand the irony of this, according to your religion god sent rainbows to show that he would never flood the earth again like a promise.       So each time you see a rainbow do you think, "Oh thanks god for not flooding the earth... but only a small part of it."      You could practically say the same for explosive weapons, "Oh thanks Pakistan for not blowing up the entire earth... but only a small part of it."      I'm just saying...

I have recently been watching some paranormal videos and reading some information, and I have come to find out that along with electro-magnetic readings, temperature is used to "detect" ghosts. I was wondering if anybody thinks that maybe if ghosts are real, it is somehow an endothermic reaction, some kind of manifestation of electricity, magnetism, and heat that takes energy from the environment. Somehow the soul or whatever makes this endothermic reaction. I dunno just a thought.

20080702180328AARWY23	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Un estudio alerta del descenso en la población de pingüinos?	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - La población de pingüinos ha disminuido bruscamente en una colonia de cría clave en Argentina, reflejando el descenso en el número de muchas especies de estas aves debido al cambio climático, la contaminación y otros factores, según un estudio.      Dee Boersma, profesora de la Universidad de Washington y que dirigió la investigación, explicó que la difícil situación de los pingüinos es un indicador de los grandes cambios producidos en los océanos del mundo por la actividad humana.      "Los pingüinos están en problemas", dijo el martes Boersma en una entrevista telefónica.      "Definitivamente son canarios en una mina de carbón", agregó la experta, cuyo estudio aparece en la revista BioScience.      Durante los últimos 25 a?os, Boersma ha seguido la pista de la colonia de cría de pingüinos de Magallanes más grande del mundo, situada en Punta Tombo, en la costa atlántica de Argentina.      Desde 1987, se?aló, la zona ha registrado una reducción del 22 por ciento en la población de estos pingüinos; un descenso, a?adió, que parecía haber comenzado a comienzos de los 80 después de que la población local llegara a un máximo de unas 400.000 parejas de pingüinos entre finales de los 60 y mediados de los 70.      El total de hoy es la mitad de ese número.      El cada vez más cálido clima mundial es sólo uno de los problemas de los pingüinos, a?adió. Estos animales también están amenazados por la contaminación, el agotamiento de la pesca, el riesgo de quedar atrapados en redes de pesca, y el desarrollo costero que elimina los hábitat para criar.      "Los pingüinos son centinelas del medio ambiente marino, y al observarlos y estudiarlos los investigadores pueden aprender sobre el ritmo y la naturaleza de los cambios que están ocurriendo en los océanos sure?os", escribió la investigadora en el estudio.      "Como muestras del océano, los pingüinos ofrecen datos para comprender los patrones de la productividad regional del océano y la variación climática a largo plazo".      La mayoría de los científicos reconocen 17 especies de pingüinos, todas ellas en el hemisferio sur. Los pingüinos se adaptan muy bien a la vida en el océano, residiendo en lugares tan distintos entre sí como las islas Galápagos y la Antártida.

It just seems that since the dawn of time, that humans have lived for their pleasures, they want the best life possible and they all want to be happy. Does hedonism have to be something that's completely bad?

20090223004112AAspTUs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who are the other sheep Jesus pertains to in this verse? John 10:16?	Jesus told that he has other sheep which are not of those who are with him in Jerusalem, who are those other sheep? Some says it is the gentiles but Jesus told in Matthew 15:24 that he was not sent but for the lost sheep of israel, therefore it should be the Jews because they were God's covenant people and I believe the gentiles never heard the voice of Jesus, they may hear his teachings through his disciples but not of his own voice. He clearly said that those other sheep will hear his voice not hear his teaching, who really were those other ship whom he showed himself after saying that line?

20090223003847AAguXIl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Protestants, If I say you people are limiting God's identity to a lower degree like Muslims do, can you deny..?	We believe that God is omnipotent, full of love and nothing is impossible for him. But you claim that he does not accept prayers for departed spirits; he does not like us to submit prayers through saints; he does not like us honoring and remembering saints and he does not like us to baptize children to unite them with Jesus! Isn't it like Muslims claiming that God can not become a man and Jesus can not be crucified?       While the truth is, everything done with true faith and love are accepted by God and apart from love, nothing can influence God. No true human being can desist himself from praying for his loved ones who have departed from this world. Since he does not know their after death state, how can he deny his urge to pray for them? Is God so selfish to turn his face away for such sincere prayers made out of love? I recommend you to use your common sense a little.
20090223040356AAU0yb2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do U believe BOTH, "Evolution AND Creation"?	If so...    Is it because you find it so hard to imagine that God created everything in six 24 hr. days???      Marvin Al Lubenow,   author of, "Bones of Contention"    stated this:      "The Real issue in the "evolution/creation" debate is NOT   the "EXISTENCE" of God.    The real issue is    the "NATURE" of God.      To think of "evolution" as basically "atheistic"    is to misunderstand the uniqueness of evolution.       Evolution was not designed as a general attack against theism.    It was designed against a specific attack against the God of the Bible;    and the God of the bible is clearly revealed through the doctrine of creation.       "Evolution" is as comfortable with "theism" as it is with "atheism".       An Evolutionist is perfectly free to choose any god as he wishes, so long... as it's not the God of the Bible."

A friend the other night told me something so horrible I wanted to kill myself at the thought.   The words they used made me sick... never before in my life have words hurt me before. But this she knew was the one thing that could hurt me and she choose her words well...       Now she has fought and fought with me to destroy a promise I made to someone. CJU, saying that it was destroying her life... Although I care about everyone, I looked at the words she had said and wanted to make sure I did everything my way.    Now... that seems mean I know, but over the months I've been without my certain someone I've realised something. No matter what happens in my life, no matter who comes and goes, no matter if he's gone and we spilt down different tracks of life.   I have one thing I'm holding onto... CJU   And no matter where I am... I will always be his... his own... whether he wants me or not I don't care. But once I was his, and forever I shall be... I don't want anyone else, I'll only see him through them... and I don't want that.       Now... why is it anyone's business the promises I keep, even to myself... Why do others have to intrude...   If I choice to never kiss, touch or look at another guy or human being again and if the person I'm waiting for does want me, I'm all his... so is it that big a deal that it can destroy lives or even anything but my business...      ps. I'm not asking this person I'm waiting for, for anything... I'm simply waiting, if they want me. I'm here... if they don't then their life goes on and I sit in the shadows... Its my choice...

20090223030424AAPrXY8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Those who think science has explained the "how" must also think that chance explains something?	All scientific formulas contain random variables that we might call chance or coincidence or statistics or probability or a wave function.  These random variables give the appearance of knowledge but they are really admissions of a lack of knowledge.  Tracing cause and effect backward soon ends in a total lack of knowledge, a condition that science formulates as "it happened by chance."   When science says, "it happened by chance", does that say to you, "God isn't involved?"

And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

First of all, lets join the world in paying tribute to the victims of the forest fires in Victoria.   Im not an Australian, but I do feel the pain you all have been going through.   May their passing be a lesson learnt for us, to never take the power of nature for granted.    http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2009/02...       The fires have taken lives of at least 209 individuals and innumerable wildlife animals and destroyed thousands of homes.   It is suspected that the fire started with an arsonist or intense heat wave.   Whatever it is, what is most important right now is for all Australians to pick themselves up and rebuild the cities and lives of the survivors.   Thus it is very heartening to view how those who attended the national memorial service had the moral courage to look to the future, beyond all the sufferings.      My question is:   WHAT CAN WE DO TO HONOR THE PASSING OF ALL THE VICTIMS?      I hope it wont only be in form of financial or medical help, as these last only in short run.   What is far more important is how to ensure that this incident will be the last to ever occur on Australian land, and hopefully even the whole world.   How can we all do our parts to prevent any forest fire in the future?   How can we make sure that we know what to do to help ourselves and our community in event of such fires?   How can we smoothen the rescue process in the aftermath of such events?   These are important questions we need to ask of ourselves.   To honour the sacrifices of the fallen Australians.   Let us ensure that their passing will NOT be in vain.      Please be respectful in your comments.      God bless the victims and people of Australia.      Regards   lightofwadowice

It was news to me when i heard people calling them or guys who wear short shorts 'gay' - it was kind of silly, I guess. I'm not a fan of really short shorts - just above the knee is fine. Anyway, short shorts used to be the norm until the 80s for both men and women, now in the US, Australia it seems only acceptable for women. I think it's related to the unfashionableness of body hair, but also a fear men will be made out as more sexual beings, largely by those who are homophobic. Also hip hop fashion of course. I guess I'm glad I don't see any balls hanging out, but I'm not wearing 'shorts' that are more like 3/4 pants! lol...Women are more sexualised today largely because they wear skimpier clothes, compared to ancient Rome or something where it was the other way around. Anyway, I don't understand the relation to homosexuality. Is it because a lot of gay men in America wore/wear them?

20090223001035AAFwaXD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why did my lesbian girlfriend need to desperately relate to me this way?	I have just found out my girlfriend of 3 years has lied to me a lot about her sexual past.      She is a lesbian. And I am bi. I have found out that she has exaggerated her sexual experiences with men ie. what she did with them..and tried to sound more bisexual to me.She claimed to have done more sexually with men than is true.   And she also doubled her sexual partner number.      All of this has been a shock to me...suddenly she tells me her sex number is 16. And this seems very high as I am sure she said she has only been with no more than 5 in the beginning of our r/ship. And suddnenly she is trying to sound bisexual!      She slowly brought her number down..and then admitted she did some heavy petting with few women and turned that into 'sex' to try and sound ultra experienced to me.      I could not believe this!! who does that?  pretends they did more oral sex on men than they really did?      pretends they slept with double the women they really did?      her explanation?-  she felt very far away from me and could not relate to me being bi. For her, she has always struggled with her sexuality and only gone with men to confirm she is gay or to conform to society.      She felt so different to her own girlfriend and was worried I may lose interest in her if she does not relate to me as a bisexual. So she tried to make herself sound bi.      As for upping her sex number...I am more of an experimental person than she. I also have more of a wild past.       She claims that she feels maybe one day I may get bored of her sexually, and she can't suddenly pretend to be more experimental..whereas if she says she has slept with loads of women..she will look like she has had a wild past too.      Where is the logic here?      I cannot understand this and am really struggling with it. I love her dearly and she said she is working on her insecurities and will never lie about it again.      But who does that??      And with men, she tried to sound even more experienced

That makes absolutely no sense. I'm assuming Lucifer saw something he didn't like. God did give those REALLY EVIL rules in the old testament telling people to kill a lot of other people... I'm actually wondering.... maybe God is the evil character in this whole story. Maybe Lucifer is the leader of the rebellion. Rebel leaders always have a reason to rebel.

So on those grounds hair extensions was something that was considered as having that element of decept assimilated with it...However now I am married, my wifes intention is not to parade her hair extensions around the streets, impressing men, they are just for husband and wife pleasures. So my islamic view point on this issue is that ther eis no wrong or right here, just based on intention. Can anyone correct me? or assist me in this matter? regards

I think it is awesome that one little guy can come up with such an idea that would have such a huge impact on the world and also be brave enough to try it out and not give up either after his "failures".      What I think is that you DON'T need to be someone on the receiving end of Pay It Forward to Pay It Forward anyway.. Why not do something anyway, and start yet another cycle of Pay It Forward? Imagine what would happen if only 3 people did that? There would be 4 Pay It Forward movements going around the world.

20090223025204AApTsOL	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Good manners on a flight?	I was recently on a flight which was not full and there were plenty of empty seats onboard.  I had the window seat and sat near the ailse was a woman who must have already booked her seat.      When the plane took off she removed her black boots for comfort, she was wearing stockings and a skirt, as the flight continued she must have been tired and put her feet up on the other seat near me, anyway I could smell a sweaty smell near my face and could not imagine it was her until I realised it must have been her, the smell was quite strong and sweaty smelling I did feel a bit awkward because she was asleep but her feet were quite close to me and I thought I would wait a while until she awoke, thankfully the meal came and she let her feet down but did not put her boots back on so the smell was still there but not as strong.      Should I have asked her to put her boots back on or asked one of the stewards what do you do in this situation when you have someone who has smelly feet? what would you do?

For those who are well experienced in meditation, what are some advanced techniques / types of meditation that one can learn and practice eventually?      I have taken up meditation, and so far have learned and been practicing the Buddhist "Mindfulness of Breathing" technique. However, I have heard this referred to as a foundation that is used in other meditative practices, and am curious if someone can describe what some higher types of meditation can be, where they are taught, etc (I live in New England if you know of any centers in my area).      In particular, I am curioius if there is any form of meditation in which you focus on expanding a specific idea, instead of trying to clear your head of all thoughts - i.e. can I motivate on an idea for writing and expand on it creatively through meditation.

"Whoever curses (or verbally abuses) Ali, he has, in fact, cursed me, and whoever has cursed me, he has cursed Allah, and whoever has cursed Allah, then Allah will throw him into the Hell-fire".   Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, v6, p33         "Lisan al Arab" by Ibn Manzur states:      "Nawasib are those who hate Hadhrath Ali, and embrace that hatred as part of their faith"      "Taj al Uroous", we read:      "Nasibi are those who hate Ameer ul Momineen Ali bin Abi Talib (as) and take that enmity as part of their faith".      "Hadiya al Sahil" elaborates yet further:      "Nasibi ideology is a type of flawed character that is very bad, in its worst form is has a hatred for the Imam of Guidance Hadhrath Ali, and takes this as part of its Deen / Iman".      "One who fights 'Ali [r] with enmity is a kaffir according to the ijma of Ahl'ul Sunnah."   "Haddeeya Mujedeeya" by Al Muhaddith Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi page 813      "Whoever deems 'Ali [r] to be a kaffir or opposes his khilafath is a kaffir, this trait was evident amongst the Khawaarij at Naharwaan".   "Haddeeya Mujedeeya" by Al Muhaddith Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi page 813         "Taufa Ithna Ashari" states:      "Marwan was a Nasibi and was in fact its leader".      "Al Bidayah al Nihayah" Ibn Kathir states:      "Marwan was so evil that he would curse Hadhrath 'Ali".   "Al Bidayah al Nihayah" page 259, Volume 8 by Ibn Kathir      "Mu'awiya would curse Hadhrath 'Ali (as)".   "Fatwa Azizi" by al' Muhaddith Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi page 123      "Hatred of 'Ali is such a thing that no good deeds will benefit, whilst love of 'Ali is such a thing that no bad deeds will harm you"   al-Nasa'ih al-Kaafiyah page 67      "Al Bidayah al Nihayah" Ibn Kathir records that:      "Sad bin Abi Waqqas said to Mu'awiya you have sat me next me next to you on your throne and begun to curse Hadhrath 'Ali".   "Al Bidayah al Nihayah" page 341 Volume 7 the Chapter "The virtues of 'Ali".

"In God we trust" is on US currency which historically was an effort led by conservatives Christians to proudly put their deity on currency. On the other hand the newer Euro does not have references to religion on it.      I know many European banks require deposits of at least roughly $40,000 (US) for offshore accounts but you can if you want to support the Euro enter the currency market and invest in favor of the Euro so that when it rises against the dollar you earn money.

Not only was she beautiful on the outside but more importantly on the inside. Before she died, she would forget and tell me this story repeatedly. Each time I laughed like I never heard it before because it's so funny...      When mom was little it was common to give enema's for anything that ails you. Well, one day her family was going to town and my mother-in-law didn't want to go. So she and one of her sister's decided to stay home.       Soon they discovered that their pet duck was 'sick'. They didn't have an *enema* bag so they borrowed one from the neighbors.(hehe) After these 8 & 9 year old girls gave the duck an enema it really was sick.They looked around and saw their old german shepherd dog.. They gently laid him down on the ground. They patted his head, scratched behind the ears, kissed his nose...he was enjoying all this attention until all of a sudden...ouch..He didn't like that. He started growling and barking. He chased the two girls until they climbed a tree.       You can only imagine how things looked when the family returned  ...It only got worse...       By this time the Duck was DEAD. The girls were crying and stuck in the tree, the gentle old Dog got his bite back and was running around the tree in circles trying to snap at the girls...the neighbors were at the house trying to retrieve their enema bag back. =)      I'm looking forward to hearing your comments. Please be respectful so I can choose your comment as B/A. Thanks.
20090223064759AApwxLq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Baptism Necessary for Salvation?	Questions for those who believe baptism is necessary for salvation?    Was Abraham still in a state of damnation when he believed God and was declared righteous even though he hadn't been circumcised?    1. Rom. 4:1-5, "What then shall we say that Abraham, ??our forefather ??according to the flesh, has found?  2For if Abraham was justified ??by works, he has something to boast about, but ??not ??before God.  3For what does the Scripture say? “??Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” 4Now to the one who ??works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5But to the one who does not work, but ??believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness."      2. Gal. 3:5-6, "Does He then, who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? 6 Even so Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. 7 Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham."              1. Note:  Those who believe in New Testament times are to believe in the person of Christ, his work on the cross, his resurrection, etc.   # Likewise, when a person believes God is he declared righteous?         1. Notice that Rom. 4:1-5 speaks of Abraham being declared righteous by belief in God, before any ritual, and then Paul says in verse 5 that the one who believes in God his faith is credited as righteousness.      # If a person who believes is not declared righteous, then why isn't he?   # If a person who believes is declared righteous, then is he righteous without baptism?   # Is a sinner who has prayed and asked the Lord Jesus to forgive him of his sins actually forgiven or is he still in a state of damnation until he gets baptized?   # Is it unbiblical for someone to ask Jesus to forgive him of his sins and if he does so, is he forgiven or not?         1. Jesus said in John 14:14, "If you ask Me anything ??in My name, I will do it."      # A ritual is a set of forms and practices.  It is a ceremony.  Baptism is a ritual, a ceremony where one person administers baptism to another person.  Therefore, if you maintain that baptism is necessary for salvation, are you not saying that salvation is by faith and a ritual?   # Can you please tell us if such a man who is believed in Christ and received him, yet dies without being baptized goes to eternal damnation?         1. If you say no, then baptism is not necessary for salvation.      2. If you say yes, then he is not declared righteous by faith.

So I hid her in my attic.'                 The priest replied, 'That was a wonderful thing you did, and you have no need to confess that.'                 'There is more to tell, Father.

The priest said, 'That was a long time ago, and by doing what you did, you placed the two of you in great danger; but two people under those circumstances can easily succumb to the weakness of the flesh. However, if you are truly sorry for your actions, you are indeed forgiven.'                 'Thank you, Father. That's a great load off my mind. I do have one more question.'

20090426181913AAstMjk	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Ladies! Especially feminists! Please explain to me thoroughly why this sentence is sexist!!?	"Women are generally physically weaker than men"   Why is this sexist? Isn't this a fact, since men have more testosterone?   The definition of sexism is the discriminatory and abuse of the opposite sex. And the definition of discriminatory is being biased or having a belief or attitude formed beforehand   Like saying blacks are stupid is discriminatory because this is biased and many proofs stated it as untrue, like MLK Jr.   But women generally speaking has less testosterone, and weaker than men is a fact, it is not biased   Like the standard of the grade "A" for P.E. in middle schools and high schools for female students are less than male students because of this   like the statement that gun violence in America is greater than in Japan is a fact and not a discriminatory because it is illegal for civilians to own guns   And notice that I used the word GENERALLY SPEAKING, which leaves the opening that women can be as strong as men, but just not as common. AS COMMON   so   why is it sexist   WARNING: any answer shorter than twenty words are going to be reported and the person, blocked

20090222230352AAeWffZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do I need to change my avatar & username for people to take me seriously as a Christian?	I'm not satanic.  15 odd years ago when the internet was still new, I read a book about the Jersey Devil and used that as my online identity.  However, everyone assumed I was from New Jesey, which is why I changed to Mercer Devil (I was born in Mercer County, OH).  The uniqueness has allowed me to keep using it ever since.      I worry that people doubt I'm truly Christian since I use a devil avatar.  Should I change it to appear more credible, or just not worry about people that jump to false conclusions?

20090222223406AAokWeL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When do we come to terms with death?	I had an unusual experience a few years ago. A patient of mine (I'm a nurse) was 93 and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He was so devastated that the cancer was going to kill him. I was sensitive to his feelings but in my head I was like "um, seriously you're 93 and you never had the thought that you might die soon?". I mean I could understand if he was in his 40's, but in his 90's? I guess I just assumed that death becomes less scary as we get older. What do you think? Do we ever come to terms with our own mortality or does it still scare us to the end?

20090223071924AAj3S8s	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	25:26 -- "Misbeliever" correct translation? = some Muslims?	Qur'an 25:26 in Yusuf Ali translation says Judgment Day will be a difficult day "for the misbelievers."      Other translations I checked have this translated as "all those who deny truth."      Since Ali also uses the word "unbeliever" throughout his translations, I am thinking he made a correct distinction in 25:26 to use the word "misbeliever" as the passages that follow, 25:27-30, especially 29 and 30, indicate Muslims are being talked about here. So "misbeliever" is a correct interpretation because they are not unbelievers being talked about here, but rather Muslims who go astray, not paying attention to the instructions and lessons in Qur'an as indicated by 25:29-30.      29 "He did lead me astray   From the Message   After it had come to me!   Ah! the Evil One is   But a traitor to man!"      30 Then the messenger will say:   "Oh my Lord! Truly   My people took this Qur'an   For just fooolish nonsense."      Next question to make this even more interesting this morning, if there are places where Qur'an conflicts with sunnah or hadith, are you a misbeliever if you follow sunnah or hadith above Qur'an?      And 3rd question, if Qur'an does not forbid something, are you a misbeliever if you follow sunnah or hadith to do what Allah says in Qur'an not to do and make unlawful things that Allah has made lawful?

20090223074049AA053kC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Muslims do you feel that Islam is not about to re-gain its past glory?	Many signs have been observed which indicate that Islam is rising again and will soon regain its past glory. Look at these facts.      1. Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world.   2. 500 Christians and Jews are accepting Islam daily in America and Canada alone. Islam is spreading fast in Europe and Asia as well.   3. A backward and destitute nation like Afghanistan has defeated Soviet Union and caused her break up into dozens of states, which is a living miracle.   4. Afghanistan is now poised to throw the invaders out within a year.   5. Many signs have been seen in Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim countries. Name of Nabi Muhammad SAW has been seen on the sky, written with clouds, on hill tops and in caves suggesting that the final message he brought is soon going to become the leading religion of the world.   6. Interest based financial system of the west has collapsed but the Islamic profit and loss sharing system has done well, in the contempory world. Islamic nations have not seen any financial melt down.   7. Recently satellites of US and Russia collided in the space and the submarines of  UK and France were indulged in a head on collsion, indicating decline of their military might.   Have you seen any such signs?  Do you think that time for  prophecy of holy prophet about Islam entering every building, hut or tent in the world, is about to come true?

Okay one thing I do not like at all are two-faced fake people, I mean okay there's this girl that assumes I'm scary just because I have never ever talked to her until now, she calls my phone and blocks her number so I don't know where shes calling from because she knows if she hangs up I'm going to call her back, she talks good noise about me behind my back but isn't woman enough to say the crap to my face and when I confront her about it, she's running scared like a puppy with its tail tucked between it's legs.  I'm getting sick of it.  If she isn't woman enough to open up her mouth and come talk to me personally about whatever it is that she has against me then she needs to shut up and quit making me a daily part of her life.  Seriously how do I deal with her because I'm so fed up with her childishness and I can't ignore her because then she'll be like I'm scary (and one thing Kiara's not is scary) when in all actuality she's the only scary one here.

20090223065338AA3ArZF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Satanism is "Religious Atheism and self worship"?	I was reading an interview with one of the Church of Satan priests who said that Satanism is basically "Religious atheism and carnal self worship"  Because all Satanists are atheists and know that all idea's of spirituality and Gods are man made creations.  He said that Satanism is about carnality and materialism and reality and has no room for spirituality, the supernatural or occultism.  Satanists know that this is the only life we have and it is up to us to make the most of it.        So my question is am I crazy for loving this idea of a religion that is based finally on reality instead of the occult non sense you get from other religions like christianity?  I mean how can you not love a religion that is based on loving life and your human instincts instead of the other religions which to teach you to go against your nature and to worship death instead of life?

N the people who don't agree, keep calling her close-minded, and that she is forcing her opinion onto them. When in fact she didn't .      She was only saying the "benefit" of not having sex b4 marriage.       So everyone took it as a personal attack, n called her arrogant, immature, and disrespect. When she never ever attacked them.    Never said anything personal back.       So they keep repeating themselves, instead of reasoning, saying shes close-minded etc.. so here is her reply:       "Ur really unreasonable. Since when did i disrespect people for having an opinion? I question their opinion. I don't agree with everything u know. Questioning and disrespecting is different. "      "Also, if i reason, it's because i want to make sense.   I don't force people to believe me. & plus, if what i said don't make sense.. u wouldn't believe it no matter what i say."      Basically, everyone is entitle to their own opinion, after she said that... they continue to call her arrogant, immature, brat etc..      Heres her reply:       "there's no right or wrong in the argument, everyone is entitled to their opinions. What works for you doesn't always work for everyone."      & then later...    "Fine, i be the bigger person here, n be the one to stop replying. "      & then they continued, n they saying she is disrespecting etc.. n saying it's too late to call urself bigger person etc..

The thought just struck me, it appears that a lot of the christians (and theists in general) don't want us on R&S (by us i mean my fellow savages and infidels, unbelievers and god haters), but how far do they want this exclusion to run, if they can barely manage to keep it civil and non discriminatory on an anonymous Q&A site where does that leave us in the long term?      Christians where exactly does the bigotry stop, do you want the atheists out of 'your' forums, out of 'your' country, out of 'your' world, (just so you know christians don't aren't the majority in the world, aren't the majority in over half of the worlds countries let alone websites)
20090223053245AAB308G	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has spiritual Israel turned Mat 28:19 into a "golden calf" ?	Just one verse of scripture cannot prevail over the entire New Testament.  The imagined contradiction is in not understanding what the words mean.  Mat 28:18-19: "All power/authority in heaven and earth is given unto me.  Go ye therefore unto all nations teaching and baptising in the Name of The Father, Son and Holy Ghost".   With these words Jesus is declaring the extent of His authority, which is universal, even including all aspects of The Eternal Godhead.  It is NOT a verbatim formula for the rite of baptism.  The Name He refers to is His own.      "All the fullness of The Godhead dwelleth in Him bodily and ye are complete in Him who is the head of all principality and power."  Thats Jesus.

Hey, I came out to my parents three weeks ago. They put on a brave face, said they had no problem with my being gay, but they had a problem with my coming out to other people. I'm a 22 year old guy doing a health science degree and they say that I am entering a highly conservative field and that I will never get a job if it's known I'm gay. They say I will be constantly abused by others, and my dad said I should start building muscle as I am apparently going to be beaten up someday. I told them I had told my two best friends and they were horrified, acted like I had been going around telling everyone in the world. I didn't dare tell them I'd gone to an LGBT club. My mom has been really upset these past two weeks now because I have 'told people'. They don't understand that I want a boyfriend. "Why would you want to be in a relationship at your age?" my dad asked. "you're in college now to get a degree. Give it some time, see how you feel in a few years." He clearly thinks I'm just going through a phase.   Anyway, the thing is, they've really scared me. They've really made me slow down and think I'm going to be hounded for the rest of my life. I don't want to make a decision I might regret in ten years, such as get a boyfriend now and then realise no one will harm me. But can I choose a job over a relationship? Please help.

It appears the money follows the people, so does the crime. An American city is the second largest kidnapping city in the World. It seems illegal immigrants have brought their problems along with them. Soon their will probably be executions( if there are not already ) like the ones in Mexico. People like to hope things will get better or just call others racist for pointing out growing problems like this, but it is not helping.

My last period was on 12th January 09, and we are trying to conceive so thought we'd try out those clearblue ovulation tests, I did one on 13th February at random and it gave us a smiley face, I thought I'd do it again on 15th Feb, just to see if it gave us a smiley face again, which it did NOT.       So on 17th Feb we got 2 positive hpt's.       I thought it took so many days to come up positive after ovulating.      I tested again and got positives on 18th, 20th and 21st Feb.      Right so on Saturday 21st Feb, I started bleeding, just as if I was having my period, and also had period like pains, so rang NHS Direct incase of miscarriage, they got a doctor to call me and he said it was probably a miscarriage, however I havent yet explained about the ovulation dates etc.        I've done a pregnancy test again today and it says positive still. (I know it can take so many weeks for the HCG levels to go back to normal again!)       I'm just so confused about ovulation dates etc, none of it seems to link in.

20090222224609AAS7tnF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are Mystical experiences real?	Experiences where people come back more compassionate, loving, in tune with nature, and less fearful. It does not matter if it is was induced from a near death experience, deep meditation, psychedelic substances, or just some random experience.          Like when somehow eternity comes out in between time. Like, someone would have grown up normally in the world and adopted their rational outlook and common sense that everyone believes and shares with one another, then had one of these experiences, where they are completely removed from all that conditioning, language, and emotional baggage that shape them as a ‘personality’ in space and time. They are taken out of that and shown the eternal unconditioned reality.      Are these experiences just mere physiological chemical reactions in the brain that have no meaning or do these chemical reactions perturb the function of the brain in a way that allows one to reach higher levels of consciousness? Levels where much of the wisdom and revelations embedded in the worlds mythologies originate from.

I come from a country were pretty much everyone are atheists or only believe in a vague 'something' and don't care about the bible or church or any of that.      Now, being on all of these american sites and watching TV shows and such, I sometimes get really freaked out by what people are saying. Like on Oprah for example, people ar talking about 'giving themselves to God' and everyone is like "wow, good for you". ...jikes. And all this talk about 'doing God's will', it seems like a person can do anything, murder, rape, destroy, and then say "Oh, it was the will of God, I was only doing his bidding." Even the freaking Pope and the Cardinals have been in involved in molesting little boys, and then they're like "God will forgive me." What? WHAT? What kind of ****** up God is that, even if he existed? And all wars in the world always seem to have something to do with religion. Killing in the name of God. Killing innocent people just because their beliefs are different.      God, the ultimate excuse. Am I the only one who find religious people incredibly scary?

It would seem if they truly believe God is all powerful, they would also believe God can do his own killing.  In addition, it would seem God would reserve that right to kill to himself.  After all, if one truly believes God is all powerful, and the creator of all, then believer does not own even his or her's own life, let alone another, in the context of killing.

20090222223851AAIkDuo	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I can't understand my girlfriend's sexual history?	I have dated my girlfriend for 3 years. And when we met she told me she is a lesbian but has experimented in the past with male friends but did not enjoy it. She now lives a very lesbian open life to friends, work and family.      I accepted this. And I thought she also accepted me as a bisexual. A bisexual who had a history with men and boyfriends, and just girl flings.. but was looking for a solid relationship now with a woman.      2 years into our relationship, she started to make comments about being bi herself. She started to say "sometimes I think I am bi" and then "I wouldn't rule out going with a man in the future".  She also started to tell me the details of her male past. I was always curious as she had never had a boyfriend, or really dated men but seemed to have had experiences with them. I asked her one day what she did..and she told me and it seemed a lot. Anyway, I started doubting her lesbianism a bit..she gave me all the signs. Meanwhile, she had started to doubt my loyalty and got insecure that I would leave her for a man one day!       later, I found she had exaggerated her sexual past with men. She had said she had gone down on two guys (when really it was a brief thing with one guy) and guys had gone down on her (not true). She had also tried making it out like going with men was no big deal for her. It was all ok. She wanted to sound like she had lots of experience with men too.      So now I find out that going with men, is in fact it is a big deal for her. It;s not nice for her. She is an extreme lesbian and not bi at all. She was merely trying to desperately relate to me...to find common ground with a bisexual. She felt far away from me and said that I represented something she has always struggled against and she couldn't ultimately relate to how I may have 'chosen' to go with men out of desire. When for her...she only went with men to confirm she was gay.      Now this is something I am now struggling with. Her first time was with a guy who took her on a date when she was 16. At the time, she was very much thinking she was gay and felt no crushes on any men. She felt like an outsider. Now this particular guy happened to be a bit dodgy and insinuated she go down on him on first date...and she did so briefly but it was awful for her. Couple of years later, she felt she was ready to come out as gay to her parents (age 19) but she wanted to make 100% certain she was gay and reaffirm her sexuality. So she did mutual masturbation with this male friend of hers. Again, this is a guy she had no romantic or sexual attraction to. No crush or anything..yet she decided to touch with him. And she found it awkward and gross and she came out soon after.      Unfortunately her parents reacted badly to her coming out and said she has to be straight or else they will disown her. They also tried telling her intercourse is great. So she was on some uni trip overseas for 3 months and some guy happened to fancy her the whole time..she of course, did not fancy him at all. But she wanted to again confirm things as her parents gave her doubt.       So this guy makes a move on her, and she slept with him.  And she did not like it at all. It did nothing for her, was uncomfortable and 'gross' as she put it.      After that, she never went with guys again.      just like she can't understand how I could go with men out of desire...i can't understand how she could go with three guys she had NO feelings for. I know she had to confirm her sexuality..but couldn't she have dated these men first?  to see if there was romance there?  surely everyone knows sex is only good when you have feelings or attraction to someone??      i don't get how she could just have sex so easily like that with three men, to 'confirm' her sexuality. Does anyone else understand this?

20090223064321AA9N0hJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Any good books to further my knowledge of my faith?	I am a follower of Theistic Satanism, i would like to find a good book that talks more about my religion. I am not talking about the false LaVeyan Satanic Bible here, i mean Theistic Satanism, which is:      Theistic Satanism...      Satanism is not a "Christian invention."      Satanism predates Christianity and all other religions.      Satanism is not about spooks, goblins, vampires, Halloween monsters or other related entities.      Satanism is not about "evil."      Satanism is not a "reaction" to Christianity.      Satanism is not about death.      True Satanism is about elevating and empowering humanity, which was our True Creator (Satan's) intention.      We know Satan/Lucifer as a real being.      We know Satan to be the True Father and Creator God of humanity.      We know "Yaweh/Jehova" of the bible to be a fictitious entity, and the people behind coercing this lie, to be the true deceivers of humanity and the masters of lies. This is evident in the many contradictions within the Judeo/Christian Bible, revealing this text to be the work of human beings who had occult knowledge and infused it with power to make it credible, and to incite fear in order to control.      We are law abiding.      We DO NOT advocate or participate in any blood or living sacrifice. This act is Judeo/Christian, as stated in their Bible- Deuteronomy 12:27:   "And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh."
20090223052541AAuqH2f	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you think this was racist?	I am a 14 year old white boy. I was at the shops two days ago, and I had a chocolate bar. There was a black guy stacking the shelves, I think he was about 18, and I've seen him there before. I think he works there part time.      So anyway, I was in the frozen section, and put down the chocolate bar, because I didn't want it anymore. He screamed at me, and said I was disrespectful and inconsiderate, and should put it back where it belongs. He told me to put it back where it's supposed to be, but I said no, so he got me by the arm and dragged mre to where the aisle was, and made me put it there.      I was really embarrassed, and I wonder, if I was black, would he have made such a fuss?

I know that imperfect contrition is detestation of sin from a more inferior motive such as fear of hell. Can you still be absolved even if you don't experience perfect contrition?            Follow up questions:      1. Other people would not confess their sins to priests because they prefer to confess "directly to God." They believe that priests are just mere human beings that doesn't have the power to absolve us from our sins. Can you give me one good reason why people should confess to priests? Not that i don't want to but I'm just curious.

Ok here the basics... for a long time now I could see a hue or after image around people. I thought this was perfectly normal and everyone else saw them to. I finally talked with my mother when I found out this wasn't so. She told me not to talk what I see. So, after years of not talking about what I can see, and after having a mental breakdown I talk to a really cool theripist. Dr. Finniely told that what I was seeing  were people's Auras. What? Yes she told she can't see them but she know of those who can. It was kinda scary stuff seeing inside complete strangers like that. But Dr Fin told me I should find the other people who can see what I see and learn how to gain control of them better. So, my question is is there anyone out  there near the Missouri Pomm de Terr area that is willing to help a 18 year old girl that sees other people's auras?   Thanks a much

20090222222322AAeqJyu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Friends........Please Enlighten Me?	Why is there a right and wrong? Have you ever asked yourself this question? What makes something right and what makes something wrong? Imagine a world, where you could do whatever you want? No one to stop you from your hearts desire, if you like the car you just take it! If someone offends you, you have the right to hurt or even kill them. What’s the problem with this scene?      Well if you are like me, you might think, “What if I am on the other side?” What if I am the guy who owned the car or I am the guy who offended the person?” The world would be a chaotic place to live if everybody got there hearts desire. What is the basis of rules? Who said its wrong to steal, murder or rob? The real question being asked is who determines our morality, and why should we care?      In Mexico, before Cortez (1485-1587) it was morally acceptable to have child sacrifice, in the South before the Civil War, slavery was acceptable. Why did morality change? In Hitler’s Germany, killing the Jews was a noble act! Did it become wrong only because Germany lost the war? If Germany won World War II, would the killers have been heroes instead of villains?       Is there are standard outside of us, which determines what is right   and wrong?

20090223064237AAInYBc	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Hunting down a letter of recommendation?	I asked my former boss to write me a letter of recommendation for graduate school back in November. I reminded him again in early January and set a deadline for late February. Well, I've already applied to the school and my other recommendation writer finished hers in about 4 days, and it was sent with my other materials. The only thing that isn't in is my former boss's letter.       I told him that everything is in but his... and this was about two weeks ago. I said "I don't mean to hassle you, especially since I set the deadline for late February," but the sooner everything is in, the sooner they can review my application and give me an answer." He said he would do it within the week. He didn't. (I can tell through the online system of the school I'm applying to). I'm getting kind of annoyed, but I can't badger him anymore.. can I? Also, he is heading to New Mexico for vacation in a few days, and I'm sure he won't be doing it then.

I got banned from a forum for 'bigotry', but for the life of me couldn't figure out what was the cause of this.. since, well.. I'm not a bigot and therefore don't act as one. Then it struck me that it may have been because I used the word 'ghey'.      Regarding a photo I posted of myself in a self-picture-posting category:   "My fringe grew out so my face is visible in this one... But face-on is ghey."      Its really just a word I occasionally use, and until now haven't really thought about how connected it is with the word 'gay'.    I guess, thinking about it, it could be offensive...   I assure you I have no deep-rooted prejudice against homosexual people, and the idea that someone thinks I do is quite mortifying, actually.    I'm feeling really horrible, to think that I may have offended somebody.      What do you think, could it be this?   In your opinion, is it bigotry?      Thank you :)

20090223054738AABeb3R	Society & Culture;Languages	Japanese forms of address for adults and parents?	I’m writing a modern-setting English language story that, among the cast, features a Japanese man.  While the Japanese dialogue will be written in English as though translated, I wanted to leave his forms of address and any honorifics intact.      First part of this question:  This character was wise beyond his years as a child, and as a “side-effect” of that, would mistakenly address all adults as though they were social equals.  Kind of like an American kid calling an adult by their first names.  How would this be expressed in Japanese?      Second part:  The boy grows up and eventually learns polite forms of address.  However, he retains one quirk, which is that he continues to address his mother as an equal.  I can’t think of any English language equivalent.  He doesn’t call her by her name, and may call her something akin to “mom,” but the idea is she belittled his intelligence as a child and was obsessed with “respect,” and so he makes these little digs at her as an adult while still largely being congenial in conversation.  How would he address her?

Don't tell me this is a mis-translation, I've used KJV and MILLIONS use KJV, if there is ONE mis-translation that means there are most likely several others and it should not be followed; due to reading 'false' words of God.

Thing is i've been depressed since an early age, and i'm gay so i'm sort of having a hard time accepting that at the moment. That's sort of the real reason i'm constantly anxious and stressed...just i can't control it anymore cause i'm sick.      Should i tell the psychologist about all this stuff? That i'm gay, been depressed since i was 7 because i've been referred...but i'm not sure if i should tell them cause i don't want parents to find out or be like why am i still seeing a shrink just for anxiety? But i have completely broken down twice in three weeks and cried on my best friends shoulder unable to cope....      My other option is to wait and try and get through it all because once they work out wats wrong and treat/manage it i can handle everything again and keep it bundled up inside until i'm older and can see a shrink without parents asking questions...

Before I go on, I want to point out that I firmly believe being gay is NOT a choice. I believe it to be natural, and something your born with, just like the hair or eye color your born with.       Anywho, people claim that homosexual men & women only 'claim' it's not a choice to make it natural, therefore more acceptable. But why would they have to? This is America, Home of the Free (*cough* SUPPOSEDLY *cough*), we are free to make our own choices and live the way we want. Why would the gay community have to defend themselves? Could you not just simply consider what they are telling you is that gospel truth, that they born that way??? Is that really so hard to believe? I mean who would know better than the people who are actually ARE gay, right?       If it was a choice, I would see no reason for them to deny it, why should they hide it IF it were a choice? Like I said, home of the free. We live the way we want.      Why should they need to defend who they are like that?

20090223044506AAZmIrs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Houris, Virgins and grapes(????) in Islam?	OK, so I was reading this question  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  and found an answer that was really weird.      There was this guy who states that the houris, or virgins, promised in the Koran are actually grapes. After about 10 years studying Islam, I have never seen a single Islamic scholar mistake the houris mentioned in the Koran for anything other than female virgins (the number 72 is never even mentioned in the Koran, but is mentioned in the Hadith).      Whats up with this grape thing? Is there an Islamic source that actually makes this weird claim? Please advice as I would like to update my knowledge.
20090223062802AAucYVd	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do I have to accept the job permanently after the trial?	First off, I am not working for any agency. I have not signed a single contract. I just started on the day and got paid by cheque the next week.          She said I will be put on a three month trial before the job goes permanent so I am currently just a temp worker.. I have been here for a month but this job is not for me as I have a feeling she wants to make it full-time when she finally does make it permanent. For personal reasons which I do not wish to disclose to her, I am unable to do it full-time. Should I let her know now or just look out for another job before I quit?      The reason why I'm finding it difficult to tell her is because if I tell her now, she might let me go within the next few days and then I would have to sign on. I would much rather sign up with a temp agency and then have a job ready before I tell her. But that might take several weeks.

20090223054419AAVjuba	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians -- I am so ungreatful.......?	When I ask God to do a certain thing for me, He does it. I just keep asking Him and asking Him for more things and he doesn't even turn His face away from me, He just does it. Now, I just realized that I am not very thankful of the things that He does for me...and I hate myself for this. I often take credit for the things that He does and say that "I" did them, when knowing in the back of my head that there was NO way that I could have done that -- knowing that He is the one who brought me through.    Can you give me a Bible verse that speaks of being ungreatful and/or speaks of how become more thankful?

20090223055836AAITO9G	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Has a stranger every said to you "Hey, you look familiar. Do I know you?"?	And I'm NOT talking about some cheesy pickup line either. For about the past year, at least once / month I get someone say "Hey, you look familiar?...etc."  Then I get a bunch of questions of such as:   - "Do you know so-and-so?"   - "Did you ever go to such and such school?"   - "Did you ever work at such and such?"   All the time I say 'Nope' to the above questions because I don't have the commonality with them. It's from both genders. And always when I'm out by myself running errands or something, never when I'm with my friends. I get a little taken by surprise by it.  I admit that I don't tend to volunteer information such as saying "Oh, I never worked there but I DID work @ blah blah place."     Also I cut over a foot and a half of hair off in November and shaved my goatee so I look a LOT different, and it still happens. AND I moved to a different town in June 08 (1/2 an hr West)   I did bartend some years ago and I used to be pretty social but I don't know if that's it.  It's kinda eerie actually.        Most of the time I say "Sorry, you must be thinking of someone else." but the last two times I shrugged and said "I have that kind of face." But I realize that may sound a little conceited. I'm not rude but I still find it slightly offputting.       Has this every happened to you?  What do you do about it? Should I feel flattered? No rude or sarcastic answers please.

20090223063216AAgbclS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you prove you are a true christian believer?	The Bible has a scientific test how to identify a true believer. It is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark, Ch. No.16, Verse No.17 and 18 - It says that... 'There will be signs for true believers and among the signs - In my name they shall cast out devils, they shall speak foreign tongues, new tongues, they shall take up serpents - And if they drink deadly poison, they shall not be harmed - And when they place their hand over the sick, they shall be cured.' This is a scientific test - In scientific terminology, it is known as the 'confirmatory test' for a true Christian believer. In my whole life, I have personally interacted with thousands of Christians, I have not come across a single Christian, who has passed this confirmatory test of the Bible. I have not come across a single Christian who took poison not died. And in scientific terminology, this is also called as the 'falsification test' That means if a false person tries and does this test... takes poison, he will die. And a false person will not dare attempt this test - If you are not a true Christian believer, you will not dare attempt this test. Because you try and attempt the falsification test, you will fail. So a person who is not a true Christian believer, will never attempt this test.       you guys can also try the 1 Kings 18 test first:       "22 Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. 23 Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. 24 Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire—he is God.""      I'd like to see the Christians agree to that Biblical test, but I imagine they're afraid of the Biblically-endorsed consequences:       ""38 Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.       39 When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!"       40 Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. "

20090223055504AAzwM1m	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My friend told me that her bf had experiences?	With guys. But he was very vague about it. She was not shocked b/c she has seen him look at guys and girls in public. However she did not judge him by his past because she really liked where the relationship was. She felt the less she know the better. They have been dating nearly six months now. He suddenly opened up to her about being engaged to a man a couple years ago and his promise to himself to never be with one again. His reasoning for being a part of that lifestyle had to do with the absence of his alcoholic father and even sexual harassment from his friend's uncle as a child. This time she was shocked a bit but she was just happy he opened up.       Now after thinking on it she is a bit confused. He has dated women before dating men and even after dating men. He had two situations after that engagement but both were short lived. This is his first long term relationship since then**. Is it kind of late or heavy to bring it all up now? He said he felt bad that it all was said at once. The only shocking part is she had assumed this was further in his past! He is very physical with her and caters to pleasing her a lot so the gay part doesnt add up. Her bf doesn't identify with being gay or bisexual, but idk! He is still friends with his "friends" but not physically with them. What does she do? Stay with him and support his decisions or no?, she does not want to offend him but confused b/c she cares about him.

I mean right now, Dahmer probably is up in heaven enjoying a nice gift basket of steamed Puerto Ricans care of Yeshua, and my grammy is being forced to give Satan a handy.     This message is mainly aimed at evangelicals. I want to make it clear that my grandmother absolutely did not believe in the trinity.  She  also believed Jesus died on a stake and not a cross. Plus she believed that Jesus himself was not god, but in fact god's son.     As you can see, she was no Kirk Cameron. Please be specific in your answer about where my grandmother is.  Don't just tell me a bible verse. I know the verse, that's why I'm asking about my mimaw.

20090223054411AA30g7o	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What exactly do homophobes think gay people DO?	I recently saw this documentary where a really conservative guy said there were two Americas - gays and working people. I'm guessing he's lumping liberals, artists, and maybe even white collar workers in with "gays." But a few months back, I read this thing about a homophobic guy who went to live with a gay guy in San Francisco for a month for this TV show. When he got back home, his dad asked, "What do they do for money?" and was genuinely surprised to hear that - yes - gay people have JOBS!      This surprises me, since I always thought that careers like interior design, fashion design, work in theatre and the arts, and so on, were stereotyped as gay careers. I figured everybody knew of the stereotype, and that homophobes in particular believed it. But now I'm not so sure. I live inside a gay-friendly liberal bubble, so I have to ask: do homophobes think gay people don't work? And so expand on that, how do they think gay people live in general? I mean, I've heard the stereotypes about partying every night, having sex with lots of different people, doing drugs, what have you, but is there more to it?

Being one of those who take Yahoo Answers seriously, it is painful to find that some readers seem to enjoy giving "thumbs down" ,even, for considered responses. I am beginning to wonder if some people enjoy being so negative as to block all educated reasoning and, thus, spoil the tone and tenor of a useful discussion- which , I suppose, is the raison de tre behind this website. Like many others I spend a great deal of time and effort in organising a considered response, only to see such response given a negative mark WITHOUT, it seems ,  ever trying to understand the substance behind the staements.         I believe that all discussions should be thoroughly considered to produce a compendium of knowledge. Your comments, please. Many thanks,

There are people who have a 6th sense. But for me, it is completely different. I do have a 6th sense but not with eyes but with my ears. I hear the ghost but i never see them. The only time I see a ghost is when my mind is clear or when I am stress free or just relaxed. I dont know how I do it but I just see them. Its either a shadow of the ghost or the ghost itself but it stays there for like 10 seconds then itz gone. It does scare me but I just get used to it. I do get feelings that someone is beside me or looking at me when no one is there. But the most confusing one is that I can hear them but dont see them. When hearing them, its either they're talking in a whispery voice or if their walking around making noise. Trust me, there are times that ghosts actually visit me, and Ive had more than 7-10 experiences with ghosts. There is one night that a devil or bad spirit came to visit me at like 2:00-3:00 in the morning. Shook my bed(that's why I woke up) and almost I mean almost walked up my stairs becuz he took a big noise step up the stairs. But i only heard it. SO my question is.

Shook my bed(that's why I woke up) and almost I mean almost walked up my stairs becuz he took a big noise step up the stairs. But i only heard it. SO my question is. What is it called if you can only hear ghosts but sometimes see them but can feel them too? But mostly hearing? I know it sounds stupid of what I said but at least i'm not the only one :)

I have been learning Polish and I have never found an online Polish dictionary that is capable of handling conjugations, etc.  I mostly use a paper dictionary and occasionally use Poltran (which isn't very useful because it gives imprecise definitions and doesn't get conjugations; I mostly use it to make sure something means approximately what I think it does).  Is there any comprehensive free online dictionary that will give complete definitions of words and understand the various conjugations thereof?

I and the other guys have noticed a lot of hostility towards her by the other girls in the office. When we go out to lunch, she eats with us, 3 or 4 guys, instead of the other girls. She's also been rudely cut off while speaking by the other women during meetings. They go out of their way to make her feel unwelcome. I don't get why women are so threatened by a pretty, smart girl in the workplace of all places ? I mean its not like we're banging each other that the girls should be defending their turf or something. I don't get it.

20090223071729AAHFg82	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did Einstein reject Christianity?	"The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this."      And fundamental Judaism:      "For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them."

Sorry, I posted this a couple of hours ago, but I can't log into my old account, so I started a new one.      I am a 14 year old white boy. I was at the shops two days ago, and I had a chocolate bar. There was a black guy stacking the shelves, I think he was about 18, and I've seen him there before. I think he works there part time.      So anyway, I was in the frozen section, and put down the chocolate bar, because I didn't want it anymore. He screamed at me, and said I was disrespectful and inconsiderate, and should put it back where it belongs. He told me to put it back where it's supposed to be, but I said no, so he got me by the arm and dragged mre to where the aisle was, and made me put it there.      I was really embarrassed, and I wonder, if I was black, would he have made such a fuss?

I've watched on youtube, but i would still like further information on them.    does anyone know any websites that explain what they are and how they work?   See, i have my anti-eyebrow pierced and im afraid it's going to reject. but it's my favorite piercing. so if it does i want to get to different microdermal or dermal (idk) piercings. and can they even do it on scar tissue? what is the process of that kind of piercing? How do you take care of it after? Are there any dangers? Later on down the road, how do you take it out? and is it easy to change the jewelry? any other info you think would be important would be nice.    thanks!
20090223072924AA6DKIw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can I possibly continue my life?	All my life I have been forsaken to have a destiny filled with eternal torment and grief. I never had true friends or a girlfriend. I never had the things I wanted most. Every day for the past 5 years have been like a nightmare knowing that every tomorrow would be another today. I hold back tears that my heart wishes to cry because I know I'll never have friendship, true love, and that my dreams will never come to be. I feel like its time I let go of my false hope and stop dreaming the impossible and end my nightmare. I've been on all sorts of medications for depression and seen many therapists but by sorrow pierces through the false emotion of happiness that those horrid medications provide. Nothing can help me or release the shackles that bind me to a fate of sorrow. My life is valueless and meaningless. I'm totally insignificant in the grand picture of life and hold no purpose. I know I'm worthless compared to everyone else. I'm like something that should be discarded. I found an undetectable poison that can put me into cardiac arrest and it will appear to be natural causes in the autopsy. My family will miss me but their pain will not be nearly as much as I would have had if I continue to live. How can I go on with my life when I don't have anything to live for? How can I live when I know my dreams will never be? Is life really worth it when the only path that I will walk is a path of eternal sorrow?

20090223073200AAq4Ce5	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do people that trip on Shrooms become desensitized from reality?	Two months ago I ate psychedelic mushrooms for the second time in my life. My first trip I don't remember any of because I smoked too much swag while on it. This second trip I decided not to smoke any weed even though I had a decent half-eighth off hand. The best part of the trip was when I was listening to the song Lateralis, following the lyrics and feeling the guitar made me feel something far from any human emotion that I've ever felt. It wasn't a joy, it wasn't euphoria but an describable feeling of inspiration and knowledge. I closed my eyes to escape the physical world, I felt as though I had been traveling through fields and fields energy perfectly synchronized with each instrument of the song. The song was guiding me through this unbelievable experience I just barely scratched the surface of. After the song was over I knew there were forces beyond any of our human senses that exist all around us everyday.. As if supernatural powers were just waiting to be unlocked by whoever dared to fathom them. I want to know if my words here appeal to anyone else with similar beliefs about our human divinity.

20090223073902AA0Ed5E	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people follow fashion trends?	It is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. A bunch of "fashionistas" tell you what to wear for the season and crap. Why don't people think for themselves and what they think looks nice on them and not what looks nice on other people. To be honest most the expensive clothing is HIDEOUS! And yet people buy it and wear. Has society gone so stupid that you'll do whatever someone tells you to do? I honestly don't follow fashion trends, If I don't like it, I won't wear it.
