20090131115506AAbK0xd	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Here's the blurb & prologue to my book...if it fits...?	Blurb:      It’s Wilson vs. White.      It’s Arrogance vs. Modesty.      It’s Head vs. Heart.      It’s always been like that for Alyssa. All her life, she’s been brought up an enemy to the opposition. Determined from childhood, fighting an opponent she never knew, never really understood, yet, never denied. Never back down, never give up.  All she really knew was to listen to her heart, and to live in Love.       Connor was never new to the ‘Hate game’. he grew up, playing it all his life, hearing it, taking it in, doing the same as the people around him; hating the people he never knew, never knew why, all he knew was to hate, to never love. Yet, all he knew was to live in Love.      Prologue:      “Are you still going to that party at Cameron’s, the one we have every month?” she asked me; I shrugged, I wanted to go, but mom really wouldn’t let me if I asked. I looked at her, Jess, my best friend since...forever... “Yeah, I’m going.” I replied to her question, I’d made up my mind, I wouldn’t tell mom that it was at Cam’s place, I would say it was at someone else’s house...maybe I’d say it was at Sarah’s, but I could also say that it was at Emily’s too...    “What are you gonna tell your mom Ally!?” Jess asked, clearly concerned about what was gonna happen if my mom found out...she’d probably ground me for the rest of my life and deprive me of my phone, or something. That would be plain evil. “I’m gonna say that it’s not Cam’s party...?”   “What’s happened to your mom so suddenly, anyway; I mean, she used to not mind that you went to Cam’s, but now...suddenly...I don’t get it...?” I sighed at Jess, I’d explained it just yesterday, half crying, as I had just broken up with Freddie about three hours before; but she should’ve understood, by now. “Since Cam made friends with that Connor Wilson guy, she’s not liked him as much. That’s all.”    Jess looked a bit puzzled, “Connor Wilson, as in Edward Wilson’s son?”  I nodded, “Yeah, the Wilsons; the billionaire family that we hated since the dawn of time; although I’m not entirely sure why...?” a ghost of a smile crept onto Jess’ face, “Didn’t you say that it was because of something that happened about your grandfathers, or something?” I nodded, “Oh yeah, our grandparents used to be the best of friends, but then something happened, I think that Mr. Wilson had an affair with my grandma, but he’d kind of threatened my grandma not to tell my granddad about it. Then, when my granddad found out, he completely lost it, he almost killed his wife, but then Mr. Wilson told them the truth, scared that he might be killed too and moved to London or something and got married there and then moved to somewhere round here, like Port Angeles, or something, with his family ten years later when things had died down a bit; he died of lung disease, like, twenty years ago, and Connor’s parents and grandma had moved back here to Seattle at the same time as we did, and then we found out who they were, due to Edward Wilson looking just like his father. Granddad, having known the guy so well before he passed away, recognised Mr. Wilson as his ex-best friends son right away; and the fact that dad and Connors dad carried on the hate, but they had no reason to do so...so, I basically hate Connor and his family for nothing.”    “Wow! Really?” Jess was surprised, “I didn’t think you knew so much about your family’s history, but, apparently, you do!” I shrugged, “I didn’t even know that I knew so much, but, yeah, I do.”               “You’re sure that she’s going to be there, right? I mean, yeah it’s her brothers party but I’m never home when my sister has all her girlfriends round, right?” he looked at me, worried, I nodded reassuringly; she, Caitlyn, had told her friend yesterday outside Math, and I, luckily, had overheard her saying that she’d definitely be there on Saturday.    “You know, Connor, I think that you’re mad to like her; she’s so...bitchy...” he said the last word with caution, as he didn’t want to upset me, but it was okay, he’d soon see my way, I looked at him, “Don’t judge a book by its cover Matt, remember?”   He sighed, “I guess...but still...I don’t think that it’s right...” Connor sighed, “Stop it Matt, its fine, okay, I do like her...a lot, but I’m not crazy...I’m still not going to listen to you though. You know that.” Matt shrugged, I grinned, he knew that I wasn’t gonna give up any time soon. He looked at me curiously, “Why doesn’t your dad want you to go to Cams party?” I sighed, we’d been through this a hundred times in the last week, I was just gonna repeat it again and again all my life, well, until Saturday, anyway. “My dad doesn’t want me to go to Cameron’s party because he doesn’t like him, his sister, and mainly his sister’s friends. So he doesn’t want me to be friends with Cam because of that.” Matt looked confused, “What have Caitlyn’s friends ever done to you? I mean it’s not that Jess, Marie, Maddie and that Alyssa White girl can kill you, or something. ” I rolled my eyes, “It

He is tall and has an athletic figure. He has light gray eyes, similar to a husky's. His name is Cedric.   Any suggestions for his power?

20090131122131AAygN2S	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Confused about why Team Jacob even exists.?	I am not your normal Twilight reader considering I am 23 and male but I thought the stories were entertaining and made a pretty good light read.            I guess since I read the books because I enjoyed the supernatural world she created (except for glitter vamps which was pretty weak) as opposed to the central love story I feel I am pretty removed from the teams issue.  I couldn't help but wonder why Team Jacob exists though since Bella never really even considered Jacob...at all, other than a substitute for Edward and still only thought that she would be settling.         Anyway I was hoping some of you Team Jacob Fanatics could shed some light on the issue.  Also this is not meant as an insult merely an inquiry.

But really you should go. ” now heading with Bell, Brooke and Jake to her 6th period class. Leaving J.D. at his class.           As  they were walking down the hallway Brooke noticed that Josh the schools star football player was coming over this way.  “Hey Jake I’m still coming home with you Friday right ?” Josh asked standing right in front of Brooke, Jessica and Bell practically making them faint. “ Yah why wouldn’t you ? ” Jake replied  “Um . . . are they ok?” Josh asked staring at Brooke, Bell and Jessica.  All three of them were Google eyed and staring at Josh.  “Yah there fine Josh don’t worry there just so excited about math next period that they get a little weird.” Jake lied witch is something he hardly ever dose. “Well got to go Jake see you later.” Josh yelled back down the hall half way to his next class.  Then  Jessica looked at her watch and realized they were almost late for there next class. “ oh let’s hurry there’s two  minutes left till class starts” Of course as usual they were on time but barely.  The three of them sat down in the third row of the room next to each other.    “ so Jake how come Josh is coming home with you on Friday?” Brooke asked staring at the new poster Mr. Brown had put up.    “well if you must know Josh is my cousin.” Jake told Bell, Brooke and Jessica. Then Bell said looking around Mr. Brown’s room  “lets change the subject to this camping trip.”   Then Mr. Brown came up to Bell’s seat and just stood there while Bell kept on rambling on and on and on about the camping trip. “Um Bell I think Mr. Brown wants you to be quite.” Jessica said looking straight at Bell. “what makes you say that?” Bell asked not even bothering to look up. “oh I don’t know maybe the fact that he’s standing right behind you.” Brooke said now looking at Mr. Brown. “no he’s not.” Bell said turning around. And what do you know there’s Mr. Brown right there. “I think he’s mad.” Bell announced. “no really what ever gave you that idea” Mr. Brown asked. “well . . .” Mr. Brown butted in. “no I don’t really want an answer I just want you to pay attention.”

At this exact second,      Then I’d die knowing someone was always protecting me.      Keeping me away from the truth.      When the key to my life      Was the exact truth.

A smile spread across my face gently.      If I shall die today      Then let the sky withhold me.      The trees have already withstood me.      Is it good?   Would you read on?   Does it reveal to much?   What should I add?   What should I change?   </3 Thanks

Chapter One   “Is my beginning really my end?”            I blew the candle out the room suddenly became dark and cold. I lay on the bed what have I gotten myself into? I thought to myself. The answer was clear to me but I just didn’t want to believe it. I groaned and rolled off my bed making a loud thud on the ground.      “Hey what’s going on up there?!” Christian screamed up as he ran up the stairs busting into my room. “You don’t always have to worry about me” I murmured as I got off the floor and stood about 3 feet across from him. “Are you sure about that?” he smiled. “Shut up!” I yelled pushing him as he stumbled to the ground. “Violence is never the answer.” He laughed. “Says the man who -” he interrupted me “Who what? Charlotte this is a new life lets forget about the past.” He said rubbing his top forehead lightly pushing back his brown chestnut colored hair. “How can we forget the past when the past is here?” I yelled. “Where’s the past! Where is it?” he yelled even louder. “It’s right here.” I said pointing to myself. “I’m the reason we’re here I’m the reason you’re here and I’m the reason why.” I silently responded. Christian came to me and hugged me. “You’re definitely not the reason we’re here. They are” he said lightly.      Christian left the room quietly and I sat back down on my bed of my dark room. Although we weren’t staying long this felt like an actual home to me. Usually we stayed in hotels, motels, old apartments but this was different it was a beach house across the sand beach of Plum Island. It was beautiful and cozy. I always walk up and down the beach laying there at night thinking if we were ever going to leave this place of unnatural trauma and deep depression and when I say “this place” I mean this state of mind. The nasty disease that kills me whenever I see Christian’s sad face…guilt. I could have never dragged Christian along for these sad months. Don’t let it eat you up Christian would always say to me. I would solemnly respond quietly murmuring words I didn’t even know. But, although I’ve spent most of my life with Christian I still don’t know who he was or I still don’t know who he is. He’s mysterious and likes it that way. He doesn’t like people who know too much about him. He’s closed up in a cocoon like a butterfly waiting to emerge and be free. But I don’t think that will be anytime soon. You see Christian is my cousin he’s been with me ever since it happened. I love him so much because he’s like my only family. My family got injured in a fire their fine but after that they forgot about me then Christian took me in. I hated him for doing that but I started to love him as I progressed.      I walked down the stairs to see Christian his eyes planted on the TV screen. He wasn’t moving…not one movement. He’s probably trying to scare me.    “Not funny Christian.” I laughed he’s good but not to good. He still didn’t move. “Chris!” I yelled as I ran to him. I gasped at the unwelcoming sight. A knife stabbed in his heart blood pouring everywhere. No he’s not dead. “Christian YOU’RE NOT DEAD” I screamed repeating it over and over. I ran to the phone to call 911 but someone grabbed my waist.      “You really don’t want to do that.” The raspy and flat deep voice said turning me around strangling me. I tried to push away but I didn’t. Someone suddenly came behind him and pushed him to the ground. I looked to the couch. Christian’s body was gone. I stayed in a fear state of crying yelling and fussing as the figure grabbed me and flung me over his back running me out the house. “LET GO!” I shrieked. “LET GO!” I kept saying until we reached a black eclipse. The man who had strangled me was running out the beach house towards us. “AH!” I yelled. Behind the man was another man and woman with blood smothered on their faces. “NO!” I screamed as the man holding me fussed to open the car door. He finally got the door opened and pushed me inside making me land in the front seat.   This is the end. I thought as the man came into the driver’s seat and sighed. He looked at me confused and tired. “Your one heck of a girl.” He mumbled. I sobbed. He began to drive. The car was silent.      “I’m sorry.” The man mumbled. I looked up at him then at the window still crying.    “…I’m Adam.” He smiled. He had black hair and chestnut brown eyes.   “I’m…” I chocked on my words.   “I know who you are.” He smiled again.   I suddenly became safe, but I still missed…Christian.       What do you like or not like about it?   What's your favorite part?   Who do you like so far?   Thx</3

20081110192116AANe4US	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I forgot the name of Children's book about death of cat and a cat ghost?	I remember reading a book when I was younger ( I was born in 1991, It was  probably from maybe in mid 90's to early 2000's)      Summary- It was Fall and 2 kids, a boy and a girl, presumably siblings, were raking leaves and it showed the road. There were also 2 cats. I assume that one of the cats got ran over, but somehow one cat died. I then remember that at the end they saw the cat that was still alive jumping around like the two cats were playing together again like the cat that died was a ghost.      I was wondering if anyone could tell me he title if they remember a book like this. It was a paperback maybe 20 pages? It wasn't that long. I looked on the internet and couldn't find anything.      Or, if someone could find a list of children's books that involve cats and ghosts? ( I already checked amazon)      Thank you very much!! I would appreciate your answers!!!

20090131160108AAz71Cs	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you read my 2nd poem and tell me what you think, please?	I remain staring at the sunset   caught by the rays   with the dying days   where this infatuated misery does not end      There's a thousand miles between that can be traveled   A million seconds left to unify.   And yet,   I'm chained by an impious thread   as if by magic.      Too many memories    serve as remnants from the past   that only long the sunset   and keep me yearning   for the dawn      Time will eventually tick into twilight   And that's when I'll know   that I was lost in the end   but found in the start               In case you're wondering, I wrote this because I can't wait until I finally get over that 'someone'.  As of right now, the darkness is fading into light.  As I was stuck into sunset, I knew that a lot of distance and time will have to pass before I finally got over it, thus, "a thousand miles, a million seconds".  I hope that explains it.       Thanks!

I recently finished an acrylic painting on canvas with a coat of crackle medium, but it didn't behave properly (instead of creating cracks, it pooled about in drops like oil). I'm using the DecoArt brand of crackle medium, and completely dried my painting before I finished it. I have no idea what I did wrong.   Are there any other mediums/gels out there in art stores that give a good crackling effect, or other faux finish that you would recommend? Any regular glaze/fixative will work as well; I just want to make sure that I use a clear fixative on my other painting that will coat the canvas without giving it an unwanted texture.

The director has a deal where the understudies get to do one performance.      i love to perform and sing and dance, and I'm talented in those things, but I have one little problem.   I'm pretty insecure about singing in front of people. I can sing well when i'm with my best friends or family, but when I get in front of the cast, it's like I can't even sing loud. my voice becomes just plain ordinary and whispery. I feel like everyone is better than me and it makes it worse, like i want to hide my voice.      Even when I calm my body down [like, I don't feel nervous or anything] I still can't sing well and to the bset of my abilities!      What can I do!? what are some tips and tricks to boost confidence or sing louder but well?      Thanks, any help is welcome.      I'm afraid of screwing up in front of everyone.
20090131162957AAZGBdM	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Kissing in the musical, help!?	I'm in a musical where I am the lead character. There is a lot of touching and near kisses [and one actual kiss] with the lead boy in the play.      I've never really been a touchy person and so this is kind of awkward for me. I hardly know the guy and it's hard for me to be social so i haven't really gotten to know him yet.   I also don't hug people much [i'm just not touchy] and i've never kissed anyone before.    I know how to flirt [well], but It's hard to seem flirty with this guy because I don't actually like him like my character does in the play.      What can i do? i want to be comfortable with him and i want to have an attraction, but I'm not good at being social.   also, there is another girl who shares my role with me [we switch off days] and she is very comfortable with him and they look like they are actually a couple, so it makes it even more awkward for me when it's my turn.      How can i change and be better at this.      also, how can i not feel awkward kissing him and stuff?

I'm a Canadian grade 12 student who needs help on making an art portfolio for a few art colleges I want to attend. It says I'm to include 8-10 of my best art pieces in it. I have a charcoal drawing of one of Da Vinci's grotesques that I think would be good enough to include, however I'm not sure if I should include it because it doesn't really show my creativity, but more of my skill. I'm much better at copying things...like drawing a portrait of a person while looking at a picture, or still life...that type of thing. I find it very hard to come up with things that aren't there in the first place. Yeah...Do you think most art colleges would like to see charcoal or pencil self portraits?

20090131170507AANumzf	Arts & Humanities;History	Eastern Art History languages?	I will be applying to PhD track programs in Art History next year. I am torn between Eastern Art and Modern. I am intimidated by the languages I would have to learn for Eastern Art (focus on Japan).       What languages would be most relevant to the study of Eastern Art, aside from Japanese? Most art history tracks recommend German - would this be useful in the study of Japanese art (since early art history was primarily in German)?
20090131170856AA09sYE	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	New poem! What do you think?	I want to look you in the eyes  peek into your insides;  Strip you piece by piece  follow that tick  and learn about it.    I want to hold you and never let go  say the right things  Conserve you and savour you  Feel the warmth  and share with no one      You're mine to discover.      I'll always be yours to wonder.
