20090220170529AAxqJlh	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Will my home support this much weight?	I'm looking to move my business to my home. Its on the 2nd floor of a private house built in 2000 Its a room about 10ftx6ft.There will be a 100gallon fish tank that is 6ft long against the wall, one 75 gallon 4ft on the sidewall which is a false wall and and 2-33gallon tanks against another wall. I wish i could draw out some sort of diagram. it will be around a total of 300 gallons of water. Would it be ok to have these tanks in this particular room? I do not have any other places where i can keep this operation. I definitely would not be able to add supports on the 1st floor.      The certificate of occupancy says 40lbs per sqft. Any ideas?

20090220172002AA71SD3	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	I bought a house built in 1926 and it has a thin strip of trim about 6" from the ceiling. Is it electrical?	I have high ceilings, and about 6 inches from the ceiling there is a thin strip of trim running the perimeter of the room.  The (not-so-trustworthy) inspector told me that was the way they ran electrical back then, (so there is electrical in there??) but I am not so sure I believe him.  It looks like your standard "decorative" strip of trim, painted the color of the rest of the walls.  I want to fill in the gap with molding ...does anyone know if this could be covering electrical wiring?

I do not want a tub, but rather only a shower.  I am at the point of putting in the wallboard, and durarock.  My question has to do with the showerpan.  Should I durarock the walls the whole shower area first?  or should I put in the shower pan first, and then add the durarock to the walls??  Also, how should I put the durarock on the pan itself for the shower floor?  Or is there a better way to do it?  I guess my question is what is the order of steps I should follow?  Thanks for your time.      pb4sc

I heard yesterday some cheeping going on and a robin flying out of the hole.  I am guessing there is a nest in there with several newly hatched birds.  Problem is, the roofer we scheduled a while ago is coming tomorrow to fix the roof!  How can I move the nest and not endanger the babies?  And although my husband objects, should we tell the roofer to come by later?   He will not be fixing the hole right away, but we are getting a whole new roof and all the commotion will probably startle the mother and her young.  How long does it take for the babies to leave the nest?  I'm really worried.
