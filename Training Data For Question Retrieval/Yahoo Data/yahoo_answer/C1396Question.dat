20090308030102AAlO5Ih	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Have a lot of people on this forum?	Have a lot of people in this forum been abused or had a lot of bad experiences with the opposite sex?  It seems that a lot of women on here have been abused by their fathers, husbands or boyfriends at one time or another.  It also seems like a lot of men have been through this with women.  A lot of the men seem to be divorced, screwed over by an ex-wife or are struggling with custody rights of their kids.  I think some may have also been been abused by women when they were younger. Am I right?   Not everyone but it just seems like a lot of people on here have a developed a bitterness toward the opposite sex.  I guess they have their reasons.  I hope I never feel that way,  but I guess I could if I go through some of the same things.

He is my year co-ordinator and I've become really close with him over the past year because I've been going through some things with my family, and he has been talking to me alot about it and this year my friends have all been making jokes about it and how we're sleeping together because he helps me out alot (which doesnt bother me one bit because its all in fun and they know nothings really going on) but then about a week ago I had a dream that I was in a relationship with him and that we were sleeping together, I found this really strange and remembered it very clearly the next morning, then a few nights ago it happened again, I think that their comments are getting to me subconsciencly, but then again I'm concerned that it might be a sign that I'm getting feelings for him. What do you think?

20090308034126AAsH2f8	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this haunting dream mean?	It was raining and i was living in a large house with many people,it was like a school but the building was a classic manor.   The rain was so catastrophic(i didn't see it,they just told me)that a room that we forgot to close the window had gotten all messy.Me and a red haired boy with glasses looked at the mess and decided to leave it be.But just as i was going to walk out,he persuaded me to look carefully in the soil that covered the floor.I found the heads of three small squirells.   I felt very sad but not disgusted.Then the heads became real squirells and then they turned into three colorful plush dolls that looked like puppies.   But in the dream they weren't plush dolls.They were little dog corpses and we played with them sadly.   Just as we were going to throw them out of the window,they turned into female dolls.But in the dream they were dead children.I felt even more sad and tried to be sure if they were really dead or not.   I decided they really were dead and tried to leave them in the room,so i asked them one last time:are you dead?one of them moved and replied:no!   the other one did the same.   i hurried out of the room and asked my best friend who was waiting outside instead of the red haired boy what to do:leave the doll-children be or welcome them in the house?   she was very worried and tried to warn me to leave the children in the nature outside.I didn't know what to do so i asked for the protection of the headmaster of the school,that was a person from my art school in the dream.

20090308033450AAP73iu	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Guys and girls, come and put in your input?	Now I'm doing a little project for Gender Studies and it's based on the propaganda abstinence programs teach you. I'm decided to debate against their "facts" with my facts. I also want an opinion peace on them which is why I'm here right now. I'm going to take snippets from each abstinence program I looked up and see how you feel about them.      Example 1:      According to South Carolina, Heritage Community Services, males can't help but automatically think sexual thoughts when they see a woman showing skin and they can't help themselves. According to them, it's a woman's job to dress modestly and cover herself up so she doesn't send the man the wrong message because men only think sex when they see you. Other organizations like Teen Awareness, Inc. and Abstinence Education Consultants have this type of information themselves.      Question for the males, Do you think about pouncing on a woman just because she's wearing a mini skirt?      Example 2:      According to LifeGuard Youth Development, men are like microwaves. After 30 seconds they're ready to do it but women are different. Women need to hear words, recieve affection, and be romanced in order to be turned on because they are slow cookers. Pretty much men see sex as just something to do because they can't control themselves and women need to be romanced because when women think about sex, they see is as a personal intimate relationship.      Question for the males, do you think you're a microwave?   Question for the females, do you think you're a slow cooker?      Example 3:      A Positive Approach to Teen Health, Inc. says that girls only flirt to get attention. When a girl flirts it's because she's insecure and she feels flirting is the only way she feels she can get the boy's attention.      Question for the females, do you flirt for just attention?      Example 4:      Now the one that takes the cake is Missouri’s LifeGuard Youth Development that says that a girl who has sex is no more special then a rat who lives in a warehouse since rats have sex too. Pretty much they said girls who have sex are just like rats.      Question for the females, how do you feel about being compared to a rat?      Example 5:      Now I will leave with a parting gift and I'll give you both a quiz. This question is from Ohio’s ATM Education website.      Rochelle tells how she drove her drunken friend Jason home after the party, and then is raped by him. Jason denies that the rape happened, saying their sex was consensual. Monica and Tanner observe that Jason was being a drunken idiot the entire night, with Monica (Jason’s ex) adding her opinion that Rochelle has a reputation for “putting out” and being a “slut”.      The site then asks the question: “Based on all accounts, whose story sounds the least credible?”         Wanna know the answer?      Wait for it wait for it.........it's Rochelle because she's not as a slut?      Now how do you feel about this whole information that I have given?

Last nights dream was pretty cool, but I'm having a hard time with it.    I was with a person on a horse that i couldn't see but I knew it was there because I wanted to go to the riverbank and knew the horse could not walk down the incline over the tree roots. I walk down by the river which in my dreams is usually a golden color but this time it was clear water, because the life in the water had died. ( not eco system in the water).  I look both ways and there are bridges to each side down a ways, and a boat of people pulled to the shore, it startled me a bit , but they were just a flash, I remember the men had on either green or yellow t_shirts with something written on them, but I can't remember or see it. There was a frog in the water near the edge. only its eyes popping out of the water. I  got in and splashed out. the other person with me got out also and the frog hopped to the next level of tree root. I  thought oh that's good I don't have to get next to it so I walked around it. and when I did it gushed out this foul smelling silty pond water stuff on me and I woke up of course going  Ewww!

And I don't want to get into any arguments along the way. Then there's another friend, who is different in another kind of way.   So how do you say no to people you dont want coming along?

Take her certain places.      She was my first girlfriend, and i'm 19 now. We dated for a year. I've asked her to hang out multiple times, but decided to let her come to me, seeing how she ended it.      Was it wrong of me to not want to be her "fallback" guy?   I couldn't take it because i loved her so much, as i still do, but i just want to see her again.. I'm not sure if i'm seeking closure, but i need something, it's not just my heart, but my soul too..      Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

20090307221904AA0SiJ4	Social Science;Psychology	What does One do when they feel completely worthless?	Throughout my childhood, I have been through many things. Including child abuse, which made me, literally, afraid of my parents.      As I grew older I became depressed and I still am, but when I'm at home, I feel so depressed and then when I am at school I turn into somebody different. I am smiling all the time. But I am not really happy on the inside.      I don't know what I have done to deserve such a life like this? Why has God put me here, on this spot, on this certain state, on that certain year, of that certain day, if I am so miserable? Why? Am I supposed to learn a lesson from all this?      And the worst part of this is, tomorrow morning, I'm going to be happy. Then something is going to happen and I'm going to be all sad again. This is a never ending cycle in my life and I am sick of it.      My whole life, my family has been controlling everything I do. And I have done as they ask. Without complaints. Do the dishes, cook food, clean, get good grades, don't do drugs. But, the problem is: when my mother was younger, she had wanted to be a doctor, or nurse, of some sort. And she had never full-filled that dream of hers. Now, she wants ME to be that. But the problem is is that I don't want to do that. Because if I do something in the medical field, I know I won't like it. I have tried explaining to her many times that I just won't be able to do it. But she yells at me. I can't fight or talk back.      Maybe I just needed to vent. Sorry if I wasted your time. Sorry. But, if you're still willing to answer, what do I do with my life?   "What to do when you feel completely worthless?"

He's really shy and really cute, and I've been having these crazy rape fantasy dreams about him.      It was like the typical dominatrix and submissive scene; we were both naked, and he was tied up, and I was doing all this stuff to him: whipping him, slapping him, strap-on sex, and riding him cowgirl while he looked horrified and was moaning throughout the whole experience.      I feel like I'm naturally the powerful one as he's Korean and I'm white, and I'm an adult and he's still a kid; and something about his shy personality really turns me on. I really am dying to do this to him, but is he too young? I want to do it while he's still 17 because him being a kid makes it a lot more exciting for me.

The first part of the dream was my whole family at my house. They were in the front yard when my cousin confronted me about how I ruined her life. She kept saying the only reason I'm like this is because my mom took care of you instead and then you left her. (her mom took care of me for awhile then I left because she conned me out of 13,000 dollars). The house that I live at now is with my grandparents and thats where the argument took place. She kept trying to hit me put my uncles held her back. The next day I asked about her and then someone showed me a picture of her and her son.    Then my dream cut to my grandmother sending me downtown to the butcher to get some meat.  Then I end up in some ladys loft and then she discusses how much she loved my art (they were cut out figures and various other pieces) She praised it then offered my little cousin and I fruit. I look at the table where the fruit is and my sister is sitting there too! I kept trying to call my grandma but I think she got tired of waiting and left me because she wouldnt answer her phone. I ignored that. So I put a cut in half apple on my plate. It was a reddish purple color on the inside. and she kept talking about my art and how much she liked it. I remember the apple being extremely delicious. Then I woke up.   I am an artist and I'n in school to teach it.    What does this dream mean?? Thanks
20090308002823AAON2S7	Social Science;Psychology	What does this mean? Is it OCD?	I was with a girl in a very serious relationship but she did a lot of things that messed me around. I was very in love and we shared sexual relations. But when we broke up I was in a really bad frame of mind.       I made the error of going out and hooking up with girls to try and get over them, but then i decided it was a bad idea and it didn't feel right.      Something then clicked in my head and said "wtf you must be gay if you don't wanna hook up"   from then on i started fearing about my sexuality.      i'm seeing a psychologist and he believes i have OCD .    this gay fear all started when i was about 8. my dad said that having 3 sisters will turn you gay.   ever since then i guess i've had a fear of it. whenever my sisters said something about a guy i got anxious because i didn't want to agree.      Until this break up, i have had no doubt that I loved EVERTYHING about girls. Their bodies, and every complex part of girls that makes them , well, girls.       I had never had any thoughts about blokes. But when that thought clicked in my mind i suddenly was so sure i was gay. and my mind created a very good argument for it. I started putting gay thoughts into my head to see if i liked them. i was disgusted but i had to keep doing it to see if i was gay. eventually my mind started doing it more frequently, and i had to start fighting the thoughts (by had to i mean I just had to, it was constant). but eventually i got sick of it, it makes me depressed. so i gave into the thoughts and it's becoming more natural to think about guys in that way.      What am I supposed to do? Obviously I can't change my roots, if i'm gay i shouldn't fight it but it doesn't make sense. how do you turn gay?   Do i really have OCD? I find it so hard to believe because being gay is something that happens, it's not farfetched.      PLEASE HELP ME

20090308050755AAvaZFf	Social Science;Psychology	Am I a sociopath or evil or what?	I'm probaly not.   I killed animals as a child, mainly tadpoles, it was fun. I'd stab them with pins. I attempted to kill birds as a child, didn't work out.   I've been exspelled from many of school. A man said my goal didn't count so I punched him in the face loads of times and made him bleed.   I kicked a boy down the stairs. I smacked my water bottle into this annoying fat kids face. I stabbed a wire into this boys hand. I had a physical fight with my headmistress. I lead a group of morons in school   (I was the smartest of the group) I kinda kidnapped one of them. (nobody found out, I let him go). I love fire.   I'm a misogynist (so what?)   I can lie pretty well, i'm a good actor, It comes naturally to me.   I blackmailed this boy into an invite to his birthday.   I've participated in many sexual acts. One involing my friends small baby (I kissed her on the lips, I was 10)   Me and my friend took part in mutal *asturbation.   I sat on a girls back and dry humped her. (for 1 second and then she ran away, we were playing kiss chase)   I would bully. Annoy.   I had superficial charm, very manipulative. I would make up stories so often and my friends would laugh etc.   I lied to my family and psychiatrist and said "I have dreams about suicide" I started to cry.   I go this stupid retard pathetic dumbass school now, bunch of idiots.   One girl wants to go out with me and I think she's a joke. (stupid chav)   I harrassed this one hot girl who wanted to be my friend on msn,   and facebook. I said i'm going to kill her and made excuses about having problems.   I see people as sexual objects and nothing more, the end.

20090308052721AAHzLMw	Social Science;Psychology	A phobia that effects my life, makes me pass out. And yet, I don't even know why I have problems with it.?	It's not a conscious phobia at all, I don't think "eww" when I hear it. I just get light-headed, hot and finally I pass out if It's discussed around me.   If you're a guy you might want to turn away now, just a warning :P   Basically, when I think about or people discuss anything to do with the internal female reproductive system in detail, womb, ovaries, whatever it happens. I've passed out at many inconvenient times because of it, and I don't consciously have any issues with talking about it. I can't even use tampons because of it.   It's really only been a nuisance that arises very rarely up to now... but I've recently come up with some symptoms of Endometriosis - I don't QUITE understand what that is, because I pass out every time anyone goes into detail, but I know the gist of it. My problem is that I'm going to the doctor about it next week, and I'm fairly certain It's going to be a very unpleasant visit, for obvious reasons.   I was wondering if there's any way to conquer it? I mean I don't even know what's wrong with me! I heard that it could have something to do with something that happened when I was very young or before I was born... does anyone have any ideas how I can learn more about it? I'm actually more concerned about this than endometriosis! at least someone can... at least try, to explain to me how that happens (please don't explain it to me, I'll pass out >.>)

We went to his hospital room, and when we got in, it suddenly was my lil sister who was in the hospital bed.  She was giving me this smile as if she were ready to leave and I kept telling her to hold on.  It worried me so much I woke up crying lol.

It really scares me, I love my sister so much and these kind of dreams worry me a lot.  They said that dreams of dying actually means the opposite which is life.

I am in the process of writing an essay on social media for my university course, but am needing some quotes by users of some socializing sites - in this case, socializing means where one person can write/speak to another person using the technology of the Internet.      I am looking for a few positive remarks, and few negative remarks, so if anyone could write a small paragraph, or a sentence on their thoughts, I would be greatly appreciative.      I will give the best answer to the most helpful, and properly written quotes, eg, BAD: it is gud GOOD: I think that networks such as MySpace are a brilliant way of being able to communicate with some old friends I never thought I'd talk to again.      Thanks to everyone who replies, in advance.

I really don't understand how a person is supposed get experience if no one is willing to help them attain it. Basically many jobs ask for a certain amount of years of experience and it gets pretty tricky when you are trying to advance yourself and it feels like you can't. I have heard so many comments from people who seem to think that the individual person must be doing something wrong which I don't think is the case. I feel that the world is relying more on your ability to network your way into a job instead of hiring those with the most potential, capability and ongoing productivity within the given field. I would like to know any ones opinion on this?

Could our genes and traits be modified in a way causing imbalance in the Brain Hormones resulting us to become Gay/Lesbian or no longer have the same feelings towards a specific person such as a loved one?   Are we totally dependent on the Brain for who we are? Where is the Soul? I understand that our Soul is subject to the experiences that the Brain conceives as it acts as a Provider to the Soul. But it only took the Brain so long to actually reveal who we really are because as babies we knew just about nothing of ourselves... So i guess the real question should be are we The Brain or are we Souls controlling our Brain?
20090308075944AAVBLM3	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why do i Dream of this Boy so often?	he lives two houses away from me. I have met him once and spoke to him. Whenever i go outside i avoid him and the girl next door for no reason?   But the boy is so cute and i often think about him for no reason. One morning when i woke up, i heard voices outside of children.I thought he was speaking to my brother,until i ran down stairs and found my brother in the house.   I had a dream about him once,   and this night i had a dream of him coming over to my backyard with my best friends and i never came out of the house (which i never do)   and they told him i liked him and he was waiting for me and i never came out.      Why am i dreaming of him so much. Why do i even dream of him when i haven't thought of him in forever?      Is this a sign? could he be thinking of me? Or am i just being Paranoid?

A zombie is mindless and just operates on basic instructions from someone else. Sometimes you find guys who do something similar when they parrot feminist ideas about men being inferior to women. Is it fair to call someone with this mindset a zombie, or should we feel more sympathy for people who are simply naive?

20090308062421AAqHkQ6	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone explain this dream that I had three days ago?	The dream was about me try to send a yellow frog in the drain in the tub in my bathroom.  I'm not sure if the frog is male or female. After many attempts, the frog did not go down the drain. While it was still in the tub, I got a bucket of hot water and threw it in tub tub thinking it would get rid of the frog. But, it only got bigger and it started getting fangs. The fangs were on the bottom set of the frogs mouth with the sharp points pointing upwards. The frog chase me all over my house and at a store and I could not get away from it. I ended up back at my house and I got a mop stick from a closest in the kitchen and I stabbed it when it was in the family room. After I stabbed it, it got bigger and tentacles started to developed. I was scared even more and I hit it and somehow I got it in a bucket and it started to melt away in a green foam form. After that, the dream was over. Can someone explain this?       I went to dreammoods.com and look to see what it means. Don't give me answers saying go to dreammoods.com or anything from that website. I want your own interpretation.      You know, dreams have meaning to them. Every a person has a dream that can tell that person something. I don't want answers saying, it was just a dream, that dream don't mean anything, you should of not ate that before you went to bed, or you watch too much TV. I only want serious answers please.
20090308082622AAPws5W	Social Science;Psychology	What do I do when I get nervous?!?	I play the piano and have taken lessons for six years. The school I take lessons at holds semi-annual recitals and participates in the annual Festival (also called Federation) competitions in which the student plays two memorized pieces for a judge who scores their performance on a scale from 1 to 100. So, basically I have performances at least three times a year. With all the performing, you'd think I would get used to the nerves and be able to just get up there and play, but I get so nervous that I've come to hate performing.      The day before the performance, I do nothing but practice the songs I'm going to play, even though I'm usually well-prepared. The morning of, my internal alarm clock wakes me up at 7:00, no matter how late I went to bed. I can't eat anything, nor can I work on any homework or even think about anything else. I feel like I'm going to forget the songs if I do. My heart beats really fast all day. I hyperventilate on the way to the church. Then when I perform, I make mistakes that I've never made before, and so at Festival, my score will sometimes suffer. I had Festival yesterday and when I came out of the room, I was sweating bullets. My parents don't pressure me to do well or anything, but I'm so afraid of humiliating myself or not getting a Superior at Festival that I break down and end up screwing up more.      What do I do when I get really nervous like this?

20090308070855AAFga3U	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How have you gone so long without sex?!?	Before dating my girlfriend I am with now, I decided to take a break from dating and meeting girls which also meant no sex. I stuck with this for just over 2 years for reasons I do not want to go into.      During that time, when ever people asked me the last time i had sex, the majority looked at me like I had just told them I had murdered someone and asked 'how do you do it'?      What am i supposed to say in response to this question?! lol      What am I supposed to do?      I love sex, but needed some time to myself. But I was talking to my girlfriend about this last night and we were laughing.      During those two years, was I supposed to cease functioning? I was supposed to go crazy? Should I have acted some other way other than say...I don't know...living life?!      Do most people honesty need to have sex to function and succeed in everyday life? Because if that is the case, then everyone must be having sex, even my parents because I have not seen any abnormal signs yet, other than slight memory loss and they move slower. But I stupidly assumed that was down to old age. lol

20090308083146AA7TFNp	Social Science;Psychology	Help with my obsessive behaviour over ex-girlfriend, still so much in love?	The love of my life finished our relationship in the middle of January. I just can't get over this. I've been doing everything you're supposed to do in this situation..been trying to go out more, see friends and family, but none of it seems to be helping much. It has sent me into a severe depression, something i've suffered from on and off over the years.      The problem is, I can't seem to stop contacting her...asking her to tell me that she didn't make this decision lightly, trying to just get a kind word out of her, asking her to tell me she understands why this has hurt me so much. She's given me an angry, impatient, sarcastic kind of 'SORRY!', and has asked me to leave her alone.      I know it's wrong of me to be doing this...but when i'm at my most low, I just can't seem to help myself. I miss her so so much, and I don't know how to just 'switch off' the feelings of love I have for her, although I wish I could. I know i'm just hurting myself by mailing or texting her, and I know this must read as if i'm a total psycho.      I started taking antidepressants a week ago, and have applied to have some counselling. I just can't see how I can stop loving her. I can't see myself being with anybody else, she seemed so perfect for me. It was a distance relationship, but it was worth the hard work involved as far as I was concerned.      I know I can't 'win her back', much as I wish I could...so I just want some advice on how to stop loving her, and how to stop this horrible obsessive behaviour that I know is so wrong. I know that if the situation were reversed, i'd be doing anything I could to help the person whose heart i'd broken through it, and I guess I can't understand why she won't just try to make me feel a little better about all of this, but she's obviously made her decision about this.      I know i'm going to get a lot of replies to this just telling me to stop being such a psycho, which is fair enough...but please, some constructive advice on how to move on from a relationship break-up where I never stopped loving that person would really be appreciated.

20090308090630AAsyi34	Social Science;Psychology	Why does my friend call my guy more than she calls me?	She and him go to the same school (right by where we live), apparently. So they run into each other pretty often. But why the hell is she calling him at 11 and 12 at night some nights? She has a tendency to exclude me from things intentionally or unintentionally. Like, she and the rest of the "crew" tend to go out to parties and stuff, and they tell me nothing about it. Even when she tags along with me and this guy I'm seeing, she doesn't call me about it. And now he'd tell me like "yeah, she called me...I don't know why, I didn't pick up."      She doesn't even call ME that much. So why the hell is she calling him? Even if she called him to invite the both of us somewhere, I don't understand why she's calling him (just met him like 2 months ago) and not me (just met 12 years ago). What do you think?
