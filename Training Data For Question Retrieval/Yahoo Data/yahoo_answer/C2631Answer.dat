hv8LeJ1Kaa	Les deux sont issus du raffinage du ptrole brut.  D'un point de vue technique, la diffrence vient de la combustion dans le moteur : l'explosion dans le moteur diesel est provoque par la compression du gasoil dans le cylindre. C'est pour cela qu'il est ncessaire d'avoir une bougie de prchauffage sur les moteurs diesel qui permet d'augmenter la pression au dmarrage. De ce fait, le gasoil ne s'enflamme pas naturellement  l'air libre, mme en prsence d'un flamme.

KPiBMYHGaa	I don't own 1 of these, and i haven't worked on 1 either but changing the oil is the same on most cars. You might want to add a engin flush before this. Jack up the car and slide under it, look for the oil sump, it will look like the bottom of a small fuel tank wit a bolt in the centre. There might be a plastic guard under the engine blocking your view, if so remove it. Place a bucket under the bolt and loosen the bolt. Once removed the old oil should flow out. Remove the oil filler cap to speed up the process. This would also be a good time 2 replace the old oil filter. Once the sump is drained put the bolt back in the sump and put in the new oil filter and replace the plastic guard. Let the car down and fill with new oil (about 5 litres). Make sure you dont put 2 much in. Use the dipstick to check the oil level. Thats it, best of luck.

The reason there is a surplus of cars - and no one is buying - is because what they are producing doesn't meet the public demand. And they are producing too many cars. There just isn't the demand for that many high powered, high priced vehicles. <br>  Instead of bailing them out, they should be forced to sit down and re-tool, to generate more efficient cars, cheaper cars and cars that people want to buy. <br>  Bailing them out just encourages them to continue doing what they are doing. Yes, some workers will have to be laid off if the production is cut back, but that is going to have to happen somewhere along the line. Either that, or the government is going to have to continue bailing out the car manufacturers - and as the government gets all its money from taxes, that means the public is paying for the car manufacturers to continue overproducing.

PR1JaFWfaa	The clicking noise is called a solenoid.  It is a device that pushes the starter gear into the ring gear on the flywheel to start the engine.  It clicks because when it is energized it goes forward (click) and conects the starter to the battery.  Then, in your case, there isn't enough voltage to maintain the solenoid in this position and run the starter.  Sometimes it may click many times, like a new-years-eve noisemaker.<br>  <br>  If your battery has a removeable top, verify that there is water in each cell.  Your starter or its connections could be bad, but it seems more likely that you jumper cables are too small, or the connections weren't good enough to start the car.  Put the battery on a charger overnight (4 amp minimum charger) and try again.  Then check the voltage on the battery with the engine running, preferably at a little above idle speed.  It should be around 14 volts.  About 13.5 to 14.3 is OK.  If you don't feel up to using a voltmeter, some auto parts stores will do this for free.  I only takes a minute, and will verify the charging system.|`|GP1KPyekaa	yea i 2nd what that guy says can you hear the starter roar? like the fan spin of does it click against the gears, neways if it is the starter or not you can always jack the car up pop of that starter its 2 bolts and your local autozone will test it for you <br>  <br>  good luck|`|kp3C2iIlaa	the black (negative) cable on your battery probably just needs to be tightened on to the terminal better.  if this doesnt help, try cleaning your terminals or look for other loose wires.  if THAT doesnt help, it could possibly be your starter.|`|AA10736285	With a GM vehicle, check BOTH side post connections for looseness AND corrosion.<br>  <br>  If everything checks out, check voltage drop to the starter...<br>  <br>  If THAT checks out, you could be looking at a bad solenoid/starter package|`|EmgiGg17aa	Should have saved some of that money for a starter repair.

r0FkeXtVaa	Auto trans gears change at specific Engine speed and road speed and it can be adjusted to different speeds. You should have the Trans Throttle cable checked for movement and proper adjustment. It is a very simple task and should not take more than 10-15 min. If you want to do it yourself then check the throttle where the Accelerator cable is attached, you will see another cable that is attached and its other end goes down towards the Transmission. Adjusting this cable will change the speed that your trans changes gear. Shortening the cable length makes it change sooner and making it longer makes it change later. Also check that the cable moves out and pull back in freely.|`|zruhNGKbaa	At 35 mph on level road your transmission will select high gear, but the slightest upgrade or throttle increase at that speed will prompt the transmission to downshift. this is normal operation, if you can not avoid traveling right at that speed and load condition and speeding up is not an option simply select the next lower gear using the transmission shift lever.  This will prevent unnecessary shifting and wear in the transmission and provide the additional torque necessary to maintain the vehicle speed. Just remember to return the selector to D when you can resume normal highway speeds.|`|fd7190dbf41367abef107c3ae34b04cbaa	could be a few things  vacum modulator not doing its job  vacum not getting to the tranny to tell it to shift or a solinoid in the tranny not allowing it to shift. have a mechanic check your computer  oh doees a light come on on the dash a trouble light?|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Yes, you have slippage between your gears.

AA10582974	http://www.acerbis.com/p106_handguard/13...  Go to - Mounting Instructions   4 is a rubber insert that fits exactly inside of the handlebar (same diameter).  When bolt  3 is tightened, it pulls nut  5 and it squishes the rubber insert  4, causing it to expand (bunch up).    Screw bolt  3 in a few turns and hit it with a hammer to push nut  5 away from the rubber insert  4 - then remove bolt  3  Rubber insert  4 is bunched up and probably corroded to the inside of the handlebar.  Grab the end of it with a pair of pliers.  Pull it enough to jam a long screw driver into the handlebars.  Spray WD-40 or contact cleaner into the channel the screw driver blade is making.  Repeat in a couple of spots (positions on a clock face 12:00 - 3:00 - 6:00 - 9:00).  Twist and pull the insert out.

Can I stick one or two jet engines to the top of it?  I guarantee 10.000 hp Easy.|`|bec14c0c3c2311c1dfe85797e3b59982aa	yes they can all get 1000hp. Easily? not so much. If your talking potential the Supra and GTR both have the advantage of being 6cyl with larger displacement.     Top Secret and several other companies (and some private owners) have reached the 1000hp benchmark with both cars, but not without tearing down the engines to the bare block to be reworked, replacing the internals, and doing lots of headwork. It's not a simple process and more often than not ends in trial and error, as when you're running that much boost the amount of things that can fail increases exponentially. And if you're wanting to pay someone to do it for you, better choose what organs you can do without because you're gonna have to sell something...    As for the STI, I believe there are only few with high HP, as the work and cost involved in bringing it to those numbers is not cheap or uninvolved (even more so than the either the Supra or GTR).
5e8bfd4f40a66f73272a2b251c8d304daa	No, you cannot ride a 125cc moped.  This is because there is no such thing as a "125cc moped".    The word 'moped' refers specifically and solely to the engine capacity i.e. less than 50cc.  So, as you can see a "125cc moped" does not exist.    What you are referring to is a 125cc scooter.  A scooter is simply a style of bike and does not refer to the engine capacity in any way.

c48nm70gaa	Don's right on the money. Excessive clearance between the valve stem and the crappy machined hole in the cast iron cylinder head is most likely out of specification. This clearance is usually between .013 on the intake valves and .016 on the exhausts. As they wear oil gets sucked down the guides when ever you start the car and during deceleration. Very few of any automotive or truck applications had standard neoprene valve seals.    There is a very good repair for the ignorant Detroit designed cylinder heads. The old sloppy cast iron guide holes are machined out and new hardened steel or phosphorous bronze material guides are pressed back in. A valve job must follow to true up the concentricity between the new guide and the valve seat.    Replaceable valve seals involve machining the top of the valve guide for the seal to snap onto. They don't solve the important issue at hand at all. It's a band-aid approach at best.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	If you are not having to add any oil between changes, don't be concerned with it.|`|7274403b2b4f83ec6c150a8f7b80a02aaa	Valve guides and/or guides.|`|lMIrbwifaa	HI  sounds like valve guide seals... when these go bad the oil that's in under the valve cover seeps down the valve around the seal when the motor is off and cause smoke at start up.  good luck  tim|`|hah4QjZKaa	If it is white smoke it is just water vapor that has condensed on parts of the exhaust coming out. Almost all cars have this when they first start up in cold weather.  If it is blue, there could be minor oil leakage problems - valve stems or rings - but it doesn't sound like it if it goes away after the engine warms up. One way to be sure is to have a pressure check of each cylinder.|`|c98d19a7cdd97887ad85f5b8a06892d4aa	Don W is correct the others don't know what they are talking about|`|AA11397003	burning oil ?

If it only takes it for a couple of minutes and stops and shows a full charge then the battery is dead, you need a new battery. Another thing have you checked the battery water level recently? Batteries will die and fail in no time at all if you don't have (distilled water in them) water in them, tap water will work but they have trace minerals in them that will lead to fluffy white stuff on your terminals. (acid reacting on the trace metals) and eroding your terminals. Most new sealed batteries have two oblong disks running on top of it. Prop them off with a screw driver and look inside. Distilled water should come up near the top. If not you are low on water and the battery will soon self destruct. Mind you there are permanently sealed batteries out there. No way to fill them, you need a new battery.|`|06cebaa8be6c7b7aa453981d739ec204aa	A bad battery or something that is draining it.

hcGUKAYFaa	yes, you need to fill the system, to do this, you need strong arms and a helper!!  the first step is to fill the power steering reservoir, then with the engine OFF slowly turn the steering wheel from lock to lock back and forth SLOWLY!  while a helper watches the fluid level and tops it off as it goes down, when you have done this several times (you are probably tired now!) start the car, and repeat the same back and forth full lock to lock slowly, return the wheels to straight, let the car idle for a few minutes, verify fluid level, and your good to go.  (i hope you didn't drive it dry for too long, you can destroy the seals in your new rack!)

hcGUKAYFaa	this could get quite complicated! the issue is defined as a load problem, when you are in neutral(or park) there is no load on the engine, so it revs up fine, but when you put it in gear, the transmission applies a load to the engine, and it cant cope.  the first things to check are the intake tract/vacuum system.  make sure there are no vacuum leaks, i have seen big tears in the rubber hose between the mass air flow and the throttle body that open up when the engine is under load, but any significant vacuum leak can cause this, the other possibility is a bad Throttle position sensor, start there, and email me if you need more help
Bl9zcqxQaa	Call your local dealer and ask, most service reminder lights are for emission control part replacements at certain mileage.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	Smart things that came with the car that should stay in the car:  *spare tire (remember to check its tire pressure every so often!)  *emergency tire jack and tire iron  *owner's manual and manual supplements    Here's a good listing of some other stuff that you should carry in your car:  http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/...    But for my listing:  *first aid kit (bandages, alcohol wipes, etc.)  *simple tool kit (multifunction tool, a pair of pliers, vice-grips, and a few differently-sized screwdrivers (flathead and phillips), a working flashlight or torch lantern, and a bungee cord or two)  *notebook and pencil (pens dry out or won't work when cold or leak when hot), to help you jot down the other car's information if in an accident for insurance purposes, or for writing down your maintenance history or your fuel log  *phone numbers of your auto insurance agent, your dealer, and any auto service club you belong to  *your cell phone and hopefully its car charger  *tire pressure gage  *combination portable jumpstart kit (with traditional jumper cable leads) with air compressor (and preferrably also with an emergency lantern/hazard lights)  *bottle of extra windshield washer fluid (especially needed in the winter to keep your windshield clean of dirty slush!)  *small blanket or mylar wrap (to keep you warm if necessary, but more commonly to cover/separate your stuff)  *box of tissues  *small trash bag to collect stuff (like used tissues)  *emergency reflective triangle or flares  *cloth rags (to wipe up big stains, or to clean bird droppings off the paint, or for when you check the oil or to wipe your hands...)  *extra set of old clothes (including shoes/boots), just in case you get your shoes/socks wet in weather, or have a messy time eating out, or you suddenly find yourself having to stay overnight somewhere when you didn't expect it...  *a bottle of water or two, and some long-lasting snackfoods (like nuts or a powerbar or jerky) in case you are stuck in your car somewhere...    and depending on the season and where you travel:  *good quality combination snow brush and ice scraper (hopefully strong, so it won't break from scraping and extended use, and preferably with the ice scraper on the opposite side as the snow brush, to prevent you from scratching your paint while clearing snow)  *portable folding shovel (in case you need to dig out your car from the plows or fallen snow, or if you're in a ditch)  *tire chains|`|lgjIwUftaa	an extra coat with a hood, warm mittens or gloves, a blanket, knit hat, warm boots. The key is to stay warm. Put them in a plastic bag in your trunk so they stay clean and dry. I hope u wont need them !|`|HlozHgwIaa	First Aid Kit  Blanket  Extra clothing  An emergency road kit (flares, tow cable, can of fix-a-flat, triangle, HELP sign, jumper cables)  Flash light  Tool kit (Wrenches, sockets, screw drivers)

3MTYGEbWaa	You get a normal used car loan and the payment depends on the length of the loan, the amount you are financing, any down payment you make, and your interest rate (which depends on your credit score). Look at the purchase price in your lease contract and use that amount to play around with the numbers in a loan calculator. Here's a calculator:    http://www.autoloancalculatoronline.com    .|`|AA10788612	Depends on the balance & how long you want the loan to go. Your question is vague & needs to be a little more detailed.
1OmSZUvLaa	I would check rate options on both a weekly rental, and the period you actually need the car.  Compare the totals, including all taxes and surcharges.    I suggest going to a booking site, like Travelocity, where you can compare several car rental companies at once. Once you find the cheapest company, try going to their website directly to see if they have any specials or deals that will give you a lower rate.  You can also try to use a discount code, if you have one.      There are hundreds of membership programs and professional associations that offer car rental discount codes to their members.  You can find a list of car rental discount codes for 8 major car rental companies, at http://www.best-car-rental-tips.com/disc...|`|OZFhyEw4aa	Why dont you just google it yourself?

She probably did lie, a "touch" like that would not cost that much from my knowledge. Im only 15 so i don't know about insurance though i do know it through AON but your obviously not with them ;). Let me help cheer you up. Well, usually when im sad/depressed i watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BxymuiA... (its awesome. you probably have seen it if you watch the discovery channel. So, i have a blonde joke and i do not mean to offend you if you are a blonde. What are 3 things similar between a blonde and a tornado? They both suck and blow and eventually you lose your house. (again did not mean to offend you) Man, the shovelling was brutal today.

Well, i hope i helped. excuse the random crap i wrote. i was trying to get your mind off your troubles.    Trevor  P.S the lady in the other car probably is a beeootch   lol ;)|`|7HKTDcvYaa	It would be insurance fraud for each of you and the other party to keep from the insurer the fact that you hit this other vehicle.    In general insurance rates may or may not go up immediately, depending on whether you have a first accident free policy, but in reality you will hav used up that first accident, so it does cost you.  It will be that much longer before you get to be accident free for 6 years, and that is an important threshold.    Be glad you did tell your insurer about this. Failure to do so can work against you for a long time.|`|j3f8m6REaa	Thank your lucky stars your dad has State Farm. They have an army of claims adjusters, appraisers and lawyers that will handle the whole mess for you. yes, the rates will go up but not as much as you may think -- certainly not 6K!|`|8NZC6LsRaa	She's overreacting. I highly doubt it will be 6,000. thats a little extreme. I got into a fender bender today and the woman absolutely freaked out (even though I only put a tiny almost unnoticable dent in her car). Don't worry, that is why you have insurance. Just call them and make your own claim. Don't worry about her right now...she will contact your insurance carrier when she wants work done to her car. They will call you to verify facts and also to hopefully get your side of the story. What can you do - it was an accident! It happens all the time! You offered to give her your information but she wanted the police involved. SHe really is going about it the hard way and she is going to have to do a lot more to try to get money out of your insurance. She has to get three estimates and do all of the calling. As long as you have a reasonable policy and you've never been in an accident before, State Farm should cut you some slack. It will probably go up, but that just comes with the situation dear. Sorry that happened to you. Just try not to worry, these things work themselves out.|`|bb6f5c98e5ad6a19b9c7b09e398b2418aa	Not real clear. Were you listed on your dad's policy, if so, the insurance should pay, but the rates will go up.    If you were not listed on the policy, you should contact the other party and make up a payment schedule.  I assume the 6,000$ was to the other vehicle.  If not, I do not know if your dad's collision would pay or not.  If you do damage, you either pay with higher premiums or pay from your own pocket.  Good luck.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	A car is just a thing. A thing can be replaced, rebuilt or repaired. You cannot be replaced or rebuilt (despite what the Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman say). I'm sure your dad cares more that you were not hurt more than he cares about a thing. Yes his rates will go up, by how much no one here can say since no one here knows how your dad is currently rated. However eventually his rates will come back down. as to the amount she is claiming no one here has seen the damage so $6,000 might be accurate, it might be out to lunch. However this is not your concern, as your insurer will work with the other insurance company to determine what is a proper amount to repair the damages. Do not talk to this woman anymore (unless you know or work with her), and if she calls again just give her the name/number of your adjuster and hang up.

AA10265913	In reality its not over miles for the year.  Being a 2007, it could have been sold in mid 2006.  Typical mileage average is 15K a year.  I would say its right on.

Also, the Dodge Caravan got a brand new design the following year so that only adds to the entire depreciation factor.  Go for it. My family bought a 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport in 2000 for $14,500 and it had 42,000 miles on it at the time! But since the MSRP was $28,500, you can see the deal we were getting..
VuIxxJvqaa	I'm assuming you mean a BOLT.    You have a few options.    First and foremost, spray it with a penetrating oil. Your hardware or autoparts store will recommend one for you, if you tell them what you are doing. Spray it every 4 or 6 hours and leave it for a day or two, the longer the better.    You should also brush it with a wire brush, to remove as much rust as possible. If you can, brush both sides, as in front and back.    Now, once you do that, you can try a few things to get it out.    Depending on the size of the bolt, some of these things may not work. One way also needs a specialist tool, which you may not have, but may be able to borrow.    What I would do would be to find a old socket that fits it and force it on with a hammer. Once you do that, you need whats called a Impact Driver. Connect this to the socket and hit it a few times with a hammer and you may loosen it enough to wind it out.    Or, if you have access to a air ratchet, or air gun, give it a few blasts with than and see if it comes off.     You can also try just using a normal ratchet, the trick is to make small, quick powerful whacks, to shock it off, rather than lots of force over long periods. If you can put a breaker bar on it, it will help more, also try putting a bar over the ratchet to extend it and make it as long as possible, so you need less force.    Or, grab a hacksaw and try cutting a slit into the head of the bolt, so you can put a large screwdriver into the slit and try and wind it out that way.    Another option is to grind the head off, then wind the remaining stump out with a stud remover, or locking pliers.     Good luck!|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Often times you can center punch it and give it hell with a reverse drill bit and it will back out - even if it doesn't, you'll be half way there to drilling the damned thing out.

Install it, run the system, drive around for a week or 2, and see if the car acts more sluggish or you get any severe power shortages or lights flickering.    I ran a 1200 watt amp and 2 12 inch subs in my mustang, and never had problems, except my crappy wal-mart batteries kept draining(due to a bad ground connection)  But i had a 135 or 155 amp Alternator in that car, and never had lights flickering even with the car off!      Im guessing a 105 amp alternator might not hold up too well....just a guess.    Like i said, if you get power draining or the car has lost some power, i would get a bigger alternator and maybe get a new battery if your current one is Cheap Brand or Old at all.  Also, if the system isnt as loud as you expect it to be, that could be a clue....(also bad wiring job could cause that too)      I knew a dude that was running over 2000watts in his Cavalier and i THINK he upgraded his Alternator...not possitive.

LbEGDUX0aa	You could use aluminum tubing if you wanted to. It doesn't have to be very thick. .060" thick tubing should be more than thick enough. If you can, find a fabrication shop to bend the tubing. Most muffler shops have benders that crimp the tubing as it's bent. A good fab shop will have a mandrel bender that doesn't hurt the tubing at all.|`|bvCkplELaa	I dont know what grade or thickness but I doubt a muffler shop can do this unless its at least 1 1/2" diameter or larger.

WKvIkH2eaa	no way. if you are only buying one of these amps it wouldnt. the amp at 4 ohms puts out at max 500 watts x 2 channels but the RMS power rating is 175 watts x 2 channel. so no it would kill the subs. i would recommend getting the http://www.crutchfield.com/p_575T6002P/R...    i have two powering much better and bigger subs than you have!|`|PRk77nm2aa	As long as the amps RMS power ouput falls within the sub(s) RMS power handling you should be fine.

6a07aef8ae11f45ec22092e56c9d0813aa	I didn't believe it when I bought my xB last May, but dealers have to sell the Scion at the listed price.  They can get in trouble with Toyota if they discount a Scion.  Even paying cash doesn't buy you anything.  There isn't much markup and the xB is a lot of bang for the buck.    You might find a low mileage 2008 demo and get a discount, plus there are some other factors that may help.  My dealer is giving me a 20% discount on parts for the first year of ownership, so I've bought several accessories and installed them myself.  Also watch out for packs like "paint sealant", "upholstery protectant" and "VIN etching" that just boost dealer profit.    You shouldn't have to pay to have a vehicle transferred from another dealer, but it will have some mileage on it when you get it.    The '08 is a completely different design with more slope to the windshield, so fewer problems with cracked windshields.    Check out my favorite xB2 site http://www.newscionxb.com|`|hMzG7HgGaa	well u would not be able to get any discount on any scions unless its a used one.  if u go to ur nearest dealer and tell them ur preferences on ur xB, they should be able to get it from another dealer. and their will be NO charge for it.   :)|`|XH4O3ozFaa	You cannot get 1 penny discount as they are pure priced.  You can get what you want by dealer locating car and trading for it.  No extra cost. There are no incentives ion a Scion.  It is cheapest quality car made in world.  the price is only 300 over invoice and if they discount they could lose franchise. As far as winshield i never heard of that in all years Scion sold.|`|49aV4RdEaa	they will not reduce the price. ive tried before they wont even do $50 dollars. but at least they wont jack up the price like other car dealers so if you see the price. its pretty much what you'll get anywhere else.|`|ZUn6937kaa	Most dealers use the manufactures suggested retail price as their sales price, but a dealer can actually set the price of a Scion at any price they want to, but THEY MUST SELL EVERY ONE OF THEIR NEW SCIONS AT THE PRICE THEY SET AND PUBLISH.     There isn't any haggling, no special prices for special people. All of a particular model goes out the door at the current price published by the dealer.    Keep in mind that the "standard published price" may not be the same, dealer to dealer, so it can pay to do a little bit of checking around between dealers for prices.    Hope that helps!

It is not opening when it reaches the proper temperature.  But once it gets hotter than it should it does finally open.  Which allows the coolant to flow through the radiator which allows temperature to drop slowly.  Until the thermostat closes again and the temperature increases again.  Change your thermostat.|`|AA10736285	Air bubble trapped in the cooling system.<br>  <br>  Have someone service your cooling system then evaluate it to see if there is anything else.
XLXncQu9aa	No.  These plane crashes have been because of one of two reasons.  Of course we all know about the crash that happened earlier this month.  The plane crash in the Hudson river occurred because allegedly a flock of air fowl flew into the direction of the plane and one of the birds was sucked into the engine causing it to fail.  So that was a freak accident but there have been many instances when birds were to blame for plane crashes.  Secondly, many crashes occur because of engine failure or technical difficulties.  However here is some information that proves that a lot of the crashes occur because of pilot error.  <br>  <br>  In the decades between the 1950's and the 2000's period 50% of airplane crashes were accounted for as it relates to pilot error.  <br>  <br>  22% crashes have been blamed for mechanical error. <br>  12% blamed for weather related issues. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.planecrashinfo.com/cause.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.planecrashinfo.com/cause.htm</a>|`|m8f7rnBEaa	You are hearing about them because the news media loves to report on suffering, misery and horror.  I do not know if they are cutting corners, but it would not surprise me in the least.  I know that a lot of aircraft maintenance has been outsourced to "low cost geographies".  Don't try to tell me it's safe to fly. I was on a plane that almost went down when one of the 2 engines disintegrated 10,000 feet over Detroit.  I was on another one that taxied out to the runway and was ready to take off when they turned around and went back to the terminal.  We had to disembark on the tarmac.  When I got out, the mechanics had the engine in pieces scattered all over the ground.  I once saw a mechanic take a solid hour to replace a light bulb on the landing gear.  He must have gone back and forth from the plane to the terminal 10 times before he finally found the right wrench.|`|FsVZCk0laa	The only one I've heard of was that one that crashed in a lake somewhere.<br>  And that had nothing to do with cutting safety. The pilot was being lazy and using the auto-pilot, or something.|`|DV4xyeChaa	maintenance has nothing to do with the hudson river crash...bird strike<br>   flying is very safe<br>  no comerical crashes in USA for over 2 years...<br>  many crashes from pilot error|`|AbAz2bqkaa	one was herrofic and came before that one

Sin embargo ahora hay muchos autos parecidos en el mercado. Mi mejor consejo es que pruebes manejar varios. En las agencias te permiten hacer esto, de lo contrario estas en tu derecho a cambiar de agencia. Tambin debers de tomar en cuenta los costos de reparacin. Lamentablemente los volkswagen son un poco ms caros en sus servicios, comparados con los japoneses.

AA11252292	Effectivement cela depend de l'utilisation que tu veux en faire en termes de distance de trajets. Mais honnetement, meme si un litre de diesel t'amenera un peu plus loin qu'un litre d'essence, ca fait longtemps que la difference de prix entre les deux carburants n'est plus assez substantielle pour justifier l'achat d'une voiture diesel. En achetant une essence, tu gagneras a l'achat et puis ensuite tu t'y retrouveras tellement en termes d'agrement de conduite que tu n'y repenseras plus a ton diesel. Fais toi plaisir dans tous les cas!|`|d250a8821c0387bd1ffa45baff06f180aa	Ricky, les moteurs essence dpassent allgrement les 200000 km quand on les entretien correctement : j'ai eu une Ford Orion 1.6L que j'ai lache  280000 km et dont le moteur tait encore en pleine forme (c'tait le reste, quasiment tout d'origine, qui partait en lambeaux !). Actuellement, j'ai une SuperCinq essence qui doit avoir dans les 250000 km et qui marche encore bien, et un 806 2.0L essence qui a 230000 km...    S'il est vrai que les anciens diesel, peu pousss, taient robustes (j'avais encore rcemment une BX 1.9D de 345000 km, dont le moteur tournait comme une horloge), les nouveau HDi, TDi et autres sont tellement pousss qu'ils sont de plus en plus fragiles? Et quand ?a tombe en panne (vanne EGR par exemple) ?a co?te cher...    Pour en revenir  la question, si tu fais peu (disons moins de 10000 km par an)  mon avis une petite essence est trs bien, surtout d'occasion (les diesels sont surcots). Le seul avantage des diesels modernes est leur faible consommation (mais faut relativiser, les moteurs  essence modernes  injection 16 soupapes consomment relativement peu : ma fille a une Fiesta 1.3 16 soupapes, 70 CV, et elle consomme dans les 6 litres...)    L'cart de prix entre le gasoil et le super devrait encore se rduire, c'est un simple artifice fiscal : hors taxe, le gasoil co?te plus cher que le super... En Grande-Bretagne, par exemple, il est plus cher que le super...|`|b58f9420cb8053da4bfeccd935a0c761aa	Tout dpend ce que tu vas faire avec cette voiture...

En effet, il y a de nombreuses pices qui ne se changent pas sur une voiture diesel et qui ne tiennent pas  la vie entire de la voiture sur une essence, genre la ligne d'chappement...  De plus, avec le diesel, tu auras une voiture bcp plus agrable  conduire, confortable en fonction du modle ( je conseille Opel  tout point de vue...!! )  les voitures essence sont trs nerveuses...
