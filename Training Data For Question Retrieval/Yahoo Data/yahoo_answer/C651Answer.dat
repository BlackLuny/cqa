AA11447210	On frostwire you can pull files from other people, and they can pull files from you (if you allow it). If you don't want that, you need to set your preferences to no sharing.<br>  <br>  What does this have to do with Singles & Dating?

kov7p4Y8aa	Sounds nice, but the comment about the speech contest could say something that maybe he's just a little too far through roof with confidence. However<br>  If you want to impress him, and you really do have a great personality<br>  Tell him you like him, that act of putting yourself out there might attract him cuz of the anti-shyness of it.<br>  But only do that when you think you can be comfortable with it to pull it off.<br>  Which may take time.<br>  Good luck :)|`|zrUbBiFdaa	if you like him or show a little bit of interest in him, go for it. life is boring if you don't ever take risks|`|pSicXtlVaa	Tell him, he'll probably be impressed that your trying to be less shy|`|HC6rrHLDaa	I think you should try it out anyways. The only bad thing that can happen is that you guys just weren't meant to be.|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	idk. maybe give it some time..|`|pOfOdldnaa	I'm shy too, but with some people it just clicks and the shyness fades away. So if its right this will happen before you know it, happened with me and my boyfriend.<br>  I would say tell him when you feel its right, and if you get signals from him that he likes you too.<br>  If you just met him i'd wait a bit and get to know him more, then tell him yourself. Dont get someone else to tell him, if you tell him yourself he'll see you as confident and it will show that your coming out of your shell around him.
MWjNp6y3aa	What you think clubs are the only places to get dates? Go ahead and ask if she would like to go and do something sometime. If she says yea that would be cool then ask her for her number and you will call sometime. Then find something to do with her and call her up and ask if she wants to go.
MWjNp6y3aa	Find a new man please. Stop torturing yourself. A new man will help you get over these feelings. Wipe the slate clean and start with a new guy.

S0iqDSSPaa	I used to have a girlfriend that came once a week..lol..it was great. She lived 45 miles away but I grew up with her. She would come on the weekend to see her family then stop down for sex. Then she would go home and leave me alone accept for a few phone calls during the week. She quit coming when some one told her about this other woman that I was kind of hanging with. We like never agreed to be exclusive or anything so I didn't think that I was doing anything wrong. Any way it was great while it lasted. The perfect girlfriend. Screw my brains out one day a week and then go away and leave me alone.|`|pOTigVYPaa	Why play "hard to get" when you've made it obvious that you are so "easy to get"?

ZNzu6gClaa	Well, he definitely has feelings of some sort for you! Trouble is, it is quite difficult to determine whether he is trying to:<br>  a) tell you he is ready to take your relationship to the next level; or<br>  b) hint that he thinks of you as a friend, and a friend only.<br>  From what you told us, it is a bit hard to say which of the two it is. Do a little more investigating, and maybe you will find some more evidence!

c5uwmEDKaa	I don't really think she's cheating. I mean, it's perfecly natural for her brother to drop his underwear in her house. Happens to me all the time. And don't worry about the other guy's penis inside her, sometimes people are just clumsy and fall in awkard positions. My god if I was to tell you how many times that was happened to me we'd be here all day. But you should worry about the card playing: sounds to me that she has a serious addiction. If you really love her, hell her and take her to Gamblers anonnymous.

Younger men will prefer woman with silky soft skin, big racks, great legs, and long shiny hair. Men in their 30s, and up will pay a bit more attention to details. Looks will still account for the initial spark, but they are starting to find sensitivity, and personality in  a woman attractive. Experience teach them, that a pretty face, or big boobs isn't everything. Big racks just makes a woman more sexually attractive, but has nothing to do with inner beauty. Men in their 40s prefer women that are compatible -- has chemistry with them. They prefer women that they can connect in a deeper level, even though looks will still play a part in the courtship stages. After all, we're visual hunters. Personally, I would of preferred a woman that's sexually attractive with a good personality. So, I would of taken the average looking woman with the big boobs. The pretty face one with the flat chest will physically attract me, but there will be no sexual attraction. Why you think a lot of men with flat chested woman are persuading them to get breast implants? Because, of the lack of sexual attraction.|`|qAcrK4KTaa	Alright Capri gave the best answer yet (Big Boobs Forever!) but hell since I'm here I might as well throw something in. True a "pretty face" is harder to alter than your breasts unless you are over weight and you have very saggy boobs then you are looking at some very unsavory options. But a good rack on a fit girl is even more rare than a "pretty face". So if there's a "skinny" or "fit girl" with Big Boobs (Enhanced or Not) Then she has a few-up on a girl that has a pretty face but her body looks like she got her genes from her kid bro. If someone wanted a girl that looked like a boy... its much wiser to just get a boy to begin with. But all you girls out there listen and listen closely... If your face is at all "normal" looking at least then focus on your Boobs and Bod. If you should always consider Enhancement there's many advantages. And you should always consider some excercise... as there are many advantages as well. So if you have the Fit bod and Big Boobs go ahead and bring it over to my place.|`|EUVr6uNVaa	Honestly?

NvgowkZzaa	Yeah, flirt with him. Laugh at his jokes, and smile at him a lot. Try to get a group of friends to do something and make sure his group of friends come along. Talk with him more and show interest in him and ask him questions about himself. Try to get a friend who knows that you like him go up and talk to him so it feels easier.
Me3Tsul0aa	It is common for this to happen in the beginning of relationships. The guy does like you but he doesnt quite know how to handle the situation around other people. <br>  So, if you two are still together, then the next time ur around people, try this.Its just a way of figuring out things. Interlock arms with him... like so, ur arm is passing thru his if u know what i mean. If he doesnt mind u doing that.then great =] if he feels uncomfortable then talk to him about it. Ask him if its people and why he's uncomfortable. He should understand how you feel just like he said.<br>  <br>  If you two are now friends, give things a break. Let him figure this out and during the time he is, you figure out yours too and if you think you are, ask him if he wants to or would like to get back or if he needs more time.<br>  <br>  Takecare and All the Best<br>  <br>  XOXO

i4bjQbPcaa	This wasnt your fault.  The first time you said no he should have stopped.

AA10086844	I think that would be a great idea.  Unfortunately we can't really control all the aspects of our weddings (for example, people will have to drive past an old school yard with barbed wire fencing around it (it looks like a prison!) to get to my reception!) but you can try to cover them up!  And I think that lattis is a great idea!  People will understand that you can't help where the dumpster is!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!!|`|c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	I think that is a great idea! I also think that you should hang a sign on it with the name of the bride and the groom and an arrow pointing to the beach, or a really sweet love quote. <br>  <br>  If there is just a covering for the dumpster it still looks a little random and out of place, but if you give it a purpose besides just covering the dumpster it ends up being something that is sweet and romantic and most people will not even notice that there is a giant green dumpster behind it.|`|qfUjyUDTaa	Have you tried calling your local council to see if they can re-locate it for the day? Its worth trying.<br>  <br>  If they wont allow the big to be removed/re-locate it, I dont think there's anything wrong with trying to cover/hide it! You dont want that in the back ground of your wedding photos....<br>  <br>  Given that it probably belongs to the local council...you'd better make sure you leave the bin the way you found it after the wedding. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|BgbWRvJXaa	you should ask to get something blocking that because you might be able to smell it!|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Not at all. No one wants a giant trash can at their wedding. See that someone disguises it or blocks it from view so everyone can enjoy your beautiful beach wedding and not see or smell the ugly trash! Best wishes on your wedding!|`|DFAS6jRRaa	I think thats a really good idea. I dont think its tacky, in bad taste or anything. A really brilliant idea.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Sounds fine to me, but are you legally allowed to do it? Is it a public beach? If so check with the council, sometimes they don't like people messing with things. If it is a private beach and you are marrying on someones property perhaps you could ask them to move it.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	It depends on few things; are you able to move the wedding down the boardwalk a bit to avoid the dumpster? Is someone going to be able to build something that doesn't draw more attention to the area? I think it's a great idea if something can be built can won't make people look at it. I understand your frustration, the location I got married had tractor equipment and broken down vehicles that they refused to move right on the lawn where we had the ceremony.

The boy I am currently infatuated with writes his own beautiful songs and plays in a style similar to Jason Mraz (it can be quite urban or sensitive). I believe everyone likes some type of movie or music; humorous movies and subtle songs are usually the most favored.

Ask him about it. If he gets defensive, than you no hes not right for you.... or if you dont have a problem with him drinking. Its your choice.|`|55kDtT7Taa	hes a teenager, and its not like you can control what he does=/|`|3rv5mjfeaa	yeah that's not really a big deal.|`|kccKDoooaa	what are u 5?<br>  everyone drinks!|`|bzgMI636aa	Boys drink to try and act "cool" or to try and stand out. Or he just likes the feeling it gives him.<br>  <br>  I take it you don't like that he drinks.<br>  <br>  Don't do ANYTHING about this yet unless you're sure with your own eyes that he drinks. Don't take others' gossip, because people do lie. Even if they're really close to you.<br>  <br>  I really don't like it when people so young drink, so call me a rat...But you could tell the school and ask them not to rat you out. Trust me, you'd be doing the right thing. I've had to do it and my friends never suspected me.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're still willing to date him even though he does drink, go for it. Be sure not to give in to any peer pressure. If he asks you to drink with him, tell him how you feel about his drinking. Or if you've been dating him a long time, you can bring it up one day. And be sure not to tell him off about it while he's drinking or you could get seriously hurt. Tell him the next day. If he really likes you and is really worth your time, he will listen.<br>  <br>  <br>  That was really long and probably didn't answer it very well or make a whole lot of sense, but that is what I would do. Hope it helps ;)|`|mZD2m4yyaa	It is normal for many to drink in high school ; but keep in mind MANY do not as well! It sounds like he brought it up to you to seem "cool". Don't be worried about problems until you consistently see drinking taking over parts of his life or he seems depressed.<br>  <br>  I would get to know him better before you judge...who knows, maybe you'll really end up liking him. If you do get to know him better and find he parties too much for you, then he might not be for you.|`|QdYNiBd8aa	Everyone drinks.|`|0cmfQqMEaa	omg everyone drinks at parties its normal!!! i go to a party every weekend and get really drunk its fun|`|FxpE8ivMaa	NOT a big deal, at all. Every high schooler drinks, some more than others, & probably everyone will smoke pot  (atleast most guys)  atleast once. so it's not a big deal, high school is all about having fun, as long as you aren't partying every day. give him a break, who cares.

ZNzu6gClaa	He probably just didn't want you to see him with another girl, because he wants to be with you and is afraid that you might think he is interested in someone else.

F08qx2hgaa	There's a videogame club at some schools- tell him to check it out, and see if any gaming girls are there.<br>  <br>  A variety of clubs at school can focus on academics. He just has to check them out and see if he likes them, and if they happen to have a pretty girl in them, great :).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, tell him to try mentioning videogames to any of his girl friends or acquaintances and see how they react. It's hard to fit all of those standards... he may be asking for too much.<br>  <br>  Clubs are a great way to meet new people.

This can go wrong in so many ways!<br>  <br>  First off, I completely agree with " =D "! Yet, I advise that you 3 go beyond that. Put a lock on your sisters bedroom door, the kind that only locks from the inside w/o a key, and instruct them to lock it only when they go to sleep.  This way, when dad tries to enter their room while they're asleep, he won't be able to.<br>   Sure, he'll get pissed off, because they are setting a physical boundary. No matter how or what he says, keep that lock on the door. He'll ask "why?"...the answer? "Because we feel safe." That answer alone will tell him they know what's going on and it's WRONG.<br>  <br>  I have heard & known too many women whose entire life was terribly messed-up because of sexual molestation & incest by an adult male family member during their childhood and teen years.<br>  Add to that the deep-set wounds by a mother in denial of her husbands/brothers/relatives illicit actions upon her daughters. I kid you not! Far too many times the mother would actually defend her hubby by accusing the daughter(s) of inviting his physical attention!<br>  <br>  Keep us updated, o.k.?

Step back from things for a bit. While the relationship may seem like a patient on the operation table and you are the doctor.....sometimes a "do not resuscitate" order is needed and let it live or die on it's own merits.

zzaScg0haa	Wow, you are definitely playing childish games with these girls
CBa9G4j4aa	It sounds like it if he does it back. If he thought it was annoying or something he wouldn't do it back to you. He's being playful by doing it back!|`|f8xmQjdkaa	I think I would like it....*cough*  oh, right...ahhh...<br>  <br>  I don't think so...if he liked it then he'd continue to do it, but he may enjoy doing it to you as well, thinking you like it more than he does.  <br>  <br>  If he liked it, then he'd let you do it.

However if I was not married I would tell him no, but he can give me his number and MAYBE I will give him a call if I want to get to know him.  Not for certain if I would really call, but hey I was nice.  But honestly he has to be more than good looking and the car can good or bad who knows.  He definitely would not get anything from me based on his looks and what he's driving.  He can't even get a kiss less known anything else.  Come on girls, that's too loose.  Shame on him if he thinks otherwise.  But as I said before I was nice, I let him give me his number considering he was cute enough to go that far. lol.  I guess that's why I'm married.  My husband approached me like a man should approach a lady.  I don't even think he asked for my number the first time we met. but hey everybody's different right.|`|re1ufu46aa	Probably laugh and run away! :)<br>  I don't really like cars and I think a girl that would give any personal information to a guy, just because he had a nice car, would be shallow.

When I was young and dumb I would have said there is no such thing as too much sex.|`|NtCya5NYaa	i think that too much sex is when you start to get sore and your whole body hurts and your just completly exhausted.

I just smile and say thank you for the compliment. However I don't have an arrogance about myself because I think arrogance in a woman or man is totally unappealing.|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	I know I AM|`|aO0JSbHTaa	YES I  AM DEF GOOD LOOKING|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I don't think so myself.|`|wggQRDb2aa	i don't know if I am or not but plenty of beautiful women have thought i was good looking and that's good enough for me|`|f8xmQjdkaa	I believe that i am good looking regardless of what others say.

yARKV3PXaa	When I got to my girlfriends house she doesn't really dress up. She wears makeup but other then that she has her hair up, sweater or a guy shirt on, and sweat pants. She still looks cute because shes just naturally beautiful and sexy. I'm at her house to cuddle and watch movies so she just needs to be comfortable.<br>  <br>  However every time she comes to my house she dresses up, she will always be wearing sexy lingerie and ready to go. If your naturally sexy your boyfriends not going to care.|`|N2BAdOXEaa	Yes, most of us like for you to pull out all the stops and show us your club look once in a while. But most I guess like the undressing part the best. And of course jeans can be sexy! Good luck with your choices.|`|lE9iAueBaa	it would depend on what the jeans looked like... I prefer a girl who dresses up more than a sweat shirt|`|mefxIQP9aa	Well, you could ask him but if he's not complaining about you know then he's probably already happy with you.<br>  <br>  It's up to you if you want to dress up for him. He's still with you so he doesn't seem to mind.|`|f8xmQjdkaa	Ask him, hon.  If you want to dress up for him sometime, then go right ahead.  If you think he's happy to see you in those jeans, then stick with that.  I think though, that dressing up nicely for him every once in a while would be good though, just enough to keep a certain image in his mind, but not so often that he gets used to it, you know?
jlEyE088aa	talk to him and discuss it out.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	talk to him and help him be more likable.

AKl0n2Liaa	My ex boyfriend (we're planning to get back together when he gets back) is a Marine in Iraq right now,  his deployment is 7mos and he comes back in April. The best thing I could tell u to do is write letters to him, as many as you can. Even if you don't get the chance to send them all before he gets back, it'll keep you busy. Try talking to him on myspace or facebook if he has it there. This could take the place of letters. I always feel like he's gonna be different when he comes back, but his assurance is what keeps me cool most of the time. I wish you alll the luck!!|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	he is over there keeping the peace here in the USA. Buy a vibrator and think of him, talk to him and use it when he is on the phone.

0FXVTZf7aa	Why don't you run the testimonies of real-life 40 year old virgins?  I know why, I used to go to conservative churches and met a few.  Their church leaders poke fun at them and they have a lot of weird problems.  The testimony of the people who ACTUALLY walk-the-walk does not sell the abstinence message, so I send people to the site below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible.  Contact the guy if you want, he'd probably debate you.
AA10065812	??  Sorry, this got a little long winded, but please read it all.<br>  Had you said any other state besides California and Arizona, than he has no access rights to the child, but California does have presumed rights for single fathers.  Now, I should tell you that the fault of him finding you, as well as partially for the law in California, is mine.  <br>  <br>  I've advised women for two decades, considering marriage to a childless man, to do a thorough background check to make sure he has no children, anywhere.  But, the reason for this is likely why he sought you out, but it also a possible way for you to deal it.  This this, let me relate to you a similar case, but first understand that under these circumstances, I advise the men not to attempt parental rights, provided the mother cooperates in another way.<br>  <br>  A woman had an affair with a young male during her marriage.  She also thought at the time that the child was her husband's, as she believed the young male to not be capable of impregnating a woman.  Fifteen years later, the marriage began breaking down, and her husband filed for custody.  Thinking that it may be possible he wasn't the father, she had a DNA test done, and it turned out to be true.  <br>  <br>  Now, though men are not allowed to do DNA tests to stop child support, women are allowed to use them to stop a him getting custody, but there's one drawback.  In doing so she loses any claim of child support.  As a result of this, she filed, and was awarded 15 years of retroactive child support against the bio-dad, which even cover all the years her husband supported the child.<br>  <br>  So, the bio-dad, now age 27, gets hit with $80,000 in retroactive child support, based fully on his current income, plus another four years, minimum, of additional child support.  He lost on appeal to the state supreme court.  But, he was denied visitation rights on the grounds that the knowledge of real father being 11 when her mother had sex with him would have a detrimental affect on her relationship with her mother.  No, the mother could not be charged as the statute of limitation had run out.<br>  <br>  Now, this is your option in this case.  If he wants access, than you can file for 11 years of retroactive child support.  Personally, I don't care for mothers doing this, but it is your option.  Now, if you don't get greedy, you can offer to drop the claim in exchange for him signing off any parental claim to the child.<br>  <br>  Finally, I need to warn you that even if he signs off on his rights, this may not fully solve your problems in the long run.<br>  <br>  Your son does not BEGIN developing the abilities for conceptual thought process for another year or so.  At this point, what he says he wants or believes is reflective of your wants and belief.  Whether he knows it or not, he does not want to disappoint you, or make you believe he loves you any less by expressing any other opinion. As he passes puberty, and especially into his teens, that may change.  Especially if he gets a little rebellious, as teens do.  You need to be prepared for this, because it will come back to bite you one day.<br>  <br>  Consider this your punishment for doing something you thought no one would ever learn about.  Perhaps this is a lesson to teach your children that when they are doing something they know is wrong, but believe no one will ever know about it, something, somewhere, sometime, will happen and everyone will know about it.|`|nCWjdyddaa	It depends. If he has a court order to that effect, then your son must see him. If not, it's at your discretion.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You need an attorney to help you through this one.  Your son is old enough to tell a judge how he feels.|`|buHzPMHZaa	His biological father has the right to petition to see his son.<br>  Your son only will ever have one 'real' dad, and that's not the issue. What is the issue is that a court can be involved, and although you're not in danger of losing custody of your son (based on what you're telling us), he may be able to secure visitation rights. <br>  <br>   Best to work things out amicably. You can do down to your local county courthouse and talk to someone in the family court. Mediation might be a nice way to settle this.|`|mcUSz16kaa	This is a very delicate subject. No, your son doesn't have to see him unless he really wants to, and is willing to do so on his own free will and without pressure.  It seems that the bio-father is deeply hurt and feels rejected by his own son. The bio-father, needs to come to an understanding that his son is looking at him like a complete stranger. The bio-father should also be respecting his son's feelings rather than trying to change his feelings for him. By having the bio-father try to put pressure on you by forcing your son into seeing him, he should realize that it will just make his matters worse with his son. Thus, it will put a defensive pyschological impact on your son's behavior for life, if it hasn't happened already. Your son is at a very vunerable age right now.<br>  <br>  Perhaps all 4 of you (you,your husband, your son and bio-father) should plan on getting  together so it won't be so uncomfortable for your son to see him. Do something fun that your son likes to do and have him invite a friend of his to come along.  Keep on having fun group sessions/activities  until your son is completely comfortable around his bio-father. Of course this will take time & patience for all of you, but it may be worth doing in the long run in order for your son to finally accept his other dad in his life.    <br>  <br>  I suggest seeking family counseling for ALL of you if everyone is willing. After all this is for your son's well being and developement for him grow into having a happy and healthy life, and for the rest of you as well. <br>  <br>  Anyway..FYI.. if it's allowed in the states and it goes this far:<br>  <br>  There are 4 types child custody :<br>  <br>  Joint legal custody (both parents have all rights & responsibilities)<br>  <br>  Sole legal custody (the most common when someone is in trouble)<br>  <br>  Sole physical custody (when 1 parent has the majority contact with the child- living with the parent - court granted visitation rights)<br>  <br>  Joint physical custody (when both parents have large amounts of physical contact with both parents -(living conditions with the child are shared throughout the year an rotated with the parents- child may have 2 homes in this case).|`|qBHjIrVHaa	Get legal advise, this is nothing to play around with here.  <br>  <br>  If he takes you to court, then he is risking having to pay you back child support for the last 11 years.   I don't think he has any grounds to take your child if you have a steady home.  Where has HE been for all these years anyway.  I have to wonder why you agreed to a DNA test after all this time also. He couldn't force you without a court order. <br>  <br>  A judge may grant him visitation, possible shared custody at most unless he can prove you unfit in some drastic way.  <br>  <br>  Best to beat him to the punch and get some real legal advise.  Stuff like this varies from state to state.   <br>  <br>  You should look into some family counseling.  This is a lot for an 11 year old to deal with.  The child is the most important one in this case, what is healthy for him!   A long lost Daddy making threats about taking from the only home he knows after already losing the man he thought was his father has to be confusing for him.|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Wow your sitation is tough I would definitely seek the advice of a good family attorney to find out.  Good luck.|`|c1paW0bAaa	Easy.  Let your son see him, the accuse him of molesting him.<br>  <br>  No more problem.|`|AA10465474	Your son's bio father has no claim on him and I'm assuming that he is not on the birth certificate. I don't know California's legal system but unless he is paying child support he really can't do anything. And I don't think the courts would press it. This is a lot like adoption, and I want to reiterate that I'm assuming he is not on the birth certificate. Some one cannot one day come out of the wood work and expect the courts to give him custody. Also remember that in most states the age of 13 is when the child can make the decision on who they want to live with.|`|Ncad6d57aa	Well, every state has diff. laws concerning this and I don't know california law but generally speaking, if he wants to take you to court, let him. You've taken care of the kid for 11 years and if you're not a crackhead or a skank they won't take him away from you now. They never like to change the situation unless something is harming the child. If he takes you to court he could be awarded visitation, but then he'll hve to pay you child support too, so tell him that!!! Also, in most states, they take into consideration the kids point of view and since your son is 11 they will ask him and if he says no they might not make him, but your son would probably hav to explain why. But make sure you tell the father about the child suppot, he'll probably back off lol|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	Yes, your son is a minor and therefor he can't refuse his Bio-dad visitation.  His bio-dad has ever right as you have and can take custody if he really wants to.  I know its hard for your son but you have to let his bio-dad see him or take him to court for full custody without visitation; but he might do the same back to you.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	NO!!! you have had your son for 11 years and his "bio" dad has only seen him a few times in that 11 years so he has no grounds to stand on 1st off. 2nd he would have to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that you are a bad mother and you can't provide for him or that his well being is compromised in any way. If your son does not want to see him then so be it, don't force him, hears another thing, this guy would have to petition the family courts for any rights to your son and then again he would have to prove his case to even be considered. Your son only sees your ex as his "real dad" because he is the only dad he has ever known so this guy you had the affair with has nothing and is just trying to scare you, don't let him do that to you. get a restraining order and order of protection to help keep him away from you and your son and help with the harassing phone calls if they start, then if he would try to take you to court you get a legal aid attorney {free attorney for low income families} and smear the court room floors with he face because your case is a hell of allot stronger then what he must think and by the time your done with him he will feel lower then a snails belly.

T5o0I4bOaa	Honestly, I don't think going to Prom alone is that big of a deal... But if you really feel that you need a date then ask a friend, either someone who goes to your school or that doesn't (sometimes its better if they don't go to your school). You don't need to ask them in a big way, especially if you don't know if they'll say yes! You can just bring it up casually... like "Hey, have you thought about going to prom before? Really? Do you have anyone to go with yet?" If they say yes then just say you're still thinking about it. If they say no then just ask them. I know it seems like the worst thing in the world if they say no, but trust me, it's not the end of the world! For my senior prom, I didn't get the dress I wanted but still had a great time so don't worry about that lady! Prom is still months away so you have time, just take a breath and realize things will be okay. Also, just a little bit of info, I had more fun going to prom with my friends then I did going with a boyfriend... =]

d46f610a60316733e6c17cc867554da4aa	Sometimes a guy knows that a girl finds him attractive in some way - we're not entirely clueless - and he will encourage it just because he likes the attention. Other times, it could be because he is kind of attracted to the girl. There is really know way to know unless you talk to the person.
iizKx4Bvaa	I suppose it is no walk in the park. I do so believe in open communication. You will heal in time. Learn to accept that it was not your doing.|`|V7grzObHaa	i went through so many emotions:  anger, resentment, bitterness, grief, hatred, loneliness, despair, helplessness, low self esteem, inadequacy, suicidal feelings....then comes the eventual acceptance and healing.  yes, it will take time, depending on how long and how deep was the relationship, but if you continue to push forward, allow yourself to feel all of these emotions and say to yourself "No matter what I feel, I will be okay" then YOU will be okay, in fact, even better and stronger than you were before this ordeal.  the human psyche is amazing.  i went through my husband cheating on me and in time i healed, forgave him (not for him but for me) now i am on the way to a healthy and happy recovery, really appreciating life,........MY LIFE!|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	Thats exactly how it feels. I was cheated on after a 28 year marriage and I felt as though my life had ended. It hasn't, and now I am the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. Only time and friends are the only thing that will get you through this difficult time of your life. It will get better as time passes but I am here to tell you, it will take a long long time...Just try to be patient and one day someone will mention your X's name and it will just be a distant memory...It will feel as though you dreamed the entire thing.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	All of the above.  Additionally, the next 6 months you want to revenge on the other person and ruin him as well.  Depends on whether the cheating party is willing to own up to the problem or try to blame and counter-blame.<br>  <br>  Things don't really help even if you jump to intimacy as a way of forgive and forgive.  Not quite.|`|gYEjrtl3aa	I have been in depression since 1998 medications by the dozen haven't recovered since.<br>  I tried to recover,  it's just a long story once upon a time.  Dart day's are here, looking for the sun to shine and maybe a brief rain of enjoy to come my way.  But only in my dreams will that ever take place.  Piece is where the heart finds happiness but I believe it will only  be in my imagination.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Like you have been kicked in the guts.  And you heart ripped out.  And all your dreams for a future together with your partner are all hopeless and gone.<br>  <br>  And strange feeling like, whilst the rest of the world is going about its business all around you.. but strangely you feel like you are in a vacuum, silence and feeling all alone.  And thinking "why? why? why?".|`|nowngQiPaa	your world has collapsed on you.  your heart is being ripped out of your chest, you can't breathe, and you just want to lay down and die. but you cant. you have to get up, brush it off and move on.  it is so hard. my husband has had a girlfriend for at least a year, i just found out about it.  i am devastated.  i am in so much pain, i can't function. i have been married for 14 years and have 3 children with him.  i hurst so bad.  i just can't believe it.  we haven't had sex in 15 months, he just hasn't been interested, i have, and i didn't know why, now he says he can't be disloyal to her.  what about me,  i told him i wanted a divorce, he said he has no money no car and no job, he wasn't going to leave, he wasn't going to pay child support.  well tough shi*. i am saving money to get a divorce and i will as soon as i can get enough money together.  i wish you all the luck.  i am still hurt beyond belief, but anger has taken over the hurt.<br>  good luck to you|`|CQsD09D6aa	I felt incredibly hurt and confused. I lost my self esteem and felt that I just wasn't attractive enough; it was somehow my fault. Looking back I can't believe I was so silly to allow myself to be hurt over such a loser. I am glad to have him out of my life. By leaving me for another woman he did me a favor.|`|cFDw3DU0aa	It is the worst thing a person could go through i think! I wanted to die! I know i didn't do anything wrong but i blame myself...i go through all the what ifs..nothing works...depressed..i don't eat..stay sick half the time...and it doesn't help i have a very active imagination and im constantly thinking about it and picturing what happened...i also feel very angry...i am so ready 2 destroy her life...just like she did with mine...this girl was stupid though and sent my husband very revealing pics of herself...they are now on my phone...its taking all i have not to print them out and plaster them EVERYWHERE!!!|`|oqQdutsfaa	anger, hate, low self esteem, want to kill a h*e, want to make his life miserable, and inflict pain, cuts and bruises all over his body.

67a72436032daf47d4ad4cdfcfd95158aa	If he didn't answer the question about whether he was seeing someone else, I'd say he's seeing - or at least has his eye on - someone else. In that case it's not a problem of having moved too fast, it's a problem of him having some involvement with someone else. He might be in a long term relationship that he's not happy in, or in the process of breaking up with someone, or just started something with someone else, who knows? He's been on some dates with you and enjoyed them - if he's with someone else but dissatisfied you'll definitely be on his mind.<br>  <br>  It doesn't sound to me like you have many options here. You could call or text him and throw a hissy fit, or gently let him know that you'll leave him alone and he can contact you when he's ready, or say nothing at all and move on. Maybe you'll hear from him again, maybe you won't. I wouldn't recommend waiting for him.
QqXpkatHaa	Not too sure...but telling someone the truth would be amongst the worst - as 75% of us don't do it.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	hmm<br>  <br>  "if i could rearrange the alphabet i'd put U and I together"<br>  <br>  lol i heard that one of family guy.|`|EMYImof1aa	are you from Tennessee? cos you're the only 10 i see :D|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	i've been noticing you noticing me and i just wanted to give you the notice that i've noticed you to|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	"Is that a (whatever you're holding) in your hand or are you just pleased to see me?"|`|WhAKntgGaa	This face is leaving in ten minutes.

5TIIgqhhaa	yes it could be. guys say a lot of things just to make a girl happy or get wat they want. but it all depends. i think he actually meant it.|`|bQu4A2awaa	yeahh basically..<br>  dont try to find like a hidden meaning in that..<br>  he considers you his friend, and he can trust you<br>  and THAT'S IT.
nooi0ldjaa	that's a hard one, since a lot of people wait til their 20's or 30's to marry...but you also don't want to end up being like the kids in the UK, 15 and 13 and already had a baby.<br>  <br>  i think its more or less up to the female in the relationship.<br>  because of course 90% of guys would screw on every date XD<br>  <br>  i dunno, i guess if you and your partner (well, not you, but you know what i mean) feel like you have a good relationship going, and both willing...why not?<br>  <br>  edit, in short...its up to the girl.|`|irQMy4Ciaa	I do but I don't.<br>  I would never just go out there and have sex with every guy that I date. I would wait until I was certain that this is the guy who is right for me so probably no, I would not have sex before marriage unless I knew for certain the guy was going to stay truthful to me and not leave me for anyone else.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Sex is for people in a loving, committed relationship. That can happen before you get married. And, in fact, it's probably not a bad thing to establish a sexual chemistry before you decide on marriage.<br>  <br>  That being said, a lot of people are having sex to get their kicks. They justify it by relabeling lust as love and they don't even seem to realize the difference. I'm constantly miffed on how many people out there are depressed and unhappy and turn to alcohol and loveless sex for comfort. Is it really better to abuse sex or booze than it is to sniff crack or puff marijuana??<br>  <br>  Just don't have sex out of lust that you're tricking yourself into calling love. It'll make me sad.|`|NoLt3X5faa	no i don't because if you love someone and you feel that you will be together along time then that's definitely enough marriage is just a legal agreement my cousin has been with his girl since they were 17 and now there like 40 something still not married b/c spiritually and emotionally they feel that they are married the only reason to get married is if you don't trust them and you need a legal agreement<br>  <br>  ps: sorry its long but its just what i believe.|`|KmULmT7Baa	I think if both people are ready and use protection if they don't want to get pregnant it's fine|`|OodDwzYkaa	Im a mormon do the math|`|84c5a932ff70a051b8ec3676232914a5aa	Absolutely, by all means have sex before you are married...just make sure that it is someone that you love. Good lord if I had a dime for every married couple that has problems with their sex life simply because they waited for marriage to start sleeping together I would be a rich woman. Sorry, I would never marry a guy that I wasn't compatible with...and that goes with sex too.|`|RimIRKEraa	sex is marriage.<br>  <br>  you pretty much never forget your first sex.<br>  <br>  your married to that experience for the rest of your life, and every other encounter you have is measured up against it?<br>  <br>  so yeah... if your first experience was a miserable premarriage drunken half date rape... well that is gonna take a lot of true love and healing to be free from that trauma.<br>  but some people get married in terrible ways to, like that 8 year old girl kid to some 40 year old man in saudia arabia... thats a rooted up way to go about it. im lost about this whole deal...<br>  <br>  in love?<br>  how do you differenciate between love and lust?<br>  if love is selfless and lust is self centred...<br>  how can you be in love with somebody? coz by being in love you know you are in love, hence it is a self centred experience. coz they make you feel in love about it.<br>  <br>  sorry im just a confused lost kid|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Sexual compatibility is an important factor in marriage so it is a good thing to figure out before you tie the knot.  I agree you should wait until you are in love with the person and are completely comfortable|`|Jgy7nqPdaa	I think you should have sex when your in love. I wouldn't wait till marriage cos its not like getting married says i love them even more than i do now so what should i wait.|`|n8fn4gG9aa	Depends.<br>  It's very complicated.<br>  I want to wait, but I highly doubt it.|`|9IyIO0Qkaa	i think that its ok to do it before but you should do it with someone you realy care about its not good to have random hook ups
BruAqXjDaa	talk to him and if you have a good conversation just go.<br>  "by the way, i kindof like you"|`|PJZRGsc3aa	say it straight up<br>  personally i think any other way gets a tad bit stupid|`|WoAAdxHEaa	play the guessing game. give him hints and make him guess that you like him :)|`|v4vP7vkWaa	That would be the most amazing thing ever if you told a guy you liked him. I mean, he prolly likes you too, so it's just taking stress of his watch.<br>  <br>  Just do it however you want, he won't care!|`|NS57cIo1aa	just show him... if yr watchin a movie... get closer to him... when ever your together... and leaving.. give him a hug... if you already do that hug him more intimatly and closer... just those little hints lets us guys know yr interested|`|GpitqYxcaa	You should straight out tell him. It's the best way and it's easier on the guy lol.|`|GE0Qb3iwaa	say it straight up<br>  anyother way could just confuse him|`|VgiUGqxtaa	I personally believe that if a girl likes me, she should just take me to a corner & straight up tell me..<br>  <br>  Ex: "Look _______, i have no other way of saying this, so i'll just come out and say it, i like you, etc.<br>  <br>  If a girl did that, even if i didnt like her @ first, i'll suddenly start seeing her in a new light, especially if she's a shy 1.<br>  <br>  <br>  But then aain, that's me.|`|hTre6eYNaa	Ask if you guys can go for a walk or just talk for a minuet and tell him how you feel about everything when your alone, don't hold back. Maybe plan a movie date or sumthing for the weekend cause it makes it more official when you actually do sumthing together then just saying you will in the future. If he doesn't like you there are more guys out there you learn through experience.|`|ObicYeTdaa	there's nothing than saying it straight up.<br>  <br>  if you want, tell his best friend and tell<br>  him "don't tell him please!"<br>  <br>  of course the friend will tell him. lol<br>  <br>  act "mad" when he tels you his friend told him.|`|zuaaMg4saa	Most girls usually tell there girlfriends<br>  to walk up to the guy and tell them that "oh my friend Jenny Likes you"<br>  and it would get akward tid bit but if he has the same effection he will come 2 you after he knows|`|EXM1nHNFaa	well since you clearly wrote "I don wanna say it straight up" I guess no one should put that.<br>  <br>  imo.. love letters are the greatest thing... you can put all your feelings into it without holding back.|`|MPfj42xDaa	Just talk to him. I hate it when women play with emotions.|`|vrfKf5o2aa	an email tbh. least if i dont feel the same way its less hard on both of us.|`|5SGDvWfJaa	1:find out if he would like you<br>  <br>  2:start conversation wit him<br>  <br>  3:work your way over to who he likes, what he likes, ect.<br>  <br>  4:tell him you think hes cute or something like that<br>  <br>  5: tell him you like him?<br>  <br>  easy as that?|`|hMrCaYQmaa	I'd just tell him, if that doesnt work out have a freind tell him. Thats how i found out about my gf liking me.
72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	yes! finally someone understands! playing hard to get is an immature game! lol<br>  <br>  If I like someone, I wouldn't play hard to get, but it wouldn't delve into things either. I want to be able to respect myself and not over commit (who would?).<br>  <br>  It's advisable not to be too forward in case you act too clingy or shows you are too immature to be in an adult relationship. At the same time, I wouldn't back off comepletely so it looks like outright rejection.<br>  <br>  I would keep things socialable and give some signal and not move on further until SHE shows some obvious signal that she likes me <br>  <br>  So many idiots out there think playing hard to get is courting or make them seem more valuable - what planet are they from? It's like there's no adults out there to date anymore lol.<br>  <br>  Playing hard to get isn't something present in any aboriginal or native tribes (these people support their traditions for thousands of years and they conform to the more natural ways of human courting); it's isn't something that's present in any part of animal kingdom either - just some weird stupid game some girl made up in the last 100 years.<br>  <br>  If they do insist on playing games, they could at least try something more sophisticated. It's starting to insult people's intelligence and maturity.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|2423ab71f29eb2c67bb1532f87145e64aa	some times|`|piHVQmXdaa	Of course that's a silly game, which is why I don't do it. Some people think it will get them more attention, I think that it's pointless. I hate it when people play games with me, so I don't play games with them either. I like it when people are up front with these things.|`|RI1brp91aa	Haha, at first I play a little hard to get to see if they are actually into me, then i give them big green lights (a go-ahead) and usually they return the gesture.|`|n8fn4gG9aa	do you play hard to get?? of course <br>  Isn't that just a silly little game?? never|`|VkVyuq5baa	I don't. No way, far too risky.<br>  <br>  And if girls do it, it's just plain annoying and doesn't add to her appeal at all|`|ppTbSXxOaa	I do think it is a silly game, and no I don't play hard to get.<br>  However, some people do this because they are afraid of commitment.|`|h6PwIBVMaa	I might depending on who the guy is but if i know the guy likes it straightforward thats what ill do<br>  <br>  depends|`|CBPyxlx9aa	Depends on how much fear you have|`|mJo35PwXaa	i think its a stupid game but ppl always seem 2 do it :(|`|qgr0sT8naa	yeah, but i make it obvious that that's what i'm doing if he likes me back
GomZ9oYHaa	Well if i had a brother half as good lookin as me i might of tried to date. But alas i dont have a brother..or a sister. As we say down south it aint exactly right to do your own kin folk.

It is illegal everywhere in the US and Canada to marry your sister or brother or father or mother or grandmother or grandfather though you can marry your first cousin.<br>  <br>  but you can date whoever you want because there or no such things as dating laws.  and if everyone involved is a consenting adult you can have sex with whoever you want.<br>  <br>  but nice try at sounding like a hick.|`|44V96YOKaa	well there is this little thing called in- breeding. when people reproduce with their close relatives it causes all sorts of horrible birth defects. then that continues on through the family. babies die, are horribly brain damaged. deformed, etc. you really need to ask why would you want to date!? your sister. there is a big big world out there and plenty of girls beside your sister. it is not legal because it goes against the laws of nature!!!!|`|AA10347478	Because your genetics are to close to the same, you will have a deformed, retard baby... incest is against the law for a reason.|`|2474b0cded1ef524c6f008fb96f1a0e3aa	Its definately wrong.

JhvqUvlsaa	I would just go ahead and ask her and see what happens; your motives are pure so why not? If her BF has a problem with it he can talk to you about it and the two of you can chat. Assure him that you just like her as a friend and you miss hanging out with her. Then offer to hang out later like next week the 3 of you; see if that puts him to rest. But I don't think you and her outta hang out behind his back; too risky. =)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|IFHzCyOkaa	umm hello of course it would be ok you can do whatever the ffuuck you want you dont need the bf's input|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Sure! It should be fine, as long as you aren't just wanting to hook up with her. And as long as she isn't going to do something like that because that would cause drama between all 3 of you.<br>  But yeah, that sounds fine!!<br>  <br>  :]
iizKx4Bvaa	doing well for yourself in school. Education is a tool to be used to gain ones freedom. Once you are of age or you think things are going to happen that you are not in agreeance with thn you go to the proper authorities and say I do not want to marry.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Finish school and go to college. Get a job and find a man you love and want to married to. Simple. <br>  When your parents say "marry this guy we found for you" say no. They are not going to physically force you.
R1NSqNi3aa	Maybe if you give her something personal such as make a photo album with photos of you both doing things together with different comments and stuff in it. You could make it really creative and lovely. I think it would mean a lot more to her if you give her something that you have really thought about and tried to make special (whatever it is) :)|`|HJrTuihcaa	well you could get like a cute photo album and put pictures from when your little to now. and you can decorate it and everything. my friend did this for me and it's sooo cute !

ZU5y3OVVaa	You need to understand tat your needs are just as important as theirs. Don't row or shout but tell him you need to talk and that he must start to address some of your needs. <br>  <br>  Any one sided relationship is doomed. If you are feeling confused and stressed then don't try to just discuss your issues. Sit yourself down in a quiet place with a cup of tea and write down what you feel. Sort your feelings out and list what your IMPORTANT needs are. Don't try to resolve all your issues at once. It cannot be done.<br>  <br>  When you are sure of what you want to discuss, tell him you need to talk and deal with the important issues. The minor ones can be sorted over time. You should never think you need to improve because your needs are not met. The problems in any relationship belong to both people and you have to be comfortable with each other or that love can quickly turn to hate.|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	You're very young to be taking on someone elses child, especially considering your relationship is still pretty new.

Someone who would lie to me, betray me, cheat on me, harm me or my loved ones, steal from me, etc doesn't deserve my love and either won't get it, or will lose it if they ever had it.<br>  <br>  No, it's not right for others to dictate who you should and should not love. That's for you to choose...even if the choice isn't wise. However, those that love you may try to influence you because they care, so take it in the spirit it is meant.
e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	He needs to be in a program to help him deal with is drug problems and help him get clean and train for some kind of job....living free at your house is not going to do that.You and your husband need to talk to your minster or doctor about looking into getting your step son in to a program that can get him off drugs and healthy once more,plus help him find a way to support himself.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	The worst thing you can do for an addict is to enable them... You cannot convience anyone of anything. You can move on with your life when someone steps on you, disrespects you, & does not honor you with a discussion of what's going on in your home. What's wrong with you stating that you are moving out?  Say to your husband, I won't be treated this way. Spend the money to put your son in rehab, that I will support. However, You both abusing our home is not tolerated. PERIOD!|`|iOqmoIrcaa	You and your husband need to schedule an appointment with a counselor at a rehab facility and get them to help you to set some rules.  This way, it isn't coming from you, it's coming from a professional.  Then you follow the rules.  It's hard, but understand that this man is an addict.  He is eating because his body is literally starving.  It is necessary that you feed him enough for 10 people.  The sleeping is a result of the withdrawal, perhaps.  He really should be in rehab.  Encourage it, but don't demand it.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	He will get tired of his crap.  The son will not change and dad will see it.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You are a heartless person........and if a parent wants to help their child out that is their business.  You may be the new wife.. and this all may bug you, but his son is an addict.  Why don't you try being positive and help him out.  It's a disease......be glad he's eating food, because a meth head doesn't eat, be glad he's sleeping because a meth head doesn't sleep.  he needs all the help he can get or he will die.  Be a good wife and support your husbands decision.  If you don't like it, then you might want to leave.|`|e1oky4jSaa	Wow that is really sad. Hopefully that guy gets help, some parents will enable that behavior though for years. Sorry you ended up in that situation; This is why blended families can be rough, even if they are not "kids" that you are stepparents to. Give it some time, insist that the man follow the rules, and if he isn't trying to get clean then I would insist he find some place else. Usually druggies will want to live with their friends anyhow and not in a "clean" house. They will want to use. I say that if he is caught using in your home you call the police. Be firm on that that you do not want drugs in your home. Meth is very dangerous, causes people to do scary things. You have to protect yourself.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	You are right to fear for the marriage, and you need to let your husband know that he is the cause of it -- time and again, it has been shown that it is the "feeling sorry" enablers that perpetuate these situations, and the problem person is going to drag EVERYONE down as they sink into the sorry hell-hole that they've are digging for themselves.  If hubby wants to do anything, it should be to pay for rehabilitation... even though the recidivism rate is very discouraging, it's really the only realistic option.  Good luck.|`|c1paW0bAaa	Cut off all sex until he agrees.<br>  <br>  A person like the son will never change until he wants to get off the drugs.  The husband is just feeding the addiction.|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	Move out and hope that he comes with you.|`|jMLa696Taa	can you go away?|`|Ncad6d57aa	First off, your husband should have discussed this with you PRIOR to moving his son back in, regardless whether it's your child or not. But seriously, sit your husband down and you guys need to come up with a time from to get the boy sober, give him time to get a job to save up money and get his own place. He doesn't need to live there with you guys he's a grown "man." Come up with a time frame and tell the boy to hit the road. If you and your husband aren't in agreement, get a nuetral third party like a counselor to sit down with the two of you and figure something out because pretty soon it's going to start eating away at your marriage.|`|oGoWz511aa	Leave your husband's wallet on the kitchen table at night.  <br>  <br>  I have friends who took in their 38 year old, heroine addicted son.  He's stolen checks, money, and family goods like silverware and antiques.  He eats but never cleans up, doesn't do his own laundry, and can't so much as figure out which is the working end of a hammer.  8 years later, he still lives with them.  He did manage to finally get himself a part time job, but they're still responsible for most of his finances.  <br>  <br>  EVERYONE tried talking them out of it, but they usually got angry and felt other people needed to mind their own business.  <br>  <br>  I wish I had better news for you, but if my example is any clue, I suggest you give your husband an ultimatum.  Then, be prepared to be the one who ends up moving out.
qfTgWDj2aa	Most of the guys I know prefer it when a girl doesnt give it up all the time. They like it when she does really spontaneous things like sex in the backseat of some public parking lot or things like that. A woman thats not afraid to express her sexuality and try new things is always better than one who simply has sex anytime he wants.|`|YSAfYkPwaa	Depends on the guy.  Hard to answer this question.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would want to do different things, not the same routine over and over.  Sometimes the routine is fun, but other times, I would want a different "way" to match my and my girlfriend's desires.|`|KXyyGvwKaa	Remember if your giving he will come. The real question is will he stay if you say no. My advice is to take it slow if you plan on being with him a while. Remember girlfriend don't show him all your tricks just yet.|`|faeXRQmcaa	Difficult question! Either of the two options can work.|`|StHedcXtaa	that is a good question i would like to know that too
LRPZJD5laa	it kinda depends where you live and how guys are there. they just want to make sure nothing bad happens to you.|`|4rLdaCNHaa	They may be a little over protective, but what they are doing isn't about protecting you, it's about them being bullies.<br>    Sorry but true, protecting someone calls for watching out for them, trying to make sure their safe.<br>    It has nothing to do with pulling heavies, ganging up on ppl or scaring them, your brother and cousin are just plain bullies that bring out the worst in each other.<br>    And one day, some girls older and tougher brothers/cousins may trip out on them for the same excuse and call it "reason".|`|PV9YFZNmaa	most male relatives are like that, your the only girl right? they just want to see you hurt. so tell them to give you some space.
AA12352139	Based on the comments above, I think it is naive to think that arranged marriages are different from forced marriages. Most cultures that practice forced marriages claim what they are doing is practicing arranged marriage. <br>  <br>  Because they have 'agreed' does not mean that some form of force has not been used.<br>  <br>  I grew up in Africa and have close friends of Asian origin (these cultures practice arranged marriages) and know the pros and cons of 'arranged marriages' - it's forced upon the participants 98% of the time. <br>  <br>  Adults should be free to choose their partners in any culture.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	It is wrong in the eyes of western countries but there are two sides to consider.  Too many western marriages are really based on lust, thought to be love for a few years. Around 50% of our marriages now fail within 10 years.<br>  <br>  In theory in cultures where arranged marriages are the norm the parents would make every attempt to find a good match for their daughter. It always amazes me just how many young girls you see aged around 20 who have 3 or 4 engagements rings adorning their right hand - it seems personal choice and 'love' is pretty fickle!  Maybe arranged marriages are not quite so wrong as we think.|`|cLDbxtARaa	family customs and adults have the right to say no|`|ScHW4842aa	Most couples who enter into an arranged marriage are willing and they trust their parents decisions when it comes to their spouse. I should know - my husband comes from a culture where they are common. <br>  <br>  From what ive seen of them - they arent bad. <br>  <br>  And a lot of them do work out. <br>  <br>  I think you should stop watching movies that are so steriotypical.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	arranged marriages aren't illegal <br>  as they are marriages with two consenting adults<br>  <br>  however, forced marriage is illegal where both parties have not consented to the marriage|`|Ka6PjecVaa	Fake marriage is absolutely illegal cz it's not existing according to law.|`|NI0cNU22aa	How is your parents choosing who they think you should marry any different from all the times your friends set you up on a date, or gave their opinion on the person you were going out with?|`|CQsD09D6aa	I do not think that it is wrong. The parents are supposed to act in the best interests of their children and often make a wiser choice than their offspring would make on their own.  The families are often involved and dedicated to the success of the marriage. Arranged marriage is not for everyone but it has its benefits.|`|AA11181695	I have many Indian and Pakistani friends who are like me middle aged and their marriages seem to be going great and filled with love.  They all had arranged marriages!  It is really not that weird to think that parents arrange a mate similar in temperament and personality to their child who they know so well.  Is it really better in the West where based on emotion, passion  and hormones two 18 year olds make a commitment for a life time?|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Two consenting adults is usually why it is not illegal. If they are minors then the parents have signed for them to marry, and the minors have not protested it to the courts.<br>  <br>  I think it is a bad idea too.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Wrong by what standard?  It still works in many cultures.  We have all the freedom in the world but over 50% divorce rate.<br>  <br>  The law can neither make it illegal nor interfere unless other laws are involved, eg, minors.|`|aYoscopKaa	Do you mean forced marriage? Forced marriage is illegal is most countries. Arranged isn't as the person is not forced to marry the person. If the parents help to find a fiancee for their child.. what's so wrong about that?|`|rftEZA50aa	there is nothing wrong or illegal in having an arranged marriage. This practise still exists among the aristocracy throughout Europe. FORCED marriages are totally different and should be fought against.|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	It is illegal in the UK for someone to force someone to marry.|`|D33VRTz8aa	Because in arrange marriage you have your say whether you want to marry the person or not. They can not force you to marry someone if you don't want to. Though they have the option to show you suitable match(according to them) for you. But the final say has to be yours if you don't like the person you say no. Therefore arrange marriage is not illegal.|`|WA8feS8taa	It's not illegal because you're not physically hurting anyone by setting up arranged marriages and it is still apart of certain cultures, plus you;re not forcing them to marry, the two consenting adults choose to say yes or no when they are at the altar. But I do agree with you, arranged marriages are a horrible idea.|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Arranged marriage is different from forced marriage. A true arranged marriage is not wrong - since either party can refuse. A forced marriage is a whole different kettle of fish - and is illegal in most countries.|`|g5I3tlQDaa	There is nothing wrong with arranged marriages as long as the participants are willing|`|omHCxaVJaa	its not legal here in the states, your free to marry whom you choose
k2ZRT4oPaa	Yes, it happens all the time.  Boys and men are often insecure and afraid of rejection.  It is a basic emotion that is often put in  proper perspective only after one has matured.  Girls and women often suffer from the same thing.<br>  <br>  What's the solution?  Recognize that you can't control their attitude or response, only yours.  What I write applies to women as well as men.  This isn't just a man thing ....  women have the problem also. You will find that your attitude or approach to relationships (meeting someone nice) will greatly affect the outcome.  Your attitude, your friendliness, your communication skills, your smiles, etc ...you can control and will greatly influence who you meet and the outcome.|`|c1paW0bAaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Simple to answer, difficult to change.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Yes.|`|bRAmXcowaa	constantly!!!! guys (the younger they are the worse it gets) do strange things to avoid displaying or announcing emotions. They often can come across as not liking a girl hat they are really interested in (particulary if their friends have giving them a hard time about it).<br>  <br>  but there is always the chance that he isnt interested in the girl as well. Best way to find out is to ask if there is anyone special in his life or just ask him out sometime|`|NI0cNU22aa	My wife has explained to me how girls come up with all sorts of reasons to explain why the boys that they like don't seem to like them back. The truth is, unless you're very young (which you might be) or the person you're thinking about is very shy, if he doesn't seem like he likes you, chances are, that's because he doesn't. Men are a lot less complicated than women as far as feelings and emotions go.
IAxQk3xEaa	cliques provide a sort of comfortable environment to people. if a cool popular kid were to talk to a nerdy kid about something a nerdy kid likes the popular kid would look stupid.. whatever you do don't change who you are.. yes if the guy  were to date an "outsider" his  friends would think differently of him, people always put their friends first its just how they work.sometimes ppl say they like someone so they can label themselves as a smooth talker, don't worry if he does it too much it will bite him in the butt and he will come crawling to u.. but if he does this keep your cool and make sure he knows it doesn't bother you. make him get you, don't try to get him.. if he sees that you are playing hard to get then he will try harder. sometimes ppl slip up when they do this so play really bad hard to get. if he tries then he likes you but if he don't then its a waste of time. the main thing is to always keep your composer.<br>  <br>      i wish  you the best of luck, and i hope it works out for you ;)<br>  take it easy,|`|E3Zqh0ZWaa	It is so stupid! im soooooooo completly happy that my school doesnt have that strict of cliques. most likely bcuz i live in a town of 3,000 ppl, and have been best friends with like everyone in my class. we do have cliques, but mostly bcuz there just different groups of friends. i talk to basically everyone. my group is neither popular, or losers. i like a guy, but it doesnt matter who he hangs out with. accually, his best friend's sister is my sister's best friend. <br>  <br>  join the same sport as the guy u like, it will bring u together, and it doesnt matter what click, cuz ull hav to hang anyway.|`|L2InbUACaa	People like to hang out and be with others like themselves.  They get along better with people like them.  some decide to label themselves under one homegenous category, some have others doing it for them.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Without cliques, the balance of nature would be damaged permanently.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Because the people that form and participate are idiotic, immature and need to grow up. Everyone has their own personalities and styles and such; they don't need to be put into groups with people who are 'similar'. Highschoolers need to learn to grow up and act their age, and actually distance themselves from their 4th-grade ways. Honestly, ANYONE who participates in cliques needs to grow up and get a life apart from associating with the people who supposedly "the same as they are".<br>  Get out there people!! Grow up!<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Mary (take action<3)|`|pOTigVYPaa	Cliques are formed for those who are insecure.  After high school, none of that matters anymore.  Just enjoy yourself while in high school, be the best person you can be, make friends with everyone and then when all the others "grow up" they'll find they have more in common with you than they thought.|`|fTpk7ospaa	i think it mostly because peopel want to fit in and people so are so different so they have the jocks and the cheerleaders and the nerds ect it is better to fit than to be an outcast.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Because everyone wants to fit in... cliques offer a place for you to fit in and no be different, in high school, different = bad.  Yes your right though, once your in the real world, being in a clique really does nothing for you.|`|ftvPJfEXaa	I'm under the preppy popular cheerleader.|`|x9FienLUaa	kids this age are looking for group of friends they can connect with they are so afraid of losing this group. that they will perform and act as the others in order to say in the "family".  Talk about a low self esteem issue- with these kids.  This is a tough age- no real sense of maturity yet and alot of pressure to be like everyone else.  ugh!|`|n8fn4gG9aa	Everyone sticks to their cliques because their afraid<br>  Afraid to be different.<br>  My sister says that it all changes in College.<br>  Remember this<br>  Everyday you go back to see those high school cliques,<br>  its one less day you have to go back.|`|1JvC68eSaa	Amen! I hate it and then when you try to talk to people, other people ask you "WTH WERE U IN MY HALL TODAY?" It's annoying. Middle School is so much more fun because you can be everyone's friend.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Finally someone that understands!<br>  <br>  They are stupid and those that take that too seriously will end up serving fries in mcdonalds|`|LuAa7Nypaa	Because highschool is fked up... No better answer then that.<br>  :)|`|lTFS226Laa	its how it works|`|nHC6hV7Haa	yes it wont matter but usually they give you a place to be in any way i agree they r stupid|`|F08qx2hgaa	They give people a sense of belonging and identity.<br>  <br>  Teenagers are all confused. They have to figure out who they want to be, where to go to college, and have many many choices to make that could change them for better or for worse.<br>  <br>  This makes them want something familiar, something sure. They want to know who they are. One way they learn that is through their friends and "cliques".<br>  <br>  To have something so familiar is comforting. <br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  HAHA, YES! You are a wise one. None of it will matter after high school, but do they know that? I don't think they want to. They ignore it, and when the timing is right... go away to their own lives, forgetting all of that social status and making something better of themselves.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Have you tried e-mailing him, maybe asking him out? You never know what will happen. If he likes you enough, he'll ignore his social status to be with you. If not, then he's not mature enough for you anyway, so it's his lose.<br>  <br>  Hey, don't fret. There are others like you, probably hiding throughout your school. And it sucks, to be in the middle of something so restricting that you never wanted in the first place, but just don't pay it any heed. Have fun in high school, keep ignoring those cliques, and be yourself!

If you need to know what to say to her, then these are weak foundations to build any friendship on.<br>  The fact that you ask for help up to three times in the same sentence reinforces my point.<br>  You sound a touch obsessed.<br>  Maybe you're just in awe of this girl's gymnastics level.<br>  Either way, I think she'd be very creeped out if she kept you awake at night.<br>  I think the whole Valentine's card shows that you are in over your head and the fact that you say "I really need it" is kind of scary.<br>  I think you should stay away from this girl, because this has a lot of potential to go very, very wrong and if you really care, you will back off and leave her alone.<br>  Please think about your own wellbeing, and maybe see a counsellor about this. They will give you honest, judgment-free advice on what you should do, and no doubt they will tell you to maybe go and find some other friends, on your own terms and maybe make a best friend with similar interests to yourself so you can discuss this, etc. instead of pining to be someone in particular's friend, because it will never work.<br>  Please, seek some kind of advice.

Eventually she will probably come round, and if not then it's unfortunate, but in the end a relationship takes two and if she ain't comfortable with it then it's never going to work.

TsoXZKSyaa	Be genuine and honest with eachother (maybe for the first time in a while depending on how your relationship was going).  Let him know the things you didn't like about the relationship (in the nicest way possible) and ask him if there's anything you need to work on too. Do it in a mature way and he will respect you.<br>  <br>  Even though you're taking a "break" from the relationship, you don't have to keep everything so strict, like if you want a hug or you feel he needs on just say "friend hug" and hug him :), that way it will be less hurtful being apart, and you can still work on things :).<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!! :)|`|lTFS226Laa	breakup|`|KXyyGvwKaa	the best thing to do is reflect on every aspect of your relationship and where it is you want it to go.

In the mean time reflect on the happy times of the relationship.|`|Zx5oMHPRaa	If you need a take time off you need to just break up.

You would talk things over and continue to love and support your significant other. Try talking to him or maybe couples therapy?|`|rWgt6EL9aa	If its meant to be, it will happen.  Everything happens for a reason...whether or not you see it now or not.  Just put him in the back of your mind and do things YOU want to do.|`|zrCTVaICaa	id go to cuples tharapey and mabey go out on a date of to and try to get him to open up a little|`|gRuTtwhoaa	In my experience this only pushes people farther apart. If your aim really is to get closer to him, this is probably not the way to do it. You being on a break will make him see you as less of a confidante. Maybe counseling or something is a better option? <br>  <br>  If you are still determined to be on a break... and actually come out of it again with your relationship intact, set rules now. Especially if you think it's not ok for you guys to see other people. What you do now can come back to haunt you if you do get back together. Think of Ross and Rachel from Friends and the whole "we were on a break" issue!

QGv8ngfeaa	I wonder why you ask this.<br>  <br>  I am inspired by Brent Spiner and his role as Data in Star Trek.<br>  <br>  When I started acting, I found it incredibly hard to stay present. The idea is that you create an original character who's skin you adopt is the written character by the playwright. You're supposed to LIVE the character, not act it.<br>  Growing up and watching Data on TV, I always adored him. He's endearing, innocent, naive yet intelligent, struggling for his humanity.<br>  <br>  The way Brent Spiner was able to capture his audience was endearing. His struggle for humanity is something every person on this earth can sympathise with. That's what makes him so special. The fact that Spiner is able to stay so present, bring out the sympathy for the character, reflects its internal struggle, and relate that major theme to the rest of the world... it's just pure raw genius to me.<br>  <br>  Spiner is a mentor for me as an actor, and his character as Data is one I greatly sympathise with. In both ways, I have been inspired by him.<br>  <br>  I have also been greatly dissapointed by him. When I got older and started to research Spiner, my impression was that he was a pretentious snob who, despite his genius and talent and empathy, seemed to lack humility. <br>  It really shattered my podium-view of him. I could not believe that the same man who emphasized with such an innocent and humble and human character (because part of Data's charm is how in his quest for humanity, that innocence and drive is extremely human), was also this egotistical and bluntly rude man I saw in the interviews.<br>  <br>  Hope this is an experience you were looking for.<br>  <br>  :)|`|ZCq2Y26waa	I would say Slash is my best inspiration for playing guitar because he is awesome at it, has an awesome band with it, a cool stage name, and to sum it up....

i6gTSnxLaa	u should let her no u found out, get an answer, and if she told u a lie maybe shes not the right friend, or there is also the possibility she is embarrassed about one of her friends and doesn't want you to see. and maybe she is being pressurized by her other friends to, but just go up and ask why, she may have a good reason.|`|Q5MZ36x8aa	I think that you find out she really did go to the movie with your other friends, and if she did its no big deal i don'tt think you should make a big deal about it. But if she is constantly telling you lies then i think that youshouldn'tt be friends with her.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You are rather simple minded.  A lot of things could have happened that changed from the time you spoke with her and when the affair took place.  Why are you looking so much for a lie and getting mad about it?  Insecure you to think that you have to know everything.  You had already declined, remember?  Maybe it was on the spur of the moment.  Maybe she tried and couldn't get you.  Or maybe, they just didn't care to have your company.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Hmmm.... sounds like you want it both ways.  Your friend didn't lie to you they just didn't invite you.<br>  <br>  You should be annoyed at the fact that you wanted to be somewhere else without them. Then when it didn't come off - you expected your friend to invite you to something that may have been a last minute thing.<br>  <br>  Hmm... I'd say your friend is giving you back some of your own medicine.<br>  <br>  Ask your friend about the plans and see what really happened, and why. Don't jump to conclusions.
JhvqUvlsaa	Well you have fault in this too cuz you pranked her. But yeah that's a bit harsh threatening you and stuff so tell your parents and/or the principal but be honest about the part you played in this; she's going to tell on you anyway. At the very least if they hear what you did from you then they will know the truth in the matter (in case she changes the story for her favor).|`|1JvC68eSaa	Tell your parents but DON'T SNITCH TO THE PRINCIPAL!

But i knew she wouldn't, and never did.<br>  But i would probably just tell a parent just incase.<br>  and forget about the stupid rumours, that's why their called rumours because just about all of them are fake. Its not like your gonna die if she starts talking about stupid crap. <br>  I think probably if you told the principle, it would cause more drama.<br>  And make sure you don't talk to her after this stuff is settled.because|`|92fNY4Fvaa	well, first of all, you shouldn't have prank called her, i have been in so many fights with so many people, and doing little things like that doesn't solve anything, it makes things worse.  but if she is making violent threats towards you, tell your parents, especially if one is a cop, and you should record the voice mails, and save the text messages. and tell your principal. because thats not good.|`|AA10936860	try to handle it yourself so u don't make it a bigger problem. Just tell some of your people that know her people that you're scared of her and if she's really ditzy she may get proud and just smile and get on with her stupid ways. If she really tries to fight, my moms a cop too Just protect yourself and make her feel embarrased for being so stupid. Don't   try to hurt her, try to control her but don't let her hurt you.

I don't know why little girls think that way but every guy she dates she is going to think that she could marry them. Five months doesn't mean  much in the grand scheme of things. Really though it doesn't sound like the kind of girl that you wanna date. Think about it, she puts up with her current boyfriend just because they have  been together for a little while and she thinks that if she stays with him long enough he will marry her and take care of her. Fine, but while she is with them she is going out with other guys and flirting and making out? Not cool. That pretty much means that she would most likely do the same with you. So yeah, I'm sure she would date you for as long as you would put up with her...but she will be seeing other guys on the side when she finds someone that she thinks is better than you.

Hj5sXNI7aa	Danielle,<br>  <br>  When you go out with a guy, you don't have to tell him right off the bat that you have an std. You won't have sex with every guy you date or meet. Only when you think you are getting serious, and I hope that will be quiet some time, that you need to offer this information. What you have can be controlled. I know couples that have this, they deal with it because they chose to be together. Wanting to be with someone because you enjoy their company, when you are starting to get thoughts of deeper feelings, then, allow them this private information. <br>  You are still the good, nice, caring person you have always been. This virus you have has not changed that! This is something you have to accept and it is hard to, but you will overcome this hurdle. Just remember, you are still a loving and caring person that still deserves the love of someone else in return. Don't ever forget that. <br>  <br>  boe|`|vTra7n5baa	It depends on how close you get with him spiritually.  If he's a great guy and really into you, then he'll accept your honesty.

dTcSBuYZaa	Well, let's start off with the first girlfriend thing... Maybe he is an experience listener to his best friend about girlfriends, and knows not to rush things.  Doing this could result in becoming easily bored, not differentiating between for real/fickle, etc.  Simply, as to how he can give the actions without the words.  If you can tell he has the actions then really the words would just be an extra...reinforcement, you might say.  When he wants to he will, but maybe it's just how he was brought up or his own judgmental values.|`|AA10048169	Didnt read it all, but guys dont say I love you.  we are all scared to.  that whens you become to attached and that hardly ever ends well.  99 percent of guys will wait as long as possible to say it even if we are feeling it.  dont force him to say it either.  i have had some strange moments when she says it to me, and i have to either say it back, or change the subject.|`|VUfT35UQaa	Wait for him to be sure of it. You don't want him to say it if he isn't sure.|`|nsZynBefaa	Maybe he's not ready to say those words? Perhaps he feels that they aren't words that are supposed to be tossed around carelessly? Not everyone loves right away, and honestly, he's smart for not just saying right away when you wanted to hear it. So give him time, and if you want to, tell him how you feel. He might understand.
VQs0adT8aa	Sounds like you love yourself more than his feelings.<br>  <br>  I agree with your man (or, boy, I assume) on this one.  "I love you" are loaded words.  <br>  <br>  It is clear by his actions that he DOES love you.  Why do you need to hear the words to know that he cares for you deeply?  It shows insecurity on your part that you need to hear them.  Whether it is the type of loving you are expecting to match the words "I love you" is a different question, but if he's showing you affection and devotion and consideration, why are you so conflicted?<br>  <br>  But these days, social conventions have put a lot of extra punch to those words.  Saying "I love you" means to speak of a particular kind of passion, commitment, devotion, present and future, etc.  He can love you without having come to a decision whether it's the kind of love that you would interpret if he said the words.<br>  <br>  I'm happily married and we rarely use the words "I love you."  They are sacred and special words.  Don't get me wrong-- we constantly tell each other we attracted to each other, like each other, respect each other, are happy with each other, etc.   Our verbal expressions of types of love are numerous and satisfying.  We can still share our affection verbally without going overkill on the most loaded phrase of all.  The idea is that even now, the words "I love you" are still special because we don't abuse them, misuse them, or allow them to lose their value by overuse.  When he specifically tells me he loves me, I know that he is thinking about our relationship past, present, and future, and all our experiences together and all our plans for the future.<br>  <br>  So don't push him.  He clearly wants those words to really mean something.  And when he decides that he feels what those words mean to him, it still may be difficult to say them to you, and you need to be understanding and welcoming to his struggles, not putting pressure on him.|`|e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	Some guys have a problem with saying those words. I would rather a guy not say them to me than to say them and not mean it. When he is ready to say those words to you he will.You say that he does everything for you ..well sometimes actions speak louder than words.Keep the faith when he is ready he will say them.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Look, he doesn't love you or he would have said it already. Someone who is kind and caring toward you doesn't always mean they're in love with you. You may love him and may be ready to hear that, but he's not going to say it until he feels it. Just relax, it will come|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Maybe he is not comfortable saying it yet.  Those three words aren't always easy for a guy to say.  Expression through words isn't one of our strong points.  As long as he is showing you through his actions that he cares for you, give him a chance to say it on his own terms.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	He is still questioning his feelings. Don't push, or he will push back. If it drags on for too long - he is not ready to have a relationship, that's all.|`|e1oky4jSaa	My husband didn't tell me he loved me until he really meant it, and that was about ten years after knowing me and a year of serious dating. Some people take love very seriously.|`|jMLa696Taa	he is not sure and he doesn't know really the world love. As what he knew, he likes you and has deeply affection to you that he loves being with you...well well well....actions speak louder than words.|`|WA8feS8taa	Well, I mean, he's not in love with you and I don't think you should force it. You've clearly brought it up to him and he's confessed to you that he can't tell you he loves you because he wouldn't mean it. At least he was honest with you which means he respects you. <br>  <br>  Here's what's going on with him: he's just not in love with you, give him time.<br>  <br>   And here's a tip for you: don't force him to be,  pushing him will make him feel even less for you which is something you don't want.|`|Ncad6d57aa	How old are you two? And usually guys take longer to say sentimental stuff like that to women. But it's really a bad idea to bring up that conversation it kind of makes you look desperate and needy (no offense just the truth). I really wouldn't bring it up anymore if I was you, and if he's not telling you what you want to hear sooner or later, then find someone else, maybe you guys want different things.|`|Dw4z2vyJaa	Because he don't love you duh...|`|94b8KImYaa	It is better that he means it when he says it. There are too many people out there which use those words too lightly. <br>  Besides, words are cheap - action counts.|`|cLDbxtARaa	he will when he is ready|`|0KLu4hRaaa	He has to come to that feeling for you on his own terms. Pushing him can make him feel even less for you. Let him say it when he is ready. If you can't wait then you need to move on.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Back off you are too pushy.....not trying to be mean.  Maybe he just doesn't know how to tell you.  After all you are his first.  Or maybe he doesn't feel that way about you yet.  Love comes slowly sometimes.|`|KJAKihaCaa	you should be able to say it all you want but don't force him|`|NI0cNU22aa	I don't understand the hang-up on words. I don't tell my wife I love her very often. I have no problem telling other people that I love her, but when I look at her, the mother of my children, and I think about the time we've been married (almost six years), the word "love" (or "k?rlighed," my wife is Danish) seems inappropriate, and small, and lowly. So I take care of her when she's sick, I make her breakfast, I plant her gardens so she can look out of our bedroom window and see something beautiful, and I make her favorite tea when she's tired. That's how I say "I love you." Actions, not words.<br>  <br>  If you need to hear the words, it shows a great insecurity on your part.
5YEKmHqyaa	He probably likes you a lot and is just not ready to say it.  You wouldn't want him to say something he doesn't feel yet.  I'm sure he'll get there but give him time.<br>  <br>  If you care about him just be patient.  You already know he cares a lot about you or he wouldn't even be with you, so just give him a chance and when he's ready, he will say it.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Guys feel like they love a female at a different rate than girls, so give him time.

F32uPjAraa	Mate in these days avoid all credit cards. Keep banking your money. Wait until you have enough cash to buy a car outright, but instead of paying cash, see your bank and take out a personal loan to pay for the car. Leave the total amount for the loan repayment in an account and pay the loan off over several months. This will begin your credit rating. If you can prove that you have regular employment, and have re-payed a previous loan, you should have no trouble getting a housing loan.|`|AA11148143	You don't have a lot of spare time ashore, so you should be able to stash cash in the bank.

Your sister is hurt that the limelight is not going to be on her, but you have to choose who is closest to you. Of course, she has every right not to allow her son to be your ring bearer. So you have a choice to make, family peace or pleasing your friend. If I were you, and this is only my opinion, because she is your sister, I would make her the maid of honor and have your best friend be the head bridesmaid. That way, there is family peace, your sister is at the wedding, and you get the ring bearer that you want. Just have a talk with your best friend and explain things to her. My brothers refused to come to my wedding and none of my husband's family came to it. That still hurts today.

In a way you guys wont get bored of each other, i mean i know that you guys aren't supposed to get tired of each other but it happens, not spending every waking minute with each other gives stuff to talk about and also perhaps it could strengthen your relationship even more since you guys wont be seeing each other so much, even though you said the trust level is really high, never hurts to surpass 'good' you know?

And not always having to sacrifice things for the other person. You can spend time with your friends. It's not always good to think of the other person all the time and spend too much time with them. I can't believe I'm actually saying this. haha. But it is true. I never thought of it as something fun when I was in high school/college (to be away from a guy I mean). But I'm on my own and out of school, so I kind of like things my way in my life and home. But both sides of it are nice. Being in a relationship, but still being independent. And when you miss him too much, write him a letter, or plan out some things or place you'd like to share with him when you are spending time together. Then you won't waste any precious time planning things while he's there and you'll have more time to enjoy being together. An hour isn't so bad. Heck, I always find guys that I like in other states. So be thankful that he isn't too far away from you. And look forward to the summer!!!!

JhvqUvlsaa	Well "hey what's up" is a good start. Just comment on their status. Don't force friendships; just let them happen. <br>  <br>  And when you write on their wall wait and see if they respond. They might start a wall-to-wall conversation or they might just respond by commenting on their own status. <br>  <br>  Just let the friendship be built on a mutual interest and a mutual trust; don't force it.|`|mR9ydwz5aa	its always awkward when you introduce yourself to someone, but you just have to get over it. facebook is a good way to make friends, or become better friends with someone. so yeah, thats a good idea. also, when you're introducing yourself, just say hi, im ___ whats your name? or maybe in the hallway just say hi and smile. if you're looking for conversation ask what class theyre going to next, or what their least favorite class/teacher is, or what school they used to go to. start with school conversation and then once you become better friends start asking about family or something like that. and for facebook, when you first get one, ask for help on how to edit your profile and stuff like that.|`|3Jqn7a3Vaa	Maybe stick with friends of friends... then you have something in common and it gives you a place to start.  <br>  <br>  As far as making new friends, maybe take a class or get involved with something that interests you (politics, or another non-profit cause possibly).

That may scare her away, and if you could go to jail for that (since she is a minor), and it is illegal for you to date family.<br>  <br>  Now, in genetics, I'll try to explain this simply. You have too much of the same Dioxyribo Nucleic Acid and Ribo Necleic Acid. (DNA, RNA). So, that would be like you're trying to have a child with yourself. Since in DNA, it is all the same. The double helix of your child will contain duplicates (three eyes, eight fingers...weird stuff).

Don't do it at the beginning of the week. That's not the best way to start someone's week off. Letting them know towards the end of the week will likely result in them finding something to do over the weekend amongst their friends to kill the pain. While it may seem like you're ruining someones weekend, its better for them being hurt and with friends rather than for them to be hurt and miserable while trying to focus on their job.<br>  Step2<br>  2) WHERE TO BREAK UP<br>  DO NOT BREAK UP VIA EMAIL, TEXT, PHONE (its considered cowardly)<br>  I read many articles advising people to do so at a bar, or a loud place. Seriously, how cruel can you be inviting someone to a restaurant or a bar only to break up with them? I would not advise it. "drinks on me", and it might literally be if you attempt it at such places. No matter how loud the place is, its nothing compared to how loud the dumpee can become. Save both of yourselves the embarrassment. My suggestion would be a more private area. A talk at an empty park, or beach is ideal (drive separately or have your own way of getting back home though). DO NOT RIDE TOGETHER! If raining or snowing outside, I recommend going over to their spot. This will make it easier to excuse yourself. Do not invite them over to your place! You will have a hard time getting them to leave.<br>  Step3<br>  3) APPEARANCE...<br>  Remember before you two first went out on a date and it took you 2 hours to get ready? Well this would be the total opposite. When breaking up with someone, its considerate to look the part of a person who doesn't enjoy breaking the bad news. Don't get all dolled up or look as though you're ready to go out right after. That will only make the dumpee more upset that you're already moving on and out n about. While giving people the boot is cold blooded in itself you still need to be respectful of their feelings. If you can look your worse, do so.<br>  Step4<br>  4) WHAT TO SAY<br>  First off, before you open a mouth full of pain, apologize. Its the best way to start off the conversation. It goes something like this, " John/Jane, I wanted to tell you how I've been feeling lately about us. First off I would like to thank you for allowing me a moment in your life. Although we had many memorable moments, we also have differences which prevents me from allowing us to move forward. Lately I don't feel I'm 100%.Its not fair for you to be with someone like me who's not fully there. When I'm with someone I want to give that person my best and I'm sorry to tell you but I'm not at my best and I don't feel I'm that person. You deserve more and somewhere out there,that person is waiting for you to give you their best".

If you decide to have sex, that is your choice but I am just telling you from one girl to another that this seems like what his motive is.
rIzx4OEWaa	Hello in need of, Have you given any thought to the idea he said what he did to gauge your answer? he might just possibly feel the same as you an was trying to find out how you really feel, perhaps you should be honest after all it is the only real way to finding out beside if he still feels this way at least you will have cleared the air an he will know for sure. ring him now an tell him or do so the first chance you get before it is to late. I once went out with a girl that was a friend an then w became much closer we decided to go out as a couple but after a while went back to being good friends. we both thought that we had way to many things in common an that was what brought us closer together but neither of us really fancied the other in the way we realised we should have the love we had was more like for a brother or sister an we decided to stand by each other but not to take it any further.

Of course, you can express to him how you feel about the whole situation and who knows, he may just feel the same way, after hearing your feelings toward him.

Sometimes we need to leave the past in the past & try to mend our torn family relations.|`|jfzSmuAcaa	I think you should ask to meet up somewhere, just start little by little.  It's always nice to have more people in your life.  I wouldnt worry about the rest of your family, if you want to reach out to your cousin, your family could also do the same, it doesn't have to be all on you. Just think about what kind of relationship you want to have with your cousin and let your cousin know.
VgiUGqxtaa	If he insists on friendship, then i think you should probably just leave him & move on, but threating him with the end of your friendship isnt right, because he might be forced into it, then deep into the relationship, you find he doesnt "love you" etc & you're left without a man or a friend..<br>  <br>  Soo yeah.. let that mellow|`|TsoXZKSyaa	but why would you waste a friendship just because you're looking for a relationship? Let him know you'll have to see him less because you don't have enough time to put aside for him if it's not going to turn into anything else, but don't break it off entirely :(, not if you both enjoy eachothers company. You can find another guy to love, but if you're still just friends then you should keep that friendship, maybe down the road it will develop into something more, you never know, so keep it open (just a crack at the least) but make sure it's still there :). <br>  <br>  good luck to you!! :)
mFAJG2E8aa	Aha that's actually happened to me before...<br>  <br>  This totally ugly, rude guy texted me and was like, "Yeah I really like Mary Kate but I can't help but be mean to her cause I don't want her to know."<br>  <br>  And I replied back and was like, "I know now."<br>  So say something really smart-alack. (spelling?)<br>  <br>  Suggestions::<br>  <br>  - Yeah, I like (your name) too, he/she's really hott.<br>  - Oh my gosh girlfriend, we should totally go blog about it.<br>  Something else?

T5o0I4bOaa	Honestly, its not rude but she may be taken aback a bit, especially if the place is a casual one. If she makes a comment about it just say that you thought it'd be best since it was the first time meeting. If paying is what you're worried about, you should meet somewhere where you have to go to the counter to pay so you both could do that separately. Good luck!|`|4Ey6v8YBaa	If you don't want spendy, go for coffee.  It's just cheap of men to suggest a sit-down dinner with wait service and don't pay.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	you are real cheap if I go out on a date and wen the bill arrives I have to pay for half the bill I will ask the the server to itemize what I consume and I will pay only for my diner- so in other words<br>  you are expecting a piece of a--ss  for a lousy diner<br>    cheap stingy bastard|`|AA11447210	Whoever made the date should be prepared to pay and take the ticket. If the other person wants to offer to chip in, that's fine.<br>  <br>  If you wanted the meeting to be 'dutch' you should have made that clear at the outset. <br>  <br>  When you are dating someone and picking up the tab, you aren't sure where that is going either...or how long it will last (you just have hopes). By your reasoning, it should ALWAYS be dutch....which is fine, as long as you make that clear up front.<br>  <br>  A first meeting is likely to be coffee or a cocktail or two. Shouldn't be a big deal for a career person to pay the whole bill...there is a cost involved in finding love. ?|`|g65GVqnUaa	that is something you both should have agreed on before going out to dinner.<br>  So before the bill comes tell the server its seperate checks. An tell her you hope she does not mind going dutch. Yet if she gets upset then you know she was expecting you to pick the tab up because it was a date date.|`|vdT9VkZoaa	Take it all.<br>  and i am sure she will return the favor. lol. jk. <br>  But seriously women really do need a nice guy in there life. be a gentleman and take the bill. I hope it goes well.|`|AA10010935	There is nothing wrong with sharing the bill, but make sure you get that straightened out first before you even go on the date.|`|T7ANno5Qaa	Wrong. No offense, but trust me. Ladies like true, formal gentlemen. SO be a nice gentlemen and take the check!
u0JCNh8zaa	Funny, I just saw this question only it was a booty call instead.|`|2hMhANqDaa	He's probably just nervous and wondering if you feel the same way about him and he probably doesn't know what to say to you.<br>  On the other hand, that fact that you both were drunk may have made him feel like it was just a random hookup for YOU so he doesn't know if he'll be rejected when he calls.<br>  Wait another day or two and if he doesn't call, try to call him. If he doesn't answer or call back, he's not worth it.
AA11447210	Unless parents keep an eye on the kids 24/7, it's hard to prevent it. Dating one-on-one shouldn't occur before age 16, and sex shouldn't occur before age 18. Kids younger than that hanging out and calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend is fine...it's a learning ground for what's to come. <br>  <br>  With their hormones raging as they pass through puberty, it's virtually impossible to get them (boys and girls) to ignore each other. The only way to decrease them getting involved on some level would be segregation.<br>  <br>  As for them being "in love", that won't come for many years down the road...but the infatuations they have feel like love to them, and hurt when they end. Just because an emotion isn't mature love doesn't mean it doesn't feel strong to the people that experience it. When they look back on their teen years though, after they are adults and in long term relationships, they'll understand the difference in what they felt for a boy or girl at 13 or 16 and what they feel for the man or woman in their life in their 30s. No comparison...|`|53sVKcOeaa	Its a part of growing up although many kids now-a-days have sex as well which isn't a good idea because they aren't aware of the risks. However relationships teach kids how to be independent and how to love in later life. I never had a relationship till i was 16 and now i'm 17 and we're still together so i must be doing something right. It's the way of the world i guess|`|zGthY1Jeaa	Its not young love its young  lust. When your that young u dont know the meaning of tru luv. Quite frankly I dont think they should have a relationship at that age, their mentality are not ready for it. Im 17 by the way, although i have a bf I consider myself ready for a bf. but it doesnt bother me the least wen i dont have one. And heartbreak at 13?? its possible. But what do i no?|`|sjYnhV9naa	my opinions r it is awesome when starting love at 15 n even if it is hurt when breaking up, it doesn't last long neither deep. <br>  A great way to grown up n getting valuable experiences|`|uLHtXibRaa	Its not love when your that young ..|`|AA11263103	They are too young, just love being a kid. and in middle school isn't about have first kisses or boyfriends that is what high school and college is for.i am 15/16 and i haven't gotten my first kiss. and I fine with that. School is more important then friend/bf/gf. Young kids haven't gone to high school and college then is when you should be love .  Enjoy being  a kid.. when in high school, some kids don't have time for that. lol
SzubaKbuaa	bring up a topic you guys had last night|`|pj02ePxAaa	wow...this happened to me like a week ago. the only advice i have is don't try too hard. it will turn out horribly if you over think it. trust me that's what i did. and it sucked. just be yourself and talk about the same things that you would talk about if you were im'ing. ?|`|buHzPMHZaa	Your online life is not the real one.

mYmR5cX5aa	Its about the game and getting what they want. The ultimate is getting the hot girl, but most importantly the challenge to "get it".|`|lM6vnhEraa	they'll sleep with any random "cute" girl just to get laid.  yeah.  then they eventually change though when they star tlooking for a real relationship...they still go after the cute girls haha|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	No, most players don't care about looks.

Just ask her that you would love to take her out sometime ONLY if she wants to. NO pressure!  If she sounded like she is willing to then give her a later date. <br>  If she said sorry she is seeing someone else, then just say ofcourse, as I said you are really a great person and any guy would be lucky to have you. But then pass her your number and say that if things did not work out then she may call you . Take care. And just leave it there. Dont be disheartened because she might get nervous and not accept your invitation at the beginning so be sure to give her your number or get her email address...and follow up If she was not dating anyone.<br>  <br>  Thats just my opinion..other than that your messgae sounds great! Good luck!|`|gRuTtwhoaa	If someone said that to me I'd definitely think about it! I think it's sweet and will definitely get her to consider you.

g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear that you are having a bad time with an ex-girlfriend, I have no idea why some girls act like that and I'm a female. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your situation was, but I'm assuming she did something messed up and then you guys broke up.<br>  <br>  I would be stern with her and let her know that she can't keep acting like this and that it's time to move on. She is just making herself seem worse by acting like this. If she wants to be with you, acting like that sure isn't the way to prove that she cares and wants to be with you, and you can even say that to her!<br>  <br>  You need to keep completely ignoring her. The more she sees that this is effecting you, even if it's negative, the more happy she is because that means she has control over you. It might not seem like it, but in a sense it's like she has you in a safety net, and by calling you and texting you all the time makes her feel like she still has you around, like she's holding on to a strand of hope.<br>  <br>  You need to delete her numbers, delete e-mails, everything. If you can block them that'd be even better. You just need to show her that you are over her and that this is done and that she can't keep acting like this because it's pathetic. The more you try to just ex her out of your life, the better, and the better off you will be.<br>  <br>  You said that she knows everyone you know, if they are your friends, (like guy friends) tell them to please be loyal to you and not mention you to her, or even speak to her. I'm a strong believer that if this girl met friends through you, that they are YOUR friends, and she has no business trying to talk about you or use them to get at you. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you are in a dorm or not, but if you are, you could get her into trouble for harassing you like that. But I think if you just try to ignore her the best you can and not act phased by this she should let off. Don't give her any kind of lead ons either. Like don't give in to answering her phone calls or texts. Completely ignore her. Once you answer the more crazier she will get because she will assume that you do want something to do with her.<br>  <br>  This is really the best advice I can give without knowing the complete situation of you two, but I hope this helps out some. I wouldn't go back to dating her for future notice :-) Good luck with everything, all the best!|`|vpzAEph9aa	sit her down and tell her honestly why you don't want to talk to her. <br>  tell her you need space. try and be nice. if she doesn't listen, be more stern. <br>  <br>  now i'm guessing you probably have already tried telling her you want nothing to do with her, so the best bet, is to just not acknowledge her presence. eventually she'll give up. <br>  i would know, i'm a girl. <br>  <br>  or you can just be a total jerk to her.. but this i do not recommend, for it can end badly. but hey, it's up too you.<br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|HFENQXABaa	Man, you ain't doing it right.  i kno what you like.  you just dont wanna deal with it so it just makes you angry that you dont have the space.  i like my space too<br>  <br>  but you gotta do it right.  you gotta sit down before things get outta hand.  even if you dun wanna, she the type so let her.  ignoring her ain't gunna do much, but you'll lose respect from mutual friends.  trust me, i've had it happen to me.  i learned the hard way, and i regret it cuz people just think i did wrong .<br>  <br>  and if she appologizing, then just recognize it.  she kno she f'ed up.  i tried ignoring and being a jerk to my ex, and my life became f'ed up.  i dun wanna bore you but mutual friends are a *****. <br>  <br>  but then i met a girl who changed my life, and i've met friends who'll stick wit me.  we once got into a fight so bad and so instead, i walkd out for an hour, called her after, sat down and talked.  <br>  <br>  it aint about getting back together. it just gives her a reason to be ok givin u space.  jus talk, u never kno<br>  <br>  after that, my gf n i have been chill ever since n <br>  she even good in many ways if u kno whad i mean!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|T2o9ptUlaa	to her face. tell her to leave you the eff alone|`|1u79cBlZaa	RUN WHY U HAVE A CHANCE!

AA10913583	I think your parents have really higher hopes in you and that's the reason why they cannot accept your boyfriend. They think you could do better. You should really show your parents that he is the person you want to be with and that no matter what living class you will be, you will be happy because you found the man of your dreams.|`|SzQi9N7daa	Here's the short answer.  If you two are really meant to be your college career shouldn't make a difference.  Go to school, get your education and be prepared to be a viable contributor.  Liking your boyfriend is one thing, respecting him is another.  Your grandparents may simply chose not to get in the middle of the argument.  If your BF respected your parents he would consider what they want and how both of you would benefit from what they ask. Honestly, what this tells me is that a rebellious little girl is going to get married to spite them or to "prove them wrong". Time will tell if they are right or wrong, so too will it blur some of the facts. <br>  <br>  I know this isn't what you want to hear but it is truthful.  Go to school, better yourself or yourselves. Doing so gives you a much better foundation to start a life together and a family.  As I said earlier, a couple of years at 19 is the blink of an eye and should not have any effect on your relationship with your bf.  Often times the right thing to do is the thing we want to do the least and we know it. Take it from someone who got married very early.  Had we both to do it again, we both agree we would have done school first and then gotten married. <br>  <br>  Chose wisely and logically, leave your heart out of this decision. <br>  <br>  Good Luck

5rRgcedhaa	still be friends with him  but move on be less available if he really likes you he will come looking for you and if not u will prob find someone better by moven on|`|dYGLyVpzaa	The same thing happened to me! This guy sounds like he's getting cold feet for some reason, it could be the time apart or it could be something else. I handled it by sending a very frank text asking him what was going on between us, and well it didn't turn out too well, so I wouldn't advise you do the same! Instead of asking straight out like that you could hint as to whats going on - he owes you to tell you as its not fair to string you along. If this behaviour keeps happening then find someone more worth your time :) you could send him a flirty text but it could come across as you being a tad too strong in your affections. But after all its up to you! Just don't let a guy mess you around, its not worth the hassle. Good luck!|`|9RWjoJd9aa	play it coooool<br>  maybe you should pretend like you dont care?<br>  play hard to getttttt ;)
cgQrQSvDaa	she must just be embarassed about it is all I think i would be too.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well, your friend was in a very bad, dark place when she said what she did. Perhaps she's feeling better now and doesn't care to reminisce? I certainly dont' like thinking about or talking about all the times I've been suicidal. She may be embarrassed as well...some people are, after they've said something so extreme. Just try not to worry about it too much...she wants to let it go, so let it go.<br>  <br>  Just be her friend; let her know that if she ever needs to talk or anything that you're there for her. Hopefully, if she ever starts to feel that way again, she'll come to you.|`|kvcIdORcaa	maybe she blocked it out or doesn't want to acknowledge that it happened because it's a painful/hurtful/embarrassing/shameful memory for her. just drop it and let it go|`|rAS9n75laa	theres a couple reasons why she is lying.<br>  one might be because she really doesnt remember<br>  another might be because she doesnt want to talk about it.<br>  she also could be embarrassed about it.<br>  like, she may feel that if she says that she had thought about suicide, it would make her weak.<br>  theres many different reasons on why she could be lying.|`|24384049d41e4b2011721c3e776b0ff4aa	Same thing happened to me accept she wanted to jump of a bride which I had to talk her down from.  Very scary to see someone go through that.  She should talk to someone and if she is in denial then just be there for her.|`|2WheRqWwaa	she is obviously embarrassed and doesn't want to talk about it. you should probably tell someone though because talking about suicide is very serious.
4rLdaCNHaa	God, is not punishing you..."YOU" are punishing you!!<br>    And your loosing because the program stinks!<br>     First, you put him out, then you see what his priorities are, you or the addiction.<br>     Doesn't matter how many addictions or what he is addicted too...The choice isn't blinded by the smoke or the blur of alcohol, he has a goal to reach and that should give him the drive and ambition to fight for you and sobriety. <br>     All you did was enable, even if you thought you were fighting it, you were enabling at the same time, talk about mixed signals.<br>     The bible says plenty in the behaves of a family and it isn't that you live or forgive it, God says plenty about the protection of your life, mentality and happiness, he has plenty to say about having the inner strength and ability to walk away, he speaks of "self" love as well.<br>     Christianity has a problem with suicide, remember?, and what you doing is a form of suicide, is it not?<br>      Just because you love someone, does not make them good for you and when love causes more misery than it does love, then it's time to walk because the bible will tell you "Love" is what holy matrimory is all about.<br>     The bible is a book of meditation, one needs to read the situations, information, lessons, knowledge and advice, for themselves. It is not at all unusual that 2 ppl read the same verse and find different answers or views on its meaning. This is why christianity has divided so much and into so many different sects.<br>     Try reading it for yourself, ppl who teach it often infer and instil their own versions of what is said or to be taken from it.<br>     But, all in all, you've given your all and done enough, now it's time to save yourself, so get what you feel is yours and get out.<br>     Maybe it's the lords way of saying he needs to stand on his own two feet, now.|`|laHLW1yQaa	Just go.

You cant change them, only they can change tthem self Until then your better off leaving while you can. When he is out, get what you can, even get a friend with a ute or van, or hire one, grab whatever you can and go to a friends house, rrefuge or find a house to rent before you leave so you have some where to go. <br>  Hope i was helpful<br>  xox|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	just go .. get your stuff later .. with help .. get a friend to help you with that .. but just go .. and be happy for once .. then party ..thats its over with .. good luck to you and to hell with him ..

She might feel more relaxed around you and the kiss might come more naturally. But be patient with her, she's said she wants to get to know you more. She might have been hurt in a previous relationship so take it slowly and be patient.|`|XC7JPHKDaa	why rush things so fast. If you really liked her for who she was and NOT how she kissed, you would listen to her and get to know her better. It will be worth the wait.

xBOSZPZTaa	If you love him don't let him go. Date other people and when he comes back if you still feel tha same pick up where you left off.|`|d16sM2iOaa	If you guys really believe in what you have going, you definitely shouldn't have broken up just because he's moving away. You both haven't dated anyone else so you both are very special to each other and that's something you NEVER want to lose. If he is worth it, and he thinks that you are worth it, STAY TOGTEHER. The fact that he is moving away will really test the dedication between the both of you. This can be a good thing, and will give you both some space. If you are going to decide to continue the relationship you just both need to be 110% into it.<br>  <br>  If it's worth it, never EVER let it go.|`|093adb8ec6136150f94ebe4b7a62899eaa	Let him go.... it is possible you will get back together, but if you have never dated other people, now is the time to check that out. I have never understood why women/girls hook themselves up with one guy and think thats all there is in the world. Now is the time to see if what you are getting from him is really all that good, or if you have had the "love" goggles on all this time. <br>  <br>  No harm in staying in contact, as I said you both may find that you are each others future, but go out and find out for sure before committing to one person.|`|VnJuLZEOaa	Well I have to say four hours away from each other is not far at all.<br>  Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 years as well, I live in BC and he goes to Toronto for a few months a year and we have never ever<br>  broken it off.<br>  <br>  I believe if you both truly love each other you both wouldn't even think about seeing other people because your connect should be strong.<br>  <br>  But I always believe as well that everything happens for a reason.<br>  <br>  If you still have feelings for him then keep it that way but wait to see what time does for you. Maybe in a week you lose interest in him and move on.<br>  <br>  If you both broke up then theres no harm done seeing other people.|`|GWveqx61aa	if you love him dthen fight for him, 4 hours isnt long, you can drive there to see him or vice versa, there is a quote if you love him set him free,if he comes back its meant to be. well what if he dont come back, are you going to be happy knowing you could have done something to stop him from straying, follow your heart and do what you think is best for the 2 sof you, good luck|`|riRwgNNaaa	i would say fight for ur relationship dont just walk away from someone without trying to make it work because sometimes we think the grass is greener on the other side but most of the times we find that the on the other sides grass is dead ,remember the works of two are better than those of one best of luck to u|`|ltIudMNUaa	It depends if he is the right person.

But if you still have feelings for him, why let him go?|`|4dZN9dgGaa	let him go.<br>  take an adventure<br>  try someone else|`|jqsu76T5aa	hold on to him <br>  til u hear something.|`|L7VE4Vfjaa	have sex with him then move on|`|OlGple7haa	I honestly don't think you should hold on to a person if they don't want to be in the relationship anymore. It's not to say that he doesn't love you but you clearly stated that he is moving 4hrs away (it's hard to maintain a long distance relationship if the both of you are at odds) and both of you wanted to be single to date others. If that is something that is apart of the reason you are breaking up, then it might be best to let go. It would be really hard to hold on to him and he is going to be meeting new people, in a new environment and at the same time, knowing that he may meet someone. It could possibly make your relationship vulnerable to unintentional lies to keep from hurting each other's feelings. Have you ever heard the saying "if you love something let it go...if it was meant to be, it will come back to you." I believe if you two really love each other and keep a geniune relationship (being honest with one another), it's possible that the two of you may get back together later. It may be good for the both of you to experience life with other people--meaning: dating, going out and just having a good time. From my personal experience...if a man wants you...he will definitely come back to you. Good luck sweetie!<br>  Again...I repeat...never try to "hold on" to someone that isn't "holding on" to you! If he wants you he will be with you, no matter where he is.|`|Ogs7JdDnaa	it's tough to be in a committed relationship while you are away from each other, especially in while in school.. would recommend to leave separate lives for a while, and if it's destined you will be together again|`|31gN5L58aa	tell him how you feel~that's all there is to it...<br>  and...<br>  please answer!!!:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqXscsqeOelY77_mey7aAfnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221170522AAO85T9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|VbFEvDL7aa	He broke up with you, or you him?<br>  <br>  If it was him, let him go.|`|dF5clN4daa	How can you be so sure of how you "ex" feels?<br>  <br>  I think you ought to continue as you are.  But if you really feel that you can't live without him and he feels the same way about you then why not get married?<br>  <br>  Or is your relationship with Him truly one of convenience.. you know - you get all the practices of marriage without the commitment?  I hope not.  In this case the relationship will be truly inconvenient since it is four hours away.  Again, not a good idea to hold on.  If two persons cannot be faithful to each other then how can a "long-distance" relationship change anything?|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	You can try holding on to him...but you may end up hurt in the end. Long distance relationships don't really work unless both parties are completely committed. If you think there is a chance for you two, then hold on to him. If not, let him go. Talk to him and ask him if there is a possibility of getting back together. See what he says. If not, let the boy go and find yourself someone else to love and be with. Good Luck xoxo|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	well, if he's only going to be gone for a year why let go of him forever?<br>  i mean, if you really love eachother i think you should stay together, but if you think that he's going to move on then you should too.<br>  but ultimately, if you think things will change between you two while hes gone, i say then move on.|`|EkzTAryEaa	hold on to him, 4 hours is not that bad<br>  he can always come back and visit once in a while<br>  and yall can tough it out for a year|`|MXGFGBtZaa	If you love each other and want to be together and not see other people tell him that is unnatural for you to be in this position. You should be together until the love is gone or one of you decides there is no love in the relationship.<br>  It's weird for you to hurt yourself like this, making your single status very contrived.<br>  Go for it. Try to make it work. If there is absolutely no hope, move on.|`|RXBb8kx7aa	Do you plan on staying with this guy for the rest of your life and possibly persuing marriage? If you think and feel he is your mate for life, then certainly keep ahold of him. If you can't picture yourself spending the rest of your life with this person, it might be best to just move on and find the person who you do want to spend forever with.|`|01226d8ec80c366c666cfd6e8058d061aa	Sounds bizarre to me. Even if you two were to break up once he moves, if y'all love like you say, why wouldn't y'all try to spend every moment t'gether til that fateful moment?<br>  On the flip side, what's the use of holding on to him if he obviously don't intend t'hold on to you?|`|HC6rrHLDaa	I think you should hold on to him until he comes back. You can date other people like you said yourself. But wait until he comes back and try dating. If it doesn't work out then you can break up for good.|`|6smOAbzLaa	No.  He may eventually comeback if you don't pressure him.|`|YaFKI2lxaa	Completely let him go.|`|OntO6wE4aa	He wants to date other people.

bZud91iuaa	Well you asked for it...most men, not all, so I'm probably going to catch some flack for this, don't want a girlfriend.  It's too restricting.  What they want is a main squeeze they can call anytime and you'll jump and come running.  Come on guys admit it.  Some do want a committed relationship as we get older, but not in the late teens and early twenties. Ask this question of yourselves, " If I could be with another woman and I was guaranteed I would not get caught, would I do it?" If you're really honest you know the answer.  This is of course not always true, but it's what I've seen and experiencedand unfortunately I'm a lot older than most of you, happily married etc.  So take it for what it's worth ladies.  We're not all bad.|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	ive wondered the same thing, but backwards.  My ex says that she didnt really want a relationship, she was happy to be alone, sex didnt matter, etc etc.  Of course, what she meant was that she didnt want these things with me, she was getting it elsewhere from other guys at the time.  None of this made me happy, being alone sucks, being alone while having a gf who is cheating on you sucks even more.

rqJSk1omaa	Don't go to the administration because you might get yourself in the middle of a situation that could get ugly. You probably don't wanna have to end up making statement to the police and stuff. What I would do is tell everyone that you know she is stealing, like all your real friends. Spread the rumor around school so people know to watch out. Tell some people that got stuff stolen. Let it out. I hate people who steal.|`|vlov9wqiaa	What a weak insipid person you are when you know what is going on and do nothing about it.If it breaks your heart that much do something about it as soon as you can and become a better person
M1PYqC3qaa	You can't kiss a girl on the cheek and expect people to believe you don't like her.<br>  Its nice when you're saying goodbye, or if you hug her, and then just as you part, peck her on the cheek. If you just do it out of the blue it can be a bit creepy.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Who are you kidding?|`|StHedcXtaa	wat? I dont understand your question, clarify that, please.|`|JJMa25NWaa	hm, when you're coming out of a hug, or cuddling?|`|QHnS31Scaa	when ever you want its always cute just dont over do it
vnJG8UYJaa	You might try talking to her and letting her know that she is putting a lot of pressure on you and it is stressing you out.  Give her a chance to express her concerns and be a good listener.  I'm sure she sees a lot of potential in you and only wants to be supportive.<br>  <br>  In the end, it is your life and your choice as to your behavior and your grades.  You need to figure out what kinds of things motivate you and discuss that with your parents.  Let your teacher know that if you need any help, you will come to her.<br>  <br>  This is a nice way of telling her to back off without telling her off.<br>  <br>  I do hope you appreciate the interest she has taken in your school career.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|g0XjuvBfaa	she might just care...turn in your homework...social expectations?...that is all...|`|9QKqs2zNaa	just tell her she is going too fast....

There is only one place to go from there and honestly she probably thinks she's ready, but she's not. Keep things innocent as long as possible!!! Just trust me!|`|wBSkGfxjaa	Age should make no difference in how to do it or being a good age to do it.  But she is a bit young to be experimenting like this.  I say "experimenting" because it would be better if there was a more mature emotional connection.  Advise her to go slowly -- in all ways.|`|GEd48C24aa	that is pretty younq .<br>  but im not the one to be talkinq.<br>  ha , if its somethinq shes really ready for ,<br>  then let her be . it not , she'll learn from<br>  her mistakes. beinq sexually activee,<br>  is a biq step for teens.|`|RSwlw4lMaa	well it is kinda young <br>  but if thats what she wants to<br>  do then you have to let her<br>  do her thing,<br>  but dannnnnnngggg<br>  if i was the kid<br>  YESSSS<br>  i would love one :D<br>  <br>  (im 17 kk?)
ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	and you are such a child. 15 years old. and engaged. <br>  <br>  wait till you are a grown up you will understand then how ridiculous this really is. and how childish as well|`|hLohtlPEaa	Maybe it's time for a pre-engagement. You are not as mature as you think you are, because of your age. No insult intended. You need to get through high school and college yet. Give yourself time to mature.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	too young.  plain and simple.  you havent been in the real world yet.  what happens if you meet someone in college?  or one of you gets a job or something that moves you across the country?  all sorts of **** can happen.<br>  <br>  too young.  i know thats not what you wanna hear but its the truth|`|1oj4aamaaa	Play the field.  He should too.  I'm happy that I tried many pink slices before I found the one that fits just right.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	just as long as you and your fiancee are happy that's all that matters|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Ask most 20 year olds and they are NOT the same person at all that they were when they were 18 let alone 15. People change so much in high school and even more once they graduate. Sometimes it works out, but most of the time people just change and i have floated away from my best friends even. I am so glad i didnt marry my bf of 2 years when i was 18 because I just changed so much. I am not saying it wont work, i just mean that i know a lot of people that dated for longer than 3 years throughout high school and jr high and stuff and they broke up and it was for the better. I would DEFINITELY wait until you are 19-20 at the soonest. It doesnt matter what your title is, but i probably would have rather it been a promise ring at such a young age rather than an engagement...|`|1M90Aoytaa	i dont understand long engagments with no set date - who are you 'proving' your commitment to? each otehr? are you not secure enough without a title to say it? in my opinion if your not setting a date for your wedding your not really engaged - it really irritates me when people get engaged with no actual plans to get married the 'we are engaged but we dont know if/when we will get married' its very childish and you might say your old for your age but it sounds very childish tbh. up most respect for being together 3yrs already but you might find it changes if one goes away to university? why dont you wait unitl your old enough to actually get married before you get engaged, you might think your serious but no one will take you seriously at 15!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	If you are happy together go for it.<br>  <br>  I met my current boyfriend (who I want to marry and stay with for the rest of my life - he feels the same thank god!!) when I was only 17 and I thought I was too young to settle down.  We broke up and I went out with different men and 'played the field'  Not one of them compared with him and I wasted ten years of my life not being with him.  We got back together the week before my 27 birthday over a year ago.  <br>  <br>  Go for it and congratulations|`|E2aN3ZBaaa	that's  really sweet of him to ask u to marry him<br>  but u know wait till u get older, there are other ways to show love, marriage just make your relationship legal<br>  to show and feel love you could do other things such as be always together trust one another<br>  and all that<br>  wait a little bit more :)<br>  <br>  anyways i think that's really sweet|`|ASJlcmTgaa	Too young in my opinion.  You have so much more in life to change, grow up, see and do.  You are still in school and there are so much in life that can move you appart.  I personally think it is too early.  Trust me at you age I thought I was so grown up but now that I am 23 I look back and realsie how much I have still changed etc.|`|NX9Dj2qraa	If i were you, dont listen to what people think of it on here, because they dont know you or your fiance personally.<br>  You are very young though, but as i said, we dont know you and you did mention you are very mature.<br>  So best of luck and Congrats! x|`|d1f4428d3bd66886014cedd35e30d605aa	good luck, and hopefully it will stand the tests of time!|`|2MdtxjEAaa	In my opinion that is too early. Yall are young. I would say promise right first until yall are atleast 18.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	i think you are too young|`|Z21YpqQDaa	Personally I think you are way too young to be considering marriage! At 15 or 16, be you mature for your age or not, you've barely experienced the world. You've so much to learn about yourself over the next few years and with that in mind, it really is no time to commit to someone. <br>  <br>  You do sound like a cute and very in love young couple, and by all means you should enjoy your relationship, but bare in mind that your commitment's unlikely to last!|`|1UHDLGLlaa	2 people from my school got engaged at 15/16.<br>  They where  kind of seen as a joke by everyone.<br>  But they where pretty immature about it....<br>  If it's what you both want, wheres the harm in it?<br>  You seem to have a strong relationship & thats all that really matters.<br>  By the time you are ready to get married you can always review the situation.<br>  <br>  I have friends whose parents got married at 17... & they met at school.<br>  It's no different really... like when you think back to how young people would have children & get together years ago... times have changed & attitudes have changed with time.<br>  <br>  If it makes you happy, go for it ;)|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Congratulations on such a long teen relationship! Understand, though, that most teens do eventually break up. There is a whole world of handsome men out there. Your boyfriend may be the love of your life. Just give it some time and enjoy each day with him. Do not rush into anything or be pressured into anything. Take your time and be patient. You are way too young, no matter how mature you think you may be. Wait until you finish college before marriage. You will not regret it.|`|9ec35143f058d939ec20e181bffccf95aa	I think a nice promise ring would be nice...Not an engagement ring...It shows your love but is not binding...You are both too young to be thinking of marriage...You will have many loves before you settle on one..If he is the only one for you then do it right...Go steady,  15 to 16 years.then a promise ring at 17 to 18 years and if you still want to marry then an engagement ring is fine at 19...Get your education..That will ensure at least one of you will be able to get a job and take care of the other...Babies cost money.., and if your married, hummmm that can happen anytime...Slow down...|`|ef06pzBQaa	Well for my oppinon I  think you are too young to even be considering getting married . Your still in highschool and have your whole life ahead of you . And a cometment like this is a big deal well a hudge deal. I thinnk you should wait till you get out of highschool  to even get engaged. You might be truly in love now but think about 20 years from now... I think you should wait till end if highschool to get engaged then middleish college if that's evn in the plain to get married..... Hope I helped (:|`|smvFVN7haa	How Old Is This Guy ???<br>  And By The Sounds of Things ,, I Think You Guys Are Completly Made For Each Other !! <br>  If Any People I Kno At The Age Of 15, Got Asked To be Married,, I Reckon They Would Have To 'Consulte Their Girlyyfriends At This Weeks Sleepover First' ..

AA10010935	I wouldn't associate with people who aren't nice to me.    I wouldn't be rude to them, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to be nice to them.   What makes people like that so important?   You can do better than them.|`|qDYSgGu5aa	dude, just ignore their shitty@sses xD..|`|92fNY4Fvaa	just ignore them<br>  they aren't worth it :)|`|VjMyHAWraa	Simple ...don't!

I used to go through the same thing but I asked them why they invited everyone else but me. They told me cause they thought I didn't want to join them. So just ask them it's all worth it trust me. ^-^|`|Sl6ZmBFWaa	friendship is a two way thing.

I have a few good guy & girl friends but it stays that way and i dont usually go hanout with anyone different that i already know.  Id hangout with you anytime, too bad we most likely dont live close.  move here lol.   :)|`|04F4149yaa	If you want people to ask you to go places ask people to hang with you. Put yourself out there or you will go unnoticed :P|`|OyOQES3paa	maybe you just need to prove that you can be fun. just be yourself but go looking for friends instead of waiting for friends to come to you|`|AA10321221	That's a very difficult question to ask total strangers. So...why don't you ask the very same people that you feel shunned from?|`|EL9PhkNBaa	Maybe you should ask them to come over to your house or to go-over to their house. People sometimes think that you don't want to hang out with them if you are just waiting for them to ask you. However, if you think that they just don't like you anymore, try to find other friends. And don't be sad! Sometimes people think differently when you are acting different!|`|WM8QRcdMaa	dearr, not to be rude, but im guessing your attitude. i just saw one of your other questions, and you were accusing girls of copying your style and othershit like that. you sound very conceited and full of yourself. i wouldn't wanna hang out with you either....sorry but thats just my opinion|`|AA12260791	Well, my urself noticable.

Ig0nRZlgaa	If you have sent the message that you are available for sex, then you can expect to be just that. If you want to know if you matter---then don't give in.<br>  <br>  Do not set yourself up to be used.

A7nIADxgaa	Most of the time, you kind of mean what you say when your drunk.<br>  <br>  Anyways, tell him that you thought well about it and a daughter isn't a problem at all. Tell him also that you love him, that you would like a second chance and would be pleased to meet his daughter.
A7nIADxgaa	Cute convo ^^<br>  <br>  He might like you. Tell him that you like him and would like to go out with him but he has a girlfriend and at that moment you can't do anything about it. <br>  <br>  <br>  You don't need to say it exactly like this, say it in your words and how you feel personally about it.

It's not fair of her to behave like this and you deserve better. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't have beaten her up though, and maybe if you apologise to her then it will make things a bit better.

P.S. if she is a real friend why is she telling your other friends not to be friends with you|`|DxL3u9spaa	you are only in the 3rd grade. if you are thinking this is bad, then just wait till you get to high school.<br>  <br>  don't worry about it just relax and take life as it comes.(in high school too)
sr7jX2wYaa	Depends if  they are your friend,  or  just someone you know, or someone you don't  know as to what it means , & how it was said. & what you did  for them to call you that.<br>  Some people say it  because they think it makes them some kind of  big shot to call someone that*|`|pxEoQ1IWaa	I'd guess that they didn't like you very much.|`|6gthdHpnaa	It means they're too dumb to come up with anything original.|`|Au7GEfQiaa	yeah it typically means that.|`|AA11108018	It means that they were upset with your action or what may have done to them|`|QQ9ClIIJaa	it means that ur an idiot or u did something really stupid|`|7NwfwWAbaa	well, in what way did your friend use it? was it said in a joking manner, or was it in a harsh, angry manner?<br>  because if it was used jokingly then it's probably nothing, but if it's used again you have to stop it sometime.<br>  but if it was used in pissed off terms then you probably did something to anger the person that said it. so if this is the case, figure out what you did and do whats needed to make sure it doesn't happen again.|`|FPY9Zch2aa	It depends what you did to make them say that. But you should probably just ignore them.|`|aMqYdO0vaa	It means they are a idiot. They don't know what they are saying. You cant call someone a "f*ck".
NQFV2AdZaa	That's great, i hope it all goes well for you!
FZKFLTyLaa	I would quit worrying about it. It sounds like infatuation, not love
qgr0sT8naa	i'm a 16 yr old girl dating a 15 year old boy and nobody really cares, i've gotten more grief from people over the fact that he's white and i'm indian than our age differce|`|P92Kmqbhaa	it's cool ur waiting a few years, because 13 is kinda young to date. no, it's not strange at all, and i don't think people will tease u later on
hz7Ek1HKaa	dude that's why you don't wait to have sex after marriage!!|`|yVmcIAEdaa	No way, there are a lot more than 12,000 wrongs for everybody (and thankfully more than one "right" person for each person too).  But, if one is looking for another, all he/she needs to do is find one special person to make to make them happy.|`|AA10339039	I agree with the 12,000 wrongs...but I think it's short-sighted to think that there's only one person on earth for each of us.  I don't believe in "soul mates", just differing levels of compatibility.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	After doing the online dating, I would agree totally.  I went out with countless of those 12,000 men on one time dates.  But it only took one really good date to say the right one was there, he was one of only a few who got a second date... he is also now my husband.
5c6F8ogkaa	it would seem weird. but depends how old they were. like if there adults then not so weird but teens- i wouldnt accept unless there were more people so it wasnt so personal.|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	I don't think so as long as her bf is okay with it and as long as she doesn't get too involved with the other guy.|`|01ec5b9cdec921ba8997a4653b265e95aa	If the guy and the girl are friends then no, it's not wrong for her to accept -- even if she knows he's in love with her.  But, as long as they are going "as friends".  And she should definitely not be leading this guy on.  She needs to make it clear, if she hasn't already yet, that they are just friends.|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	Yes, because he'll think it's an invitation for something more and he'll think that she secretly does like him, no matter what the girl says. You can't accept things like that, they get misunderstood.
hHSsMyNpaa	My guess he is torn between you and his other (girl ? or guy ?) or someone he is taking care of like a parent ot something ?|`|mYmR5cX5aa	He needs to get over someone else before he gets closer to you. <br>  His problem, not yours. Give him time to come around, but do not push.|`|kqxddLNoaa	If you were really close then he should be comfortable enough with you to tell you what's wrong. Maybe sit him down and just talk about stuff, then casually drop that subject in the conversation. I'm sure it is nothing to do with you if you've done nothing wrong. Sometimes boys can get emotional like us girls, so there may be nothing wrong. My advise is just to try your best to talk to him and don't make him feel uncomfortable because he will not tell you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  :)|`|I3Ywzvwcaa	umm he has to tell you sometime. hes just starting drama! really why would you tell a girl that your crying and then not tell her why! don't talk to him for a wile until he can't handle it anymore and tells you. this kind of stuff really bothers me! i have the same problem. ugh <br>  GOOD LUCK! (;|`|nUDdh5Iqaa	?|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Perhaps there is another woman in his life.  And he doesn't feel entirely  free to be close to you.

mE0N72spaa	I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think you're oing to have to let her go. She obviously likes this other guy lot - if you like her enough you will accept her decision and let her get on with it. Try and focus on other things and other girls - keep yourself busy and keep your eye out for other girls - try and crush on someone else :) <br>  <br>  good luck, it's not a nice position to be in but sadly there's not much you can do.. if she's ignoring you, you should at least confront her about it. <br>  xxxx|`|ZguWpBvtaa	You can't "get" someone to like you or talk to you. It's a choice they have to make for themselves. All you can do is try to be friendly and if they respond then they want to have something to do with you, if they don't respond then maybe you have to move on.|`|3QNPMVd5aa	she doesnt want to wast her time again, just let the her move on, she gave you a chance and it wasnt meant to be<br>  <br>  sorry:(<br>  <br>  help me too(pics)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ata8lHxDqVLlICJo.KnXaonsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222103751AAeJ087">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|nabEAdD4aa	then maybe there is no point, just move on if she is far from interested<br>  and your relationship was so long ago so it makes sense if she's moved on since then, you just need to also, sorry|`|T5iPBCYsaa	Roofies|`|GqViUloFaa	I mean you cant force some one yo like u...she has yo like you on her own...just be your self and if she doesnt notices you its her lost!|`|pJsGF9sxaa	be your self and if she right for you she will come to you|`|9khDFRD7aa	Move on!!!!|`|IvT6AIXtaa	I'm sorry to say it but you can't make someone like you.

VcIg1R1zaa	he may think that it's sensible that if you both like each other and you have admitted it,you're a couple.you can always ask him what's going on between you and him

lJRrSBOWaa	Well it depends on your age, so if your a teenager in highschool make sure you dont go off and have sex. Maybe he's horny too... Maybe he still likes you I dunno, have you ever considered that you liked him still. Asking what you wear at night, souds like he was jerking off or something. like Phone sex:S talk to him about it. I dont think he knows that your getting HOT for him, but i think he thinks your flirting... <br>  <br>  honestly best thing to do is talk to him, but dont tell him your horny|`|3FObuZekaa	let him go!!!<br>  <br>  dont talk to him again|`|v398Qalyaa	hell yes, he knows!! he is enjoying the game, don't fall for his lines|`|BgZA7lvQaa	Yes, he knows exactly what he's doing.  I take it you two didn't have sex since you don't know the size of his dick.  I would have him commit to a relationship (if you really like him) because he is only going to use you.  Otherwise he only thinks you're only good enough for sex.  He wont take you out anywhere, he wont buy you a thing.  There will be no intimacy or true friendship because to him you are not worth it.  You'll be just a piece of meat.|`|uBmomdQCaa	From what you're writing, it seems like you know what to do yourself.<br>  If you REALLY REALLY want him, then just have sex with him and you'll see that the magic is gone.<br>  He probably just wants to get you in his bed, and he OBVIOUSLY likes making you horny..<br>  xx good luck<br>  dont give in!|`|Wf8PbTraaa	lol yeah he knows what hes doing now the question is whats his intentions with you.<br>  <br>  does he really like you or is he just tryin to get some....or both. <br>  <br>  i would guess a bit of both since he wants to be friends with benefits.|`|6wTfRlhlaa	the fact that he wants you be his friend with benefits just proves that he doesnt respect you. he wants sex. and even if he gets that out of you you'd still be seen as a friend.<br>  dont let him use you girl.|`|4rs0KXiTaa	who broke up with who? <br>  <br>  he sounds like a player... sorraay.. but, u should always take what your friends say to mind. it helps alloooottt
KTqdwG3Xaa	There will always be creepy guys wanted to stalk you and such. If you do not feel comfortable going back to this dude's bar then forgetta bout it.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	you cant stop it from happeneing just ignore him, and future creepy guys|`|llqoPwwsaa	scary wat ever you do dont date themm
xQtnTKCAaa	oh gosh first comment was amazing!!!<br>  okay back to the question. it really depends on the girl because a lot of people who want a serious relationship don't care about appearances. Yes,  its great to have someone good looking but what it really comes down to is personality. Since your cousin and the girl probably dont see each other much they both figured it wasn't going to be serious.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Uhhh... No.<br>  Your in a crazy land if you think thats true.|`|AA12103453	Sad isn't it? I know a bunch, if not all, women will deny this is true. Yet be a good looking guy and you can PROVE they just say that. They don't want to admit they have the same double standard that men have. I wasn't lucky enough to be born good looking like that either. Either it is because of lack of looks, or morals, I don't have interest in being a playa though. It will be interesting to see if ANY women admit they act this way, and if ANY admit that there are some women that act this way.|`|B7idbFNVaa	Am a guy so I won't know how to response.  But it is TRUE, if you're GOOD LOOKING you tend to get away with a lot of STUFF or less punishment for your action.  Then again these TYPE of GIRLS doesn't bother me that MUCH as the GIRLS who thinks they are TOO GOOD for YOU eventual they are NOT.|`|6e16f4069ecbb4c82031c4876c14f44faa	Yeah yeah whatever helps you sleep at night|`|6tGYe5roaa	I am not one of those girls who gives it up easily and it does not matter how good looking you are. You can use all the tricks you have, it ain't gonna work. In the end, looks are really not that important. Sure you need to be attracted to a person but personality really goes a long way. If someone is nice and funny, they will become more attractive if you get to know them. I cannot deal with obnoxious jerks.|`|p8otQ2vuaa	we don't want players but you can still have sex with your girl.<br>  only with your girlfriend and not with anyone else.<br>  if you want to end ur relationship cheat on your girlfriend and start another one.|`|A5HLjtqRaa	no its not!!!<br>  thts horrible!<br>  niether a boy or girl should do tht ****<br>  its worng to use ppl|`|kSFBMI6vaa	Those girls were just stupid and you dont have to be amazingly good looking. You just have to have a good personality and not be a jerk. Its a big turn off if the guy is a jerk, annoying, obnoxious, or someone with a bad personality. Just be a good guy. Not all girls are all about physical looks. You do have to have good hygene and dress nice most of the time but confidence will help too so work on your self-esteem
7VQv3cgoaa	Why didn't you just ask that person who said it?
T1j73RZpaa	I'm sorry to say you can't control your emotions or feelings. Although, maybe you could give up seeing him on a regular basis. To be honest though, i think there are more important & eaiser things you can give up such as, eating out at resturants (cause there are kids starving all over the world), eating unhealthy, soda, making fun of people, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|KcAehrrKaa	Lent is about sacrifice, if you're going to do it, try not to make a joke out of it.|`|pC1H7kO4aa	You can't just snap your fingers and NOT like someone that you originally really like.|`|6v3Xmzoqaa	Lent generally works better if you give up a concrete thing/activity so you can know for a fact if you are in violation of your sacrifice. So make a list of all the things involving this guy and your crush that you plan to give up. Some examples are:<br>  going on his facebook/myspace<br>  texting/iming him<br>  talking about him to your friends<br>  looking him up in the year book<br>  etc.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	I don't get it. Sorry, but all I can say is to be smart and follow your heart. Don't hold back, and do what you think you should do to get your way.|`|T7vuRDCVaa	That's not realy giving up something for Lent Darling. You never had him. You cannot give up something you don't have.|`|uHBa1f8aaa	will you be my mommy??|`|3E7EHc8faa	I'm having this same problem!<br>  <br>  For starters, if you have a Facebook and he's you're friend, ignore everything about him that comes up on your News Feed and never visit his profile. You'll find that you think about him less and less.<br>  <br>  You can also try checking out some other cute, single guys to get you're mind off of him.<br>  <br>  The best diagnosis for this type of problem is time. Time can heal just about anything.|`|hkqIeEvyaa	Ha, I'm trying to forget about my crush for Lent too. It's very hard, but you should remember that this sacrifice is for Jesus, and Jesus is way more important than him. Yeah, he's goodlooking or whatever, and maybe you're really attracted to him, but that's not what matters. When you find it too hard or it's too tempting to look at him, do a silent little prayer in your head. That guy you like isn't always going to be there for you, but God will. Good luck! =)|`|evTvNoF6aa	I don't think you can just suddenly will yourself to stop liking someone. I'd distance myself from him and try to talk to other guys or hang out with friends to get my mind off of him. Try something else more realistic for Lent though, like giving up soda or chocolate.|`|5eeae3fc5fa7f093e5dbb45d4e81ce8daa	well liking someone usually includes having lust for them so give up any felings of lust|`|EsYbiVJWaa	Well if your really need to give up Forget about it ignore him or mabey start going out with another guy|`|ifYAM8dnaa	suicide.|`|XykEfi76aa	Dangle his gonads.
GoU3DTmZaa	don't be upset, do you really want to meet a guy online? even if you like his blog still that's not something to make a man marriage material. don't take it as insult, you don't know the guy, there are plenty of valid reasons fro him not to message you back, and frankly if he did message you back i would be worried about his character. i know that i add people sometimes that i don't know, but i think i know them, accidents happen. there is an infinite amount of possibilities of why he isn't responding.|`|ZciTIyuCaa	Maybe he's been really busy. Give it a little more time. If he doesn't say anything then just remove him.
ephBKMthaa	Because we notice the little things about someone and there are times when those "little" things are annoying.  And to be honest we aren't as sensitive as most men.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Probably.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I don't like to generalise but its probably true.  Especially amongst female friends!  Unless as men we're misunderstanding whats happening.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	I don't think they are particularly more so than men.  I've got an uncle who is incredibly judgemental about everything.  I do have a religious female friend who is very judgemental but she is religious.<br>  Personally I don't judge anyone.  There's some crazy sh*t goes on in this town and certainly don't judge, I watch and smile.  Hurray for crazy people doing crazy stuff.<br>  I saw an old guy with a long white beard and long white hair dyed bright pink wearing a red cowboy hat and a long leather coat with red flames on the other day, how cool is that?

3wkIDiD8aa	It sounds like you really weren't taking his advice seriously. He's probably hurt that you don't care enough about his opinion to act on it, and that combined with the stress from work caused him to overreact.<br>  <br>  Apologize and and assure him that you really do appreciate his opinion, and the first step would be to start pushing the other girl out of your and his life.|`|bi4NGj8Iaa	Ok; now that you have discovered that he was right, go back to him: Crawl up in his lap, snuggle up, tell him he was right and apologize.

So don't get sad if she says something mean to you. As for your boyfriend, he gave you advise and that doesnt mean you have to take it. He just needs to grow up.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Nikki, you're boyfriend is right and realize this. She is only doing these things because she know's damn well its going to get back to you and it will bother you and it gets under your skin.

He offered advice, not an order.  It's your choice whether or not you accept it.  Tell him to grow up and get over it, and stop taking his problems out on you.|`|W6ZBPsVSaa	Just tell him that it not to big of a deal it your birthday and you can talk to however you want to.<br>  <br>  Tell him to lighten up.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Not be stupid when you ask him for advice and then just disregard it? <br>  <br>  How would you feel. it's not a very hard question in my opinion.|`|B65T6idIaa	well do him in bed get his mind ff things|`|AcL6nWkdaa	tell him him ur sorry u answered cuz u thought it was someone else or just tell him the truth|`|2ij4wwjgaa	o my effing goodness...<br>  if ur boyfriend was that mad that u didnt follow his advice<br>  then he should stop talking 2 her if she is doggin u like that...really....<br>  they both sound kinda 2-faced 2 me...<br>  you should tel him that...<br>  i know u dont wanna make him mad but the truth isnt always what ppl WANT 2 hear...<br>  u needa tell him wat he NEEDS 2 hear...that he shouldnt be gettin mad over petty things like that...<br>  and she needs 2 be slapped...lol|`|nKruEEuhaa	First off, why is your boyfriend talking to her? Was he friends with her before you two got together? He can't expect you to cut complete contact with her if HE is still talking to her. <br>  <br>  Obviously you two stopped being friends for a reason, now is that reason something that is actually worth giving up your friendship? Sometimes its best to just go separate ways, but if that's what you want, then you need to make it clear to your boyfriend that you don't want anything to do with her, which means that either he needs to stop talking to her- because obviously he's telling you what she's saying, or if you don't care that they are friends, he needs to stop relaying everything she is saying to him. <br>  <br>  Now a question to think about is .. when this ex-friend of yours is talking crap to your boyfriend about you, what is he saying? If she just talks to him to complain about you, why is he answering her calls? When your with someone who you care about, you don't want to sit and listen to someone complain about them.
dJoE8yedaa	I definitely do.|`|SLeX0gGaaa	As long as it isn't some old creep. Or someone nerdy or whatever.
Z7re3Geqaa	A little bit of both. If she is loud/talkative chances are she likes to flirt. I would not want someone who is with me and still would flirt with other guys. That is disrespectful. If she is quiet, chances are she is calm cool. I like that. However, when the time is needed, I would not want her to stay quiet either. A strong independent girl is ideal. Her love would be dependent on me though.|`|ba710b487ccfa1c08bca99dcd3575df5aa	yeaaaa.<br>  i'd like to know!

You said it best, there are plenty of fish in the sea, and you only knew her for one week. The reason she hooked up with you is because she is still single and going through the **** phase. Move on dude.|`|mndpyoV1aa	I think you should give up because sober or not she cheated on her boyfriend she has now so if you were to get together with her you really think she will be faithful to you to? I will tell you she wont be. she hooked up with you cause you were there, she thought you were hot, and she knows that her boyrfriend will NEVER find out about it. You want a girl if faithful. and what kind of girl do you think she is if she is hooking up with on a cruise ship after only knowing you for a week for all she knew you could have aids and thats goes for you to. she could have all kinds of diseases and you could have gotten them condom or not. you were a fling. forget about her move on.|`|XKn14Qpjaa	She wants you to leave her alone, and thats her right.

Basically, after that, you have given him 2 roads to go down. Road A: He see's what he's gonna' throw away, and tries all he can to stop that from happening. Road B: He sees this as a rope ladder out of this relationship. He agrees with you and leaves you.<br>  <br>  At any rate, this was a good thing. I wish you all the best, Unknown Identity.

dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	YES.  It is necessary.  If you dont love yourself, I suppose you've experienced some kind of neglect through your childhood.  Im sorry for that, really.  <br>  <br>  Do you know that there is a 'condition' on which some babies are listed, they call it 'ftt'  It means, 'failure to thrive'.  A certain type of personality that needs love and nurturing and hasnt felt it in the womb and upon entering the world and their body begins to shut down and die.  These babies are inconsolable because the one person that they needed to love them into the world didnt do that.<br>  <br>  When a couple lives and loves together and their partner dies, they soon die too.  When a parent loses a child, the parent doesnt want to live anymore even though they may have other children or there are other people in their life.  <br>  <br>  We find a reason to live and love.  If we lose that reason aka 'love' for something or someone, we simply become a shell and the soul and heart we once had seems to leave our own body.  <br>  It's as if our body is all that remains and only the thinking part of us remains and tries to survive.  Every cell of our body works to keep the body alive, but without the heart and soul to continue the 'spark' of life, the 'electricity' needed to sustain us...we lose the battle to continue to exist.  we fail to thrive.  we find no purpose to life.  as you have described.  you find no joy.  <br>  <br>  I hope that you can, if not love yourself, to find someone or someones to love and care about and let their happiness from your love, fill your heart!  take care dear.  someone loves you.<br>  even if you dont know them, someone is loving you and waiting for you.  peace|`|l9yvP0fxaa	wow I love everything you said.<br>  I have problems being close to people also and I don't think love is the key to a happy life. To some, companionship is life, some believe is our reason for being here, but that doesn't have to reflect your own thought process. If your happy just being yourself and occupying your own time then all the more power to you, your the independent, no strings attached girl and nothings wrong with that.|`|z3jRrrvnaa	Heya<br>  <br>  I started out reading your question thinking, "No way girl, love doesn't equal happiness," but as I finished reading I changed my mind. <br>  <br>  I do agree with you about people putting too much emphasis on love and relationships. Sometimes it seems every song off the radio is about love, everyone is talking about their crushes, boyfriends, girlfriends, blah...life is about so much more.<br>  <br>  Love shouldn't be your reason to live, but heck yeah, it makes you happy. It's great to have someone's shoulder to rest your head on at the end of the day...and it's great to have someone who understands you. <br>  <br>  If the opportunity comes along, if the right guy comes along, take it. If you're happy as you are, don't. Though...why don't you set a goal to loving yourself properly first? Talk to lots of people, to satisfy your own curiosity if nothing else...don't see it as you bothering them, most people will love talking about themselves. As horrible as that sounds.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

And he writes you long e mails back.<br>   I dont know why he dont talk about himself,,, why don't you ask him questions: like ~~ what is your new school like (if you all are in school)<br>  or ask him how he likes his new home, and has he made any friends yet? <br>   It would not hurt to ask him these questions(or something like them)<br>  to see if he begins to open up to you about himself.<br>  <br>  Since he didn't mention this other guy,,,,, he probally dont want to hear about another guy liking you.

d7f2c01962fe4f1fd4ed854d458d9f91aa	'Loving her'  -  You feel such intense feelings for your loved one that you feel you cannot live without her; you recognise and accept her for who and what she is, warts and all. 'Loving the idea of her' - You have intense feelings for her and believe you love her, but you haven't recognised the 'true' person.  Rather, you have idealised her and atributed her with virtues that you perceive as perfect - a person of your own imagination - as you want her to be - your idea. The time will come, however, when you will wake-up to this fact and realise how you have duped yourself - the person you thought you loved was not really that person at all!|`|AA11447210	loving her = loving the person she is, as she is<br>  <br>  loving the idea of her = loving who you wish she was|`|AA10020034	To me it's kind of like the difference between the individual and any number of others, or the difference between the particulars and the ballpark, or the difference between reality and fantasy.<br>  <br>  All in one.<br>  <br>  If you truly love a person, you accept that person for who they are. You embrace the things that make up who they are. You don't have to enjoy everything about the person, but you realize that all their characteristics including their flaws, is their reality right now and part of the deal with being involved with them.<br>  <br>  If you love the idea of her, you may appreciate the thing she represents, and as such, she is technically replaceable. The idea of a wife, or a lover, or a mother, or a girlfriend, or a partner, all these kind of imply that it is a generalized role that meets a need for you. OR maybe you had the idea and it was sweet but really doesn't match what you ended up with, or ended up having to deal with.|`|IgEYfBPJaa	loving her = you love her as a person,<br>  loving the idea of her = probably doesnt matter who she is, you just like the idea of having a girlfriend<br>  <br>  i think :/|`|JQjs3cB3aa	you love the idea of being her girlfriend and being able to say that smy gf but when it comes down to it you don't actually love her and her personality etc.|`|ZRgkgJeDaa	you always love what you haven't got.loving her for who she is or loving the idea of what you think it might be like|`|LrL4JiwJaa	If you love someone - truely love someone, you know your entire world would fall apart without them.<br>  You wake up and immediately think about them.<br>  They are on your mind ALL the time and you can see them in your future without it scaring you.<br>  You would do anything for them.<br>  <br>  Loving the idea of someone is infatuation.<br>  You love being in a relationship.

vXA9dxjnaa	Hi Jess<br>  <br>  If you've only had one relationship and he let you down then I really would not be down about it and not sure why you say you've had such problems with men. For every idiot there is a good one out there and its just a case of finding him. <br>  <br>  Would I approach you? maybe, maybe not. That depends on how you came across and I can't judge that from a pic. You do look good, but its not just about looks. You do sound cool though and quite down to earth and that's attractive in itself. Well I think so. <br>  <br>  Don't be downhearted. You have no reason to be. <br>  <br>  :)|`|F63yZgkRaa	Hi  im 37 now and believe me you got your whole life ahead of you at the age of 17 so why worry about men now!! you have been in one relationship and it wasnt good,theres many men out ther who are like that and theres many women too!Just relax,have fun and the right one will come along whatever you are like.If yoiu was voted a nice person then you must be nice.Your pretty so date loads of men before you start worrying about them lol|`|7p3TCz3qaa	You're still a teenager,you have your whole life ahead of you.You'll kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince,so enjoy the experiences you have along the way!|`|0s3QjkuBaa	i think ur cute. get out more. or talk to me. haha|`|aY6EjDwjaa	i think i can honestly say that i'd think WOAH who's the supermodel !?<br>  and judging by what you say about your personality your a blast!<br>  i think i can honestly say you may just pick the wrong guy(s) <br>  or you dont pick enough<br>  in the way that your not asking people out|`|MVqiulXcaa	Fishing for compliments isnt getting you anywhere, hun.<br>  <br>  Quit begging people on yahoo answers to call you pretty and make you feel better about your sorry life.<br>  I bet that isnt even you.<br>  Anyways.<br>  <br>  Get a life. -_-|`|La4EHNo7aa	i would. lol<br>  <br>  AK

I think if you have enough going on in your life otherwise it's easier to not think about, but deep down obviously everyone is always thinking about someone. <br>  They are prob just waiting for someone to approach them and don't think they should have to make the effort. <br>  It's funny they both sound like me, haha.
1KajpBdaaa	aww lol feeding him half a mini powdered donut thats CUUUUUUTTTEEE ^-^ but i think hes kinda ashamed to say that hes dating long distance...i know i would be...sorry im not much help...its just that its 1:00 AM right now and im kinda tired (>'-')>|`|B7idbFNVaa	IGNORE you in what WAY.  Like he is DISTANCE from you.  OR doesn't hold hand or KISS you in front of OTHERS?<br>  <br>  Maybe, he is not comfortable around your friends YET.<br>  <br>  I agree with YOU, he should put up information and HIM and YOU dating!!<br>  And also he should show picture to the WORLD that YOU'RE TOGETHER.
3qaXA0oBaa	you are coming undone about this guy who is not giving you even the basic requirements of being a boyfriend. of course he's not into you, of course he's doing other things...whether there's a girl involved doesn't even matter.  but it sounds like he is seeing someone else but isn't dumping you YET because he wants to see if it works out first. always good to keep something on the side just in case. in other words....lose the loser!!! he is not being cool to you and you don't feel secure in the relationship. stop obsessing and playing detective and leave. if you don't, you will be crying about this a few months from now, trust me. just stop calling him and don;t see him. you don't even need to explain, other than i need more form this relationship and you don't even want to spend the night with me. goodbye.|`|xSX9FRu2aa	hes getting bootey calls <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgE6gYW.el06dA0AXi_1MSPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221173827AAScZDx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	yea its kinda strange|`|WrT6UnvNaa	talk to him about it if you over analyze you will go insane and possibly there is nothing going on and you have trust issues. if there is though it is best to figure it out as soon as possible as in right now.|`|AA10913583	sound very suspicious, you should really try to get to the bottom of this coz it seems like he is seeing someone other than you.|`|49f6cbd2686a9cc3b76dbadb4c520e99aa	well i think it sounds a little weird on why he has to walkout and talk the calls why can't he do it right there in front of you? And no i don't think your paranoid i just think your being smart and making sure your not looking stupid, because you don't want to stand there and get played. I think you should talk to him about it, or try things to see if he is messing around. Like one day forget your phone or say you forgot it so you need his phone to call someone and while it look threw his phone and see who he has been calling and if he tells you to wait before he gives you the phone you know hes probably deleting some numbers. I wish you the best and know that there is a guy out there that will be good for you, you just have to wait for him or maybe you may already know him.|`|6W4hhZliaa	Suspicious yes, don't jump to conclusions though. Try to find out whats going on without him knowing, and without being sneaky, and don't tell him what you think, it might anger him and make him leave, then what if you were wrong? you'd be losing a good man.<br>  All the best anyway x|`|Au7GEfQiaa	Your not being paranoid. Seriously something is up. Do what every girl has the right to do when put in that situation. Stalk his ***. You need to creep on him like its your job. Be a detective, because something is funky|`|XGgPhaDbaa	This man is playing you like a fiddle.<br>  <br>  Just break it off now. Don't give him any reason, he doesn't deserve it.<br>  He will probably not even push the issue as he already has a backup.<br>  He is dating someone else and will dump you soon if you don't do it 1st.<br>  Block his calls and e-mails and refuse to see him. It makes getting over them easier.|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	How long have you been dating him? If your gut is telling you that something is wrong, trust your gut.  Because it's always right.  If you are use to hanging out with him until 2am and he is looking to drop you off out of no where, then something might be up.  But staying out late can always catch up to the person too.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	talk to him about it , confront him what you know . and get it all out in to the open.|`|4d7f164df9b799e88fffba204ae0183faa	Maybe he is losing interest.  Sorry. :(  It seems like you should just talk to him and find out what's going on and hopefully he'll be honest with you.|`|V6Fxf3Dbaa	Well next time you go down om him see if his penis tastes like another girl.|`|AA10188961	I find the whole thing suspicious.  I don't think your paranoid.  Something is usually up when the guys routines change. You need to confront him, or it will never be resolved.|`|TuIrAXLkaa	definitely doing something. don't sit around and get played. you should go out on a date with a so called friend too and when he asks tell him what he told you it was a friend|`|lXpGlAm3aa	When I read it from the beginning,I want to think maybe he was tired from the stress of selling a house.But some of the clues sound strange.Also that you don't have a car is an advantage to him.<br>  <br>  Can you try to ask him if he is cheating on you?Be firmly direct.Just ask in a calm voice.And just explain,that it would be better to be up front with you.Why drag someone through that?Just explain that if he is seeing someone else, let you know so you can move on as well.I think Men like directness.just get to the point,hun.Don't sugarcoat it ,just ask him!!!! Tell him that you would have the decency to let him know if you met another guy.And if you liked that other guy ;better than him.At least that is being honest,and not a sneak.<br>  <br>  But then again maybe he isn't doing anything?It's so hard to say.But it almost sounds like something is up his sleeve and it's not his elbow.<br>  <br>  Well,you also mentioned he has a son.Does he have full custody or part?Kids can drain your energy.They are alot of responsibilities.And very active and so forth.You may have a child yourself?<br>  <br>  Please talk to him about your relationship.If he doesn't want to talk,then you know he is hiding something from you.Without communication there is nothing.And you might as well let him go.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you out.Good Luk!|`|pSicXtlVaa	I think that you shouldnt let it go right away, but dont be too worried<br>  A little suspicious, but like you said, maybe its just that hes older|`|ubbKS6BBaa	I find it shady. You need a car, that way you can stay over with him. And you can say "I can drive home when you leave" <br>  <br>  I hate hearing stuff like that, you just never know. I would ask him face to face. And if he doesn't make eye contact or looks around while speaking to you. I wouldn't trust it.
1CRbzkABaa	The tough thing is of course he still loves you and cares about you. And it may frustrate you because your wondering why he is not with you then or doesn't tell you. Right now he is very mad because he is in the grieving process after a long relationship ends it is going to hurt both people no matter who ends it. Despite what people think guys need to feel loved and it is driving him crazy right now. For starters no one can really tell you how he feels right now. But if you want him back and your willing to try to fight for him there is a few steps you need to take to ensure that you get your best shot without scaring him away. I am very good at advising people, on my college campus I help teach guys how to learn to approach girls and what to do for the first few steps. I have a very high success rate, and I am willing to help anybody who needs. I currently don't know what communication you have had with you ex or what tactics you have done if any to tell him your feelings. The biggest issue with guys is not that we don't have feelings but we usually don't know how to interpret those feelings. And if he was ready to fight someone over you then there is definitely still hope. I would like to know what he said when you explained to him the situation about what happened between you and his friend. But the first bit of advice i can give. If you interested on trying to get him back, don't overwhelm him but let him know that you are thinking about him. Send him a text message at a time anywhere between 2am-4am just saying that you happened to be awake feeling sad and that you where thinking about him (if you can mention a good moment you had together and say you where thinking about that) and that you miss him. End the text with I miss you dont make it a really long text but short and too the point will be effective. If he is feeling sad guys like nothing more then to wake up in the morning and to see a text. It means someone was thinking about them and that will put a smile on his face. Dont follow up on the text message dont ask if he got it or what he thinks. Just send it and forget about it. If you decide to take my advice I can help you through this situation. I wish you the best of luck.

k7Pd7Glqaa	You have every right to be jealous.  He is not trying to "mess with her mind" by texting dirty messages to her... He is messing with your mind!<br>  It sounds like he wants to play both of you.  They will always have a connection since they have a child together, and you are going to drive yourself crazy worrying about them.<br>  Tell him how you feel about their long conversations, and text's. If he don't stop, then he dont care about you as much as you deserve!<br>  Sorry to sound mean, but he is not going to stop w/his ex.  I have been there, done that, and wrote a book on it!|`|euOtDB3Baa	I know how jealousy feels.  I've got this guy right now who my parents love even more than they love me.  It's tough being the one who is cast out of a circle so close, but you're not being a *****.  Try to make him realize that that life is gone, and he needs to focus on the one he is a part of now...yours.  If  he is so concerned about messing with her mind, then he still cares waaaay to much about what is going on in her life, when he should be caring that much about yours.  But I'm also afraid to lose someone really great right now...so follow your instincts when it comes to him, but don't let this woman rule how your relationship is working out.  Maybe moving somewhere new is the answer?  Go somewhere you can start over together without her always butting in all the time.  Oh, wait...you guys are just dating.  Sorry.  Idk...but good luck with it girl.|`|SpalD7Tsaa	Ask him to be honest with you and don't so anything you feel that you wouldn't do|`|2VCJ07XHaa	beeny the dirty texting bit...ur probably worth more...get out now, while u can|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Yowsa, I think you have more than enough reason to be jealous.<br>  <br>  Your bf should NOT be sending dirty texts to anyone but YOU!<br>  <br>  He obviously is not over his ex wife if he is in contact with her THAT much, and I wouldn't want to resemble her in any way shape or form either (in regards to the tattoo thing).<br>  <br>  You need to have a talk with this boy and get his priorities straight...<br>  <br>  If he can't devote his full attention to you and his daughter, then you need a guy with less baggage!|`|clnFe3aCaa	if he is spending more time with the phone(his ex) than with you than i think that you should talk to him about it and if he still does not listen then its probably time to take a break(dump him or go somewhere else until you decide what to do) and you should go and have a tattoo if you want one. just becoz she has one doesn't mean that you can't have one too. what if you're mom has a tattoo and you want one will you just not do it becoz you don't want to be like you're mother?<br>  from my opinion i think you should have a tattoo and talk about you're problems with you're boyfriend|`|03ccdec50586f6903629b58b15507712aa	Do you really think he was just trying to "mess with her mind"?

7ziT7Ob5aa	well for me, i want a girld who's fun, nice, loving, sexy, someone i can have a conversation with, and supports me in whatever i want to do.
EUVr6uNVaa	1) In a girlfriend. Good looks are a bonus however if I like her personally you tend to see her as pretty and attractive anyway. Personality wise, someone who has a good sense of humor and makes me laugh, sweet, intelligent, strong minded and determined but cute<br>  <br>  2) Its irrelevant to me. What is relevant is the love and support she would give me, not the money. Of course she would have to pull her weight as well and earn some dosh but isn't a big deal to me

But you need to prove yourself if he lost trust. It is not something he can give back in one phone conversation. You two have known each other for 2 years so when you did something that took away his trust it put you guys back. I would say apologize to him and tell him you will try to prove yourself again.

1w3zBbqxaa	It sounds like she is interested in you but wants to be alone for a bit. Coming out of a long term relationship can be hard and most people are able to jump into another one right away. Right now she might be at the testing stage. But a word of warning the testing stage can easily move into a friendship area instead of a romantic area. Id bring up the conversation again. Ask her up front about which one she decided. Dont be too aggressive when asking though, try to sound playful and flirtatious. Her answer will tell you if she likes you. You can also tell her that you really like her, but that you realize that she just got out of a relationship. Tell her that you'd like the chance to get to know her and that you'd like to see how it progresses. That way there is no pressure to jump into a new relationship right away but you are still letting her know that you are attracted to her and would like to be more than her friend........ eventually.|`|mNYKoQg2aa	I agree with the person above.

Eventually she is going to realise he is not serious about her and dump him, or he is going to get fed up being in a relationship he doesn't really want to be in. <br>  <br>  If you can wait, maybe it would be a good idea to talk to him after him and his gf have split. That way, you won't be getting between them, and won't accidently hurt anyone, especially not his gf. At the moment, she may not see that he doesn't love her, and would be hurt if he chose to be with you instead.<br>  <br>  If it is unlikely that they will split up anytime soon then maybe it would be good just to have an honest conversation with him about how you feel. Not online though, because you want to see his reaction. It may be awkward, but trust me, you don't want to be in a situation where you don't know if he means what he is saying to you or not.<br>  <br>  Even if this means that they split up because of it, it is already unfair on his girlfriend that he is carrying on with a relationship he does not feel strongly about.<br>  <br>  You sound realy nice, and if you think he is interested in you then you are probably right.

gJE0ujbzaa	They "have" to date "unsuitable" girls?<br>  <br>  Why do they "have" to?  What makes the girls "unsuitable"?

LGCTOxZxaa	He told you that cause he prolly knew you wouldnt do it if you knew it was illegal. And dont sweat it, 3 years is no big deal. If he was hot, id say its worth it.
Ig0nRZlgaa	Well, aside from all that was listed, I get more of an idea of YOUR emotions. Which you are obviously exhausted, hopeful, displaying mixed emotions, confused and fearful.<br>  <br>  These are sure signs of someone trying to make something happen rather than accept disappointment.<br>  <br>  If you are exhausted it's because you are pushing the relationship to be. The mixed emotions are in you "knowing better"..the fear is in "does he mean what he says--maybe not. And the hope is in the history you share and your desires to make it work.<br>  <br>  Correct me if Iam wrong.<br>  <br>  Now, HIM......You said...<br>  <br>  ...he said it and he still doesn’t show it. <br>  <br>  Because he is not sure and any pressure will send him running.<br>  <br>  You said that HE said...<br>  ....think he may not want to ruin the friendship by getting into a relationship. <br>  <br>  This is FEAR on his part, because he maybe comfortable with the relationship the way it is and his fear is in hurting you.<br>  <br>  You said...<br>  ...I have tried many times to talk to him. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you cannot reach him this way, then he is not ready.<br>  <br>  He said...<br>  he said it and he still doesn’t show it. <br>  <br>  If you don't feel it, then your gut is probably right.<br>  He may have been saying it because he knows this is what you want to hear.<br>  <br>  <br>  Based on my experience, this man loves you, but not in the way you would like. He cares for and respects you and doesn't want to lose your friendship. So all the talking in the world won't matter.<br>  <br>  Do not push for this. You have to either ACCEPT what you have and continue to be a friend and do not get your hopes up, or if it hurts too much for you to remain friends--as sad as it is, if you cannot accept it for what it is, then you will have to set yourself free by terminating the friendship.<br>  <br>  My guess it,...you already know hon. No sense in pretending anymore---hold your head high, accept it for what it is and make a choice to let go of the torment OR you can continue to feed it. <br>  <br>  The right decision is never the easiest.

But don't keep asking him or pushing him to answer.|`|yvdxzQDsaa	he will like u|`|ItmekGwsaa	He's not really all that interested his mind is definitely some where else because when a girl likes you, you either say I like you too = he likes you or thats cool = I dont care or dont like you. However it ends up I hope the best.|`|hYHRoyvDaa	I would take it as trying to let you down easy. If he really liked you he would of said that. He sounds like he is trying to be nice. don't worry there are hundreds of more guys out there!
wp5d4LmEaa	no unless he is gay.|`|x68KtQUcaa	perhaps...|`|O2s8tLQzaa	Do you prefer "soft" one?|`|QmpQ3qoNaa	...........|`|okg1aa4Uaa	it depends on a lot of things
ibFTUi1taa	You say that the relationship is complicated and that you can't fully commit and he has issues of his own. I think that's the problem.<br>  You both don't seem to know what you want and you both seem unsure of yourselfs. You two should take a break from each other (and avoid other romantic relations) to find out what you want. <br>  Now for what I make of what he said to you; he is not sure what he wants and is confused as to what he should say. I have the feeling that he cares about you, but may be uncomfortable about this relationship you two have. <br>  I think a break is in order. Make sure that if you do take a break that you explain that it's not because you don't care aout him, but it's to figure out what you want exactly in a relationship and that he should think about the same thing. <br>  Best of luck. =)
fHRe4YfEaa	Just invite her to go see a movie or something. Then, afterward go have lunch somewhere and hold her hand or something. You don't have to just ask her out you can do it more subtly :)|`|IpQyQRXvaa	HEY ***** YOU LOOKIN PRETTY SEXY IN DAT TOP.. TAKE IT OFF ***** mmmm GIMME SOME OF THAT|`|x0R1UKhWaa	write her a note, tell her that you like her and you've kind of noticed that she likes you too, but you wanted to be sure. ask her if she wants to go out iwth you. or if she has a cell phone then you could text her.
Jd7SnU4Vaa	aw she's pretty and you're a cute kid....perfect match ;-)|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Nonsense. It's all about your self confidence. If your confident questions like this don't even come to mind. So no she's not to hot for you unless you think she is.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	nahh,<br>  treat her right though :]<br>  by the way..your girlfriend probably doesn't want you plastering pictures of her all over the internet ;] hehe.|`|v2gyKb9Zaa	no, you guys look good together.|`|VHv67wR8aa	awww no dont say that you guys are a super cute couple=]|`|b9fd917c446e0d2b1c604b0ed7e053c6aa	aww no you both have good looks :)|`|XeRmN8L7aa	i am so hotter than your girlfriend she is so ugly but if u need a hotter gf|`|ubbKS6BBaa	No. you both look young but she's prettier.

50yx063Daa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Inviting her out to coffee is a great idea, but I strongly suggest that you don't tell her ahead of time "I've got to ask you something." It's just too weird and it will only make her nervous. You want to be able to relax and have a good time. So take her out for coffee...chat her up (catch up) and then near at the end of your coffee date, ask if she would like to go out to dinner with you sometime because you had a great time with her. <br>  If you do it that way, you won't come off as being desperate or as if you were working up the courage to ask her. Best of luck!|`|ulZv4LDBaa	just ask her and say do u plan on having a  boy frind then if she says yes ask her out
96ZfDF6Aaa	There's a bunch of factors to consider here.  I'd want to know why he hasn't told his parents he has a girlfriend.  Also, if one of the parents is facing serious illness, he may be overwhelmed by the situation and not feeling up to long conversations due to stress levels at his parents house.<br>  <br>  He's emailing you but you didn't give any content information.  If he's telling you how much he misses you in the e-mails then he's trying to meet your needs and the needs he has in the current situation.<br>  <br>  I think he's under a lot of stress and needs your support and understanding.  Since you have the ability to e-mail him tell him how much you care and that you hope he's ok.  Ask him if there's anyway you can help or be more supportive even though its long distance.<br>  <br>  He's only going to be gone 10 days so you'll know for sure if something has changed when he gets back.  For now I would assume he still has the same feelings he had when he left.|`|aDChHZ1yaa	this means that hes gone gay and is cheating on you with not only 1 man but multiple men i mean think about it you guys talked for only 15 minutes hes obviously in a rush to do something big right?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NO DICE|`|e0Y49L2jaa	i think he is saying the truth, he is busy wth fam prblms and health issues, jst give him time and space, and make up for the lost time whn he comes back, relax :)
W6LGsQC8aa	If he is willing to break your heart when you had plans to marry in the Fall... then he is a loser and not worth your time.<br>  <br>  You are obviously going to hurt for a while, and that's natural, but trust me, you don't want him back!<br>  <br>  Exes are exes for a reason!|`|TRrTunqvaa	well i know it may sound tough, but if its not meant to be then you have to accept that.  if he really cares, he will come back. to get my boyfriend back, i just didnt call (like he asked) and a few days later hes like "omg you never not call" and he wanted me because he couldnt have me.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	chain him up to your bed................|`|qPmQvqJXaa	Just let him know that you care, and that you want him back.  Then, just let go.  You can't force him to come back to you.  Neither you nor he will benefit from your refusal to accept his choice.  However, if you aren't clingy, whiny, threatening, etc., he may realize he made a mistake and come back on his own.  JUST DON'T PLAY GAMES!  That will only prolong your suffering, and set you up for the same thing later when he realizes you tricked him.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	wow. this is hard? why did he brake up with you in the first place?|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	remind him of beautiful moments you had together. <br>  thaat always wins my heart back|`|z3QsWmzpaa	omg im so sorry <br>  why did you break up ?? and can it be fixed ??<br>  you should talk to him|`|U0pwzNYqaa	Tell him your true feelings. it might sound foolish but call him if he don't answer leave lots of voice mails if you have to cry then do it. Express 100% how you feel. Then he will realize that you miss him and he misses you. The things that yall loved doing together mention it say you miss it me and my boyfriend went threw this i was extremely sad couldn't eat always was wondering what he was doing. so i finally broke the ice i couldn't take it any longer and the same way i was missing him he was missing me. now we are back together strong as ever.|`|6uzhVE0aaa	you know that really sucks<br>  and i feel sorry for you <br>  but you also need to respect the fact that he does not want to be with you. <br>  just keep him as a friend for now <br>  maybe something will come back|`|D1KT9ioJaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCrNRzSEvnY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCrNRzSEv...</a><br>  step by step instruction|`|uu6ivaYUaa	Let go.

If I were you I would forget about him and go meet other guys.|`|ynBjE9YVaa	It depends on why he brook up with you.|`|XeLZtw20aa	try to forget him and meet other guys and get your close friends to comfort you|`|RRnK3BuYaa	i am so sorry for your breakup.<br>  in my opinion you have 2 options<br>  <br>  Option 1<br>  Try talking 2 him again. Spill your heart out to him and remind him of those beautiful 4 years of love you shared together. ASk him, " Why should we throw away four years?" <br>  <br>  Option 2<br>  move on. everything happens for a reason. Maybe its for the better.<br>  <br>  <br>  i know its easier said then done. But think hard on this.. is he worth it? He hurt you... and if you move on... i know he will come back. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|9WKVmOs1aa	if you guys planned on marrying and then he broke up with you, then he obviously can't handle you for the rest of his life. you can try again though and talk to him about all of this when you are together. try doing something to show him how u feel that no one has ever done before. take him somewhere that is really special to the both of you or do something for him that he would never think you would do. be spontaneous! if it doesnt work then he obviously isnt even worth it. there are plenty of guys out there i promise!|`|IwFS27eRaa	He's your ex-boyfriend, not your boyfriend. If you've dated him for four years then he knows all your tricks. What things did you do wrong? Maybe fix them, or a lot, a lot, a lot of times men/women just need time to miss the other one. I broke up with my girlfriend after dating for nearly two years, we stayed apart for three months. I dated another girl in those three months and found out quickly that I loved my old girlfriend. Guys are programmed to always be looking for something better, he probably just got that same guy fever I did.|`|sI5SakRvaa	Make im regret that he lost you . dont do silly things dont wright to him dont call him. make him miss you. <br>  <br>  remember plane hard to get make em want you even more.<br>  <br>  but also remember there are alots of guys.<br>  <br>  and no matter how a wwomen looks if shes confident shes sexy :D|`|uTYXxzqmaa	Talk to eachother and try to understand eachothers feelings|`|7yW3UUN4aa	You were together for four years and had plans to marry this fall so there are all chances of him coming back. Try to contact him from your known sources. The true lovers never fail.|`|wg62bghYaa	oh wow thats really intensee im so sorry<br>  but why did u guys break up<br>  if u can fix that problem<br>  then u should get him back<br>  but it really depends why u guys broke up in teh first place|`|bdviHPklaa	he probaly needs time...give him time thn start becomin hes close friend again thn let evferyting fall in its place|`|jqsu76T5aa	make him jealous<br>  <br>  <br>  im in the same situation.|`|b53k0EZkaa	make him jealous...even though thats the wrong thing to do but still be a badd ***! hah|`|lmln877qaa	Have a 3-some with him and another girl!|`|gMKrx3vxaa	Kiss him that is all i can say holler|`|ahDBFy8Haa	**** him. make him bust a nut|`|iBi1GuDKaa	GET ON YOUR KNEES AND SHOW HIM HOW MUCH U WANT HIM BACK.

1mHcXNImaa	Well hun, honestly there isn't any "big" sign that he's going after you. But if you're feeling the eye contact and butterflies, you need to take initiative and make the first move. However, you know him more than I do. If he is the type to try and get girls to have sex with him, than usually that's all those types of guys want. I think that you should talk to him and if you guys like each other and decide to hang out, that's when you'll know. When you're alone with him, you'll be able to tell if he's just trying to have sex or if he actually likes you.

A woman teaching women about man is like a man teaching a man about women.<br>  <br>  Here are your answers:<br>  <br>  1. If you like a guy, and see no reason otherwise, trust him off the bat. Stop being insecure and trust in your man until he gives you a reason otherwise.<br>  2. We are into you if we try to get your attention or just talk to you out of the blue when we could talk to anyone else, but we choose you. Or, we might act strange around you.<br>  3. If you cross the line, we will probably tell you (at least I would). Us dudes verbalize our problems. We are, obviously, not like women who try to read into things. WE WILL TELL YOU!<br>  4. If he is hanging out with you, then he most likely enjoys spending time with you. Let's face it; he could be doing anyhting else at that moment right?<br>  5. Guys like semi-aggressive girls.

[but i did anyways cause i'll always love him] but if you don't wanna be without the person, then just wait. if it keeps getting better...then it's love. i guess you kinda just know. but as you stay with the person, the feeling will grow and you'll get more and more confident that you love him.|`|7HzuqXP3aa	Love is complicated—GET USED TO IT.|`|jhGZNVYpaa	You know when you don't have to ask on Yahoo!

I mean you have to be attracted to him AND like his personality and that's not being superficial, it's the truth.

ss5vAWKSaa	Compliments are good conversation starters.  Compliment his guitar-playing or his eyes or whatever.  Asking questions are good too.  Like, how did he get there today, did he drive?  Does he have sisters & brothers?  Get him to talk about himself a little.  If you get things started with a conversation, it's up to him to help you along a little.  Don't feel that you have to do it all.  You sound like you really like him.

3O1EcmrGaa	Get used to it, rejection is a part of life and everyone,  yes EVERYONE has experienced it whether they realize it or not.  Even if someone has never been rejected verbally, they have looked at someone they were attracted to hoping the other person would notice them and it didn't happen.

If you like him and you think he likes you, you should ask him to go with you, because the opportunity might pass up and you will be thinking "What if..." .<br>  Go with your friends as well and tell him how you feel about wanting to go with him and not wanting to dance. Guys may seem macho sometimes, but they still like knowing what you are thinking. Maybe he feels the same way. He might feel uncomfortable dancing in front of you too. If you do end up dancing together, don't worry about it. Have fun with it and if you mess up, don't take it too seriously. Laugh it off and he will think that you are funny and not really boring (guys like being entertained as well as being the entertainer, so try not to get  really mad with yourself if you make a mistake).<br>  Also, tell him that you want to be able to hang out with your friends as well. Maybe you can all hang out for a while and dance with your friends for a song, but make sure that he never feels too left out (Guys hate that, they always want to be a part or it)<br>  I hope I helped you without being too confusing.

8FbOtXAXaa	Well I think that since you still really like boy A and he is coming home and you can't wait to see him it shows that you are still really into him and don't want to let him go quite yet. I think that you need to find out what is going on with boy A first and see if he is serious about you or not. If he isn't then obviously you would have to move on but I don't think that you should go out with boy B just to move on. That would not be fair to him if you were not really into him and you still had feelings for boy A. You would be using him just to keep your mind off of boy A and that would just end up hurting boy B. No need to have more hurt feelings. I think you should just tell boy B that you still have feelings for boy A and that you can't go out with him because of the feelings you still have for boy A. Boy B wants you to be either all for him or not and you are not all for him because you have feelings for another guy so just let him down gently and let him know how you feel and move on.|`|AA10593575	It looks to me that your kinda treating Boy B like Boy A is treating you. All I'm gonna say is that don't lead Boy B on he obviously can't have all of you so he'll have to have nothing. Tell him to give you some space and when Boy A comes back tell him you want all of him or nothing. If Boy A wants to take things further tell Boy B that you have feelings for someone else. If Boy A doesn't want to take things further, depending on how this will affect you will effect if you want to go out with Boy B.|`|OpRWTPvfaa	So, boy B told you he wants all or nothing but you still have feelings for boy A - more than you do for B. The best advice I can give is that if you want anything at all with boy A, find some way to contact him (even if its by the oh-so-slow US postal system instead of by phone or internet) and figure out (either by yourself or with him) if you two want anything to do with each other.<br>  <br>  Once you've decided that, once you know where you stand with boy A (in a relationship or not/trying for something more, or not) then you know whether you can give boy B your all. If it's not your all, I don't suggest going out with B. It's not fair to him or you, because you'll doubt it in the back of your mind for as long as you're together.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Wait a bit for Boy A sounds like something could be there. And using Boy B to get over A is wrong.|`|bYvGNvrvaa	It is definitely not fair to boy B because you still have feelings for boy A, it is never right to use someone as a rebound, tell boy B the situation and be like "when i'm over boy A then we can date but for now i feel like its not fair to you, because i wont be able to give all of me to you when most of my heart belongs to boy A"|`|k7tavXzbaa	it sounds like boy a either didn't want to lead you on or didn't really "like" you.  that and maybe the fact your a freshman might have lead him to believe you might get too attached and he still wants some freedom<br>  boy b if it would have been an automatic yes then you would have been so excited you would forget boy a.  so tell boy b you wanna hang out and just do some stuff as friends will boy a is gone and then see how you feel<br>  <br>  i hope this helps|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	if you like boy A better than boy B, if youre really sure then wait for boy A to come back but make sure you ask him if he likes you the way you like him!!! if he doesnt like you that way then its useless  now all you got to do is move on with boy B i guess!!!

Regardless of how shy you are, you got to let him know what you like and what you want. I would expect him to do the same for you and if he isn't, that is a problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Problems like these will not resolve until you say something. It is not weird or demanding, to do so. However, don't be demanding and an asshole about it. Encourage him and make him feel good about doing what YOU like. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that and you will enjoy your sex life more!|`|z3jRrrvnaa	Hmm, okay :D let's see.<br>  <br>  You could...<br>  <br>  Tell him how neat it would be if you came together at the same time, and try and work on that together, as a kind of challenge.

That way he'll know the difference.|`|h1X49bP6aa	Try this, take a little more of the control. Try pleasing yourself with his unit, before you even have sex.

sSsTad98aa	This situation is not a difficult one...I'll explain...You have a heart felt relationship with your first guy that's truly what you're feeling...this second guy is the infatuation. Never mix the two or get them twisted because they're not one of the same. Most people will in their lifetime mix infatuation with love or confuse the two...that's what you're doing!! Isuggest you make plans to be with the first guy because you heart is really with him but at the same time you should enjoy the companionship and infatuation of your second guy because at this time he has become a big part of your happiness and contentment which is very important for you to maimtain!! I say enjoy them both for the parts they play in your life but in the end FOLLOW YOUR HEART!!|`|nabEAdD4aa	why did you get back with him?!<br>  its unfair if you're with him but dont feel the same, its just not fair on him so maybe you should end it with him and go after the one you do like?!<br>  because what if you keep on liking this guy during the time you choose to be with your current boyfriend?! its just not right|`|vshZJHaiaa	hey girl, don't hurt his feeling. don't be stupid. if you like that guy more that him then broke up with him. then everything's gonna be fine and fair.<br>  <br>  you tend to substitute boys.|`|WvBgXv5daa	Tell your boyfriend you need space, ask out the other guy if he says no, get back with your bf!|`|AA10447465	figure out witch one really makes you happy and decide before you loose both|`|iBi1GuDKaa	JUST GIVE THE NEW GUY SOME AND STAY W/ YA BF|`|PK5Elowdaa	Stick with the first guy. He seems to be working at a fast food joint but honestly not too many people can stay at a job like that. He seems like a hardworking guy who appreciates you. <br>  <br>  This new guy....I mean he's in college, thats a good thing I guess but thats all I know about him. A direction in life?? Maybe. But not everyone who goes to college becomes successful or better. It just means they're dedicated to achieving their goals. <br>  <br>  I say stay with your current boyfriend.|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Like a cop car.

When you or he are giving him a handjob, ask him to tell you when he is going to come. When he feels like he's close, slow riiiight down and almost but not quite stop. Then when the feeling has passed, continue, and repeat until he can't take it anymore. ;) when he finally does come, it will feel completely amazing.|`|dJoE8yedaa	This may sound really stupid, but put something distracting on TV, like football. Make him think of everything, but what you are doing to him. Eventually he can train his own mind to think of other things which would be better for you as you can get a chance to enjoy him.|`|vPzA4eqzaa	If you find out the answer can you tell me please i have the same problem you as to how to make my boyfriend last lol

He's stingy though so he doesn't buy me much hahahaha but I don't care.<br>  <br>  When he asked me out he told me all the things he loves about me and how much he loves me and how he wants us to grow old together and stuff like that. He cried every time I had to leave to go home when I lived 1,500 miles away but now we live together. <br>  <br>  AND he's a manly man too! He's not some lame little pussy boy. He's buff, loves playing those stupid macho video games, wants to own a gun, wants all boys, and tells his brothers they're pussy's and crap like that hahaha.

To me, it sounds quite serious, you should see a counsellor-I know that sounds embarassing, or maybe just try and distract yourself, or limit how many times you do it-once a day at night. And I think your horniness WILL go away and won't be as severe after you finish puberty, you're young now, you're growing up and it's just natural. I know how you feel cos it's happened to me a few times, I want to make it stop but I can't. Just remember when you are slightly older you'll have other things to worry about, you'll be too occupied to want to masturabte, and by the looks of it you'll get a nice girlfriend seeing as you're not shallow.|`|EoFmvY1Gaa	Wow, I know guys hormones are crazy around your age but its good to hear that you want to do something to control it.

Why do you think it's cheesy??|`|dJoE8yedaa	NO. It's the most romantic thing anyone could do, and hey, if it doesn't work out it's easier to end than divorce and less of an expense. After all, engagement is a trial run.|`|ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	not at all, I cannot think in anyone who seriously loves anyone else to think this is cheesy, aaaaaaaaahh i wish my boyfriend and me were engaged.|`|yyvcryrbaa	no it is the next step. that is why you think it is cheesy.|`|koynaDYbaa	Well, you have to dont you.

The kid is cute and you like him but you just wanna rip it's head off.  This is what happens when you ask a boyfriend/girlfriend the same type of things over and over.  It's just going to drive him further away which will make him seem more secretive and make you ask more questions.  Let it dry out for a bit and handle itself, and bring it up during relaxed down time when he's happy.  Sorry your going through this.|`|7yW3UUN4aa	It all depends upon the relations. If the relations are formal, there are chances of break up. Again if the relations are made with intention to gain something, the relations will dry out once the gain is made or achieved. Only those relations will survive which are made out of love and without any intentions to gain from relationship.|`|NBi2SoJzaa	i try to get closer to them,in due time they will trust u, is there things u dont tell ur partner??|`|YTgQ8HsSaa	Well, if you don't believe them in the end because of your own imagination, then it's really not their fault and those are problems that you have to deal with on your own.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I don't think you can ever really know everything in a relationship--you probably won't ever know everything about anyone either. But specifically to your questions, all I have to say is this:<br>  <br>  Communication and trust are the two most key elements in a relationship.<br>  <br>  Aside from that spark, or emotion that you just need to even want to be and stay together. Instead of driving yourself nuts, this is where talking comes in handy. If you have a voice, use it. If you can't converse with each other and have a healthy amount of trust, you won't have a healthy relationship and in the end, it'll either end up destroying you or coming to an end.<br>  <br>  Everyone's also entitled to their secrets once in a while. I'm not saying that he should keep that his feelings have changed, or he cheated or some crap like that to himself--but I'm saying, you can't always know everything and I bet there's always going to be something you haven't told him. It's okay to not know everything, as long as that something isn't a dealbreaker for your relationship.<br>  <br>  For break-ups... The way I see it: It's called a break-up because it's broken. If they don't tell you why, ask them straight up. They don't tell you--well, what can you do besides draw your own conclusions and tear yourself down? You can't just cut open their brain and nitpick for it, y'know?<br>  <br>  So you deal with it the way it is. You broke up. The end. It didn't work. Maybe you'll find out later on, but dwelling on it isn't going to do you any good so now is the time to just ... get your mind off the situation in general and begin the healing process.|`|4CsGde1qaa	Yes. It has happened to me, and I come up with creative answers as substitutes for the answer I could not receive back then. I always did that, because the girl never really wants to tell me what the real deal is, an example would be the last girl I had feelings for. As I have been left, without even notice of a break up, I start becoming conscious about it. I seem to think about it a lot. I wondered, Am I ugly, am I too skinny, am I a nerd, am I too proud of myself, etc. I then switch the tape around and guess, she has something else in store for herself. I never seem to assume that she may be seeing another guy, because that would just break my heart; plus, I can only believe that if suspicions arise to detail that. I try not to think too deep into conclusions. Last year, There was this girl I liked, and we had each other phone numbers(she gave me her phone number), but she never calls me, but I do call her. During the summer, it was the last time we saw each other physically. She now never answers my calls, I left her messages, I text her, but nothing ever came back. I wonder why? I try not to cry, but she was so special to me, she was my only true friend for all I know.|`|FebNOmqDaa	I would just refocus on other things that are more important and try to stay busy as much as possible that way I don't go crazy about figuring out about the breakup. Let time heal your pain and look at other ways to focus your energies. Hope this help.
PK5Elowdaa	We don't prefer it. The only way around it is to let him know that youre on your period but at the same time still offer him oral pleasure. I'm sure he won't turn you down. The whole period thing is just messy. Sorry but at least give him that much.

This way you can know whether or not you need to be in a relationship right now.  If you are currently single.  I would say go full force into your career. Figure out what you like to do and what you could see yourself doing in the future, everyday.  Then do whatever it takes to get to your dream goal.  During this process, try to meet new people.  Go out in groups, hang out in business bars or dinner parties.  That way you are meeting new people and possible life partners while fulfilling your career goals.  P.S.  The person you are with should never ask you to pick them over your career.  YET, you have to know how to balance.  You can't be a workaholic and still be happy in your marriage.  Your lover should support you.|`|H6YKDcjRaa	Erm ;; I would say job.

Besides, if you have a huge ego (the way your talking, it sounds like you do), that turns most girls off.

Someone stalking you because you used her for sex?|`|TdyoLSqWaa	If she knows you don't liker her then tell her you want it she wants it so whats stopping you.

E25Q16N7aa	tickets to a sporting event; make him dinner (or lunch) and take him to a movie; if he likes gaming (ie. playstation or wii) then a game.  Another idea is to make up a bunch of recordings that you know he would really like (either to work out to, or romantic songs).<br>  <br>  Although guys might not like gushy romantic stuff, they like to know you are into him.  My advice is cook him a dinner (even call out for pizza) of something he likes.  Rent a movie he has not seen (but you think he will like)

Sometimes we think we know them but we really don't.I wanna say keep on flirting with him because it seems like he likes you but at the same time it's rather strange why he only deleted your comments alone off his wall. One thing you should continue to do though is don't ask him about it because he might think you're such a big deal out of such a small and harmless action. Maybe he wants to keep you a secret, or he likes someone else, or just wanted to delete them off his wall we might never know but don't ask about it just yet only when push comes to shove then you ask. That's what I'd do anyway.....good luck with everything

3F1R0Pcgaa	Don't waste your time on trying to make her come back, she is not worth you time, effort, and thought. You don't want to be with a girl who has cheated on you THEN has the nerve to say she would re-consider her relationship with you if things don't work out with the new guy! You really should make her pay for her actions, stop talking to her, pretend you're over her, and often times that will make her come back...but you don't want these kinds of girls back. I know i would HATE being with a girl knowing i was her 2nd choice or backup plan, because that means when she finds someone who she thinks is better she will leave you again. You want to be a girls number 1 choice, not 2nd.
MoqhVe8caa	If you see her on Monday, ask her how her weekend was. Then ask what she did and go off that. If she's says something like: Oh I went to a movie. Ask her how it was and maybe talk about movies you've seen and if you've seen them too. Stuff like that. Even talking about the weather is a good common interest, and can get you comfortable with talking to her. This way you can know exactly what she likes and does so eventually you will have way more to talk about, and it won't be weird.|`|cyht3kSvaa	well let her know that you like her in a girlfriend and care to take her out on a date get romantic|`|TRSAev5waa	just come up to her and say hey whats up..make sure its outside of class if your in school because if you guys never talk outside of class she may think shes just a class buddy..so yeah just go up to her..maybe with a friend if you need comfort and just talk about anything you two may have in common..and if you have her number..text her..and once again if youre in school dont text only about class homework so she doesnt feel like you dont want to be more than friends..if you think she likes you..chances are she does..dont send mixed signals and good luck :)<br>  <br>  oh and you might get better answers if you add just a little more info on your relationship with her. :]|`|zv01EjTLaa	Don't try to impress her with things that you know.

Just give him space. You are 18 he is 21. Girls are usually 2 years older than a guy in the mind.

You are old enough and not young, you are 18 for God's sake. Be more mature. <br>  <br>  Don't be clingy.|`|cd5529dada3441913c5b1fda0ca0eeb1aa	you two have way to big of an age difference in my opinion.<br>  find a guy that's closer to your age.<br>  how old is this girl he always calls?

XTDeAfTqaa	Different perfumes smell different on different girls.<br>  Years ago I had a girlfriend who wore Obsession and I really loved it.

v1yefcFjaa	once you ask a girl, that you like, to be your girl...<br>  <br>  and she accepts...<br>  <br>  you now have a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  remember to treat her nice, chivalry is the one thing that youngins lack these days.
sPScyaF6aa	I totally agree!<br>  I mean the guy has got to look decent and put together but other than that personality is key!<br>  So are morals and politness and he has to have chivalry. And id love for him to be affectionate and romantic. But what comes from teh heart is very important! :)|`|eF92uM2Saa	Without an appealing appearance I wouldn't be attracted in the first place.  The personality is the deal maker or breaker, and so it is what matters most.|`|pi3UAJgKaa	its really a mix... like if a guy is hot, but is also an *** then he wont get a good girl... if the guy isnt that hot, but is super sweet then he will probly get a good girll..|`|2271d7578f9b8099c73f2dadf80821f5aa	I agree with you 100%|`|C2ngW2hvaa	Appearance is what catches my attention. However, if I get to know anyone (at work, school, etc) and they talk to me and they're funny, sweet, smart, make me laugh, have similar interests- it does not matter what they look like!|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I look for personality. Ok you have a good looking guy, but then he has the meanest personality and then he may flirt with other women, and treat you like dirt. Which will make him ugly in my eyes.
lqOxBiiFaa	Yes there is more than sex,<br>  if its just a sex relationship it wont go very well..<br>  I think that you should go on dates to places, and stuff like that <br>  and yes you should both trust eachother, and yes you should have a bffl in a relationship to help you through the bad times ;)<br>  good luckk :D|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	a relationship is a lot of things, like trust, love, fun, and having them be a best friend. sex is part of a relationship, but it's not what relationships can be based on.
z3jRrrvnaa	Because they're sick of being nice and bad guys introduce excitement into their life, I guess. And lots of people are attracted to people they consider 'better than them'. Bad boys tend to treat girls badly, which reinforces this inferiority thing and makes the girls feel lucky to be with those guys. It's whacked up and barely makes sense but...it's true.|`|YWlkpqWnaa	This is not liking which girls observe, but the RECPGNISING her among OTHER.It is the nature of human to be eager to be recognised.<br>  Girls are the easy preys for thisnegative appriciations.They just want some one to recognise them in any way.
E0lIm1u0aa	Maybe you should make a move first. Also there might be a reason why he hasn't made his move.  He could be shy or hurt in the past and he's uncertain of your intentions.  If you ask him out for a coffee date, it might show him that you care and are interested, without coming across too strong.  In the 21st century a lot of guys don't follow the "men ask women out only"  rule and he might be waiting for you.  Remember men and women think very differently- approach with patience and an open mind and be aware of your own biases.  Good luck girl :)|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Ask him what is he waiting for, why would we know lol? You think he comes on here asking us for advice?<br>  <br>  (funnily enough, I have seen both sides of relationships coming on here for advice but they didn't know it LOL)
DFDyMxU4aa	Ouch, seems harsh. I think that depending on if you knew she liked him when you began going out with him, it is right or wrong for her to be angry. If you knew, then you shouldn't have really been flirting with him. If you didn't even know, then I don't think it is really your fault. But just talk to her, and if she is a true friend that you don't wanna lose, I suggest you maybe break up with him or just tell her the truth of how much he means to you. If she is truly a good person, she should understand.
qS17gUVraa	if he talks to you alot,<br>  and isnt a total @$$hole to you<br>  and tries to sit near you<br>  and asks you who you like,<br>  and when your sitting next to each other his leg touches yours like hes trying to get close to you.<br>  and he asks questions about you.<br>  <br>  but there are exceptions;<br>  sometimes the guy doesnt show it at all and then suddenly asks you out which can be nice unless you dont like him.<br>  and flirting sometimes means they like you and sometimes they just flirt because theyre being an idiot.

Eventually she'll forget the feelings for him when she starts meeting new people.<br>  <br>  Trust me. I've been there.
WnqSaVWmaa	I like the way you think!  Time is our best ally.  You don't have nothing to lose and a lot to gain.  But don't go so fast.  Take it easy.  Be his friend first. Don't rush things. Get to know him and share some time with him, like a friend, leave romance a part for now.  Just be your funny old self, and have fun.|`|9XiTfsa9aa	You could be straight out and say that your not looking for anything serious and give him a chance but just remember it's the inside that counts...lol corny but if you def don't like the guy then just let him know you've had a few rough breaks and don't wanna go through another one...I hope that helps!!!<br>  =) Good luck!!!|`|wdbwl9l6aa	Well I think if you're not ready for a relationship then you're just not ready but that does not stop you from going out with him and having a little fun besides what harm could it do. Live a little but make sure you let your friend as well as him know that you're not interested in a serious relationship.|`|HabGC9Maaa	Im 13, so i dont have much expierence with this stuff.But lol i will try.<br>  I think that its more based on if your ready to date or not.And since your older you might want to consider a more seriouse relationship.So why jump in to one like this?<br>  Maybe it would be best to just be friends?Or you could just go on a "casual" date.hahah.It could suprisingly be worth it (:<br>  <br>  much luck bebe<3|`|i4C7T6h0aa	if you are not interested in him i wouldnt date him. you might hurt his feelings if you do go for it. but again you never know he might turn out to be a pretty cool guy. so first get more info about him then decide.|`|49f6cbd2686a9cc3b76dbadb4c520e99aa	I think its not bad to give him a chance whats bad about that, and if doesnt work then you didn't put alot into it, and if it does work then good for you or whatever you may want to do from there. Theres going to be guys but you have to be the one to give some of these guys a chance and you'll move on from your ex.

Right? =)|`|LKsl00CTaa	Everything and everyone deserves a chance. He does sound like a good guy, so you can't possibly get hurt right?

KTqdwG3Xaa	I think that your friend may be obsessed.
bee2g8LDaa	He's probably nervous too trying to figure out what to say when you say eachother so it wont be akward or anything. If he dosnt text in a week or something suggest going somewhere then see what he says  then sk oh so when are you free. Try to keep in contact with him and don't have his friends come with him. But don't keep texting him because guys dont like girls that are annyoing and talk to them 24/7 ik trust me ive done it before. :/ ha so yeahh but i hope it works out for you guys...Who knows he could like you again with out your firneds there you can be more confturble.|`|nAqu6pMtaa	I think you'll just hafta wait for his reply.. You dun wanna keep asking or you will seem clingy. I'm sure he will reply back when he's free.. Give him some time.

I personally don't think there is anything wrong with doing it this way.  If he likes you, he won't really care how you tell him.  I think it's in a way cuter than if you would have told me yourself.

If a lady can't come up to me and talk to me herself, I'm not interested. Sending messages via co-workers is childish. If you really like the guy, talk to him. I think you will find the results far more to your satisfaction. Good luck with that.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	You can suggest it through a friend but it's a little cheesy, be direct with him that way your message won't get mis-read by the guy in between. plus it's more personal and would say more about you doing it in person.

091LTWTCaa	Ask her to hang out with you. As you get closer to her, you'll be able to tell if she feels the same way or not. That way, if she doesn't, you'll be able to turn down the charm before your friendship goes down the drain.|`|KHtf2pDKaa	if she says to you ''hey sexy'' then she obviously like you.hurry up and ask her out.So she feels the same away about you....oh and dont wait long,somebody else may get to her first|`|UP33GlBwaa	How the heck can you ruin your friendship when you feel that way about each other?  If anything, it's going to enhance your relationship.  Sounds like you two have the hots for each other.  Go for it.  Time is a wasting!  How long has this been going on?  If for awhile (like say a couple of years) then you two are getting older and you need to make a move.  You're the guy so go for it.....she's probably just patiently waiting for you to "accidently" text her or call her and then she will respond back.  That's a great idea, isnt it?  Try it and see what happens.  You'll never know until you try.  If you dont remember her # or sorry, have her #, then ask someone that knows her.  Good Luck!|`|D7vdPDOOaa	take her out to a nice place. then tell her that she looks hot or pretty. then tell her how you feel and ask her for the way she feels for you too. but also tell her int he begining that you do not want this to ruin your friendship. and if this was a true friendship then she wouldnt let the friendship of yours go for something like this. and just be really romantic with her and im sure it will turn her on and will say yes to likeing you to. then obviously ask her out:P|`|cEfXbPLqaa	lol.

If she says no, then you can ask if you can still be friends. Your case is a common one, and also a way to lose friends. Check for signs when she is talking to you, like hair flipping, blushing, hiding behind her hair, or just if she talks to you a lot.|`|Ssce621Jaa	Dude you might not want to hear this but the best thing for you to do is just come right out with it because it seems like she feels the same.

Maybe you are just trying to hard,  let whatever is going to happen......<br>   happen.|`|st7x7Cjtaa	honestly, I've never really figured that out. it probably has to do with fate. and the fact that even though people want to fall in love, they are afraid of getting hurt. people are too cautious. have you heard the saying, dont fall unless someone is willing to catch you? i dont think that is true. you should fall anyway. love is about falling, and then getting up, & brushing yourself off.|`|OJQ0j3MAaa	falling in love is really hard....its part of loving! if u love ull surely get hurt in return...but during the process of loving that person theres always a big reason for u to smile and feel the magic of love....u just need to accept the challenges....keep on loving to know the ART OF LOVING SOMEONE!!!|`|z3QsWmzpaa	love isnt hard what make it seem hard is because if you give your heart to the wrong person they just break it but if you find the right person they will treasure it <br>  love is all about finding the right person =]|`|llIxkU39aa	its because you either don't feel like you can connect with them but you feel like it or its because your holding back|`|GS4IklLSaa	It's like a puzzle.<br>  You need the right person for all the pieces (character traits) to fit.|`|Npr6EvOjaa	falling in love...its such an easy thing to do...birds can do it, we can do it, lets stop talkin lets get to it...<br>  its from the secret life of the american teenager if you were wondering|`|de75c6103d62d8807f85d1c1ab0c7cf6aa	because when you fall in love you are completely letting go of your control over how you feel and exposing yourself to be vulnerable in the hands of another person.|`|WnqSaVWmaa	You are funny honey!  Hum, plastic smile?  Love is a mystery.  And each time it is more and more fascinating.  That's what catch our attention.  Falling in love is not that difficult, finding the right person is.

And remember always, start like a friend and be yourself.|`|HabGC9Maaa	Look if your having a hard time falling, maybe its because your just not liking this spicific person that much.Believe me if the person were worth falling head of heels for it would have happened.Especially if it were "Meant To Be".<br>  Plus there a possibility that maybe you had relationship trouble in the past.So your hesitating?<br>  Just think about it.<br>  And keep looking.<br>  Once you find that person NOTHING will be holding you back :D|`|k7hZ9Kruaa	its not hard you just have not found the right person yet.one day you will find that person and you will fell like you and that person are the only ones on earth and you will fell deep inside in your heart when you find true love|`|Ssce621Jaa	With me, I don't start liking someone until I find a person that I think would be great match.

She might secretly feel the same way...? It's not good to keep things bottled up. It feels better when you get it off your chest, you know? So, vent your feelings and see what happens.<br>  <br>  ask her what her type is as well. then, after you know, act that way for her and she might fall too.|`|sY1itvPkaa	Well.

Love does not change because of an awkward night.  She is not in love with you.  She is confused and this is a mistake.<br>  <br>  You should not have to prove yourself to her.  Please wait before you do something you'll both regret.  Its totally understandable that you were nervous your first time but its also a sign that you're not comfortable enough with her yet.  <br>  <br>  Love means consistency.  She can't love you one day and then not know if she loves you the next day.  You can't find her feelings.  She has to figure out what they are.  She's also not being very sensative to your feelings about all of this.<br>  <br>  It may be that you want to be in love because you want to have sex for the first time and really want to be in love when it happens.  If you pretend it won't be what you want it to be and there is no going back.<br>  <br>  There's a good chance she's embarrassed because she thinks it means she isn't desirable.<br>  <br>  You both need more time together and long discussions about whether or not you're in love aren't proof that you are in love.  In fact, quite the opposite.  If you have to figure it out, its not love.  This isn't working out a problem, its trying to justify your relationship.  There is a big difference.<br>  <br>  Spend time having fun and hanging-out and your feelings will become clear.  Put some distance between your next sexual encounter and this one so that the awkwardness has time to fade.  Otherwise you're likely to get a repeat of this experience and you'll both feel like crap.<br>  <br>  Take care of each other.|`|c4RT0sFOaa	sex does not prove anything... just that two people are sexually and physically attracted to each other... love is more than that so if she understands that then she would understand why you wanna wait...  so don't be pressured!! ok?! she'll wait if she loves you like she says :D|`|4rs0KXiTaa	dont be pressured into sex.|`|7cdfc5d9a205827b098980cae58531dbaa	If you have time buy her a nice present she loves with flowers and card. surprise her. if not just prepare a nice soft drink for her with chocolate and cake. Be honest with her. talk to her about your fears and ask her if she is also nervous about that. show and admit to her that you care about her. communication is the best way to solve the problems. if you are not mentally ready or you don't have enough knowledge about sex, don't start it. Ask her about the things she knows on that and share your knowledge. don't forget that the most strong girls easily feel rejected when are stopped in emotional picks and then they feel you don't love them enough and they pressurize you for the love relationship. what she asked is a natural reaction of girls during the shocks like this specially when it is their first time. take care of her and you.|`|f4tkpDZnaa	Heeey,<br>  if shes right for you she will wait, its a big step but afterwards it will feel like no big deal i promise, dont be nervous but dont let her rush you, do it when your ready and make sure she is the person you want to lose it to, if she loves you enough she will understand. <br>  Good Luck  x|`|7yW3UUN4aa	Feelings depend upon mood.

71VRvldJaa	You didn't say how old your boyfriend was but I think his comment to you was very rude and tacky!<br>  You're 14 yrs old and promise ring or not, he was out of line to say that to you!  You know he was out of line because you wrote I KNOW I'M NOT in caps stressing the fact your not ready.<br>  Young guys function on brain stem and hormones and there's a rude expression which is "a stiff pr*ck has no conscience".  Guys will use any opportunity to make inroads!  First they want to neck, then they just want to touch over your clothes, then under your clothes, then under your bra, then down his pants and everything you consent to, they will push for a little bit more the next time.  If you had of stuck your hands down his pants, his comment that he "is willing to wait" would have been forgotten before you reached the destination!<br>  If this guy is starting to pressure you, he is not the guy for you and this is where so many girls cave in.....because they are trying so hard to hold onto someone they "think" they love.  The problem is that usually after they give in and have sex, the guy breaks up with them anyway!<br>  This is actually a good weeding out process.  By not giving in, guys often get a bit snotty about it and their gone.  I think that's a good thing!  You're so young and your idea of love is sooo different now than what it will be when you're older.  Let the guys like that go!!  Don't be so quick to give your heart away.....give them time to show their true colours....good or bad!  You'll save yourself a lot of heartache in the long run!<br>  You sound like you're a smart girl with a lot of common sense.  You also don't need a promise ring to be true to yourself and respect your body.  I truly hope you maintain the morals you have....I promise you will be glad you held out!    Don't become a statistic for these horny young guys!|`|GRZVerixaa	all men want sex. but the ones that loves you will be able to wait and respect your decision if you don't feel ready.

The only exception would be if you had a piss hard on. First you should rule out any other source of the marks such as, mattress, bed clothes, whatever clothing that you sleep in etc. Then are these bruises or indention's in your skin. If they are indention's they are from the bed or clothing. If they are bruises then maybe so but I would think that you would wake up if they were pinching you. If these marks were lipstick or some cosmetics of some kind then you would have some evidence it was them.<br>  My only suggestion is that if they are doing this to you, they are waiting for you to start snoring and then they move in on you. Try sleeping with less blankets maybe you can be awakened by them if they are actually doing this to you.<br>  Something else for you to do is google BedBugs and see if the marks look like yours if so complain to the hotel, also ask the others if they have the same marks on their body. Lice and bed bugs may really be your problem no matter how great of a hotel this is. I always check between the mattresses at a hotel,the area between them really tells you how clean the bed is,.|`|uBmomdQCaa	Why do you have to share a hotel room with these 4 women?<br>  Sounds a little dodgy to me, but hey..<br>  They CAN be having proper "i know", if they give you viagra or if you just have an erection during the night, coz when you wake up, you usually have morning wood, dont you?<br>  What kind of marks?

If you have a girl already ask her to do it to you while your sleeping to see if you wake up, if not ask a friend to massage your arm use a stick to touch you around ur torso to see if u would wake up.

wdbwl9l6aa	Never mind his best friend. You have to look at this situation with two points in your head:<br>  1) He loves you and not her that way plus despite everything he is with you and not her. She might be his best friend but you're his partner and girlfriend triumphs over best friend in that case. He has a different and intimate connection with you that he doesn't share with her, think about it.<br>  2) you're the luckier one because imagine her situation.

(sorry, I'm not a guy, but hopefully I can help). Most guys can be intimidated by girls that are too flirty or outgoing, so if you have these traits, try to tone them down a bit.

Be gentle and show him that you won't hurt him. Hope this helps.

Wo5Ezmwiaa	If he gets real defensive when you bring her up, yea he probably has feelings for her. I would NOT be able to stand it if my boyfriend told me what other girls he thought were attractive, it would make me so uncomfortable. That's not a normal or healthy thing to do. But the way he's acting, is way too flirty if he already has a girlfriend. I wouldn't be able to put up with that behavior. I'm sure it makes you feel awkward and uncomfortable. I use to have a boyfriend who had this friend. She was a girl and she was very pretty. Even when he was with me he would seek her out and laugh and smile with her, and flirt and touch her. It made me uncomfortable, but because I was so bent on staying with him, I ignored it and told myself they were just friends. Then, after he and I broke up, he asked her out. She said no, but the point is - he asked her out. He had feelings for her the whole time. If I had to bet, I would say your guy does have feelings for her, but he's just covering them up like my ex was, because he's with you. I'd talk to him about it. Say you want to have one last conversation about it. Things could get ugly, so be prepared for that. But you have to stand up for yourself. That kind of behavior isn't right if you are in a relationship. Tell him you're a girl, and you know when a guy is flirting, and he is flirting with that girl and it makes you uncomfortable when he seeks her out so he can hug her and flirt with her, and you're standing right there. How would he feel if you were doing all those things with a guy? Stand up for yourself! Good luck girl.
AIftgLEGaa	It does sound as if she likes you if she texted you that many times without you texting her back. Why not give it a shot and ask her out?
4m9Hewq1aa	You could approach her after orchestra saying, "Hey _____, sorry to interrupt you but I was hoping you could help me with this measure (or piece)". You can guide her away from her friends and she will help you out if she is a nice girl. Afterwords, you could tell her, "Thanks, that's really sweet of you to help me." Smile at her and make eye contact. On the other hand, you could simply ask her, "Hey, how are you?"; if you feel like being blunt and confident (which girls adore). This question is far more appealing than "what's up?", it shows her that you care about her emotionally which she will appreciate. Best of luck to you! -Alice
aOjMf5SPaa	Not only is he a trashbag, but she is too. thats your friend, and she allowed that to happen. <br>  <br>  You've heard it before, but the best revenge is sucess.

Not take his calls, or have any contact with him if you can avoid it. <br>  <br>  As for the friend, if she came to tell you, yes, she's a true friend, if you found out for yourself, then... well, what were her reasons to let him phone her and what if you hadn't found out. <br>  <br>  Well, that should tell you for sure who your friends are and yeah, an ex is that for a reason.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	Move on, and be more careful about the guys you date.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Hmm consider how good a friend SHE is too!!

You know...the scenario where the chic leaves her man for a player, and she is left with no one...I think alot of girls are scared of that situation (of course, not to say you are a player).|`|i1T8yKhpaa	the only thing i can say is just wait until they breakup...u can then ask her out..wait like 2 weeks ...u can always ask her if she is happy with the guy she is with:]
0b7Ks5Ioaa	Well honestly,I think us girls like a guy with a good personality <br>  and a good sense of humor.<br>  For me I like guys who are willing to talk about how they feel or sit and talk about problems instead of just starting a fight without knowing what the problem really is first you know?<br>  That what I like in a guy.|`|uff3kOoFaa	this is me basically:<br>  - nice guys<br>  - funny/good sense of humor<br>  - good personality<br>  - respectful<br>  <br>  plus....<br>  -tall guys<br>  - sports players|`|Yqzr82i3aa	sweet.<br>  pretty eyes.<br>  nice smile.<br>  good personality.<br>  does sports.<br>  nice body.(optional)<br>  hot.(optional)|`|b9vdlrokaa	Well...mostly...if u talk a lot n' talk nicely....dat helps, then u should b smart, but don't show it too much, like for ex: have good grades but don't talk "did you know" all the time. At times tease her, by making her sort of jelous....but not too much, b/c that would cause problems..... and then just b ur self....that's the most important thing

96bedf01e5d060d81044f6953d8b3e6aaa	You can't make him like you. Not all guys go for the best looking girl, you just might not have the personality he is looking for.|`|fG84JFPxaa	He's just not that into you.|`|yDMaxiw9aa	Maybe he has his sights on some one else, or thinks that u r trying to hard.

AIftgLEGaa	Wait a while like she said because otherwise you will just be annoying her if you keep asking. If you don't get into her school, then ask her out again and explain the situation. My recommendation is that if you love her so much, try as hard as you can to get into her school so you can be with her.|`|ooJC99gmaa	Wait let her make sure it right|`|WWNEQ9dyaa	Well if you like her a lot you should wait, because you might ruin your friendship. Then I also suggest try to also get into the same high school with her as well. Hope this helps in some way.
eD9MdcPUaa	Well, I heard from some of my guy friends that they like it when girls look at them seductivley, and then bite their lip whenever the guy looks at her. Also, maybe try lightly touching his arm whenever he makes you laugh, and try twirling your hair too whenever your talking to him. Smiling is always the best to do as well. Goodluck! =)|`|oaVhxc8caa	Flirt with him....... here are some stuff you can say:<br>  "Can I see the tag on your shirt? I want to see if it says made in heaven." <br>  "If I could rewrite the alphabet, I would put U and I together."<br>  "Do you have a map? I just keep getting lost in your eyes."<br>  "I lost my phone number, can I borrow yours?"<br>  "You're pretty hot. Someone better disable the smoke alarm."<br>  "I want you more than a popsicle on a hot summer day!"<br>  "Hello, I'm a thief, and I'm here to steal your heart."<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Hope I helped!!!!!|`|BTn1i7z9aa	make good eye contact and smile alot at him you could also complement him|`|qZ23brcwaa	To me I think girls already make it pretty obvious lol. They seem to pay more attention to the guy when in a group, they stare/look a lot. They smile a lot and look at their eyes and they listen carefully to what they say. They also laugh (whether its a fake laugh or not). <br>  <br>  But i guess that's not always the case. Maybe you should just start talking to him more. Text him or something. Ask him questions or just make conversation about anything. You can do some of the things i listed above, but don't over do it lol. Just show that you have a sense of humor. I'm sure most guys like a girl with a sense of humor.
bOwpBCUiaa	just get really close to him, dont say anything, until he stops talkin too. then maybe he will get the idea, and if not, jjust kiss him, i dont think he will stop you.|`|82XPLs8Zaa	get really close to him, look at his eyes and look at his lips and look back up and, if he doesn't take the hint, then you have to kiss him, he won't say no.

So i broke up with him and told him that i wasnt  in a good place at the time and that i needed to be on my own and sort some things out.

Because if a guy tells a girl he loves them they think their making a big step. But then you want to break it off will just hurt him and he would show a little resentment toward you.|`|RRnK3BuYaa	You need to be complety honest with him<br>   Tell him you do not love him but you have strong feelings for him.

If fate tears you apart maybe its for the better..|`|ci2MHfVYaa	okay i know what you mean, but you need to figure out who you're really in tooo. if you like your boyfriend then thats fine, because you might regret breaking up with him if nothing happens with the other boy. good luck!! do what you think is the best idea.|`|MIeLuqUCaa	Do what your heart tells you to follow the path it chooses and remember love always has a price to pay|`|gMKrx3vxaa	Tell him that maybe you guys need to go you separate way ask him for forgiveness|`|jqsu76T5aa	well you know him more than the other dude if you know he treats you like the way you want to be treated then stay with him.<br>  but if not then just tell him that youre not really into him..|`|EP2TZWYEaa	if this guy loves you why would you go to someone different. you should be greatful for person that you have.|`|4pKIllAeaa	be like ur not ready to love him|`|wdbwl9l6aa	I kinda know how you feel I was in that boat once but if I'm into another guy and I'm with someone else I'd have to break up with him no matter how hard it may seem.

Honesty is the best policy...<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go that way you can tell him that you just aren't ready for that yet, and that's its not the right time.|`|wmDW2IkJaa	If your not into him anymore then that it that its going to hurt him more if you keep dragging your feet. I know that its going to hurt and its going to suck but you have to let him go if you are not into him. And dont be scared because your going to hurt people but its better to do it sooner then later. And your to young to held down so go out and enjoy life|`|XyrGLumFaa	Hi. 1st love is a strong word. from my experience when my ex used to say Darling i love u. i actually believed it. cos he has brought me a presents like love ring, necklace, Designer watches. my ex was mad about me, thats why i dumped him, cos he didn't gave me freedom,anyway  but if your boyfriend said i love you then ask him to prove it, <br>  <br>  okay i hope that helps|`|sI5SakRvaa	I know exsaclty how you feel. well i mean ( F ) it do what makes you happy. if he wasent feeling you he would brake up with you fast . but dont be selfish the longer you stay with him is the longer its going to be hard to get rid of him. tell him be like hey look i think we should just be friends im really stressed out im sorry . and if he hates you he wasent good enough all along hun.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its okay :/|`|0QTq76Shaa	He wont be mad at you, what you can do is slowly stop talking to him, then the relationship will turn boring, then just tell him you would like to stop going out...

I have no idea why kids these days feel the need to over-dramatize everything.<br>  So what if he hates you? If he's mature at all he can look past that and understand how you're feeling. Grow a pair.|`|tmpiMfa2aa	run run to mexico sike naw just tell him your not ready yet and save it for someone special who knows it could be you because if your scared to break up with him and he loves you you will be in a long relatioship so dont be scared just say im not ready for that|`|FpaWSruQaa	Read this and then discuss it with him<br>  <br>  <a href="http://demotivationalminds.wordpress.com/2009/02/22/demotivational-posters-volume-33/" rel="nofollow">http://demotivationalminds.wordpress.com...</a>|`|WnqSaVWmaa	Just tell him that you like him a lot like a friend but you are young and not ready yet to go to the other level.

RwoMW3PEaa	I think all guys look at porn at some point. Some are MUCH worse than others. I personally am not a fan. It just weirds me out and some of it is so gross.

KRJ7h8MYaa	I'm very sorry to hear about this.<br>  <br>  Well I can't necessarily blame you (because the word "blame" has too strong of a negative connotation, not to mention implies that you are intentionally at fault) but obviously there's something wrong with the way you are trying to make friends, or the way you are handling your relationships with your current peers (won't say "friends" because they obviously don't treat you like one).<br>  <br>  Or, maybe it has nothing to do with you, but you're just going after the wrong company. How old are you? The fact it, even if you do have some "issues" or some pending troubles in life, any reasonable person would be able to see past it. <br>  <br>  But those are two different issues to consider. Honestly, I'd see a counselor/therapist if I were you. It sounds like you are still very young, and this is the best time for you to develop your confidence and self-esteem for the future. I'm 20 right now and this is what I'm trying to do. And I'm not going to lie, perhaps it might be good to bring your parents along to the counselor, because it sounds as if they have issues themselves which is obviously affecting your well-being as well as their own as well. Is there a family friend, or close friend to your parents, to whom you can talk to about this? They might be able to reason with your parents. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|7yW3UUN4aa	Since you have not done bad to them, you need not worry. This may not be a good time for you but keep patience. They will be positive with you once they realize their mistake.|`|FVfBm86Caa	dont sound like your insecure you just said you talk to guys some girls cant do that.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	No one deserves to be harassed by other people for any reason. You might feel like your insecurity is to blame and that you deserve to be treated this way but you don't. If you are trying to seek out good friends that you can trust, look at how they treat others or if they are friendly because people's actions will show what kind of person they really are. You can tell in a big hurry if you can trust them or not. Forget about those rude people at school. Ignore them if you have to because that's what its going to take. Just act like they don't exist and they will eventually leave you alone. Just know that you are deserving of being treated with respect.|`|dlrximyQaa	I used to go through the same thing. You gotta get mean. As hard as it is to tell somebody to kiss off, you gotta just do. You get used to it after a while and people wont want to mess with you. You'll find that all the people who used to harass you are now close friends and they will protect you. And your family sounds like they need to realize that you exist.|`|HIlObAD3aa	I dont know how you act. Maybe it COULD be your attitude towards the way you talk to people.|`|gDnJ00Aqaa	thats bullshit|`|AA11085356	Are you still in high school? Kids can be really mean in school for no reason. I'm sure it's nothing you have done, maybe they just think you are easy to pick on. I used to be like you. Just try to ignore it. Some people just like to get the reaction, but if you don't respond to them, they will eventually quit. As far as the family goes, that's really too bad. Is there anywhere close you can get a job after school or something? Then you can save up to buy your own car. If you take the time to look around, you could probably find a beater car for a few hundred. At least it's something. It won't be long now until you will be able to move out, then you wont have to worrie about them bothering you. Life is rough. But you can't let things like this get you down, it only makes it harder to get back on your feet again. You kno who you are and what you are about, it's not your fault that other people don't see that. It will get better though, just give it some time. It's nice to have someone to talk to too. Hope I helped a little! Good luck!|`|bHQpwVlXaa	I'm sorry :(

If you talk about a guy who is looking for serious relationship then most of the time body parts do not matter. he will love her personality.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	She NEEDS a cute face with a nice personality. If your personality sucks it is a major turn off. It may be just me but I think huge boobs are disgusting.|`|3wjOk0Saaa	I would love to tell you in great detail, but I don't know how old you are. Most of my comments are pg17
3O1EcmrGaa	I can definitely identify with this problem and I will never date another woman with kids again unless they are very young kids (maybe).  My ex's 2 kids destroyed our relationship because mommy thought they were the greatest thing since sliced bread and believe me, they were nothing but lowlifes-in-training.  One is 16, is a vocal racist who does nothing but drink and does no schoolwork and the other is 14 and in 7th grade (red flag there in itself) who is already sexually active and is just as bad if not worse than his older brother with the racial and laziness factor.  She is a spineless person who can't say no to either of them and I personally couldn't stand it either, like you can't stand your situation.  I looked into the future and saw two grown kids who also would never amount to anything and would be living with us forever if we got married and it was something I had no interest in doing.  She actually left me a few weeks ago and I feel like a gigantic monkey is off my back because now I don't have to deal with all her and her family's problems anymore and can move on and focus on MY happiness.<br>  <br>  I understand at 48 it would be hard as hell to get back out there and date again, but my advice is to start looking around and if you find someone else you are compatible with and in a better situation, bolt out of your current relationship and focus on YOUR happiness.  Best of luck.|`|td6WXhv4aa	It's up to her has to boot his *** and read him the riot act to straighten up don't move in until he's out.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	there's nothing you can do... you're just gonna have to wait until the world slaps him in the face and he's forced to grow the hell up|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	Have you talked to her about her bum?  I mean her son?<br>  <br>  My 21 year old son drives my wife crazy too (not her son).  <br>  <br>  Do you do anything constructive (I mean like stuff you can drag this kid along with).  <br>  <br>  I know it is a long shot, but do you suppose he works from home via computer?  No?  I didn't think so.<br>  <br>  I've had that "your kids drive me crazy" thing too.  I ended up marrying a woman with out kids - she has to deal with it but not me.<br>  <br>  Keep your own place.  Explain your quandry and tell her it bothers you and her relationship with her son prevents you from taking your relationship with her to the next level.  Ask her where she'd like to go.  Perhaps her bumson is more important to her.  Sucks but is probably the case.|`|YTasscmKaa	I don't know what you can do, bro. Yeah, hes taking advantage of her big time, but she is the one letting it happen. Question is why? You need to have a serious conversation with her about that. There is one thing for sure. She isn't helping him by letting him sponge off her like that. So, find out what her motivation is and, then, provide your convincing counter arguments. That's about all you can do. It wouldn't help to go after him, since that would just make her resent you.|`|96ndKQncaa	.talk to your girlfriend about it, and come to a conclusion i am sure she would be just as sick with her sons laziness..<br>  have him to pay weekly rent and if he cant pay it up he should be kicked out... he's old enough he should at least want his own life and his own responsibility|`|t5MwoKokaa	well<br>  i would hate it if i was her son, and you came and told me to get a job etc etc<br>  it would just pi** me off so much.<br>  so i wouldnt talk to him yourself.<br>  <br>  maybe get his mum to.<br>  <br>  but tbh 23 and still at home..... kkkay.|`|5a5jZ1braa	u cant talk untl you say to her marry me & after that it's between her & him...<br>  <br>  U cant evern respect her to says she's a woman & not a girl so who are u to say anything i mean anything about her child...dont like it go find another & leave them alone...sounds like you're the bum and want to take advantage & get him out of the way of his mom so you can have a good time with her.|`|FVfBm86Caa	dont think anyone can help you here. you understand what the problem is except maybe you gf if she does understand then she should stamp her heels in and tell him straight. how does he make money? is their anything you can do about this?.|`|b4kKbT3Daa	Honestly that's a touchy situation. You don't wanna come out and say something to him because it might effect your relationship with your GF. I would talk to her about it and voice your concern in a subtle way . Just be cautious.|`|WOsd2lDzaa	damn just wait his *** is going to be hit and he will realize he better get the hell of his *** and make something of his life, try encouraging him and the mother to help him get his life started|`|QYTkIKmxaa	yo you should let him do him his life is his own so you can get mad thats his mom you got your own house so just fall back

ZpsbW8gHaa	yes, medical studies have proven that while having sex, adrenaline is pumped in the waist area and helps not only relax but increase flow, which is the reason why you have to crap all the time.|`|AA11085356	Eew...|`|AC0yjVJjaa	Medical problem with your body?

2l7lbcJWaa	lol the same things happens to me sometimes, and I pretend like nothing happened. Sometimes he looks at me with a smirk on his face and I'm like "what?". lol. Sometimes if we're really crazy or rough then When we're done I'll have a really loud one and I will crack up laughing. But we don't talk about it really. My boyfriend knows what it is, but I don't think he knows it's not something I can control. It's not like a fart where you can really hold it in lol.  I just made a decision NOT to be embarrassed about it. So when that happens I just put it out of my head and forget about it.|`|E8aYI0lKaa	Bottom line is..sex is messy and makes weird noises. <br>  <br>  If the guy is mature enough to be having sex, he should be able to understand that sometimes sounds just happen.<br>  <br>  No big deal :) <br>  <br>  Have fun ;)|`|1xNMtpkxaa	It happens alot more people than you think, it's not something to get only embarrassed by.

For that reason, here are some things you should follow when breaking up with him.<br>  <br>      * Keep it simple. The more he understands about the break up the easier it'll be for the both of you.<br>      * Keep it short. The faster you get it over with the better and the longer you are together the worse.<br>      * Leave no "maybes." Don't make him think there's a possibility of getting back together or else he may never leave you alone and just get even more the jealous when you meet someone new.<br>      * Tell him in person. If possible, tell him in person. It'll be easier on the both of you. However, if there is abuse in the relationship, seek a friend to tell him for you or write a letter.<br>      * Stay calm. If you are calm, he will be calm.<br>  <br>  Breaking up with guy is as hard as you want it to be. The quicker you get it over with the better, there is no use in waiting unless there is a 50% chance of changing your mind. Just keep the break up easy to understand and speak calmly and everything will be fine. <br>  lol good luck! (;|`|TuIrAXLkaa	well don't try to stay around and see if you have a change of heart I tried that I still always find a reason to hate him again later. kick him to the curb tell him he deserves better and if hes a stalker type move out of state.|`|BWM7NIA0aa	What do you hate about him?  Is it worth trying to fix those areas if you might feel better about him?  What attracted you to him?  If there is nothing in common anymore, then break up and do it nicely.  A friend is a good thing to have down the road.|`|XQWInrsBaa	Excuse me. U don't luve ur boyfriend then how can call him ur boyfriend. Just leave him. If he loves you why can't u luv him. If you don't luv him then how could you make him ur boyfriend. Stop doing timepass please. Don't try to hurt anybody's feelings.|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Take it slow because if he LOVES you and you hate him, he isn't going to take it very well. But the longer you wait the more he will be attached to you so hurry it up.  :(|`|kqxddLNoaa	If you are not happy being with him then the best thing is to finish it. Don't be harsh about it. ell him nicely, that way you may not break his heart.|`|Ni3hjtlsaa	Break up with him.

He must be sensitive to your needs, but not a wimp or a crier. <br>  <br>  - You know, that assurance that a girl will never have to struggle. My guy must be educated and thoughtful. Guys must try to stay away from being mean, arrogant, loud and rude, which are major turn-offs. <br>  <br>  - Unlike men, women prefer a neat, decent, romantic man. Most girls like a guy that doesn’t have a huge ego and loves himself. <br>  <br>  - We also like a funny guy who will pay attention to us.

When your with her think to yourself; "Would i do this with my guy friends?" and if the answer is no, then do that right away with her.  Also, ignore her like you've never ignored anything in your life.  Girls like a challenge, and you need to become that for her.  Being a freind means you'll always be there for her.  DONT BE!

I think you have every right to tell him that its over. Or at least give yourself a little more space to look at whomever you want now. <br>  <br>  I have the same problem with my boyfriend. His thing is that he doesn't say it out loud, he just makes it so obvious with him starring and looking at the other girl even when im right there. I hate it and I have talked to him about it so many times. I think its obvious he isn't going to change but we have a daughter together and I love him so much. I told him if he doesn't change or try it's over. I'm thinking about all the times he does that to me when I think about breaking up with him. <br>  <br>  It depends if you want to make him change and not disrespect you like that. Talk to him and see if he is willing to just keep his comments to himself and if he doesn't think about you like that. If he truly is sorry for hurting you then maybe give him another chance, but if not don't stay with him because I know if will only get worse. My boyfriend had a porn problem after his starring problem. It has since stopped and I just want you to go through that too. <br>  <br>  If you need someone to talk to e-mail me....

Tell him it bothered you. That even if he is looking at other girls asses, (he is male, and human) he should only be commenting on yours.<br>  <br>  And if he acts like your an idiot for thinking this, and doesnt respect that, dump his sorry ***.<br>  This could be only the begninning of something worse.|`|KoRuOhygaa	I would let him know that doing that infront of me is disrespectful and upsetting, but on the other hand he is MY boyfriend and at the end of it all ir is ME he is into and seeing. sometimes showing too much jealousy drives them away. if he is trully yours he will stay no matter how many nice A@@es he sees.|`|f7a45ceb69ac1d84687438607fa0a307aa	well i would probably be like wtf. but boys are pigs, they get fun out of telling girls how they look. i would say he is going out with you so it doesnt mean anything, he didnt break up with you to go out with her soo its all good. =)|`|n4OW84CWaa	Slap his across the face.<br>  And then say "Well, what about me?

KTqdwG3Xaa	Cheater is a bad thing.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Once a cheater is always cheater.  If he has cheated on four other girls  before he met you.  Then it's hard to believe that he won't cheat on you too. <br>  <br>  Cheating involves telling other people that which they want to believe, rather than that which is true.  And that's why you need to believe his actions more than his words.
QnmcWnjKaa	It's different for every girl. some love it the first time and some hate it  and never want to do it again. People are right on here though, do use alot of lube. it will get stuck if not. And yes, it can mess up you your muscles, and you'll have to use a bag for the rest of your life to use the bathroom. Not cool. That being sad, it's up to you if you want to try it or not.|`|2imXzBHbaa	Many women enjoy anal sex when done properly. The anus stretches and tightens back up on its own after sex. There is no damage if done properly. Use lots of lube and go slow until you are loosened up.|`|vtafeEIJaa	He who fix it feel it|`|wol6ECnQaa	Don't worry as the skin retracts back to its shape. It could be bad if done without protection as some forms of STD could be acquired through it (genital warts, etc.). It could be worse when done without the use of lubricants as both parties would feel a horrible amount of pain because of the immense friction caused by dryness. Women could reach anal orgasm when done right too.|`|8a691da3aa0581fc488729f65c39edb2aa	most women do not like anal sex. the people on here are so dumb. theyre just trying to convince you you will like it so they can do it to you. seriously, some girls LOVE it , not gonna lie. but most hate it. it just feels uncomfortable and really, why would you want to take it just so a guy can get off? and the muscle can be stretched and never tighten back up. and you will sh*t your pants for the rest of your life. :)|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Most girls try anal to see if it hurts. Then they try it again to see how good it can feel. And no, It doesn't stretch the skin, unless the guy is very... wide.|`|gXBPLitzaa	Well iv never tried it & probelly wont ever but, iv heard some girls talk about how much they love it & others say it hurt worse then anything. It depends on the person. & if its lubed|`|ESd9hk21aa	I personally love anal sex. I can actually have an orgasm during anal and I know a lot of girls who do it have difficulty with that. It doesn't leave it stretched out permanently, but you do become a little more loose then before. But that's great because it won't feel as uncomfortable the first time. The first time just like any other first time may hurt a little bit or just feel uncomfortable. But after a while, it just feels really really good. But don't worry about the stretching part, it doesn't. It'll always be tight, remember the tissue in the anus is much more sensitive then the vaginal tissue. The Vagina can handle rough play, but the anus can't. So if you decide to do it, just take it slow and don't do it rough. You could really damage it. But overall, anal sex is a really enjoyable and pleasurable experience, I think every girl should try it at least once.|`|q0NQStcXaa	It depends on the girl and her fetishes.<br>  Some girls don't prefer anal because it can be very painful. Remember, god created that area for exit only, not for sexual pleasures.<br>  If you do decide to have anal sex, then be sure to use lots of lube. That area is not self-lubed like the vagina is, so it can be lots of pain.<br>  Also, the walls of the cavity aren't used to stretching. If you do stretch them, this could cause bleeding and irritation of the tissue inside.<br>  And another thing to keep in mind. You can also catch some sort of sickness by doing this. (I forget what it is called.) For the male.<br>  <br>  It is fun, but be willing to take some risks.<br>  The more you do it, the easier it gets.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	no its fine, in fact some of the most sensitive spots on your body are (up there) sure your clit feels good and inside on the g-spot as well, but its fun and different. it will go back to the same old hole it was. don't worry. in fact when a woman has a true orgasm , she will squirt like a guy cums. and allot  if not most women need to be stimulated anally to get to that point. just cause it feels tingly and sensitive and like you have to pee, that my dear is not always a true orgasm.|`|DQPYoMg1aa	Take heed. Anal sex can be fun, ans pleasurable for both. But, the anus is ripe with bacteria, so use a condom. Also, and this is very important, do not let him reinsert in your vagina until he washes with soap and water! You can get a nasty infection from this. Be careful.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	YES IT HURTS!! YES IT STRETCHES THE SKIN!! YES, THE SKIN STAYS THAT WAY!!! It is VERY unhealthy for women to engage in anal sex.|`|GsznYH3Raa	you will love it but usr lots of lube and tell him to take it slow at first <br>  your hole goes back|`|C9ZV2Jt9aa	your weird lmao... i dno|`|fIdVORqhaa	At first, it does hurt. In fact, some people even say from personal experiences that sometimes they even crap or piss a little the first time! But don't go fearing sex from what I'm telling you! You have to experiment! Yes, it will hurt. But after you practice for a while, it won't hurt as much! But people like it BECAUSE it hurts! But some people DON'T like it because it hurts. I have never tried it, but I heard that it hurts in a good way! It's this really weird feeling... You'll know once you actually have anal sex!<br>  So, I wish you the best of luck!

IXskJPlVaa	Use both phone and net - what is there to loose. Direct approach is always the best - just tell her what you feel. Best of luck.|`|qms67wSWaa	use the internet so that she will have time to think before typing !!<br>  and ask her NOW just right NOW !!! dont waste your time ...<br>  im a girl in the same case and waiting for him to ask that quetion so just go for it !|`|uBmomdQCaa	Hey<br>  I think you should write a comment on her fb page, saying "heyy, i just discovered your phone number, and thought maybe ud wanna hang out together? Remember the old times?"<br>  lool, i odnt know how much you know this girl, but just ask her out, maybe go with a few of your freinds and ask if she wanted to bring some of hers along, and you can do smthn fun together, e.g. ice skating, or roller blaidng, w/e floats your boat.<br>  After, if you think you guys have some sorta connection or you wanna take it furhter, ask her out on a 'date' with just you two, maybe movies, or if you think thats too cliche, then ask her out on like a picknick date or something<br>  <br>  xx good luck!!|`|vXZSluiOaa	I would say phone her.  If it's over the internet, it doesn't seem so caring. You know what I mean? Tell her that you are going to a school b-ball game or something and wanted to see if she could come. Just ask her if she wants to hang out. It is a lot harder said than done, but hey, on the phone your both saying it and doing it. :)|`|XC7JPHKDaa	call her on the phone. The internet is the easy way out and sometimes it offends us. To make it even better, ask her out in person. Maybe ask her on a date over the phone and on the date ask her out.
A7nIADxgaa	I don't think there is actually a world record, because it would be easy to fake it. Or, it could be something as stupid as:<br>  <br>  Guy: Hey, wanna go out with me?<br>  Girl: Yeah, sure<br>  Girl(2sec later): Finally no, I changed my mind<br>  <br>  However, you can imagine that the shortest relationship wasn't anything serious, and probably that one or both of the people changed their mind about it.|`|FsttwYe3aa	probably .000000000001 seconds
pSicXtlVaa	It could mean he wants to sleep with you, or maybe he flirts with you or something like that, but dont overreact, it might not mean anything
0H43RTmpaa	a) if you 'think you are like in love' you aren't. <br>  <br>  b) If she has a gilfriend then you need to find someone else. Breaking up a relationship so you can date one of the participants is never a good idea. If she's willing to leave/cheat on her current gf for you she'll do the same to you over someone else...the other reason it's a bad idea is that it kinda makes you a horrible person. You wouldn't want it done to you don't do it to someone else.|`|tYnpVHpZaa	I have no idea what you should do but, if you do get with this chick could you please tape it and then e-mail me. Thanks that would be great.
SkCaqjEgaa	Hi,<br>  1) He thinks and believes you do drugs. 2) He has started liking someone else "out of no where". 3) He hasn't called/talked to you in some time.<br>  <br>  I think these qualities make him far from perfect. There is no harm in calling him up but don't you think you deserve someone better? I think letting it go and moving on is the better choice. Good luck. :)|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	If your not sure he likes you. make him like you. do stuff that will attract him to you more. but by what your saying i think he might have a crush on you!!|`|uBmomdQCaa	First of all, calm down<br>  Eat some chocolate, watch some movies..<br>  Looks like you two need to talk. <br>  Call him or write a message/mail to him, asking him to talk to you<br>  You need to explain what you feel to him, and tell him you dont do drugs or whatever you need to say.<br>  You should call  him to talk, and THEN move on. You should straighten things out and then you can just forget about it.<br>  xx hope this helped|`|BCNsuqgRaa	This is a really tough deal, because it hurts so much to lose someone you care about. I understand what you are going through, because I have went through this once two. It is easier to say, let him go or just be friends. If he thinks you are on drugs, try your hardest to prove your not. And the reason he's not calling you is because he doesn't want to hang out with people who do drugs. So today call him and make sure he gets that you are not doing drugs. If that doesn't work, try your hardest to make it through. Maybe you'll even get a new crush. Hope this helps and sorry it hurts so much.

He was exactly like your friend, he just didn't wanna talk about it - obviously, because he has been hurt. You have to let him get over it, and if you are good enough friends he should sooner or later forgive you - even if it takes a looong time. You can't tell him you like him now, because the likely hood is you just won't want him again as soon as you do have him - then you'd just be driving him crazy messing with head. Unless you definatly know that you could have something with him, don't bother telling him. <br>  <br>  You just have to make sure he knows how sorry you are, and that you regret doing this to him. He needs time - he won't want to speak to you very much or look at you because he knows that he will carry on liking you, which is something he doesn't want to do. I know this isn't what you want to be hearing, but you're just going to have to accept that you've hurt him and he needs time to get over you. <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped <br>  x|`|9khDFRD7aa	that was done in very poor taste! you can say you know it was wrong but yet you still did it.

It could have put him off you for ever, and I mean EVER! Guys arn't like girls, we don't 'come around' after a week or so. If he hates you, it your own stupid fault, but if he ever liked you you need to make him feel wanted again, if he came on to you and you told him to **** off then he wont try it again, because believe it or not guys get hurt too! Buy him something to say sorry . . . <br>  <br>  . . . make sure he is in and go around with wine or whatever you guys drink, don't tell him just show up and say 'fancy a drink?' he will have to come around after that! GOOD LUCK HONNY!
HpWCjBv6aa	Lol what?<br>  <br>  Will he do what again?  Like someone?  Uh you can't control your feelings, and it's not like he was cheating on you.<br>  <br>  Even married couples can have crushes on other people.

Osze34UFaa	That is weird.  Since he has not had a girlfriend before, he probably is clueless to the whole relationship world.  Sounds fishy that he would ask a girl out because he was "bored," but some guys are like that.  I would not go out with him if he asked.  He is a jerk if he would do something like that.  You will not get satisfaction out of a relationship with this guy.  Again, I still feel like you are simply a boost to his confidence.  There is no wonder why he has not had a girlfriend if that is the way he is acting.  He is immature and thinks that love is a a game.

ahN4se4Waa	it means he likes you. talk to him and be yourself. he might be a little self conscious and shy to ask you out so if things go well after you hang out for a while there's nothing wrong with you making the first move.  ask him out.|`|AA11028135	You don't get him to ask you out...<br>  Wait and see if he asks you out before you say anything...<br>  <br>  You don;t want to embarass yourself if he doesn't like you in the way you like him|`|7VBdPtIQaa	Sounds like he likes you. Go talk to him and get things moving.|`|kIqFK2biaa	he liikes you. just be cool and hangout with him|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Hmmmm....it could be either one. But, is he nice? (please answer with additional details). If he is nice, and not the type to do that, then he likes you. Most likely. it depends on how he looks at you too. if he quickly looks away,or, looks at you with a stupid look then looks away.|`|3NQizLOKaa	it either means he likes you or he was laughing that you asked him out|`|TP3lIKijaa	well if he was laughing then that probably means he is laughing cause you asked him. it depends on what other stuff you do with him. does he flirt with you? cause i get happy to when someone asks me out even though i dotn like them.|`|m43bYTrlaa	he probably likes u<br>  there was this girl that liked me in sixth grade and i didn't act all happy <br>  cuz i didn't like her<br>  i say just be patient and he may ask u out<br>  try to flirt with him and stuff like that|`|c3uFKxH5aa	hhe could have been laughing, i do that all the time and it sends the wrong message|`|ebR2iyJgaa	tell your friend to go tell him to ask you out

You see both good and bad in the person and it doesn't bother you at all.|`|156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	When your in love it's the only person you could see yourself with and there's nobody else in your eyes. You know when your in love and hopefully it's a mutual thing.|`|uB0r9LuWaa	You know when you in love when, the thought of the person you are in love with, being with someone else kills you inside. Also when you are away from the person you get a horrible ache in your stomach that wont go away, until you are with them again, or you contact them somehow. Do you get any of this, if you do then you are 99% chance you love that person, and please what ever you do never let them go, unless you have too.|`|g0xZ6ndaaa	you will feel it but if you are not sure you will keep looking at the person and thinking about them , and you will just think different about them|`|O8T5pIZsaa	If you are, you will know.<br>  <br>  That is the only truth you need to know.<br>  <br>  Trust me on that.|`|AA11083443	you just know<br>  you dont have to question it if its love|`|YGac7SAFaa	I hate to break this to you, but...there is no such thing as love
k59o2PZaaa	The best advice that I can give you is to pray about it. It may sound lame but I promise you it is the best thing you can do right now. If you have any contact with her in this week, ask her to pray about it too. <br>  <br>  Also, I would reccommend renting the movie Fireproof. This movie can work wonders for couples, whether married or not, who are going through a hard time. <br>  <br>  I really hope and pray that things work out for you!|`|vDTa9iMsaa	she misses you. if you really love her you will take the time and spend it with her. she wants someone that loves and cares about her and that will choose her over anything else. the army is great.. but if its taking up too much of your time i would definitely think of your priorities.
R6ljSjWwaa	I saw the movie yesterday. I don't recall any scene with people smoking weed... There are cigarettes in one of the couples' "story" cuz the guy keeps telling the girl he stopped and she doesn't believe him etc etc... You don't actually see him smoking tho. Only one scene where someone offers a cigarette to the guy but he says no... Or maybe I have a very bad memory and don't even remember the movie i saw yesterday night lol. But yeah, i don't think there's anything like that. It's a good movie btw!!!|`|VO1zmW4daa	ive saw it,but i cant recall a moment about someone smoking weed:/|`|3vKdohSJaa	i dont recall a weed smoking scene....
tG0swCe6aa	Not necessarily.  Sleeping around is just sex.  Theres a difference between just having sex and love making.  Kissing is more relevant in the love making category.  Its about the affection, not just the act.
RlgGkQjqaa	i am allisons daughter on her account, as i dont have one, but i am having relationship problems, and she said that this is great for us girls to get out what we feel, i think he genuinly does love u he is infatuated even at that.. But if u have got these bottom stomach feelings that you are being used? isnt it right that we go by our gut insticts?. I mean surely he knows your consious of yourself telling you to change is a sign that he wants to automatically change you from who you are, thats not right..You should be loved for who you are, no matter how much he says it, i think thats you should get out as soon as things start to get rough so you don't get too attatched..Often its the most deserving people who can't help loving those who desroy them, i think this quote speaks for alot of girls..|`|NQFV2AdZaa	I think he likes you but wants you larger to suit his 'type'. He's already asked you twice, knowing after the first time that you weren't happy with the idea. What's stopping him eventually asking you again? Also, if you keep forgiving him, he'll never learn and will think that you'll always take him back. I know you like him, but why would you want to be with any man who wants you to change? If i were you, i'd stay away from him and wait for someone who likes you for the way you are, good luck!
eevOrwypaa	I woud go to the airport with him. He'll like that, and you might regret not going to the airport with him. Before he leaves, spend as much time with him as you can, take lots of pictures, then print all of your favorite pictures of you and him and put it in a photo album. Give it to him at the airport right before he leaves. Then he'll have something to do on the plane, that involves you. And whenever he starts missing you, and can't talk to you he can look at all of the pictures of you and him. It will remind him how much you mean to him. Maybe write a few hidden messages on the back of the pictures, so if he ever takes one out to look at it he'll have a surprise! :) He'll love looking at your handwriting when he is that far away. It'll be cute too. I think you two should stay together. If you two really truely love each other you can get over it. 6 months will fly by fast :) Just call eachother alot and talk about your day, e-mail, text, IM. You'll find a way :) And when your year together comes up, maybe you can surprise visit him! I know you said you don't have the money, but you have time to save up!<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good Luck!|`|mefxIQP9aa	Go to the airport with him and then go to college. Keep in touch with him via phone, email, and instant messaging.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you can't maintain a long distance relationship, you should talk to him about it before he leaves.<br>  <br>  College will distract you.|`|xCAbKKIOaa	aww man idk thats hard but if u really love him stay with him as long as u can but idk long distance relationships are hard to stay with|`|yah14b6gaa	hi well the only thing i can tell you is to stay with the guy if you love him and he loves you there is no reason for you guys to break up. i just turned twenty my husband is 11 years older then me and we both met each other at school were both in the same line of work. we are merchant seaman. and some times we have to be apart for at least 3 to seven months.we have been together for like seven months and we got married after being only like 4 months together. sometimes you just have to deal with stuff. life isn't easy but if after six months he comes back and still loves you that means that the distance will help your relationship stronger.

LcEY08kAaa	when you see him in the hallway or someting look him in the eye, smile and slightly bite your lip, make it subtle.  Like i have a secret.  Keep him interested.  Whenever your looking at him and hes looking at you give him a sexy smile and look down.  When hes around make sure your always laughing and having a good time.  That alwasy works for me.  Once you've eye-flirted for a week-ish, walk near him and drop something in front of him.  He will either pick it up for you or he'll stop so you can go infront of him to pick it up.  Bend over (give some clevage so he stays until youve picked up your item).  When your back up, say something witty like: (giggle, bite lip) oops, sorry.  Look at him in the eyes and smile.  If he holds your gaze, introduce yourself.  Hey, Im ...  Now you guys are aquanted and you will walk with him (or beside him) until you go seperate ways.  Start a general conversation.  Nothing boring that he wont be interested in talking to you again.  Flirt with him, twirl your hair around your finger, smile, complement him, stuff like that.  Dont give him too much.  You want him to want more.  Right before you leave, Say something like: Im this way, (look down, then up slowly, but not checking him out.  But cutely) slowly touch your lips with a finger and then put it into your mouth then out as if you were bitting your nail.  Smile then say:  Its been good talking to you. See you later.  But dont just say it, flirt it!<br>  <br>  Hope this help, if you need anymore help from that point on, ask another question and i'll try to help... Hope that helped you though!|`|Ezt3Avanaa	Just give him little smiles now and again and try and join something he may be part of ( like a sports club or something ) then you guys have something in common and you can get chatting to him.

79Qtlxi9aa	I'm gonna be totally honest with you and I'll give you my honest opinion.

1w3zBbqxaa	I have to ask what so you mean 'you feel gay'. Are you physically attracted to the same sex? Do you want to have sex or be in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex? Right now if I were you I would analyze my feelings. How long have you felt attracted to the other sex? Most people have an inkling of doubt about their sexuality sometime in their lives. If its just a fleeting attraction or admiration, that's perfectly normal. However if you are seriously attracted to the same sex and have been for a long time it might just be society's conventions making you believe that you don't want to have a relationship with someone of the same sex. There is nothing wrong with being gay. Gay people are not the stereotype that popular belief would have you believe. They are exactly the same as straight people in many of their wants, needs and mannerisms. Just give yourself time. I hope that you will be happy with whatever sexuality that you are. Its a part of you. A really great part, but its not everything. You are still the same person you were before the questioning.|`|x68KtQUcaa	You are not a gay if you don't want to have sex with same sex!!!!|`|B51EJA6Qaa	How do you feel gay if you don't think about having a relationship with the same sex?

Wy0lUjP9aa	When you are at the concert, dress very nice. Not like ball room dress type, but nice accessories and get your hair done differently than you usually have it. That will make him stare at you, then at the concert, you are so into the music, dance and sing the music. If he is singing and so is your brother, join in, it is a great laugh. When you dance, I don't mean dance on him, but by yourself, have fun. When the concert is over, talk about how neat it was, because I am pretty sure your brother and his friend will be talking about it. Also, you will need to talk with him, that you make you seem like you don't like him if you don't talk and he will lose interest, even if he likes you or not. He is going to feel like he have done something wrong.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Talk to him. guy love attention. were more revealing clothes. but not to scandalous. c'mon you know were im going right?|`|4rs0KXiTaa	talk to the guy.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	go naked   lol|`|B6xfTbcyaa	NEWS FLASH! you dont watch a concert. you listen.|`|JE3OJXbmaa	A real bro never sleeps with a bro's sister.

I wish you the best i wish you decide to do the right thing.|`|094aeb51fddd6738244640604bb4b38daa	I would be more suspicious of why all of the sudden he has told you this.|`|U0pwzNYqaa	You should forgive him. If he is truly sorry then try keeping the relationship going. But just keep a close eye on him. If there is no trust in the relationship then there is no relationship. So both of yall work together to get the trust back and see what happens. People make mistakes but if he continue to mess up then i would move on.|`|3wjOk0Saaa	You should be mad. Not only at him, but with her too. How can you ever trust them. If he did it once, he will most likely do it again. I do give him credit for coming clean.

A betrayal is a betrayal. Some might even consider it worse now because the relationship is based partly on a lie, whereas if he'd been honest about it straight away you could have reconciled.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would leave. You have to do what's right for you, but the thing is many cheaters will cheat again. And regardless of whether he does it again or not, he did it once and was never honest about it. Had he been, atleast you would know that he's felt bad enough to tell the truth. In this case, you don't know.<br>  <br>  Goodluck...hope everything works out. And just know that a good friend would never cheat with your boyfriend either. Do what feels right and what's good for you. You have the right to feel whatever you need to feel.|`|Qz7YtDXUaa	You have a right to be mad, cause you just found out as for leaving him and moving on.... I would see what exactly happened between them like if it was a kiss or more and for how long if it was just a simple kiss and it happened once then I would stay but it was something like sex or making out and it happend multiple times then I would but you really need to talk to your current best friend, she shouldn't have done that, cause it was completely wrong|`|bYvGNvrvaa	You have every right to still be upset with him, just because he cheated on you two years ago doesn't make it right, he just now decided to tell you so its new to you. He seriously needs to make it up to you some how because it is not okay to cheat no matter what. You've been loyal to him and you deserve the same respect.|`|ahujYDBdaa	S h i t. Well, honestly it would be kind of hard to trust him now, especially since it was ur CURRENT bestfriend, emphasis on the CURRENT.|`|UhXfPAxnaa	Yeah. They lied.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	YES! I would be pissed especially because he didnt tell you for years. definitely dont just forgive and forget this|`|bYoGeKUUaa	you should be mad.!|`|jqsu76T5aa	to be honest with you if he was my boyfriend i wouldnt talk to him for a long time,<br>  second i would never talk to my bestfriend ever again, i understadn you love her and trust her but see what she has done adn if she was a true bestfriend she would tell you <br>  if she wanted the best for you she would tell you not to be with a guy that cheated on you, if she was a true bestfriend she would tell you the truth, But how can you trust her after all she has done?<br>  adn your boyfriend... it was long ago but hay you never know if you forgive him now and dont get mad hell take advantage of it and go out and cheat again and again and agaian.<br>  Once a cheater is always a cheater but sometimes you need to give 2nd chances to them.<br>  stay mad fora  month and bring that cheating thing up everytime you talk to him.. but after a month try to forgive him...and then he will know if he does it one more time youll never forgive him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|uB0r9LuWaa	If he cheated on you, he does not deserve you, even though it was a long time ago, he still did it, he was intimate with another woman, just like he's intimate with you, if the thought of that does not kill you inside, then i think you should really think about weather you truly love him or not, i hope you find the courage to make the right descion, what ever it may be, good luck.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	Well first off if he's the only guy you've ever been with how do you know he's "the one"? There are  tons of other guys out there. <br>  <br>  Next, I mean if it happened so long ago i guess its not something to get really upset over, however, at the same time....my motto has always been that once your a cheater you always are...<br>  <br>  So be careful!|`|WRh3tqUNaa	yes, you should be mad.<br>  that is never okay.<br>  you need to talk to him and tell him that<br>  you have the complete right to be mad/ angry/ pissed off<br>  many girls would break up with him and not be friends with her anymore<br>  so good for you if you can look past it.|`|iBi1GuDKaa	THEY R STILL FREAKIN OFF, EITHER JOIN OR FIND ANOTHER DUDE. YOU MUST NOT BE GOOD IN BED OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHEAT|`|65LqlxVxaa	You should be mad! He broke your trust and deserves some sort of punishment for it. But he did tell you himself which is a big deal. The fact that it took him 2yrs really sucks. But you guys have been together for a long time so I can understand if you're not so mad as to break up with him! You really need to fully talk to him about how you feel and maybe why he did it if you haven't already. He might not have an answer or an answer you like but communication is an important part in a relationship! I hope this helped! And I wish you happiness in whatever happens with your life! <3|`|K4SEYlBqaa	yes.! i think your bf is a coward. if he really loved you then he would have never told you .. to worry you, if he knew it wasn't going to happen again. i know that might sound crazy but the only reason he told you is because it was eating Him up inside and the only way he could live is if he told you and that is just completely selfish =0) the term "Misery likes Company" fits perfectly into this situation, now your left with the decision on what to do .. and personally i think you should dump him and get rid of your "friend".! their both horrible people and should feel ashamed of themselves >=l though if you truly do love them it may seem tough but you still have to let them go if you love yourself .. because frankly you can do better sweetheart =]
OX6FXzICaa	You never know, he really could be that busy. I would say try talking to him. Ask what he was busy with.

Why are you asking us this silly question? Do you expect everyone here to tell you that you're being a good guy? That it's okay to cheat on your girlfriend? There's an old saying, "You can't have your cake and eat it, too." What you're doing right now is what that saying is all about. You have a girlfriend, and she's the one you need to be focused on.<br>  <br>  If you don't have the balls to respect the relationship then you need to tell her that you are a cheating pig who is not mature enough to be her man, that you don't have the guts to avoid cheating. Give her the freedom to get away from your slimy presence, only then will you have the right to see other women.|`|UxbjvAaRaa	well i would try and stay away from your ex for a while. <br>  && if you start loosing feelings for ur girlfriend, then <br>  you can brake it off, and fate will see what happens after<br>  that.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	pig.<br>  how dare you cheat on her.<br>  i hope you're being cheated on.|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	THAT'S DUM !

5dSZUmcRaa	Well, for one, you've been with your ex for five years, so you are used to say his name while being intimate. Second, you did use to love him. Maybe a part of you loved the good part of him. But, I am glad you were able to get out of that relationship and be with a guy who loves you. I'd keep repeating the BF's name in my head to try to get used to it. Talk to him about it, and see how he feels. Explain it to him. To make it up, I'd have sex with him and say his name(just to make him feel like he's pleasuring you).|`|RriJAkPsaa	are you crazy that is so ******* bad you hurt his EGO even when you say he is the best in bed ever so get a gun and use it in your head or talk to him trying to explain that you did′nt want to say that and hope he forgives you and forget that name ,,,,i think he wont have sex with you for a while|`|nXO21jLbaa	Hi, I think the best answer to your problem is to print out your question you posted here and let him read it.

Tell him you want to show that you love him by being his sex slave for a couple weeks. Let him do anything he wants even if you don't want to. He will come around for sure. I know that I would. <br>  <br>  Just happens.|`|s7VCRYofaa	You need to re-evaluate your feelings for this man and your past relationship.  There were many times throughout the beginning of the relationship that I am in now where I found myself thinking about my past relationship.  We were together for 1 year and grew up together so we shared a lot.  Yet, the man that I am with now is wonderful.  I have no doubts that we are meant to be together and will be married within the next 1-2 years.  I think what helped me is by doing little things to help me put my ex in my past and out of my present/future.  I blocked him on email/facebook/myspace.  I told my parents that I didn't want them to mention him any longer and we both agreed that we needed time apart where we didn't talk or see one another.  It doesn't happen immediately but you will get over him.  If you are still having feelings/thoughts about him conciously or unconciously then you may want to re-evaluate whether or not you are over him.

Or maybe she just doesn't know that it is ill-mannered to talk about an ex to a new bf. Maybe she doesn't know you like her in that way, but she did ask about your gf. So she obviously is interested. And lastly, maybe she just didn't know what else to talk about and rambled on because she was nervous. Ask her if she is interested in you as a bf. Then tell her okay from now on I don't want to hear about 'ex' anymore. Then if she brings him up walk away. Don't say a word just walk away. Even if you don't hear from her the rest of the evening. Then if she calls tell her you meant it when you asked her not to talk about him. If she doesn't call you, then call her and say. Are you finished talking about 'ex'?

kvmWDuOJaa	It would be unfair to keep going out with Sam. There's no point in dragging it on, it will hurt both of you eventually. You never know, he could be beginning to feel the same way, especially if there's generally less passion in the relationship.<br>  Just let Sam down gently, and don't suddenly go into a full-on relationship with Sean, otherwise that may hurt Sean. Leave it a week or so. I mean, you can still see Sean, but keep doing what you're doing and don't go too over the top.<br>  You've done the right thing by not cheating on Sam.<br>  <br>  It will all work out in the end, and it sounds like you and Sean will have something special. You're obviously trying hard to do the right thing, and I'm sure that Sam will see that.<br>  <br>  If I helped, please consider voting for me? It would mean an awful lot:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h..." rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  Thanks xx|`|SW17FGBoaa	Even though you don't love Sam anymore, you must realise he still loves you so let him down gently.

3qN2LC3Jaa	Well you are definitely better off without him since someone who just makes a marriage proposal light-heartedly is better off single.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Look at it this way:  Now you can get on with the rest of your life.  Things don't always work out in relationships.  Better now than being in a loveless relationship years later.  There's many men out there that are compatible with you.  You just have to find them.  Now focus on what you have to do.  Start working out to improve your looks and think that in the end there will be a payoff.  Get out and hang with your friends.  Now you need their support.  Good luck.|`|91mSZBlraa	Hi<br>  This is a hard situation.  I understand what you are going through.

So it you were with him for two years it will take you one year to truly be over him.<br>  <br>  For myself I had to keep myself busy.  I made sure I constantly had plans to do something with my friends or family.  Being busy kept me from thinking about my ex and the breakup.  I was in college at the time and really focused on school and my school work.  I would just say keep yourself busy, and surround yourself with a lot of good friends and family. It also doesn't hurt to start dating again and to kiss someone else just for the fun of it.<br>  <br>  Goodluck<br>  rs|`|yBfOnvoWaa	It will be hard to get over a relationship especially if u were in love with the guy. Some things that will help 1. try to keep busy, keep ur mind on other things 2. think about how lucky u are that u didn't marry into a loveless relationship (divorce is a pain in the ***) 3. put urself out there and have fun and enjoy being single because when ur not looking for love thats when the right guy will come along!! hope this helps
PK5Elowdaa	The best way to approach this is try wrestling with him in bed on a sunday morning. The goal is to try and hold your partner down on their back for 3 secs.  My girl and I have done this many times and its great. Its fun and starts the mood just right. <br>  <br>  if you're trying to turn him on in bed, guys like it when females suck on their nipples while massaging their privates. If you can do both, its sure to get him hard. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try it and tell me how it goes.

ibFTUi1taa	Avoid him like the plague. Seriously, if he's not getting the hint yet, he never will. If he keeps bothering you, time to change your phone number, email address, etc. If he somehow keeps it up, then it's time to get a restraining order. He will leave eventually because, well, he can't keep this up forever.

He will think they are sexy will help in covering up your scars as well.As for scars around your pubic area, that really shouldn't be a problem if he cares about you at all.<br>  Now think seriously about wanting to have sex.

You are not crazy or weird, we all go through it. When you are young you form crushes on people easily, and you base that crush on characteristics about them, that may not be right for you. As you grow up you will realize who you really are, and what you really deserve, and what you will put up with before you say that you've had enough. Sorry to say, until then you probably will get your feelings hurt multiple times, and get taken advantage of. You might want to read the book "Why guys like Bitches." It will tell you what guys go for, but to sum it up, don't be too nice. Guys don't like girls that they can just have, they like the chase. In the first couple weeks of dating, don't always be readily available to hang out, and don't answer every text message right away. Make him chase you. He wants to see that you have your own life, and that's what will be attractive to him the most.|`|i6EQujNMaa	i had the same problem.All you can do if the guy u like dosent want u back is to accept that and eventually u will find sum1 u like even more.The first guy will become a really close friend.When your with other guys dont look for flaws but dont be with them if they are not for you|`|whR6j9JIaa	Hmmm... tough one because it really comes down to actually getting to know that person.|`|f17qh7Vpaa	ask my girlfriend, she'll tell you what to do or cry it over with you.
y80Tw8FKaa	Communication is key. You have to be able to talk to him and trust him. Girls have really good and accurate gut feelings but sometimes we exaggerate them a bit too much. It could be nothing or it could be something big. If he has no excuse to not be there and tells you what you read was nothing and he can't explain himself, chances are he is lying to you or hiding something from you.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Wow, what a situation! Sorry you're going through this. Sit down and talk with him seriously. If that was another girl then I'd leave and never look back. You need to find out why he didn't show up?<br>  <br>  Actually hes too much drama for me. He'd be gone! Sorry, I can't handle that crap! Pregnant or not, I would never stay with a guy that a @$$ just because I have a child. That just means he'll be the same way to my kid and thats not gonna work. My kids would mean everything to me and that as$ wouldn't raise them any different. So leave him and find a good man that will love you and your child for you and treat you both with respect! <br>  Good luck hon!|`|clnFe3aCaa	i think that you should forget about him and you should probably talk to you're parents calmly about you being pregnant but first you should take a pregnancy test wich does not cost very much you can get it at any super-farm like boots or something else strait away<br>  <br>  good luck|`|dcJxCkL1aa	kk this is wat a man will always say keep it but girl if ur younger than 26 ibeg u get an abortaion couse if u think ur not ready dont have the baby im a boy and i know that you should that n proby had a girl in his house or he was hacked this is the key to resulve it sort it out couse if ou don u may end up having the baby then hes out of ur life good luck|`|i3IKUOJLaa	Question him you deserve to know what is going on.

KjkOT5rfaa	from personal expeirence, i have lied about hooking up with guys and sucking a lot of dick. i have scene a lot of dick in my day, and|`|de75c6103d62d8807f85d1c1ab0c7cf6aa	ummmm....kind of iffy. guys shouldn't lie (but they do all the time anyway unfortunately). if the truth is something you can handle, i would just say to ask him why he lied about it, and then tell him next time you will not tolerate lies or else he will be kicked to the curb since he already betrayed your trust once. but if the truth is something you can't handle (like he's slept with way too many girls than you had hoped), then leave because he wasn't being honest

AA11795191	Trading Spouces: Meet Your New Mommy was one show on Fox that has been since cancelled and sold to CMT for reruns.<br>  <br>  However, they are still doing episodes of WifeSwap on ABC. Ive never seen nonmarried partners on there, but you could always try? Id suggest poking around on ABC's website.
71VRvldJaa	You said you're dating an amazing guy and you really love him.  Are you really willing to risk giving up the good thing you've got for a memory and longing of what you never had.  This guy had his chance and for whatever reason he chose to walk away.  I don't think I'd be in a very big hurry to just open the door and let him walk back in again because there's no guarantee he won't walk away again.   You outright said in your question that you don't want to be with him.  I think you need to tell him he moved on and you have done the same. Tell him you're with a guy now that you really love and he really loves you back and you've got no intention of leaving him.   There's a reason why people from your past don't make it to your future!  You say you don't know what to do.....but you DO!!  Don't even try to be his friend.  It will only keep things stirred up.  Say goodbye to him and ask him not to contact you again.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Part of you is still with guy #1 you have to let him go and move on with your life.|`|g10m67Luaa	If u don't wanna be with him then don't just explain that u moved on..just do it lovingly as to not hurt him to much.|`|JpWpauRhaa	Do it!|`|9vjxfIkYaa	date them both|`|9Ni21lHpaa	you were in love with the guy for SEVEN LONG years,during all that time he never once plucked the courage to date you???just telling you he loved you and all that stuff doesnt mean he means it till he shows it."i dont have time for a girlfriend"??for seven years??? how do u know he's not playing?I guess he thought u'd spend all ure time waiting for him,and when u moved on he suddenly realised,shoot! she's moved on!!wait a minute!NOW i want her!!Thats his jealous reflex kicking in....or how do u know he just wants to test how much of a hold he STILL has on you?the minute he saw you with some1 else he realised he wanted to spend the rest of his life with u?really?so wat's he been doing for 7 yrs???knitting??<br>  Really,he should've thought about that when he kept u waiting for seven years without so much as a date.No man who'd REALLY want you would make u wait 7 years for a date...he'd ask u right out,go on dates,get to know you so that he DOESNT lose you,like the guy ure with now...dont pay attention to him now,tell him straight out that he had 7 years to ask you out,and now you are in love with some1 else and you dont want to waste time.The guy ure with did nothing wrong,he loves you,hell,he even plucked the courage to ask you out...so y shud he suffer?Stay with the man who asked you out,the one that had the courage to do so...thats a man of action,that is a man worth being with.|`|3wkIDiD8aa	" but i dont want to be with him."<br>  <br>  You already answered your own question.

i6EQujNMaa	I would go with the one that's ur type and if u make the first move it dosent mean ur desperate it just means ur a bold independent women.<br>  About the player just let him know that u wanna stay friends and that it wouldn't work out if u guys were together.Hope i could help!|`|XOjePAddaa	i would just say that he is a nice guy and all but it isnt working out the way you want. be very nice and try to stay friends. then go to this other guy and become friends so you dont make the same mistake twice.if hes still good go ahead but if not you have yet another friend|`|3z3P6j49aa	Don't go for the player. He broke up with his girl for you, chances are he'll break up with you for another girl too.<br>  And If the second one doesn't interest you, find someone else.<br>  Don't date someone just because you don't want to be single.|`|c4RT0sFOaa	don't be a player yourself hehe... jk.. listen, just go for the guy you like the most! why would you want to be with someone you have no connection with? if it doesn't wwork out for you then it's alright, there a lot of guys believe it or not lol... :D
lP04jzv6aa	I don't think age has anything to do with love pet names. I think they come from your feelings or from experiences you share as a couple. think of him and how you feel and it wil come to you.
9mQC5Vihaa	If you guys are close and he hasn't put the moves on yet then you're dead in the water with this one for the time being. Keep the friendship but look else where for a relationship. I have a few girl friends that I "love" but would never consider dating, and I know they'd never be able to convince me other wise (even with tons of booze). Maybe something will happen farther down the road but don't wait for him to come around, you'll just wind up wasting time. There's a lot of dudes out there play the field!|`|44N2cgOjaa	well talk to him and get what he is like.|`|0KEWwUwpaa	Get naked and invite him over.. id fall for it|`|RElSzZtyaa	Hey Infamous,<br>  So this is an easy question to answer for me, however I can tell you it will be very hard to follow through with. <br>  <br>  I recommend spending some time apart. This is kind of a hard to get strategy. I can tell you it will be hard because I have had to do it myself. The idea is that he will realize that you hold a lot of importance in his life and hopefully it will make him want to be with you. The risk is that you drift apart... for this reason i recommend you do keep up with him, just to keep you on his mind. <br>  <br>  The other thing you can do is try to kiss him or something. Maybe you should go out for a few drinks and see where the night takes you. Maybe he is just nervous and will relax after a little alcohol. (If this is against your morals i apologize, you can ignore this section. I also understand that he is only 20, so use your judgement.)<br>  If you kiss him and it is really good it will hopefully spark something great.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, I am now 22, I have been with a girl for 2 years, she is 25 now. She definitely didn't like me at first, but we are now very much in love. Some people just need time.<br>  <br>  good luck with everything. I hope this helps.|`|B0UZQFHtaa	Maybe you have everything he wants but he is just not attracted to you physically. That doesn't mean you have to be unattractive. Its just some guys have a certain type. Maybe he is gay?|`|fc86fd8186452c131ac277bbecc2bb16aa	well the best advice that i can give you is that if he says that he doesnt like you like that then he is just fooling himself because if you guys act that way and stuff then you both like each other and here is the advice don't fall for him to much i know it sounds hard but you can do it try ignoring him a little and try being with other friends and when he sees that then he will realize that he really cares about you and doesn't want to lose you to someone else hope this helps.<br>  <br>                                                                                    Sergio S
5oCYzO58aa	Hi, i don't know how long you have been going out for but i'll assume its less then a year. Love is a strong word and some boys 'play' around with it so try not to take it to heart.<br>  From what i've read you obviously reeeeally like him, and if you want to get him back then you do need to talk to him, maybe starting off by dropping him a txt to see how he is, then when you get into a good convo start getting flirty ;P, or even start talking on msn (if u have it) and take it from there.<br>  <br>  (Sorry for the long answer btw) Maybe he just wanted some time off or sumat, i dno, but think positive and remind him about what you two had together =D.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do this and you just want to get over him, then i think you should start talking to other people, and get another bf because it will take you mind off him =D=D, good luck & hope this helps!|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	It will take time just remember that a guy who would hurt you like this isn't worth your tears.  If he was able to let you go so easily it's because he didn't appreciate you.  Just try to avoid running into him if possible and hang out with your friends, have fun and soon you'll forget all about him.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Simply put, you are young and there are plenty of guys out there.

Just don't talk to him for a while, until you're better.|`|cd5529dada3441913c5b1fda0ca0eeb1aa	have a night with your girls. he's a loser for leaving you and moving on that fast.<br>  honestly, not to hurt you in anyway, he probably never really loved you. he probably just wanted someone to hang on to.|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	find another guy asap|`|whR6j9JIaa	Grow up.|`|28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	Very hard to be Friends after a broken relationship, but that's one for time to work out. The best thing for you to do, is wish him well and hope they are happy. This will get him worse than any tantrums or mean comments. He will start to wonder why he screwed up a relationship with such a nice, level headed woman. Its not easy, never is, but it does make you feel better about yourself in the long run.|`|7VBdPtIQaa	It will take time to completely get over him. In the meantime do things that make you happy and distract yourself. Go out with other girlfriends or whatever you like to do that wouldn't include him. Plus it will drive him crazy if he sees you and you look like your not bothered by what happened.
whR6j9JIaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Some girls are hotter than others.
nKruEEuhaa	How old are you? and how old is he? <br>  <br>  If he is saying he can't see you in his future, why are you sticking around? It sounds like he wants to keep you around while looking for someone else. <br>  <br>  Saying that he doesn't plan to live his life being tied down to a girl shows that he sees marriage or long term relationships as something negative, marriage is sharing your life with someone, which is usually a positive. <br>  <br>  And why didn't he invite you out? It obviously wasn't a "guy's night" so there is no reason you shouldn't have gone with. Another thing is, he said he isn't going to stop being friends with her just because you're insecure .. so basically he's saying he doesn't care how you feel, he's going to do what he wants ... is that someone you want to spend your life with? Someone who doesn't take into account how you FEEL?! That's complete bullshit. You don't do something intentionally knowing that your significant other is uncomfortable with it. Now I'm not saying he can't be friends with her, you obviously need to work on your self confidence and self worth, BUT we don't get those feelings in the pit of our stomachs for nothing ... humans and women especially, are very intuitive ... listen to yourself. If you were to see this post from someone else, what would you say? <br>  <br>  Don't think of your time with him as wasted, its learning, you learned what you like in a relationship and what you don't, it will help you in future relationships and help you realize how you should be treated in a healthy loving relationship. <br>  <br>  Be strong, and listen to yourself. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
dJoE8yedaa	Make him sleep on his side...|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I snore, and my husband (yes Im a girl) is the light sleeper. He has to put in ear plugs. But on the nights, I have been drinking, or am really tired, i sleep on the couch. Its not ok for him to have endless nights with no sleep. Other than that, he wakes me when I've been snoring, and I roll onto my side or front. That is when you are least likely to snore. I can't control my snoring, but I try to be considerate and want him to be able to get sleep, even if it means im on the couch. <br>  <br>  I think thats the difference between being with someone you love, and being with someone you actually love. You do consider them and their needs, and want them to be happy.|`|pmkdQKEvaa	watch a film and fall asleep watching it - or keep watching tv till you fall asleep, at least then you wont be distracted by just his snoring - i know what you mean by denying it though hehe|`|QAEQqgzyaa	I usually elbow my bf when he snores that normally makes it stop lol. Other than that you can get medication from chemists that are like nasal sprays that stop snoring and you can also get none medication breathing strips (called breathe right strips) that go over the bridge of the nose and stop snoring. Good luck|`|AA11001353	My wife uses a simple solution the stop snore ring<br>  It's an acupressure ring worn on the little finger so it's discreet and easy to use<br>  Check out the website there are hundreds of customer endorsements|`|88K49bvraa	emmm try a bandaid across the bridge of his nose or kill  him|`|mvwKwgpxaa	this worked for my grandma and shes 58 years old no lie this works i also use it im 21 180lb play football this helps alot worth every penny|`|pMn2A7l8aa	I had this problem with my ex we found that when he put vapour rub under his nose before goin too sleep it stopped him snoring!<br>  <br>  hope this helps

scyLaz0saa	I understand you want to be with him as much as possible.  I think every girl feels the same way about her man. :) I know I do that all the time.  I think it is great that you travel all that way for him.  I hope on occasion he returns the favor.  You both need to find a comprise area here.  I would not worry too much since it has only been a few months.  I think it is just the situation here.  I do not think your guy is being rude nor do I think you are being to clingy (but again I do not know the extent of your relationship).  If he has to go to work that is understandable.  In this economy you really cannot demand more.  However make a deal on the weekends (Friday and Saturday) that he stays up later or around more during the morning.  See if he would be open to taking a shower together in the morning when you both get ready.  Just a thought (but I would try the first time be on the weekend. lol you never know what else could get started).  I would not make a big deal about it though.|`|88K49bvraa	no it cud be the fact he has to get to work has a routine and hates to break it im like that myself once hes not like the the whole time dnt worry about it|`|vPzA4eqzaa	Well understandably he has to go to work so you cant really do owt about it unless you wanna get him the sack!|`|cD98VDaSaa	Yeah i know what you mean, it would be nicer if he explained to you or say it a little nicer<br>  <br>  but he dooes have to work|`|U0qnzZeUaa	im in the same situation, my boyfriend uster say i was too clingy but if he says he has to work then he has to work, just make him cddle YOU while you are sleeping (:|`|BGyxjekKaa	Yeah it would piss me off, have a word with him!|`|1k6UUC8qaa	do yourself a favor and stop spending the night or making it so easy for him to have you.

2hcA3VP9aa	it sounds good but with a few changes. since im county redneck instead of the dark field i would be on the back of my pick up in the meadow field while listening to some good old country. then i would do the rest of the things y'all did but with my wife. as a matter of fact i think i might do that this weekend with my wife. good idea thanks

How far do you take it, when you fill the car up with petrol do you have to undo all the children's seat belts etc and drag them all into the garage to pay. I think that unless you actually know of any abuse, these little incidents seem to be blown out of proportion, especially the DVD one. It is always going to be met with hostility if you criticise peoples parenting skills.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	You are definately right.Anything can happen when babies are left unattended,what if they swallow something or choke on it,what if they drown in bathtub?what if someone runs off with the car WITh the babies still in it??what if some1 runs off with the kids.Does anybody remember Adam Walsh case??<br>  She is being negligent...i'd calm down if i were you,dont get furious,cuz u have warned them twice now....what u can do is (after u've completely calmed down) is talk to ure brother in private,explain what happened,and y u got upset over it,and that its happened twice and after today you are not going to mention it again cuz ure sis-in-law got very upset as well.Explain that u just got worried as an aunt,you only had the kids welfare on ure mind.<br>  This way u have done 2 things,one,now both parents are aware of the situation,and u've warned them (and honestly thats about all u can do its their kids...their responsibility...uve done all u can),and 2,its a bit like damage control,this way u havent damaged relations with ure sister in law to the extent that u cant see the kids or ure brother.and after that let it go cuz u really cant do anymore than that....oh...and if ure kids are involved...i  suggest u not leave them in her household when u arent there to supervise if u know how negligent she is.|`|M4EKmsIYaa	I would be furious too. There are so many incidents on the news about children being left alone in the car or anywhere for that matter. It doesn't matter how long they are in there for, the outcome of it is endless.

It would definitely show her how much you care. Very sweet!|`|hsvgllTwaa	if you walk her home...she will deffinatly no that you like her, it will be cute<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x
RUbjLoQcaa	when u r by him cuddle with him and kiss him that will get her really pissed|`|U0qnzZeUaa	Sounds like shes jelouse and she wants him, <br>  do something really nice for him but make sure shes there just torub it in that hes yours and not hers :)
JDvf6oIUaa	I shave it all the time boyfriend or not.<br>  If anything at least trim it up so it's not some huge scary bush haha.<br>  Just shave it every time you shower. I don't think you should have to shave it every time you see your boyfriend. I certainly don't! He has to deal with a day or two of stubble down there hahahaha. If he loves me he'll accept it.|`|08RugVdtaa	Shave down there whenever you think there is a chance that you two might be getting down and dirty...or you could be like me and shave 24/7;boyfriend or not.lol|`|RhZaVwKkaa	At the most I trim. Shaving causes unnecessary itching and razor bumps are never sexy.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I certainly hope not.  Imagine what it would be like if you married him.|`|g10m67Luaa	i don't shave down there...u could cut some of it so it wouldn't be as bad me & some of my friends do that..my cousin says it hurst 2 shave there.
AIftgLEGaa	first of all you have to stop drinking. do something that can help you gather your thoughts and is healthy. working out always helps me. you need to let her know how you feel without sounding desperate. only she can choose who she wants. if it doesn't work out, you may have to find someone else.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	First of all just because you broke your sobriety doesn't make you quitter just in case you needed to hear that. Every day is a new day. Now getting to the main subject, okay so this girl that you love, is bi and she has strong feelings for a girl. You need to have a serious talk with her and tell her to decide who she wants to be with. I know you want her to be happy so whatever decision that she makes you are going to be happy for her but at the same time you will be hurting and that is a tough thing to deal with because no one wants to be hurting. I really think that it would be helpful to you to really find out what she wants and go from there. I know you want to be with her so bad but you can't force a person to want to be with you. You don't have to be reduced to drinking if this does not work out for you. If you feel like it after time passes, try dating other girls or focus more on spending time with friends and just have a good time and that way you keep your mind off of her.|`|1eVVX3iAaa	im not gonna sit here and pretend im an expert but this might help.. i usually find when a situation occurs like this in a persons life they use it as an excuse to do stupid things. u say you have "broken" your sobriety so obviously you have been strong enough in the past to over come your drinking problem. no matter what happens with this girl you have to remember that the best thing you can do is stay positive with yourself, you are still the same person with the same thoughts and beliefs. if this girl sees that your becoming an alcoholic that will only turn her away. just be yourself, and always be helpful and friendly to this girl. if you can do that then she will see you as a good person, and remember you as the good person that you can be. these things aren't easy for anyone but their what makes us stronger when we overcome them. be the best person that you can, and she will take note of that, hopefully realizing that you can give her what nobody else can.. good luck!
AA10847497	Easier said than done, but getting yourself worked up about it can be picked up by people.  Trust me when i say it will happen as I was about 20 when I got my first relationship.<br>  <br>  Just keep doing the things you do now, keep going out where you can meet boys, keep being happy - if you can keep that image, then you will find someone.|`|jU2fhTCFaa	right your 15, there's plenty of time so don't worry. Talk to boys and dhow what I nice person you are. Its not the end of thwe world you've got no boyfriend. I ain't got a girlfriend and haven't had one for nearly 3 years (that wasn't too serious) but it doesn't bother me and I've never really had a proper relationship and I'm nearly 18! Tell yourself all the good things that are going for you and remember lots of girls are single so your not the only person in the world who's single. Anyway, stop worrying and stop feeling upset. Your time will come and a lot of people don't have a relationship till late teens, early twenties.|`|AcL6nWkdaa	ask out a guy u lyk|`|rdWeWvoYaa	The question is do you need a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  The only tips we can give you is that which is already apparent to your personal situation.  Is there anyone your interested in, is there anyone interested in you and what is the emotional needs you want met in a relationship.  Just because your friends have boyfriends means little that you should do the same and get hitched so to speak.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll be happy in the now and whatever happens - happens.  Guys like girls who are already happy so why be down on your luck, the universe tends to unfold as it should.
DMQgIWa0aa	Since you have only been together 3 weeks its the start of things this happens with most people, If hes quite shy you should just help by going in for the making out- whats the worst that could happen if hes kissed you before.<br>  <br>  Most new relationships start off abit rocky but then it only gets better, its all about Adjusting to new things!!|`|OntO6wE4aa	Your getting kissed. Are you talking about body touching and sex? If it's more than kissing then even a man who's blind and deaf can get the message. You just have to be more clearer about what you need and want. Just one time tell him to step up and give you what you want. It may embarrass you and awkward for him that one and only time. After that walk. You want to be happy and sexually fulfilled then get the guy that does that for you. Your man is respecting you. He's letting you know that your more than the need. He just has to get that message across to you. good luck|`|njNNT5hxaa	in order to get kissed you don't have to say anything, all you have to do is shut up. <br>   Look into his eyes and close yours...that is the proper way to give the okay.  (be sure your shoulders are square with his.)|`|hwKFm7H8aa	hahaha lol <br>  it wont be awakard for him...I am the sort of guy who knows a lot..and let me tell u..there is not more hotter, sexier than I can imagine but a girl telling me to bang her...that is so hot...<br>  <br>  u pull my shirt and ur like " I want it bad"|`|9vjxfIkYaa	maybe hes gay?|`|saLt3jSoaa	u cant do much to fix shyness but hes got to learn alot of girls are intrested in the shy guy but they loose intrest if he doesnt make the first move so all he has to do is realize that just give him openings and hope he acts on them peace|`|pj02ePxAaa	since you have only been dating for three weeks, i would wait for a while and see if anything changes. he could be afraid of moving too fast. if things don't change in a while, i would talk to him because guys are usually clueless. ?
gVyHUSYqaa	If you have your doubts than you probably shouldn't.  You probably know her better than I but if she's the sweet, genuine type.  Then she might think you meant it in a non pervasive way.  Personally if I knew you very well and you sent me such a comment I'd think it's cute, but that's me.  My advice to you is to say it only if you know you have a legitimate shot with her, if you don't than you should refrain and keep your comments on Facebook superficial.|`|toQCb5Jnaa	if you said that to her it would make her day... girls love hearing they look cute, it makes them happy!|`|AA11353473	I think it's cute (:<br>  You should try saying that.<br>  It's not stalkerish at all, honestly.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag1H2IyEWEQTaFzOTh3O9D3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090218175053AADcaUB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XKn14Qpjaa	stalkerish<br>  <br>  Any guy that has to tell a girl shes beautiful  or pretty or complement her at all is stalkerish<br>  <br>  You ARE stalkerish because you know she changed her picture.|`|FumLaOFWaa	I think you should just say something simple like "Your beautiful." and stop over thinking it..|`|MFlzqiU5aa	just say you look really cute or something. you dont have to mention that she changed her pic.|`|GYGXnBxfaa	SHE WOULD THINK ITS CUTE I DNT C ANYTHING STALKERISH ABOUT THT
ZNe6B9TQaa	The kiss on the head is terribly fatherly, don't do it.  Just give her a kiss on the cheek and do it confidently, she'll like it.  Also, try to use 'like' so much in your conversations with her in the same context that you used it in your question--it will make you sound smarter.:)|`|cFd00priaa	Do NOT kiss her on the forehead. Give her a kiss on the cheek. Be slow and confident about it. You may have to bend over a bit, but the height difference isn't so bad.<br>  <br>  It could help to give her a hug and kiss her on the cheek while you're hugging her. I think that's a pretty classy approach.
qJNevpELaa	OMG IDK SAY HI?!|`|K119R72Caa	Relax say hi get to know her. Plus you cant like a girl if you never talk to her? and how do you think shes awesome,she cant be a b***** you dont know you cant talk to her??|`|sjLUe4Kxaa	Tell her. Im shy, and Im a girl, and i'll never make a first move...I always have to wait for the guy :S|`|TRSxzUucaa	talk on txt or myspace to get more comfortable talkin wit her and then ask her out|`|oLV9D2Braa	dude u should ask her out or go talk 2 her|`|QkkKs9Veaa	You know what im going to do ? im gonna step up and talk to her first. Maybe say hi and talk about things that pop into your mind. Then maybe your relationship of her and your may develop more and more.|`|OEqxVXYVaa	well what do you think ask her out trust me girls love that, but don't kiss her in the 1 date you dont want to freak her out!|`|9MSsOwaFaa	Well some advise talk to her because if ur both shy its probly a better chose if u go to talk to her cuz its most likely she wont make the first move..get to kno her then who knos maybe u guys will get togther.|`|FsttwYe3aa	talk to her get to know more about her and come out of your shell|`|18560CRXaa	jusssst talk|`|ZpcFQpAraa	i would talk too her and i would talk about like how are u doing|`|8EK6Bj3Haa	talk to her!!!! flirt a little!! GO FOR IT!!!! good luck!|`|5gANvXyTaa	Well to start say hi to her, then go from there. Maybe ask her to go to a movie and then go to going out with her and stuff. Just dont rush, it never turns out well.
6DmsiLGbaa	Yes, there's a very big difference.  Family members excluded, I've told people that I love them, but I've never once told anyone that I'm IN love with them.  To be in love with someone implies that a marriage-type commitment, but loving someone just means that we care about them.
YUjSRiv5aa	I've never "done the deed" before,<br>  I'm young and waiting :)|`|VQu0SIO6aa	Midday in a public pool in Dominican republic! Nobody even knew...|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Lol ... wasn't that a tight fit?<br>  <br>  Mine was on a very public mini golf course.|`|568ac9941468bad6571c214f5eba0fa7aa	in a meat freezer with my now ex boyfriend
MCeh0uIaaa	You have to tell her how terrified you are. I would be scared too! Just sit down & have a very serious talk with her. I sincerely hope she listens. Good luck.|`|AA10500537	if you own your home   at the moment its very hard to sell but if you;re renting   maybe reason with her and ask her to please move before something happens to one of you.  honestly i;d be  ascared to.|`|KONp01Iraa	Tell her that you are scared for you and your mom. Be completely honest
3z3P6j49aa	He meant no he doesnt want you to stop talking to him, and he wants to know what you should talk about, and He meant hes so tired as in sleepy. <br>  Lol, and i thought I read too much into everything.|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	I think Ive been through this a million times as a teenager and it sucked and if I could go back I would be the one ignoring them and making them chase me.
T4tVKZ5zaa	wow i think you should ask a doctor. but im pretty sure it was that you popped then you got your period if it was 3-5 days. hope everything is fine! good luck|`|Ek00D5kOaa	well were u supposed to have ur period then? your probably fine and ur just freaking urself out|`|pwiRMmicaa	got to a doctor girl.<br>  but it seems like you just had ur period.
tWvM6M0raa	i think it could be your period<br>  <br>  although if you period normally happens at a different time of the month i would go to a doctor and get checked out<br>  <br>  there is also a chance you could be pregnant, i would wait and see if you period comes again and if it doesn't then buy a pregnancy test<br>  <br>  hope it all works out for you :)
pOTigVYPaa	I was excommunicated for adultery 3 years ago and was recently reinstated as a member in good standing so allow me to answer the question.? Excommunication or "disfellowshipping" as Jehovah's Witnesses call it is only carried out when the guilty party is unrepentant.? The elders in the congregation endeavor to help the person spiritually but when the person refuses all help and intends on continuing in the sin, then a simple announcement is made at one of the Witness meetings that "So-and-so" is no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses.? It took me two years to get my life in order which meant getting a divorce from my legal husband and marrying the man I was living with.? The Bible plainly states that adultery is wrong and was once punishable by stoning to death according to the Old Law Covenant.? Jesus went so far as to say that if a man kept looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her was committing adultery with her in his heart. Thank goodness we are no longer living under the Old Law Covenant or millions of us would be dead.? But thankfully Jesus as our Savior and Redeemer makes forgiveness possible for those who are repentant and who change their wrong ways and turn to doing good. Adultery is a serious sin that hurts so many innocent people and destroys a good conscience.  The repercussions from it last a life time. I always say that if you want to know what a Baptist believes, ask a Baptist, don't ask a Catholic.  Same as regarding Jehovah's Witnesses.  If you want to know what they teach ask them next time they come to your door or call the local Kingdom Hall.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	I'm not sure, isn't the church supposed to HELP people to become better? No, I haven't read anything like that in the bible. On the opposite, I've read a story how a fallen woman was about to be stoned to death, and Christ said that only those who are without a sin should throw stones. Excommunications makes it seem like a club more than a church. Sorry, there is nothing to explain - they are the club and the club has its rules. <br>  Maybe she can find peace with a different brach of christianity.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	I think it has to do with the morality clause.<br>  I would like to know why they ring peoples doorbells so early in the morning on the weekends.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Who flipping cares.....they are weirdo's anyway.|`|EdDLydH7aa	I'm pretty sure that they aren't the only ones who do that, it is in the Bible that you shouldn't committ adultery, so she knew she shouldn't have done it before she did it, my nephews father was a JW and because my sister refused to become one, he was excommunicatd so they take that very seriously, people that are JW's know how strict they are so if they decide to become one, they know their are gonna be under alot of scrutiny, but we are all adults and make our own decisions, but yes, it's in the bible, look under the commandments...and not just in JW's but lots of relgions uphold Bible principles and no one complains about it, for example if she were Catholic for example, would you have asked that question b/c im sure they frown upon people going against bible priniciples, i don't know that they excommunicate them, but that just don't say oh well...it's okay to keep sleeping around on your spouse...think about it...the behavior led to the excommunicaton, not the other way around|`|3WfAOPD9aa	The Bible strongly condemns all forms of sexual sin—including adultery, fornication, homosexuality, and bestiality. (Leviticus 20:10-15; Romans 1:26,?27; Galatians 5:19) True Christian ministers wholeheartedly uphold God’s moral standards. Jehovah’s Witnesses take God’s law very seriously. They disfellowship those who unrepentantly commit such sins, while they extend mercy to those who truly repent of immoral acts and clean up their lives.—1?Corinthians 5:11-13; 2?Corinthians 2:5-8.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cooperating with the Scriptural arrangement to disfellowship and shun unrepentant wrongdoers is beneficial. It preserves the cleanness of the congregation and distinguishes us as upholders of the Bible’s high moral standards. (1?Pet. 1:14-16) It protects us from corrupting influences. (Gal. 5:7-9) It also affords the wrongdoer an opportunity to benefit fully from the discipline received, which can help him to produce “peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.”—Heb. 12:11.<br>  <br>  <br>  **I'm sure more Witnesses would answer this question if it was posted in the Religion and Spirituality section.**|`|mCUqrRAjaa	We do not want to contaminate the spiritual paradise with the leaven of sin. The offenders must feel the love and expressed judical punishment to shame them into months or years of intentional shunning and isolation this will move them to comply with the social norms set by Brooklyn headquarters. The prodigal son parable is a prime example.<br>  Jesus shunned all sorts of people, tax collectors, prostitutes, the lame and disinfranchised to keep himself and his disciples clean and free from contamination. He taught his disciples to expell those who broke the law seeking relief from disease or life threatening illnesses. The inspired flock book describes all this in great detail.|`|WA8feS8taa	Yes, the Bible preaches that you should not commit adultery, you should never cheat on your husband or wife. It's one of the ten commandments, thou shalt not kill, thou salt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, thou shalt not commit adultery etc.|`|e1oky4jSaa	I am not sure, I am puzzled by many of the practices of the Jehovah's Witnessess. Like prefering to die rather than receive blood products if they need it, or thinking that only a certain few JW's will get to heaven. It just doesn't make sense to me.|`|qtOTa4iAaa	Adultery is a sin you know.  And how bad a person is she. She must have known the rules of her church and went against them anyway.|`|q4xyfJtAaa	Commiting adultery goes against a commandment.  The one that says thou shall not commit adultery.|`|ScHW4842aa	its a pretty clear message - dont cheat your spouse. <br>  we dont tollerate immoral people  - no hypocracy in this church. <br>  DUH - jeez.. of course its part of the ten commandments! <br>  Thou shall not commit adultery!<br>  <br>  No offense - but this question is really rediculous. <br>  Its like asking <br>  'Why do wives kick husbands out of the house after they have an affiar?' or vice versa.
gVTIHUxaaa	I wouldn't get back with him.I mean he cheated on you twice!!!<br>  And he says he won't do it again. -.-
F3KkB4GWaa	Ha ha seriously its feast or famine. And theres nothing wrong with having high standards for a guy you want to date being choosy will save you time and grief in a relationship that you know deep down wont work. Life's too short if you really want to go for the other guy dont stay with the first guy just for security or because you feel bad for him.|`|lyDzjMfcaa	Well women are more like trains in snow.  They're always severely delayed and when one finally comes there are a ton of guys after it.|`|swL7bQfAaa	It's all in the mind. Check the timetable, you will see there are plenty of alternate routes - just take one, hop on and enjoy the ride!<br>  <br>   problem is, you are suffering tunnel vision and lock onto one idea and expect only one thing can take you to the destination you require - when in fact there are a dozen different ways to the same destination.|`|EdDLydH7aa	boredom can be a relationship ender and if you really like the first guy then you can find other things to do bring the spice back, your new guy friend may be cool and all that and you guys have a good connection, that's all good, but you said you still like your bf, so don't rush to quickly to break up with him, give him a chance and don't try to focus on the negatives...give your bf a chance...good luck|`|Zjo0ownraa	may be they dont have enough fuel to keep them going
nfBr2dpZaa	yeah personally Id definitely prefer it if the girl makes the first move. Although I dont mind making the first move, for example a few days ago i asked this girl out (she said no but it doesnt really matter), Id rather a girl approach me because you have to remember that us guys lack confidence to a certain extent as well, when we see a girl we think is hot we are just as scared of rejection and being desperate as you would be if you saw a guy you liked. Especially these days it isnt easy for guys because were expected to always make the first move, so yeah i love it if a girl makes the first move makes it so much easier then just see how it goes from there. It wont seem desperate as long as you dont start slobbering all over the guy and just speak to him and make chat<br>  hope this helps|`|dAd2o6udaa	i can never make the first move when im with a girl. i don't know what it is, but i just can't|`|Qv57dITWaa	Yea we sometimes do. But deep down, all guys know what the score is. The guy should ask first, it's written in stone and in our blood.|`|zYOQ6iTgaa	yes most guys are just as scared about that as you are and we wish that girls would make the first move once and a while
51lPwFuJaa	Dude, she likes you. I know this is going to be super weird for you, seeing that you guys are pretty close. She probably snapped at you becasue she wants to tell you this and not have all your friends there when she does. She's nervous and doesn't want to harm your friendship.<br>  <br>  And she probably wanted you to see twilight with you because it is a love story. <br>  <br>  When they go to the bathroom, they are talking about you and how she can get closer to you, what she should say, how's she feeling. It's what girls do. You'll get use to it, as you et older.|`|ooRxjLXcaa	OH MY GOSH! <br>  she is only spelling it out for you.  she LIKES you! she wanted to go to the movie with just you! not you and your friends silly. and when she said it was hard to explain she was meaning she doesn't know how to tell you that she likes you.<br>  <br>  wow/ and guys think we are complicated. hahahah jk.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]<br>  <br>  -Missy|`|31gN5L58aa	maybe she likes you, and she just wanted to be "alone" with you<br>  and maybe her friends, were helping her with this "ordeal"<br>  maybe she was just pms-y...<br>  :) probably....lol|`|sR7jM0UCaa	Okay first, the reason why she always fix her hair is probably because she is trying to get your attention and/or to impress you.<br>  <br>  Second, she wanted you and only you to watch Twilight with her. Not with your friends. Twilight is a romantic movie. You and her and Twilight *hint* *hint* - yes she definitely likes you.<br>  <br>  Third, they were in the bathroom talking about you. She was probably really mad and talked about it with her friends. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  I repeat, she likes you!<br>  =]|`|qU9Et5qmaa	im pretty sure she like you...<br>  <br>  shes always fixing her hair because she probably wants to make sure she looks good in front of you even if she already does<br>  <br>  she probably wanted to see twilight-a romantic movie-instead of yes man-a comedy-because she wanted to get closer to you etc...<br>  <br>  she probably got mad when ur friends showed up because she probably doesnt want to try and get closer to you with ur friends right there watching her/you<br>  <br>  and most of the time when me and my friends go into the bathroom we dont even go to the bathroom, we just talk and fix our hair, makeup.etc.|`|RI1brp91aa	God your stupid. <br>  <br>  okay well girl's usually talk in the bathroom.<br>  She likes you.<br>  <br>  She wanted to see twilight with just you because it's a romance drama/action movie.<br>  <br>  She wanted alone time with you.<br>  <br>  Yes man isn't an ideal movie for girls.<br>  <br>  they were probably making her feel better in the bathroom|`|py25T599aa	she likes you and wants to spend time alone with you|`|PRi3qIJEaa	SHE JUST STARTED TO LIKE YOU AND SHE wanted to tell you at the movies thats why she got mad because you invited your friends and girls like romantic movies more than comedy (most girls) they took long in the restroom because she was fixing herself up so you can notice her and  she was talking about you in the restroom with her friends|`|fbHA13meaa	we just LIVE to make u confused haha jk. Its actuallt becuz i think she might like u if she acts like that...fixing her hair its cuz she wants to look good to impress someone...who i think might be u. in the bathroom shes making herself look pretty with makeup anf stuff. she wanted to be alone with u at the movies.|`|PV9YFZNmaa	do you need to be hit in the head with a brick? she wants to take your relationship to that next level she wants to look the best she can for you and she wants to spend time alone with you. go for it and have fun just be a gentlemen treat her with respect.|`|HA9A8kKbaa	quote:"what the hell were they doing in the bathroom for so long?!!" talking about you guys!|`|4t0b3gukaa	dude i think she likes U!!!<br>  and shes wanted 2 go see that movie w/U ( just u 2)|`|1BaeFYnEaa	Well... Twilight... Is a romantic movie. And I think she was hitting on you, because she wanted to be alone with you (don't worry, I pity you, girls are so mad about this movie and guys hate it). That's why she got mad. You didn't give in and your friends came along.<br>  The bathroom mystery is again this girl thing. They like talking and gossiping in the bathroom. Girl time. I think they stay in there forever because they were walking in, started a conversation and after that they just can't stop anymore!!<br>  And another thing some girls have. When they don't know about relationships, they tend to want that guys think like girls. They think for some silly reason that guys like girly stuff too. They just can't understand that guys find romantic movies boring and that they don't dream of fluffy hearts and candles. But they'll eventually learn how to get along with them...<br>  She was quiet because she was upset. AND!! She WANTS that you KNOW what you did wrong. Because they think it's obvious. But it's not! It's their terrible craving for attention that makes them see it that way. When you'll know more girls, you'll start to detect their strange reasons for doing a show.<br>  I wonder if she said anything else instead of "It's kinda hard to explain" If it's hard for her, it means she can't just tell you. So she's doing those strange romanticky things to make you realise and take the first step. Cause she's too afraid to.<br>  But don't jump her now!! Try something more... Discreet. Like... When you watch TV, gently put your hand over hers. If she doesn't move or say a word and keeps silent, caress her hand. If she still is like a stone, ask her if it bothers her. If she says no, it means she likes it. Put your arm behind her head. If it still runs silent and she doesn't get mad, pull her near to her.<br>  Hopefully she'll make a move too!!<br>  <br>  AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE HER: ignore what I wrote earlier and tell her sorry, I don't want to upset you, but I really don't like romantic movies.|`|Hw1vtgpZaa	Well I'm a girl and I think that your friend probably really wanted to see the movie Twilight and was looking forward to it so she was annoyed when you wanted to see Yes Man. <br>  I'm not sure why she was acting weird if normally she doesn't have a problem with you bringing your friends. Maybe she wanted to tell you something and didn't want anybody else to be there when she told you. <br>  <br>  When the girls are in the bathroom they were talking, talking, talking. That's what all girls do. It happens at my schools every day. It's annoying because they all crowd around and there is no room. But, anyway, the girls were talking in the bathroom (probably about you and your guy friends....girls gossip about everything).<br>  <br>  Well, I hope I helped!|`|o28ymqckaa	For 1 they were talking in the bathroom. She probably called them over when she saw that you brought your friends. She obviously likes you and wanted some alone time with you. And Twilight is about a relationship so it would kind of make it seem more romantic. When she fixes her hair a lot, she's trying to make herself look good for you. Maybe you should ask her to go to a movie just the two of you. She said it was hard to explain because she's too shy to tell you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
eGpOIV12aa	depends on what he is doing when he calls.<br>  <br>  if he is trying to see you or do things with you behind the new girls back then he might be a player that is using both of you<br>  <br>  if he is just checking in and see how your life is going, then he probably loves you but not in love with you.<br>  <br>  there is a difference in loving someone and being in love with someone
h0ZdSxQiaa	youre actually heathy for your height so dont think that you are coz youre totally not!!!! have confidence girl!!! youre fine!!|`|jcABVxmfaa	No!!! Dont worry! You are not fat! Im sorry i dont have any pictures of people that height, but i have a friend who is 5'4 and weighs 125. Trust Me though, i am not trying to be one of those people who say everyone is thin, and not fat, but you actually are not fat at all!<br>  Hope It Helps!<br>  =]|`|BNdoUMaraa	Um. No. That's not fat.|`|c1GimExEaa	no.. i am 5'5 and i weigh like 125. so no you are not fat =]|`|G2J5m25Vaa	NO!!! that is not fatness you r worrying about nothing.|`|o3d3NBVzaa	Wrong section.<br>  <br>  Also, hard to tell. Many factors to consider. I'm 5'8, 200lbs, which by conventional standards means I'm obese. But I'm not, I just have a stocky muscular frame and thick bones, and I'm a little overweight.|`|b25065caf34b81dfca3b01c2d8cc99aaaa	Yes indeed!!! Can you say OBESE!!??? You're so fat you have your own zip code....<br>  you ask a stupid question you are going to get a stupid answer!!|`|Tg6ySuUOaa	that is totally normal|`|0VLirxVtaa	That is not fat at all. Don't worry about it. You probably look fine.|`|oaVhxc8caa	NOOOOO......... that is a healthy weight!!!!!|`|maVptaMZaa	No, that's normal.
8G0PhjlPaa	girl..if you never have a BF until college that is awesome! they are trouble. i am just like you i have never had a real boyfriend and i am fine with that. i really don't mean to sound stuck up but i am a pretty girl and many people tell me all the time. its not always about looks. many of the guys that have ever liked me have just wanted sex from me cuz they thought i was hot so i turned them down cuz i knew wat they were up to. i know i have an awesome sense of humor and good personality and i know one day a guy will appreciate me for that not just my looks.... so this should be the same for you. you are still young you have time.being single its not so bad.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you are not fat! you just need to learn to love yourself and be confident with who you are and others will respect you for that.|`|XKn14Qpjaa	I know you want a bf really bad and you wonder if something is wrong with you but actually i think you should build your character.  i mean dont try to be so much like everyone else.  different is better.  be very opinionated and when someone says anything u disagree with 'speak up'.  you will get noticed that way.|`|C3nx7Mvwaa	Maybe its your personality<br>  People might think your coincided or something like that|`|2AasREtfaa	Okay...it's definitely the shy thing. Guys are only gonna go for you if you're outgoing and easy to talk to. If you clam up every time you talk to somebody, especially a guy, you're not gonna come off as someone a person would want to be with. You have to make yourself fun to be around. The best advice i can give you is to go for a guy even if you don't completely like him. It is always an experience and something might grow out of nothing. just take some chances. Don't care what people think of you and then people will start thinking good things. Oh, and try to start hanging with a group that has guys in it. Best way to get a guy is to be their friend first! good luck!|`|TCjSJdDeaa	i had the same problem as you. i was a freshman two years and i felt sooo invisable. but then like outa no where all these guys started liking me. no joke just hanging in there and be your self. guys will come around eventually and notice you! i had my first boyfriend (and kiss my freshman year) and now im on my 3rd boyfriend! plus tons of other guys like me too!|`|bit5P4Dwaa	i am exactly like you!!!<br>  exactly!!!!<br>  and i'm sorry but i don't know i f i am normal!i like to think i am but thanks for posting this question so i can see how you get on.<br>  i just try not to think about it.<br>  you sound quite pretty but maybe its cos of your shyness!don't fret!i am shy too.as long as you have friends nothing else matters,right?|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	it sound like your actually a cute gal except that you dont know how to use it!!! i dont think that they dont noticed you, its probably because your facial expression send out a " leave me alone" vibes and also the fact that your shy!!! if they dont notice you make them notice you, start out by saying  hello/hi with a smile!!! if they say hi/hello or smile at you, smile back, let them come at you!!! dont act out pls.... if would look like your desperate!!! goodluck!!!|`|dRyifylCaa	Its probably because your shy "/<br>  I mean, Thats what it seems like..maybe you should try opening up a little..|`|pwiRMmicaa	thats how i feel!! i know exactly how you feel.<br>  but im sure someone does like you it's just that they're afriad to approach you. try being friends with guys more.|`|whR6j9JIaa	Maybe you're just not that fun to be around.
7Jm2ZZGzaa	i personally dont think theres anything wrong with it but, depending on what state the ppl live in, it could "technically" be illegal...from what ive heard the "age of consent" in most places is 16. im not sure what that means but it sounds like if its ok with the parents then its all good. i'd tell em just 2 be careful about it so no1 gets in trouble...especially him|`|XasLRQnXaa	thats disgusting|`|2TTAxrclaa	Well, I believe depending on the state or country you live in this may not be an issue per se. Nothing stops a 25 year old man from befriending a 16 year old woman. However, if it becomes a sexual relationship then it could become a serious legal issue. Different states and countries have different laws regarding what is the legal age for sexual consent for a minor and so depending on where you live that situation could be a strict no no at least from a legal perspective.<br>  <br>  Now from a social perspective, one wonders what a 25 year old man is doing with a 16 year old girl. They have not reached the same level of maturity, but I suppose to each his own.|`|q0NQStcXaa	That is perfectly... illegal.<br>  Don't.|`|D1KT9ioJaa	of course...its not like the kid is 10...now that would be gross...but 16 is straight...and remember age is nothing but a number|`|HOVvKqxsaa	it illegal<br>  if he touches you he can be arrested|`|8G0PhjlPaa	absolutley not and that is also illegal
01KVxwVOaa	When you met the girl you are meant to be with... you will no... good luck:)
Q3DfmT5Gaa	nope those signs suggest you cant be together no matter what sorry|`|vFldqvN4aa	yes they go well together : )
3RcMN0Ukaa	I'm like that too, so I just smile a lot to show them that I'm interested and like their presence. And it is somewhat awkward to talk to your bfs mom at first, so if she expected you to open up and becomes instant friends, she was wroongg.|`|2YmzqL1baa	Hey you are 16. Dont worry about it. I would just make some conversation. Ask how her day was and start with her. She also needs to talk to you. If you like this guy you need to impress him, believe me. You will be ok.|`|Io3jW3EEaa	im exactly like you im shy and i get nervous really fast why dont tell ure boyfriend to tell his mom to talk to you more and tht way you may have conversation and maybe the more she talks to you the more you feel comfortable|`|53ykpihwaa	find something in common if that doesn't work talk about the news|`|aY6EjDwjaa	the answer is SO SIMPLE<br>  it doesnt matter what his mum thinks of you.<br>  as long as he likes you its all good :D|`|cQaKjnyxaa	well hun<br>  <br>  dont worry im in the same boat but im just mommy hate bait. but anyways you can give up. the next time you are over his house go up to his mom and say "Sorry that you werent too soicalable the last time, cause i was nervous to meet you. i ddnt know what to say...."<br>  <br>  i know it might be alot to be alot to say, but once you say that you were nervous and stuf the mother aill totally understand and will lighten up such much and soon you will not be so nerous that you will have regular convs. and you feel so much better.|`|FsttwYe3aa	really moms never like a guys bf and just start a conversation it will take off from there
XasLRQnXaa	when i have to get on my knees to kiss them.|`|EWa7fzsCaa	I don't really have to worry about being too short because im taller than most guys i know, haha, but most people i know would say heaight wouldn't matter =P|`|KJxwNfsaaa	seriously?<br>  theres really no to short for girls.<br>  girls should be shorter then the guy.<br>  and when the guy is like a foot taller i think its cute.<br>  it just depends on the guy, cause every guy is different.<br>  but im sure most of them wont mind how short she is, well unless shes a midget then yeah
cFd00priaa	He's already noticed you're shy, and has commented on it. If you want to get to know him more, you cannot be shy about it. I promise you, if you have your friend tell him you like him, you will not get the response you want.<br>  <br>  In person, ask him if he wants to hang out some time. Be confident about it. Practice if you need to. But whatever you do, do it yourself, do not have a friend ask on your behalf.|`|6SP9YvDzaa	dont tell him you like him yet, get to know him. talk to him. joke around. show him that you are really nice once he gets to know you. not just a pretty girl thats shy lol.<br>  and if your worried about things going wrong, dont. its better to do something and for it to go wrong, than to not do it at all. Life is for living.<br>  <br>  you go girl!
XsUkn6B0aa	dont fall for any of it! the only reason girls with bf's flirt is cus they know its not gna go anywhere since theyre alread taken! and sometimes they dont even realize that theyre doing it! trust me....the flirting isnt going to go anywhere. sorry to say, but dont get your hopes up!|`|FeRC5jkoaa	When i want to let a guy know i like him i walk up to him and deck him right in the face|`|oYR6g5RSaa	yes its not right to do it but they do and if she seems like shes getting to close let her know or it could lead into other things|`|1CRbzkABaa	Dude she probably is interested bro girls cant help how they feel. If they have a bf there still looking for something better sometimes. Hehe there was a girl who sat next to me in my physics class. She was flirting and found out she was engaged, but hey here we are a month later and she spends her time with me a ditches her fiancee everyday. Dude id go for it cant hurt right? As long as you can defend yourself hehe.|`|hNKcAY7laa	if she flirts with you and she is with someone else she would do that to you to. she doesnt sound like a very nice person and if she was ever your girl friend you would never trust her. my advice is find someone who is just into you.|`|vFldqvN4aa	yes and most of the time no it doesnt mean anything (most of the time sorry : ( )|`|gLfqJwgqaa	well she probably likes you. you should talk to her about it.|`|XU1fftrMaa	Girls are gonna flirt. Some girls dnt because they wanna stay truly committed. Some girls flirt because they cnt help it what so ever. Like me for instance, I like to flirt.. alot! I try not to. I dnt touch him or anything. I just smile at him all the time but really I smile about everything! Lol<br>  But some people do it to be harmless and some people do it because it means something.
AjBpAPpdaa	It doesn't make much difference to me cos I'm british and I don't notice my accent, others will do tho. Maybe it's cos its very new to them and attractive and appealing in a sense. People often find other accents sexy, so ya know|`|61Wrl89Maa	Yea it's definitely a turn on.|`|0YS37jqgaa	Oh, yes.<br>  Very.|`|HN0Xd6keaa	Yes, it is incredibly sexy.|`|IGQw4267aa	YES.<br>  Espcially on oli sykes.<br>  <br>  mine por favor?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlygtJNO_oSzP7P8aG0DuE3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222102706AAXFucX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|JkC7nj7laa	i love british accents, and australian so yes!|`|f040b9a985ce599dfd0c5e07f7d2aaa7aa	I don't know about Australia, but American people (especially girls) just LOVE British accents.<br>  <br>  I don't know why though. It remains somewhat a mystery to me as a British boy. Guess I'll never quite know.|`|R4TeHZNUaa	Most American girls dig it big time. I think it's some connection with the whole 'Prince Charming' thing that was shoved down our throats as kids. lol|`|T4tVKZ5zaa	wow yes 18.. british.. good looking your the total package (;
ZCq2Y26waa	tell him that you dont deserve to be treated that way and if he keeps it up then just leave him when you get the money to. or, during sports, turn off all of the power in the house, take off clothes, get  in bed and call "honey come here" and make noises to make him get the idea that you want to play around. try doing that every once in a while and he might start liking u more than sports.
Y5WJWnvbaa	you have to remember that your boyfriend obviously likes you a lot, to want to be this intimate with you in the first place. <br>  <br>  i doubt many people think they will look very good in a compromising position, but you will look good to your boyfriend! try to stop thinking about what you think you look like, and just concentrate on the job in hand [no puns intended].<br>  <br>  if you relax, and try and enjoy what he looks like, and the things you can do for one-another, you will soon forget all about your own little niggles and insecurities, and just go with it!<br>  <br>  don't become a victim of 'lights out' syndrome!|`|dx9AZ16Paa	i have the same problem,<br>  and it led to us breaking up.<br>  i would just lay there like a dead tree and he would have to talk me into doing things.<br>  best of advice.<br>  When yall start kissing roll him over on his back and get on top of him.<br>  take his clothes off.<br>  take yours off.<br>  kiss him all over,<br>  and when you get down to sex then be LOUD AND ACT LIKE YOUR REALLY INTO IT.|`|dJoE8yedaa	It's all in the mind babe. If he didn't like you as you are, he wouldn't be with you. Try this, i'm a size 22 and i'm confident which makes another consider me sexy.<br>  Try walking around your home naked when you are alone. Accept that your body is the way it is and start to love yourself more. Sleep naked. You'll feel more sexy in yourself. Also, try learning your body. Feel yourself, even if you get excited. Buy adult toys and use them when you are alone. Eventually, you may find you won't mind using them with your partner. <br>  I wish you all the best. Anyone can be sexy.Keep telling yourself that and your confidence should grow.|`|FzyxiS4waa	well its fine you just have to be more secure with yourself......if he tells you your beautiful do you believe it?? and if your scared of how it might look with you taking control well that's fine unless  you guys are doing it in front of an audience....just take baby steps....push him down and get on top...or you can just press him against you w.e you decide|`|pT7mHBEVaa	jus go with the flow with the flow n make it look like he is giving u the time (in the bedroom) of your life
JERUmEFzaa	Tell your boyfriend so he can kick his bootie and block his number * Call your phone company*  Tell him to leave you alone! Say I hate you.. It may be mean but your the important one not him.|`|zMDkllJvaa	dont talk to him dont answer|`|3oUSroiZaa	Tell the guy to f*ck off.
M33rc7I0aa	She wanted to tease you a little bit but deep down she do have feelings for you keep doin wat u do and don't change your ways because yourself as you is making her like you even more.|`|A5wb4vXYaa	Sorry to break it to you but it kind of sounds like she was messing you around =/ okay so i don't actually know her, she might actually like you and want to make out, but it seems like it was some sort of inside joke between her and her friend...
omBvkpUXaa	Life is to grand to just end it. your parents love u so much that they don't want u to get hurt. but they love u a little to much. making friends is easy just say hi and say what u like and ask them what they like and if u have something in common then you can start a relationship from talking about the thing u too like. When u get older you can party like crazy and that will be fun. YOU BETTER NOT SUICIDE OR I WILL HAVE A BAD CONCHS THAT MY WORDS DIDN'T STOP U FROM KILLING YOURSELF
EdDLydH7aa	LOl, I never heard of that one, but I do know some females will pull silly stunts like that, but that ice is cold and hard, so she must really like yu to wipe out every time she passed you. That's sooooo funny, poor girl, all she had to do was say someting to you instead of getting bruises all over herself trying to get your attention. I think it's called the "damsel in distress" syndrome, also crying wolf could she could have been really hurt oneof those times...poor girl...i feel bad, but that is sooooo funny, i don't know why women pull this lilttle trick, but i've heard of worse....good luck|`|pwiRMmicaa	lmao thats kinda funny XD<br>  well i never done that b4 but im sure some guys like helping those types of girls cuz my friend fell one time near a boy and he came to help her but he was flirting with her too so my friend punched him and yelled at him lol<br>  weird.|`|a1xSsDryaa	The Star was an accident but your welcome|`|JkC7nj7laa	its for shallow ppl|`|J9sUlpX8aa	She kept tripping over your ego, apparently|`|rxmubcdwaa	many girls do this all their trying to do is get your attention[:|`|gywXHuGCaa	i wish i had more ice skating rinks... it's 35oC in the sun...|`|0YS37jqgaa	That's stupid, and I laughed when you left her there.<br>  That's hilarious!<br>  <br>  I've fallen ice skating, but not on purpose, it hurts and it's cold!<br>  My nice bf tried to help me up, but fell over too lol.|`|o3d3NBVzaa	Lol. I'm not a lady, but I recently took a girl I like ice skating, just to have an excuse to touch her.<br>  <br>  And it worked.
qXjw8acUaa	this dude is innocent as hell, in fact all he's doing is all he knows how to do and that's ANYTHING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION...it's flattery at it's worst..the reason i say worst is because although he's attempting to flatter you and show you that he's "paying attention" to you he's diong it in such a way that could push you away and even wonder if he's a stalker like you put it...but honestly...talk to him, get to know him a bit and then you can get comfortable enough with him to let him know that him making those comments was actually a bit creepy but flattering at the same time and he can laugh at himself and who knows, if you think he is cute then maybe he's got a good personality as well...so if you don't have a booming love life right now, explore this option and see where it takes you!|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	he has made the effort to know and extract information from you friend.  he likes you.  his friend is one of the main sources of information.  this is his attempt at being "mysterious"|`|3llK5y7Baa	i have had stalkers and its annoying, disguisting and pathetic! i think you already know he is a stalker...so tell him tell bakc off|`|obXAeNW5aa	my honest answer talk to the Dean of the school or the principal witch ever is the case. I also think that your parents should be informed to whats going on just to be on the safe side .|`|v2rhWswRaa	hes obviously keeping tabs on you<br>  kinda stalkerish.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	don't tell his friend any of your private info.  tell his friend you're concerned, maybe not in a good way, about his behavior.|`|oaVhxc8caa	Call the cops!!! <br>  That is so creepy!!!!|`|zGFiWSPtaa	That's kinda weird, but Im not sure he's a stalker, maybe he just talks to your friends. A stalker is somebody who follows you around, invades your privacy and makes you feel uncomfortable a lot. A guy who likes you simply has an interest in you and maybe talks to you and would jump at an opportunity to hang out with you, yet you don't find him everywhere you go and you can go where you want without feeling watched. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|c7Vz0JtGaa	!!! That is really strange! I had the same thing happen to me. Just tell him it freaks you out and to stop it! that's what i did and he stopped right away.<br>  I mean the guy that was stalking me knew my address and everything and i have never talked to him before. so comfront him about it before it goes too far!<br>  hopes this helps!<br>  -Sabrina|`|JNCpyyYZaa	thats bizarre, i'd stay clear sounds like a psycho<br>  <br>  help <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222134750AA7oGP5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|cezaZQQsaa	he's probably not a stalker, but he does seem really desperate for your attention. maybe he likes u and doesnt know any other way to approach u? try talking to him sometime|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It does seem a little strange but if it bothers you then tell him how you feel. He may of just heard somethings from other people.|`|R9ikVxzRaa	yeah, he's obsessed...|`|s7us9819aa	That definately screams stalker to me.. I would stay away from him if I were you, and tell your teacher or parents.. he seems psycho you don't want it to turn into anything more serious.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think he might have an interest in you and has found things out by possibly overhearing something that had to do with you and he probably figured out that these were your friends. It is pretty creepy for someone to know what you have talked about outside of class but I think he had to have gotten that info from someone. If you start to see things like him following either you or your friends around and it makes you nervous, talk to a teacher about it and they can put him in a different class or have a talk with him . A guy who likes you will try to talk to you or flirt with you or tease you. But a stalker will find info out about you without you knowing and maybe follow you around and find out where you like to go and end up being there. You really need to pay attention to this because this world is full of crazies. Not to scare you but I am just telling you to be on your guard and stick with your friends as much as possible. You can always go online and look up definitions of stalking if you don't get much out of this and it can give you more information on what they do and what their motives are. Just be careful:)|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	well, i think he likes you but hes shy or doesnt know what/how to tell you thats why hes trying to get your attention!!!! you should try to talk to but with your friends though just in case!!! btw a STALKER could be a guy who likes you or creepy ones who has different intentions!!!! hes pretty much a stalker who likes you!!|`|goIO1hJnaa	Well you can confront him about it and see his reaction,|`|JivLAZH6aa	Tell a teacher or your parents.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|TBd8B96Haa	you dont want to over react i am pretty sure he is not a stalker but he just likes you...he probably asks your freinds about you and etc.|`|EDYETUNCaa	Well it kinda depends. I am sure that if you really liked this guy you'd probably find it cool and enduring that he knows things about you. You'd also assume he'd heard it from other people or asked mutual friends. But since you two don't have friends in common and he knows things about ... that's where it's creepy. Especially since you don't have romantic feelings toward him. <br>  <br>  Just ignore him in class. And don't talk to him except unless you have too. He polite, but curt, don't even glance his way and if you do look away. Hopefully he'll get the hint that you don't want to talk to him. But if he gets more persistent and creepy, that's when you have to tell someone - like your teacher from the class, a close friend, a parent.
ajaZr8Axaa	Had one once and wasn't that into it because I wasn't emotionally involved...then *he* up and decided he was interested in a relationship, started calling me every day...I couldn't deal with it.  It's not something I would recommend or ever intend to attempt again.|`|6PMGheWxaa	i had one when me and my ex broke up. we had a cooling off period, and then we were still friends. neither of us had moved on so we got together once a week or once every two weeks. it was fun cuz i still liked him, but we didnt wanna be together anymore, so y not just keep doin it? lol<br>  <br>  then it ended and i found the love of my life :)|`|MwHxyNogaa	Had one.

YsiJiOqXaa	Make sure you shop around! I was going to rent from this place that wanted $13 per table. I shopped around and got them for $3.75 pre table. You can try online too. Usually party stores can rent them out too. I went to a small party store in my area and found the best price and they are just as good as the $13 ones.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	If you buy from the right place, you can buy them for cheaper than renting them.  www.tableclothsfactory.com - you could buy them, use them, and then you could sell them on ebay or craigslist if you didn't want to keep them.

4m9Hewq1aa	Yes, most definitely.<br>  I have never been in love before but I feel love is only a matter of waiting. Time is such an awful thing but I know eventually I will find my true love and everthing will simply fall into place. I have found someone very special to me (though he is in love with a girl who is not available). Once more it is only a matter of time, he will either realize how much I care for him and love me or I will learn from this experience and travel down my destined path to find love. Either way I wish for his happiness and I respect him far too much to tell him how I feel when he cares for this girl so deeply. It is only a matter of time to find love...it's just the waiting that is difficult. -Alice (16f)|`|AA11324847	I believe love is a myth that only leads to pain for someone. All I believe in is friendship and trust and companionship, I make a point not to love a girl until I know the REAL her. And that pursuit seems to take longer and longer the older I get.|`|x1UrTbjnaa	I do believe there is love in this world. I think too many people are hurrying getting married or having kids. Not because of love but what is expected, or because little girls fall for little boys instead of actually getting to know them for thee batter or worst. For example my sister lived with her bf for 2-3 yrs, now in my eyes this is not far enough to know someone, never actually seeing his bad till a year after they were married and had a little girl. Now, my niece is being brought up with no father and a abusive mother. Is this any of her fault they fell apart? <br>  <br>  No. Love is there but it's not half as easy as the honeymooners make it look
sE6McoGLaa	The answer you are deserving would be speculation without knowing you but the general answer for most of us who ask the same thing is People want what they cant have.You see its the human psyche.The way to get him back in your life if he is worthy is making him jealous.see we are jealous creatures women more so than men.This can be done many ways and Id use em all to your advantage.A stop calling him.B no texting I LOVE YOU etc. C tell him that hes right its over and for the better.He can have you anytime so dont let him know that anymore act like you dont care..D Change your look new hair color new make up sexy sexy yourself up.E Make him feel less way less important to you by being out there in the dating field of play and more imporantly vision.If he sees other men having a interest in you good!But you cant be letting him know at all at all at all this is your angle! Make him wanting you is easy but do it incandescently make him jealous but dont let him know this is your angle.F play the field guys love girls guys dont love other guys with their x s and if your really want to screw with him start talking and flirting with his friends etc..Guys will always choose women over friendships with men.MEN WANT WHAT THEY CANT HAVE!If he thinks he cant have you hell want you esp with the info I suggested K.Have a great one.|`|ds1rf8efaa	This is my exact case.<br>  You have to realize that the guy you were previously with will not necessarily be the guy you should be with now.<br>  My friend explained it like this:<br>  Life is a series of stepping stones. Some are VERY wobbly, some are stable. He was a very stable stone. And once you stepped forward, you realized things ahead are wobbly. Sometimes, you miss the more secure stone. But you have to know an even MORE secure one is ahead.|`|zGthY1Jeaa	Well I was in an exact case like urs. My ex broke up with me 4 months ago, n I was still in love wit him even though it was a month later. <br>  I wud burst into tears whenever I saw him, I cried almost every day.I missed him like crazy. n worse yet he treated me like crap. But I eventually moved on. How?<br>  I started occupying my time with activities n ppl that shut out his existence. U need to forget him, or ull hurt urself more dan he is you. And start dating Itll help trust me ;-) gud luk!!|`|oCaf3238aa	becuse you were in love and just arent over him yet.|`|kf0mm5eGaa	A lot of times it's because you're in love with the memories, the good times. A lot of people only see the good times in a relationship after it's over which is completely normal. Time will heal it eventually, if it's meant to be it will happen. You should try to get some closure, maybe have a girls night out to cheer you up?|`|jwvXO7n2aa	I'm in the exact same situation.<br>  Go read my question if you want the whole storyy.<br>  But , I think its because you sit there<br>  and dwell on eveyrhting you had<br>  and think about it<br>  atleast thats what i do<br>  im not one to give advice<br>  but what everyone is telling me is that<br>  hes not worth your time<br>  dont give him the satisfaction<br>  youll find someone better<br>  just give it time<br>  try not to think about it<br>  focus on your friends<br>  dont dwelll on the past<br>  and hold your head up high<br>  [:|`|CVvYhEfGaa	its not him that you miss, its what you had. its normal to miss someone you loved. im in that very same situation. dont worry about it too much, your heart just needs a little time. but you wont heal on your own, you need to actually TRY to move on. things will get better in time.|`|crbzVL0Haa	It's normal. You probably just want closure or something.<br>  <br>  So get over it. MOVE ON. You will love again.<br>  <br>  I promise.|`|d72d9b4ee7bc5e8af5569705dad9c23baa	because ur not over him|`|fC8OPOTkaa	it must be love, love, love, nothing more nothing less.<br>  <br>  :) X|`|a1xSsDryaa	Everbody will feel like it at some point. its natural.
v7GH7ulgaa	love is a powerful emotion. i think that some people just don't understand the meaning of "love".  it's just a word to them. it has no meaning. they probobly have never been taught what love is. <br>  <br>  its' just my opinion. people can think whatever they want.|`|HoZYr3bXaa	I see where you're going, with everyone saying that they love someone, and we don't know if they mean it or not.<br>  However, I really think I am :P, although I do agree with you. You could consider me just one of 'them', and I wouldn't blame you.<br>  Lenalove, girl, chill!|`|wh3BAc4taa	Love is a strong emotion. There isn't an age limit to when a person falls in love. When it happens, it happens.|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	yeah..i see kids after 2 weeks of going out at my school and they say they love them..i think they use it just to say they really like them..but then when they really love them they are gonna have to find something els to say|`|DSNHIe40aa	They are at the age when they first start to feel how strong the emotion is.  I think most teens (especially younger ones) are infatuated more than in love, but they haven't experienced a serious relationship yet.  With every new person a teenager likes as time goes by, they start to feel stronger and stronger feelings toward these people.  They mean what they say when they claim to love someone, because each time it's the strongest love they've felt.  When they grow up, they will understand better, but I do believe that teenagers are capable of being in love, just probably not to the extent of adults who are around 30.|`|1FKQryQzaa	i disagree with you<br>  whos says with age comes love<br>  ik i love my boyfriend<br>  and why should age determine when<br>  i can love him and when i cant<br>  ive been dateing him for over a yr<br>  and sat here bawling and writeing him<br>  letters threw his basic training and<br>  aip for army. and we r still going strong<br>  look at elders most of them are very much in<br>  love and they got married when they were<br>  around 16. its a matter of finding<br>  the right person for you and who says you cant find them now<br>  seriously you asked for opnions then complained when someone<br>  gave theirs. ill agree with you in some ways. teens saying they love someone<br>  after 1 day is anoying.  but i waited a great deal and didnt even say it first. i waited<br>  for him to say it so i knew he ment it. and i was the first person<br>  he ever said it to <br>  -Q|`|18560CRXaa	yah, lenalove... that was uncalled for, Savetrees was just asking for opinons. i totally 100% agree with SaveTrees|`|qWIha03Iaa	Well, I think you can have love and care for just about anyone. Your family, friends, significant other, acquaintances, people you hardly know, pets, etc. Lol <br>  <br>  But, perhaps you are referring more to 'falling in love' or becoming 'obsessed' with that person, which I understand where you are coming from.|`|KGOxYkh7aa	most of it is infatuation. but dont underestimate teenage love. its just different , love can be all kinds of things :]
k0Ewe7mCaa	Be yourself. Girls don't want guys who try to be a cool jock or something. Be normal and the girls should come flocking in.|`|qc1fasaeaa	You have to be yourself, and if she doesn't like that then it isn't meant to be. There are some things you can do to make yourself more approachable. Just be nice, have good hygiene, and try not to come across as too cocky. Most girls like confident guys, but not cocky.|`|Gza8jaboaa	good personallity...<br>  niice<br>  attractive<br>  corney cute is always good..<br>  keep a conversation...<br>  stuff like that :]
le9a9R4waa	Just tell her you don't want her to go, the time changed.
HzkDjDpyaa	Just like it was when i was in my 20's, although the women are slightly fatter and more desperate.|`|qOufCWtnaa	I am in my early 30's and its tough. Alot of people i find are divorced w/kids and may not want to be married again. Some want to play the field and not want a committment. Its hard. I joined myspace and facebook and have met some nice people on there..some of which i dated, but alot of them were still hung up on the x's. Good luck|`|AA10847497	You will find people have more baggage and history in their 30's but then that should not put you off.  Just relax and have fun with people!!!|`|9mQC5Vihaa	Bombed out and depleted, just like Afghanistan.|`|cxzQVRYiaa	Yahoo Answers is the early 30's dating scene.<br>  <br>  A/S/L?|`|6jNrWbAZaa	It suxs now adays you have to lower your standards.|`|eUf9e81eaa	The dating scene is tending towards marriage.
XEJD4mLWaa	Probably because you did it behind her back. If she was there would you had said yes to the other stripper. In a way it's kind of betraying her but unofficially if you know what I mean. Also, although your not dating her doesn't mean that you don't have feelings for her and when you have feelings for someone you don't want to hurt them. And the thought of her finding out and getting hurt is the reason behind the guilt.<br>  <br>  That's just what I think.|`|QM7cAE4vaa	You feel like you did something wrong, thus the guilt.  The reason you feel you did something wrong probably is that you must have some real feelings for her.  you know, subconsciously at least, that you really don't need or want to be touching anyone else.  you want to pursue this with the waitress.|`|NBnOhmOiaa	idk?|`|NvgowkZzaa	You have developed feelings for this girl. You like her, and you are keeping something from her that if you tell her you feel that it could jeopardize your relationship with her. If you really liked this girl, I would ditch the stripper, and be fully committed to the girl you like.<br>  <br>  I definitely agree with crazyboutthisboy! She is right. You need to both get out of that environment if you want your relationship to truly work!|`|MGfFDZnLaa	you probably feel guilty because you really like that waitress. <br>  <br>  advice: one of these days, before its too late, you should tell the waitress what happened. because one of these days, shes bound to find out--and if you guys DO get together, if she finds out that youve been hiding something from her, she might have second thoughts.|`|o55k9RVVaa	i think you feel guilty because you really like the waitress and you want something to happen between you guys. so try and make things work with the waitress and not the stripper.|`|7VBdPtIQaa	I use to work in a strip club as a waitress. Some strippers and some waitresses are the most scandalous people out there. It's a shady lifestyle. If you want to have a lasting relationship with this girl then both of your need to remove yourselves from the negative environment.|`|d9xIDrySaa	Because you had sincere feelings for her and you care about what she thinks?? You know what you did was wrong, so you're gonna lament about it. <br>  Try to put it out of your mind. It wont help to do anything else that might be wrong. <br>  ANSWER MINE plz =]] <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoWzTR25YqzRGEpJJpfnjzDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221144225AAUg8bH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rJkgtZ3Paa	You live a very dirty life style I will make sure you hump as many men as possible!|`|RVlkauBRaa	Most guys dont feel guilty, so consider it a gift lol...
0FrJy2NEaa	Watch episode 110 of South Park and you will see more clearly.
kUE3Ddktaa	Don't listen to the people doubting your relationship. Some couples just argue like this - both people have strong opinions and strong personalities. Arguing is only bad for a relationship if it becomes hurtful - if it's always about beating the other person, instead of getting your opinion heard, or if you use past arguments to wound the other one (in an "I told you so" kind of way). The kind of arguing you're talking about can be good, because it means you're communicating with each other.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the wedding thing is going to be just like the house thing. You're going to have to hammer out a plan that both of you can live with, keeping in mind the strictures of reality. You can't just mail in a form and be married - you have to go somewhere, say some vows, and sign the paper. So, with that in mind, you and your fiance are just going to have to argue about it until you both find a compromise you can live with. Maybe that means a simple courthouse wedding for you followed by a dinner with close family and friends at a nice restaurant for him. <br>  <br>  I've never met a couple that hasn't gotten frustrated with each other during the planning phase. But they get through it because the reward at the end is worth it - they get to make a formal public commitment to the person that they love (and reap the tax benefits as well!).<br>  <br>  Keep this in mind - you've agreed on the really important thing, that you want to marry each other. The rest of it is just details, and there's no right or wrong solution. You just need to figure out what will work for your relationship, and you both need to be willing to make some compromises.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	We argue over everything as well (except the wedding funnily enough) and it is because I'm always right and he is wrong! (joking). However everything else is stressful, the house part especially! <br>  I think it is just the way it is when you are comfortable enough with a person that you don't spend every second trying to be perfect and not annoy them (like when you first got together).<br>  Don't get discouraged, keep bringing things up in a nice way and eventually it will be planned.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Didn't have much of a problem as my husband didn't have an opinion on much. His only concern was that I would stand up to my mom and get the dress I wanted instead of what she wanted me to. He also had an opinion on a few other things that I let him have just because he didn't insist on much. If you want to give planning another try, I would start by looking at things separately, making a list of things you like and would like and then compare them to see if there is anything, anything at all you agree on or come close to. Trade lists and cross off the things you absolutely could not, ever ever live with and star at least three you like. Then keep compromising from their, relationships are about compromise he likes navy and yellow for colours and you like navy and cream go with yellow and cream. He wants a square cake and you want a round one, have one round tier and one square one. He wants an outdoor wedding you want a church wedding, have it on the lawn of your church. There's all sorts of ways to work together so you are only partially unhappy:)|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Uh if you guys cant get along over this, maybe you arent ready to get married. There is no way i would want to marry someone i argued this much with. I was in 2 long term relationships where we argued every now and then and i thought it was normal, but it wasnt until i started dating my fiance that i realized that couples shouldnt argue like that. It is ok to disagree, but if an argument comes out of it, its not right. Normally the man just goes "whatever you want honey" when it comes to weddings.  Opposite people are supposed to compliment each other, not cause arguments over it. A marriage is about compromising and if you cant do it over something that in the long run isnt that big of a deal, who knows what will happen when it comes to things that really impact your life. I'm not trying to be rude, it just doesnt seem like a good fit and i dont want you guys to end up in divorce in a couple years!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	What about a compromise? A small ceremony (just parents, siblings and best friends) in a backyard somewhere.  It gives him the ceremony he wants and gives you the elopement style wedding you want.<br>  <br>  Or what about inviting everyone to Mexico or something and do it on a nice beach there? (don't worry, they pay for their own flights and stuff, not you lol)|`|oXfvBdNHaa	You sound very similar to my fiance and I! Just learn to compromise. Waking up next to him every day will be worth it. Decide if a ceremony is even worth it. If not, just go ti the courthouse and have a get together celebrating your marriage, and spend the money on a honeymoon!!|`|1M90Aoytaa	Are you sure you love this guy? planning a wedding can be frustrating but me and my fiance agree on almost everything or we comprimise - if you cannot comprimise how can you live together as a happily married couple. <br>  why dont you elope or have over seas wedding on a beach with just 2 of you? yes youl have to say your vows where ever you go and im a bit shocked you wouldnt want to actually say vows?! <br>  <br>  you need to consider if you marriage is going to work if you never agree on anything, will yoou just get frustrated and split up in 5, 10, 15 years of arguing? <br>  <br>  personally i find wedding planning good fun and i love talking about it with my h2b, i dont want to sound liek we have the perfect relationship, its not without disagreements but we dont fight and we always comprimise on some solution fairly quickly|`|GMtoiRRmaa	probably my wife can answer this one better ah ha. but there is a point in every woman's wife where they want to call of the wedding. Its stressful yes! no doubt about that. My wife at one time wanted to call off the wedding to. So did my mom with my dad at one time.<br>  <br>  It's a perfectly normal thing to happen. but at the end it was worth it
kUE3Ddktaa	The officiant will say "Do you blah blah blah" and you have to verbally consent "I do" or "Yes" or whatever to show that you are entering the marriage of your own free will. You don't have to repeat the long vows or make a speech or anything, but you do have to hear the vow and then consent. Takes five minutes - easiest thing in the world.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I know a few people who got married at the courthouse in a few different states around the US, and they were expected to still take vows and participate in a short ceremony.  They didn't need to have anybody other than the witnesses there though.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	All you need for courthouse is the license, bride and groom and 2 witnesses.<br>  A judge or JOP will ask you "do you take this man/woman...." and you have to say "yes" or "I do". Certain vows must be spoken out loud to make a marriage legal.<br>  This takes only about 10-15 minutes though.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No you can't just sign a paper and be done with it. In many states, (if not all) it's not considered legal unless you exchange vows. If all either of you want to say is "I do", that shouldn't be a problem with the judge.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You'll have to look into it. All that's required to be legally married is a marriage license, officiant, and two witnesses to sign the marriage license (other than bride, groom and officiant).|`|JMJsCU1vaa	you can be married simply by a notary public...|`|AA10451854	Only in Las Vegas can you get married without having a ceremony. Elsewhere, it's strictly mandatory to hold a marriage ceremony at a church or some small chapel and then sign the papers to officially declare your marriage.|`|1M90Aoytaa	Even a registar office you have to say vows, why wouldnt you want to??<br>  <br>  he marriage ceremony begins with a welcome and introduction by the Superintendent registrar. There is no provision in a civil ceremony for you to actually be 'given away' but some individual registrars may allow it to be included at this point. You will then repeat the civil marriage declarations and you have a choice of three versions:<br>  <br>     1. "I do solemnly declare that I know not of any lawful impediment why I, Jonathan Michael, may not be joined in matrimony to Jacqueline Ann."<br>     2. "I declare that I know legal reason why I, Jonathan Michael, may not be joined in marriage to Jacqueline Ann."<br>     3. Or by replying, "I am", to the question: 'Are you Jonathan Michael free lawfully to marry Jacqueline Ann?'<br>  <br>  This is followed by your Contracting Words, chosen from the following:<br>  <br>     1. "I call upon these persons here present to witness that I take thee, Jonathan Michael, to be my lawful wedded husband."<br>     2. "I, Jonathan Michael, take you, Jacqueline Ann, to be my lawful wedded wife."<br>     3. "I, Jonathan Michael, take thee, Jacqueline Ann, to be my wedded wife/husband."<br>  <br>  Rings are usually exchanged at this point and you can choose from some optional vows below, or even add some of your own.<br>  <br>     1. "Jacqueline Ann/ Jonathan Michael, I give you this ring, as a token of my love, and a symbol of our marriage."<br>     2. "Jacqueline Ann/Jonathan Michael, I give you this ring, as a token of my love, and a symbol of our marriage, I vow to be loving, faithful and loyal to you, in living our married life together."<br>     3. "Jacqueline Ann/ Jonathan Michael as I take you to be my wife/husband, I promise to love you, honour and respect you. I will stand by you and be true to you always. I will care for you, laugh with you when you are happy, comfort you when you are sad. Whatever life may bring I will always love you."<br>  <br>  At this point, you may like to include a reading or a poem recited by one of your guests or even a song sung by a soloist or your guests. These, of course, will have to be agreed with the registrar before the day. You will probably have to provide your own music as well, however, the register office should have a music system you can use.<br>  <br>  Once the ceremony has ended, you and two witnesses sign the register and you can play a piece of music to entertain your guests. Again, you can either choose something meaningful to you or the registrar will play something appropriate.|`|8ngDDwhVaa	i supose if you went to Vegas...
qmE1cIQbaa	but of course! How else is a person suppose to start out?  As long as you feel comfortable with the person. Always trust your instincts when hiring a planner. <br>  Good luck!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	For free, I MAY ask for help on a few things but I'm not one who want/hire a wedding planner at all, no matter what the price.  I want the experience of planning my own, but that's just me.|`|ZEYkDuxCaa	Well, I would hire one with out experience.  And the reason why is everyone starts out doing something with no experience. Just keep in touch with her, tell what your and your future husband likes and dis-likes.  And be sure to give her a list, view all details before she hires.|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	No, I wouldn't. That isn't really experience. You can't learn what you need to learn from an online course. I have a friend who has been planning weddings for over 10 years. She was working for someone else all those years, and just opened her own business. Her business is new but her experience is not. That is the kind of new that would be acceptable. You need someone who knows local vendors and has contacts.|`|AA10928125	Most people don't just take up wedding planning as a hobby. When I got married I got a half price deal on a bakery,because they had just opened and they knew my wedding would give them alot of publicity.<br>  It turned out fantastico! I would get the number of that one wedding and talk to the bride or mom about how they did on it.<br>    Free is the best deal! Just be sure she knows you are in charge,she doesn't just plan it the way she wants it...it's your wedding,you are in charge...good luck!|`|1M90Aoytaa	im not havong a wedding planner either - i dont think id trust someone who wanted to do it for free, id wonder why a  stranger wanted to be involved in my wedding, if i was you id get work expereince wit ha real wedding planner - prehaps shadow one for a while and do some real training not online courses...online courses have no credability.|`|bJ3WlzoBaa	if he/she had good examples of how he/she would plan a wedding i would let her/him plan my wedding to get experience.

fL8QIhfyaa	it's great that you are athletic but a lot of girls might steer clear because it usually indicates you want some flawless flat stomach girl so you are limiting your chances. My husband is super buff and it just annoys me now because he is way too into appearances, sometimes you just need to grow up! Make it more fun and warm :)<br>  Do you have a dog? Like animals? where have you travelled? what would you do on a first date? whats your bad habit? make them feel more comfortable!! :)<br>  <br>  aw, sorry to hear that :( maybe get a puppy then, women love puppies and then you won't even need a online profile lol go to the dog park :) i am currently married to a guy i met online and we are separating, i NEVER doing the online thing again, hope you have better luck!!

KLGtR4vqaa	ahhh thats like one of the worst situations to be in!!<br>  I wouldn't make a move just yet seeing as its only been a week with the new guy and he might take it as your on the rebound from the old one although your definatly not or he might think you finished things with the other one for him which he could take in a good way or a bad way, so leave it a little while but keep stayin in contact and hopefully things will work out..maybe you should go for a drink or something along them lines coz then you could be making a move or it could be friendly!!<br>  hope this helps somehow

pgKYXG5eaa	he probably REALLY likes you|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Is this a question or a dissertation?|`|TsoXZKSyaa	He doesn't have a girlfriend (but if he does he's kinda a player) but I'm pretty sure he definately does not. You should ask him about it, just be like..."so, what school does your girlfriend go to?" and then see what he says :).<br>  <br>  He does like you, but there could be alot of reasons why he hasn't asked you out yet. Alot of guys are shy about it and maybe he doesn't want to mess up what he has with you right now, he likes flirting with you and chatting with you and if you say "no" then he won't be able to do that anymore, things will change. <br>  <br>  If you want him to ask you out you should flirt back with him, and pay attention to him like he does to  you, let him know you are interested, and work on strengthing your friendship. Eventually something will happen, don't worry ;), the longer you wait the better it is, because the more you know eachother etc. :)<br>  <br>  good luck!! :)|`|prjXvpL8aa	he OBVIOUSLY likes you|`|AA11538827	you shouldnt even have to ask. look at the facts!<br>  his friends say he likes you.<br>  he flirts.<br>  he turned down ur friend while he was single.<br>  he touches you (big hint)<br>  <br>  he likes you.<br>  ask him out. for example:<br>  invite him to a movie you wanna see.<br>  <br>  say something like, "hey, i really want to see -------, but i dont have anyone to go with. Do you wanna come with me on friday/saturday night?"|`|UBGSFW7maa	say you have a question but you don't have time to tell it to him but here is your number<br>  <br>  ask something like if you could study together<br>  <br>  or ask him a hw question|`|kDyj5d7laa	Okay well the boy obviously likes you! And if you don't want anything to be awkward, try this, it worked for me.<br>  Ask a bunch of your friends, guys and girls, and this guy Jake and go bowling.

Some guys are too shy to make the first move... how about you surprise him by simply asking him to see his cell phone and saving your phone number is his phone.

Your not gonna die if he say no so why not?|`|yVONmPUuaa	Ask him to hang out sometime. I mean he might just be chickening out on asking you out. You never know but just take the risk. Ask him out.

PEMnzRnvaa	sex|`|5rXzu0IWaa	I am 51 scarletem and I still think about Debbie Sevarese my first kiss and Lori Horton my first romance and every woman and girl ever since. I still love my only wife though.|`|whR6j9JIaa	Depends on how hot the ex was, and how amicable the break-up was.|`|6ZaNn3kQaa	I sometimes think of good times I had with the girl, and then sometimes if I think of the relationship's downfall and if it was based on my mistakes, I tend to wish to call the girl and apologize. If I ever went back to a girl, it would be because I would be confident that I could change things for the better again.|`|AA11923213	because they are stupidd!<br>  aha jk <br>  but i dont really know. some guys have different reasons.<br>  <br>  some just use their ex's<br>  and some just reliazed they've made a huge mistake and decide to go back.
lbmFZkDSaa	take this as a chance to see him.<br>  talk ...ask how he's been doing, etc.<br>  i wouldn't push it though unless you <br>  know that he still feels the same for you.<br>  but other than that, if you two are still <br>  okay friends then just talk to him.
4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Tell him you got it fixed but still want him to come over and hang out.  Don't make up stories just to see him cause when he finds out he's gonna think that's lame and not wanna hang out with you again in the future.
TthDWtPTaa	break the radio again

(;
goIO1hJnaa	well if he's said it than go ahead or just say it kind of jokingly like if he gets you your favortie candy bar you laugh and say you'll love him forever if he keeps it up, people in highschool say i love you all the time, but i think as we mature it becomes moremeaningful and people don't throw it around the same!
XH2o1MM6aa	.I'm sure all the reasons stated (1-2 & 3) are true.Does'nt mean you can't enjoy the prom.Making him jealous does'nt mean wanting him back.She might in fact be boasting to him about her "catch".While he's stuck with the town tart.|`|TthDWtPTaa	she's a beyotch, thats her motive
KPXwwwMMaa	Well, firstly, I'd stop calling him your 'BFF'. He probably just wants to act more adult-ish now, and feels you're holding him back. Adults don't call each other 'BFF' and they don't tell each other 'secrets'.
dItZAwI2aa	truthfulness, honesty, respect, love, companionship...i lived up to it, neither of my ex wives did...and by the number of thumbs downs i get when i answer these things on YA!, evidentally they are not acceptable or achievable anymore in marriage.<br>  <br>  good luck and GOD bless.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Top 5 things I like:<br>  1.  supportive (as far as my dreams, hopes, etc.)<br>  2.  humor<br>  3.  chivalry<br>  4.  affectionate<br>  5.  smart enough to follow his own dreams as well<br>  <br>  Top 5 I don't like:<br>  1.  bragging about himself<br>  2.  him having to be center of attention<br>  3.  anger<br>  4.  "womanizer" habits<br>  5.   can't think of a last one!<br>  <br>  I think I live up to it.. and my husband is pretty damn amazing!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	being honest, caring, loving, open about things, someone that you are compatible with, that likes doing what you do and more and same with him but both are willing to try to do or learn more things.<br>  top 5 honest, caring, open, humor, looks<br>  things that would make me run away is not being honest about what you feel, or open about things what you like or dont like. willing to talk to me face to face not text or emails.<br>  I live up to these but havent found anyone that can do the same|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	well of course it's Honesty, loyalty, respect and ect.. But my biggest thing is a man that isn't one of those who lives off of their woman and has a job, cleans up after them self and takes responsiblity for their actions and I also don't go for men who are still living at home with their mommy at age 21 either. But I kinda married a man that sometimes cleans up after himself and sits around the house all day if he isn't working. which is kinda irritating but I will deal LOL!!!|`|jMLa696Taa	Ahhhhh...love takes it all, you don't have to live with the expectation. If you love someone, that just it, you don't care much, you forgive, you love, you trust, you care, you understands.....LOVE....IS ENOUGH!!!|`|nowngQiPaa	trust, loyalty, respect, trust, trust<br>  <br>  i live up to it,he didn.t
YTmp3ODCaa	okkk , text him & be like " happpy birthday ! (:"<br>  <br>  im sure he wouldnt find it weird, cause i mean he said that he wanted to be friends. & thats a friend thing to do. just sending him a simple text could make yall become closer . <br>  <br>  gooodluck sweetie ( ;|`|nETw4eOKaa	well me and my ex had been broke up for a month and he was dating someone else and<br>  i texted him and said Happy Birthday Boy!<br>  and he texted back and said thanks.<br>  i was so scared to do it,<br>  but it all worked out.<br>  go for it.
uLHtXibRaa	I dont understand why she would do that unless she enjoys humiliating  guys and thats worrying....no ive never done that..ive only ever slapped a man if he has put his hand somewhere were i dont want him to..
zzaScg0haa	It would cost him money yes, and it is just a week or two, calm down
VZVGXRyraa	I wouldn't risk it. Do you really want to risk throwing your 2 year relationship away on a stupid threesome that'll most likely make things awkward afterwards?<br>  <br>  Just tell your girlfriend that you're no longer interested...that she's all the girl you need. She'll like it, especially if she's the jealous type.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	You are playing with fire. It will backfire and bite you in the a$$|`|vBqIRHppaa	sit your girlfriend down and talk about it.<br>  on a personal level,ask her how she feels about this and tell her how you feel about it.<br>  dont play guessing games and try to figure out whats going to happen and how she feels,that will end up a disaster.<br>  TALK TO HER ABOUT IT <3<br>  Good luck|`|psn7Prigaa	Either it's a trap, or your girl is bi-curious.
ZRG7wEf9aa	So your saying that she has a problem in not understanding English culture.  Well big deal.  Why don't you, being the more intelligent one, delve into her cultural interests and create fun that appeals to her.  Your relationship limits are only in your ability to think outside the British box.|`|ASJlcmTgaa	I believe it can work as there is much they can do to have fun - running, walks, cinema, jsut spending time together, bowling, ice skating etc.  She must have so much diversity to give in the realtionship too.  Its not down to being smart, its generally the diversity of the culture.  Relationships are about bonding, communication, love, sacrafices and compromises.  I dont see why it couldnt work.|`|9dTA2Ariaa	it can work well as long as the smart man doesnt think hes better than her, or he doesnt take advantage like telling crafty lies in order to cheat. he has to help her make her life easier by helping her with the things that are hard for her.|`|b9fae45b6e9e49f9e502d412e0c0ae32aa	stupid boy. <br>  teach her the english culture. <br>  I think you already won't work because you're being a bit of a jerk.|`|6JEgauSdaa	love is wierd, you cant say when or when it will or wont work, its love! let happen
4312092055b1be3e34496844790fe604aa	Sadly, I should not imagine so mate. The attraction you talk about is the first stage of a series of events necessary for a meaningful relationship. On its own, it only lasts between 12 to 18 months. It then needs to move onto such things as common world views, similar interests and intellects, discussion, all of which require discourse and a familiarity with the surrounding culture.<br>  <br>  To make matters worst, acculturation is a stressful process and many, after a period of time, would look to alleviate that stress by returning to more familiar shores.<br>  <br>  My heart sincerely wishes this to work for you. My brain, however, is sceptical.<br>  <br>  All the best!|`|4uB0bbhnaa	as they say , Love conquers all<br>  <br>  I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work<br>  <br>  The man can easily teach her the British culture <br>  just as she can teach him about her own culture
kvmWDuOJaa	Well if there was an attraction between you, I highly doubt that he will be completely uninterested now.<br>  Just go for it, otherwise you will regret it later and always wonder whether anything could have happened.<br>  I'm sure it will go really well, and if it doesn't you don't have anything to lose.<br>  Just try to get to know him as a friend, and then you can gradually start flirting. You may be a shy person, but eventually it will come naturally :) !<br>  <br>  If I helped, please consider voting for me?

nBGjPwViaa	Get on w/life...<br>  If you get back together, fine.<br>  If not, so be it...<br>  Sometimes, timing is just off for everyone....|`|lkxFy681aa	Get over it?<br>  <br>  That usually helps.<br>  Clinging on to something that you can't have will slow you down.<br>  Move on, there's plenty more fish in the sea.|`|cNySQ2axaa	well... does he know his girlfriend is cheating on him?? I would think if he knew she cheats on him he would break up with her..|`|2g8m8USQaa	Move on. There is a reason why you are not with him anymore. What makes you think that if you were to get back together, that things would change? You just said you can't trust him. I don't see how you can love anyone you can't trust. <br>  <br>  Things happen for a reason. Don't wait around for him to "come to his senses". If he really wanted to be back with you, he would have told you as much and asked for your forgiveness. He also would have broken up with his girlfriend. That being said, cheating is a deal breaker for me...once a cheater, always a cheater. That doesn't change.<br>  <br>  EMT|`|eF92uM2Saa	What?  Do you just need reassssurance that it's acceptable to tell him you are interested again? Go for it. It's o.k.<br>  <br>  You can have him, if you want him. He said so.<br>  <br>  You've no obligation to respect this other girl's claim if he still has a thing for you, especially if she is cheating on him and besides, you dated him first.<br>  <br>  So, go hunt him down and bag him.  What's the problem?|`|vg1WARiIaa	Okay, first of all, things happen.<br>  People do stupid things...even and especially in a guys case!<br>  <br>  if it were me <br>  (and you dont have to take my advice, its just what i would do if i was convinced i really loved this guy)<br>  i would give this guy another chance if he breaks up with that "beeach" who cheats on him.<br>  <br>  ps: does he know she cheats on him?<br>        because as his friend you should tell him and then he is all yours if you want him|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	Girl get proof of what she is doing behind his back but do not be the one to show him. He'll think that you showed him that just to hurt him back after what he done to you. An when he is shown what she has done be there to pick up the pieces of his heart. Then look in his eye's to see if he has changed from learning what he had done to you.|`|kWKZoQogaa	Tell him! Tell him you still love him. If he knows his girlfriend is cheating on him, he may just be looking for a chance to be with you again.|`|LJTSpOd4aa	well if he really loved you then he would dump that gf of his. and if you told him how you felt then he would probably be with you right now|`|1y81ro4Aaa	s his d, and don't leave him with blue balls either.|`|jJ152e8Iaa	I have a similar situation. What i did was MOVE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!! once a cheater, always a cheater!!! i am GLAD his gf cheated on him, now he knows how much it hurts and how much of a idiot he was to lose you.<br>  <br>  DO NOT BUY THAT BULLSHIT OF "THERE IS A FUTURE BETWEEN US"  its all fake its just a back up. He is scared to be a lone soo he tells you that so he has a "back up" girlfriend in case things don't work out for then he will come for you.<br>  <br>  What a coincidence that my ex was 4 years also, and i broke it off with him before he cheated on me and cuz he was abusive. But he came back to me asking for forgiveness and thought i was going to give it to him but i told him no. You need to be tough and strong, and say no.<br>  <br>  He also came back after a year of not talking to try and hit up on me, and he knew i was with someone else. But i told him off. <br>  <br>  Don't get back with him, it will makes thing weird and awkward, and you guys will be jealous and insecure and it wont be so healthy in the end for the both of you..... <br>  <br>  In the end, just forget about him, move on. The world if full of liars and hypocrite, if you are lucky, you will find the right guy.<br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|y681j1XKaa	One make it known how you feel about him, and give it some time, i say like 3weeks, if he still isnt back with you move on. You need to meet more new people, dont get caught up on just one guy, there is probably a guy out there who will make you feel as if you are the greatest person ever and never cheat on you to begin with, look if sex is involved and yall r young, thats probably why he wants to get back with you. Sex is something u should wait for 20+ so much drama involved.<br>  <br>  Goodluck Constant!|`|rswiEosSaa	I think you should stop wasting your time...if he is not leaving his "cheating" girlfriend immediately for someone like you who cares for him so much then wake up and smell the Folgers hun...HE IS JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU. His self-esteem is probably in the sh***er now since his girlfriend is cheating on him. He is feeding your head with lies so you could keep boosting his ego. He is probably really in love with his girlfriend now, since he is still with her although she is cheating on him and treating him badly. Sorry babe, you need to move on and stop wasting your life on a jerk.|`|gniKjoG8aa	Hmmmm, considering the fact he hasn't tried to make a blatent move on you says something... possibly that he's changed?<br>  <br>  Otherwise he'd be trying to sleep with you more than anything, but he's not, even with a crappy girlfriend.<br>  <br>  It's time you kicked that b*tches a-s-s and took back your old boyfriend!  And tell him if he ever thinks about cheating on you in the future, you'll kill his entire family!|`|MkK8pHgWaa	defiantly don't you wait for him....but do not make a move with him until he breaks up with the current girlfriend..that would be wrong of him to cheat.. you know how that feels....but usually if he cheated once he will cheat twice...but some ppl can change and realize their mistakes...but it takes you and him to figure this one out|`|lpyIKYUXaa	Are you 100% sure he isn't going to cheat on you again?<br>  Think about it. <br>  He 'loved' you enough to cheat on you.<br>  I know that souns harsh but rack your brains a little, do you even really love him or are you just wanting to get back into a comfort zone with him. Maybe you like him because he has a girlfriend?<br>  If he loved you that much why doesn't he break up with her to be with you?<br>  ask youself these q's, i hope i helped :) x|`|2DD410m9aa	you shud deffinatly fight 4 him<br>  if you love him and he loves you as much as you say you do then this otha girl shudnt even matter especially if she cheats on him all the tme<br>  he is probably jus wif her to stop thinkin about you<br>  jus go for it chik whats the worst that could happen|`|A6Owp9SAaa	How old are you, move on with your life if he didn't  not care for you in the first place then whats the point in sticking around to see what happens its been four yrs and nothing happened he probably thinks your a tool|`|1W7Endxtaa	Tell his cousin what you feel, and don't worry, your words will reach him. but don't try to get him and his gf to break up. he needs to decide that on his own. if it's really meant to be...it'll work|`|8EK6Bj3Haa	I would try it again. If he says that the thing he regrets most in his life is cheating on you, then I think he's remorseful. Try it again! Good luck!!!! :)|`|QilfSBfsaa	Now he has another girlfriend, forget him.|`|ODblt2gTaa	forget him honey...i know it can be tempting to go back to a familiar place but the only thing there waiting for you is heartache....your better off on your own......|`|SouPhkgxaa	Forget him and move on :]|`|vs7JYKmOaa	if his gf cheat you should find a way to prove it! then u can have da guy|`|0297b913d93d60ad18f3e83648c612fcaa	In my opinion, what goes around comes around.  This guy cheated on you, and even if he SAYS he regrets it...and even if he DOES regret it, then that's no excuse.  <br>  <br>  Trust me, You will never be able to trust him again.  I'm not going to say the old adage of "once a cheater, always a cheater" because I know it's not true (I have cheated before), but you will never be able to fully trust someone who betrays your confidence like that.<br>  <br>  Move on.  You might care for him as a friend so be a friend and stay out of it.|`|dK0RO1sLaa	hun im in the same situation right now except im the one that has a boyfriend and my ex who cheated on me wants me back. i love him so much and he was the best thing that had ever happened to me. i am really considering everything and i want to get back with him. <br>  <br>  if i were you i would just wait it out see where his relationship goes with his new girlfriend. if she really is cheating on him you should tell him. and tell him how you feel about him that you want to be with him and you dont want him to get hurt with his new gf like he hurt you when you were dating. <br>  <br>  and make sure that he really does regret cheating on you and not just saying it. get him to do something to prove to you and everyone else that you care about that he really does love you to gain your trust back.<br>  <br>  its not going to easy. for the both of you. there will be some trust issues still but at least you will be working things out.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps you at least a little bit.|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	then tell him wat u feel for him<br>  dont hide ur feelings or else nothin will change<br>  also idk y u let his gf cheat on him<br>  y dnt u tell him the truth bout everythin<br>  tell him ull forget the path<br>  and that u realize u need him and want him<br>  if he truly feels the same way<br>  he will do the rite thing<br>  and go wit u and all will be well|`|QP8LdPLeaa	"What am I supposed to do? Wait until he breaks up with his girlfriend?"<br>  <br>  um what  else can you do? respect the fact that they are together now<br>  <br>  "I know he really loves me because he waited for me and loved me for all those years"<br>  <br>  its funny he loved you then, but not enough to keep his pants on when he cheated on you.<br>  <br>  its such a mystery on WHY women want a guy who cheats on them. no wonder men whine on how women want jerks all the time. if his girlfriend is cheating on him, then Karma just slapped him in the face, and no wonder hes regretting cheating on you because he knows how it feels now.<br>  <br>  if you really want to jerk so bad, then just wait. thats all you can do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  he made-out, oh wow i guess thats acceptable. NOT. he still got invovled sexually with someone else.
GLBWe3A9aa	A need for the other person almost all the time.<br>  Willingness to do basically anything for them.<br>  And enjoyment of doing nothing with them and still have fun :D<br>  Or at least i hope|`|62gMbgb1aa	True love is nopt defined by both parties, what you are saying might be the definition of "successfull relationship", when both parties are working hard to to make it worth, to make it happen, but dont forget that there is sometimes a true love from only one side when one person only is trying had to make hard.<br>  in my opinion, true love is never defined, but it might be something like doing things that you never imagined yourself doing, and doing things that are just not logical and smile when you find out that it is only not logical, like loosing yourself and stop thinking what you want, but what the other want, when you dont know time when you are together, when you get crazy each time you are together, and when you keep falling to the person you are in love with each time you are together, enjoying their negative part as you enjoy their positive parts.  this might be a true love.<br>  It can come on a plate, but need willingless from both to continue and develop beyound all limits.|`|YVI8Niteaa	true love does not come on a plate<br>  exactly it does need both ppls willingness to make things work and it juss takes a while to develope

n9IZtcD0aa	we are all crazy.  it's common knowledge, you should know that.  but, honestly, women like it when men are forceful and it is very rare that we get to see that anymore in society without it being violent.  so it turns us on, we can't help it...it's leftover from that whole hunter gatherer grab your woman by the hair and drag her off mentality.|`|XB996f1naa	heck no! why would i like for him to be mad at me?<br>  of course if you were only standing up for yourself then<br>  she might admire that in you.|`|s7us9819aa	No ..I don't like it when my bf gets mad.

Secondly send a letter to the The Times stating you have it on good authority his moustache to be a fake sign it HRH. Thirdly spread rumours that his family are new money, if all this doesn't have him topping himself within a week, well one can only assume he is not a British gentleman and you can rest assured you are indeed the better man. Tip top.|`|mMmNEljxaa	Eat some asparagus then offer to collect his tea for him at the day centre and discreetly urinate in it he will surely choke on it.|`|TGRUUWiwaa	Just remember the old adage dear boy. <br>  "Pensioners are like Slinky's..no fun unless you push them downstairs"<br>  <br>  Tip Top|`|ba4R1tf1aa	You leave him alone!<br>  He's been threatening to set sail again, and if he does, I'll be swimming beside his ship, singing to him, till he agrees to come back to me.

As for the laxative, very creative at least it does me some good, what do you take for woodworm? I didn't say that I wanted to see you drowned, I said I wanted to drown you but I'm damned if I can find out how to do it, you will keep on floating to the top. As for that swine Rotter, assassination eh, not a English gentleman eh? we will see about that when Cuthbertson puts a larger gap between his teeth with his trusty 'Acme' knuckle dusters. The man is a damned charlatan, he doesn't have a pair of Swedish twins, they are East German shot putters called Gerda and Brunhilda. wouldn't surprise me if his moustache was a fake  and just drawn on. I would dearly love a battle of wits with you two but I don't believe in fighting unarmed opponents.
e17a481ffb1070224bb1ee961cdfb9a2aa	First you talk to your best friend. Let see his reaction. About just ask her do you like me any chance? Than she might be answer your question. If she ask why do you want  to know? Then you said, " I am just want to know." If thing is not work out than you still can be her friend. How about you ask, " her why do you like my best friend?" May be help you figure out those answer it.|`|cQaKjnyxaa	if you say you wouldnt mind risking it then i would say totally go for it and who knows it might actually work. so i say go for it. and see wat happens. but jsut be ready for wat ever happens.|`|8Vv7hE4yaa	ime just staying quiet usually screws u over the girl would much rather have u man up and tell her what u feel before someone else does|`|8a1241304d2dd7e6f5c72ab504bd5db0aa	Tell her, or you might regret it.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I think you should stay quiet about it for now and take some time to weigh the options; you don't want to mess up a good friendship.

wh3BAc4taa	Maybe you haven't found the right person for you. Not all women likes you for what you have.|`|tJqG2q9uaa	well you dont really have to believe it ... you can choose to. The fact is that biologically women are attracted to men who can provide security for future children (hence rich) and men are attracted to women who have good child bearing proportions (wide hips, large breasts) and also who show that men are successful (society says a successful man will have a very attractive partner by the current standards). But most people dont fit into that extreme. <br>  I think women are under just as much pressure to be a million and one things. They're just different things. But I do think that if you intend to have children one day you need to be able to provide because a woman with kids is highly restricted in terms of being able to provide herself (ask any single mum.) You also need to show you are motivated enough to maintain employment even in troubled times. Women need to show they can nurture and provide care for her husband and children. I know its sexist etc. but its also the practical way life works ...|`|woTsBaeXaa	Not every girl is like that.  Many like to give as well. Mabey you've just run into the wrong girls.  There are some things though that girls need - like a safe place to be emotionally and financial stability - that's usually important to a girl.

otrlZuA3aa	Modern cellular telephones use digital technology and encryption to prevent monitoring using a simple scanner.<br>  <br>  The very old analogue phones could easily be monitored by a scanner, hence they were made obsolete and replaced by the new digital technology.<br>  <br>  Some cordless phones used in homes are still analogue and can be heard using a scanner around the 30Mhz range. These are slowly being replaced by digital cordless technology.<br>  <br>  It should be noted that, depending what country you are in, the receiving of transmissions passing over a telephone network is generally illegal. <br>  <br>  <br>  ****  MILDRED SENT ME HERE TO HELP YOU****|`|TinNG7k7aa	Most cell phones are digital these days.<br>  <br>  In the "old days" when cell phones were analog, you could pick them up with an unblocked scanner around 860-880 MHz.<br>  <br>  These days forget it, you need all kinds of digital decoding stuff. And the frequencies are higher too.<br>  <br>  So in summary? No, you cannot use police scanners in general to pick up cell phone conversations.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, some older cordless phones might be able to be intercepted by scanners. It depends on the age and subsequently the phone's radio frequency and whether the phone is a digital or analog phone.<br>  <br>  Older cordless phones are analog and run at relatively low frequencies. These are easily intercepted by most scanners.<br>  <br>  Digital phone signals by themselves are much harder to crack, but a clever person could figure it out probably by hacking a similar style of phone and modifying it's electronics.<br>  <br>  And yes, it is illegal to divulge whatever is learned from such eavesdropping unless you are operating under a police/court order.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I heard this years ago when cell phones first came out...  These days, I don't give it much thought because of the abundance of activity in the air-waves and strapped local and state police budgets...<br>  <br>  Oh, and this is illegally obtained evidence in your example, btw...|`|c1paW0bAaa	Mobile phones are just a type of fancy radio.  Yes, conversations can be listened in to.  However, for police, they need a warrant or the evidence gained is inadmissible in court.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Yes its true, Police scanners can pick up cell or mobile home phones, but it is illegal to listen in but nothing to stop you unless caught|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	If the frequencies cross-over by accident.|`|PeMpDAbraa	I don't know about cell phones but I know cordless phones can be picked up.

Id think I was a wimp if she could outeat me|`|f82bec804f3759de3af7ea875e7d57ebaa	That is alot of calories to consume at one time but its only the consumer's business. Flipping out even for the spouse would be out of line.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I'd tell him our next stop had to be at a medical supply facility because we were going to have to make a down payment on a defibrillator if those were his eating habits.|`|c6FrTkFRaa	its his choice! Men always order lots of food anyways... and most the time can never finish it! haha<br>  As long as he pays for those two burgers! lol|`|GtPnXzPAaa	I'd say, "Yeah, but what are YOU gonna eat."|`|VQs0adT8aa	I would be worried/curious as to why he felt that hungry.  I doubt my husband could finish two huge burgers.|`|AA11106650	No maybe they want one now, and one for later|`|96ndKQncaa	if my spouse wanted me to pay for it ^-^|`|EdDLydH7aa	No, sometimes you are just hungry, no reason to flip out, if he flipped out on you or the other way around, why do it? All it does is cause arguments and who needs all that drama? If little things like that are gonna cause arguments just don't go out to eat together, problem solved|`|2PAfywbuaa	Yes. Totally. Eating 2 triple whoppers is illigal in my country, haha XD|`|SQOo0n4Laa	Nope.. I eat a lot too!! I eat so much but I don't get any bigger.. So weird...|`|WSfpRKIHaa	Only if my "spouse" was fat.

I'd take it in stride...  I cannot picture this, though, either lol.|`|5afa5bd19226d3326c9f6bc410b563e1aa	Yes, I would think it is discusting.  If my hubby was thinner I would laugh thinking he would never finish them anyway.<br>  If he is heavy i would be very worried about his health|`|vKYdV5r2aa	MY last BK order was 5 triple whopper with cheese 2 large fries  and 2 extra large cokes and it was just me and my 9yr old
7cjqT33Baa	My husband is smarter than that...but to answer your question, no I would not kiss him.  I find the habit disgusting and I wouldn't kiss a smoker or someone that chewed.<br>  If that was my husband, I'd threaten to cut my hair off (he loves my hair) if he insisted on chewing because if he didn't care about remaining attractive to me, I'd stop maintaining my hair and worrying about being attractive to him.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I guess he isn't thinking about throat cancer, losing his voice box n' vocal chords, losing part(or all), of his tongue, along with his teeth.<br>  <br>  It would be hard to kiss him then.  Because it would be, almost physically impossible, at least where his face is concerned.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	No, an ash-tray I will kiss, but not brown gunky teeth.  We all have our limits.|`|0gFdt7VUaa	H*ll no! Thats nasty!|`|VQs0adT8aa	My husband is smarter than that too.  But no, I would not.  I draw the line after he eats burgers with pickles and mustard until he brushes (I dislike both of those smells/tastes).|`|jBigEy0Caa	No, gross habit.  Tell him to reconsider, especially if it is a new habit.|`|PeMpDAbraa	No. It's disgusting!|`|yIGVOqXdaa	ugh! no!!!|`|u1uECuFNaa	No way.<br>  That is nasty. <br>  If he started smoking I would not kiss him.<br>  I would find him therapy for his midlife crisis because he knows what things like that do to a person...|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No. Kissing someone who uses that stuff is like lapping a dirty ashtray.
oqQdutsfaa	best thing, you dont have to deal with all the stress of the person you devored and worst thing, you have to start all over again!|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Not have to deal with a nagging spouse that I did not trust, and having my freedom to go and do as I pleased and I am still single after 14 years and not loving it so much any more wanting to have a wife again and perhaps another child .|`|jMLa696Taa	I guess the worst thing is not being with your spouse, the best thing is...no best thing...heehhehe, i don't want to be divorce.|`|gYEjrtl3aa	Loneliness dark days scared to look outside.<br>  <br>  The good side just to see a passing car.  Good luck|`|EdDLydH7aa	The best part about being single is that I don't have to deal with a very jealous, abusive spouse...obviouly that's the best part, the worst part is trying to get to meet and know new people who aren't looking for one night-stands and all of that,drama, but it sucks being single, i admit it, but it's 100% better than being in a bad marraige...so good luck|`|KXyyGvwKaa	The best thing is being free if you have no kids and no debt together.The worst thing is seeing that person or their family members when all you want to do is get on with life|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Being alone is the worst thing. And the best thing is not having to answer to anyone. Sad...|`|1HTRWrawaa	The best....the list is long. I know longer have to put up with his crap. Wait on him, clean up his messes, and have to let him know every minute of the day where I am and when I will be home.<br>  <br>  It's so wonderful to wake up in the morning refreshed and not dead tired from listening to him snore all night. To come home from work and the house is still clean and stays that way. I eat what I want and when I want and don't have to feel guilty because I only want soup and a sandwich for dinner and he wants me to cook a 5 course meal. I go where I want and come home when I feel like it. I live a stress free life without all the arguing and without a husband, my bills are finally paid on time each month, because he isn't spending more then we make.<br>  <br>  I always thought happiness was falling in love, getting married, and spending the rest of my life with that person. I was wrong. The happiest years of my life have been spent as a single person. <br>  <br>  Yes, it would be nice if the fairy tale was true, but for me it never has been. I am content with being single.<br>  <br>  Men can't get it through their heads. That there comes a time when a woman is just fed up with always having to take care of someone. We raise our children, but then there is still our husband who thinks it's our job to take care of them, because they are too lazy to take care of them self. They want you to do all or most of the housework, cooking and even wash their clothes. I'm in the medical field and take care of people for living. Do you think I want to come home and take care of some lazy demanding husband? Get real!!!!!<br>  <br>  The worst thing about being single....money! I have only myself to depend on financially. If I lose my job, become sick for a long period of time, in a car accident and can't work for a long time, I'm screwed. So I have to make sure I put money away for a rainy day. Also I find that some things are more fun to do as a couple.<br>  <br>  Marriage has it's good and bad. You have to decide for yourself, if you are happier when you are married or single and then ask yourself why. Money is not a good reason to be married or sex or even so you won't be alone.

She told me they had broken up and she ended up seducing me. <br>  <br>  My best friend heard about it and called me to tell me that it was another little spat that they had had.

It is not worth it.  Plus, if he is coming on to you too , then he is probably doing that to several girls.  He is probably a flirt, so be careful how you act around him, but best friends stick together no matter what.|`|RR4oRK4Paa	You will have to let it go. That is a major no-no in the girl world. There are millions of men in the US. Find one from a neighboring school so it will be fun. If you are seriously seeking find one in AIM chat rooms or match.com or craigslist.org. The truth we all have to remember.. we may like him but obviously he likes her... because if he liked you so much.. he would be dating you right now!|`|m3NVpPpiaa	That would be morally wrong to act on that. If she is your best friend, don't betray her. There are plenty of other guys out there. It's not worth destroying a friendship. Think about it!

People date friends X's all the time. If they have a really strong bond then breaking them up would just not be friendly at all, but if they are just hangin and bangin and there is no real feelings then wait until it's over then you can pursue the guy. good luck.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	First question, are you willing to loose your best friend over a guy? I mean friends last longer than boyfriends so its probably not worth it. <br>  <br>  And you don't want to hurt her, do you? So I'd just forget about him and move on. It may be hard but think of all the drama it will cause. And your other friends will probably side with her because it WAS her Bf....<br>  <br>  Good lluckk!!|`|YFvXRutJaa	it all depend on the situation, for instance how long have ya'll been best friend, do ya'll respect each other personal life or do ya'll seem to interfere with each other existence of one another. out of all respect it doesn't seem like ya'll are best friend so do what you think is right for you.|`|bQvzpuuraa	that happened to me and there is nothing you can do im sorry to say that it caused a huge fight and we aren't best friends anymore but they weren't dating yet and i told her i really liked him and i talked to this guy and told him and then they started dating a week later :( so idk what to tell you im sorry it is unfortunate but you can thelp these feelings hang in there!|`|WnqSaVWmaa	That happens often!  but just think.

l2OdlMTZaa	Dear, It s alright if you feel very serious about it. But I would suggest you should not experiment to lose Ur virginity for such a night now. Always keep in mind that extra marital sex has its own great risks both now and in your committed marriage later on. A person of good sound character would not lose Ur future person for some nights of seemingly sweet friends or boy friends. It is extra caution ground for players of female sex. This is out of my experience with my darling wife for the past 22 years.
94faf4d1d380dfc7f0731bbb8873018eaa	I don;t think there is enough information there to make a decision. Do you make eye contact - how long for? Does he avoid making eye contact? Does he groom himself in front of you. Does he laugh at your jokes? Does he seem nervous/excited when you enter his space? These are the more obvious signs. There could be a 100 reasons for the other actions you named.|`|RONmoue9aa	errm he likes you but if anything happens between you it wont go well coz he cant even be around you on his own|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	Honey it may destroy your guys friendship that's why he says it's a mistake about the kiss. But ask other friends about your current relationship to see if they agree with your guy friend. But if you do decide that you and he may be able to have a relationship think about the cons of that. If it doesn't work out then you lose a friend but if it does work it will be the greatest thing to ever happen.|`|OntO6wE4aa	You have a boyfriend and you have a guy friend an it seems that their showing you more respect than you show them. Your guy friend protects himself from what looks like your obvious teasing. He knows you have a boyfriend and he's respecting your choice by helping you live by it. He's probably trying to tell you that your better friends than lovers. If you keep acting like you want more, might put an end to your friend relationship. He thinks your important else he wouldn't stay around you. Support his wishes. Who knows maybe something in the future will happen. Just enjoy his friendship. good luck|`|wnr9S9kuaa	If I were you or the guy then I would just ignore it.  You have a boyfriend of your own.  Who cares what the other guy says.|`|Xprsabo9aa	what are you asking (:|`|n9IZtcD0aa	he may just love you but not be in love with you.  even in that situation it is very hard not to be jealous or attracted to someone if they are the type of person you would normally be attracted to.  i have a friend like that, i love him so much i never thought i'd love someone so much and not be in love with him but i love richard that way.  it's hard to see him with other girls, it's hard to think that as much as we care about each other it isn't right for us to be together, and it's difficult to be always supportive.  but if he's acting like that then you should talk to him.  don't accuse him of being in love with you but just ask him what's up.  then see where it goes.  good luck.|`|BbaR8Hhqaa	idk really. i would think who do you like more?<br>  <br>  did u really every think about the makeout u 2 had??<br>  i mean its obviously kinda in your mind if you brought it up cuz that means u rmbr. tell him u dont like him that way but u still wanna hang with him.|`|e7884f002f39be8533e93b8f6f74759daa	You never really asked a definitive question??|`|xM912JfXaa	Get over your self

sKCB6mO1aa	Sounds like she might be playing games.  But you should ask her, talk to her about how she's acting different towards you.  If she doesn't give you a straight answer, then let her go.  Find someone who isn't into mind games.  Life's too short.<br>  <br>  You'll drive yourself nuts trying to guess at it.  Talk to her.|`|piuEx0BJaa	if i had to guess it sounds like you scared her off by telling her you were in love with her. depending on how old you are that is a very serious thing to tell your girlfriend and she might not feel as attached to you as you are to her. my point is i think you may have freaked her out by being so attached to her and saying you are in love with her. and its hard to tell if your in love with someone in only three months maybe you should try backing off a little.|`|RONmoue9aa	shes doin all your friends|`|NJ9Ytksraa	Don't worry about it. You're early in this relationship so just give her some space and then she will come running back to you.|`|AA12384954	Sounds like she is not in as much of a hurry for a permanent relationship as you seem to be.  By pushing the "in love" question you have basically put her in an awkward situation.  Things were going along as they should until then; just back off a little and don't be in such of a rush.  Remember ... Marry in haste, repent at leisure.  You should still be focusing on having a good time at the moment, not building the lasting for ever and ever marriage.|`|vHP1VH2Qaa	There are so many things that can be happening on her end. She could not really feel the same way to you and was scared off. Maybe she just doesn't know how to act now that it is out in the open. Maybe she has some guy on the side and feels guilty. We have no way of knowing. There is one thing you can do to answer your question, ask her, not us.<br>  <br>  A few weeks ago I was having my own lady troubles and posted on Y!A for some advice. I did get some decent advice that helped me out a bit. But what really hit me hard was when she IMed me asking if I always got my relationship advice from the internet. My heart stopped. I panicked a bit. She had found my post where I had spilled my heart and knew everything I was thinking. Turns out that was the best thing that could have happened.<br>  <br>  She asked me why I couldn't just come to her and talk about it. Things had been awkward between us for a little while and I didn't know how to approach her. So she told me to talk to her about it the next time I saw her. I did, and now we are both happy. No more awkward, no more confusion. Things are how they should be. And wanna know the greatest part? All of the advice I got on Y!A was helpful, but so far off the mark it would have killed me.<br>  <br>  The moral of the story is that in situations like this the only answer that is truly going to help you out is the one she gives you when you talk to her. Just talk to her about it. Tell her that you enjoyed what you had and that you really care for her and now it has changed and you want to know why. Don't be a creep about it and profess your love for her and kiss her feet. Be respectful and honest and open with her and she will return the favor.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and talk to her.<br>  <br>  BTW: read the whole thing and skimmed the answers.|`|vg1WARiIaa	I agree with that other girl who answered your question. "Unidentified"<br>  <br>  i think that now that she knows your actually IN love with her, she wants to make sure everything goes right from here on out and maybe she wants to make sure she is actually IN love with you.<br>  <br>  but i think that this is completely normal in new and forming relationships. =P<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|DbVGKvcTaa	Paragraphs are your friend.<br>  <br>  Anyway, see how a woman changes when she becomes your girlfriend?  Imagine how much she'd change upon marriage; it's just a fact of life. <br>  <br>  When the mystery disappears between two people, the theme of the relationship changes.  Doesn't this remind you of getting bored with a toy you once had?|`|8SbKEkBKaa	don't be worried. yes i'm sure it is just a phase she's going through. chances are she feels the exact same way you do and it scares her. maybe she doesn't know how to handle her strong feelings for you especially when she knows you feel the same way. maybe she's wondering....so what's the next step? maybe marriage is going through her head and the thought of that is too much. i wouldn't confront her about why she's changed. i think it's obvious why she's changed and it's ok for her to not know how to act. it was safer when you two were just buddies so why not treat you like a buddy. just talk to her about her thought and intentions of your future together. i'm sure she's on yahoo answers asking people "my boyfriend just told me he's in love with me and while i feel the same i just don't know how to act what do i do???" haha.... she'll be so relieved when it's you she can open up to. and the same goes for you.<br>  <br>  i thought i'd be able to write more then you...oh well looks like you won :)|`|IYzMqNJDaa	Yes I read the whole thing. You don't say how old you are but love can be a scary thing. Maybe you scared her when you told her you were "in love" with her and she's pulling back. Three months is a awful short time to be falling in love with someone. Take it slow and if it's meant to be it will happen. Talk to her and ask her if she thinks your moving a little to fast. You need to find out what she is feeling before you can move ahead. Good luck!|`|QtJH37KRaa	Have you every heard the song more than words by extreme? Ok well if you haven't listen to it. Basically it says, I shouldn't have to tell you I love you, you should already know. If you are doubting her love then you are also doubting yours. Its not so much that she is afraid of it, but maybe she doesn't like PDA. Yes she started off liking it, but people change.  How do you reassure her, you hold her close while you are at home, look her in the eyes and tell her that she means the world to you, and you couldn't be happier that you met her. Tell her she completes you, that even know you may be opposites at somethings, you are more like yin and yang, you complete each other. If she doesn't want to touch in public then lay off of her, its nothing to worry about, you are worrying more than she is silly.  Also she should be more than just your girlfriend, she should also be a best friend.<br>  Remember more than words. You shouldn't always have to express how you feel, you should already know, and so should she.|`|VSXUa9lraa	I can read and answer you :]<br>  Talking is the key to everything.<br>  Just ask her what happened, because at first she was loving and close but after she asked the love question, it was like you two became friends again.<br>  Compromising is what makes a relationship work, my boyfriend didn't want to do somewhat passionate things and that pissed me off and I had some long conversations about it and we worked it out, we split what we both wanted. You need to tell your girlfriend that you want her to be the same person that she used to be- even if it's just a little bit, that you feel like she's not the same person you fell in love with. And she needs to tell you why she changed, and why she will or won't change back or regain some of the same qualities.|`|ucbrBXK2aa	im not sure what to tell you, all i have as advice is to talk to her about it , and try not to get her upset. but just  ask if there is something bothering her or tell her you think she is acting different.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|x9FienLUaa	She is still there-I just  think she just cannot express herself too clearly, be patient spend time really trying to talk to her to get her to feel that she can trust you with her feelings.  she says she is good at hiding her feelings maybe cause she always had to and now doesn't know how to trust. One thing you should never do is dissappoint her- one that happens her guard goes back up. You need to be reliable and someone she can depend on---Good Luck!  she sounds like a keeper|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	Ummm...I think the best thing to do is to just be forward. At least she'll respect that. Because if something is wrong, and she thinks that you know there is and aren't doing anything, it'll just make things worse. I would just say, "hey, it feels like things are a little different between us lately. Is something wrong, or did I do something?...etc. Bueno Suerte|`|OAIjRoTdaa	xD Lol i dont like reading but .. Have you really talked about it with her?<br>  When you ask her. Dont say theres something wrong with you.<br>  Ask her why she's been acting different.|`|CVk2dWiDaa	Forget what everyone else is saying, confront her!|`|gzjq7AnTaa	pms|`|0297b913d93d60ad18f3e83648c612fcaa	I think the best thing you could do would be just to sit her down and ask.  Don't "accuse" and say that you hate it all (even if you do!) but merely  her, in a private setting with no distractions, that you've noticed a change in her behavior.  Ask her if there's something on her mind she wants to share or not share... and let he know that you're there for her and you love her regardless...<br>  <br>  She might just have something on her mind other than you (and I dont' mean that in a mean way), and it's throwing her off.|`|2gCE27rEaa	You should just tell her exactly what u just said and see what she says!! If she gets upset or mad then obviously things rnt going 2 work out. Hope I could help!!!|`|8eSKDlihaa	You are WAY over thinking this . Give yourself a breather , stop over analyzing it all . When you see her next ask her whats going on if anything because this is how YOU feel . Not her necessarily as you are saying you are confused  perhaps she was having an off day and not feeling cuddly or whatever but asking her probably will upset her so be prepared to tell her this is how you feel and that it is not an attack on her just your own uncertainties needing to be dealt with .|`|AA10525436	Seems like after saying you're IN LOVE with her, she's scared away. She's either not "in love" with you but just cares for you or she has someone else and is trying to figure out what she wants to do. No other reason for her to distance herself|`|rOe3VuLQaa	ok if really think someone is gonna read all of that ur crazy
G1f545lJaa	WTH IS WRONG WITH YOU|`|dItZAwI2aa	I want to watch my girlfriend have sex with my dad is that weird?<br>  <br>  ya think?|`|C4N3TM3maa	no thats perfectly normal and why dnt u have sex with you mom??<br>  no dude thats just gross!!!!!|`|AA10937211	okay that is just nasty!!!...not that the fact that you want to watch her with another dude...but your dad!!! why do you want to see your dad screwing anyone...that's just wrong guy|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	hey what ever you fantasize about should not be said here on yahoo|`|dx9AZ16Paa	what the f u c k.<br>  you are weird!<br>  you need to be looked up in a hospital somewhere|`|mCXUo7DRaa	I dont even know were to began how bought you go play with your dad and ask your girlfriend to watch!!!!! <br>  hope this helps!!!!<br>  <br>  FREAK|`|lE9iAueBaa	ya just a bit
T4tVKZ5zaa	its not lame at all. its fine im sure when the time is right your first time will be better than all those people that made fun of you was (:|`|F3LBgfvwaa	That's not lame. Having herpes and getting pregnant as a teenager is lame.|`|eeHrcxjEaa	No.  It's a very smart idea.  And they'll make fun of you.... up until they die of AIDS.  Sucks for them.<br>  <br>  THIS is lame.  Actually more than lame.  This is disgusting... don't be this, please:<br>  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2233878.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/new...</a>|`|vkIkFgqiaa	I might edit this, but right now i'm to lazy to type. DON'T HAVE SEX TILL Mirage! They are going to see who's cool when they get AIDS, pregnant and more STD's. Then they give there chilled aids and it dyes!<br>  <br>  If you are just trying to get people to say no "yes" (user name) to make an excuse you are lying to yourself. Don't base big decisions just because some stupid person on YA said it.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Not at all. That's just something society tries to convince us of. It's best to wait until you know you're ready than to give in to peer pressure. Your time will come.|`|ifTMSSjdaa	NOPE!<br>  -don't give into peer pressure|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Only if you think being a slu+ is cool|`|AA11447210	Why is it their business that you are or are not a virgin?<br>  <br>  It's not lame. What's lame (and stupid and irresponsible) is people (esp teens) who have sex without being able to take responsibility if pregnancy should occur or an STD should be transmitted. How many kids do you know that have money to pay medical bills for that stuff? My guess is zero.<br>  <br>  You're not lame sugar, you're the smart one. They are lame because they let their hormones over rule their good judgement.|`|EPdYI9f1aa	Not at all!! That's just peer pressure that you will have to go through your entire teenage life. Even if it was lame, it would just be lame at the moment, choosing to be lame then gives you a brighter future, all those other people won't even have a future because they will have an STD. Don't give in to peer pressure, wait for the right moment, God will let you know your time.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	No, you're not. That's ridiculous. Don't listen to people at school. Chances are many of them are virgins too. And if they're not they're going to be the ones in heartache, ending up pregnant, etc. <br>  <br>  I am waiting until I get married to have sex and I'm very happy with my decision.|`|NRR4q2g3aa	im not a virgin but...being 1 is not lame the jonas brothers are virgins so is adrianna lima|`|IGQw4267aa	if you're lame i'm lame.<br>  <br>  mine por favor?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlygtJNO_oSzP7P8aG0DuE3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222102706AAXFucX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NDoyhCZYaa	I guarantee about 98% of those kids at your school who say they're not virgins are lying.|`|QNuzWDc1aa	Psh, don't listen to the kids at school!  You should be prousd to be a virgin!  You're deffinatley not lame!|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Nope, I'm 19 and I'm a virgin.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Don't worry about them. They use to tease other kids as well. Just because they were being sex hounds and wanted to act mature. You are not lame. I am 17 and I am still a virgin. Do I think it is lame, no. It shows how in control you are of yourself. <br>  <br>  I don't think you shouldn't of told them. But I guess it is to late now. Don't care what they think. Just because you are not out there being a **** or manwhore.|`|eJ4IR5Epaa	No your not lame, take it from us women. When the time is right for you, you will know. You shouldn't feel uncomfortable or scared, thats something to lose when you are happy and content with yourself in your relationship. Many many women I know regret not saving it until the time was right. Including myself. If kids in your school think it's stupid, they are immature and irresponsible. You are not lame, you are smart for waiting.|`|2hcA3VP9aa	no because i am sure that most of the kids that make fun of you are virgins too and the ones that are not probably either have an std or a baby on the way. i was a virgin when i was in school but now i own my own Business and am proud to say that i don't have a std. i hope this helps have a good one|`|UE9e10Avaa	no way jose'! being a virgin is probably the most un-lame thing to be. all the immature pubescents at your school that make fun of you will get their karma when they contract an std and/or become pregnant at an early age. you should be respected for this and not beaten down. geez, what's this world coming too...|`|ay2ksWhsaa	no its not lame i have a 23 year old friend who is a virgin.  He is a cool guy.  And sex isnt that great, i dont no what the big deal is, its not so fun that you deserve a title if you havnt had it.|`|edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	No it's not lame to be a virgin.  It's emotionally and physically dangerous to be promiscuous.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	being a virgin is hawt as hell. They ar jealous you have something they lost and will never get back. Hold on to it.<br>  all single ladies put a ring on it.lol|`|dUglyCKDaa	No. I am a virgin. It just means that you have your dignity. And you dont want a silly person to take it from you.|`|N5nbOkvGaa	How do they know?<br>  o_O<br>  And no, it's not, it means that you're the only smart one in your school. Ignore them!|`|utIErJuPaa	no its fine to be a virgin|`|OcISFpRdaa	no your not lame. lose it when you love someone|`|md66E0LWaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  unless of course 30 yrs old and not had a religious calling!!!!!|`|EeabLB5eaa	They probally all are too. You should really tell them to stop worrying if you are or not.|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	NO! because if you save it for someone you really love and want to spend the rest of your life with, it becomes more special!|`|cr1cUCKVaa	ur not lame.|`|WJhKUMsVaa	UH NOOOO!!! BEING A VIGRIN IS AWESOME!!<br>  <br>  (Not that I'd know that cause' I totally get some like all the time.)|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	No, it's not lame. I bet a lot of the people that make fun of you are virgins themselves or wish they still were. It was the same when I went to school. I thought I was the only one that had never been with a guy. So when I went ahead and kind of forced myself on this poor boy, it turned out that of all my so called hot friends, only one wasn't a virgin anymore. What's worse, when it came out that I had been devirginized, some girls stopped hanging out with me. So... you just continue being a virgin until you meet your prince charming (or princess, can't see if you are girl or boy). Yup. And he (she) is a-coming, you know, it's a matter of time.|`|oGc617Ppaa	Its definitely not 'lame'.<br>  <br>  You don't have to worry about pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. And you can wait until you're in a long-lasting relationship. Or save yourself for marriage. You can never get your virginity back once its gone.<br>  <br>  I don't know your age or location, but it may be illegal, and your friends could be committing statutory rape.<br>  <br>  Dont feel bullied into it, there are plenty of virgins older than you.|`|LdlNMvsbaa	NOOOOOOO!!!!!<br>  <br>  Honestly, I'm in school, and I think its soo sick! That doesn't even appeal to me...like ew?  If people make fun of you, just say "um seriously? You ACTUALLY care??"  Because the're being patetic. <br>  <br>  Also, pre-marital sex (sex before marriage) is a sin. It's supposed to be a gift after marriage. So don't do it because once you've done it, you can't get your virginity back.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, it's totally worth waiting!!! You will probably get an STD or something, and sex completely changes a relationship. So don't worry about what other people say. They're gross.|`|lqOxBiiFaa	No, i dont think being a virgin is lame,<br>  because if you have sex at a young age it could ruin your life, <br>  and think about all the diseases. so your not lame ,<br>  i also think its cool being a virgin :)|`|bDl0wgVhaa	No, being a virgin is not lame it shows that you have respect for yourself. I'm a virgin to. I'm saving it till marriage night. So what if they make fun of you. Just blow it off and ignore them.|`|jLfH4VH1aa	no<br>  <br>  if they say it's lame tell them that it would be lame if you did something you didnt really want to do just to make other people, jackasses like themselves, happy. Why be someone you're not?|`|qxiK2rjtaa	is it lame to get crabs or herpes from all the girls you've laid?  if your answer is yes then you are a lame virgin.  otherwise who cares, nothing wrong with being a virgin especially if your still in school|`|0HOgU1TZaa	no being a virgin is not lame|`|UmNCNNNwaa	ya how old are you if your 12 or older and a virgin better get laid asap|`|b8PGkIgjaa	dude that so funny hahah<br>  im not a virgin but i still feel like one lol|`|jBQdFiXsaa	NO WAY!!! I'm 54, and still got my virginity... its good to be different, son|`|zvzjZwFnaa	nah, high schoolers that do that crap are gay anyway|`|b9fae45b6e9e49f9e502d412e0c0ae32aa	No, not at all. I think guys like that :) One lucky one will get to take it, you know what I mean?|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	NO! i am too and i'm awesome. lol :)|`|K119R72Caa	hell no!! be proud of yourself screw them|`|zHop6XNIaa	of course not!<br>  it's being clever :)|`|CVdpH2O6aa	Absolutely not, being a virgin means you have a respect for your body that those others don't.|`|lL1zNvzJaa	no its not lame at all.<br>  there just dumb dont listen to them im a virgin to and im proud of it.<br>  just dont feel bad.|`|8H97U1qDaa	aha:)<br>  same here<br>  but I'll be laughing when they catch something from<br>  somebody.|`|crbzVL0Haa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Not lame at all.<br>  <br>  Most of the kids in school are lying, too. <br>  <br>  Just so you know.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	no way<br>  <br>  dont give into peer pressure sex makes everything complicated, and yur gonna regret having sex so young|`|ZAz7SEcfaa	Being a virgin is lame if it's a burden on your life.|`|UNBswRLQaa	no you're not lame at all... so many people are giving into peer pressure and it's so smart to wait til you're married.. so don't feel lame...|`|uFznsZsmaa	they probly are virgins themselves so dont believe them<br>  and its not lame at all its safe and whats right <br>  DONT GIVE IN|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	Its not lame... funny thing is though- I bet most if not all of those kids are virgins to!  They're lame for making fun of something very stupid like that!|`|zOWgOiWHaa	For guys it is!, For girls it's better.|`|AA11485494	no its not lame being a virgin is fine it just means your not ready or havent found the one yet.. =/..|`|xXki7kt7aa	Not at all. Im in college and still one.|`|kjzfL86caa	nawh, wait 'til you're ready.<br>  <br>  it's okay, just tell the other dudes to **** off.|`|6NyBAJRgaa	nope.|`|YWAoSctPaa	absolutely not!|`|gywXHuGCaa	yes<br>  <br>  and so am i... i havent even had a first kiss... lol|`|za6zX2lsaa	No. Being a virgin is not at all lame. In fact, it's means you're smarter and tougher then everybody else around you who isn't, because they gave in and you didn't. They're making fun of you because you can always become like them (give up your virginity) but they can never become like you (regain their virginity).<br>  There's a very good reason that your head is higher up on your body than your genetalia, and that's because you're supposed to use it more often. Apparently, you are, and I hope you continue to, because no one else around you is, or they wouldn't be making fun of you.|`|DW4oZcLJaa	No it is not lame. All it means is that you're not a whore like all of those people. If you like who you are than there is no need to listen to what those people are saying.  In fact it is you who should be making fun of them.  This is what is wrong with the world today.  People think you're "lame" if you're not out there having sex with people who you don't care about. It's a dam shame nowadays.|`|LIIExwfOaa	No you are not lame! tell those kids to shut up! they don't know what they are talking about. if they make fun of you they are the ones who are immature anyways. There is no pressure wait for the right time and guy and for when you are the most comfortable to have sex! I know there is a lot of pressure out there but do what you know if right in your heart!|`|JzILM7tPaa	no! i know from personal experience that giving into what others think is "cool" will eventually hurt you in the long run! when you do find that special someone, the time will be right, but something this emotional and important should not just be tossed around.<br>  <br>  to become one of those kids, all you have to do is spend a trashy night in the back of a car, but no matter how hard they try, they can NEVER become what you are|`|ZhsquaqHaa	is nothing wrong with bring a virgin, I'm 19 and me and my girl are both virgins. Most guys that brag about their sexual experiences are lairs, its all BS. And no I'm not a nerdy kid, i play Football, Soccer for my collage team, u know, its nothing wrong with staying away form sex, i have a healthy relationship with my girl and No sex is necessary. So keep your chin up, and don't worry what people say, they are all just lairs. hoped i helped!! :)|`|StHedcXtaa	no im a virgin and im totally awesomely cool, but that is probably because im fun and so hott lol. Everyone loves me. just kidding,but seriosly im a virgin and ill be one till im married.|`|Y5pbYWMQaa	No, being a virgin isn't lame. it is your choice if you are or aren't.about the kids at school just try to ignore them. by the way i am a virgin to and people make fun of me, but u shouldn't care what other people think of u. good luck!|`|XU1fftrMaa	No! I'm a virgin and I hang out with many people that aren't virgins. But.. some people these days think it is uncool to be a virgin cause most people aren't. But.. no your not a lame. Your doing the right thing by being a virgin.|`|b27e1f009a138f21b2e5b21b3de95b56aa	No :)|`|yGfmofHUaa	no it's smart|`|EXM1nHNFaa	No, you are in no way lame. The problem is the value of being a virgin has all been lost in this new society.|`|FuEa92ydaa	Don't listen to them it's awesome. when they're all pregnant at 16 you'll have an awesome unrestrained life ahead of you. You are the wiser.|`|soNHKzK2aa	no. Theres plenty of time for sex! And whoever you end up with later in life will probably respect you for not whoring yourself out in your school days, nobody likes to hear their partners been with loads of people!|`|g2FAEj6Taa	Being a virgin is staying true and its not lame at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Plus girls don't like man whores  and don't put your self under peer pressure.
3vToYNA2aa	If he is not making any moves he might love you but not enough.I'm sure he cares about you and the reason why he tells you he loves you because he wants to keep you around and make sure you won't move on. I would try to move on and see if he makes any move.If not I think you are just wasting your time :-(
DrXWucWpaa	Awww:)   no thats not cheesy at all, that is very sweet of you and she'll just love it.  She wont be able to get you out of her head, thinking about how much she loves you and how caring you really are.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	no i think its adorable. and also what would be cute was one day when u dont have work or anything and you know shes home suprise her and stop by. ring her doorbell and leave roses at her doorstep. when she picks them up come from the side. i wish my bf would do that haha|`|ejkICVlEaa	thats not cheesy!! thats so sweet!!! and romantic!!! she'll love it.|`|noGTQvFYaa	no i would love that ... anything helps|`|tWvM6M0raa	that is cute and romantic<br>  <br>  although it depends on how long you have been together, if it's not long then it could be a bit odd<br>  if you have been together a while then do it|`|oE1eCjRtaa	AWWW! that's lovely! <br>  Not cheesy at all, i would be dead happy if my boyfriend sent me roses to my workplace, however make sure you send them on a day that she is definatly working.|`|skFguzQWaa	she will love this it will let her know you are thinking about her and that you miss her go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2lim0SHvaa	It would be much less cheesy if you just sent me the flowers. Roses are nice. Thanks.|`|cezaZQQsaa	WHIPPED!|`|YgGi07Rpaa	That is not cheesy at all!|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	that's a nice idea yes to her work and roses are nice but don't do red. red is over done try pink or yellow or a variety|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	cute!! I like it|`|NvgowkZzaa	Well it's not that it's really cheesy, but it's just not original. If you really wanted to surprise her and do something special, I would drive to visit her. (If it's possible.) If you went and visited her it would show her how much you miss her, that you couldn't wait to see her, and have something planned for you guys to do.|`|X6ipvO1xaa	im not exactly sure how she would see it as, but if i got flowers from my bf that i havent seen for a while i would have thought it was romantic.|`|s7us9819aa	That is sooooo romantic... <br>  <br>  My boyfriend had flowers delivered to my house once but I wasn't there to get them lol<br>  ....he was really disapointed<br>  <br>  I think that idea is really sweet tho, not cheesy at all..she will love it :D|`|O5fp5485aa	dude, take a sick day from work, and just show up yourself with flowers. that's what makes the difference|`|8G0PhjlPaa	that is cute its def not cheesy. im sure any girl would really think that is sweet and appreciate it.|`|m3qmDfXTaa	not cheesy at all! she will know that you are thinking of her :) and that will probably make her week. I'd say roses and a mushy card.. lol|`|h22Lp0DSaa	VERY cutee!! do it fer suree|`|Qa6dFF4Eaa	i think it's sooo sweet!|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Why would you think getting flowers delivered to her work is cheesy ?<br>  Its nice and I'm sure will pleasantly surprise her.<br>  <br>  Then again I'm a guy what do I know about females|`|o8uGsZxmaa	Thats sooooo cute! =D
lbmFZkDSaa	wowzers. he's "fingered" you and you don't know if he likes you?<br>  it's quite obvious that if it isn't love it's LUST. & trust me it's not love.<br>  <br>  wow. =O|`|fC8OPOTkaa	he might be after a 'booty call'.<br>  <br>  :) X|`|690MZg0Xaa	Hes fingered u..........my God...

QGv8ngfeaa	*your<br>  <br>  Listen, sometimes when you feel that was, it's kinda true.<br>  I don't mean that you actually are, but maybe in your circle of friends, in your network of people in school, home, work, whatever... You're just not fitting in.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you- i always feel that way. I'm a super sensitive person, and often time people think I overreact or I search for things that aren't there. I don't think I do. I think I just don't let people get away with any stupid act of slander they want, and they don't like it. Just because I'm bias and sensitive, doesn't mean I'm not right, you know?<br>  <br>  And I always feel like my wheel of fortune never changes. I never get a break. Even if small good things happen to me, it's always just a preparation for something really bad to go wrong. It's come to the point where I'll get a really bad piece of news and just sigh... because what else was I expecting? It's something I learned to accept... and people think I'm crazy. But one friend I had who I told this too... she cam to me one day and said  "wow... you're right. You never get a break, every day its something new."<br>  <br>  Anyways- you're not the only one, but you're one of few. does that help at all?<br>  <br>  Probably not. <br>  :\<br>  <br>  I'm sorry.<br>  Don't let someone tell you that it's just your perspective. Sometimes you give and you try and you smile and you care and you have all the good intentions, and you still get fucked.<br>  <br>  Ps- my current Drama? I'm a straight A student in a really good school, but I cant afford it. I have done everything humanly possible to stay in the school, all efforts on my part have been made in full. God just hates me I think. He's like- "oh, you managed to do  something good for yourself? Nope, sorry! No money for you. Haha. No school."<br>  <br>  Lol.
rGMv0AMtaa	Of course!<br>  <br>  Age really doesn't matter, as long as shes funny, cute, healthy, active, and has a great personality!|`|Ozggv2xLaa	well im 17 finta be 18 and imma gurl and i would date a 23-27 year old BOY...........they be havin them long johns but ummmmmmmm. go_duke got a gurl lol|`|deebXXoHaa	mmmmm, 18 year old *****, DA BEST!|`|B97UyW0Faa	yes|`|AjtfapXBaa	if she hot big **** is good and a nice as watch the face though|`|e312057036f561246eab81f1f027343caa	hell yeahhhh.. im only 17 tho|`|u8eHTkWDaa	Yeah, i don't see why it would be a problem|`|CNJyyYIpaa	yes|`|o3d3NBVzaa	Maybe. She'd obviously have to be attractive. But I wouldn't date her for anything like marriage in mind.
VkVyuq5baa	It's okay your question isn't so bad in relative comparison. The one below you asked "What is the length of an average penis". With regards to your question... I have no idea what her problem is, but oh boyo she has a problem.|`|psMZrXa7aa	˙u???l?? ? ???? ?,us?op ??s<br>  ˙?uo q?np ? s,???? os ???su? ?u??s????u? u? ?o ?u??? ?,u?? ?|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Perhaps she wants to try being a necrophiliac an needs your help ;-)|`|AA12135516	What a dumb a**, maybe she's kinky & wants your misses to beat her up. who knows?|`|PV9YFZNmaa	she might just like younger men or something|`|ZEwAalKPaa	She is either a nympho or needs her eyes tested.|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	she's obviously not getting any and maybe getting the wrong signals from you. try scratching your balls every time you see her. this may put her off. if not, drop your trousers and take a dump on her lawn,this will probably do the trick.
kX2OWqP7aa	Well it is possible that his trip took longer than expected and his homework does need to be done.  With that being said, he knew about his homework and chores in advance, so that shouldn't be an excuse.  You need to let him know just how much this upsets you and how it makes you feel.  <br>  I would feel very frustrated and would want to clear this up before we did anything else.|`|F1v6ynxiaa	well it first depends on how old you and your bf are. if your in your young teens i wouldnt be so up tight about it. especially if you want him to stay around. he maybe had some stuff to do . give him a lil space and then figure it out when you see him next. dont push him away.|`|PixwhRR1aa	ur a loser<br>  ur beasting 4 no reason<br>  he has a life too, and was <br>  probably busy!|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Lily you need to relax, your boyfriend has a life too.|`|nVdYIHhzaa	he probably just got hung up. i can't tell you how many times i've been an hour late to my gfs house because on my way out the door my mom comes up with something like "oh before you go why don't you......" and sometimes i just don't make it at all.
b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Sure everything is possible in the fantasy world of computers. On here everyone can be exactly as they wish they really were in the real world, and no one would ever know the difference. But with that said, even criminals or people with criminal intentions can make themselves out to be Prnce Charming everytime and so some unexpected damsel in distress desperately seeking a Prince Charming somewhere finds this so called "perfect" gentleman on here and a whirl wind romance begins. he says everything on here that he knows she wants to hear and before she knows it, shes caught in his web of deceit, and hooked not knowing she just has hooked up with a sexual predator who really cares not who he catches. Remember the saying about "not all is as it appears sometimes", is a very good warning on here.Trust ones gut and not heart as it will lie to you, so yes people fall in love on here but please make sure who youre really dealing with before actually meeting this person. Never ever give out any personal info on here and if after all this one still wants to meet their possible Prince Charming, meet him/her in a public place first with a friend or someone near by just in case. The worst thing on here is you have no way of ever verifying just who youre falling for.  Also picture are just that pictures and could be of anyone. Sorry got side tracked here but hopefully anyone pondering meeting someone on line and happens to read your answers learns something from here. Ive already had to deal with some women who had problems meeting someone on line in person, but also have knownquite a few success stories too. Thank you for asking such an important question and letting me kinda vent here|`|58ojIirQaa	its possible i mean i have talk to guys online and ended up liking them but never got the chance to meet them. but in the end even if u do fall in love with that person u have to meet them in person. online webcam and picture sending wont give u much pleasure. it would be more fun and fulfilling if u got to sit down face to face and talk to them and be able to kiss them like a real couple|`|RUD2N3Sqaa	first off yes you can fall in love with someone that has alot in common with u and likes u stuff but 90% of long distance relationships always end in a break up sooner or later and its not worth falling in love in the first place online unless they live close to u for example lets say u fell in love wit her and she only lives a couple hour drive away from u , but if shes from another state or country its just not worth it trust me iv had 3 long distance relationships and thev all ended in nothing , so its just not worth givning up ur intimacy to a stranger trust me ur better of with a gurl in ur school or job trust me dont suffer like i did goodluck|`|796ebff69bb72b376ff6d95a86aa3a65aa	i think so if they are telling the truth then you are getting to know there personality and that is what should attract people the personality.|`|HtKKcq98aa	It is a bit strange i agree. I would meet the person first and hang out with them a few times before i made any commitments|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	it is possible for some people i guess, but its not the safest way to fall in love and i don't think anyone can really fall in love on line because they still don't know everything about the person, even if they think they do.
Wy0lUjP9aa	Catch his attention. Say "hi" when you walk by him. Try to make sure that his others aren't around because they may think you are talking to them. lol. When you say hi, flash a pretty smile. Practice in the mirror to do so. Then he will talk to you more. You have to catch his attention in any way you can. Don't show off or anything because that will be a turn off.|`|2tn8EALqaa	are you 12???
E23s2wSNaa	cause he is a big baby, he should tell u to stop, hes letting u be his mom, if he has a mom, send him to her for ur sakes|`|UxRoUTvCaa	Maybe he acts like a baby?|`|mefxIQP9aa	Because he lets you treat him like one.
89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	No you're not a bad person! If anything you're a better person for, one, caring about the children and their development, and two, actually putting up with her even though you know the type of person she is. None of this is your fault. She doesn't do drugs because of you, she doesn't sleep around with other guys because of you. You are a good person. End of discussion.|`|ecbezqbjaa	i really don't think so <br>  it's her fault she and him ain't together<br>  not yours right? cause if it was your fault then, yes your bad|`|F2Tcrpqpaa	NO you're not a bad person. dont put urself dwn|`|hz6Lo0wraa	No, you are not a bad person. I think that if you sincerely feel wrong about the situation (which it does not sound like) then you might want to talk things over with her. However, I would just say everyone has their past, and we must respect them for such a past, move on and enjoy the present.|`|hi2nQNXsaa	sorry ,but she was never your friend.i realize things happen ,but if you were really friends no matter what you would have said "i just can't even look at you like that."you say your friend is slutty it looks like birds of a feather flock together.|`|g2JlIuRcaa	wow thats cool
TDUcM2Bvaa	well yea you get to "keep the title" but if you're a girl that says you're waiting till marriage to have sex but you go suck off every guy you see, you may technically be a virgin but you're still a whore.<br>  <br>  *not you poster I mean any girl|`|6wTfRlhlaa	yes. it really is common, but the reason why people do it is because your still a virgin.<br>  girls finger themselves... that doesnt make them not a virgin,<br>  and same thing goes for when guys to it to girls.<br>  it's all for keeping a title
Wy0lUjP9aa	Well you may not make yourself look interested. When you stand somewhere, do you cross your arms or when guys look at you do you try to ignore them at all cost? You can't make yourself look uninterested. Body language is everything when it comes to meeting new people, whether it is dating or just meeting new friends. <a href="http://www.astrostar.com/How-To-Attract-Men.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrostar.com/How-To-Attract-...</a>|`|vEzWG1eNaa	Well i bet ur very pretty so it cant be that.<br>  try talking to them about boy stuff.<br>  or stay after in like a boys class<br>  such as tech or wood shop <br>  <br>  be more talkitive with boys.<br>  just not to talkitive<br>  they might think ur specail haha<br>  good luck!
coZ7Fm79aa	i sang to her..in front of many people i told everyone to shut up i had something important to say got on one knee grabbed the girls hand and sung "I DONT WANNA MISS ONEE SMILLEEEE I DONT WANNA MISSS ONE KISSS" went on for like 30 secs then asked her out..it was interesting lol....she said yes though if she said no that'd be like a c.ock slap to the face|`|JJCSEe3Taa	Haha actually I haven't done anything embarrassing, if I need to make an effort to impress a girl that much then they can **** off to be honest.
s9cT6yJIaa	Yeah, I used to be the same way, now all I do is everyday from school, I stop thinking about that and meditate. That keeps my mind off of it. If you want, just calm your mucles down and keep your mind on somthing else. Before the day you go to school, watch a movie.
9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	It sounds like he may have a thing for you girlie!!|`|AA11447210	We can't read his mind. We can't know if he likes you any better than you can.|`|x9MhuJg4aa	yes|`|vPkQpNQHaa	i think he wants to flirt and find out more about you<br>  because he's interested and maybe like you<br>  but he's DEFNIATELY interested|`|c9af35cc3223b9cb9768bf1cf1bf4ac7aa	I think he does :-)|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	no he doesnt.|`|x9FienLUaa	uh, yeah!!|`|fziUwZWTaa	He likes you alot. I would say that you should probably take it slow, but be sure to ask him if he does like you. Does he live far away. If so, I would'nt really want to get close, as it will be likely that you will get hurt in the end, but if you live closer and can see eachother more often than two monthes, I would say go for it. it is very clear that he likes you.|`|2oEXqAb0aa	"Redneck"???  -- be careful, they are a plenty here and will "use" you.<br>  <br>  If he is sincere, then go for it.<br>  <br>  Keep the Texts and Conversations going, and then decide, "Is this the guy, or not?"<br>  <br>  Best of luck to You.<br>  <br>  M|`|vLc2RyxIaa	Yes he does haha. Any guy that would say that definitely does. He might say it jokingly but humor is a way that can show your true feelings and make the other person possibly laugh. Yes he likes you. :D|`|9Ig4jyT7aa	He probably does.  But flirt back some and see how he reacts.|`|C4fnSiTkaa	hekc yeah|`|UHg5wZ8jaa	crush|`|pxvmrNG6aa	yes of course, unless he flirts with all grls
zhsTxqGxaa	Just say what your heart feels.  If you want to date her then that is totally fine.  I live in a society where races of all kind are accepted so I don't see why not.  Just because she's black and your white doesn't mean you two can't date.  Love between a white person and a black person HAS happened before.  Tell your parents to stop being racist and let you date her.  Racist behavior is ridiculous and it should never be tolerated.  It's your decision not theirs.  If your friends are making racist comments, stand up for her and yourself by fighting with words.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Either let other people rule your life or do what you want to do. I've dated white guys before and pretty much got hated on by every black person I knew (never told my parents tho which I feel like a chump for). But I'm glad I did what I wanted to not what other people wanted me to.After a while it didnt bother me anymore and actually started to get pretty funny.|`|NEhVHPSTaa	POPULARITY IS SOOOO IMPORTANT<br>  <br>  Don't be such a d.ick and just ask her out.|`|W6o3UQLkaa	stand up for her|`|uklX2rOMaa	you should go for it and do it behind your parents back they don't have to know everything that's going on in your life and just because she's black doesn't mean anything. if ur friends make fun of you then they are not really your friends. Don't worry your real friends will stick by your side :)|`|piuEx0BJaa	if you like her date her don't be influenced to date someone else by the people around you. cause not taking this chance you might end up regretting it and if you give in to the peer pressure you will just be another shallow popular dick|`|1vZ1n0agaa	you know exactly what everyone here is going to say
aY6EjDwjaa	he probably likes you<br>  dont officially ask him, just make a slight move subtly while you're out.<br>  its better that way.<br>  just be smooth B-) like barry white XD|`|1M47JWfvaa	haha, the way you twisted it was a good idea!<br>  aww, hun, if he doesn't like you, then it's his loss! idk, guys confuse me too! just be yourself; don't try to impress a guy.<br>  <br>  hope i helped and good luck! :)|`|bp0SbC44aa	You can't change peoples minds, well sometimes you can but when it comes to this, You can't and lets just stick with that. If this guy doesn't like you then thats ok, other guys do, I'm sure of it. If your heart is set on this guy then just be yourself, he'll like you for who you are, and if you guys aren't meant to be, then understand it when God sends you the message that he isn't your soulmate.|`|2kHQ3Icnaa	He feels pressured.
Yh9Zbz9Taa	when u guys are walking next to each other<br>  just open up ur hand and see if she takes it|`|p8otQ2vuaa	if you are a little far from her offer your hand.<br>  usually you can start doing this when you two are walking together.<br>  but if you are walking beside her, well then hold her hand. just like that<br>  do it casually not aggressively|`|OSSRoUs2aa	Well just come out and ask her... Would you like to hold hands  and see what she says!<br>  Good Luck!
e554859be7f71724a74225ed1b3e50f3aa	Need more details, hun.<br>  First of all, did you bleed after having sex with Mr XL?<br>  Second of all, does this new guy have sex in a more rampant way? Example, does he try harder or go faster?<br>  If it's painful it might be best to go see a doctor as sometimes parts can rip or tear during a particularly hard/fast session.<br>  However if it's not too painful would still recommend the doctor as you could have an infection or problem down there. Very important to get this checked out.<br>  Hope this helps xx|`|5SyjY5RNaa	i'm not sure why that would happen.  maybe see a doctor?<br>  <br>  could you help me please with one of mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlhSwn5rS50_bfWOx872_ULsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222141343AAYF87n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|aiRn2lQGaa	i would go check with a doctor

cFd00priaa	When you see the other person and realize that you couldn't take a single breath if they weren't there; when you realize that you want to spend the rest of your life with that person, starting now.|`|ACNECiZAaa	You realize that the greatest reason to be alive is to be around that person. You realize that you would do anything in your power to make them happy. True love makes you selfless, giving, takes your breath away, and gives you this feeling inside that is pretty much indescribable.
TthDWtPTaa	FATima asked you if she was fat?<br>  LMAO!
uRjpO45kaa	LMAOO to your 'additional details'<br>  <br>  well im a girl who does E's every now and then, my friends and I agree that it makes you be all touchy and lovey duvy.<br>  <br>  You want to be close to people, it feels amazing just being touched so Yes to your answer, E's does make us wanna have sex. Your more open to new ideas and think nothing can go wrong so its more likely that a girl will go home with a random guy that she just met as opposed to meeting him while just drinking alcohol (unless shes some slut) :-P<br>  <br>  Also seeing that people take it at raves/clubs etc - once its finished your still rolling and full of energy even after hours of dancing, so another good way to release your energy- sex<br>  <br>  You probably know this but 99% of girls/guys look grose when their high, just the eyes freak you out (unless your on it too)|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	You'd be a moron to do that to someone, and hopefully it will loosen their fist to punch you out when they find out you drugged them for sex.|`|x7QjeAtlaa	k, to answer youre question: no.<br>  used to do the ****,<br>  never made me horny or anything like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  but then again you see people at raves all up on eachother.<br>  so i guess it could be like beer goggles? hahah.|`|VKbSyF2oaa	You could go to jail for this. I don't know what you were thinking when you asked this...|`|yqFz7ig2aa	so your saying your so ugly and your equipment is so small that only a drugged up women would have sex with you.<br>  <br>  please get a life.|`|FTG6M0Luaa	Are you really asking this question?|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Drugging someone = you go to prison.|`|fC8OPOTkaa	that is so degrading.

WekPVVfVaa	Don't get a new boyfriend just to make him jealous, because that would be using him. Just make sure you look your best, and dont act like you want him back! Make sure you dont plead or grovel or anything, just move on and he'll want you back! :)|`|VSXUa9lraa	Get another boyfriend, and brag about he great he is- but don't lie about this boyfriend because he'll find out and think you're pathetic.<br>  M ex found out I had a boyfriend and suddenly wanted me back and I pushed him away.|`|WuaWstFdaa	Dont even think twice about it !!!!  move on , never ever grovel or ask him back!!!

YSRhBfmDaa	It is said that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, but wanting to wear the same shirt is a bit much. <br>  She might be feeling a little insecure about your friendship for some reason.  <br>  Have you recently become friends with some other girls (or boys)? <br>  If so, she might be wanting to wear the same shirt as you to let everyone know that you and her are best friends.  <br>  Tell her that some of the things you like most about her is her individuality and creativity, and that wearing the same shirt would not allow either of you to express your unique personalities.|`|AA11728816	if you dont want to then dont. if she is your real friend then she wont care...she will understand and care about your feelings about tht....plus that kinda embarrasing to wear the same shirt on the same day especially if you will be seen together a bunch|`|hOHrNeL7aa	Tell her to just wear the same color shirt as you.

If she is a good friend, she would understand.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	TELL HER you dont want to. relationships often strain when one is not honest with the other. tell her you dont like the idea, that you love her, but that you like to be an individual. being YOU is very important.|`|9O0pzIZAaa	Just say you don't want to. Hopefully she'll understand.|`|gJNxfoJHaa	just tell your best friend you dont want to<br>  <br>  she would understand :)<br>  just make sure you explain to her why.|`|1PqbJzsnaa	just tell her you really don't want to do it.
TthDWtPTaa	stay away from her
8FbOtXAXaa	It sounds like you are very attached to him and you are afraid that he is going somewhere or going to leave you. These issues might stem from childhood if you were in a situation where someone that you loved left like your mom or dad left the picture and it hurt you so bad that now that you have a boyfriend you are afraid of experiencing the same kind of loss. You sound like you are very dependent on him which means you need him to make you happy. When you need a person to make you happy there might be a problem there because you should be able to be happy with yourself. Sorry if I am rambling but I think that you just really like him and he brings joy to your life and you need it to go throughout your day and when you don't have it you get all anxious and need him to be there. Just try to keep yourself occupied if you can't see him for a few days.|`|spWtg1Cmaa	Take it down a notch! You are smothering him with your love. I sometimes feel this way but only if my boyfriend and I haven't talked in days. You just need something to do to occupy all your spare time. I would get a job. Whenever I'm working I don't think of my boyfriend, or anything else honestly.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	It is called love struck.  You never get over it.

zxQT3Uo5aa	Nothing is wrong with that.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	No, as long as they don't do anything that involves sexual contact.|`|8KMY4eZYaa	In the eyes of the law he is jail bait but when she is 23 and he is 21 it will no longer matter.|`|yhT2VuUVaa	As long as the 18 years old parents accept them dating|`|1PqbJzsnaa	she could get arrested if they become intimate...maybe they're just holding hands.  yea, i'm sure that's what it's about.
9vckO6Cbaa	I would suggest white sheets. They hide it fairly well. Try not to buy a pure white, but more of an off creamy white.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, buy a good reliable stain remover.|`|wZuBbA2Xaa	dark colors, cotton...use the shout gel
gT6tpcbbaa	1 is prettier               i hate face peircings on girls|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Girl number 1|`|SPh4ctPCaa	Girl one :-)|`|458068558a4cf700faa83ad8aabe68beaa	I think there is not enough information. I mean there are different situations for both. If the girl that is shy still got this guys attention some how and then became comfortable with him so she was able to open up to him then that is the best pick. On the other hand if the girl that is out going was also good hearted then it is a tie. In either case they are both good options, they just have to find the right guy for their conditions... if that makes any sense at all. Sorry it makes sense in my mind but I'm having a hard time putting it on the screen! Bottom line is there is someone for everyone, and that doesn't mean there is only one person out there for everyone but there is a certain type of person out there for everyone, you just need to find that type of person. Look hard enough and you will.|`|0VLirxVtaa	I think they are both very pretty. But I also think that girl 2 would be prettier if she took the ring out. But overall, the 2nd girl is prettier.|`|wr0sk5oeaa	girl 1|`|TwuwpisJaa	by the pics i think both are very prtty.I have alot of these things with in me also.|`|rJkgtZ3Paa	2|`|PhivaI6Oaa	theyre both good

Wy0lUjP9aa	Just say it. Men like confidence. You don't need to ask him out, but when you two are talking. Say 'I like you a lot" and then smile. He may even ask you out! Just try it, hey, even if he says no it is better than not saying anything at all and watching him go out with someone else.
g3PnLUYfaa	i'm in the same situation. well kinda. my would be bf likes me and i like him too. but his best friends ALSO like me so he won't go out with me... all i know is that guys are twisted, and rely too much on their best friends. Hang in there.. he'll come around|`|MWjNp6y3aa	You will never know until you go for it. Don't worry, even if he is playing you you will have a good time and then life will go on with someone else. Don't worry so much. You are a woman. Isn't that hard for you girls is it? I never see single girls out and about.
buHzPMHZaa	It means that the writer is an innocent kid who has no idea what life is like. I wouldn't dwell on it.
2S2onP86aa	Skinny and tall, supermodel. You are what he likes, trust me. And be confident. <br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|weBvwrloaa	most important, you have to be happy with yourself. If you doubt yourself then it will show through. He is obviously into you or it wouldn't even be heading in that direction.

Do it a lot until you get comfortable with it. It doesn't really matter about him, because you can always say I'm not ready. If you're going out with him then he probably likes how you look and would rather look at you with your clothes off so don't be worried. He likes you, but be sure to wear condom(or tell him to) because you don't want to get pregnant on your first go around. By the way I'm still a virgin, and I'm waiting until I find the right person, be sure that he's the right person. That you're going to have sex with him because he loves you and you him. Not just because he has a nice body or anything materialistic like that. Good luck on your first time.|`|RVxI2cR5aa	sounds JUST LIKE ME about... ehh on feb. 7th well lets just say im about 5'6 134 average size for  a 15 year old. i use to hate my body then once i had sex with my boyfriend i felt like i could just walk around naked. but with the whole nervous of what he thinks, dont be if he cares about you enought he shouldnt care what your body looks like:]|`|eUn1U8j9aa	If you're unsure what he will think, don't do it because you aren't ready.

Now even if you can lose a few pounds (which most of us can) it doesn't matter.   Just act confident about your body and focus on the good things about it.<br>  <br>  That will make him focus on those things too and make him more into you.   remember everybody has something about their body that they don't like, just focus on what you do like.|`|1BPnF0QSaa	Massage can help body image by giving you tactile feedback on how your body really is.

And anyone who knows about him make sure they know not to say a word about him around your dad. And you should be good.|`|9jNsEAFGaa	tell your boyfriend.

Invite a few of your friends that you are comfortable with and tell her to do the same.  The easiest way IMO to start a relationship is if you both are already friends first.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Make a firm date and go for a very funny film (not sexual or violent), no alcohol and lots of popcorn to chomp on.

ibFTUi1taa	Yes, he likes you and you totally have a chance! <br>  Sure, he didn't kiss or ask you out, but it was the first date. He is outgoing from what I can tell, but not that outgoing. If anything it's a good sign that he didn't kiss you right away because it may mean that he isn't just going to use you for sex. <br>  He likes you. It's easy to tell. You two had a fun time and with time your relationship should change to be something even better.<br>  =)|`|5EWmu0M8aa	He absolutely likes you.

Don't be nervous - talk like these are your old friends.|`|bMk6xZaSaa	haha. I was the new kid 10 times. (My parents are in the military). Don't worry, just start talking with people and ask them questions about themselves and they'll ask you back. You find something in common and boom!  Some even better advice is join a club or sports team.  Do something you like and there will be common ground there as well.  No worries!

She obviously doesn't know what she wants out of life right now.<br>  It sounds as if you are ready to settle down a bit more than she will be for a long time. Please state how old you are. Are you currently receiving an education? If not, that is probably why you are more willing to settle down with one person.<br>  In such a case, you must remember that you do want to move on with other girls. With this motivation, search for a girl who is as able to commit as you are. Someone who is not sure of large areas of her life is not ready for you.<br>  In conclusion, don't believe that you're not good enough for her.

I think making it three years long distance is pretty darn good to be honest.  Most of the time 6 months to a year is as long as one can hold up without beginning to take major damage.<br>  <br>  Cheating is hard to resist when you are getting absolutely no physical attention from your boyfriend / girlfriend.<br>  <br>  If she was apologetic for what happened, and assures you that it wouldn't happen again I think you guys could have a good chance at a relationship since she is moving to your state.  Seeing each other more would help with the cheating.  But in the same state could still be long distance.  I'd say if she was honestly apologetic and she is moving within 30 minutes from you you should try it with her.<br>  <br>  If she wasn't sorry, or if she is over 2 hours away... I'd probably just move on.  Don't try to be her friend, it's impossible to be just friends after having such strong feelings I think.|`|xpZoXcF6aa	u can still be friends with her, and things happen for a reason, we as human worry about things we have no control over, it is in your best interest to leave your love life in the hands of God, he knows whats best for you, we always seem to have the deepest feelings for those who could care less about us, just know that if it is God's will for you guys to be together then no man on earth could change this, besides you guys are still  pretty young so live your life cus when the time comes you would probably wish you were still single<br>  Sincerly, <br>  * Dr. Diva*
EdDLydH7aa	Ohhh hon, sex is so colplicated even if you 86, it's very emotional and some people just aren't emotional ready to deal with it, if you are wanting to wait until marraige then wait, we're all human and have needs, but it's all physical, when you start feeling all hot and bothered go work out or do something other than all that kissing and stuff , whatever you guys are doing, it's worth waiting until you feel like your ready...there are some many things that you have to be worried about, not just you but all of us at any age-un wanted pregnancy, std's, emotional stress, it's not all bad, but it's better when you are ready, good luck and only you can make that decision, not him, it's your body|`|YB0piA3raa	do you believe strongly enough in sex after marraige to wait till then? if so then you should continue with it if your boy friends loves you and cares about you he will respect your decision either way you need to make sure that you are ready to have sex and if you are and you feel ok about it all and you have both talked about it then go for it but until then stick to what you think is best <br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|SmHaeishaa	If you feel ready to have sex then do it but if you dont then say to your boyfriend that you are not ready and if he loves you e will wait.

VQs0adT8aa	First of all:  Getting married while in college rarely works out for finishing college.  I've known 6 different girls (rather closely, more than that if I count friends-of-friends) who married before finishing their degree.  Only one actually finished her degree, and it took her two extra years, including two extra years of student loans.  If education is important to both of you, and if he truly loves you, he will let you devote yourself to finishing school BEFORE you get married.  If he's pressuring you, that's not love.<br>  <br>  Second:  I've done long-distance twice.  In both occasions, we dated in-person first and then one of us moved, making it long distance.  I say this so you know I'm not speaking in hypotheticals, but from actual experience.  If the relationship is truly healthy, the long-distance only makes it stronger (my husband and I grew WAY closer during the year of our dating that was long-distance).  If the relationship has any problems, the distance will show it to you.  If your relationship doesn't survive the distance, it means you guys didn't have what it takes to overcome struggles together and you should be grateful that the distance shows this to you before you commit your life to it.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying the distance will be easy.  It never is.  (But your GA to NC would put you guys closer to each other than me and my then-boyfriend.)  <br>  <br>  I could add a third point about marrying too quickly/too young, but I won't toy with your emotions by trying to trivialize them that way.<br>  <br>  The real point is this:  If you do get married just to be together, you're risking making a rash decision (marriage is about much much much much more than just living together) and putting your education and future at serious risk as well.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, deciding to keep going as is, your benefits are as follows:  The distance could strengthen your relationship more than many other things you might face in life together.  You get to finish school for sure.  You both have time to mature as individuals and as a couple and work out the big issues of marriage before you get to that point.<br>  <br>  -----Please consider the above to be impersonal and polite advice.  What follows below is more rude and specific to your case, and I do hope you can consider it carefully and logically without letting your emotions blind you.  If you're too offended by what I'm about to say, please just disregard it and only consider the earlier points above.-----<br>  <br>  The thing that worries me most is that you think you have only two choices:  Stay and don't marry, or Move and marry.  You have a third you didn't mention at all.  You could transfer to a closer school and still NOT get married.  The fact that you jump straight to considering marriage is an enormous red flag that your maturity level is just absolutely not ready to put a successful marriage together.  If you were my daughter I would be terrified that you were about to make an adult decision for childish reasons.  I would want to forbid it.  I would encourage you to transfer schools if you thought you absolutely had to, but there is NO REASON that you have to marry just to be closer.  NONE WHATSOEVER.  Marriage HAS TO be based on so much more than just a desire to be together, and if you think that love alone is all you need, you simply are not ready to make that step.<br>  <br>  I've also seen a rash of people getting married much earlier than they normally would when the military is involved.  Dealing with deployment or possible deployment or returning from deployment seems to change the way that people process their emotions and prioritize things like relationships.  However, most of the young military marriages I've seen are no more successful than those made a few years later by those without military involvement.  In fact, they're often more fraught by interpersonal problems and relationship flaws than people who didn't let military issues precipitate their actions.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	tough, thing is that what is the chance of him being redeployed to anywhere else, you transfer up there, then suddenly he get orders, what is the chance of that??? but  when you make that move make sure he will be there for awhile at least unitl you finish school. good luck I was in a relationship when I was in the army i got orders to ge alot different places and gone for months, well it didnt last for us.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	I would wait another year.  Just have a long engagement.  If the relationship is strong, then it will last.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I would say 'Yes'.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Before getting into marriage you have to be 100% sure. You have some doubts so my serious suggestion is that you wait. Before you marry you should complete school and any other goals. If you  don't then in future you may grow to resent your husband and blame him for you not going ahead to achieve your goals.
ZNzu6gClaa	Of course, there is always the possibility that a person will cheat in a relationship. The only way you can know for sure if your partner is faithful is to stalk them every minute of the day, but if you go about doing that, you can't expect the relationship to last very long!<br>  <br>  But, in the end, it all comes down to trust. There can be no relationship if there is no trust.<br>  <br>  Please answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhBS9xl.sfXrUNhZErMubWXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222152136AALZYFk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
03GQ637Raa	It seems to me your friend is acting like he is guilty of something.  When he acts funny when this girl is around something smells fishy about his actions.  I think he wants his cake and wants to eat it to.  Why not try acting the way he is acting towards him and see what happens.  When a guy starts giving you lame excuses for not calling or seeing you than that is something you need to address to him the next time you see or talk to him.  It might just be best if you could just move on and stop wasting your time with this jerk.  Believe me, there will be someone else that will come into your life that will appreciate you|`|0U25Ymqtaa	well i wouldnt do that<br>  i think he is just a flirt n his femal friend is his gf n he doesnt talk to u cuz he afriad that u might say sumthing to get his girl mad at him cuz he flirts wit u
vR7Bew2Xaa	There's no actual way to stop liking someone.<br>  It takes time, but you should know that its not worth being so upset about. What's done is done and there's no reason to still feel bad about it.<br>  Its the past, and its time to move on.<br>  To find new people to hang out with, and such.<br>  But if you really can't all you can do is give it time, but don't sit around crying about it, because its not worth all the pain. Its just one person, and you'll have a lot more relationships to get over the older you get and the more people you meet. You have to know how to get over someone or after a while you'll be like this after every break up|`|eyGAytOTaa	Its all right if you cant stop thinking about him. If you cant move on, then dont move on. You will eventually get over it with the passage of time. Time heals every wound. You dont need to look for another guy to distract yourself because you dont want to spend your with any nerdy, weirdo that comes on your way. Just go by your day as you usually did and soon you will realize that today is a brand new day and so you are a brand new girl, available and is waiting for someone much much better to come down your way and sweep you off your feet.

Doing them both at same time, like meeting other lads & doing stuff with other lads, it helps you forget about him, but it will be hard if you see him at school & stuff.<br>  This is what i tend to do when i brake up with a lad.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	After my ex wife left nothing could help me. Then I tried drinking. That didn't work either. I tried playing video games to drown it out. Only thing to drown it out for me was to dance a ton at the clubs around here with the loud loud speakers to drown out all thoughts of anything that bothers me. Even helps with stress from work. If you can play tons of sports or anything very physical and mentally challenging. Basically anything that shoves out thoughts from your head. It is great. Now I am happy. Happy just to be myself. It helps with relationships to be happy for yourself.|`|x1UrTbjnaa	if it's that much of a problem maybe you should be free for a while.

I need to know how to move on.  I don't think it's a matter of you just finding a guy, I think it's probably more than that.  When you like someone, it typically doesn't go away.  There is no magic that makes it disappear.  You need to just give it time and if nothing changes, then maybe this guy is the one you should be going out with.  That's how I think of my own situation.|`|5wKHjEK3aa	no dont go out and just have sex.. you are a women, so have good respect for your self and the other women out there.

It is sooooo hard. You never really get over it completely, you just learn to live with it. It's okay to just be single for a while and try to figure out what you want in a relationship. He has already moved on though, this situation isn't fixable. Cut off all communication with him and just stay away from him. Try to only think of the bad things he did, the bad qualities about him. Most likely he will just hurt his current girl like he did you and continue on in a path like that. It's hard but you will eventually start to feel better. Do things that make you happy, and spend time with family and friends.|`|ClK9W8THaa	It's ok to think about old boyfriends and old lovers.  It's healthy to have good thoughts flowing through our minds.   Sometimes that's what keeps us feeling good inside and helps us move on to finding that same feeling we left behind or even walked away from us.<br>    Because 10 out of 10, they are thinking of you in the same manner.  You just will never know.    What's not excepting is when you act on those feelings and one party is with someone else , that's not kool.   Finding someone else is probally the last thing you want to do at this very moment.  Taking time out from a relationship and giving yourself all the attention is what you really need to be doing.   Relaxing and doing nothing is always the best method when under these circumstances.  It allows you to re-group and put things back in perspective.   So don't beat yourself up about what you feel inside... Know that it's only a stepping stone to strengthen your heart and  it makes you  wiser and a  stronger person .  That's what makes us who we are .|`|AIftgLEGaa	The only way to stop thinking about him is either to wait (which is a huge pain) or find another guy. I recommend the second choice.

4IHe4rPYaa	not normally. if the guy broke it up they say i still wanna be friends so her feelings arent hurt as bad.|`|dx9AZ16Paa	Depends.<br>  If the guy really loved you or not.<br>  you got to read between the lines.<br>  if he is just being nice and dont want to see you hurt.<br>  or <br>  love's you and dont want to hurt you.|`|eM4sc25Qaa	He would want to know everything about her and would probably get his info any way he can get it|`|xZiK3okSaa	If you had a decent relationship then yes,the guy usually does care about his ex. All of my exs still text or call me occasionally,and they do ask how i am and what ive been up to. However ive also realized that some of them still want to have sex with me without dating again...so just be careful. But yes guys usually do still care.|`|wzcJ9TO7aa	Sometimes guys break up with girls over stupid and foolish things sometimes they let their pride and anger drive away the one they love.<br>  If a girl really meant a lot to a guy and their love wagenuinene if that girl in the future ends up 6ft deep in trouble then you'll always try to save her cause in a little way a little love is left in your heart for her.|`|kMMnfLNqaa	I know a lot of guys who've broken up with their Girlfriends, but still wanted to be friends. They still care about them, but not like that. They'd still probably care if something happened to them. Probably. Everyone is different.|`|3i7GZVwQaa	yea he would definently care about those things because he still wants to be friends instead of just cutting you off completely
zxQT3Uo5aa	play it by ear, the ball is in her court|`|vwoqIUR6aa	thanks for answering my question.<br>  <br>  Stop calling her. You have shown your interest in her. I assume she has your number and can call you back to do something. This way you know for sure if she likes you or not. If you know a friend of hers, ask about her.|`|m3NVpPpiaa	You have reached out more than once and she knows that you have an interest in her. She may be playing games knowing that she has you where she wants you, lets hope I'm wrong. She may be seeing someone else too. I would not be a part of that, I respect myself too much and you should respect yourself and lay low. Don't call her anymore, if she cares she will notice your absence and give you a call, but be careful, your probably not the only man in her life. Good luck!|`|UsJDUm1Haa	yes. it sounds like shes lost interest and is cheating on you. maybe you should stop calling her and after awhile you might be suprised she might call you. but if i were you tell her that your busy and u will catch up with her later. see how it makes her feel. if she likes you then she will get upset and try calling you.....(best answer?)|`|0VLirxVtaa	If she doesn't call, then I think that you should call her and ask her what is going on. You will always be happier if you ask someone straight up rather than taking signs from people. Good Luck!<br>  -Hope it works out!|`|XasLRQnXaa	sounds like she just wanted a one night stand, move on.|`|wdbwl9l6aa	I don't really know what to tell you because that situation is rather weird. Play it out a little more and see what happens. If you don't want to do that then I suggest you walk away.|`|G2J5m25Vaa	If you like this girl go after her, but if you think she won't like it having you around back off and let her have some space. If shes says she gonna call back wait for an hour and if she doesn't call YOU should call her.|`|duQ2cXKCaa	I think she's ready to move on but doesn't really know how to tell you so she's slightly ignoring you-politely. Just be friends with her and find someone else.|`|C30NreILaa	she doesn't like you if she doesn't call for over a week or talk to you in general|`|sSBZJPClaa	wait a while she could be shy or something..and maybe she really was going with a friend. i think this depends if you like her or not: / otherwise yea probably break up:(|`|y4ZB492oaa	yes because she's probably cheating|`|NBnOhmOiaa	yea it is weird but maybe when u slept over tht did somthing|`|Urv6eDB5aa	Yeah you did enough . Don't call again
UxRoUTvCaa	I don't think there's a hard and fast rule, but it does look like he's into you.|`|23kap6Feaa	i think he likes you<br>  <br>  but <br>  <br>  when in doubt whip it out|`|yohIvQkgaa	ur 23 y would u want to mess round wit 18 year old?? bt yea he is intrested..|`|XI3blPQtaa	just invite him over to 'hang out' and see what happens!
NSi0xTQ0aa	okay first of all thanks for answering my question. i've been in your situation and what u need to do is act like nothing happened. its only awkward if u make it awkward. and trust me, if u make it seem like u dont care and dont mention it or anything, he'll like u bc he'll like the fact tht u dont worry about little things like tht. good luck :)|`|tWvM6M0raa	if you talk to him loads then act as though nothing has happened and just pretend you didn't no what your guy friend said<br>  if Spencer asks you about it, just admit you like him but say you don't want it to ruin your friendship<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|490afd31237596b1c1ff4eb283c2c549aa	Thanks for answering mine :) Well I would kinda act like nothing happened, but maybe flirt with him a little more, if he is acting normal. Hope everything works out!|`|nXVmjArBaa	I'm not very good with this kinda stuff, i know it's going to be tough but I think you should just be the same as you have been, who knows, he could like you|`|GnkoLPImaa	just tell spencer that your guy friend was fooling around & its nothin of that sort.|`|D8bTsWr8aa	Just be yourself!
5SyjY5RNaa	He sounds like a real jerk (sorry! i just think you could do better and someone a bit more considerate :D), however, i'll refrain from the "move on" comments..<br>  <br>  Try talking dirty with him, and try more foreplay? I never had sex before so can't really help you with the later part.<br>  <br>  Help with on of mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlhSwn5rS50_bfWOx872_ULsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222141343AAYF87n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	He's insensitive towards your needs and places too much emphasis on the sex. If you want to keep him, then fine. But the sexual chemistry is off and he's so into the sex that he'll probably dump you.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing your not the type to get real kinky and do things like role play. My best advice is go to an "adult store" and try to find some toys that you feel comfortable experimenting with.<br>  <br>  And if you're like 16, then that's really sad b/c guys under 20 usually have no problem staying up no matter what. It's sad for him, not really b/c of you.<br>  <br>  Just b/c you don't turn HIM on doesn't mean you are not sexy. There are very few people so attractive that they are guaranteed to turn on just about every straight member of the opposite sex.|`|TsoXZKSyaa	that's terrible! That's f***ing terrible!!! <br>  Honey I'm so sorry that this jerk happened to you, he is bloody disgraceful :@<br>  there is absolutely no way he should have EVER said those things to you! ESPECIALLY right after that situation!!<br>  <br>  I want to say dump him. Dump him to keep  your dignity, if you stay with him things are going to get worse and worse until he dumps you, and then you will be even more crushed.  Show him you don't deserve to be treated like this and dump him!!! <br>  <br>  I'm so sorry sweatie :(|`|crbzVL0Haa	Darling. . .<br>  <br>  Dump him. <br>  <br>  That's all you're going to get here. <br>  <br>  He was rude, inconsiderate, and the only thing he's interested in is obviously sex. You're young, you're not going to marry him. I PROMISE. <br>  <br>  So get over it and find someone else. <br>  <br>  Ok?<br>  <br>  Ok. Thank you.
wlVqU2EBaa	Wow. Jerk... dump him, then you won't have to worry about it.|`|klcqgST9aa	He's not a good man. You should dump him. If he doesn't respect you, you deserve better.|`|m6mjcGdKaa	hes a total jerk.<br>  seriously, what an ***.<br>  <br>  you were a freaking virgin, how could you possibly know what to do?!<br>  HE should apologize, not you<br>  HE should talk to you nicely, help you<br>  HE shouldnt complain, your doing him, arent you? and hes a total ***<br>  <br>  what a loser.|`|crbzVL0Haa	Darling, you shouldn't be asking guys.<br>  <br>  You should dump him. <br>  <br>  Virginity is important to us women. <br>  <br>  He's an asshole. Get rid of him. Most men are so freakishly selfish in bed with there method of mindless thrusting that it doesn't even matter if you're good or not, they'll enjoy themselves and YOU WON'T.<br>  <br>  Find a better man, darling. Please.|`|UE9e10Avaa	sounds like a loser to me...sorry, but he does.|`|Z2JMFDZ6aa	You don't deserve that.<br>  You go right up to him and dump him.<br>  He doesnt deserve YOU.<br>  Hes putting you down. making you feel worse about yourself.<br>  <br>  He should be ashamed of himself for saying that.<br>  <br>  Saying that his ex's are beter than you.<br>  what a low life slimeball.<br>  <br>  find someone that cares for you. <br>  Dont stay with this *** wipe.<br>  pardon the expression.|`|cFd00priaa	If he can't keep it up and he's not stressed etc, then the only reason he's having sex with you is because he can't keep it in his pants. He doesn't care about you, and doesn't value you or what you gave him.<br>  <br>  This guy is not worth the time you spent writing this question. Get rid of him and find a man who will appreciate you for who you are.
cFd00priaa	Hair and shoulders.|`|fex9lpeaaa	sometimes its a girls eyes. other times it a girls radiant hair. (honestly i am a guy sometimes its there butt or breasts)|`|UxRoUTvCaa	Face.|`|0FrJy2NEaa	lips
wggQRDb2aa	just because somebody didn't get to go to college doesn't make them dumb. <br>  who cares about material things and what people think if he makes you happy.<br>  Talk to him about it. see how he feels about your "circle of friends"|`|8edde553fb96c6c0e8189b3c7844fc69aa	It certainly can work.  Statistically there are some factors that contribute to the likelihood of a marriage succeeding or failing.  For example, the more education the two people have, the better chances they will have.  However, the greater the age spread is, which means the greater the probability for a difference in emotional maturity is, the less chance two people will have.  BUT those are statistics, and nothing is 100% in most cases.<br>  <br>  Even in cases where two people are the same age, same cultural background, same education, etc., there is still no sure way to know whether or not they will succeed without trying it.  Therefore, it is up to you to do your own work, identify your own values and compare them with his, and make a determination on how well (or not well) you and him can support each other's personalities.|`|VPMUuIxUaa	why are you asking about 6 years, it's not like he is 20 and you are 14, as long as you love each other and you have things in common, it whouldn't matter|`|X9Xt16dbaa	My aunt and uncle are 14 years apart! They're happily married with two children.  It will work out fine if your question is about the age difference.|`|AA10510158	I am 32 and my guy is 28 and he and I are great!  One misconception that our society has is that our job defines us as people.  If he is a great guy, don't let him get away.  There are not that many great guys out there.  Hold on to him with both hands.  As for inviting him into your circle of friends, be proud to be with him.  There are things to talk about other than work.  Are you embarrassed because he doesn't have a prestigious job?  That would be awful immature and close-minded.  Open your heart and your mind.|`|VQu0SIO6aa	Well my b/f is 34 and I am 23, but I met him in my circle of friends. Love the older men! I wouldn't ever date anyone under 32 ever again....I probably wouldn't go over 38. <br>  I would say that if he is cool enough, and you have 'good' friends, they will except him....but only base you friends judgement if it has to do with his personality, not age. <br>  If he is able to support hiself and occasionally take you out then thats fine. Besides your not marrying the guy, your just trying him out!
oGGYnu9Vaa	First of all let me tell you i give you props:)<br>  this is really sweet!<br>  <br>  well, of course you don't walk away. You tell her how you feel about<br>  her and you wait for her response.<br>  If she doesn't respond then you simply be the bigger person<br>  and say i respect your decision, i understand you obviously <br>  don't have the same feeling but i had to get this off my chest<br>  before i dig myself any deeper.<br>  ( but if she does do that all you need to know is you need someone way better then that! :] )<br>  <br>  But if she responds to you and she feels the same way then you<br>  go on from what she said to you. "]<br>  <br>  Good luck i wish the best for you!<br>  & i hope i have helped you.|`|R8meMz8gaa	Well once you have told her then she will know that you really want to be in this relationship with her, so she'll probably have something to say back. Don't be nervous. This happens in every relationship. I know that you are nervous but don't be. She will be so happy!!! hope it goes make sure you tell me what happens when you tell her!!! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|ORB3owf7aa	lol ok you deff dont walk away<br>  tht would piss her off<br>  ok look ddeep in her eyes<br>  say i love u<br>  then keep looking(she prob will say it back)<br>  either way grab her face and give her the most amazing kiss <br>  no tongue thts not romantic thts just horny lol<br>  good luck

You can make him/her jealous, be the way you were when you two first met, or even be a completely new person that you know he/she would fall for, but it's better not to. Old love can never be new love. Think about the times he/she hurt you and remember that you don't want that again. Move on. Find someone better.|`|ffpdB1tzaa	Hi there!

hz6Lo0wraa	Well from dealing with shy guys before, he either likes you or really dislikes you. Chances are he likes you. If you happen to have a myspace, facebook anything like that, look him up and see if he will add you. If he rejects you that would be an answer. If you can't "find" him on any of those sites, then just slip him a paper in gym that asks for his aim, yahoo instant messenger, or something like that. Talk for a little bit and then send on of those messages that says "Do you like me?" A follow up question may be needed of "Do you like like me?" <br>  <br>  I hope this does not come across sarcastically, it is what I used to do in HS.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Oh for heaven's sake!

Try a small wave. To really find out is to have some kind of communication. People who get what they want go after it. Don't be afraid of rejection. If you get knocked down you'll get up. You find that the pain isn't as bad as you made it. Don't be afraid to sound or look stupid. That goes away. I was shy and I got tired of all the other people taking the people I wanted. You'll find out how easy it gets to say what you want when you just say what you want. At first you might not get the affect you wanted, but just keep in mind- So What!  just go for it over and over till you meet your happiness. good luck|`|rKbJ51XIaa	I`m in the same position!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

1M90Aoytaa	dont rush the wedding just for the baby,you can either have it right away and celebrate after the birth or jsut wait until its born then get married, Announce your engagement now, then at least you will be engaged before the baby - be prepared that people will think you are only donig it for the baby (people will work out you were pregnant before you announced the engagenment!) <br>  personally id have the wedding soon after the baby (but not too soon) maybe whenits 6mnths-1yr? <br>  it seems a shame to get a smaller engagemnet ring, the baby is still 9mnths away!|`|AA10928125	I would get married in a private ceremony or the court house,and invite family and friends to a reception,hopefully given by both of your families."We'd like to invite you to a celebration reception in honor of our marriage",that took place Feb 28th.<br>  place:<br>  time:<br>  You can run these off on the computer on some really pretty copy paper.

You are just worried about church, aren't you? Looks like you took church's advice about no contraception once, are you going to be so silly as to do that again? I hope not. Time to forget church now and create your own family. Got it? Give church the flip. <br>  <br>  There is no god, anyway, something you will realise as you mature.<br>  <br>  There is nothing special about your case. Millions are similarly involved. But marriage is for your security and that of your child. But if you take it on, accept the resonsibilities. There are more than either of you could ever imagine. It is much harder being married than to bring a child into the world.<br>  <br>  If your folks do not stand by you, don't get anoyed at them. Just tell them to shove their church up their sanctmonious a**s.|`|cCJvsEPsaa	No it will not. Having the love is all that matters in the end.

130e0733e4248f7f06961dce1ec109c2aa	If he said he just wanted to be friends, that should be enough for you. At least he was decent enough to be honest instead of lying to you and using you.
TthDWtPTaa	forget him|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.I'm afraid this guy wants time to stand still.No tomorrows or bad memories.Only now, fun and laughter.He's a dreamer and will wake up tomorrow.Don't think I'd hang around though.His next dream might be a nightmare
wh3BAc4taa	Your son is 17 years old..you shouldn't do anything. He's almost 18 years old. He has a conscience and he knows what's right and what's wrong. He's not stupid. Maybe he doesn't feel like going to church...? And why are you snooping through his room? Let him have his privacy. The magazine is none of your business and you shouldn't try to interfere with his life.|`|uZ8bOXTqaa	have you considered that he might be gay?|`|TDUcM2Bvaa	umm. i think you should be more worried that your son is gay if he has a magazine with naked men it! if he had a girlfriend over in his room she wouldn't need a magazine. I can't believe you found gay porn in your sons room and thought that meant he has a girlfriend! try to talk to him about it, hes probably gay.|`|ilrtnZPyaa	I say that you should talk to him about sex and all the responsability/risks that come with it.|`|Re8MqVNkaa	LOL this was on fail blog, denial fail, sorry but he's gay whether u accept it into "gods plan" or not|`|W6o3UQLkaa	Talk to him about safe sex. Other than that, just chill|`|MFPBz9dHaa	okay coming from a teens point of view. i would say stop snooping in his room first off all give your son some privacy. an also if your son has got a girlfriend an he hasn't introduced you then obviously hes embarrassed to introduce you because maybe hes scared that you might not get along or you might not approve. so instead of making assumptions why not wait until your son actually tells you wats going n. an surely your son had health class in school hes 17 not 12 im sure he would know that he needs to stay safe and doesn't really want children this early in his life :) <br>  <br>  so stop snooping and if things get even more odd try confronting him about it but don't be al on lock down just remember to respect his privacy.<br>  <br>  good luck <br>  <br>  :)
eGpOIV12aa	sounds like he is painfully shy.<br>  <br>  he couldnt bring himself to say what he wanted to say.<br>  <br>  if and when you might see him again, make the first move and take him by the hand. be patient. who knows. it could lead somewhere
7z4ff2Whaa	u sound hot i wud ask u out...maybe u have a shitty personality lol oj<br>  <br>  hey calm down i was only joking im sure u have a gr8 personality ;-)|`|tnJcYdzQaa	First off dont be so envious of other girls. and second maybe you should try asking more people out if they wont you should just try it..|`|syKIxX45aa	Your description is, not going to help, 7 stone , but you don't say what your height is.   Anyway you sound as if you lack self confidence which is something guys like, so maybe this is why they don't ask you out.|`|YANN4mXNaa	You lack confidence that's all.<br>  Eye contact is critical and don't necessarily shy away when a guy looks you in the eye either. Smile when they do if you think you might be interested.<br>  Keep that head up, look people in the eye, listen to what people say and show interest in conversations.<br>  If you act like a lost puppy in a corner people will see you as such.<br>  <br>  Once you have confidence just watch them fly to the light.|`|AA12087415	I think you just need to start to go to places where there are guys who're interested in the same things as you.<br>  <br>  And then you will be a few small days away from meeting them when you do this.<br>  <br>  <br>  also why should they "ask you out" you can always ask them too you know.|`|YUjSRiv5aa	Talk more and be outgoing. <br>  I'm sure guys will come your way then.|`|h0u4VVUDaa	its obvious! you lack confidence! you can say all this on the computer because no one can see you on here, but i bet youd die if you had to take time to explain this to other people face to face.<br>  you sound quite shy...nothng wrong with this a lot of boys find this "cute" but you do at least need to be able to keep a conversation going! try going to somewhere that interests you,the people who go there will then have the same interest which will give you something in common to talk about.<br>  or if theres a boy you likefind out what hes interested in and ask him about it.youre young yet...dont try too hard.it will happen in time.just believe in yourself and smile!!!|`|PUyNqPlJaa	Well, sometimes guys can be just as nervous and insecure about asking girls out so I would say its understandable they won't get too close if they think they will get turned down.<br>  <br>  I would say make an effort to participate as much as possible, so you can show how friendly and nice you are. Maybe you could join a club or society that interests you - I know others have met boys that way.<br>  <br>  In the end, don't let it get to you too much, just try to relax and enjoy yourself and let the guys see that too!|`|5rRgcedhaa	its about personality to which im sure you hav so go out ther and get talkin|`|F0MWIYk5aa	do you want to go with me|`|pT7mHBEVaa	send a pic to conchillin123@yahoo.co.uk and i will tell u

Don't actually say that, just use a winky face a lot in your texts.  Like this: <br>   <br>  ;)<br>  <br>  Or say stuff like<br>  "Sup, hottie?"<br>  "So how come you don't have a girlfriend? Looks to me like the girls'd be all over you..."<br>  "How often do you go to the gym, like 5 hours a day?"|`|6PNuFgTJaa	Apply something sexy to a conversation!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Texting is a crude method of communicating.  It has no rules.  It is so informal it lacks accountability.  Verify the messages you are getting in some other format including asking a person with your actual voice.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|m3NVpPpiaa	Muuuuuuuaahhh!!|`|eMXIQaQlaa	I miss you, nicknames, xoxo|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	idk im bad at that too

But yes, i think short guy are attractive, im attracted to everyone..everywhere i look.. "damnnn"|`|PK5Elowdaa	Just let it go. Girls way of thinking about men and height is sorta like the whole, "I wanna feel protected " mentality. Just because a guy is taller doesn't mean hes not a pu ssy. I mean, MMA fights on  is a good example that size doesn't matter. When females talk about height, its more so like they're talking about a hand bag. It makes them look better. The solution is to find a girl who is your height or shorter. There's plenty.|`|ucbrBXK2aa	well imshort so yes, but if i was very tall and he was short <br>  hmm, not so much|`|c4qZRoQgaa	depends-<br>  the guy i like is much shorter then i am. <br>  but i still like him|`|n9IZtcD0aa	i'm 5'7" and i stand up straight, stick my hand over my head, wrist bent and say: You must be this tall to ride this ride.  Now, that being said, I have never actually dated or slept with a man that tall.  The last three guys I was with were 5'10", my height, and about 5'5".  If you are attractive then it doesn't matter how tall you are.  yes, for some women it will turn them away from you, but many just don't care and many shorter women don't want to feel dwarfed by their men so shorter is nice.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I learned in my life not to judge a book by its cover. I like any man that has a good personality it seems to go farther then. Yes I do find short men to be very attractive. Hope I helped.|`|Nb78LtG9aa	Well I'm short. (5' 1")<br>  As long as they are like.. 4 inches taller than me and have a good personality..<br>  then yes.|`|CCWYBm1gaa	well if they are hot than it would be ok for me if i was a girl.|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	Honestly, no.

DFZ3eZM1aa	Look, I am sorry. I dont think that you are going to find your dad on yahoo answers. I know this is probably not what you want to hear, and I am sure that you are very curious as to what your dad is like, and about how your sisters are. If you found out all this, then who did you find this from?<br>  If it was your mom, then she probably has contact with him as to get all this information. You could go into her email without her knowing and see if there are any emails from him. <br>  Also, cam google him, and he will probably show up under his business, and it will say where he lives, and it might say his email address. Then just go from there.<br>  It seems like he should be paying child support, and if he is not, then your mom should put out a warrent for him, and he will get arrested, because it is illegal not to. <br>  Other than that, all I have to say is good luck, and I hope you find your dad.

Wv592rOqaa	Group dating around 13-15 - gives you time to become friends and learn about each other without the pressure of saying this is my boyfriend of girlfriend.  Also, it allows your parents to monitor the type of people you are hanging out with and gives you the chance to eliminate gracefully the ones that are jerks.  <br>  <br>  There is no manual that says you have to date 1 person at a time since dating should not include any sexual encounters - dating gives you the freedom to go out with different people until you pick someone you think is compatible -and you would turn 16-18 by the end of this getting to know the person phase.  Always keep your dating public so that there is no room for lies or rumours - and there always will be at least one untrue story in the 11-16 age groups.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	If you can't actually go anywhere to have an actual date without your mommy and daddy having to cart you around, then you're too young.|`|fTpk7ospaa	i think dating should be the persons choice for example when you feel ready/comfortable|`|WoAAdxHEaa	12 or 13 if its with a person of your same age. don't date anyone older till 15 or 16|`|kDyj5d7laa	I think that it depends on you and how comfortable about the whole dating situation, but i think 15 is a good age. I mean when you see like 10 year olds and they have boyfriends, that is a little creepy. i mean there is no point in it. You change so much over the time between when you are 10 and when you are 15.|`|18tN4SlXaa	I'm almost 14 and I have been dating a guy for a year and a half.

AW1dCzH0aa	If she's not registered, here are some ideas that I suggest people register for.  Just because he already has a home full of things, doesn't mean he has items that she'll need to host dinners and such.  Perhaps some pieces of serverware?  <br>  <br>  Nice steak knives<br>  Kitchen towels and oven mits<br>  Couch pillow covers<br>  Throw blankets<br>  Table cloths<br>  Table runners<br>  Place mats<br>  Linen napkins<br>  Napkin rings<br>  Flatware set and tray<br>  Cake server and cake knife<br>  Serving spoons and forks<br>  Serving trays/platters<br>  Cake/pie stand<br>  Cheese tray<br>  Nice salt/pepper shakers<br>  Electric knife (for turkey and ham!)<br>  Nice towels and bath mats<br>  PICTURE FRAMES (b/c she'll have tons of wedding pics!)<br>  Framed mirrors for walls<br>  Nice vases<br>  Wine glasses or nice water glasses<br>  Table lamps (or floor lamps)<br>  Wall prints<br>  Decorative bowls<br>  Nice candlesticks<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Ask the hostess(es) of the shower if she's registered anywhere. <br>  <br>  Is she is registered, go  to the store and see what sort of gifts she has registered for.  You can either choose one of those items or something similar.<br>  <br>  If she's not registered, ask for suggestions on what would be a good gift to get her for her shower.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	If little old church ladies are there I'd avoid lingerie.  It may embarrass a lot of people.  If the congregation is younger I'd still get it.  Everyone knows they'll have sex at some point and it'd be a fun gift.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, check if they are registered anywhere.  A registry will tell you exactly what they want.  Gift Cards are good too, but stick with somewhere that has variety (sears, macy's target, walmart etc).|`|28aa15ff815174fd0da9e6d6dd19aeedaa	Make her a basket filled with 12 mini-bottles of champagne.  Tape the date for each month after her wedding day.  Then explain to her...that for one full year, they can celebrate their monthly anniversary with a toast to each other.  I always get rave reviews when I give this gift.  Very cute!<br>  <br>  And if they don't drink...make a basket of Sparkling apple cider.  It gives them a fun tradition to do each month.|`|c40GaZOQaa	A gift certificate to a local spa for a massage or manicure or something would be lovely!|`|1M90Aoytaa	maybe something they can do together like a hot air ballon or a weekend away - depends what you want to spend - if its a small token gift maybe an orniment that symbolises love and marriage|`|CBlHCv79aa	She should be registered somewhere.. and if not, gift certificates are always wonderful.<br>  <br>  Or if you want to get her like a gift gift.. then get her a spa day or something. Planning a wedding is very stressful she could probably use a day to relax.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	Keep praying sista!|`|KGOxYkh7aa	um sorry but being in love with a celeb is hopeless.<br>  been there.|`|L69jZMXQaa	uhhh well i dont think you're actually in love with him. and theres zero chance of you ever even meeting him|`|hGWhzfFqaa	You're not in love with someone if you never met him. You're probably in love with the character he plays, but that's not how he really is. You know nothing about him. You're not in love with him sweetie.|`|AA10710749	if hes a celeb and u cant see him there is no probleme with that a lot fall in love wit celebs even if they r younger or older then them|`|7SvSazrfaa	Not if you look like leather face.<br>  Go get a facelift, and stop tanning.,<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|8OvTtGiZaa	Well, if the guy is 33 and the girl is 18.  I think that he could love her for a little while anyway.|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	That's just infatuation with a celeb. Nothing to worry (or pray) about. It'll go away by itself. Just try to focus on things that are real, like school, sports, friends and stuff like that. Don't dwell in the fantasy world that you have up there in your head. Don't spend too much time by yourself or alone in your room. That's not healthy. Get out of the house and enjoy your life.|`|MNDvP3rxaa	do you even know the guy? if hes a celeb i assume not. heres the thing, if you havent met him, you pretty much have 1 in a million chances of meeting him, let alone him falling in love with you. move on and find somebody your own age.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Keep prayimg or talk to him. I am a christian too and I found out that God does indeed work in mysterious ways. If it is meant to be it will happen.|`|8bb7564e6b51f403a948dbb1465c7692aa	yes pray about it, best thing to do|`|UTGDIOsOaa	dude ur gay thats the problem its ok to be gay if u like a guy but who cares if u like guys go sleep wit 1 lol|`|go3ajgwOaa	just keep praying and if its faith it can happen|`|rlCgZXQ4aa	that would be sooo wrong

RRhukDeDaa	Your eyes and your hair and really pretty! You could probably get brownish highlights to make your hair stand out =]]|`|Fixpqebsaa	See it depends on the guy. I for one happen to think you look nice in this picture, but I don't judge girls pretty-ness based off of a picture. It is whether or not the girl looks good in the morning, in the night, with or without makeup and she's nice.|`|yglAvhE1aa	You have beatiful eyes,<br>  I think you'd look even prettier if you got bangs, or maybe got some streeks in your hair?|`|WBtifYxDaa	try parting your hair off to one side.. your eyes are really pretty!|`|TCexuCbpaa	your not that great|`|9Be0FySnaa	i can tell u this, everybody is Beautiful. and attractive to somebody people tend to forget that the world is a big place and when stuck into every day life school or work that the people you see are usually then people that you are around with for a massive percentage of your time.<br>  but my honest opinion is you are a very attractive young lady. yet don't judge yourself on what other people think,|`|rp6yAfw3aa	your so conceited its making me sick....

Screw him.|`|AA10934463	nope no good reason thats gross and if you guys were to go out ..hes not going to  chnage so forget about him .|`|xHqqZEXNaa	F*CK HIM, you dont need that sh*t|`|TthDWtPTaa	yes|`|yWUIMiyyaa	just look past him, damn that is a hard thing to do.  it took me the longest time to get over my gf for cheating with my friend and then she slapt me in the face for being mad. it's  probably just a natural reaction to get away or to hurt someone more after they are already down. <br>  <br>  sorry girl that sucks, but it will all fade in time.<br>  <br>  "Love Hurts" incubus|`|AIv0Fu8Xaa	Well first off i hope this is a female.<br>  ummm well i dont know why he would even do that cause thats like low-down.<br>  and he's just a jack ***, i would embarass him infront of everybody. Get back at him,REVENGE!!!<br>  oh yeah and thanks 4 your answer!!!!=]|`|P31J6x2oaa	Dont waste your time thinking about him hun, he hurt you and if you think about him and what he did then he is hurting you over and over again. Try to think about good things that dont involve him and try and move forward... good luck xxx|`|jZb5zMCvaa	i think he's feeling stupid that you ignored him but who cares. he slept with someone in your family, he should think about that one. hello? just leave him alone, you can do better.|`|O8BoOvuwaa	Guys are just retarded like that . It's probably just his stupid way of trying to get your attention again, he probably misses you . But f*ck him .

The reason he would have to hurt you is because he can't put himself above everyone in his own eyes any other way. he is a coward and not even worthy to be called a human.|`|oOglMujdaa	No he is not trying to kick you while you are down... he is testing the water to see if you respond to him. Watch for his "out door phone conversations" to get more frequent, or closer...or something similar. You will have to tell him to go away sometime soon...its coming. So make sure thats what you want.|`|mdzmiL8daa	Yes he is. It's obvious.|`|oC8eOFH8aa	It sounds to me like he's scum. You're too good for him, and make sure he knows it.|`|vfcD8Ic1aa	ooo thats awful!!!|`|NgawN7Pcaa	he's an *** .<br>  ignore him .<br>  CHEATERS WILL NEVER CHANGE !|`|QPTlQCiSaa	He knows it hurts you and wants you to keep thinking of him...my ex hubby slept with my mother,,,about 4 years ago, I still can't look at my mother and I haven't spoken to her since, Isn't family great?!?!?!

ldQFvpHxaa	Well, if you are really having these feelings with your friend then maybe you should just take some time to think it over really carefully, while your boyfriend is away, and when he comes back, make your decision. Hope this helps!|`|KJxwNfsaaa	follow your heart.<br>  you might be in love with 2 guys,<br>  but your always gonna love 1 more than the other.<br>  so figure out who that 1 is and make a move.<br>  long distance relationships are hard for some people to commit,<br>  and is the reason they break up<br>  so if thats the case dont feel bad.<br>  what i would do is break up with the guy in the military BUT not be with the other guy.<br>  just have both of them as friends for now,<br>  and when the military guy gets done and you know what his plans are for the other part of his life is when you make your decision on who you want to be with.
TthDWtPTaa	sounds like you do
e2023980e76f8f01d5ba81251c994b7caa	It all depends on where you are.  You're area may not have enough of either race there to mingle if you're in bfe Idaho.  I live in LA and I'm only the 2nd or 3rd AM/BF couple I've seen.  My boyfriend is Asian - we met through friends.  <br>  The more racially diverse an area is the more likely you'll find mixed race couples.  The AM/BF combination is a rare one to come across but they are there :)|`|c4FP3bGvaa	coming from an asian man, asians sense of beauty tend to be tall lean big eyed b-c cup girls and more importantly pale skin color as in almost white.<br>  and i go for those chicks. black chicks tend to be more curvy and not pale skin color. so yea.... if thats not the reason for most asians its my reason.<br>  were talking only physical traits.
YR9WIklJaa	first, i belive he is defently into you girl! but to make sure, test him a little. i mean flirt with him! if he flirts back its a total yes! does he get jelous when you are around other guys? becasue thats a good way to tell. and if you are still not sure, just go for it. whats the worst that can happen? if he says no, just stop trying to flirt with him and just concentrate on being friends. but with my personal experiances, HE'S SO INTO YOU!!!|`|cukUy7D6aa	You never know until you ask....and does he take the time to call you without you calling him first? Cu trust me if he likes you he will make time for you and and let you know he likes you.|`|AA10534526	No, not all boys flirt. Just wanted to get that straightened out. How long have you known him? Because maybe you should just ask him, none of us are going to know.|`|pv00LC3naa	let him tell u. or u might ruin it if ur wrong|`|ncGn32CSaa	as a guy If I did that i clearly like the girl more then a friend|`|YY3ZLpiWaa	if he's really nice to you|`|ZldKA17Iaa	he likessssssssss youuuuuu !|`|L69jZMXQaa	he def likes u as more than a friend|`|dVzPKGGiaa	He feels the same way with you.

AA10500537	if you;re a teen ager they have the right if you;re of age no you have the right to do as you please just move out if you have a job and can afford it.<br>  too many  kids  are staying home and just living off their parenys today . <br>  but please dont hate your parents  .|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Hate them? Why don't you hate them enough to move out and take care of yourself? They are being your parents, you don't like that,  to bad, just move out and maybe you'll grow up and realize that parents have rules and if you move out you don't have to worry about  their rules.|`|cZISRMylaa	What kids likes rules and boundaries? Some parents are too strict some parents are too lienient. Who's to say what is too strict or not. If they aren't abusive and you can talk to them try and reason with them I don't let my kids date umtil they are 16 and wont let them wear makeup until they are 13 1/2 they can't have boys in their bedrooms and I have to meet the friends and parents before they go to someones house, they call that strict I call it playing it safe. I always say you love your kids unconditionally but it doesn't mean you have to like them all the time, by that I mean the choices they make and the moods they are in. If strict parents are all you have love them and enjoy your freedom when you are out on your own.|`|QBIsLeO0aa	Well strict can be good to help you grow up right. But saying that I hate my father but that could be because he used to stand there and watch as I got beaten for speaking my mind as I grew up in a cult|`|Lj3LyPUUaa	They are strict because they love you, and you don't truly hate them. You only hate the situation. You still love them, but you hate how they are acting.|`|JNY4BEASaa	yes|`|91cf384812c70e7be98127cfb613c955aa	Your post doesn't really tell how they were so strict or controlling.  What did they do that was so horrible that you should hate them?  I grew up with strict parents.  I thought at times that I hated them too, but I didn't really.  Looking back on how they raised me, I don't really regret how they treated me.  It made me hold higher expectations for myself.  I think a lot of parents these days spend a lot of time trying to be a friend, rather than an authority figure or guide.  Forgive them.  You'll thank them later.|`|8KtOLa0aaa	Yes, We all have the side effects of parents.<br>  But they love us and they DO care. <br>  Strict is just a way of showing you that they care. <br>  You could try to have a conversation at the right time, see if you could get more free time out or on your computer. It is Okay you hate your parents from time to time. Everyone has these thoughts.<br>  You could try showing them that you can handle yourself or do chores. <br>  I hoped I helped, even if was a little. <br>  Claudia <3|`|dElKBtnJaa	Sometimes we don't like what parents do and say but when there strict<br>  is usually because they want whats best for us.Now and days parents tend to me even more strict do to how the world has change don't hate them. Now if they are abusing you then you need to run and get help.

KPXwwwMMaa	Well you could start out by asking other people lots of questions to get THEM talking. This usually opens people up and makes them interested in you, too. People in college usually talk about the same things as in high school: movies, cars, relationships. So, i think you're safe. <br>  <br>  Usually when people are in college, however they feel like they are smart and want people to understand them and their point of view. Listen a lot. Ask lots of questions. Be agreeable, and don't try to argue with people, no matter how silly they sound. <br>  <br>  Just stay grounded, and keep your eyes out. You'll soon find people who you relate with very well.
DwgmPUHMaa	Because your a Silly Boy and i just like to match (:|`|zKc66WSXaa	because im in your moms vagina|`|qpm8FqiWaa	lol cuz its fun

Its ppl like them that make this world a bad place!<br>  peace!|`|7minC5Evaa	Ask Him.<br>  easy as that.<br>  And i think you're question is reallly happening.<br>  And the title should be: My friend came out of the closet.|`|92fNY4Fvaa	if he is your friend, you need to be there for him.  coming out as a homosexual is very hard, and its even harder when people especially his own friends reject him for being honest with them.<br>  be a friend to him, talk to him, just let him know that even though he told you this secret of his, you are still his friend, and that nothing has changed between you two.<br>  because, really, the only difference in your relationship now, is that he likes boys sexually and you don't, that doesn't mean you need to not be his friend anymore.
qXjw8acUaa	that's exactly it man, if you threw money at her that wouldn't be love that'd be an attempt at buying her affection...so good idea not to throw money...the best route to take here is to get the power back...her denying your attempt at a relationship has given her all the power by doing what's known in sales as a take away, so the only way for you to be in control now is to take it away from her, because we all want what we can't have...so initially agree to her proposal of friends with benefits and not only agree but let that be the ideal situation for you due to the fact that you're actually not wanting to be tied down to her because there are a couple other girls you're interested in and want to see where it's going with them as well...then the next part is the hardest part....you're going to need to actually NOT hang out with her the next time she wants to...you need to be 'busy' and already have plans with another lady friend of yours...EVEN IF YOU DON'T...then my friend...SHE'S ALL YOURS!!!! if you do it right of course...but i promise that is a full proof plan|`|AA11878029	You cant find love with out the money...impossible !!!<br>  <br>  Just kidding---eye contact, smiles and flirting are all loving signs.  also compliment her looks !!!|`|noGTQvFYaa	dont do i t she is not worth it.. i mean is firends with benefits mening she could be making out with 49 other guys as well.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Throwing money at anyone is not showing love just how much money you have to waste and any girls who thinks this is showing love is not worth a boys/mans time..you sow you care for someone in everyday ways..by the way you speak to her, listen to her..be there for her when she is upset..and needs your support in her life..when she is feeling down and stressed..  and your loyalty and honesty...and putting up with her less great points that we all as ppl have..girls/women want to feel they are loved as well a stold as just the words without any real meaning actively.. mean absolutely nothing..|`|351c290819306de7d8413b70e24f10ebaa	If she does not feel anything for you but friendly than you need to be her friend and in the end if something more than friendship is in your future, you both will know it.  Listen to her.....Please.|`|8929fa2803b58abe640d9bd8cb8c209eaa	Just be affectionate, tell her you love her, and be sweet.

Depending on your girl, throwing money at her might be the only way to show her that you love her. If not it wouldn't be a bad idea to take her on a date to maybe the movies, a fancy restaurant, or get some Chinese, women love Chinese. Talk to her and listen to what she has to say before you start talking about yourself, ask her question and get to know each other. So, try that!|`|goIO1hJnaa	well why does she think you should only be friends with benefits? If she's not ready for a relationship, or even if she just wants you as a booty call, I think it might be best to wait in the wings for a little while and show her what a great friend you are and the boyfriend potential. You dont need to throw money to show your love, just the little things like remembering birthdays, and her little quirks will get appreciated!|`|c1yt66wNaa	If she says she only wants to be friends, she is probably just not comfortable with being a couple. She might have just had a breakup or somewhat like that and is just not ready to handle a relationship.

2YmzqL1baa	You need to talk to your best friend about it.<br>  I suggest no though. I did the same thing and me and my boy do not talk anymore. Its hard, but you need to stop talking to her before its too late. I mean your best friend will always be there, she may not. Plus if you and her break up, you might have lost both of them.|`|zhsTxqGxaa	I'm sort of in the same boat as you are.  Just spend some time with her and ask to hang out with you.  But yes, that was good that you told her how you feel about her.  Girls love honesty.|`|D3bLcWNsaa	your gonna mess up your friendship. but if you think this girl is worth it and she doesn't still have feelings for him, and she's not just useing you to get closer to him, then i guess go for it. but i think you should just stick with flirting and see what happens
IgEYfBPJaa	talk to her about how you feel, but if you love her dont finish her, but then if you dont trust her then finish her. :/<br>  just talk and sort things out, then decide. :)|`|AA12133859	yes break up with her and get in to counseling and work on your self esteem.  You have the tendencies of an abuser.|`|Gza8jaboaa	i think you should finish with her...cause she might do sumthing stupid and then u might get hurt..and then u would hurt cause u would ahve feel in for love with her..|`|9ua9hwImaa	She cant help boys hitting on her...it's how she reacts that you should look at!<br>  <br>  If she flirts with them, dump her.

I would ask her if she needs to talk or get anything out, because she is acting differently lately.|`|UlvWbJL1aa	I'm guessing someone has hurt her presently or in the past. She may not want to get hurt again by untrue friends. She is just putting her self out there and telling everyone how real she it. Sounds like she has been burned.|`|GJb2OSrnaa	denial about drama, is just saying she likes to be in it...<br>  <br>  i just know that from experience<br>  <br>  <br>  i dunno why ur chick is being that way....it probably has more to do with whats going on tween u to that it does with myspace|`|lyDzjMfcaa	Ohhhh Noooooo!!!<br>  <br>  Myspace drama!!!!!!<br>  <br>  She sounds like a bit of a 2faced b8tch though.|`|CCyB12Tbaa	Sounds like she can be a little nasty?

It also seems like she's a bit conceited, which is never good. And it kind of seems like you'd be walking on egg shells being with her, because in her info she's saying if you push her buttons then there will be hell to pay.|`|z0torDIWaa	I don't really think it pertains to you. I mean it depends on what she has done to be a *****. Ya know us girls, we can be pretty moody. Don't take it personally(;<br>  <br>  The drama is normal, the "true friends" may be just because she had a fight with a friend and didn't tell you.  I'd say don't worry about it.(:<br>  Good luck|`|BbaR8Hhqaa	I would talk to her about her mood with you lately.<br>  Maybe she is trying to test your personality and if you really like her and will stay with her over things like little fights.<br>  <br>  You got to keep in mind, girls DO get moody and attitude-y with people. Ecspacially if they are on the "." ((a.k.a period)))|`|1FKQryQzaa	i find nothing wrong with that<br>  mehbe its you who wants to fight about everything and not her because that about me is nothing to agrue about.<br>  -Q|`|kZyfbt3aaa	I'm like her.<br>  Usually people like us:<br>  Are blunt<br>  Have had a fair amount of **** in the past<br>  Open<br>  Honest<br>  Forward<br>  Say what they think<br>  Liked by many<br>  But disliked by many too<br>  Very opinionated also.|`|9auKzop0aa	Wow, she's an idiot?<br>  This doesn't make since...

If it is really bothering you, talk to her about it, calmly.  If it continues to be a problem and you can't deal with it, it might be tough, but it might be time to move on.|`|b4ElCU3Gaa	she sounds like too much work. wait til she grows up and try dating her again. also, you bothare about to go through the changes that occur after high school, why dont you two just part and maybe find each other som later time.|`|yjKFRBwsaa	ummm, honestly she sounds like she likes drama and says she doesnt so people will start it with her.<br>  she sounds kind of backstabbing and kinda controlling.<br>  she's a keeper? =/<br>  <br>  if she is talking about you, dump her.|`|WQR0BoTlaa	She just sounds like an insecure drama queen that wants to pretend she is a bad ***.|`|ybOfRC1vaa	well she prolly just loves the drama because she gets attention|`|s9cT6yJIaa	If I was a boy with her, I would break up with her, I do not really know allot about this cause im in fifth grade!|`|pot7htk2aa	shes contradicting  herself|`|9e3mxs6waa	she's an attention seeker<br>  idk what your asking<br>  but to me it seems like she wants attention.|`|SZAGOYMYaa	Silly lady.

VSXUa9lraa	Break up.<br>  It's not going anywhere.<br>  No matter how you see each other now, it's not getting better any time soon and probably not later. You can't change him.
Zi2Sw3ngaa	well im not saying all guys will like that..but you should try to find a guy who well respect what you want too..and i know some guys like that..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|OQqAlHL8aa	I find it much more preferable. Yes it is appreciated.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	Hi there, , Maybe you should just try something new that you think is best.

b6a85743681931ecd3c430212d879f38aa	How many times do you want to ask the same question?
F3KkB4GWaa	Just chill maybe he's busy. Don't text him and see if he texts you first. Thats a way to see whether he wants to talk to you but he's busy or he's just being nice.|`|cFd00priaa	If he told you to text you, then chances are he texts somewhat often. Regardless, just be chill about it. Do not keep sending him text messages. You shouldn't have to pull teeth to spend time with him. The ball is in his court now.|`|1uIah3Z2aa	hiya, i think he will like you but probably just hasnt checked his phone or something. i mean i sometimes dont get texts until days after because of not looking at my phone or just bad signan and its the same with my friends and family. and like you say men dont really look at their phones much.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt worry. if he calls or texts you, great. if he doesnt, dont worry, he wasnt right for you.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. x|`|dJoE8yedaa	Let him text you next. Or once a week text ''Good morning. How are you? Have a lovely week.'' See if you get a response.<br>  <br>  Honestly though. Act like a guy. Make like you really don't care.
fL8QIhfyaa	Well maybe she turned down a guy for you and they want to get back at her by ruining her relationship. You need to talk to her and if you feel that she has changed and you can trust her than you have to give her the benefit of the doubt. Just tell her to be honest with you ..she was honest before and got help so obviously she wants to change. I would talk with her first before making any decisions!|`|td6WXhv4aa	If lots of guys are calling it's not a coincidence.
ZNe6B9TQaa	Because that's who he was all along.  It's his right and his choice to follow whatever path he pleases.  If it's not the path for you then it's time to officially say good bye.|`|CAhunDFnaa	He's acting like this bc of the influences at his work, or because he still loves you and dosent know how to express it/ depressed you broke up. So, now hes trying to get your attention! Tell him if he dosent change his ways then it just cant be, but if he changes into a new man,then together you will be!|`|ujAIyucOaa	maybe hes not over you yet maybe hes drinking and being mean to push the pain out of him <br>  <br>  OR hes trying to act cool and all that just to fit in trust me my ex use to be like that but once i talked to him and told him how i felt about everything he stopped everything and went back to the old him and now me and him are really close friends sometimes a little to close ha but who broke up with who? if you broke up with him then maybe hes not over you and never was but if he broke up with you then pretty much he might of thought he was over you but deep down hes not ha
lcWG9dj4aa	Try not to be noticeable, and kinda like bump into him or somehting.
PefglUNaaa	yea. but ya cant live without em!|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	Boys don't bring drama, you let it come. Think about it; unless they purposely stir up trouble, what do they do? You and your friends are the ones that stir it all up, and get into fights.
dJoE8yedaa	Put it in your past and forget about it. Flirt with him if you like him and see if he catches the hints. Good luck.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	If he's already said no & doesn't press the issue tomorrow, then don't worry - if he said no, but asks you tomorrow, then you'll need to panic. However, he probably knew you were drunk & maybe didn't think you weren't being serious. Say nothing til he approaches you. If you ask him first & he says no, you may end up feeling foolish.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	let it slide,don't booze, forget it, get on with your education|`|koynaDYbaa	Drinking is bad. See what mess it gets you in. Why do it??
92fNY4Fvaa	she obviously still likes this boy<br>  you need to tell her to back off, be firm about it. a lot of my friends flirt with my boyfriend too, but i don't really care because they have known each other longer then i have known him, but sometimes it gets out of hand, and thats when i step in and i'm like, kay, seriously, back the f*** off.<br>  you also need to tell your boyfriend to speak up, and he also needs to tell your friend that she needs to back off, otherwise she won't get it. and in certain situations where you SEE her getting to close, you need to go over to them, and tell her to back off, you can't just walk away and hide out until your boyfriend realizes your upset, you need to step up.  hes YOUR boyfriend, and you need to let her know that.<br>  and if she is a good friend, she will back off. if she doesn't maybe you need to re-evaluate your friendship.

fJ7OeopSaa	when you are ready you will know, if he is pressuring you he obviously does not respect you. just talk to him, if he dumps you its his loss there are better guys out there. I understand that you have been with him a while but you're only 15, I was in a similar situation when i was 15 and i went for it and i have always regretted it because I knew that he did not really respect me and my boyfriend was 18 so its a similar sort of thing. But despite what anyone tells you only you know how you feel, so go with your feelings, never do anything to please anyone else if you are uncomfortable about it.|`|XB996f1naa	if he really loves you he will wait until you are ready. if he dumps you that is his problem not yours.don't allow him to pressure you. stand up for yourself and may i suggest that nothing is wrong with being a virgin. most guys have alot of respect for girls that arent easy!|`|jQBM2AGkaa	DO NOT have sex just because you don't want him to dump you. If you're not ready, you're not ready. If he's a decent guy, he'll understand and respect that. If he doesn't, then you're better off with a guy who will!|`|NDqDFnGyaa	Don't do it girlfriend. Thats all I can say. Ha.|`|hQVteKFTaa	DO NOT DO IT!  If your parents found out he could be charged with statutory rape and would be a registered sex offender probably for life.|`|pT9iDrpZaa	just say your not ready. its not worth it to risk pregnancy and all that over a boyfriend. hes not worth it if he cant accept the fact you're not ready.|`|4rs0KXiTaa	its your own personal decision. Wouldn't you think if your boyfriend really loved you he'd understand? and if he didn't he just not the right guy for you. i deeply encourage you to wait.|`|1OwOOJVqaa	if he cant wait, he dont want u girly.<br>  tell the guy to wait huni, ur not reali..<br>  so wats the deal.. tell him ur not ready <br>  <br>  and again, if he cant wait, he dont want u girly.

That's a great sign that she won't have sex with you.  It means she's a respectable person.  Don't base a relationship on sex.  <br>  <br>  Not Danielle because it doesn't sound like you like her as much as Vanessa.<br>  Not Taylor because she sounds like a jerk, especially to you, and who wants to date a jerk?<br>  <br>  P.S. putting people's full names and pictures on the internet, ESPECIALLY when they haven't given you permission.... is WRONG and just begging some rapist to find out who they are and where they live.|`|u5y8kE81aa	i agree with Gumbski|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	do all of them even want you?<br>  do any of them want you?<br>  <br>  you seem to be going on about the first one the most though.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I recommend the 1st one.|`|wztEAVm2aa	if they ever found out you were doing this, you wouldnt be able to date any of them.|`|md66E0LWaa	what makes you think any of them would ever date you!!|`|gVOeroPeaa	all of them at the same time XD<br>  <br>  <br>  jk jk, but if your up to it, dat-=legend XD<br>  <br>  um, id say the 1st one, becayse chances are, the fact that she doesnt wanna do it means she has a lot of sexually repressed energy, and is a freak in bed XD and you talk highly of her, so you must like her|`|KUtMtctdaa	I will say girl number 1.

Oo3PC1yQaa	I sometimes wear quite a bit of eye makeup, and I don't think it's slutty at all.

It depends what it looks like on you but in most cases yeah. Just put less make-up on, ain't hard you don't need much on to be honest (well I'm guessing that's the case anyway).|`|W6o3UQLkaa	i wouldn't consider it slutty but its not really attractive|`|IrZP7wXkaa	It depends how you wear it.  If it looks like you don't even have any eyes, it's too much!  But if you wear a lot but it just enhances your eyes or they still look like eyes, then I would say you're ok.  It's hard to know without seeing a picture though.|`|vBqIRHppaa	no.thats what make-up is there for,for you to wear it...<br>  be yourself,most people look stupid with a lotttt of makeup but if you can pull it off and you think you look and you know your not a slut then who gives a f*ck what people think<br>  you only live once<br>  :]<br>  <3|`|XB996f1naa	i am a woman but i have found that most guys do not like much makeup. i think that wearing alot makes you look desperate for a man<br>  and yes it can look slutty.|`|VZVGXRyraa	Some guys like it...i don't really though.

What feels like love to one person may be nothing more than attraction to another. Some people fall in and out of love quickly and often while others are never really in love as much as they are in lust. This can get confusing when you are a teen because romantic love is a relatively new concept for you and you don't know what to expect. You are overwhelmed with all sorts of new feelings and social pressures. They are confusing. What is love? What makes you want a romantic relationship with one person and not another? How does your heart choose a partner? Why does love end? These questions can't be easily answered.<br>  <br>  One of the most confusing quasi-love feelings is lust. Lust is a very powerful, very intense feeling of physical attraction toward another person. Lust is mainly sexual in nature - the attraction is superficial based on instant chemistry rather than genuine caring. Usually we lust after people we do not know well, people we still feel comfortable fantasizing about. It is very common for people to confuse lust for love. But why? What is it about lust and love that make them so easy to mix up? If lust is all about sex, how can a relationship without sex be about lust? Teens struggle with this because they see lust in the Biblical sense, but lust isn't that sinister. Lust is about physical attraction and acting ONLY on physical attraction. Love is about much more than that. Yet many teens (and to be fair, many adults) confuse an intense attraction for some sort if divine love. For teens, since feelings of attraction are still new and since pop-culture sells sex and love as one package, it is very easy to get the two mixed up.<br>  <br>  Lust is clearly not love. Love is based on more than just physical attraction. Sure, attraction is a factor, but love goes deeper than that. Love is based on caring, friendship, commitment and trust. When you are in love it is as if you have your best most trusted friend at your side AND you feel physically attracted to them. It is the best of both worlds! Love is a shared feeling between two people who have a vested interest in one anothers happiness. Love is not about jealousy. It is not about conflict. It is not about testing. Love is a positive feeling. If it is tainted by mistrust, jealousy, insecurity or spitefulness it is not really love but merely a pale copy. Love is the total surrender of your heart to another person with the security of knowing they will treat it better than you will. Love should feel good. It should not feel bad. Love should make you want to be a better person, it should not lead you to do something self destructive. Love is not demanding of your spirit but lifts it and makes it glow. Love is a good thing. Anything less is lust, deep friendship or attraction. So the sappiness aside, the question remains, how can you tell you are in love?<br>  <br>  There is no easy way to find the truth behind your feelings or the feelings of another person but there are some tell-tale signs that love is blooming (or growing deeper). If you agree with 7 of the following 9 statements you are probably in love.<br>  <br>     1. You know, because you have been told by your significant other, that your deep feelings are returned in kind.<br>     2. The object of your affections makes you feel special and good about yourself.<br>     3. If/when you feel jealous it is always fleeting; you trust your partner not to betray you or hurt your relationship.<br>     4. Nothing makes you feel as serene as when you and your partner are together.<br>     5. When you fight with your partner you usually make up within a few hours and you always agree that nothing is more important than you both being able to express your true feelings (even if they sometimes cause conflict).<br>     6. Your partner never asks you to choose between him/her and your loyalties to your family and friends - if you do choose him/her over them you always have a good reason and it is always YOUR decision, and your decision alone.<br>     7. Neither you or your partner feel the need to test the other's loyalties or feelings.<br>     8. You are more yourself when with your partner than you are with anybody else.<br>     9. If sex is part of your relationship it is by mutual desire and agreement without the slightest hint of commitment testing or persuasion.|`|R7yEdcm8aa	It will suck like heck and when your in your 90's you wont even mind changing his diapers|`|VpTUFKXiaa	Love is when you feel strongly about that person but before you fall in love, you have to know if they really love you back by spending alot of time with them and just bonding..you feel love when you know you'd cry over that person and when you realize that they really like being around you and help you whenever you need it no matter what! like a best friend! hope this helps! :]|`|xkY8y7gvaa	If all you want to do is be with that person, or if you cant stop thinking about that person, even if your with them.

But if she talks to you about it, go with it and open up. Just act like there isn't any awkwardness. That's how I do it. I just pretend it never happened. Just pretend you guys are still friends.

A realistic relationship. A person with a mind can stimulate a relationship to go alot further than the other choice. You have to think what if you go blind. I still feel the attraction. You can say what if  you go deaf. Well I'd want more than really hot.|`|LKsl00CTaa	Guys first notice someone who flirts with them and is somewhere between relatively ok looking, to HOT. so yea, if you flirt, you're in there.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|ey8aWCPUaa	Funny and ditzy are not opposites, at all.|`|rbtO73eZaa	funny and ok if she was hot and a so called ditz then she'd get annoying after a while|`|W6o3UQLkaa	Funny, but not dumb, and ok looking.

I said more than I've ever loved any guy. He was happy with the answer because he knew it was true.
ZGlewXRAaa	I mean, there's no real way to immediately just drop the issues that you think you have. I have a friend just like you who thinks she is really awkward and gets really shy around guys. I, being her good friend, sat her down and talked to her and asked her why she thought this as. As you could imagine things got really emotional and she cried a lot but she made real progress. Now, she is one of the most vibrant and caring people I know. I say this all to say that I think you need to just open up and talk about it. Maybe this will lessen the stress you feel because of these attributes. Hope this helps!|`|K6GXc6R6aa	what i usually do to forget about an awkward moment that just happened to me is think about an embarrassing moment that happened me or someone else<br>   and think about a funny movie that made u crack up laughing or any moment that made you laugh when u were with ur friends...just keep ur mind clouded with good thoughts and soon it will fade away and it will be something you think about when ur older and laugh about it|`|rDmxHRGjaa	Don't ask just take initiative|`|2h4eetekaa	try downing a few beers before you go out|`|QfYGhtVwaa	It is all about blagging - make like you are confident even when you feel you are not. You have proved that you can get away with it by asking him to dance!  <br>  <br>  The bump and grind thing is a  bit full on and surprising to me (in the UK), especially as 'our little group were on a guy', this changes my view a little and makes me think that maybe you should not get too involved with someone so comfortable doing such an intimate - sort of - dance with a group of other school children. Sounds a bit yukky and wrong!
C62IdsO8aa	My suggestion is to go with a group. Talk to your friends and her friends and plan to go next weekend or something. Then the only thing you have to worry about is finding the seat next to her when your there.|`|7342BXehaa	talk to a group of friends about seeing a movie, and ask her first than who ever in the group
KHJ6zzp4aa	Get to know her, Compliment her, Start conversations sit nxt to her in class im 13 to and a girl lol<br>  Hope i helped :)|`|td6WXhv4aa	Get to know her talk to her and go slow don't rush it.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	Ask about school, projects, teachers, books, then say 'X film sound really good, what do you say we go and watch it?'|`|HNAVlwV7aa	get to know her by going over to her, saying hi, introduce yourself. compliment her and ask her stuff about herself. not too much, but that's the idea. flirt, but not too much to freak her out.<br>  <br>   then u ask her out.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|W6o3UQLkaa	get to know her a little first, not too much though, so you dont become good friends and so youll still have lots to talk about when you ask her out|`|rUMGPXqwaa	yeah you definitely want to get to know her. start by just asking her to hang out and friends and become FRIENDS FIRST.|`|o0VcjSN9aa	you should add her on msn, make some small talk first. then over msn or phone, you can say " hey do you wanna go see a movie sometime?" and then if she says yes that is a clue she likes you. Therefore, you should get to know her a little bit. You can go on dates to get to know each other, so therefore hang out once and then go ahead and ask her out.|`|g1zTzT6Kaa	First of all, at 13, your relationships are not serious anyways, so either way would not be a bad choice. However, depending on who the girl is, I would get to know her because later on, you might decide you don't even like her anymore.|`|dAd2o6udaa	ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS get to know the girl first. the first rule that my sister told me about dating is, that you have to become a friend before you become a boyfriend. It makes the relationship stronger. just talking to her and asking her about herself can get things going.|`|TBd8B96Haa	if you have a phone and so does she just text thats the best way to get to know her and i agree with the other guy u need to get to know her but u cant become good really close friends... and f.y.i. cheesy pick up lines such as"i lost my phone number can i have yours" never work|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	Get to know her first. Otherwise you would freak her out.|`|KNFsnrUcaa	get to know her

FyqCMrCdaa	Easy and convenient. And guys don't have to worry about being nervous or what not...personally i think its lame. :)|`|Nb78LtG9aa	1. So he doesn't have to deal with the awkwardness if you reject him.<br>  2. He might be nervous... and he's afraid he'll mess up while asking you.<br>  3. It's easier and saves stress.<br>  4. It's quick and it won't seem corny if he asks you in person.<br>  <br>  Stupid right? But you have to admit it is easier.
d16sM2iOaa	Yeah. I wish some girls were much more aggresive in regards to things like this. Guys seem to be labeled as the ones who have to make the decisions and stuff, but I don't know... personally I don't like to have all that control.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	There's no set rule to this if you like a guy just ask him out what can you lose|`|s9cT6yJIaa	I don't think that's weird cause all the boys are so shy to ask me out! I asked MY boyfriend out! He's really not so bad either. We both LOVE to go skateboarding.
JJCSEe3Taa	See if he does make the first move on Monday if he doesn't by the end of the day just ask him out. You know he likes you and you have been friends with him for 2 years so you don't need to act cool anymore if you know what I mean.
TthDWtPTaa	if she funny
VXQFT341aa	Dump him if it makes you that uncomfortable. Tell him how you feel. If he wont listen then send him packing.|`|EIsnATLxaa	End the relationship obviously|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Your guy needs to be clued in. You are jail bait. Tell him to shape up or ship out.|`|VP7KAe12aa	If you feel uncronfrotable and if you told him NO it's illegal if he does have sex with you.<br>  Talk to him if he still wants to have sex with you and pressuring you to have it with him then he's not a good BF. <br>  Get out of the relationship before anything bad happens<br>  Rebekka|`|sA2SAkd9aa	you need to break up with the boy,tell his parents and, talk to your parents about it .this sounds serious ..you are in my prayers|`|6rl8IQCraa	hahaha dump him, hes a jerk
gywXHuGCaa	just the tomboy and the sports would be enough lol although 13 would be too young for me... i'm 16...<br>  <br>  yea i would like you! <br>  <br>  If you could kickflip :P|`|wlVqU2EBaa	Well, your boyfriend should like you, and that should be why he's dating you, right??|`|qy07K2k5aa	I can't tell really.|`|MVqiulXcaa	Wow. <br>  Well obviously, is he is your BOYFRIEND he should like you. -_-<br>  Some people. Are quite ... dumb.<br>  :P|`|gYuJUyvvaa	You're a bit young so I'd say no on that note.<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  If you was older, I wouldn't mind a GF who would be willing to try kick my *** at Halo ;)
LtIhkOWiaa	I sure do! I've been out with a few female skateboarders and they are the best :D|`|lbgoHgDkaa	i like girls that are more on the feminine side, but i'm sure there are some guys who do like a tomboy
IikTFnCxaa	Quit wasting her time and yours...Tell her marriage isn't in the cards for you right now, and that you aren't ready. If you don't want her, then tell her that you aren't ready for a serious relationship and you want to date other people.|`|j4rirb8laa	Tell her.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	get rid of her|`|AA11899313	''Disturbing'' you for marriage!<br>  <br>  See a lawyer, have a Court injunction taken out against this behaviour.<br>  <br>  I'd take her to Court and sue her.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|pqMb1jsKaa	Her sister.|`|AA10328947	your right she's a girl , marry a WOMAN instead., not a girl
XH2o1MM6aa	.Fantasy.|`|EXM1nHNFaa	well, you appear young, so ill answer accordingly. Well you see, there isnt anything wrong with you being attracted to a female. At a certain point in a boys life, those girls that used to have "kooties" will start to look more...fun.<br>  <br>  One thing you must know though lad. Dont go grabbing what you see and are curious about on a whim.
TthDWtPTaa	you don't
9Ah2Z4HGaa	Well its because guys like us are curious and our hormones kicks in quick. Guys likes the looks. They would look at the girls eyes and see what he thinks of you. If he is interested he would stare at your boobs then so on to your butt. So we basic-ly we like big boobs because we judge girls by looks if we don't know them.|`|mxVAdEfSaa	Medium are good to i guess but i dont like small|`|qAcrK4KTaa	Well its middle school so I dont think anyone knows what to like yet. But Big Boobs have always been "In" and for a good reason. Its better to have plenty than to need more. Not to mention a Big Rack just makes you look damn hawt. As long as you didnt get the rack and stomach dont match.|`|SoarXprOaa	I will answer your question, I am just a freshman in high school and I remember that when I was in middle school I enjoyed boobs of almost all sizes but the extreme really small or really large. I say boobs are just great no matter the size or shape. Small, show 'em off, huge, show 'em off still. Wear low cut tops, let them hang out. That's what I think.|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Guys don't usually come to this section, honey. And it's the same reason you like toned abs. Because it's attractive.<br>  If you were a guy, would an A cup turn you on? Leave behind all the "personality counts" bull and really think about it.|`|cIaqcI8Qaa	lol i dunno rofl personally i like small to big and there might be a guy on the other side of those mellonz
9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	Its part of life, how you deal with it will make you a stronger person.  You can only learn from your experiences, and hopefully not repeat your mistakes.<br>  Chin up kiddo!|`|mefxIQP9aa	No, it happens to a lot of people.<br>  <br>  You just have to learn how to control your jealousy or you'll never be happy.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, it's a lot to handle for someone of 25.|`|DNwHGeEtaa	People get jealous all the time when they are in love. Nothing is wrong with that as long as you're not unreasonably jealous. And no, 2 heart-breaks by the age of 25 is not a lot. I'm only 21, I got 3 already. I've never got dumped, but my heart was broken. So compared to me, you're doing ok.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	You are not a bad person. I have had 3 heartbreaks and there is nothing you can do. Everyone gets jealous at some point or other that is completely normal.|`|VSXUa9lraa	Two by twenty-five?<br>  That's nothing.<br>  Depends on the jealousy- did you have a reason? Did you give the other party a reason?|`|GCpnuPNCaa	no dont worry they just wernt the one for you...  whenever im sad over relation ships i remmber when im ready for love God will introduce me to the person im ment to be with :)
3lVuNfLMaa	From a girl!<br>  <br>  1) look nice<br>  2) no cheesy chat up lines<br>  3) talk to her as a friend<br>  4) dont be pushy<br>  5) as her for her number <br>  6) smell nice<br>  7) compliment her<br>  <br>  If i think of anymore i will edit
gLfqJwgqaa	the same thing happens to me!<br>  <br>  it takes a while and you still have feelings for him probably|`|KRvaDYNraa	you may think you aren't but you are still emotionally attached to him
QODJNf1oaa	He likes you, but before you were too available for him to be able to realize his feelings. Once you stopped talking to him as much, he most likely saw how much he liked talking to you & saw you in a different light. So I just would continue doing what your doing because it's working.|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	if a boy wants to date you, he will make it very clear.  just like a girl would, its the same rule with each sex. if you have to "figure" it out then the answer is no.  sorry hun.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I Love these stories, keep 'em coming!|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	ok <br>  its hard to tell <br>  but i think he does and just said he doesn't for his friends to leave him alone <br>  <br>  just tlk to him, open ur mind|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	he didnt lyk u at first that much..well he prob did jus got tired of ppl askin him stuf bout u.....wen u laid off he missed talkin 2 ya. yea i say he does|`|J11d9lxxaa	That's tough lol. Well giving him more space seems like a good idea...but he may just be into the chase...like he's now interested because he can't have you but the moment you start showing interest he could start pulling away again. Give it time and don't rush into anything yet, see where it goes. GOOD LUCK!|`|gNeFtZdBaa	GET A LIFE LOVERS= NO LIFE|`|DE1pTaBFaa	yeah he like you my mom says when boys make fun of you they mostly like you

"Yours" dont let a bunch of D-Bags make you feel uncomfortable. if you find you are, its not like anyone is forcing you to make out of be in public.<br>  <br>  Realize the value of yourself and your companion then compare it to theirs. Im no math wiz, but I can surely see 1 of those are > than the other.

Definately more. She just isn't ready to cut your cousin loose yet.
opH5l5z8aa	if you think and feel  you are ready, go for it.<br>  just make sure hes the right one to be your first :)|`|VSXUa9lraa	Depends on your morals; if you're willing to have sex before you're married or even in a relationship, go for it I guess.

Let him make the next move and see what happens.|`|OntO6wE4aa	Do you feel sorry?  Express what you feel. It's evident that you've hit the comfort zone in your relationship. The no matter what I do she'll be there place. If you haven't been together long then move along. Your not that important any more. What ever you have he only wants it when he wants it. I don't see much happiness happening for you. If you can't let him go, then your going have to be a little more independent yourself.

That would work on me.|`|1aBwInjMaa	It depends on what happened to make you send that text ?<br>  Your anger would naturally be exagerated anyway , so he should understand.<br>  However you seem to feel guilty ? If this is right do apologize , maybe he feels bad anyway for what he has done.<br>  If he loves you , he will understand.|`|K8shRjphaa	don't you dare say anything else to him, i know its hard, depending on how much you care about him, but he needs to know that you mean business and whenever you get mad your not going to say sorry :)<br>  good luck|`|c1yt66wNaa	Say your sorry, but in person. Be honest and tell him what your are really feeling, DO NOT EXAGGERATE. Sometimes, people can sense when you are lying.

TthDWtPTaa	if she gives oral
mtzJXhIjaa	talk to her more! connect with her on a personal level and find out what she's interested in. girl's appreciate it when boys seem interested in their lives. once you two have found out what eachothers interests are, hangout! if she mentions she likes bowling for example, be like "oh hey we should go bowling sometime!"|`|prqE3Tthaa	i think she likes you but doesnt want you to know out of embarassment. [not embarassed of you (of course) cause she doesnt want to get her heart broken] she prolly likes you though. FLRIT WITH HER!!! it helps boost confidence...GOOD LUCKKK
o3d3NBVzaa	Not a lady, but in my perspective, she probably doesn't like to do it. She may have been doing it to impress/hang on to you.<br>  <br>  My ex used to go down on me when we first started dating, and then stopped after a while.

Good luck.|`|28UJA6FQaa	basically. dont be clingy, & play hard to get ;]<br>  :)<br>  if you kissed him before, & things are still fresh, garunteed you;ll get kissed again.<br>  but make sure your not hangingout with your friends while your with him, he wont kiss you infront of friends :)

Wear something that alot of people say " you look good in that...ect" And when you talk ask question but not too many to show that your interested in them and keep the topic on them until they ask about you. For example: do you like football? what is your favorite team?" The point of this is to seek a something in common between the two of you guys. Then once you do just share what you agree and disagree on. Finally at the end exchange numbers or if you already have call or text them later and let them know you enjoyed their company.|`|AA10534526	Ah seriously? You have to ask us? Just wear what you normally wear and act like you normally act because in the long run, IF he does like you, you'll be acting like someone you're not. Also freaking out doesn't help. Just do what you want and don't listen to anyone here. It won't help. You may end up making yourself look like a total loser by following some of these people's advice.|`|J5onMZPiaa	Just look really nice. be yourself and be funny. make her feel comfortable but don't come off as desperate.

Not too fancy like at dances, but not too "tough" or it'll make him not attracted to you.<br>  <br>  Talking:<br>  As far as I know, talking is the hardest part of relationships. Don't try to be too into sports but look up or research some info so you aren't totally clueless. Talk to him about interests of you and him. See if they are alike. What does he like to do in his spare time. What are some of his opinions on matters that could be discussed. Don't try to change your opinions on things unless you have a good reason. Also, be yourself because many people I know that have went on dates, changed and scared off their date. Of course I know this isn't a date, but a casual meeting.<br>  <br>  Try your best but don't be too needy. Don't try to stalk him, but exchange a smile once and a while and when you are ready, talk to him. I'm sure you'll do good. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck.<br>  <br>  -Q1|`|BCHdNmjdaa	Clothes:<br>  Wear the teams colors or jersey with a pair of jeans and just any shoes except for high heels or fancy stuff. Things like ballet flats and cute runners would be nice. <br>  <br>  Conversations:<br>  Talk about football, social life, favourites, stuff like that. One thing to stay away from is yes or no questions. Talk about stuff that you can keep talking about. For example: Whats your favourite NHL, NFL team. Then say your favourite and compare. Then talk about the awesome players and the awesome goals they made. But if your not a sport person, talk about Idols, or i dunno singers, actors, people like that. <br>  <br>  I hope you do great, and make an awesome first impression ( if it is the first)<br>  <br>  Lexie|`|RlrthRrbaa	Don't dress too slutty. Wear a flattering t-shirt or something. Otherwise you might scare him off. <br>  <br>  Talk about whatever comes to mind. Don't talk sports if you don't know about it. DON'T FORGET TO SMILE!!! OFTEN!!! (But not constantly of course. Smiling makes people like you.) (Brush your teeth before.)<br>  <br>  Um, get a seat next to him? Then watch for the following signs:<br>  1.Does he say your name a lot?<br>  2. Does he point his feet/ pelvis towards you?<br>  3. Does he smile at you a lot?<br>  4. Are his pupils dilated (larger) when they look at you?<br>  5. Does he touch you a lot?<br>  <br>  If the answer is yes, then he likes you back. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. ;)<br>  <br>  (Oh, and call his name, if his head whips around really quickly he likes you.)|`|DE1pTaBFaa	ask how he likes school and tell him about yourself and stuff like that <br>  <br>  wear this top:<br>  <a href="http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.aspx?prod=146343212&ctlg=020_Girls&cid=1061&source=1&size=" rel="nofollow">http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.as...</a><br>  <br>  wear these jeans:<a href="http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.aspx?prod=140928810&ctlg=020_Girls&cid=1073&source=1&size=" rel="nofollow">http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.as...</a><br>  <br>  wear these shoes:<a href="http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.aspx?prod=410096110&ctlg=020_Girls&cid=1085&source=1&size=" rel="nofollow">http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.as...</a>|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	Wear what you would normally wear to a football game.

x4HwY3Nwaa	I was 13 when I had my first kiss, and it was incredibly cute but awkward. The neighbor kid kissed me at a bonfire, while we were looking at the stars =) But it ended up awkward. Its perfectly normal to feel nervous, but the best thing to do is just go for it. It needs to happen sometime right?|`|LS8LcuRaaa	12 - He just kissed me. Kissing comes naturally, so don't worry too much about it, when it happens you'll know what to do.|`|azIJoIdIaa	I was 17.  It was in my car, after this formal dance (NOT PROM) we'd been to.

1CRbzkABaa	This is going to be an interesting situation. Right now she is very confused about what she did and about her feelings. Right after she kissed you she probably loved the feeling of being cared about and is the reason she thought it was special. Girls tend to make excuses when there not sure what to do. Just reinforce to her how much fun you had. Do you drive and have a car? In order to begin winning her over we have to know what your working with : ).|`|6C1oSVu3aa	you should just find out her favorite band. buy the tickets and take her. she would totally go....<br>  <br>  i go to shows like every month and im in high school<br>  <br>  i would die if a guy bought me tickets to one of my favorite artists ;]

4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Your crush makes her uncomfortable b/c she has a boyfriend. But she's an attention whore and wants to be loved by everyone. She wants your attention, despite not being interested. If you start giving off a vibe of friendship, not romance, then she would probably embrace the friendship, but she must be happy enough w/ her current relationship to decline opportunities to actually start something w/ you.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you don't want to hear this, but for the record I think it's a bad idea to date co-workers and a bad idea to ask out girls who you know  have a boyfriend.|`|sNNnAZDSaa	may be she is a p***k tease
eg2ajXiXaa	Woman can sometimes be naturally friendly to other guys and flirtatious towards different men without realizing they have lead you on. From the other angle men often over assume the tendencies of women to be attracted to them when it is just friendly conversation. If she is a naturally outward extroverted person it could just be the way she interacts with others. Be careful you don't want to give her the wrong impression and ruin your work relationship, or give the impression your interested in her. It could make both of you extremely uncomfortable at work. You have to remember she goes home to her partner everyday, a part of her life you don't see. Work is a part of her life her partner doesn't see and therefore she could act more flirtatious at work without worrying about hurting her significant other.|`|c6g92RRVaa	she probably wants to be your friend but you don't get the message and are only trying to get into her pants. she is allowed to say hello to you maybe she is trying to keep her distance because of her boyfriend|`|dJoE8yedaa	Oh Andy T!

TthDWtPTaa	talk to him
5SyjY5RNaa	okay, one--do not listen to other people! i made that mistake and almost destroyed my pretty much perfect relationship. the majority of the answers you are going to see are going to say its wrong, discusting, irresponsible, ect. ect.  however, i guarentee you barely any of them have had personal experience with the situation.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend turned 21 in september, I turn 17 in may. Four and a half age difference. We've been dating for five months, he asked me out a bit after he turned 21. We tried for a while "waiting" for me to be old, and just staying really good friends. But when the chemistry is there and you really like a person as much as we love each other our relationship was inevitable. I would not ask is it wrong for a 16 year old to date a 21 year old.  Age honestly is just a number.  People are going to judge, and it really is hard to face their criticism.. But if you think your relationship can work then go for it!  <br>  <br>  However, dont go into this relationship blindly.  He is much older than you regardless meaning that you are jail bait for him.  Having an intimate physical relationship is definately questionable right away. Make sure he's into you for you and not just your body.  Make sure he is a gentleman to you always and that he is going to treat you right because if he doesn't I guarentee you can fine plenty of nicer boys with much less complications.<br>  <br>  Dont let what other people think control your life. Some of my friends have tried to break up me and my boyfriend because they think its wrong. Its not up to anyone but you because it is your life. Just be careful with it.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions feel free to contact me :)|`|Ek00D5kOaa	yikes!! =/ careful|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	no.
x8LBArCuaa	What should I do to get her to like me?<br>  (ask your self what is it to like about you)<br>  There is this girl I see in the lunch room everyday. I think she is Absolutely beautiful. <br>  <br>  (Beauty is skin deep and short lived)<br>  <br>  I've never talked to her, and have never talked to any girls, except for friends.<br>  <br>  (Will try talking more to and even dating your friends who are girls, pick a few number one-type-looking girls to date and work your way up to this lunch time beauty of yours, my friend)<br>   <br>  I know a first impression is the most important part in any "relationship"<br>  <br>  (The first impression is not the most important impression my friend. I once met a nun out side a bank that was being robbed. My first impression of her was non-combative virgin. While her virginity was never investigated I was, later that day, forced to change my 1st impression of her after watching her single handedly beat two men, wearing ski mask, to a pulp.)<br>  <br>   I get nervous to the point where I am red as a tomato. She is a sophomore, and I am a freshman. <br>  <br>  (This age difference will only work against you if you are not able to convince her that you are worth while. try writing down a list of 50 reasons why she would want you. than pick the top ten. Than be honest and erase the five or so total exaggerations and focus on the real top qualities that you do have to offer her. Share these qualities with others and when your confidence has risen share yourself with her as well.) <br>  <br>  I really want to talk to her, but i am super afraid to (I get like a five year old is to a "monster" under the bed).<br>  <br>  Do not be afraid nor do I advice you to rush in, take your time, breath and please relax, my friend.<br>  <br>   I don't even know if she already has a boyfriend. <br>  <br>  (This does not matter. If she feels you’re worth it she will leave who ever she is with to be with you. The only thing you must know is YOU, rather or not you are worth it. Once you know this it is simply a matter of showing her, my friend)<br>  <br>  My fears have already let 2 possible girlfriends slip away. <br>  <br>  (The third one’s the charm)<br>  <br>  I don't even know if she already has a boyfriend. <br>  <br>  (you’ve already said that, my friend, remember, it does not matter)<br>  <br>  I really don't want to lose this one too. <br>  <br>  (You have not even captured it, to lose it, my friend. do not worry so, again breath, relax.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Her one friend is in my Science class, is she someone i should ask questions about her to? Please help Me!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  For now keep away from her friend. Do as I told you above. Eventually you will have to jump in the pool or go home. The winner is not the man who slept in an hour longer, or the one who said, “tomorrow, perhaps tomorrow”…. the winner is the one who went for it while it was there to get.

At the beginning of the year she came in looking absolutely beautiful, all of my friends were fawning over her, so I thought there was no way in hell I could ever be with her. Just so happens that I was really good friends with one of her really good friends. I told him how I felt, and he told me that I should tell her because she had also been talking about me. I told her everything and now I'm happy to say I'm in the best relationship of my life. So, don't be scared, just say EXACTLY how you feel and who knows what could happen!|`|NuRDVj9aaa	you shouldn't ask you friend you will look to desperate, just talk to her and take the chance. Or even get to know her friend well enough to hang out with her and her friends ( the girl you like) that way you will get to know her and she will get to know you, and who knows were it might end up.|`|TR91FM5Faa	Ya ask her friend about her. It's a good way to get to know more about her before you talk to her|`|kDyj5d7laa	Yea. talk to the girl in your science class.<br>  If she is in your lunch, casually bump into her. Litteraly. lol. Not hard or anything. lol.<br>  Just say sorry i didnt see you there. And say something like "your laura right?" idont know if that is her name, but you get what i am saying. start a conversation with her. <br>  good luck :)
FZQ2KHDvaa	No, You have missed the window of time, in which the marriage could have been annulled.<br>  <br>  If she did not continue the sexual promiscuity after the wedding, then you have no grounds for divorce on that, either.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	You sound like one very weird sort of guy!  You married her because she was not promiscuous - funny reason that if that was the only reason.  Now after 25 years ago you want the marriage annulled because she was actually promiscuous.  Even if she was, what the hell does it matter after 25 years for goodness sake.|`|AA11404742	Who knows?  You don't tell us where you are, so nobody here can do more than guess what the rules might be in your state, or country, or province.<br>  <br>  You'll do better to consult with an attorney or lawyer or barrister or whatever passes for one wherever you live.|`|CQsD09D6aa	No. I know that you are hurting but maybe counseling would help. Has she been faithful during the 25 years of marriage? Try to let her past be her past. Maybe he knew that you would not marry her if she told the truth. Look at how upset you are after 25 years.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	annulment   means a marriage  never exists..|`|0HUHHzIQaa	No.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	you cant have a marriage annulled after a certain amount of time or after you have consummated the relationship so i would assume that in 15 yrs you've had sex at least once? then id say no not a possibility, you would have to file for divorce.|`|Ncad6d57aa	Check your state laws. But if you are a man whore, even if you told her you were, you could become victim to the clean hands doctrine which pretty much means, well... she deceived you but you aren't perfect either.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	good luck in finding a court or lawyer to help you with that, there is a limitation of this I am sure you have passed that point sorry. just get a regular divorce, but under these reasons ok
pDqsFgjyaa	yeah, sounds like you kinda put him on the spot and he got too nervous haha... he'll probably come back with a yes, but he could also be scared of you :P|`|G0U2ExOSaa	probably no|`|sr4BAblpaa	He might be over you-or he might be into someone else who may or may not be into him-or he's just waiting for the right time-but I don't suggest texting too much because when you can't show emotions well in text messages, people can get the wrong idea...Give him some time to work it out by himself-then see where it goes from there. (: good luck|`|2j84hXguaa	Yah I think he does.  He just feels like being the guy he needs to have a plan.  Hes talking about thinking up what to do so you wont think hes wishy washy.  Sit quiet and wait.|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	He maybe about how he likes you (friend or more than friend). He could also be thinking about things you 2 could do together or places to take you. Hard to say without knowing him.|`|4pKIllAeaa	he is probably stressed out with life<br>  he may have some issues and problems<br>  try having a deep talk with him<br>  figure out what's going on|`|oi6eHkPzaa	I can see why you're confused. First thing you need to realise is he's lucky to have a bonnie wee lass like yourself taking an interest in him. Second, if he's not said aye straight away then, sorry honey, he's trying to mess with your head. Don't let him. Stay true to yourself and choose someone who REALLY wants to be with you. Good Luck!!|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Ya he wants to go out, but maybe some other girl told him he was cute or something and he has to like tell her he'd rather be with you. Y'all will probably go out. Unless he gets mad or something. Don't make him mad.|`|DI0a82Y7aa	He wants to explore other things so i would just move the heck on! But im serious.|`|cNX8jV2Waa	he just needs to make a choice, there's nothing u can do about it, once he gives u an answer, then i wud b asking questions|`|Ta24cVD5aa	i think he has another girl in mind he might like..ur still in hs..guys never know what they want so get use to it trust me girl..u should keep ur options open|`|zsn7lrThaa	No, Move on. He is not into you.|`|ZX9HeOuyaa	i think he just wants to have to think. do u know if his parents let him date?|`|TwqXWU82aa	sweetie..im having the same problem. just move on, like i did.|`|7qIFUYZeaa	YES, I think he still wants to go out. <br>  <br>  Maybe if you both didn't talk in 'txt language' and actually spelled out words such as 'what instead of wut', 'and or & instead of n' , you would understand each other.  This language butchering makes you look uneducated, which is a turnoff.|`|fN8Js8aeaa	Maybe he needs some time to think about the ups and downs with having a gf in his life right now.  Hes also gonna wanna talk to his guy friends and get their advice.  But it sounds like you're off to a good start.<br>  Best of luck =]|`|WvZHrBfxaa	Well , it depends . Guys can never make the right decisions . So , maybe he needs to think it through . & Trust me , guys are confusing as heckkk ! But he probably does want to go out with you . It all dependss .|`|yLDSMxr0aa	It means he wants some time to think, which probably means no. Sorry.<br>  <br>  Guys generally know if they like a girl from the start.|`|hf5RgDzwaa	well if he needs so time give him a little bit but dont let him take forever cuz then hes over thinking it and if hes over thinking it something might be wrong|`|IuWA5wXzaa	Just move on but still be nice to him. Because if you have a grudge against him, it will end badly.|`|cgGJ1Qfjaa	it either means that he isn't into you or he is stressed out and doesn't need the pressure of a girlfriend....|`|noWUvMZQaa	IT MIGHT BUT U SHOULD NOT PRESSURE HIM! PUT HIM AT EASE
ey8aWCPUaa	Maybe he likes to get drunk, and likes to have sex, and putting those two together are fun for him.<br>  <br>  But eh, guys are stupid and reckless and like to do stupid and reckless things to have fun.<br>  <br>  Drunk sex isn't really that great though.|`|AA11108018	Get drunk have fun and have all the sex you can handle.  How ever be careful make sure that no one can get into the room with you or is in there when get there|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	thats hilarious. It is quite possible he is getting bored though. might want to try and spice it up a bit :)|`|SZAGOYMYaa	Silly lady. What's your number?
jcLcZxBraa	Uhh I think it is possible, but it feels soo much better without clothes on. And you will know when she is like breathing hard and moaning or she just knows :)|`|8G0PhjlPaa	yes it is possilbe...she will def know and you could prob tell by her facial expression or if she is making any sound otherwise she would prob just tell you.
YbnEr1z7aa	well your lucky my jeans suck..... but i've been told it will when you get older.... and 5 is average.....|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Ok you need to calm down becuase an average of erect is 6 I think, If not go to www.google.com and find out your self! LOL If a girl is going to have sex with you and decides not to becuase of your size then you shouldn't be with that person, Becuase after all its not the size its how you use it ::P|`|AA11108018	Well if it does not you can always be known as<br>  Needle dick the bed bug F**ker if that's  not enough for her than she must as deep as the grand Canyon|`|BeY1ujJpaa	grows till your 21, dont smoke!! tiz bad 4 size!!
AA10338846	Yes...esp if she is a redhead and looks like Kate Walsh!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Oh yes, ASK ME PLEASE ASK ME<br>  <br>  Guys aren't really cowards cause of this, surveys show that most if not all men would rather be in combat (as in full on war) rather than approach a woman.<br>  <br>  So ask a guy and you'll blow him away ;)|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i have yet to meet a girl that will ask me out|`|FsttwYe3aa	i usually make the first move i never meet a girl who asked me out|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I would like the guy to do so. Because if he doesn't like me, I will be upset. I am not good with bad news. lol.|`|a1xSsDryaa	i prefer the guy 2 make the first move!|`|vFldqvN4aa	I want him to do it first but i'll give hints i like him just to get him to  do it faster
VZVGXRyraa	It depends on the guy.<br>  <br>  Personally, once a relationship is over...that's it. I won't try to make anyone jealous. I won't even tell an ex that i'm going to another girl's house or am going out with another girl unless she asks me specifically. I have no reason to. No longer my girlfriend so she doesn't need to know my whereabouts. Any guy who purposely tells an ex something to get a rise out of them needs to grow up.|`|AIftgLEGaa	he is trying to make you jealous<br>  <br>  please answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq7eFllP1ekqSsrNyCNStXrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222135836AAdnTxq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	It means he is trying to make you jealous|`|dJoE8yedaa	He's trying to make you jealous. Hook up with him again, be as tantalising as ever, and make him wish. Every time he thinks of you after that, he'll get a hard one and you'll be number 1. Naughtiness is the way forward in this situation. Best of luck.|`|dyHKPlgZaa	it depends what kind of guy he is..if he's a player...its the truth...but if he talks to u a lot and tries to get ur attention and obsesses over u and stuff...then he's trying to make u jealous.<br>  :)|`|5f9hg9craa	-------------<br>  |VROOM  \<br>  |--o-----o-----]<br>  <br>  You yourself know the answer, and it is up to you to really find the answer. Don't let others answer's fool you.|`|2nsNvIanaa	id go 4 the jealous myself.|`|pqMb1jsKaa	Ok, you have 3 options for a guy:<br>  <br>  1) He thinks like a girl and actually wants to make you jealous..... OK, that's completely unikely, so let's rule that out and start again.<br>  <br>  1) He's going to sleep with someone else.<br>  <br>  2) He thought you were rubbish in bed and is just trying to get you off his back.  Hell, he might even tell you he's actually gay to achieve that - believe me, I've seen it done.<br>  <br>  3) (and this is the most likely one of all) He wants a threesome with you and this other girl that he quite fancies, and is prompting you to say, "Ooh, that sounds nice, can I play too?" Or something equally as contrived.<br>  <br>  Either way, you had a one-night stand.  What do you want, an engagement ring?  Get over it and move on.|`|pIWhfVWCaa	seems to me that this guy wants you to believe that he is a stud with the Lady's and wants to make you jealous and buy him saying he might go back to hers what he really saying is if you don't drop your knickers then im off get rid ov him you can do a lot better|`|AEfgQIhpaa	Make u jelous/he is going there.<br>  Y would he tell u if he didn't want you to be jelous?<br>  There is a possible chance he is really going, but he wanted you to be jelous. Hope your boy problems get better.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It could be either or. Guys like to get girls jealous its like a game to them so I would just play along and see if he ends up with this girl.|`|3U0q9AXxaa	depends<br>  was it just a quick hookup with no feelings involved?<br>  if yes then hes over you honey child<br>  if no then maybe he really is just going to her house<br>  but odds are theyll hookup|`|fcb1efacb648b3f1b1c0eff5cf18ba7daa	hes an ***|`|LTFH5zBEaa	ya he is trying to make you jealous|`|wzcJ9TO7aa	This sounds as if the guy thinks your're his friend like a good buddy even though you've hooked up.I don't think he's trying to make u jealous he might just have ur intentions miss understood.

VgiUGqxtaa	Loooool...<br>  <br>  when your wee wee starts bleeding|`|mefxIQP9aa	When your bleeding from your genital area. That's too much sex.<br>  <br>  When sex is making you miss work or fail classes. That's too much sex.|`|2YmzqL1baa	nope. have fun doing it. lol|`|o3d3NBVzaa	Sure. If there is physical damage or pain, that's usually an indication.<br>  <br>  You may become sex addicted too.|`|nVdYIHhzaa	well your cock can get raw if you have too much<br>  <br>  but in my opinion, unless you're married, any sex is too much sex.|`|bQmMNG5vaa	When you get sore or it bleeds is usually a good sign.|`|L69jZMXQaa	no not at all|`|IJXLWU0Zaa	(Safe)Sex is one of the healthiest things you can do. There's nothing wrong with having a healthy sexual apetite, infact there're many things right with it. As long as you're both consenting and into it there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.

MFPBz9dHaa	well depends what sort of girl she is ; buut personally if someoen said those things that you just wrote to me i wouldnt laugh. i think its so romantic when people express there true feelings. <br>  <br>  :^|`|NGDMRWqBaa	no. she will think its the cutest thing anyone has ever told her.|`|nETw4eOKaa	DO IT!<br>  My ex "loves" me to death.<br>  but he never really showed it.<br>  so i always doubted.<br>  so DO IT!|`|I8FVKLL3aa	It depends on how long you have been dating if it's only been a few weeks it might be to soon. But most girl don't mind being told that guys think they are special so I say go for it, you never know she may feel the same way.|`|NBi2SoJzaa	maybe, but if she does tell her ur serious, if she doesnt take u seruios then brake up
spWtg1Cmaa	Depends on how long you've been with her. When I first got together with my boyfriend I felt the same way. Now I am out of that puppy love stage and I can enjoy the time we spend apart. The obsession thing gets old so try not to depend on her for your happiness.|`|oAYCestzaa	your clinging onto her too tightly you have to find your own life go out with your guys what if you broke up??t hen you would be extremely devastated be independent!|`|W6LGsQC8aa	It is most definitely not healthy to need to rely on another person to be happy. It can lead to the other person feeling smothered or under a lot of pressure if they know they are the only thing that can make you happy.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to time manage, as I tend to have the same problem when I'm with someone I love... but buy some video games or hang out with other friends once in a while, your significant other will appreciate the alone time and it will make them want to see you even more.|`|fQf4FMbmaa	Yes you got it bad but this is not a bad thing simple and short you are probably in love don't worry about it though this is a good thing keep treating her right and she'll most likely stick around for a long time. Also just note that sometimes you and her will need space so occupy your time when you are not with her rather that be hanging out with platonic friends or any other hobbies you have. being away from each other will make you appreciate the time you are together. Good luck with that relationship. Peace
ybexjS2Paa	I'd ask her what the heck is she playing at. I understand she could have been drunk but if you can't control yourself don't drink! simple. Imagine if the guy weren't your friend just some strange guy, you would've never found out what happened. Are you sure you can trust her?|`|td6WXhv4aa	Did your 19 year old friend care about what he was doing with minors? *sigh* nobody seems to respect the line anymore.<br>   <br>  Oh and ditch your GF she's a skank|`|i1PXebLvaa	aaww, well im really sorry. But if you really like this girl and think you guys will only get better, than i would try to CALMLY talk to her as she could get pissed off real easy just for you knowing about that happening.-Hope that helps! :)) P.S: she would get pissed off because if my bf knew that then i would be completly pissed and embarassed that he knew and i couldnt imagine what he would be thinking of me especially calling me a low-class whore.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	That's fucked up. Talk to her about it. If you really want to stay with her make her stop getting drunk so you can make sure shes not cheating on you anymore. Honestly though i would just dump her. If shes not responsible enough to handle drinking and not cheating then she's obviously not that responsible. If she wasnt drunk then DEFINANTLY break it up.|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, first of all, being drunk is not an excuse for cheating. You dont need to tell her anything or try to talk it out. Just tell her that you know what she did at the party and that you have better things to do than to waste your time on a girl like her and then just leave her. You deserve better but no matter what, dont lower youself to her level. Just leave her.|`|6juV48RWaa	dump her dirty ***|`|asXHWTK6aa	Honestly, i would go 50/50 on this, your firend could be a liar, but then again, could be telling you the truth.  So you don't know. Friends are deceivers. Ask her what you guys did last night to see if it matches your friend's story, then ask your friend, make sure BOTH of them gives you DETAILED responses. In the end, go and investigate yourself. Ask other people that were in t he party. Maybe they will tell you the truth. <br>  <br>  If you really do care for her, then do what i suggested, if not break it off.<br>  <br>  If you want to be cruel and "revengeful" then tell her "Lets have a 3 some since you wanted to do it with my friend so badly" <br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|c28b58897fec8e58b0165a48d353dd02aa	Shes 15, getting drunk, having threesoms, and making out with girls?<br>  <br>  just think what she'll be like when shes 21!!!!  She did you wrong, but dont call her a whore, (youll attract them) you shouldn't be together. as for your friend, i think he didnt do wrong, if he noticed and left.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|JxmJg37Iaa	tell her how you feel and that you know, tell her you loved her and what she did realy hurt her, but before you act think what u might of done to make her act in that way, if shes mature she will realise what shes done and promise not to do it again after apologising, good luck.|`|nklXfvalaa	i would talk to her and ask her what happened and if she don't give you the truth then idk what to say|`|9xCtDDBgaa	I would dump her. You deserve someone classier.|`|eMXIQaQlaa	Break up with her then? She's obviously not right for you. Life's too short. Just tell her she's not who you thot she was.|`|uhQJwWGyaa	give them time both explain|`|8FbOtXAXaa	First of all maybe no one was replying to you because I could barely make out your words. A lot of misspellings and your words are all over the place. Anyways, this girl sounds like she is a wild one and for her to go out and get drunk and be doing things behind your back and having sex possibly or making out with guys she doesn't know is just wrong. You deserve better than that and I wouldn't even say anything to her. I would just cut it off with her because she doesn't sound like a very loyal and trustworthy person anyways. I'm sure you can find a girl that will treat you with respect and won't go out and act like a prostitute.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	Well.. you weren't there so you don't know for sure.  It's awful trusting of you to believe your pal completely.  It's important that you are calm before you talk to her, and then explain the story you got and ask her to openly and honestly tell you what actually happened.  <br>  <br>  What if it turns out that she was at home with her parents?  If she says she was out but that nothing happened, I would still be skeptical of her.<br>  <br>  Maybe time to ditch her and find some body better?|`|gOVGAtXtaa	dude, let her go. tell her you know what happened and that you dont want to waste anymore time with her. as for your frat friend he is a good friend for leaving and telling you about it. im pretty sure your girlfriend made out with the other girl when your friend left. theres more girls out there for you and your life is just starting. dont be dumb and get over it.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	Well sweetie, if you honestly feel that upset about this, then maybe it's time to give this relationship a break. Even if she was drunk it was no excuse. And it's even worse if she didn't even say anything to you...tell her outright and i mean seriously? She deserves to have you blow up in her face..|`|na0d9uRqaa	ouchh...if i were you id talk to her at school tomorrow and just be like i heard this happened.....did you mean it? if she really cares shell be devastated and if she doesn't shell probs just pretend it didnt happen. if she pretends it didnt happen and tries to blame it on you id say break it up, shes not worth your time<br>  hope this helps :)|`|x67HctK5aa	ask her directly and watch her face change its emotion if your friends lieing then shed get a little, not angry but more of mad, but if hes right then her face will turn red shell break up with you unless you talk to her so id hurry up|`|zNYxYFIEaa	she was drunk.<br>  id just tell her not to drink any more my friend tried to blow me when he was drunk i cant really blame for bei ng how wasted he was and he doesnt remember so she mite not even remember so id be somewhat nice about it|`|RVlkauBRaa	First of all, settle yourself down. If you yell at her youll loose her for sure! Just ask her, dont blow up. And thank you friend for not screwing your girlfriend :p|`|5g6xQcoTaa	You should dump her .<br>  Seriously ,<br>  She would still know what the hell she was doing even if she was drunk .<br>  You need someone who can control themselves ,|`|RbrOS2YZaa	dude be honest on what u saw and talk to her coz if u keep this up ull get more heart braked so tell her what u saw and if u belive her give her a second chance trust me.good luck bro :)|`|vLayvDt5aa	just ask her what was wrong with her.<br>  <br>  or she is probably just a lesbian!!<br>  <br>  of course i would leave her if i were a guy.|`|CAhunDFnaa	I would talk to her!<br>  Your friend was drunk it might have been a mistake.<br>  But still talk to her.<br>  (If i were you i would dump her, just sayin)|`|NBi2SoJzaa	brake up, what reason did she have to get drunk for?|`|rPvQQzp4aa	no one likes a **** and i think if your drunk or not it doesnt matter its not an excuse|`|Mr9McLtiaa	15! Yeah that's slutty.  Im sure u are really disappointed in her.  Im sorry this happened, ur only 16 and this is a bad experience for u b/c this will completely ruin ur trust in all women.  Not all women are dishonest like this so don't lose hope in us.  Tell her u no longer want to see her, if she asks why then u explain to her that her actions were a blatant disrespect against u and u will never stand for it.|`|X6ipvO1xaa	ok. you need to calm down. stop swearing. just talk to her. say something like, " ok, so i heard something about you, and i want to see if its true" just so she doesnt think you are believing everything you hear and are accusing her. then tell her what you heard, and she will either admit it or deny it. if she denies it, then you either have to believe her, or decide if you think she is lying or not(remember, your friend was really drunk so he could have just thought it was her but it was really someone else), but if she admits to it, let her explain the situation before you get mad. then you have to decide if her explanation is worth keeping her, or if you have to let her go. <br>  <br>  sorry about the situation. i know that cheating is a very difficult thing to go through. hope i helped.

You might even want to flirt with him for awhile first so that he will be expecting you to ask him out next time.|`|gywXHuGCaa	tell him ''if i was joking would i do this?'' and then kiss him... that'll do it...

fMEypXDYaa	Sounds like you two are working things out, the sad thing about all of this is that your grandmother is about ready to pass on, so just try to make her last days stress free and go ahead and have the baby, at least she will pass on knowing that your going to have a baby. If you and him can still love each other and are willing to work things out, then your ahead of the game, so just focus on one thing at a time and soon all of this will be in the past, and once you have your baby, you will have your grandmother's memory both in your heart and in the baby; who knows, it could be a girl and maybe  you can used part of your grandmothers name in the name. Good luck.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Worried about stress giving you a miscarriage?  Hmm... I've heard that before too...."My b/f or husband is messing up, so I'm going to fake a pregnancy for attention and then fake the miscarriage (which is just my period coming on).  Who knows, maybe if we make up I'll get pregnant for real!"<br>  <br>  OK.  So let's say you are actually pregnant.  And actually give birth.  I bet you end up a single mother because this fool will get tired of it before the kid is old enough to go to school.  Hopefully you only have one.  Don't count on child support either.|`|On7qQoVLaa	im really comfused about the question sounda like some one just rambling!!! have the baby. HAPPINESS IS A CHOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|GmTMVmASaa	in time you will have forgotten the sad times, and love will overcome the memories.|`|7cjqT33Baa	This sounds like an author testing out a bad concept for a book, it's just so much Jerry Springer drama.  It also sounds like you pulled the old trap him with a pregnancy.
HYjsxoNaaa	He obviously likes you. Some people (like me) have problems showing emotions.|`|SweWC8p1aa	He's really into you. He might just be a bit shy. In another 2 weeks, if he doesnt show more emotion, he may just not be for you.
LKsl00CTaa	In my opinion, the guy should ask the girl. But since it's out in the open, i guess it really doesn't matter. One thing I do think you should do is ask him yourself, not through a friend. It's more personal that way.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Why involve another person? Ask him out yourself,|`|sBGqBYJqaa	no that is so first grade

She may dress to impress you or spray perfume on or just do her hair totally different just to impress you.|`|NvgowkZzaa	If you catch her looking at you, with a smile, multiple times. If she touches you sometimes when you talk to her, as in she casually touches your shoulder or tries to give you a hug. Also if she asks you questions about yourself or about school. Tries to get to know you and have a conversation with you. Talks with you a lot. (There are some shy girls!) The shy girls will smile at you, or look at you. Sometimes that might try and talk to you and make conversation with you. Also they might ask you questions.|`|iwYPv2dyaa	she'll smile at you, in a group of people glance at you often, if you have each other's numbers she'll text you a lot, she'll touch your arm while you talk,  she'll fix her hair when she thinks you arent looking.  <br>  ps-I like the way your question is stated haha!

s7us9819aa	Love is blind means that when you are in love you are blinded by the feelings that you have for one another.  When your together you don't worry about the rest of the world.  You are blinded by love, so that you see things through rose colored glasses so to speak.
yIdwMPsoaa	Same thing happened with my used to be best friend. She tried to break us up a lot.<br>  I'd suggest you guys ignore her as MUCH as possible, and mostly your boyfriend. Once she will see that it doesn't affect you guys or it doesn't do anything, she'll stop. But when you SHOW her that it does something to your relationship, she probably finds it fun or she loves your guy. Maybe she is also jealous that you are dating him because she probably doesn't have the same kind of affection she used to have while you wern't dating him, maybe he pays more attention to you.<br>  <br>  Only thing you can do is ignore her, and you and your boyfriend shouldn't listen to her when she says stuff, act as if it didn't bother you guys at all.|`|vJGeOvQxaa	JUST TELL HER TO GO AWAY, AND IF SHE DOESN'T, JUST KISS YOUR BOYFRIEND IN FRONT OF HIS FRIEND OR SOMETHING.... HAHAH<br>  <br>  OR U CAN MAKE A PLAN WITH UR BOYFRIEND|`|72PLw9R0aa	Yeah. You should probably tell her to stop. You could always talk to your boyfriend about this. Does he notice? And if he does nothing you need to.|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	wow what a dumb *****. tell her to grow up and go find someone else, and that shes just embarassing herself.<br>  <br>  my friend's boyfriends ex would always keep talking to him, even after both she and her bf told her to go away. so she (who lives in another state) 411ed her and got her home phone and called her, and the girls mom picked up. she said "this is ____, can you tell ____ that i called?" and the girl got soo freaked out and never talked to the guy again. i dont think that would work here but its still a nice story x)<br>  <br>  maybe try talking to your bf a bit more about it. so you guys can kind of get an alliance going on so that she doesnt ruin your relationship.<br>  <br>  she probably likes him, but she sounds like an idiot so i wouldnt be intimidated.|`|lGIL36faaa	lol she's just a jealous prick..she is extremely jealous of u two 2gether!<br>  <br>  u know wat 2 do...wen u're with u're boyfrend and she's with u too,then do stuff that will make her even more jealous like hold his hand,kiss him(if u two have started 2 do that now) or just make him laugh at stuff,so she can see that he is having fun with u! and all this that i have told u r stuff like those mind games that people do! its wat u call revengeful plans! and just so u know i have been thru this,,,well not exactly the same situation,i mean it didn't involve a boyfrend,,,it was just me and my other frends who wer jealous of me and my best frend!

Your boyfriend needs to tell her that he doesn't want to be around her anymore. If he doesn't, she'll continue to think that she has a chance with him. And things may only escalate.<br>  <br>  If your man doesn't fix this, it may ruin things between the two of you. This is exactly what she wants.
130e0733e4248f7f06961dce1ec109c2aa	"Time to think about things between us" means, he's not ready for commitment, or he doesn't think it's working out. Play it cool, if he likes you, he'll be back soon enough. Don't push things, not everything is meant to be.

He got mad and was like "we weren't even going out."<br>  To make a long story short, i ended up apologizing and we went out for 2  weeks. It ended very badly. ....<br>  <br>  Anyway back to you. Forget about this guy, Obviously he doesn't care about you at all. And of course the first few days are going to be hard. Just get over it and move on. Don't contact or talk to him.

If you play more hard to get, that drives guys crazy, they like a challenge. Don't push things. Also,your friend should have kept her trap shut.  If you confide in friends, swear them to secrecy.

For as long as the two of you stay together neither of you will ever make each other truly happy, because whilst you are unhappy you can't make him happy. <br>  <br>  It will be the hardest decision you will ever make, and you will hurt, but you said yourself, you deserve better. It won't last no matter how hard you try to soldier on, so do you break his heart now or do you wait and prolong the heartbreak for yourself?<br>  <br>  Be strong and aim for what you want in a boyfriend, too many of us settle for second best.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|td6WXhv4aa	Just tell him your fired and move on.|`|6ErVPePEaa	This is one of the hardest things you will ever have to do... Try a trial separation....Take time to be by yourself. If you are thinking you are better off without him then it is pretty much time to end it. Could also be that you have gotten comfortable in your relationship and you are bored now. Try and spark up your relationship again. If after that you still feel like you want out, you will just have to end it. People always hate having to end relationships. You will have to go through the grief process of a failed relationship that is normal. People hate that thats why they stay in unhealthy relationships.... Just have to suck it up and move on|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	You just need to constantly remind yourself that you deserve better, plus its not fair to lead him on like that.

You both just need different things.|`|vkF5OVGCaa	Maybe she's just not sexually attracted to you or she could just be insecure about her body. You could try telling her you think her body is amazing and do some foreplay.|`|BeY1ujJpaa	i dont know, except the nude photos!!! most girls dont want nude photos floating around!!<br>  <br>  never known a girl not to like oral!! although i have known a couple of guys who wouldnt give it!!! dodgy|`|bit5P4Dwaa	ugh you need to respect her and not base your relationship on sex.<br>  when the time comes she will let you know but don't hassle her.|`|whR6j9JIaa	Just dump her azz and find a more fun girlfriend to be with.<br>  <br>  There, problem solved.|`|vkQOeDlUaa	welcome to the world of hormones|`|9mQC5Vihaa	I'd ignore that first post. She might have a few skeletons in her closet regarding her sexual past. <br>  Being physically compatible with someone is one of the most important things in a relationship. If one person isn't satisfied it's destined for failure. Might be time to look else where.<br>  <br>  Don't push to hard for the nude photos they're only good for getting revenge after a relationship (or a few good wanks) so I can see why she turned you down there.|`|GpUjqWgoaa	She just might not be as open as you are about anyone seeing her nude.  Does she have low self esteem?  This is a crucial point, so listen up;  If she doesn't have the same sexual drive as you do, no matter what you do, it'll NEVER change.  Her drive is her drive, that's it...nothing more, nothing less.  If you cannot be satisfied with her sexual drive, then move on to greener pastures!  You didn't give you ages, so I'm guessing she is fairly New to sex.  give her time, she needs to know if she does whatever you want, you won't dump her and call her a ****.  The "what gives" question you ask shows that YOU are in this for YOU.  Are you a controlling guy...it shows!  Sex is NOT about "I want this this way and she'd better go along with me"...caveman style.  Where is your style with romance?  That's what women want...they want romance.  You have to show her you love her and let her make her own decisions on what she does and doesn't want to do.  You can't force someone into being who they aren't.<br>  <br>  Take a Prozac and relax.  If you keep pushing her, you'll push her right out of bed into some other guy's arms!<br>  <br>  You make the call!|`|8G0PhjlPaa	maybe she just isn't into sex like many people are or she isn't completely ready for sex. just because she had sex already doesn't mean she was ready for it and wants it all the time. for example my friend was a virgin and had sex with her BF and she wasn't ready to she jsut did it cuz he kept egging her on and asking for it so finally she just did. so now she has sex with him whenever he asks because she just doesn't feel like hearing him ask for it repeatedly. its sounds stupid but that really is the story.<br>  <br>  maybe she is insecure about showing her body etc.it could be many things maybe you should talk to her about it and ask her why she is like that|`|X6ipvO1xaa	ok, if u really think that every girl u go out with is going to give it to u right away and all that then you've got some problems. no offense, its just that girls are sensitive. some are even modest (im guessing that ur girlfriend is one of the modest ones), so you need to care about her. make her feel special, and loved. and wait. she might just need more time. how long have you been going out? and just because you are good looking doesnt mean she would want to exchange nude photos. she could also be insecure. so try talking to her about it without expecting to do it after ur conversation. hope i helped.|`|d9xIDrySaa	Maybe you want more sexual stuff out of the relationship than she does.

S8H5yYcoaa	Right now, your hormones are spiking, giving you that 'out of control' feeling.  There are probably some holistic methods to get things calmed down a bit, and I know a lot of people who went on birth control to get their homrones in check (it's not just for if you're having sex - hormonal birth control stopped my sister's awful cramps, my best friend's severe acne, and my production of ovarian cysts, long before any of us were sexually active!), but really the long and short of it is that this will fade in time, and so you shouldn't worry too much.  Not everyone goes through what you're going through (hence the cliche that high school boys are so horny but high school girls are completely uninterested), but what you're describing, while certainly a pain for you to have to deal with, sounds well within the range of normal adolescent experience.  I masturbated like crazy at 17, too, and still have a high sexual drive now at 22 but much calmer than back then.<br>  <br>  You deserve congratulations for continuing to associate meaning to sexual intimacy at a time where your hormones are doing their darndest to convince you otherwise!  I know it's frustrating, but I'd really encourage you to stick to your guns on that one, since you express desire for you first time to be meaningful.  Sex, be it your first time or your hundredth, is so much better with someone you really care about, resepect and trust.  You will remember your first time, and if it's something you feel should be special it's really worth the wait.  Especially because, even though your body is telling you like crazy that you should be having sex, doesn't mean that doing so will actually curb these urges any more than your own two hands are doing... it took me years from when I started having sex to when I was comfortable enough with my body and my partner to actually get anything out of it, and when I was younger and more inexperienced my partners were, too, which led to little knowledge or ability (or sometimes even willingness) on their parts to please me much.  Meanwhile, in playing with yourself so much you're learning a lot about how you work and what you like... gathering so much knowledge and comfort now really increases your chances of having good sexual experiences once you do find a partner you feel you're ready to do it with.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!  It's rough, but I promise it'll calm some with time.|`|HNmKgYnUaa	Oh wow you sound just like my friend at school.<br>  <br>  She is crazy about sex and tells me and everyone about how she masturbates and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  She writes these yaoi stories and damn for someone who has never had sex she knows alot!<br>  <br>  I say you should def get a dildo[not romantic...lol] and just go on like that.|`|wol6ECnQaa	It's normal, but most women reach their peak at their 30's. You may have already "devirginized" yourself by masturbation, meaning you might have broken your hymen already.<br>  <br>  Throw in a silver bullet, a toy. If that wouldn't work, then try getting a friend with benefits. No strings attached but make sure you use protection. Better safe than sorry.|`|bit5P4Dwaa	some girls hormones can just go out of control sometimes.<br>  just be calm and they will settle down slowley but surley.|`|c28b58897fec8e58b0165a48d353dd02aa	I'm 16 and going thru the same thing......scince i was like 12.|`|MFlzqiU5aa	you should really think about having sex or get a dildo. i lost my virginity to my best friend. no strings attached. dooo ittt.

fMUsmAKPaa	if you have pleasant dreams about him it's probably because you like him ... if at 13 or 14 you feel "really alone whenever he's not with you or beside you" then you should make it a point to hangout with your girlfriends and family, you are way too young to think he is the center of your world ...concentrate on being the best person you can be ... use your time alone to always be doing something to better yourself,  ... go enjoy 8th grade, there will be many more Luke's throughout your lifetime Cookie!|`|zigiGUICaa	Huh...that's weird...<br>  Honestly, I DO think it means SOMETHING...becuase I have those same kind of dreams about somebody I like.  But mine ONLY involves making out.  Anyways, I haven't got the gut to ask him out...and ever since I had those dreams, it seems like the more I dream about it, or think about HIM, the more I notice "hey, he really DOES like me."  So, in conclusion, yes, it DOES mean something: HE DOES LIKE YOU! (and obviously, you like him) <br>  : - )|`|cwyZk7Fuaa	do u think u like him coz he likes u? or bkas u like who he is?... why do u flirt with him..coz its fun?.. if u dont imagine urself bein with him dont give him hope. xx|`|oE1eCjRtaa	well to be dreaming off him, it means your subconscious is telling you that you like him. Ask him out :)|`|Gsq05hXCaa	You like him. he likes you. need I say more. Now just make the move and the both of you will be happy.

I think that most places they take your desire into account at 16, and at 18, you are a legal adult and can whatever you please. Often times, though, it depends on your parents as well. If they are willing to let you stay with the other, if they have a criminal background, their quality of life, as well as any illness.|`|AA11923213	its different in some states but the average is 12|`|6ErVPePEaa	It is different in different states....|`|eaLn1nhUaa	You have to be 16 honey.

cFd00priaa	Your date went very well, have no doubts about that. However, it probably didn't help that you texted her the next day saying you would call the following day. It gives the impression that you have nothing else to do, which is not very attractive.<br>  <br>  Regardless, give it 3-4 days and send her a casual text message asking how things are going/if she's interested in hanging out again.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	She def seemed interested.  A lot of girls think that you shouldnt talk to a guy a couple days after the date.  Its a stupid little thing they have because they don't want to seem too needy or too clingy.  Maybe thats it, or perhaps she has been busy.  You can never really tell.  Give it a few more days and see what happens.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	it seems like a great date<br>  maybe she's waiting so she wont seem to clingy|`|CBSt5Tkhaa	maybe she is busy.<br>  call her maybe?

Do NOT dump him!! I was in your exact situation and now i really regret dumping him and can barely get over him. You are both going through puberty (my guess of your age) and especially boys go through their ups-and downs.

23Yt0evuaa	let me guess the 92 in your username puts you at 16. It's not a big deal not to have a boyfriend at that age.

IWO1GTpGaa	Honestly, your right it's time for you to give up on them both and move on.  Once you break up with someone and both of you decide to move on then it's time to move on.  If you want drama then stay with the guy who has a girlfriend.  Also, if you want to see a fight then stay with the guy your brother seems to dislike.  All in all you are in a lose lose situation.  Move on and stop worrying so much about dudes who have moved on.  Don't become the reason a guy will cheat and don't become just a sex toy to a guy who you thinks still likes you.  Go find another guy who like you mutually.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Good advice i was given once was 'toss a coin'. It always works. Good luck.<br>  I feel for you.|`|WOqHt0D7aa	move on period...you have spun your own web and now you are caught. not a good thing to become involved with your male friends if you plan on looking up to them or going to them when relationship problems happen later with different guys. they won't be there. getting involved changes the way two people look and feel for one another. talk to them and try keeping them only as friends. sounds like both guys are going threw a hard time with their own relationship aside from yours and are needing companionship and are looking for it with you. PLEASE DON'T GO THERE. PLEASE. DON'T.
cFd00priaa	Some people consider sex of more of a pleasure or activity, and generally these people are ok with three-ways. If you fall into this group, then consider talking with your boyfriend about it and possibly setting some ground rules.<br>  <br>  Others consider sex more of a spiritual experience. If you're one of these people, then you very likely do not like the idea of a three-way. Contrary to what popular culture may say, that's perfectly alright. Tell your boyfriend this. If you are one of these people, then I'm guessing your boyfriend and you may not be the best match.|`|VPMUuIxUaa	first of all, all guys would love to have a 3-way, 2nd of all if it does happen things will definately change between u two (or three) so there is alot of things to think about, and no one can answer that question but you two (or three),  GOOD LUCK! and have fun!!!|`|fex9lpeaaa	no thats the cost of growing up|`|2vftoAjBaa	Well....did he say he wanted it with another woman?|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Don't do this. I can tell your not comfortable nor ready for a threesome and it could ruin your relationship with him. Threesomes are best when your single and free.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Your "boyfriend" shouldn't want a three way with anyone. That one shows that he is lusting for someone else, and two a sign of disrespect towards you. If you go through with this your relationship will begin to deteriorate due to lack of limits and respect. :)
jcABVxmfaa	Try flirting more and more. This way he will realize that your interested. If he flirts back with you for a while, then you should tell him you like him again. But before you do this, give it time to play out, make sure he likes you first, by seeing how much he flirts back when you flirt with him! I hope things work out okay! Here are some other tips to see if he likes you!<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then h

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We 'can' develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|zfGJ3YD3aa	love - she loves you as a friend or member of the family or something and she really likes you.<br>  in love - she doesn't love you enough to want to grow old with you in a relationship type thing, there's no spark.<br>  if that makes sense.|`|obXAeNW5aa	Ok here goes the difference is love between friends or brother and sister mom and kid those are just i love you kinds.

If you are " in love " with someone, I think it means more than just love. It means you are fully loving them and you want to spend every day together. If you love someone, then that means you like them as more than just a normal friend. ( but not like girlfriend / boyfriend) I'm not sure if this is making much sense to you, it's hard to understand. <br>  If you are talking with a boy, you want them to be in love with you. <br>  If you are talking with a girl, then you want them to love you.

FAST!} but if your trying to get the guy just flash him a smile and go along with it say something funny like you dont care im usually just like "thankss i know" lol<br>  - dont act too stupid in front of them ive talked to guys about it and it gets annoying fast <br>  - if they ask for a hug or for you to sit on their lap or whatever dont immeadietley do it make them wait at least 5 seconds {longer for sitting on laps and only sit on the laps of guys you really like}<br>  - if they do something like stare at your boobs or slap your butt you have to at least pretend to be offended dont make a huge stink about it but just be like "heyy!" and smile at him<br>  - DONT trash other girls in front of him it doesnt make you look good<br>  - DONT try to get his attention my being like "OH MY GOD THAT GUY FROM BLAH IS SOOO HOT" it doesnot work. everr|`|bo3wG260aa	Just try to find out why he hates you and correct it.

Find another guy who will respect you who you are and not only get to you for sex.|`|eWUBXZMuaa	Clingy is not good.<br>  The best way to make a guy realize how much he misses you is not talking to him, start talking to other guys.<br>  Don't make it obvious that you're attempting to make him jealous, just do it kinda melancholy.. If he says hi, say hi back, but don't think much of it.<br>  Eventually he'll come running back to you and realize how much he missed you ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|TBd8B96Haa	well if you want to get him back just tell him you wont be jealous anymore and just dont be jealous of that girl cuz who is the one going out with him you or her? so yea dont be jealous and you might be able to get him back|`|KgOhhvTQaa	move on. sorry.|`|cFd00priaa	When you two were dating, he should have been able to spend time with other women in a friends-style setting without troubles. If you kept bugging him about it, it showed him that you didn't trust him.<br>  <br>  If you want him back, you need to play it cool. Talk with him. Be happy. If another woman comes over, include her in the conversation. Even better yet, if you walk past him talking with another woman, give a genuine smile and keep walking. Hang out with other guys. If he sees that you're ok with him spending time with other women and you're spending time with other guys, he'll be much more interested in getting back together with you.
2iXuzHgwaa	She may as well be just as shy as you are, but dont take it as if she doesn't want to be with you, she probably doesn't want to because she's scared. Its common.|`|XasLRQnXaa	don't ever ask her to hold hands or kiss! you have to be smooth about it...since you're going to the event tomorrow do something like this. "hey lets go over here" and just grab her hand and lead the way but dont let go unless she does. If she does let go, then its okay she just wants to go a little slower with this relationship. GL!
tDnD7Uqgaa	No-one can tell you if it's too soon. You are the only one who can answer that but maybe if your questioning it it could be too soon. My now husband said it with in a month but he and I really did love each other and we are still in love.|`|xM912JfXaa	no. Me and my boyfriend have been going out for a month and we said i love you on the first day|`|JJMa25NWaa	if you mean it, say it.|`|rbtO73eZaa	yeah|`|yeeFaIRFaa	no|`|QxCNx5Ogaa	yeah i don't think you can really tell if you love someone after 2 months me and my bf didn't say i love you after like a year in our relationship.|`|eWUBXZMuaa	Nope, if you really mean it than it's no big deal.<br>  I've been with my boyfriend for 1 week.<br>  I've liked him for a year, so it feels good to finally be able to say it ;)|`|wTbCA2l4aa	If you really mean it then i don't think that it is too early. just make sure that he means it too.|`|oRh9eP3Aaa	Yes I think you should wait to c if ur fee real|`|t5A14lUAaa	i know its cliche but if it feels right in your heart of course it doesnt matter!! Good on you girl!|`|V1i6c9qMaa	You are probably pretty young...so this may be just a young love. Enjoy it, you will learn in time what true love is!

hZltMpiPaa	Are you male or female? <br>  <br>  If you were male, I would say that she does like you.  Considering how Muslim women are expected to act around men (non-family) it seems that she would definitely be conscious of any signals she was sending you (like standing close, etc.)  And if a girl calls a guy for no reason, she definitely likes him.  I would consider discussing religion with her...if you were open-minded, let her know that etc.  And just to clarify, Muslim men are allowed to date/marry non-Muslims, just not the other way around.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're female, I would say the chances are that she just likes you as a friend.  girls will call each other for no reason and depend on each other a lot - just as friends.  Women often develop very close friendships that can resemble love.  Also keep in mind that in the Muslim/Arab culture, women have very special bonds with each other that have nothing to do with sex - for example, I and one of my female friends call each other habibi (my love) and say lots of stuff that could be misconstrued as romantic - but we're both totally straight.  <br>  <br>  Plus, chances are if you are close to her, you would know if she was a closet lesbian.<br>  <br>  So if you're a man, go for it....if you're a girl, don't.  :-/|`|VSXUa9lraa	She could like you, but if she's a person that's dead set on marrying someone from the same religion; she's being nice. <br>  For me; it's always nicer for a guy to ask straight on whether I like him or not, not try to make a move to see if I like him or not.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	I think you should tell her how you feel. Religion shouldn't hold you two back although if her religion forbids it and she is not comfortable with the idea then you need to respect that.|`|FcqDWdF1aa	You could convert your relgion.,That might work.|`|s9cT6yJIaa	By that, I can tell she is interested in u allot, and probably she likes you. But I do not know between a Muslim and a Christian...... and by the way, I've been friends with a Christian and I'm Asian Indian, we have a special relationship.|`|Gc3YEvnvaa	I think she really likes you, because i know myself i would never ever call a guy just to talk if i wouldnt like him. i think you should ask her on a date to a dinner or movies. most likely she is expecting that, but perhaps too shy to ask herself|`|yqFz7ig2aa	to marry her you have to make her convert to christianity, DO NOT convert to her religion. you really don't want to go down that path.|`|yqznQIZ8aa	" I know that Muslims aren't allowed to date or marry Christians.." <br>  no,  you know it wrong. muslims can date, marry, go out, etc with Christians or any other religions.|`|iHkflnChaa	Well just because she's a Muslim doesn't mean she will refuse to be with you. lol. Not everyone takes their religion seriously. But to me, it sounds like she likes you. Go for it. :)|`|28UJA6FQaa	dude, she's in love :)<3<br>  <br>  but honestly, just ask her how she feels, it'll save her the trouble ( because she might like you back ) & will save you LOT'S of trouble.|`|bwoVogaOaa	umm...<br>  tlk to her about it!<br>  sometimes things go the opposite way you want them to because you dont know FOR SURE what the right thing is or not.<br>  ??<br>  idk if that even makes sense?? <br>  :)|`|XeSRh52Waa	personally it sounds like a flirty friend and nothing more to me.<br>  but i would never be able to tell unless i was around you and this girl.<br>  best thing for you to do is ask her very bluntly "do you have any romantic interest in me?"<br>  if she does, she won't hesitate to say yes!<br>  but if she starts with "well, sorta, i guess, OR maybe" then don't try to make her because she really doesn't.|`|6OIK5RsQaa	I don't think it will be wrong..<br>  i have no problems in dating a guy with another religion..|`|nZpSM7ngaa	well,  im muslim, and i know you can marry/date her if you convert or promise to.
3IVqoH16aa	Rejection always feels bad.  So you really can't avoid that.  Just don't add to it by being mean or abusive and you'll be fine.  It's meaner to lead someone on than to just tell them you're not interested.<br>  The most subtle way to say no is to simply not make time for the person.  Everytime they ask you out just say you're doing homework that night or you have to take someone to the airport etc.  Most people take the hint and go away after two or three of these kinds of responses.<br>  There's a small percentage that don't take hints and you have to be more direct.  In this case, start saying things like, I'm watching Seinfeld reruns that night or I have to rearange my sock drawer.  This really presses the point that you'd rather be doing just about anything else than going out with them.  Anyone with a couple of shreds of self esteem won't keep pursuing in this case.  And if that doesn't work you have to move on to "Sorry, I just don't like you."  But there's a whole bunch of levels before you get there.<br>  And, speaking from a guys standpoint, DON'T say "we can just be friends" in an attempt to soften the blow, unless you really mean it.  Just say goodbye and be done with it.  It's much more clear and saves confusion in the future.|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	its hard but just say it.|`|ySvWezDdaa	"My bf and I have a pact that we don't dance with other random guys/girls, no offense but he's not around and I don't want to betray his trust"<br>  <br>  "Sorry but I'm a bit tired, think I'll sit this one out"<br>  <br>  "Sorry but I'm here keeping a friend company and don't want to just leave her alone here" (if you're in a club, etc)<br>  <br>  "I was dancing for a long time a while ago, I just want to relax for now, sorry"<br>  <br>  "My friend's getting over a bad breakup and we made a pact that this night would be an exclusive girls' night out, so sorry but I have to be there for her right now..."
AA11150213	This one is a player, you said it yourself and I can pick up on it. Don't waste your time thinking about him girl, your the only one who will be hurt in the long run, not him. The best thing you can do for yourself is look elsewhere, because you deserve someone who wont disrespect you.

WekPVVfVaa	so whats the problem....?<br>  You said that you like her, you said that you are going to ask her, you know shes most likely going to say yes, so wheres the problem? Ask her out!|`|h3Nw5JLmaa	You should ask her out if you like her.
0297b913d93d60ad18f3e83648c612fcaa	get her a nice piece of jewelry from some smalls shop somewhere...  if you're visiting a lot of places, get postcards from each place and when you get back put them together in a "scrapbook" of sorts (make one for yourself!)<br>  <br>  On each page, write a neat fact about it and about what you would have done if she had been with you....<br>  for example, on a page with a postcard from France, you could write<br>  "The top of the eiffel tower was voted the most romantic spot to kiss.  If you were here, we'd take the elevator up to the top towards dusk so we could see the skyline of Paris at Sunset...."  <br>  <br>  (I don't know if the Eiffel Tower was voted best spot to kiss, I just made it up for examples sake!)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|FxIZUUY5aa	well, id say it would depend where in europe youre going<br>  you could always get her a tshirt that says the country or city that youre going to.<br>  you could get her a necklace or something with a charm on it that is a big thing in the country youre going to. like if youre going to the netherlands, then id say something with a windmill or tulip or wooden shoe. get something that the countrys known for.|`|VgiUGqxtaa	You should really be elaborating what aprt of Europe you're going to.<br>  <br>  Europe isn't a country.<br>  <br>  Anyways, if you're going to the U.k, maybe London, then tiffanys/harrods. etc
XLoCsZXUaa	The first step you have to make to get out of her friend zone, is that you need to stop making her a priority, and in fact you should break all contact with her for a little while. You need to make her miss you, and the truth is, she can't miss you if you are always there.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	Have you tried the direct method, OMG talking to her|`|A15bfvkBaa	Tell her how you honestly feel.. open up with her..|`|OvKNUhbwaa	Man i know what your going through, my ex and i broke up last weekend and im dying right now...but what you need to do..1. figure out why the relationship didn't work. 2 find out if she is getting serious with someone else. 3 be honest with yourself and her cause if she takes you back then you can mess up or the  friendship you had with her will be gone for good. 4 the best thing to do is talk to her face to face and tell her how much you want thing to work and your willing to take things slow...but don't sound like your begging cause it might turn her off... Good luck

QM2UqZmuaa	Your question has 1 primary flaw in it. It assumes something. It assumes that there is no option of not talking to her.<br>  <br>  Shouldn't it depend on what the situation is? For example, such as what you were previously talking about?<br>  <br>  Or should there be this line you should memorize in a robotic way to recite every time you touch?|`|AjPbtm7oaa	You shouldn't be talking, stupid.

AA11899313	Playing, by the sounds of it.<br>  <br>  It seems that it's the behaviour of most kids.  it's just a part of the 'growing up thing' ~ a testing of the ''Superiority Testosterone Muscles'' over that of the female of the species.  Girls do it too ~ only they batter their eye lids, play with their hair, gaze into eyes, parade, dress up, leave buttons undone, skirts too short, make googoo eyes etc etc.<br>  <br>  Sorry, you just have to look upon it as a simply 'lesson in life' .....and maybe he'll learn that ''there is one less person in the world who trusts him now''.<br>  <br>  Sash.
cFd00priaa	Next time you're talking casually with her one-on-one in person, ask her if she wants to do something. If she has spent that much time talking with you, she's at least interested if not really in to you.
LKsl00CTaa	Kill yourself.|`|BaZBWq5Eaa	ok...awkward!!!!!!!!|`|GEqyvwXAaa	congrats on be okay with who you are! now because you're young, and i'm assuming she is too, don't come on too strong with the feet thing. it's unusual enough that it would probably freak her out. give her a foot massage, kiss her toes, keep it on the lighter side. store the memories for your alone tme. if she lets you keep doing it, you can either slowly build up what you're doing with her feet, or ask her to let you do things. if she likes you enough, and they're not going to hurt, she might say yes. just tread lightly (no pun intended): foot fetishism, while not uncommon, is looked down on by a lot of people. be sensitive to her, or all your friends might find out. if you're not ready for that to happen, look for a partner your friends don't know so well.|`|9vjxfIkYaa	Theres nothing wrong with that, im 22 and i love women sexy toes. i wont even date a girl unless she takes care of her feet. im not ashamed i tell them straight up  and give them money to get pedicures. ive watched whole 2 hour movies with my girls toes in my mouth. dont be shy most girls think its cute. most will even let you do dirty things to them, ill tell you when your older.|`|EhPRMuziaa	You have a foot fetish and it's creepy.<br>  Seek professional help.|`|VgiUGqxtaa	SEEK HELP....<br>  <br>  FIND HELP.....<br>  <br>  INDULGE HELP..........|`|5LIMuU69aa	Um, I don't know of any way of telling someone you wanna worship them, without them probably being freaked out about it.<br>  <br>  There's a good chance she'll take that you like her feet as a nice complement, as long as you don't act too weird about it.
TthDWtPTaa	so why do all that $hit for her then?
VzzQP2PJaa	Tell him how it made you feel and talk it out. A relationship without communication isn't a relationship, and if you feel you need to question further, then  you pretty much know where the relationship is heading. I don't think its as bad you think though. Hope this helped.|`|mefxIQP9aa	He's probably the type of guy that keeps his ex's close just in case something happened.<br>  <br>  Dudes are retarded...but then chicks do the same thing too.<br>  <br>  I still don't understand why she didn't go when you changed your mind about it. That's retarded.|`|9EkFrApiaa	Oh hello no!  You are his GIRLFRIEND...I would be so pissed.  GO and hold your head up high and don't let him pull anything on you with his exes.|`|59xQlCjGaa	You should be mad. I mean, his ex must be a jerk!

I don't really think it's that big of a deal since you two have been together for 3 years.|`|jvWAiGSwaa	Okay so he invited his ex to the funeral: I think that's fine.<br>  He then asked her if she needed a ride: I think all girls get jealous, but if HE asked HER if she needed a ride.

Were you cheated on in the past?<br>  That might lead to insecurities.<br>  I have some big time insecurities with my present boyfriend.<br>  I feel weird when he talks about girls or hanging out with them.<br>  If it continues this and you really feel upset about it, then talk to him.<br>  Tell him how you feel. I'm sure he'll appreciate the honesty.<br>  Plus, a relationship needs communication.<br>  I wouldn't be overly worried about it though. Just relax hun!<br>  :)|`|nVdYIHhzaa	if she didn't have any other ride it's fine and i could see my ex not wanting to ride in the car to a funer with my current girlfriend. i don't think you should be too mad just don't let your guard down|`|3i427B3raa	to make you not look jealous you have to yell at your boyufriend for thinking that you would be mad if another grl came along. make him feel bad for tyhinking so bad of you : )|`|ecwjjzFVaa	it might be right because he's not sure how he's feeling. and maybe his ex girlfriend had a good relationship with your boyfriend's step dad. <br>  you can always ask these things. :)|`|hwKFm7H8aa	wtf? how dare you ******* talk  bout any one of a funeral...I am sick of girls like you...its his step fathers funeral..he is not going to be trying to bang girls... show some respect!|`|7i9zha6Oaa	maybe his ex didnt like you very much|`|9ad188f0da0ee8a93abed4eb7b2bf545aa	.....|`|jaBjb6Nsaa	Well she probaly woulkdn't have been comfortable going to a family thing with his entire family either. I mean ex or not if you are going somewhere were you only know like one person, you kind of want to be with the one person till you feel comfortable. So he probaly offered her a ride so she wouldn't have to go and feel awkward because she didn't know anymore. I mean if you were going would you want to go with him, or alone?|`|wLwKMUIfaa	I think if you've been with him for three years and haven't met his family and were unsure if you wanted to attend his step dad's funeral, that might be a bigger problem than whether or not he's friends with his ex. He probably wanted someone to lean on emotionally at the funeral and since you weren't sure what you wanted, he asked her. I understand why you are upset, but maybe you both need to sit down and figure out what you want out of your relationship.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|025Vpc1kaa	I agree but you should yell at him, you should just say "why do you think i would mind if you invited one of your exes to the funeral?" You don't want it to seem like you think its ok for him to hang out with his exes but just ask him why he thought you would mind if you brought her to the funeral and why he did in the first place|`|QCAJeDxzaa	Maybe he didn't want to be alone; he just needed some support.  He wanted someone to talk to.  You've been together for 3 years, so if anything was going on, you would know by know.  I'm just curious why he's keeping in contact with his ex's. Hmmm - I'd have to ask him about that.|`|zHJCrlBYaa	there's nothing wrong with that. it's just a ride. these kind of relationships are rare with ex girlfriends.

His ex was probably close with him and his step-father. Maybe the nature of your attitude is what made this girl not want to come.

o3d3NBVzaa	You are having performance anxiety, most likely. Somewhere in your head, you may fear you may not be any good, especially since she has past experience. I'm guessing you are fearful you won't live up to expectations.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't take any medication or anything like that, as you may develop a dependency on it to get 'it' up for sex.<br>  <br>  I'd just talk to her about it, and how you are nervous, and try to put yourself at ease before doing it.|`|klcqgST9aa	Just practice getting hard yourself.

QODJNf1oaa	Well, I think it's normal for all girls to want a chase. Someone who isn't giving us their full attention makes us want to work harder, however, at some point in time we have to make the decision to choose, not the guy we want, but the guy we need. Guy #1 didn't respect you, didn't appreciate you & it took you straying for him to finally see what he lost. Guy #2 already sees & knows what he has, he doesn't need you to leave to know what he's missing and that is something that most girls would DIE to have. You better hold on to this man because guys like that don't come around very often. The other guy may miss you now, but how long will it take before he gets bored & starts treating you bad again?|`|59xQlCjGaa	...Looks like you have a problem... a big one....<br>  <br>  You should take guy 2. He's nice, and all you could hope for. Guy 1 neglects you and seems like he's cheating on you. Guy 2 is, like you said, perfect.<br>  <br>  Guy 2, all the way.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope things work out for you!<br>  ~Roses~|`|1zfwLsQpaa	The one which is willing to go to counseling. That is a huge sacrifice|`|AA10706358	your explanation was ok, I got the whole thing<br>  Look, as guy I will tell you this<br>  guy1 was feeling all tied up and somehow smothered regardless of whether he liked you or not.. but now after he is all in the "mood" again for you he wants you back, perhaps he is sorry, but there is a good chance he may pull something like that again, or at least won't treat you like you deserve to be treated..<br>  If you are sure about guy2 then go for it..<br>  If you can be certain guy1 is really sorry (don't think like you used to with him try to be less emotional, he WAS your ex, so that can cloud your mind) then perhaps he deserves another chance<br>  Good Luck, remember no one is perfect.. it's just what negative traits are you willing to accept !!|`|bAnyRNZUaa	This isn't really advice but a prediction:  you will go will go with guy #1 b/c he is more of a challange, he stirs up stronger feelings (even if alot are negative), and you want to believe he can change...can he?  Maybe but not likely.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a girl, but I would go with the good guy, who has been nothing but good to me, who hasn't chosen others over me.  Btw, what do you mean "i did some things he didn't know about?"|`|vp4xjqbLaa	They say better the devil you know!! but that isn't always true.<br>  You know how guy 1 treated you and he sounds immature and controlling also insensitive..immature people dont become mature with counselling!<br>  Start fresh with guy 2 he sounds nice and feelings will become stronger if he is what you are looking for.<br>  Ask yourself which one RESPECTS you more and which one makes you feel GOOD about YOURSELF.<br>  It looks like guy number 2 so think about starting a new fresh relationship and making it clear who you are and what you are looking for in a man so you dont get treated wrongly again.<br>  First sign of any mistreat stand up for yourself and move on if necessary.|`|PUgS2zVbaa	im not going to say either,but you should at least try to give your ex another chance. after him ask him if its ok if u can see guy number 2 for a little while and try to get to know him better. but if he doesn't want to see u again then don't beg but find a way to cheer him up.<br>  <br>  =)|`|ERWiypdYaa	there is a reason that he is your ex  and you have to keep that in mind ex should not be given another chance.|`|XPHdUpDKaa	turtwig|`|22355f171db4a29b75bab72bf2f8ad7eaa	Guy 1 must of had a pretty *first two words of my name*|`|pBu4ZGyTaa	Follow your heart. No one should tell you who to be with...<br>  <br>  :-)|`|7i9zha6Oaa	nicer prettier one... idk i didnt take time to read your essay|`|EhD32t2Kaa	Well, first of all, Guy 1 is abusive and may be like that throughout your relationship whether you go to counseling or not. So you should always be aware of that. As for Guy 2, you may not feel any strong feelings right now, but I'm sure if you go out for a few more months, you will like him more. Just remember, there are more guys out there then Guys 1 & 2, so if you really don't like either of them, you could try finding another guy who you really like. I hope this helps with your situation!|`|jaBjb6Nsaa	Well i mean you let things with man one play out, and as much as you love him and want him to change, he most likely wont. I've tried redating before and the same thing always happens. I would let things play out with number two and if later i feel like feelings aren't going to get strong enough then i would see if number one is still worth another chance.|`|FyL5OfmCaa	guy 1 of course|`|Om2PgqiVaa	I would say number two. You probably just have more feelings for number one because he led you on, and everyone loves a chase [at first].  And if you happen to find out you don't like number two than just explain to him. I think number one seems a little immature.  But I hope you get the right one. I know it sounds cheesy, but listen to what you heart says.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|yy7SKayBaa	Neither: Guy one let you down more than once, it wasn't healthy and I doubt he's going to change. Sure, he's got good points but I think the bad ones out number them<br>  <br>  I don't think it it fair to be with guy 2 either becauce hes obviously more into you than you are into him, its not fair to stick with him and just hope eventually, with time you'll love him back. I say you should stay away from men until youve recovered.
g7eIVqE0aa	You're trying sooo hard and you're not giving up but girl come on, do u really think u deserve being treated like that? If that relationship was suppose to work it would've worked...but it's not working. He can't be a man and make up his fuc*ing mind. Don't think about it that much. Just don't do nothing about it. Nothing at all. If he really cares about u he'll let u know. Now he's just letting u know that he's a jerk and that he doesn't deserve u. <br>  So my advice is to just let it go, do nothing about it. U made ur point when u sent him that text. You're a strong, smart girl! Don't let him take over your life.<br>  <br>  xoxo :):)|`|C4N3TM3maa	i think you should move on if he really wants to be with you he needs to stop playing games...
TthDWtPTaa	yes he should
RnmYc0lhaa	Sounds like he's gay.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Holy smokes he is a rather selfish and boring person in my opinion and it sounds like your the one doing all the work honey. I suggest you stop giving him BJ's altogether until he changes his views on pleasing you. And if he doesn't its time to move on. In my opinion he's lucky you didn't dump him already.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Move onto a guy that wants you to feel good. This guy sounds like a puss.

She should take a test first and if she finds out she isn't pregnant then this guy never needs to know. It would save a hell of a lot of trouble.<br>  <br>  Although if she is pregnant then she needs to tell the guy, whether she has made the decision if she's going to keep the child or not. He has a right to know and even fight for what he wants. But ultimately I think that it is up to her what she does.<br>  <br>  I think if your friend ever found out that you hadn't told him about this that he would understand since she's your sister.|`|7XIa76Usaa	she made the choice so let her tell him. Just do your best to have her on the pill and stay on it. Having sex is extremely pleasing and very exciting but do it safely. When a girl knows she is safe she can enjoy herself much more and have powerful orgasm's. condoms break|`|JxowGsKYaa	dont tell him...let her... she will know what to say..good luck!
TthDWtPTaa	scrub is not good, he's playing you
Wy0lUjP9aa	Well women don't like slobs by the way. Being a female has it's pros and cons, and I am pretty sure it does being a male. Females, pay pills and have money. But if we aren't conservative we get bad reputations, but if a man does it, it is ok. <br>  <br>  Unless you were both male and female you really can't say anything. Just like I don't say being a female is better than being a male, because I wouldn't know.|`|AA11324847	Whoa WTF are you smoking? If it's that easy, I'm gonna kill you and take your identity.

TthDWtPTaa	forget him
DNwHGeEtaa	First of all, you have to talk to him about where the relationship is at. Are you two dating exclusively? Does he call you his girlfriend? If your answer is yes to these questions, then what he's doing right now is considered cheating. You need to get a clear answer from him. Guys will always try to avoid discussing about this issue, but don't let him get away with this. Keep bringing up the topic until you get the answer. If you two are boyfriend and girlfriend, he's cheating on you. <br>  <br>  Now my advice is that don't trust this guy. First, he said he won't talk to other girls again, but he didn't keep his promise. Then he said he would delete his page, but he didn't keep his promise. Does it matter that he's just checking other girls' pages and not messaging them? Why would he check girls' dating pages if he didn't want to contact them? The answer is it doesn't matter, if someone has a dating page it means he wants to find a date. It's that simple. People don't go on match.com just to hang out. It's not facebook. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard to break up with someone you love, but just keep this mind, how long is he gonna keep doing this? My answer would be forever. And can you deal with this forever? You want to be with someone you love because it makes you happy. But now you're not even happy anymore, so why keep being with him?|`|ncvoaDIFaa	I know it is hard to hear.. but it doesn't sound like he is the one for you if he keeps doing the same thing over and over. He probably feels like he is in control if he can keep doing this and he still has you. He's just going to keep talking to them because he knows he will never lose him. If I were you I would break it off with him for a while, so you show him that your not messing around. And if after a while if he really loves you then you can get back together.|`|RUD2N3Sqaa	he might be but its so hard to say he is.......go talk to him n if he keeps being like this try to find out his password for his homepage and try to find out if he is writting to them and stuf and try to talk to the girls that he sees online and ask them how much do they talk to him and about wat they talk bout goodluck|`|J6grdba3aa	i doesn't sound like he really loves you. i've been through the same thing. its hard to say whether or not he's cheating but i think that the chances are high. i suggest you give him one more chance and if he still fails to break it off. or you could go on a break right now. you deserve someone who only wants to look at you just remember that|`|9m8bUb7Oaa	He might be writing thos sexual comments because, he mght want to have sex and he might know your not ready and don't want to?? I don't think hes cheating though??But, thats my opinion?? I think you should talk about it with him and to tell you what is really on his mind and why hes doing it??? Tell him you don't feel confturable iin a realationship where hes doing that and where theres not trust??!!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!=]|`|mefxIQP9aa	He'll probably end up cheating on you because you obviously have no backbone.<br>  <br>  All it takes for him is to say sorry and that's good enough for you.<br>  <br>  He has NO RESPECT for you. NONE. ZIP. ZERO. If he did, he wouldn't be doing this.<br>  <br>  Kick him to the curb. He'll just give you gray hairs.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Having sexual conversations with other women is, to me, cheating.  The fact that he hid it from you proves it.<br>  <br>  He's never going to be able to gain your trust back, and you're always going to wonder who he's talking to, if he still has a page (should he ever delete it -- the fact that he won't probably means he found somebody he wants to continue chatting with), if he has or will cheat.<br>  <br>  I think you should end the relationship.  Four months in, and he's already looking for girls?  It's been over, at least in his opinion.
ZOKS33uzaa	Life's little relationships aren't an every day thing i think you should ask her out,I know this couple that's married now and 30 and 29 and they started dating in the 8th grade.

But what helped me was to keep in mind that the worst a guy could say to you is no and you'll never know until you try. So just try to loosing up girl and not worry about what others think of you. Im not saying for you to go out there and be all crazy and attention hungry Im just saying take chances because if you dont you will miss out on a lot of good things in life and I know from experience.

angW1Lkfaa	This one is confusing, she may or may not have a boyfriend, I would guess not what bf would let her see some one else ? Unless they are setting you up. she could be keeping you at bay while she checks you out. When it comes to females some are hard to read. You may want to play it out but watch for red flags.

Some, not all, guys act on this (as in getting laid or masturbatin*), but there are still guys that do not do this.  the this is, guys were created as visual beings, that is we are stimulated visually and when we see something we like we complete the picture.  the few that do resist are the real men the can actually see how selfish it is to do that and how degrading it is to do.  i am proud of all real men that resist until marriage, are faithful and can see the consequences of their actions beforehand.  sadly, i am not one of them... i was for the longest time then i lost it this year and now i see myself as an a**hole and i despise my self.  i do not know if i will ever forgive myself.  i am sorry for whatever happened to you ( sounds like your boyfriend cheated on you and did not have a good relationship with you when you were dating), but please also remember that whoever it and whatever they did they deserve at least to be forgiven.  Now, you do not have to like them just forgive them, it is a very kind and good thing for you to do, for both of you.|`|crbzVL0Haa	You're being dumb.<br>  <br>  First of all, Twilight was a terrible book. Edward isn't real, so move on.<br>  <br>  Second, not all guys are like that. THEY MAY PRETEND TO BE LIKE THAT TO GAIN STATUS, but that's purely high school, which is OBVIOUSLY where you are. <br>  <br>  So get out of here and grow up.|`|VZVGXRyraa	Nothing you said is remotely true. Some guys are like that, yes...but not all guys. You're obviously attracted to the wrong ones if you have that train of thought. You'll never find a guy to settle down with if you continue to think we're all creeps. And lusting after someone in a stupid book isn't going to help you either.<br>  <br>  Guys are all different. Just like not all girls are drama filled, jealous, manipulative, slutty nutcases. No two people are the same, or act the same way. You need to open your mind to guys because right now you're just screwing yourself into the ground and you'll be the old lady in the corner house with a bunch of cats that all the kids in the neighborhood are afraid of.
u8eHTkWDaa	Hell yeah, the darker the hair and the brighter the eyes the more the woman will stand out|`|cVY7xjg2aa	impossible to tell..<br>  it depends..there are lots of girls with brown hair and blue eyes..but they don't look the same..some are attractive and others aren't..<br>  but it`s not the best color combination to me...|`|IFXAlv7Uaa	Josh C, the guy who said that sounded cute, is probably gay, so I wouldn't take his word for it.|`|IGQw4267aa	it depends if they have a cute face or not. the color of hair and eyes don't make someone hot or not.<br>  <br>  mine por favor?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlygtJNO_oSzP7P8aG0DuE3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222102706AAXFucX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ay2ksWhsaa	yeah, i find that an attractive combination|`|Gza8jaboaa	desperate much?!|`|ZS8M5OaTaa	you dont see many around, like how i would be attracted to a dinosaur if i saw one...|`|rmwVzVgqaa	LOL.....ARE YOU SERIOUS!

Brown hair, blue eyed women can be very attractive,... My husband has traveled extensively and he has found women of all eye and hair color attractive. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  But a women with dark hair and blue eyes can be strikingly beautiful.|`|d46f610a60316733e6c17cc867554da4aa	I think eye-color is an aspect of attractiveness, but the way the eyes are set (or shaped) is probably a bigger factor. To answer your question, I would say it depends on the girl.|`|O9rdrWKSaa	ya i do, because its actually pretty uncommon, and i think brunettes are really hot, and blue eyes are really hot.  so ya|`|DAH48qSOaa	yeah, but they may look cute with that, but prob on the inside they look like a red head with red eyes (high) LOl|`|yGfmofHUaa	if their face is pretty and they aren't fat hair color and eye color don't change a whole lot|`|sc0tta8zaa	Sure. It's pretty|`|ltIudMNUaa	It's what's on the inside that counts anyway right ;)|`|ZhsquaqHaa	sure i guess|`|bKBnHqkMaa	sure|`|lEwQg5fAaa	yes
BgOrztpPaa	Guys at 13 have a hard time saying pretty or beautiful ( I don't know why) So they use and alternative, which they beleieve sounds 'cooler'. But in normal terms, he would be saying that he thinks you are very pretty. Don't get caught up on every word he says cause remember your only 13. The relationship won't last forever. But have fun with it.<br>  TaTa, <br>  <br>     Abz|`|FmvnC8keaa	He means your attractive/pretty.|`|AA12074512	that your a ugly troll. sorry.|`|KkRb3paPaa	he thinks your pretty|`|XU1fftrMaa	He meant that your really hot.

8052a63d386f57a5453412aecd1de123aa	Ok, I'd written this huge speech BUT  since you said your father was emotionally abusing you, AND that he'd come over to ya'll's place,  actually,  HE was trespassing and if you are age of consent, ie 18,  he has nothing to do with you by law. So what you both should have done was 1: call the police because of his trespassing and no invitation 2:  your fiance' should have kept his temper and let your father put his hands on your fiance' then he could have pressed charges of assault  3:  now your father has put you both in a gray area of the law.  ie:  here say.  But since you're actually not your fiance's wife, you can testify to what had been happening at home, and what took place.  4:  your father can disown you however if any grandchildren come into play, he'll be disowned as well.  Sticky situation.  As far as my pers. op,  your father is reeling because he's now met his match in your fiance' who's probably more hot tempered than your father ever thought about being.  Your dad's the one who needs the heavy-duty therapy,  your fiance' needs anger management because if he's that easy to provoke, God help him and you if children do come into play.  Please go get everybody help before your marriage.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Sounds like dad doesn't like your fiance and wants him out of the picture. Not the best way to go about it. <br>  <br>  When my dad pulled that stuff on me, it only pushed me closer to the guy. Unfortunately, my dad was right about him, and I had to figure it out the hard way. However, to this day my dad wishes he had handled it differently so that I wouldn't have had to go through all I did.<br>  <br>  Right or wrong your dad feels he is doing what is best for you. It's still a difficult position for you to be in. I hope all is well for you soon.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Your father has very serious jealousy issues and was deliberately picking a fight, he is trying to break you up so the solution is simple: Do NOT go over there and keep them apart and if you're smart you'll live as far away as you can get.|`|gocQ9ND5aa	to answer your question no I do not find it absurd at all. If someone pushes me at all They are going to jail|`|6PbyKpHzaa	yeah|`|goCkjhDzaa	no. that's assault either way u look at it|`|FFrSdS2Daa	Don't worry.<br>  Your dad wasn't completely innocent himself  so if he presses charges then so can Jhon.<br>  After all, you dad did trespass into Jhons house AND into his room.<br>  your dad emotionally confusing you again<br>  Your dad came into contact with you after being told that he shouldn't see you because of his abusivness<br>  Jhon simply USHERD your dad out of his room. <br>  Your dad was in the wrong anyway so Jhon will be okay. After all, it is his house and your dad did turn up univited.|`|tWvM6M0raa	it depends on why your dad was getting in his face<br>  and if your fiance pushed him lightly or hard<br>  it could be seen as self defense if your dad was in his face|`|M0vQFHg9aa	What sort of idiot  wast the polices time over something a puny as that. If  your dad was getting up in your fiance face, your fiance has every right to push him back a bit.|`|EeabLB5eaa	Yes, the police will too. He won't go to jail he'll pay a small find it's  okay you and your fiance will get married and leave your dad behind.|`|AA10500537	stay with your guy but dont shut your dad out of your life completely , i;m sure your dad will thkn this over and drop charges ,<br>  yoou should call him and talk to him about it|`|ee3N1lpQaa	no your fiance has no respect iall <br>  edepends on how the siutatiion was|`|b1yUz50Qaa	this is absurd and they are gonna have to get along or you have to make a choice that no girl should have to make!|`|GE68lOBEaa	Nothing will come of it as your dad was not physically hurt. Even though i don't agree with your fiance pushing your dad, i can see that he was just trying to protect you.  I think it's best you keep your distance from your dad, he has hurt you enough and you don't and shouldn't feel guilty about anything.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your fiance lots of luck and hope you can move on. I personally think your dad is overreacting and the police will just tell him to go home.|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	Yeah, I do. Your dad is being a sissy.
dyHKPlgZaa	bless. ive been through that. if there's something you dont feel is right in your life like your all alone then it's up to YOU to change it. stop letting yourself be invisible and get out there. <br>  no text messages? send one.<br>  no one at the door? ring someone else's doorbell.<br>  no good tv? buy/rent dvds. feel good ones.<br>  no job? go find one.<br>  bad social life? call your friends, go out, party or go to dinner etc, meet new people, have fun! :) <br>  talking to people? talk to people yourself when you pass them or at least smile. <br>  <br>  never wait for people to do things for you. if you want something done - do it yourself. feel like you have no impact on the world? make sure you do. change it. help a charity. help a friend. or anything that makes you feel better. you will soon see how loved you really are. but you have to take the first steps. no one else can walk your path for you. it's all you. and you CAN do it. it's just a matter of believing in yourself. once you do that. others immidiatly follow.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	I feel the same way sometimes. You need to get in touch with your family and friends. Do things that take your mind off of the bad stuff for a while. Take up new hobbies. Read, watch movies, go out to eat, do what you like. Try not to be so hard on yourself. Life will get better, it just sucks sometimes. There are people who care.|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	sounds depressing lol<br>  <br>  do u have any achievements?<br>  do you want to set out any achievements?<br>  do you volunteer and help people (who need and want it) with their lives?<br>  <br>  I think at the moment, you have a need to feel wanted and important.<br>  <br>  what do you think you can offer the world?<br>  <br>  recommend:<br>  try to set goals that you want and achieve them<br>  volunteer - e.g. help prositutes get a better life<br>  socialise more<br>  go out more and meet people<br>  talk to people - almost anyone<br>  have an interesting hobby<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|iUtb3sq5aa	thats how i feel now.<br>  <br>  all my friends in school barley talk to me,<br>  no one ever calls me, or texts me anymore.<br>  no one asks to hang out with me.<br>  and no matter how hard i try, nothing changes.|`|JEj59j46aa	dont worry your not the only one, i cant tell enyone about my problems not evan my own family because they arent interested i feel hated unloved and alone.|`|7HYJG7q9aa	dude u just gatta get urslef together and not write on ******* yahoo answers bout ur problems i dont think u will get  much pitty but dude just put urself out there remember no guts no glory|`|JwXl7tuQaa	Why did you quit your job?  It sounds like it was the outlet you needed.  You need to get out and take a walk or call a friend or go visit someone.  You need to volunteer at a soup kitchen.  You need to get out and get moving.  DO NOT sit in your lonely room and let the lack of life get to you.  There is soooo much out there for you.  Go to church, get involved with something, anything that is positive.|`|OrLoeJsVaa	i know exactly how you feel, i go through that alot! i am now unemployed but i have finally started to go back to school. everyone tells me that i need to go to the doctor because its depression and other things but i don't want to. i am trying to get myself back together and i have been like this for like 2 years now. so i guess my advice would be to try and replace that feeling with something else, like work out or start a book or something and if that doesn't work i say its time to see a doctor.|`|YBzZ5Bgraa	You seem so sad. Maybe you should get another job. Or try to date someone. You need to find out what changed in your life that is making you so sad. You didn't mention a gf or bf, so is that the reason? You just need to get out there and do what make you happy.|`|qJU0S0Skaa	someone loves you dont be so hard on urself|`|Z21YpqQDaa	I felt like this before. I used to look up at the night sky in wonder, and just marvel at how insignificant i was. How even if i were to make some enormous impact on mankind, ever if i were to cure cancer, ultimately it would have virtually no impact on the universe and everything as a whole. I withdrew from friends and family, and like you, felt so alone and so depressed. What's more, my friends were too scared to really approach me, and i probably wouldn't have opened up to them even if they had. Yet i resented them for seemingly not caring, though they told me later they'd been deeply worried about me, but at a loss as to what to do.<br>  <br>  You have to reassess your priorities and start measuring your achievements on a more realistic and conceivable scale. It took time, but in truth i'm happy i went through what was undoubtedly the most unhappy and worst period of my life so far, if only because it made me stronger, and radically changed how i feel about myself for the better.<br>  <br>  And you're not "that" person. But perhaps you could do with reaching out to people more, and engaging in deeper rather than just superficial relationships. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, it will take time for you to feel better. But the ball is very much in your hands. Difficult as it may seem, you need to make it your incentive to actively change your life and how you feel about yourself.|`|vJvwYDGTaa	Everyone at one point of their life feels this way. And can I just say, its all in your imagination! If you want people to talk to you, call up some people and make plans! Go out to a bar or club, or if thats not your scene, just some place where you can mingle with people, and make that effort! Sitting at home and flooding yourself with all of this negativity and depression, isnt gonna make that phone ring, or door knock! People want to be around people who are confident in themselves, so you need to stop putting yourself down!<br>  <br>  And you'll really be able to test that at your next job! Its a perfect chance to start new!
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	More than likely they're just fantasizing. Getting married at 15 is a stupid idea and no parents who are in their right minds will consent to such a thing. This is not the 1200s anymore where a girl is to be married off when she hits puberty because she won't live past 40something. No one under 18 is able to support themselves, much less a spouse. Modern science has even proven that people are not capable of making adult decisions before age 25 because the human brain is still in adolescent mode until then.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Did they just time warp back to the 15th century?|`|oXfvBdNHaa	If they know its right and can support themselves financially, then whatever. If they are anything like me it will last. I've been with my fiance since I was 14 and we are now getting married at 20. He is self employed and I am an instructor for an after school program, and almost done with college. Some people DO know what love and commitment is at such a young age.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I think it's not even legal.<br>  If you have both parent's permission you can do it at 16. And you can't just say, "oh ya they said it's fine" they actually have to sign legal documents giving you permission.<br>  No exceptions.<br>  Otherwise you're waiting until you are 18.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Bad idea.<br>  But I don't think they can legally marry, anyway, and I think most ministers wouldn't do it...|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	I think it will never happen.  I'm sure her parents will have a few objections to that proposal.|`|AA11038292	Ok to get married you SHOULD be financially stable emotionaly stable and at 15 your neither of those your just starting life. You need to get an education and a solid career before even thinking about getting married. where will they live once they do in their parents house? because they can't buy a house or rent an apartment you must be an adult for that! YOU MUST BE AN ADULT TO GET MARRIED! this is just ridiculous! Hopefully someone will talk some sense into these children.|`|1M90Aoytaa	well they cannot actually legally get married yet, not sure on us law but in the uk its 16 with parents permission or 18 without. i think 15 is WAAAAY too young and they will have this long engagement then realise it wasnt real, go off to college and break up...maybe it will work out but i doubt it!|`|8ngDDwhVaa	I think it is legal, but only with parental permision. I doubt your freind would do this unless it is what he really wants to. It is his decision, not yours. If he asks your opinion on it, you can tell him you think it's to young, but otherwise just support him as much as you can.|`|Dowi63iuaa	Well, I personally would not get married at 15. Though, I do have a friend that married at 15. It all depends if they are really in love. Some teenagers believe they are in love.. Every teenager goes through it.. But if they are REALLY in love maybe its best.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	I think in any case, your parents know you best.<br>  <br>  She would need their approval to get married legally at that age, so it's probably a moot point.|`|ZXM4LNVaaa	i think it is good but first but not getting married.,just good friends like dating and do on.|`|4WdOqR1Kaa	that's a good way to throw both of your lives away....|`|MPfj42xDaa	I bet he's still going through puberty|`|0miYLXIpaa	I think 15 is too young of an age to really know what LOVE means particually what marriage is all about. I mean sure you can feel all those warm fuzzy feelings and know deep down in your heart that you're in love but saying this from experience you won't really know what love truly means until you gotten hurt. Marriage at 15 shouldn't be legal. even though these kids want to get married at a later age, i'm sure they'll realize what they are gettin themselves into|`|0Cy2PqA2aa	At 15 life is only just beginning and been a teenager is the most important part of growing up and decoding what career to take or university to study at. 15 is far too young to be thinking about getting married.|`|uKNoYYDfaa	it would have to be a very long engagement... but I can see it happening... had a friend of mine get married when she was 17 and is still happily married 19 years later.

ibOD8ggDaa	me as a girl i really don't like men who drink a little is ok|`|mefxIQP9aa	I'm not a heavy drinker either. I couldn't care whether the guy drinks or not as long as he's not an alcoholic.<br>  <br>  I guess they want a guy who wants to get them drunk and molest them afterward.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't get it either but don't worry about it. I think it's great that someone can talk to people without being sloshed. you don't meet a lot of guys who are like this so consider this a good thing.|`|AA11447210	People who enjoy drinking find it awkward to be around someone who isn't drinking or is against drinking. Not everyone drinks for courage, some of us simply enjoy the taste. <br>  <br>  I love my margaritas and on some weekend, I'll have a few. I wouldn't nix dating a guy who didn't drink at all, but it would certainly be more enjoyable (to me) for him to have few drinks socially as well, than sit there watching me (and anyone else present) get warm and fuzzy.|`|E2aN3ZBaaa	hm well maybe they see that awkward since every man and woman in this world drink alcohol<br>  and nope alcohol isn't necessary, maybe they are women who like the men to be drunk and do what they don't want them to do<br>  don't change that's a good thing that u don't drink like other guys<br>  :)|`|FEfUqngJaa	its only because they think that if you get drunk off you a#$ that you might sleep with them and its really stupid believe me don't fall for it stay strong with what your doing|`|b6LcC0CEaa	You're talking to the wrong kind of women then :)|`|AA11461524	no. i think its better if a guy doesnt drink, or just a lil ya kno.

Don't hang around with him anymore... He sounds like... the scum of the Earth.|`|TzHsjqcIaa	*That's a great question! My female friend was over the other day and she told me to bend over..what did she want??|`|RVxI2cR5aa	oh goodness... Well first when a guy tells you that he wants to have sex with you which your 13 and thats not good that your 15 year old friend is telling you that. next time he says that tell him my legs are closed for bussiness sorry: ]|`|yTLnOk6uaa	*speechless* i really don't understand the situation, or simply don't want to... if that is exactly what happened, tell him to f-off. he's not a friend...|`|zBB2AFMbaa	I'm going to take a different track than the other people answering this question. You should open your legs.|`|qfTgWDj2aa	Because he's not a real friend. He just wants to have sex with you. I suggest you keep your distance from him. He shouldnt have asked you that|`|zUVMLcMKaa	don't open ur legs, cuz there's only one thing that will go in.|`|M04ixk9saa	He wants what you got|`|xbjc2yzOaa	He wants to have sex with you HAHAH aw little kids are so cute|`|THvfGib9aa	agree with the first person.|`|AA10644478	he wants sex!|`|LhC6UBWXaa	he wants to boof your pooterwho
rWgt6EL9aa	Yes he likes you.  8th grade is still really young so dont rush you have the rest of your life.  Its up to him to decide  if he wants to break up with his girlfriend and go out with you. <br>  Sometimes its better just to stay friends, really close friends, because once you date, things never go back to what were before you dated.|`|FlzU20bLaa	I think he does like you. A lot. And maybe he has thought about asking you out in the past, before he got a gf, and fears rejection. IDK.  But the main point is that it sounds like he really likes you.<br>  <br>  And yeah, I totally agree with the person above me.
tU5NJVL3aa	Of the famous designer and fragrance family (e.g., designers of the Air India hostess uniforms), originally residing in the Champs Elysées, Paris?|`|iizKx4Bvaa	what movie was she in. was that the one where she plays a nurse.
18hRm0gLaa	Well that sucks and I'd get back together with her if at all possible.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	It sounds like she may have finally given up on you for good and realized that you couldn't handle a relationship. You're still young, you don't have to fall in love with everyone you date. You ARE definitely jealous but you don't really have any reason to be. You definitely still have feelings for her. I feel kind of the same because my ex who hurt me and lied to me (but I still love and have feelings for) is talking to someone new and it makes me SO jealous and he knows it. Yeah I'm having trouble sleeping and eating too. You really do care about her and you probably do love her. <br>  <br>  Find out if she's already become exclusive with this new guy. If not, you still have a chance. She most likely still has feelings for you or else she wouldn't have stuck around so long, she would have just moved on way sooner. Tell her what you told us, that you really care and it hurts you she may be with another guy. Let her know how you feel. You never really get over your first love, you just learn to deal with it.|`|RI1brp91aa	Aww that's so cute. <br>  <br>  You love her.<br>  <br>  the signs are right there, you are afraid to come to terms with them, but you loved/love her.|`|xviRyUPlaa	sounds to me like you love her...but only you can decide that
68VsaQTraa	It's a question of morality.<br>  <br>  Do you put your own desires and needs ahead of his two kids and his wife?

The age gap is pretty large and since he has a family that makes it very bad. I understand you liking him but continuing this will NOT end well, these things never do and your cirumstance is no different. But be careful if you try to end it, you never know what he might do. If I was you, I would try to subtly end it.|`|cNX8jV2Waa	wow, that's tough...<br>  <br>  i think u shud just try to back out of the relationship, he's treating u sortof unfairly by putting u in the situation.

I'm sure he still loves her and his kids but he probably wants new experiences-people can get tired with their spouses when it comes to the physical attraction.  God bless you if your happily married for 5 years with a healthy physical and emotional relationship.  Also, maybe he's taking into consideration how much he's hurting not only his family (if they find out) but also you...and himself...and maybe he's trying to stop what he's been doing for the better.  I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt, though...stop now and you're practically getting away with murder...try.

(which would really not be good, cuz think of his kids!) why do you want to surround yourself with this type of person? if you can attract the attention of a 10 year older man, i have trouble doubting you couldn't find an available guy, somewhere closer to your age maybe? really gurl, ask yourself, is he really worth it? is he really worth you? i am not tryin to be mean, i just want you to understand. plz do not take part in this man destroying his life. who's he gonna blame when his wife finds out and (most likely) leaves him? who's gonna carry the guilt for the rest of your life? i think its almost too late, but better late than never, hun. end it. good luck with it all, and i hope you make the right choice...|`|hf5RgDzwaa	well think about it<br>  put your self in his wifes shoes<br>  amagine you have babys and a life with them and your love is messin with other women<br>  trust me it will hurt her way more and so for her kids<br>  if i were you try to break it off. it seems hes just in need of affection cuz if he really did love you or like you you grow together by personal friendship not go stright into the sex and makeouts like you kno? you only go stright to that kinda stuff when you just like the feeling of it. <br>  i would try to break if off by finding someone else, or talk to him and ask why is he doing this<br>  dont believe everything hes gona say cuz hes gona try to cover things up. <br>  see your young and hot and guys will always get sprung on younger women and its hard for them to resist.<br>  try to find another guy to give your affection to and at the end you'll see you didnt really need him, you were just sprung to his affection he was giving you|`|zsn7lrThaa	I really want you to think about this. There's no need for judgments or mean comments, but come on! What are your expectations? They are not real, they are tainted. If he indeed would do this to one, then he would do it again. The thrill of the chase and the kill has been met, but, unfortunately, you gave in to easily. How do you know that he doesn't have a disease or that his wife doesn't? He's not in love with you. He goes home to another woman. IF, he were separated, totally different scenario. This is a lose-lose for everyone involved. Get some one, who has some dignity left. Being with no one is better than a bad relationship. I know you are thinking this too.......It's not love!

Chances are you two have different styles of communicating affection.<br>  <br>  You seem to be a "physical touch person". So you give him the type of love you want to receive. This is actually not as wonderful as you might think. He might not even like back rubs, he might prefer to recieve kind words, or little token gifts.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, he might be trying to show you that he cares by giving the type of love he likes to receive...<br>  <br>  You can really grow your relationship if you understand how to give love the way your partner likes to receive it. This increases the odds oyu can get love the way you prefer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, God Bless!|`|1M90Aoytaa	my fiance doesnt like giving me shoulder rub - i suffer neck and shoulder problems and i frequently give him a full body massage with oils ...the works - if i ask he will give me one for about a minute then give up. i dont think its selfish jsut something he doesnt like doing or more likely something he never thinks about - he probably thinks if you want one you will ask him for one - mens minds dont work like womens if you dont make it clear they are oblivious, is he selfish in other areas? if this is the only area and if he does it when you ask i think its jsut men being men|`|AA10086844	no, it is a sure sign that he is a man.  They just don't think about these things a lot of time.  Most of them are more than happy to help when they can and when they think about it (or you ask) but they typically just don't think of the little things like that.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|U5T1OS7daa	Not everyone shows how they care in the same way. While you show it by pampering, he may show it in another way. <br>  Most of the guys I know would rather a woman tell them what they want (sometimes more than others) than to guess. <br>  He may be selfish, or just not on the same 'page' as you. <br>  Does he do it for you after you ask? If so, maybe that's his way of knowing what to do to please you.<br>  If he gives you a hard time about giving you a back rub after you ask, find out the reasons for his refusal, and go from there.|`|UAF8Zxzaaa	Maybe he's just oblivious. Sometimes certain people won't do it on their own because they never know the appropriate time. But it would be kind of selfish if he always said no. But ask him why first before assuming it's just selfishness.

I think you act the way you do because in a way you don't want him to know you like him.  It's kind of like a defense mechanism like when boys and girls in elementary school acting mean to one another when they really like each other.<br>  <br>  Just try to be yourself.  Talk about what you normally would talk about online, or you can bring up a topic that you know you two were talking about before and add to it.  If he still doesn't talk to you, chances are that he's probably shy to be around you too.  If he didn't like you at all he wouldn't talk to you so openly online.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped :)
5qUUP1Rsaa	Hi Dude, its seems that you are really feeling very troubled over this issue as you has really pour out alot of stuff over here. I have faced a similar issue as you before when my girlfriend is not my girl yet. <br>  <br>  Initially, we did chat like good friends on msn, on phone and even going out for an outing together but when I started getting closer, she move back. Its seems to be their way of moving a step back to think through before committing into the relationship. What I can advice is just be yourself and be like friends, it may be hurtful while trying to be so but bear with it and once you see the right opportunities, make the effort to be a man and approach her to ask her again.|`|mTfhwrriaa	If she didn't ever call you back or pick up the phone, she was probably too shy to say no to you. I'm sorry, but I have a hunch that she'd rather just be friends. :(|`|ck2GSl2Saa	no need to 'introduce yourself' just tell us your problem in a sentence or two because we tend to get bored when it comes to three.|`|2vgbJhlRaa	lol honestly i skimmed through most of it only! but from what i did read it sounds like shes not interested.....move on and get someone who likes you for yourself! btw thats how karma does it. not saying your a bad guy just you need to give other girls a chance to...Best of luck|`|F3o3EVtFaa	Holy crap you should publish that! jk...<br>  <br>  So... I think you should let her go. But if you're determined....<br>  <br>  I think it would be cool to do some research and find out where she lives. Try using some mutual friends.... Then go to that place and try to find her. Either show her that you did ALL this work just for her, and she'll think you're really wanting her and sweet and stuff. Or pretend you just happened to be in the same place at the same time. It's a lot of work though....<br>  <br>  Or change your phone number or use another phone and call her and just casually talk and then see about doing something with her.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|cNX8jV2Waa	wow! thats a hard situation! i would first contact some of her friends, and ask them how she's been, just 2 make sure that everything is alright with her, and she isnt avoiding your calls for another reason. then i would call her, and say that you are really sorry for scaring her like that, and that you would like to be friends with her again, (even if thats not what u want to do) She will probably respond to that by saying something like "Sure", or something like "actually u didnt scare me, i would like to have a date"<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps you!|`|kGSZvLxbaa	Talk to some of your friends that know her. Get them to help you, if theyre good friends theyll help you! Maybe have a friend of yours and hers throw a party and at the party approach her and tell her your sorry and how you feel about her. If you open up to her, shes likely to open up to you. And remember dont give up. This happened to me and I gave up and I regret giving up every single day. Good luck!|`|lfOgYA5paa	first of all, that was a lot to read<br>  second of all, shes deffinately not interested in you, or she died or something. you guys can try to be friends, but she is not looking for anything more and you need to understand that.<br>  third of all, try dating someone not in your ethnic minority. i can understand how thats important to you but that really limits your options and you are way less likely to find someone you can really get along with.|`|KSMU64ssaa	Well, you can't know what she's thinking until she tells you. (But I ge why you don't want to scare her.) Phone her again for one last time, and even if she doesn't answer, leave a message saying " I really want to get to know you better." or something more casual than "oh my gosh you're beautiful!" Just come up with something to say. <br>  After that, leave it up to her. You can't keep waiting around for her. Also, maybe if you give her time she'll come around. <br>  Good Luck!|`|oAYCestzaa	this is what I think ...I think she never actually knew you were interested in her like that and always considered you a friend..to be honest if she really liked you when you guys chatted over facebook and stuff she would have probably said something really flirty or like hey lets hang out but she might not have felt any spark and only thought of you as a friend..and I think over the phone she was just taken aback and said yes quickly because she didnt want to sound mean since you told me she was friendly and yeah maybe she is really busy but heres the thing if she really liked you she would have found the time to call you / hang out and stuff shes just not that into you i think you should move on you will find other girls who will be just as into you as you are into them dont worry there are loads of other girls !!  :)|`|01eab8b96781f0707c87b8a2cf3dabf5aa	You should call or text her a short note.

Tell her u would just like to talk, you miss talking to her and let her know you would like to know why she never called you back. If she doesn't answer your call or text you back, you will know for sure where you stand. Then you can free yourself up to meet someone else.|`|mKOxr4Lwaa	let her go<br>  <br>  it's obvious that she for whatever reason didn't want to go  out with you.<br>  <br>  keep looking<br>  <br>  don't waste your time on her|`|OkKZItpPaa	Maybe you should condense this a bit?? =S|`|UXxDUjnMaa	well i didnt read it all cause thats kinda y i go to schoo and all, but...aaahhh... everything happens for a reason, if she's not right for u than she's not the one for u. who knows buddy u might have your own giselle bunchen or alessandra ambrosio waiting for ya man. she's prolly just pms-ing or something. so yeah just let it be. hope i help :)|`|uEFyMwj1aa	Leave her a voicemail saying basically everything you said up there.

FsmcCXlvaa	Get him a book or show him an article about all the changes your body is going through. Growing a baby is exhausting... Some men don't take our word for it and need "proof" that our symptoms are real. Maybe if were a little more informed about pregnany, hormonal changes, fatigue, insomnia, etc than he'd be a little more understanding. Or you could always just tell him to back off. Tell him you'll get things done in your own time and ask him to leave you alone.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Go and buy 3 bags of 20 pound potatoes and make him carry them around on him everywhere he goes. If he questions you tell him to f**k off. You should not tolerate that sort of disrespect from a man, tell him to pull his own weight and work 2 jobs coz your preggars and tired. If not get a divorce, you should not have married him in the first place, he sounds like a very selfish man.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	You tell him honey. Back up and please stay in your lane.

If my girlfriend was pregnant, i wouldn't expect one thing of her except to relax and let me take care of her, i wouldn't be penalizing for not making a list of stuff she did today.<br>  <br>  Tell him you want him to support you more, like ease up a bit on the "anything you can do, i can do better." you're his wife. That should be enough for him. If anything he shouldn't be out doing "fun stuff".|`|ZOazfrjUaa	well. maybe you should get to know someone before you  marry them. you wouldnt be going through this if you wouldnt have married him would you? sorry hun. cant help you.
nqINitkmaa	It is their responsibility to pay for their own travel expenses. I am having a destination wedding, while I am helping out the bridal party, the other guests are on their own, if they would like to attend the wedding they can pay for plane fare and such. You can't be expected to pay for some of his family, for one it gets expensive and for two once you start paying for people it will be hard to draw the line on where to stop paying for people. Plus the two of you are paying for this on your own, so his family can spend a couple hundred dollars for a hotel or plane ticket.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	You are right.  It is their responsibility to pay for travel and lodging.  Let them know that if they can't afford it you'll miss them. Don't even get near the topic of you paying for them. Otherwise everyone will find out and expect you to pay for them too. (unless it's your parents.  They are the exception lol)
Hfp80ylEaa	It sounds like you're in a rather good situation.  Why risk the friction by wanting to have a party and a signed paper?   Think about it, after the ceremony your situation will be exactly the same.  When you get married there isn't some magical transformation that goes on.  Maybe he is nontraditional, you mentioned he "doesn't need a piece of paper" and that's similar to how I feel.  If you love him, he loves you and you have a healthy environment for the baby, why chance a good thing?  He has probably given up things to make your relationship work as have you.  Maybe this wish is one that should be put aside.   Who knows maybe one day he will surprise you.  <br>  <br>  Do you really want to roll the dice?   You're a mother, think of the baby.  It sounds like he's a good father.|`|SsfnitjXaa	He has already told you he does not want a piece of paper with you.  When the right girl comes along he will marry her in a heart beat.

Just ask him "Are we going to get married?" If he says there is no need, just explain the legal aspects and that it means a lot to you. If he says yes, just ask when you think you will. Tell him it is important to you, and if that isnt enough of a hint, ask him yourself.|`|AA10928125	After alot of years of marriage you finally realize MEN cannot read our minds...it took me awhile(lol). If you have been together for 7 yrs and have a baby...tell him you've been planning a real wedding since you were 12 yrs. old..when is he gonna make that dream come true? <br>  Marry me darn it! keep us informed..good luck~!|`|6XcUZI9Yaa	Why don't you ask him to marry you?|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	Look, I'm going to be blunt here because I have had a kind of similar experience. After being together for 6 years and having a child together this man cannot commit, and that says a lot. You need to decide what is more important: getting married or having this man in you and your child's life.<br>  <br>  I became pregnant after only months of dating my husband to be (I know I know). He would talk all the time about how he wanted to marry me, but that was it...talk. So I stepped up and said "you talk so much about this, but when were you actually thinking about making it happen?" He said that since I became pregnant so soon, he wants to make sure we get along great before getting into a legal marriage, and that he also wants to save at least a little money for a ring and a wedding. Well, my daughter is now 5 months old and we are getting married in the winter. We have really gotten to know each other and fell  deeply in love during my pregnancy and the first months of our daughter's life. It had been stressful, and we have made it through like pros, which says a lot about our compatibility.<br>  <br>  You need to trust your instincts. Why isn't this man marrying you after this long, living together and having a child together? And you're right, if you want a marriage, but you feel he'd be forced into it, maybe you don't have the same traditions an goals in life. A lot to think about.|`|cE0Xat61aa	because he's probably comfortable in the situation you're in.  or maybe he doesn't have the money for a ring or a wedding, you know with raising a baby and all. This is why i always tell people, especially girl, don't "play" wifey without the ring first! You should have talked about getting married before having his baby, now it's all going to depend on if and when the situation is right. Or another reason it could be that he just doesn't want to get married! again you should have thought of it before acting like a wife, without the piece of paper. :(  good luck tho!|`|1M90Aoytaa	does he realise you want to get married?? maybe he sees no need - you have the house and the kid, some peolple see marriage as jsut a bit of paper and that theres no need for it, bring it into converstation and find out how he feels about it, tell him youd really like to get married!! you could always propose to him? or just ask him, shall we get married? who asked who to move in/ have a baby? maybe he just doesnt realise it means so much to you!|`|AA10621162	I will tell you what I've told at least 5 other friends and women on this site: He will never marry you. What's the point? You live together, have a child together, and have sex with him as if your married. He doesn't have enough respect for because if he did, you wouldn't be asking this question.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	He is already getting all the pro's of being married. Avoiding hassle and expense are more important to him then making you happy. Or, he doesn't know it's important to you.<br>  <br>  Sit down when you are having a good day, not in the middle of a fight, and tell him you want to be married. Give him the reasons, ie;<br>  <br>  1. I want to feel like a "lady". It is important to my morals.<br>  2. I want our family to be protected... in case something ever happened to you we would need life insurance benefits to survive.<br>  3. I want other guys to know I am off the market forever, that my guy has made it clear to the world that never wants to share me.<br>  4. I want to be able to make the best choices for you if were in the hospital. Right now, your parents would have the right.<br>  <br>  Give him a chance to talk about what marriage means to him. He might feel bad that he can't afford a big fling. Let him know for you it is about the marriage, not about the wedding. Tell him you love him enough to do it in a court if that would make him happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck, God Bless!|`|7jEY7Z2waa	You need to talk to him about this.<br>  Its a big step but hey you have a house and a baby together. <br>  <br>  Its only going to show you how much he loves you.<br>  <br>  Im in the same boat except no baby and been waiting about 2years.<br>  <br>  Or ask him. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.
iizKx4Bvaa	If she has fallen out of love with you. I suggest you start the healing process cause you cannot make someone love you unless she is just saying that to hurt you. I dont know the dynamics of your relationship. good luck|`|FsmcCXlvaa	The kids deserve better than this and I definitely think you should both go to counseling. If you can't convince her to go than you should do it on your own to prove you want to work on the relationship. Maybe a neutral family member can mediate the situation and encourage her to work on the relationship and maybe even go to counseling. At the end of the day it isn't going to work if you're the only one trying but perhaps if you lead by example she'll come around. If not, at least you'll know you did everything you could.|`|9AI4TECmaa	first of all if u havent watched the movie fireproof, u should. There is a book called The Love dare, read it. Fireproof is a great movie and the book is really wat helped the couple with theirrelationship. The movie is great! i really recomend it. If u like the movie u should by The Love Dare (which is the book the man uses in the movie to save his marriage). Hope this helps.|`|2RPtsrQGaa	for the kids sake i hope she would work it out but if she doesn't love u anymore then that won't be the way to bring the kids up either
CXSVaiBMaa	lmao haha i was in a similair situation well not the whole being horny all the time thing but the getting turned on by him being an asswhole but wut i found out is if he acts like he doesnt give a sh*t its because he really doesnt if he asked u to be friends with benefits he doesnt rly care about u he just wants to fu** i mean do whatever u want do him or dont but the best advice i can give u is dont get attached to him b/c he does not love you and he will end up hurting u breaking ur heart w/e u wanna call it.|`|Yosd3uSPaa	talk to me on messenger this is confusing?|`|8zu3a4fIaa	i will take care of you !!!!!|`|g1ciF3DVaa	email me haha|`|JvbvGtrBaa	please don't let him screw you over<br>  is that really a turn on <br>  watching him cheat on you cause you guys were only friends with benifits<br>  personally i only date guys that will stick around or convince me enough to believe it. <br>  friends with benifits is bullshittt<br>  why not date eachother until you think you can commit.<br>  just hang out movies, parties, dinner, don't let him use you. find out what his intentions are ask him. <br>  and if you don't want to date or be in a relationship then i guess friends with benifits shouldn't bother u <br>  but it'd bother the hell outta me

piw5oJ44aa	I think you should break up with him, he's obviously lying to you. That can't be a good relationship if he lies to you just to save your feelings. Don't worry about what the girl said to you, a lot of times people call others what they really are.<br>  If he really loved you then he would have asked you to marry him. i mean 6 six years is a long time to just to be boyfriend and girlfriend.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	Be over it and stay over it. He's a liar and your children need a healthy, happy mother to raise them. Drop him like a hot rock.  Good luck, girl!|`|5HoZ3NHeaa	He's a player|`|xIwPjhojaa	READ YOUR ??? It will answer it self !! move on or you are CO DEPENDENT ????|`|AA11814313	I think sometimes we feel stuck by love or the commitment to our children to have their father.  This man is lying to you and his so called friend showed no respect to you or him or she would not have answered you or got involved.  BTW I know of men who cheat on their wife's and their gf's tell the wife they r friends.  I think you need to go to counseling with this man and on your own and work out what is true what is not and what you should do.  Than remember you are a hot mama of 2 and any man should cherish you and treat you as you do him.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	well its tough, my wife of 5 yrs has been talking to a old HS friend, then one day she said she wanted a divorce, and well guess what now she is dating the guy she went to HS with. So you need to really find out whats going on, if this dont stop, sorry to say you need to move with your life, Iam 40 now and waiting for divorce papers and while she is out having fun with her old HS friend. So look what has happend to me even though your not married, same thing can happen to you, he can walk anytime or just go out and have his fun while your home.|`|C9brWMriaa	For what I have read, you really haven't asked a question.  You are living with a man who is a known liar which you have had to bail out of jail twice and your only concern is that another woman called you co-dependant.  You have issues that you must address.  I would suggest that you take a good long look in the mirror and ask yourself is this the kind of life your want for your children.|`|fYOWyIEXaa	Well sorry to tell you dear but your family is wrong. You and your boyfriend are entitled to have personal friends in addition to your couple friends, there is no law that says when you are in a relationship that the only friends you can have are the ones your partner is friends with as well.<br>  <br>  Now your boyfriend is wrong for lying to you about his friendship, but that is the only thing I can see that you have the right to be mad over. Unless you have something else that you are not telling us, I am inclined to believe the other lady when she said it is platonic.<br>  <br>  You say that at 36 you don't want to "put up with these childish lying games" but dear you are playing childish games as well by going through your boyfriend's phone while he is sleeping and then on top of that you texted the girl which is something you had no business doing. Talk about games, well you my dear are playing your fair share of them.<br>  <br>  I can understand why he lied to you about talking to her. I would have done the same thing if you put the same orders to me that you did to him.|`|mPfDlG2Laa	He hasn't been right to you for a long time.  Guys can have female friends, but they don't hide them from their Sig O's!  And, um, "co-dependent?"  That would mean he is a "dependent."  So, she is throwing out words that she can't even define since she cannot use them in correct context...  Dump the guy, let him have his truck-stop waitress genius and you find a guy that would love you and your children and treat y'all right.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Hmm, I have to wonder if after 6 years you don't have enough evidence to support ending this relationship. If his family thinks he is a habitual liar, and you find that to be true, if he's going behind your back with 'her' and he's been breaking the law (he's a bit anti-social isn't he?). umm, I get the impression he's a real catch (for the cops), and this is not setting a healthy example for your children.<br>  <br>  You're a good looking lady and you are still young. You have way too many options than to be stuck in this mess. You deserve to be happy and your kids deserve some 'sanity' and stability in their lives.<br>  <br>  You know what to do.|`|5ZKdo0Tqaa	i would say you have every right to be upset, <br>  if he can not respect your feelings, and what you have asked of him then he doesnt really care about you...<br>  worst part is hes still continuing to lie to you about it, <br>  if there is nothing sooo serious then why the lies and hiding? <br>  how are u suppose to trust him after that? <br>  i would leave|`|efDvTjJSaa	feel reassured that her co-dependant line made no sense with the actual situation so clearly she is just a twat who tried to say somthing cleaver and failed xx<br>  <br>  as for whats going on, i wouldnt accept it, nor should you, he should respect your feelings as your partner<br>  <br>  im not meaning this in a bad way towards you but<br>  if he really loved you and cared about you his relationship with this other girl would be easily thrown out|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i cant believe you are putting up with this at 36!!! thats insane. u know what to do,leave the guy. hes worthless and just a cheater,if there was nothing going on then you guys shouldve dont double dates or he would have had her over for dinner with you home,but instead he sneaks behind your back. open your eyes and realize he dont care.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	I think his families assessment of a pathological liar is correct, and after six years with him I'm sure you can confirm that also. I seriously doubt this other woman doesn't mean anything to him. Why would he keep in contact with her if she doesn't mean anything to him? He's a liar, and a very immature one too. I have doubts that will change. <br>  <br>  You seem to be a sensible, caring person. You've given your partner more than his fair share of chances to get his act together, and you're getting lies and cheating in return. You deserve more than you're receiving in this relationship....and so do the children. <br>  <br>  You have two choices #1 Continue in the relationship, which has no<br>  chance of ever becoming a happy positive environment for you or your children. #2 Terminate the relationship, and sever all ties with him, only<br>  allowing contact for child support and visitation.<br>  <br>  Your only 36 years old ( just a baby yet! kidding) there is plenty of time to find Mr. Right and get treated with the love, happiness and respect you deserve. You will be an even more loving, affection Mother<br>  when your treated that way, and your children deserve that, do it for them to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  God Bless
xKgZAp1Oaa	you're dumb|`|NlSzmPddaa	You should just wait for him to text you if he doesn't text you within a week i would say he is selfish and doesn't care about you. useally if they do care about you they will text you within 4 or 5 days, and they really suck up because they are afraid there losing you. its going to be really hard waiting but you cant do it :) good luck ;]|`|SouPhkgxaa	ummm...????

When children are made fun of by their parents it's the worst experience of all. Children should find comfort and safety in the family. Doing this will drive them away, close up, become afraid and untrusting and shy. They will have trouble expressing their feelings and won't fit into social events as easy as others. It's a really bad thing for an age of assertiveness.<br>  Please talk to him about this and tell him to stop making fun of the kids. Ask him why he behaves this way. Talk to him seriously about it. It hurts your feelings. If he will make fun of you, that's really bad, because it means he really doesn't respect you. He should realise what's going on. And really make a point about this!! If he won't cooperate, do what he'd fear most you'd do to him, for a while. So he can realise it's serious. Be strong and keep your position. If he changes for the good, be very affectionate and ecourage him.
DNwHGeEtaa	Well, he doesn't want you to talk to that girl again, but he still talks to her? If he was so concerned about that, he shouldn't have talked to that girl either. I just don't understand how he could be upset with a girl who talks bad about his girlfriend, not want his girlfriend to talk to this girl again, but he still talks to her. Just doesn't make sense. <br>  <br>  Anyway if you think what he's doing is right (which I don't think so), you should explain him that you didn't talk to that girl much, you just tried to be polite and that was it. If he's still upset about you talking to a girl that he also talks to, then just let him be upset. There's nothing you can do to please this guy.

ZtfN4J6taa	Why in the world would you have a baby and marry an 18 year old !  Common sense would have told you not to, and now you are crying the blues. You married a kid and expect him to act like a man !<br>  You are pretty immature yourself for marrying an 18 year old boy.|`|KiUlBCEPaa	You both are too inmature to have a child ,,, he is 18 and you are 24?Your dad pays your bills? Grow up , take responsibility and both of you get a freakin job and pay your own way ,,, if he doesn't want anything to do with the baby , then that should tell you his level of maturity and if you are crazy enough to put up with  him not working or wanting the baby then that shows your level of maturity.|`|e1oky4jSaa	How old are you guys? First of all, your father should not be paying all of your bills. My husband and I are 24 and 25 and made 140,000 a year last year on our own. His parents are both dead and one of mine is. We didn't have someone wiping our butts and we did it on our own. Not all men are like that no; and the fact that he has zero interaction with your daughter is horrible. Good luck sweetie, I hope it gets better for you.|`|AKl0n2Liaa	I would honestly say, that you shouldn't try raising two kids alone, because he's a kid too. He's not man enough to get a job so that your dad doesn't have to pay the bills. Parents are only required to take care of us until we're 18. No harm, but maybe you both need to grow up and when you do, make sure you find someone who is just as mature as you will one day be!|`|jBigEy0Caa	Oh man, that explains part of the problem.  He is 18 yrs old!  He needs to stop hanging out with his friends and get a job.  Not all men are like him.  My husband was better than I was with my kids especially when they were babies.  Give yourself a break and make him help you out.  He may decide that he needs to actually take care of his family if he has to start taking some responsibility.|`|zsn7lrThaa	Come on. Do you really have to ask for advice on this? People can make babies, but not everyone can be a parent. Your poor daughter! You can't teach compassion and empathy. It is within you upon birth.

A lot of men would like to skip out on the diaper changing and maybe some of the feedings, but generally they like to be involved and play with their babies.  Your husband is young, but it's no excuse for him to act like the way he's acting.  You can't get him to care about his daughter, that's something he has to do on his own.  You should try to work things out, first, but if he doesn't come around, then maybe you should consider moving on.  Just understand you and your father are enabling him to stay immature, by not making him take on his responsibilities.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	1 - Don't have any more kids until you can support yourself.  Seriously, I say this with love.  Your daddy ain't running no daycare.<br>  2 - C'mon, admit it.  He was lazy when you met him.  You couldn't have thought marriage and a baby was going to make him change.<br>  3 - No not all men are like that.  Cut your losses while you still have time to find someone else.  Most guys don't mind a single mom, especially when the kid is just a baby.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	guys dont mature until like their mid 20s. and why is he spending so much time at the gym when he doesn't have a job, and your father is paying the bills? do you feel right about this? i know i wouldnt. i would be embarrased. and he sounds like the type, that when yall get in a fight he leaves. and also, if he stayed at home bc he knows its going to tick you off if he doesnt, yall will just be miserable together. and about the baby, hes just not ready. he is too young and would rather be with his buddies. girl you need to get on that sh**! you need to put your foot down and say hey! i dont know what the hell you are thinking, but we have a baby TOGETHER and you need to start acting like it. you also need a job! and if that doesnt go clear through his head kick him to the curb.|`|PeMpDAbraa	No not all men are like this. Your father shouldn't be paying all the bills...you BOTH should be taking care of yourselves. You should have never laid down with a kid. He is immature and it sounds like he could care less about what happens with his relationship to you and to your child. Also I wouldn't call him a boxer if he doesn't get paid for it. How does he get money to do anything with his friends? How does he get around? Who pays for his Gym membership? Tell him to grow up and be a father and a husband or to get lost!|`|VQs0adT8aa	So, you're both deadbeat moochers.  At least you're not on welfare, because I can't stand the idea of my hard-earned tax dollars supporting losers.  And he's barely past high school (or is he actually still in school?), meaning he's probably too young to really understand the commitments of fatherhood or even marriage.  Hang on a second while I recover from the shock that your life isn't working out so well.  <br>  <br>  Normally I'm not so rude on here, but you need to wake up, dearie.<br>  <br>  Did you plan this baby together?  I would NOT have a baby with my husband if I had any doubts about his being intimately involved in raising the child.  I'm guessing you didn't consider that at all.<br>  <br>  Getting him to grow up enough to be a great father and husband would involve him making so many changes in himself that it's probably not fair of you to expect of another person.  So yeah, you should probably leave.<br>  <br>  And get a job.
2sLuZJM6aa	you can tell your mom, or you could explain to your dads gf that she is a nutcase and should go to a mental institution. your dad might ground you but you only go over there sometimes. its what i would do but when i dont like people i tell it to them straight. i say i dont like you (i hate you) and i tell them why. then i tell them what they should do with their life, ex. you need to check yourself into a mental institution. but only say that if yah want. it all depends on the person and what they feel like doing. just express your feelings.|`|TJzKE3oqaa	whats the real question here. what should you do are what you want your dad to do. i don't think you have any control of that but one day you can ask your dad to talk when you are alone. if his gf is there don't ask to  talk alone with him.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Sorry, it sounds like a drag.

If she breaks the law, you can call the police, and that's about it.<br>  <br>  You can talk to your dad maybe, and see if you can't persuade him to leave her.  Or you can visit him less.  But unfortunately it sounds like you're already making the best of a bad situation.  I'm so sorry you have to grow up like this.  Just study hard and start your own life when you're 18, I bet you'll make tons better choices! :-)
SztleLnUaa	I understand how you must feel.<br>  Your dad still loves you, I'm sure. He has probably got too many responsibilities, as the family grew. His work is important to be able to support you all, but I'm sure not more than you are to him. It's just that sometimes we get caught in this crazy everyday life and we are full of stress to notice what really goes on around us, with the people  who are most important to us. I know that, because I act like this sometimes with my little son and then I feel guilty and try to make it up to him.<br>  I think he might not be very happy  too, if he gets home and listens to all this fighting after a day's work. How is his relationship with your mother? This is very important as well.<br>  Your mother seems to have lost control and that makes things worst.<br>  Try to talk to him without shouting. Be calm, but clear to what you miss in your relationship and what you need.<br>  If you can't make it to this animal auction, arrange something else that you can do the two of you. Customers are not more important than you, but they still are important!<br>  Good luck!|`|AA10500537	try spending more time with him at work when you;re not in school tell him how you feel.<br>  ask him to go to a movie or for a burger with you  maybe he;ll realize how left out you feel|`|JvbvGtrBaa	of course your dad loves you. <br>  the economy is difficult and the reason he  is working so hard is to support you and his family. <br>  you've gone years and years so stay fond of your memories, it's ok if one year hes needs a little time to bring home the doh. <br>  no one understands you like me right now, i was the third last child of my mothers and she slapped me till my nose bled. my dad never did much about it accept let my mom leave him in arizona and move to oregon. i was allways a daddies girl i love him alot but i had to let go and grow up, i hit puberty and we stoped talking everyweekend he  didn't know how to be the role model i needed i guess. i can accapt that and move on to become my own role model.<br>  it's nice that hes still around for movies, i'm sorry about your mom fighting and he does nothing about it. i don't think they know what to do. oh my dad doesn't like spending money on me (he doesn't have anyway)in general men are just like that unless they're gay thats the exception. they don't shop to well.<br>  if your mom ever bruises you call the child care services or 911 wake her up, she needs help and doesn't know it. someone needs to help her realize what she is doing to her kids, it'll only get worse probebly too|`|AosW4IvHaa	He is on overload.  He cares about you the most.. He has to support you and everyone else in the family... He must keep that money coming in to support the family... Be glad of that.. He love you and. U need to grow up.  You have no idea how difficult it is to make it now a days.. <br>  I know you're too young to understand at this time.  Sorry your hurting...|`|RUkf4ND0aa	aw<3 i think that you should confront him again. this time, you should be assertive. maybe he just doesn't realize wht hes doing. being in a troubling marriage can get a little stressful, but things can work out. maybe you should print this out and have him read it... it seems like you have true and deep feelings written down and maybe that will help. when you confront him, make sure tht it's a one on one thing and tht you both have some time on your hands. maybe you should look into trying to go to his work with him or something so you can spend some time together and see wht he likes to do.<br>  <br>  - side note, you should talk to someone about your mother abusing you. thts really bad.|`|dmxHQ0kTaa	Who knows men seem to be able to lose that bonding connection .  I'm an only child and was daddy's girl but now that he got re-married he replaced me with his wife and HER dumb kid.  He never spends time with me hardly ever talks to me give them everything gives me nothing.  So  I guess I know how you feel but just try to spend more time with him.|`|5wzjFFChaa	Wow. Your situation seems so diffiucult. But here's what I have to say.<br>  Your dad still loves you, it's just that your relationship with his is becoming more distant as time goes by. I think it's good for you that you sit in your room because of your mom and all, but you should tell your dad what's going on, even if he doesn't keep his promises (like how he doesn't do stuff with you.) Also, try and suggest doing things with him when he comes into the room, like playing some Scrabble or whatever, and if he just says no, point out that he promised. and gradually your relationship will get closer. Maybe the reason why you think he cares about his customers more is because he spends more time with them. However, maybe it's because of your mom. You said, tshe is abusive? Well, maybe he feels a lot of pain when she abuses you and doesn't know what to do, even though he's on your side. <br>  <br>  This might seem a little extreme, but this reminds me of the book "A Child Called It." It's very sad, but I think it might help you.<br>  <br>  I sincerely think you need to get serious help. About your mom, I mean. If she is that abusive then I think you should tell your teacher or the police or somebody. Because I know that you really need help.<br>  Just tell somebody what's going on in your life.|`|dElKBtnJaa	honey I hear your pain but right now with the economy the way it is its hard to spend time with love ones.Men are very diffrrent especially when they become fathers they feel that work and money is more important for there status as a family man.What I mean is that fathers have more stress in their lives because they have to bring the douh to the table if you know what I mean.Back then in past decades the mother stayed at home and fed the kids while the father had to go hunt a bear to eat and stay alive.If your mother is fighting so much with your dad is probably do to stress over bills they have to pay in oder to live.If you need a friend in oder to find confort to deal with this or help from a outside source if you can't handle this it sound like you may need a sound board some one to listend to your pain hang in there kido and best luck to you:)
rAtO08x5aa	what you need to do right now is to think about your future and what you want to do with the rest of your life, boys are going to come to you whether you want them to or not. You are probably looking at your peers who already have a list of boys to choose from and there's none on your I'd say be grateful and here is why. Would you prefer <br>  a} have tons of BF at your finger tips and probably get hurt or even Aids before you really figure out what life really holds in store for you or <br>  B] Wait for the right guy to come along and you too live happily and build a great life together. <br>  You choose whether you would grind your  coffee or buy instant coffee. <br>  Wise up and have some patients.. life is short and its going nowhere fast.|`|K6XZ18uHaa	im in the saaaaaaaaaame situation!  at least there are guys that you KNOW liked you!  for me, i just thought some did but the last time i knew FOR A FACT that a guy liked me was the 3rd grade :(  plus now i go to an all girls school, dumb right?  anyways just try and get to know new guys through any extracurricular activities you do and maybe you could try to ask a guy out.|`|hsvgllTwaa	im in college and have never had a boyfriend.<br>  a lot of people havn't<br>  <br>  your still young.<br>  <br>  i didnt have my first kiss till year 11<br>  so to be honest i think you should stop worring about it, theres more important stuff in life, believe me|`|9jKh8gUbaa	awww, dont be soo un-confident , make them notice you more, but not over the top :)|`|ad1d6858e700016538725acfd13dfbf5aa	nothing is wrong with you at all! the thing about girls and boys your age is that girls tend to mature faster than guys do. therefore, while girls are thinking about love and boyfriends, most guys are only thinking about video games and food. There WILL be a boy in your grade who will mature, and then you will get noticed. You might just have to wait it out for a little bit|`|G2J5m25Vaa	Well maybe you just need to step up your game and get into like a new fashion and try something different than what your doing now. If one sees you any differently try talking to a guy. I am pretty sure you have a guyish friend. If you like a certin guy try to talk to him or something make sure that he really knows that your alive. I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|769Y7ITPaa	You are only in 9th grade!!!! Don't sweat it! Believe me, you will eventually be complaining that guys will not leave you alone. As for being shy, I'm sure that will change when you get older. Also, most guys are immature, and some are too afraid of you rejecting them.|`|W6ZBPsVSaa	well maybe if you see some guys liking you. then you should take the first step. try asking out instead of waiting. chances are you are gonna get atleast one date or more.|`|cd5529dada3441913c5b1fda0ca0eeb1aa	hang with your girls. don't worry about boys. flirt a little have fun in high school. have those boys come to you.|`|oQgX3YHgaa	don't worry its normal. i'm in the same position as you and feel the same way|`|DTMzD1N0aa	Ok hun<br>  <br>  Nothing is wrong with you :)<br>  <br>  and i know u prolly dont want the answer " dont be so shy"<br>  <br>  SO i wont give that answer :)<br>  <br>  Ok heres a fact- Most guys don't want a nice girl they want the one who puts out. And i know if ur an acual good person u wont be the the one that does the stuff.<br>  <br>  So maybe in the hallway smile at a guy- that doesnt take much courage and it will prolly make him feeel special :D cus just think what if a randome guy smiled at u, you would be glowing!<br>  <br>  and u were right to turn down that guy, who shouldnt date out of pity or anything- it should be true emotion.<br>  <br>  and trust me! People would notice!!!! U sound pretty and nice. So why wouldnt a guy like u?!?!? And if you wouldnt walk up to the guy u like and flirt, what makes u think a guy is any different??  <br>  <br>  were all afraid of one thing- REJECTION<br>  <br>  so one girl to another dont give up:)<br>  <br>  people care about you, they just havent gotten the courage to tell you!|`|KaF0nNFmaa	Well, first off, you obviously have low self-esteem if you are relying on opinions from strangers over the internet.

Do you talk to this girl? is she some sort of friend of yours? I would tell her as soon as yesterday. This girl is wasting her own time and you are stressed in the process, neither of which are good for either one of you. <br>  <br>  If you have no intention of sparing the feelings of this young girl, then by all means, blurt it out. If you would like to spare her feelings, perhaps tell her a certain boy is looking at her a certain way, perhaps tell her that he and she would look nice together? Lay it on thick with the friend roll and tell her that it is nice to have friends like her in your life. Are you dating anyone at the moment? If not, discuss a girl you have a crush on yourself. But at the end of the day, someway, somehow, let this child know you are not interested. There are many ways to achieve this. But I think you both deserve peace of mind. Good Luck to you.<br>  <br>  -Mae.|`|ix5Wmhy0aa	If you're uncomfortable with the attention she is giving you, then you should deffinately say something now. It's not fair on her if she thinks she stands a chance with you, and it's certainly not fair on you.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the best way to make her stop would be just to talk to her alone, and tell her exactly how you feel. Don't be too harsh though, she might have no idea that you aren't interested :(. <br>  <br>  If you don't say anything then it can only get worse for both of you, until the point when one of you will get hurt much worse than if you just deal with it now.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|XyrGLumFaa	Hiya!<br>  <br>  don't let her down striaght a way. just tell her in a nice way like. i think you r stalking me i think that should stop right now. oh by the way i don't like u. just find someone who is better, i am not worth it cos i already have a girlfriend. just lie to her, about the girlfriend thing, <br>  <br>  i hope that helps.|`|vUvcGRveaa	Well, go easy on her.

apbuHIJOaa	Yes and no; more yes than no.<br>  <br>  No - I say no because if he catches me looking, that also means I've caught him looking.<br>  <br>  Yes - Sometimes I feel awkward looking at a guy I like from a distance. I don't want him to think I'm creepy or anything. A lot of the time I simply look from the corner of my eye to see if he's looking and that's about it. I find I often have to convince myself to look at him, as the urge to look away is strong.<br>  <br>  If we're at a fair distance walking towards each other (which frequently seems to happen with guys I like), I'll look to the side. I rarely look down, directly at him, or behind him when we're approaching each other, even if I know he's looking back. When we come close to passing I MAY look at him, it just depends how confident I feel at the time.<br>  <br>  If you really want to know if this girl likes you, talk to her and see how she reacts when in conversation. When I talk to a guy I like I can't help but smile and blush. I assume you'll just get the feeling she's happy speaking with you. And, if she's shy, don't wait for her to talk to you first, you may be waiting a looong time!|`|cL34EiMWaa	I would say yes, but you should definitely strike up a conversation with her and see how she acts. Try getting her a little more comfortable with you. I don't want to be caught checking out a guy I think is cute... so yes, it's perfectly normal.|`|CDFz2Yjvaa	Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't<br>  Like with my crush sometimes I hold stares with him forever but other times I just move my head away right when I start to see his head move.<br>  I think my staring times depend on my mood|`|CCyB12Tbaa	Depends, if he is looking at me first I usually hold it for awhile, if he catches me looking I look away.|`|GS4IklLSaa	Yeah :)<br>  It's weird, I never look at the guys I like except from a distance. <br>  I usually look more at the guys that repulse me.<br>  Haha, good luck! <br>  Sounds like she's into you.|`|Kr9CowEXaa	All the time. It's more of a habit for me.|`|MhnwosUvaa	ya even though i dont say it, it happens all the time to me|`|qJECm9nFaa	shes waiting on you to make a move go for it|`|kznKVVQxaa	yes!!!!!! of course i do when i start to like someone i cant lok at is face only sometimes and then we stare for a long time but i end up looking away. she is probably shy or doesnt no what to say to you so start casually talking to her and it will amke her feel more comfortable|`|bM0pvOIkaa	maaake a move!!!<br>  <br>  Answer my question please!|`|piuEx0BJaa	yes im a shy girl and i try everything in my power to avoid looking at the guy i like haha sad but true. its up to you to make the move :)|`|6FKP1VwNaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to explain it...but I do it all the time.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	I do, and i am totally shy when it comes to guys i like. I'd stare at him until he looked at me and then i'd quickly look away until i thought that he wasn't looking again and then i'd glance and if he was looking at me then i would quickly look away and give a little smile or blush. You should say something to her.|`|1hcupwT4aa	YES.<br>  To your last question, simply, the answer is a total and complete yes.<br>  <br>  I get really nervous around guys I find attractive, I never want to make eye contact with them, if I see them looking at me the first thing I do is look behind them or down or turn completely away so they don't catch me looking back. It's wired into my brain or something.<br>  <br>  That's totally normal.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	YES, that's exactly what I do. Try talking to her, say hi one day and if she gets a huge uncontrollable smile then she's probabaly into you.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Hey I do that looking thing to when I think a guy is cute. I am trying to stop doing it though. But yes, if she tries to avoid looking at you and when you walk by she'll look at you then yes she may like you. I know that is what I do. <br>  <br>  Trust me, I am shy. My classmates in the past use to forget that I was even in class.<br>  <br>  And in my new Culinary school, my classmates call me Quiet "my name" or "Ms. Mouse." Why do you think my screen name is Chef Quiet. I am a chef, and I am quiet. You can break her out of it. Talk to her more, shy people do like the company of others and hate being quiet, but they don't know how to become a more outgoing person.

509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	you still have two years before going to college, worry about that when it happens.  I graduated with a PhD a year before my gf did, I ended up with a temporary position close to home.  Now my gf and I are about 200 miles apart, we see each other every other week.  When your relationship develops to the point where you both can trust each other, being apart for a little while is not a problem.  The truth is that she needs to think about it more than you do.  Assuming that you go to a particular college, she will have to get into the same college or a college that is close by.  She needs to work harder and makes sure to qualify for the colleges around you.|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Your thinking way to earlier,stop stressing and deal with it when that time comes around you still have 2 years|`|pC1H7kO4aa	First of all, you won't get into "clooege" with that kind of spelling lol<br>  And lastly, if you love each other you'll find a way!|`|xHq5jfNtaa	I'm from the United Kingdom and the schooling system is different here, but, if what other people are saying is correct, then you still have two more years left until you  go to college. That's plenty of time to make decisions regarding how you two are going to keep in contact. If you want to put your mind at rest, however, rest assured that there are plenty of ways to keep in contact over long distances. You can email your girlfriend, telephone her or even get webcams attached to your computers so that you can see each other whilst you chat. Colleges and universities are organised into terms or semesters with breaks in between each one. During these, you can visit your girlfriend or she can visit you. Don't worry, you will have a great time!|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Your sweet. but your not a senior yet. so dont worry about it.\<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me out?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222105721AAPNXkA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|r623CUuRaa	Don't overthink this. <br>  It's way too early to even tell if you two will be together.

Right at this moment she may be the girl that you think you are in love with or whatever, but opinions change. You or she might decide that you want to date other people. You still have 2 years until then. If you go until then, then you are really lucky and so is she and when that time comes, you will be so close, and if it is this relationship is something that you both really want to keep up even if you are in college far away, you will set it in your minds to find a way to work it out.<br>  So don't worry about it now. Just concentrate on your relationship with her right now.|`|C9QQPROkaa	If you really want to stay with her then you guys can make it work ask her to go to the same college as you or you g to a college with her.

Maybe you'll meet a nice guy soon!|`|1zfwLsQpaa	u should go out|`|FiCl71flaa	The simple answer is that you hurt his feelings bad. I suspect that he feels that after having known each other for so long and being close friends, that he could talk to you about things in his life especially good things. When  you asked him to stop talking to you about his girlfriend, he felt that you were no longer his friend, or not happy for him, or jealous at his new found happiness.What I suggest you do is to contact him ( call him if you can),  ask him why he is being abrupt with you, tell him you are sorry if you came across as uncaring or uninterested in his joy, reassure him that you are still his friend and want to remain so, and you are glad he has a girlfriend he likes so much.His response will let you known how he now feels and also allow you to know your next move. As an aside , since you indicated that a part of you still likes him, keep your ears open for clues that he might want to try for a romance with you since I am thinking he might also be thinking that you are jealous because you guys almost hooked up together;he may be a little confused about his own feelings for you too.|`|OzBHZ64jaa	maybe you could try leaving him alone for a while. he might think you're coming on too strong or something. then, after about a week you could try talking to him, and ask him questions that he can't answer either "hey, yeah, lol, or lamo" to.<br>  if he still doesn't talk to you, you could try talking to him about what you did wrong. just tell him how you feel.<br>  hope that helps!<br>  :]|`|vcwIyutxaa	Try to explain to him what you meant the day you said that and tell him you didn't mean it in a bad way, and if you havn't told him already, now would be a good time to tell him you like him, then he'll understand, good luck!|`|SQe4ghfdaa	Ask to speak to him alone at school and apologize. Tell him that you didn't mean it the way he thinks and that you feel hurt that he gave you the silent treatment. And say you don't want to lose him as a friend.|`|ym6pyUfIaa	Just ask him what you did wrong. If hes worth it, he'll give you a reasonable answer.|`|D97DeLY5aa	Whoa|`|D4C8Uxenaa	move on|`|4AKiarekaa	ok.. so you still like him and ur trying to move on?..<br>  well umm why dnt u just tell him what you meant and how u feel.. its going to be awkward but u never kno he might like u more than the other chik so have faith and tell him ( lol i dnt mean me =P) but yea hehe just tell him how you feel and why you said what you said.. im sure he'll understand|`|mXTn7fGRaa	if he likes someone else then he likes someone else. real talk. if u complain about little things like the things he feels comfortable telling u, like about this girl, and u tell him to stop, dont expect for him to open up or tell u anything else... he needed u to just be a friend, its not all about u... we should all really learn to just listen. u wont lose him tho if he's really ur friend.. but this is jus life.. people come in and out for reasons... dont be blind by the seasons okay??! best of luck!! =)|`|lLdhAHPlaa	this happened to me one time with a guy so i just went on with my life even though it bugged me i didn't let it control my life. don't try to talk to him even if you want to really bad because after i just let go and did my own thing he started talking to me after like i guess it was 4 to 5 months and we are best friends again but it only happened after he and his girlfriend broke up so yeah sorry if this doesn't help but i hope it does|`|qSbDZgQlaa	well ive never been in a situation like this but I think that you should just invite him out for some pizza and talk to him about it or something. I know itll probably be awkward and weird but i think that you need to ask him straight up if he still likes you. That way you dont have to keep waiting for him. I think you should just move on first and see what happens. I am a sophomore right now and from the beginning of 8th grade to the beginning of freshman year i had a really big crush on this one guy. Me and him were good friends but i didnt think he liked me. It turns out he did but never told me and there were never really any signs either. But what i am trying to get at is that i am at the end of my sopomore year and i have had a boyfriend(not the one i liked) since freshman year. I still really liked that other guy but i knew i had to move on and i did and i LOVE who i am with now. good luck:)
NGz7R9enaa	Tell him that you feel like getting naughty.
ix5Wmhy0aa	Wow, you're stunning ^_^<br>  <br>  What you think is a big hint might not be so obvious to them, and maybe they think you're joking when you say about kissing them.<br>  <br>  Once you've talked to them, maybe it would be better just to ask them to do something with you, rather than just hinting. You seem really nice, so I don't see why they would say no.<br>  <br>  Plus, they are probably quite shy, but you sound quite confident. Even if they want to, they probably aren't sure enough of themselves to do anything about it.<br>  <br>  If you just ask them to do stuff, then i'm sure you won't be single for long. <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|Z8WGDv5paa	cuz boys suck. they like games especially if they aren't into you all that much.

XT81GCu1aa	It seems like he was being a little harsh, but likely his feelings were hurt (no it wasn't your fault or intention, but he was probably hurt.)  I don't think an apology is necessary on your part, but I would be the person to reach out.  Let him know that you really appreciate what he did and how sweet it was.  You just couldn't get away at the time.  If he still is mean and acting babyish tho, I'd just pull back a little.  Again, you should reach out but then if he's not reasonable, what else and you do?  At least you know you tried, though.|`|ywZ49zCQaa	He should apologize. He should know that its basically impossible for any girl to be ready in a half hour.

Couples often times ruin their chances at joy by blowing little things like this completely out of the water. I think both of you should realize that this was stupid and just kiss and make up. It sounds like you really like the guy, so don't be so mad just go to him and calmly state your feelings. If he goes off, well, then we see we have problems, otherwise you are in the clear.|`|IVcxIDXZaa	he should say sorry but i would atleast have tried to get ready as much as possible. but he was in the wrong.<br>  try mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222172041AAJ3QAo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|QQlbvWj4aa	As much as it sounds nice to have a guy do something spontaneous like that, most girls just can't switch gears that quickly... you might as well both apologize.

j5rHgDSkaa	I am so sorry to hear that you feel like this. The fact that you know you need to love yourself more shows that you are a smart and mature girl, and that is always respected. I used to be an anerexic so I know exactly how this feels. The truth is, by not loving yourself, you make others unable to love you. So love yourself because theres nobody else on this earth like you. Secondly you don't have to know who you are to love yourself. You may just be that crazy fun girl who doesn't have a plan, but loves life anyways.

My biggest advice for finding out who you are is as easy as this:<br>  <br>  TURN OFF YOUR TELEVISION AND DON'T TURN IT BACK ON!<br>  <br>  With your time you have left during the day (after your homework), start reading.<br>  <br>  Reading stuff that you don't have to, helps develop your likes and dislikes and helps you discover who you are.  TV distorts your world view and fills your head with garbage.  Detox yourself from tv.  It'll take about 1 month, and see how much clearer your head is.  You can still rent a movie, but do not just sit in front of the tv and veg-out.<br>  <br>  Since you are in economics (I love economics, btw) and business I will suggest some of my favorite books (maybe you'll develop the passion I have for it!  The problem with college is they fill your head with Keynesian economic theory and Austrian economics is really where it's at! ; )<br>  <br>  Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlett<br>  America's Great Depression by Murray Rothbard<br>  Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin<br>  <br>  Read, read, read...You'll soon discover who you are and you will love yourself and so will everyone who is worth your time.<br>  <br>  I am certain you will find yourself, everyone goes through this, but, you will be one of the ones that ACTUALLY discovers who you are.  Reading is the answer.<br>  <br>  I have been clean from tv for 1 year!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	well Iam 40, we have ideals what or who we want to be but nothing is set in stone, life changes as time goes on, you want one thing and then a day later you didn't want that at all. you are right you have to find yourself, what you like and what makes you happy, before you can be with anyone. you want to be able to be yourself and not change for anyone. just have to look hard at yourself find that place that your comfortable with and stay with that. But don't start a relationship until you find yourself, because you will be miserable if you do.|`|Ncad6d57aa	I kind of feeel the same way, except I'm goingthrough a divorce and have a baby. But anyways, it's good that you realize that. Try doing things you like to do and find others who share similar interests. Take up hobbies and such. But it's okay to not necessarily know who you are at this point in life, everyone goes through it. And ppl change their majors several times before they actually graduate so don't worry about that. Join some clubs or something at your college and try to meet new people and as you develop and lose friendships/relationships, you learn who you are, what you like/or don't like, etc. Everythng just takes time.|`|1bvXwMfIaa	You answered your own question!  It,s very difficult to love someone else if you don't love/like yourself first! Don,t be so hard on yourself. In all honesty,I felt the same way when I was 21.

Not very close friends, because it's impossible.  But one of them did manage to grow up, and is now a much closer friend as a result.  She got over this self-obsessed psychosis you describe.<br>  <br>  The fact that you mentioned "finding yourself" and "figuring out who you are" so many times bugs me.  People seeking themselves is just narcissistic baloney!<br>  <br>  Who you are can be summarized, in its basic form, as just a list of your likes and dislikes, habits, and interests.  Me?  I like sleep, social psychology, eating chicken, music, teaching, questioning beliefs, and developing short-lived passions for new hobbies.  No, I don't know for certain where I will be or what I will be doing five years from now, but that doesn't mean I don't know who I am.  Even if you have questions about your goals or beliefs, that's a PART of who you are.  Addition, not subtraction.  Examples:<br>  <br>  Your bogus equation is "Think I'm a good person" Minus "Don't know my passions" Equals "Zero."  That's dumb.<br>  <br>  It should be "Think I'm a good person" PLUS "Still exploring the world and my options" Equals "I'm a pretty interesting person."<br>  <br>  Either way, it's ironic to me that you think you can't love yourself.  You are clearly OBSESSED with yourself.  No wonder you haven't had a serious relationship.  Relationships require you to devote some time to the OTHER person, and with your current narcissism, I'm not sure you would be able to do that.
GHZnLiYvaa	Yes, the best way to sort this out is to talk it out with him. Who knows, if still has the same feelings for you and wants to get back together, probably that's the reason he is asking you out! So go ahead and tell him the truth. Any man would appreciate it and if he really likes you, he would feel honored to have you and the happiest person on earth! At the same time, if you two could go a long way together, and become one, you really need to give it a try and talk it out with him. Good luck! :)|`|Pl9lY7qCaa	Why not?

RElSzZtyaa	Hey Steph-<br>  Good question! I would say there has to be a healthy balance between the two. However, that is hard to come by... let me give you some insight on what i have learned from relationships I have been in. <br>  At first there almost always has to be a physical attraction between two people in order for them to date.  This isn't a bad thing... you are supposed to be attracted to someone that you are in a relationship with because you are supposed to be intimate with them.  However, I have met a countless number of beautiful women that I will never date, simply because their personality makes them less attractive. <br>  <br>  It is sometimes hard to start a relationship with someone that you aren't completely attracted to. However, this can change over time. I have been in relationships where i started a really strong "personal" relationship with someone, and eventually a strong physical attraction developed. The best relationships i have been in have developed this way.<br>  <br>  The important thing to remember Steph, is that you will want to date someone who is looking for the same qualities that you are. If you are looking for someone with a great personality, chances are one of the personal qualities that the person will have is that he or she is looking for someone with a personality that matches his.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything... and remember... relationships and dating is all trial and error... 99.9% of successful couples have been in unsuccessful relationships in the past.|`|uu6ivaYUaa	I know this girl who doesn't look so bad.

I hate this question, but it's a good one. I think it is a question of timing. Good looks will definitely win out in achieving interest. But bad personality definitely wins out in losing interest.<br>  <br>  So...I guess I would "pick" a good looking woman over an nice personality. But after (and however) the interest as been garnered, I would reject a bad personality before an unattractive woman. You just can't be around a B*tch, but you can definitely learn to find a women with a good personality to be attractive.|`|kFHwzBG7aa	Why can't she just have both?

It's an opportunity to clear the air a bit, I mean it's an occasion, not as if you're just texting out of the blue. <br>  <br>  Over the weekend I got an email from a guy I dated for a few weeks and lost touch with. I didn't find it weird, it was nice hearing from him so maybe this guy will feel the same about hearing from you. <br>  <br>  It's better to regret the things you have done than the things you haven't, so if nothing comes of it at least you made an effort to try to fix it.<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you choose to do.

Either way, it just sounds like the guy doesn't really know what he wants and still enjoys being single and chasing after pretty girls. Some guys are just like that. They don't like the thought of being tied down to just one person when there are so many fish in the sea. When I think of a player, the guy chases after a girl he wants, uses her for what he wants, and acts like he cares about her to keep her around for how ever long he wants while he is chasing after other girls. It doesn't sound like player material to me. Just a guy who likes to pursue very attractive girls.|`|3N5onOZraa	Has he ever been married?  What's his longest relationship?

Wy0lUjP9aa	You can't force a guy to like you. If you act like yourself and have confidence. Then if he doesn't like you still or you don't notice him staring at you and smiling at you, then that guy is interested. Are you crushing on a guy or are you trying to at least get attention from any cute guy where at least you feel that you are attractive? Well it is confidence, like saying hello to the guy. Don't try to avoid looking at him, look at him and then when he looks, look away. This lets him know you are interested at least. Then body language is another plus. Don't fold your arms when you are around, chew gum, and standing a certain way as well.|`|lIx6kngbaa	You cant get a guy to like you but you can be yourself. Have lots of confidence guys love a confident women with a great personality.
mcUSz16kaa	Here are my thoughts- First I  would definitely feel guilty if I ever cheated because I would care enough about my relationship & my s/o that it would matter to me.  However, I know people who have cheated and they don't feel guilty at all because they just don't care about their relationship and s/o anymore. Bottom line (they don't care.) Therefore, If they don't care ..they won't feel guilty or have any remorse. However, if they ever get caught, I'm sure they will feel a some guilt, but it would be the act of being caught that they would feel guilty about.<br>  <br>  One of many reasons they cheat is they aren't "In love" with their s/o anymore, and they are not satisfied with what they have now.  They see their relationship fizzling out and dying if it hasn't already died. Even though they feel love for their husband, wife, g/f or b/f., it's not the same deep intimate love that it used to be. The love (that you mentioned) that they are feeling is probably the same love that you may have for your sisters and  brothers, family and so on.  If these people were truly happy and "In Love" and were full filled emotionally, physically and mentally,  they would have no reason to cheat and won't be looking else where to full fill their emptiness.|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	women are mens play things.|`|VyU2d8Ohaa	if i'm in a relationship and a man make me mad enough (feelings or no feelings)  i will see/go out with male friends (don't necessarly have to sex) and won't feel nothing.|`|39SPqvhyaa	if you really loved your spouse you wouldn't cheat at all. but, there are those who do at least once. im sure there is a small amount of guilt in everyone who cheats but some learn from their mistakes where some don't. the sad part about it is, the innocent ones always gets hurt. we can blame a lot of it on alcohol, drugs and hanging out with the wrong people. but it also depends on whether or not you can ever trust this person again.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I think those people have strange ideas about what it means to love someone. I feel very sorry for the other person in the relationship, and honestly I think they should move on so that they can experience the love they deserve from someone else.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Well, to me, a person like that has no conscious or is really selfish.  I have cheated once or twice, wasn't married to them, but was dating these peeps and I felt reallly bad.  I hate guilt.  It's ALMOST as bad as gettin cheated on, for me.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	I'm sorry I am not remorseful.|`|Xfx9KBwIaa	Many people have made good points here but there is another side to it that no one has mentioned. Whether you agree with the moral implications of it or not, there are people out there who do believe that love and sex are separate. Some people equate sex with a cup of coffee or more specifically a bodily function. They see it as an animal instinct that they have the right, as animals, to fulfill. This to them has no impact on their love for their partner and does not nessisarily mean that they have bad sex with their partner.<br>  <br>  We live in a society where our sexual behaviours are determined by our culture or religion. Most cultures believe practice monogamy and almost all religions preach monogamy on pain of eternal damnation, however it cannot be denied that some people are just different and cannot act within these cultural boundaries. Call it ungodly or unfair but some people are not built for monogamy and do not make a nessisary connection between love and sex.<br>  <br>  Fortunately some couples are open about this fact and can come to an agreement, but if two people in a pairing do not share the same beliets about this then it's not fair in EITHER of them to continue a monogamous relationship.|`|jlbMKE1vaa	i dont beleive in cheating. however, i am here to answer your question. i HAVE cheated, in a relationship, i would never do it again and deffinitly not to a long trm partner. this guy didnt not show he cared very much.. he went on holiday and said 'you can hook up with people if you want' meaning 'i can hook up with people if i want to' qnd so i slept with a guy i worked with because he was very into me and we were great friends. although i wish i never did it. this is why<br>  <br>  cheating is plain disrespect|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	for the guy who talks crap on his wife. your an A$$HOLE!!

fL8QIhfyaa	don't change, why would you want to? I know some women probably don't appreciate you take advantage because you are TOO nice but in the end you need to stay true to who you are and you'll meet an amazing girl because of it. Someone that appreciate everything you do for her. I think letting someone change you and how you view relationships makes you weak, don't let them have that impact on you. :)<br>  Plus nice guys are hard to come by now a days so don't take another one away from us!<br>  <br>  wow, i don't think you are nice at all haha you are ranting and raving about way more deeper issues ..you need to see someone because you are just bitter and maybe have issues with women.

BLaEQfdDaa	for me and my wife, we were married for 5 years, no kids, through out the year, things got tough for us, she couldn't work because of medical issues, that was fine, but the bill, mortgage, just life kicked, I became distant, got mad really easy, over a time, I didn't know what I was doing to her and us, She just told me one day that she had falling out of love with me, that I slowly pushing her away, She couldn't talk to me anymore. This has really hurt her really bad to the point we don't talk anymore, Iam just waiting for the divorce papers to come in the mail. She said tried to talk but I wouldn't listen, She felt like I didn't want her anymore, not the case I love her with all my heart, but as men we forget how to treat someone with respect and being there, no matter what and mainly just be there to listen. just sometimes things get in the way. she said it would take time to forgive me for hurting her, she didnt want to feel this way but I didnt make things easy for her, IF you can get back what you both had, then its best to move on, It hurts alot knowing what I have done to her and to us, but I want her to be happy even if its without me now. you have to take care of yourself. cant pretend things are ok when they arent doesnt do either one of you any good. I wish you luck|`|924d3783b5ac5e06329d0bedc1d478e4aa	you never really know someone until you live with them, learn thier ways, if it is really "until death do us part"  then work it out.  you can't change him/her anymore  than you can change her/him.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	People change over time...so do relationships. Nothing stays the same. I also think that marriage is a serious thing, and it shouldn't be taken lightly. However, in cases of abuse - any kind of abuse- I do believe it's better to end it.<br>  <br>  If you don't love him anymore, and you feel that he put you through a lot of things you can neither forgive nor forget, then I'd suggest you get a divorce. Do what is best for you and your daughter.<br>  <br>  Kids are smarter than we give them credit for. And I'm sure your daughter must sense you are not happy.<br>  <br>   Since you are setting up an example of how a marriage should be like, if you are miserable in yours you are teaching her that it is OK to live like this...and chances are she will choose an abusive man as a husband later on.<br>  <br>  Think about it. Good luck. Ask God to guide you and heal you.|`|mCM363I9aa	all I see is that you have wasted 10yrs of each others life, first of all your ex is your ex for a reason & it's time to let go and move on.<br>  If your husband has changed his abusive ways is because he either wants to stay married to you or because he is also doing it for his child. Either way he has changed and you should make some changes for the better also.

But if you were to come to her and say that you're 100% sure you want to try to work things out and you still love your husband in your heart she might be more supportive. <br>  You are scared of her cause you are worried he might be pissed and kick you out. Well she might. But I'm sure you can manage cause you're an adult.

o3d3NBVzaa	Here's the deal dude:<br>  <br>  You are bringing her down with your self-loathing. Since you don't get to see each other all that often, she's probably getting annoyed because you talk bad about yourself whenever you spend time together. She probably wants to have fun with you, not feel sorry for you.<br>  <br>  Try being more upbeat, and more positive.|`|0YS37jqgaa	I only skimmed the first paragraph..<br>  <br>  Uh, be confident.<br>  She doesn't want to date a guy who thinks of himself as a loser.<br>  You can be positive about yourself without bragging, so cheer up!

The bacterium Streptococcus mutans is a cause of tooth decay and is often passed from parents to their kids through kissing, sharing straws and other activities where contact with saliva is made.<br>  <br>  Kids are most susceptible to catching the cavity-causing bacteria when they're between six and 36 months of age.

Ncad6d57aa	Those internet things are scams don't do it. If the divorce isn't contested (ex: no arguments over property, custody, alimony, etc) you have to file a complaint at the court house and you still usually have to go in front of a judge and just say why. But some states there's a waiting period for an absolute divorce and you must live separate for x amount of years. You can't just get divorced instantly. Just go to your local court house (usually circuit court handles this), ask the law clerks and they will instruct you.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	Iam going through a divorce right now, if you two have agree on things like spliting of the billing, property, ect, then just one has to go to court and file papers work, you have to go to court house to do this becasue you have to pay the filing fee which is around $250-350 depend on what you both have. Just file out the paperwork and mark the boxes thats it. good luck|`|AA10700077	Yes, one of you will need to go to court and sit on the stand.

u6TQvI8Caa	Yeah. But I figured if he didn't do it by the second time he told me he was going to, I pretty much knew he had no plans to in the first place. My reaction was the same as all the other times I knew I was being used for sex. Which was nine out of ten times but I knew someday a great guy who was honest and loyal would come along.  Putting up with lies and betrayal was just a means to an end. Fortunately I finally found a good one! I didn't want to keep hitting myself in the head and wondering why I had a headache...|`|0H43RTmpaa	God no. I would never get in the type of situation in which that would be an option.

How stupid to get with someone you KNOW is capable of such behavior?
2Fi3EmI8aa	Be really carefull about what you say, as the guy above me said it is very possibly that what you think of as a lovely gesture could be mistaken for a bit creepy or even insincere.  It would be much better to tell her in person if you can.  <br>  <br>  If you want - feel free to email what you want to write and i'll let you know.  Just be careful about what you saty and don't be too specific.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Just buy a flower, and have a little card with it, and in it you write, "I just wanted you to know how beautiful you are."

f1gmEmUTaa	It sounds like your brother is being protective of you. Which is what he should be doing. Look at it from his perspective. He probably knows this guy a lot better than you do and doesn't feel comfortable letting the two of you get romantically entangled. I mean, I have friends that I would trust with my bank account numbers, but I damn sure wouldn't let them hook up with my sister.  Take it for what it's worth, but I think you have a damn good brother.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	If he doesn't know he strongly suspects.  Maybe the guy is bragging?  My guess is that your brother is looking out for you and actually being discreet about it.  Lucky girl to have a bro like that.  If you want to make an issue of it, ask your brother.  But my guess is that he knows the guy better than you and is doing you a huge favor.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Tell your brother to mind his business. What you want to do is your priority and not his. Then go do whatever you want with that other guy.|`|qeQVyLW7aa	from what you're saying it sounds like he knows what is going on or something else.

KYU2Yl8Waa	The best thing you could do for her is stick up for her, tell the guy ''hey, she broke up with you, get over it! Being a jerk isn't going to change anything! I can see why she broke up with you you self-centered basterd!! LEAVE HER ALONE!!!" And tell your friend just to snub him, because giving him attetion for it is just what he wants and he doesn't deserve her attention. Tell her not to read into anything he's saying, tell her he's only saying those things out of anger, and that she's not the slightest bit fat. Just be supportive to her and stick up for her.

If he says she is fat i would say "yeah so" he is just being ignorant.. tell her to try and not let it get to her! he will stop cause he realizes she doesnt care|`|LAyigK5Aaa	I think the next time he does something like that you should do it back, or if you have a conscience you could tell a teacher. Another option would be to have your friend sit the dude down and tell him how she feels. Hope I helped! GOOD LUCK! :)|`|I1qIoAmsaa	Confront her and convince her to tell someone reliable. A parental guardian, family member, or even the principle if this is taking place in school.|`|W380tuKiaa	Slap him in the face in a very public place and say at the top of her voice "I thought all gay men nice but I guess I was wrong because your not!!!!"   that should fix his A**|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	Beef|`|GJb2OSrnaa	do be around him<br>  <br>  hes a D!ck  WTF, why deal with him, really just knock his @$$ out|`|goe3y4FPaa	IF U WERE MY LADY.. I WOULD KICK HIS TEETH OUT.. TELL UR FRIEND.. SHE HAS AN A**HOLE FOR A B.F.. AND TELL HER U WANT HER TO GET SOMETHING BETTER..|`|Dn1wcJlqaa	Okay, I have a few solutions, and they may or may not work. I hope at least one of them help you and your friend (and her ex, i guess :))<br>  <br>  1) Tell everyone to try and ignore him. Anything he does, just pretend like he's not there. Make sure when you ignore him, though, that you have a happy face on and are talking amongst yourselves, because other wise he will know it is getting to you. That is a good way to get him to stop because once he realizes what he's doing isn't annoying her or her friends, why bother? This may take a while, though.<br>  <br>  2) He's doing this because he is immature. Try having her talk to him. Not telling him to stop, because that will just urge him to keep going, but just ask what is bothering him and say that she still wants to be friends, it was nothing personal, explain her reasoning, etc. This might not work.<br>  <br>  3) This may not work either, but i guess these are all worth a shot, right? Okay, so when he does something like that, either everyone get really involved and laugh with him, saying things like, "Oh my gosh that's such a funny picture, don't you think ______ (her name)" and "you are so funny, you should get into pro. drawing classes!" Or you could take it and be like , "Oh, thankyou! That was really nice of you to draw me a picture!"<br>  <br>  I hope these either help you or give you an idea to find another solution :)|`|EQtkV6YCaa	You should tell him to stop. Failing that, I would just diss him back. I bet the only reason that he's doing that is because he's upset about being dumped. He needs to learn that everyone is dumped once and a while. Just tell him to stop, or diss him back. :)  Hope I helped!|`|T0wS6h0aaa	Attack back, make rude comments about him like drawing pictures with a stick coming out of his pants or kick him in the nuts, always works <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Try to calm this person down. Ask his friends to tell him to stop and if that doesn't work tell his parents xD|`|KrFQ1gcraa	He's obviously upset and immature<br>  He liked her a lot<br>  Though he'll get over it in time, i think she should stand up to him and be like "alright, i know you're upset i don't want to date you, but be mature about it."|`|igj6p3Zzaa	embarass him back (but rlly meanily like he did to her) tell him you pity him (he'll hate that) because hes so upset over her dumping him. tell your friend to ignore him (it IS possible you kno) and tell him to stop and show him u rlly mean and express your anger dont yell but be stern|`|QbD4J8GCaa	Tell this guy to back off and tell him he is acting like a desperate child ! If things get any worse you should do as the 2nd graders do and ignore him maybe he will get the picture that major loser !|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	he's just mad he got dump.

You are right she dose not need to be treated that way. If he sill bugs her get a teacher. Yes you might get called a snitch but it is worth it for a friend.

You need to be there so she <br>  has someone to be there for her. And tell him who you feel<br>  about it. Cause it aint right for him to act like that.<br>  So you need to tell him off. If that dont work then Talk to <br>  someone about it|`|xdncqMxPaa	Fore me, id use revenge.But i ur nice, id ignore it and when ever someone brings it up just change that subject. Act as i it doesn't affect you, and eventually he will realize that no one cares, and he will stop.<br>  hope my advice helps ya.|`|PAS2ZgM2aa	KICK HIS ***** ***....AND EMBARRASS HIM BACK BY TELLING EVERYONE ALL THE EMBARRASSING THINGS HE'S EVER DONE THAT SHE KNOW ABOUT....|`|ZU5y3OVVaa	Although I don't know them I apologise for the rude and insensitive answers preceding this one. This can be very upsetting coming from someone who says they cared for you. He is a very silly boy who can't handle rejection. <br>  <br>  At 14 having large breasts can be an embarrassment and some idiot doing this sort of stuff is very emotionally draining. Is he doing it in school? If he is does your school have an anti-bullying policy? Use the policy and talk to your year head. <br>  <br>  Remember thought, this is his problem not your friends. He is obviously immature and suffering with a very bruised ego.|`|nQZEJz5yaa	OMG THATS SOO MEAN!!! OMG OMG OMG... i would have never dated a guy like that if i knew that he would do that... though she didnt know. you guys should get a group of people that all care and stand up to him! or tell someone! she might be even more embarrassed telling somone but im sure that after at the end it will be worth it!

I'm tired of hearing these stupid questions, when the very girls who ask will ALWAYS avoid the best guys.|`|kDyj5d7laa	As you said feel confident. Get his number, try to hang out with him.

Guys like that. lol|`|G0U2ExOSaa	little tip: don't he won't be your friend if he don't feel the same way|`|Wv592rOqaa	You really think having a new outfit and new makeup is all you need to feel confident?  <br>  <br>  He might not want date you because he has too much respect for you as you already said he has been through a few girlfriends already - I mean think about it?  - A person's behavior with other people is usually the truth about who they are.  <br>  <br>  However, if you insist in moving beyond friendship with him - then why not just tell him that you like him - after all you said he is your friend and friends should be able to talk about things that other people cannot talk about - that is why we call them friends.  <br>  <br>  Being confident is way beyond makeup and clothes and feeling good about yourself emotionally and giving yourself the best of what you want - a senior might be too mature for you at this time - and it won't mean there is anything wrong with you - except this guy has respect enough for you to keep the relationship as friends rather than lovers.  In a short time he will be off to college - and you will still be in high school - as time passes if this is the guy for you - believe me you will see him in the future.|`|ek1193Qiaa	talk about yourself and wear some good perfume...that usually gets his attention pretty quick<br>  <br>  just be yourself....if he likes you now the friendly relationship should build up into something more|`|KrFQ1gcraa	well you cant make him like you<br>  but id say just be yourself.<br>  you're already good friends so try not to do anything thatll ruin that<br>  <br>  in time you may be able to make the first move if he doesnt|`|SrgKPAGUaa	umm play with his hair i like my hair played with...hahaha doing it too myself now hahaha wow this rocks hahaha|`|4pKIllAeaa	ask him out<br>  i am sure he will be so happy when he finds out u like him|`|e4855c591b7d8a2e94e9240208e24e9eaa	Ask him:<br>  <br>  "With the state of the economy... what say you and I bailout of here?"|`|tUxseGO0aa	just ask him out go for the chance|`|zFwjZy53aa	grow up|`|qSbDZgQlaa	you just need to be you. new outfits and makeup isnt nessicarily going to make him like you.

The best thing is to just ask him straight up. Then that takes away all the assuming and guessing.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Spontaneously kiss him when you're hanging out with him.

Kqsbbc0faa	i can relate to your relationship status, me and my boyfriend arent married, and not been 2gether that long but im already getting the abuse. mentally, emotionally, not physically yet, but its been close. ive been called every name in the book...and we aregue over the most stupidest shyt in the world...he called me a bytch last night and i went off on him becuase he got mad that i had an attitude that he called me that, and he expects me to brush it off like nothing happened?..idk..but.. i dont wanna break up with him, even though it could get worse, or he could cheat (if he hasnt already).. i dont wanna loose him. im attached, and at times, i dont think he loves me like he says he does.. i feel like he hates me and that he takes all his anger out on me. but u rely on ur husband to be there, and make you feel important, and u want someone to love and want you, like you do them.. and as much crap as you put up with, you still love him, and when he leaves and comes back, u want him to come back, its like u feel like you need him, and when hes gone, you wonder what he is doing or who he is with...to you it seems like he doesnt care, but at other times he does...its a big emotional rollercoaster, cuz wen ur pissed off and mad at them, they can turn it around real fast and make u weak, and make u feel like u need them..basically manilipulate you. <br>  honestly, i really dont know what to tell you to do..try and talk to him..see how he feels (if he will express it)<br>  but remember, you cant change someone who doesnt want to change theirselves... <br>  u see other couples and they are happy, and u ask "why cant you be treated like that"<br>  i can go on, but thats alot of typing..<br>  :) dont worry, you arent the only one who is going through this kinda stuff..and im half ur age..|`|wy25UY33aa	leave him if he doesn't express his love to you he is no worth it <br>  <br>  unless you have young children don't leave him he could be an abusive father<br>  <br>  <br>  GL|`|d8MvSJr4aa	did he really died tonight?|`|5YEKmHqyaa	I am so sorry for what you've had to go thru and honestly NO woman or let alone anyone should have to feel like that.  He has disprespected you in more ways than one.  I know right now you feel as though you can't make it without him whether it'd be financially or emotionally but you can get thru that.<br>  <br>  Be strong, for yourself and for your kids.  They need you.  You can't take this kind of abuse any more.  Physical, mental, emotional, its all draining you and you deserve to be happy.  I would say file for divorce, but i've never honestly been in your situation.<br>  <br>  You have to do what will make you happy.  You shouldn't be miserable everyday.  I know he may show sometimes that he cares, but sometimes isn't good enough.  All the things he has done, and doesn't show that he wants to make it up to you.  Excuse my french but **** him!!!  You are a wonderful woman and deserve way better and I think you should give yourself that opportunity..for you and your kids.|`|2KC467tFaa	I'm sorry to hear everything you've been through and everything you're going through. You do have strength. Otherwise you would've never made it this far. My mother had 3 kids and was married to a verbally abusive alcoholic. She didn't have a college education and was 2 states away from her home town. She didn't have any friends or family she could count on. She wanted to make sure we wouldn't grow up in that environment. To this day, I don't know how she did it, but she went to college and earned a nursing degree. She separated and later divorced my father. By succeeding in earning that degree, her confidence and self-esteem drastically improved. She became independent and finished raising us. You deserve better than that. You need to feel loved. Start by loving yourself and focusing on everything you've accomplished. Start setting small goals to boost your self-esteem. Once you know you can succeed on your own as an independent woman, you will be able to. You will find ways to support yourself. The only thing is that you can't doubt yourself. It's never too late to be happy in your life. My mother (now 50) recently met the man of her dreams. He's kind, respectful, considerate, and absolutely perfect for her. She would have never known such happiness if she would have accepted and settled for what position she was in when she was still married to my father. You have the power. As far as you kids, find a therapist to help them (and you) if you feel the need. If they are old enough to understand happiness, they will be fine knowing that you are ok and happy. You could also contact a women's center for advice or assistance. I do wish you the best. I wish I could help more.
vYAgIMLdaa	make up, wake up, grow up, not necessarily in that order|`|q8wfGBQdaa	Say sorry.|`|rPvQQzp4aa	that is the one of the stupidest fights ive heard. i agree with you that he shouldnt go around bragging but sometimes thats a good thing. as long as when he is with he doesnt brag and he just pays attention to you and no one else around you shouldnt be fighting. you sound like your embaressed by him when you fight with him about him telling people almost like you dont want people to know your with him maybe because you are embaressed but other people including him wont know thats not the case. just go with the flow.|`|M1RpWttdaa	why don't you ask him ANOTHER time why did he do that? and then, tell him "uh, ok, don't worry" or somethin lik that (:
tG0swCe6aa	Yes.  I've been in a long distance relationship for over a year.  However its less that a 4 hour distance.  Communication and trust is key.|`|AnImYu4Haa	i've been with my boyfriend for six years and two of those were spent with us living 5 hours apart. I know it wasnt as long distance as yours, but we still hardly ever saw each other. We called each other, and wrote letters, and text all the time. We're still together, so if a relationship is strong enough it will last!|`|475ca662f051679937b7c94c642a9d64aa	Good communication is vital in any relationship to keep the trust and loyalty there, I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years and she lives a bit further, Australia of all places, but me and her chat to each other via messenger when we can, and if not via email, and sometimes we leave it a couple of days so that we have more to talk about when we chat on messenger. But to me the most crucial part in a long distance relationship is meeting the person, and hopefully I'll get to meet her, because she is wonderful and hopefully you and Elvira will meet aswell and hope it works out for you.|`|AA12316360	I maintained one for two years, though we were able to see each other much nmore often, but the only communications we had back then were postal and the phone, the phone was expensive.  Ultimately, it didn't last, but there was an age gap of 20 years and it was an unhealthy relationship anyway, there was little trust and in the end it ended.  I know people who have successfullly conducted long distance relationships with far less connectivity than you and Elvira have, basically phone and post and that was pretty much it.  They have kept it going for some time, and have managed to ultimately be together.  My aunt married a guy from San Francisco about four years ago, they had a long distance relationship, met on the web, like you, and only saw each other twice before he proposed, and they are soooooo happy.  They live here now, but his application for a visa and then citizenship and right to abode have taken forever, despite an obvious marriage, a house together, savings and a life being moved to the UK, but they are happy, in love and together.  there is no reason why it should not work.
BNCpLcLoaa	because he's a twat.<br>  Don't let it bother you, just let the people around you know whats going on so they don't believe the shite he comes out with.|`|LHG0iBIiaa	Hi girl, i can say your ex already have a woman. He just waiting the right time to tell the lie. He never tell you before is he wasn,t sure how can he work out with his new-girl. As the time goes on, him and his new-lover getting stronger, so, he decide to dump you by telling lies. Cos, it is the only way makes him not feeling guilty in the public. But, actually, he is a f**king ****. He will see same thing will happen to him later. Cos, God is seeing everyone for what they are doing. Hey, you should celebrit your freedom from this kind of person. It is a good lesson for you, girl. I am very sad for you.I will always support you. Cos, this thing happen to me too. I was nearly die. She is a white girl. I am from Asian. It doesn,t mean she can cheat on me. I was very stupid. She lie to me until few months after i find out the truth. . . Anyway,you deserve a better one.Good luck in the future.
8FbOtXAXaa	I think that it is okay for your mothers to meet. I think your mom just wants to get to know his mom and judge for herself what kind of people they are. She just wants to make sure that you are in safe hands. It's not big deal. It's not like you two are planning on getting married or something and now its time for the parents to meet, she just wants to know a little more about the people you will be around. No harm in that.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	If your Mom wants to meet them before you go out its time. Good Luck!|`|ORqoMsqxaa	if u think you know each other very well, then you may tell ur parents|`|JveSbhSuaa	How old are you first of all?|`|eac6395cefa8580611452998c4a2f769aa	well you havent been going out long, but its not like they are going to have a sit down dinner together, just have your mom drop you off at his house or his mom at yours and let them talk a little and get to know each other.|`|26oLhhdraa	Let your mothers meet its not to early|`|AA11085356	I don't think it's too soon. It's not like it's going to change anything. Sometimes parents would feel more comfortable about letting their kids go over to other peoples houses after they have met the other parents. I wouldn't worrie about it.|`|KFUsmwItaa	idk how old are you? It seems to me the older you are the longer you wait. I have yet to take a girl  to meet the parents. A very strong defining line is if you still live at home or not.
9289bf36b0092af9fa7aa94f40349863aa	umm i dont kno if he does or not.. but maybe when you see him try to convo.. the only way to kno if you ask.. if your too scared to do that, then just ask his friends, or ask your friends to ask his friends who he likes.<br>  <br>  Ree|`|3b64d55f38714d4b534a070ab26f5d48aa	Sadly ... until he starts calling you, asks you out or makes some other overt effort then you can't know!<br>  <br>  Be approachable but not extremely avaialble.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	It's impossible to tell if he likes you based on that information. But hopefully this helps. When my crush liked me, he said hi to me every chance he got. He always smiled at me. He would wait for me after class, he would go out of his way to say something simple to me, And he always called me beautiful and hung out with me. But not all guys are the same, so it's always hard to tell. Does he always greet you, smile at you...compliment you? If not, then it sounds as though you are just another classmate to him.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	we dont know yet. but if hes staring, he must be attracted to something. maybe its in an unromantic way (like if he thinks your clothes are bright), maybe he's ADD, maybe he thinks youre hot and wants to be your boyfriend.<br>  however, proceed with caution. be cool, dont act like you like him. act unavailable. but always be funny and warm. say hi when you cross paths, but in a confident, smile and walk past way. no gushing or giggling. be a woman.<br>  then see where you go with that.good luck|`|JNY4BEASaa	no but you could always be friends just talk to him normally and try not to freeze up|`|oElpVlx8aa	no i think he's just talking to you|`|1dP7Viiuaa	he's popular. most likely a flirt who does it to one girl in all his classes. and whatever he did just sounded like he was just flirting/chatting casually. dont take staring incidents from guys seriously. they like checking out attractive girls. and it doesnt mean that since he finds you attractive, means he likes you. and he prob did it just to mess with your head anyway. stay away from the popular kinds.|`|5OgCrE3Yaa	I personally think he is trying to become more of friends with you to get to know you better, but I am not quite for sure if he like likes you. Tjt...Stop being mean, lol.|`|MQMregbvaa	Yeah he likes you when guys flirt and look that is a good sign of liking you ask his friend if he does!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well to me that's not liking he just wanted to talk to you but it depends how you feel|`|fJQFH3Woaa	well. become friends with him and see where that leads :)|`|EFGKxSsVaa	you never know, become friends with him. it can't hurt.|`|xS6BLvZZaa	no honey he does not like you sorry i was in the same position|`|P8O3dmmXaa	depends on wat it was that he said but i think he likes u yeah......|`|2vgbJhlRaa	sorry it sounds like he doesnt like you the way you do. but become friends who knows he might start to feel that way about you too. if a guy likes you he'll spend alot of time around you...does he do that? oh yea and dont invest too much time to a heartache tho, you sound like a great girl and if he doesnt appreciate that then its his loss, theres plenty of guys out there that will like you for who you are. best of luck :)|`|18cHcOC0aa	if he is comfortable enough to joke around with you, you probably have a good chance to become friends with him. as for him *like* liking you, you may have to get to know him better, as nothing indicates that he does or doesnt for sure.|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	dont get into conclusions. watch for more signs. list of signs down, click on link :<br>                     |<br>                     |<br>                     |<br>                    V|`|5GbzKQmTaa	Probably, because if he said "Just Kidding" it means he cares|`|MzEIoozyaa	awww :]<br>  <br>  he's totally into you!<br>  <br>  maybe you could ask if he wanted to go to the movies with you and some of your friends so he could get to know you better.<br>  <br>  good luck kiddo :]|`|cb2b43b8ec2e68ec2c7b5415eda851c5aa	i think hes flirting ; trying to see if you like him back or not.|`|8zxgf6HLaa	the only way to truely find out is to talk to him<br>  good luck :)|`|UAT38kYzaa	no it doesnt mean he likes you, hes being mean?<br>  but became friends with him, lol|`|1S2dDfXuaa	If he really liked you, youde kno ittttttt|`|hKMO5xJvaa	YESS!|`|iMNPH9I7aa	just kickin it|`|Bg3jPwACaa	no he hates you|`|aWH0wPDmaa	im pretty sure he doesn't...|`|yl3udnsLaa	yes, believe in me|`|igj6p3Zzaa	prolly not as much as u think. just a little. but u can always become friends with whoever you want :)|`|RVxI2cR5aa	wow tjt or what ever the hell your name is your an ***.. but any way! well he could just get to know him better:D|`|KxGe9tJHaa	You are probably one of those girls who doesn't yet know how pretty they really are, that will come with time.  If he is looking at you then he finds you physically attractive, but be careful because any honest high school guy would tell you that they are all just interested in sex.  If he saw another guy talking to you then he realizes that other guys are also finding you attractive, and that is making him more comfortable, guys worry just as much as girls when it comes to their reputation.|`|5qUUP1Rsaa	Be yourself and socialable with your friends. Don't ever think that you are just average as all people has their own unique point of attraction. You will not really know whether this guy really likes you or not unless he say it to you personally so don't think too much about it and live on to be yourself. Take things slowly and keep your options open instead of focusing on him. Hope things work out fine for you one day. Good Luck.|`|tI11Aax9aa	okay.<br>  dont listen to them...<br>  theres a possibility.<br>  (sorry im a teribble speller)<br>  anyways.<br>  try flirting with him.<br>  and start talking to him alot more.<br>  like if he has a cell ask for his number. <br>  or if he has a aim or myspace add him.<br>  lol.<br>  let me kno how it goes.<br>  <3<br>  tristen lynn|`|kWs0QiLnaa	the only way to find out if he likes you or not is getting to know him better<br>  ask him if he wants to hang out sometime, maybe with your group of friends and see were it goes form there<br>  good luck sweetie!!|`|GnM9xCX6aa	GET TO KNOW HIM.. i dont think that he likes you at the moment [to be very honest with you] because basically everyone jokes around with eachother.. right? just really get to know him.. and jump off from there! goodluck(;|`|eS4qUpXlaa	Sorry i don't think he dose become friends with him and see where it takes you|`|AA12396226	Sorry, No !|`|i5nhqZm5aa	no one ever knows with guys lol|`|lxOav1l3aa	If the comment was you're fat then i would have to say no i'm sorry, but you'll be okay here's what you do...<br>  <br>  You get an orangutan I'm not talking a little monkey or some dancing chimp bullshite I mean an effing orangutan dont ask me how you're going to get an efing orangutan becuase that is not my problem so the orangutans name is Clyde this is non negotiable all orangutans are named Clyde. I dont know why that is its just how the world works. So you and Clyde become man and ape about town. You're seen everywhere together you make the scene. You and your friends go out in big groups you talk loud you laugh louder everytime you say something witty you high five the oraguntan the town begins to buzz it gets back to him "Did you know the girl with the orangutan?" "Didn't you used to like the girl with the orangutan?" "Why would you not like a girl with an orangutan?" next thing you know he's calling<br>  <br>  "I'm hoping we can still be friends. Wanna hang out sometime?"<br>  "Geeze I dunno me and Clyde were going to a monster truck race tonight(orangutans love monster trucks) in fact the whole social calander seems kinda full I'll tell you what I'll make a little note (what was you're name again?) and maybe I can squeeze you in. Oh well, you know my number so dont be a stra-- hey gotta go Clyde's making mojitos."<br>   <br>  At this point the upper hand is yours. You can let him twist in the wind. You can draw him back into your life at the pace you decide. Whatever, it's your life. But if you're a smart woman you slowly phase him back in. You're IM-ing. You get invited to family functions. You bring Clyde, he becomes one of the family. You're one big Brady Bunch.
m3qmDfXTaa	you seem to be a wonderful person, you love her but i don't think she deserves you. She seems to be walking all over you.

Don't leave based on something that she could change her mind about in a week. You should probably talk to her about it. I mean, If you can't even talk to her about how you're feeling then it's not a good relationship anyways. just think about what you do before you do it. Where is this gonna put you in a year? Talk to some friends who would be honest with you and not just tell you what you want to hear. Don't do anything rash. Good Luck.
CBa9G4j4aa	You're definitely not stupid for being jealous. In fact I like when a boy is jealous. It means he actually cares and doesn't want to see me with anyone else. I think you should tell him. Honesty is the best policy but don't make it seem like it bugs you a lot. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|d8MvSJr4aa	Well he is supposed to be giving you respect by not constantly talking to this chick.

29hcn9JRaa	Their is no sure bet that he will marry you, as a matter of fact, the longer you are with him as a girlfriend and if you are shacking up with him, your odds of him ever making the decision to marry you becomes quite a bit slimmer. Hopefully you are not living together, because studies have shown that most people who live together are less likely to ever marry, as many men have the idea or notion of " why marry? when we live together, eat together, do things that many married people do? Why I am not condoning living together before marriage, as I have shacked up with my fair share of men, I am only suggesting to you that the chances of marriage gets lowered if you do live together. Also if you treat your man with respet and value, and treat him as you want to be treated, this will increase his desire to get married, after all what guy wants to marry a naggy, rude woman?|`|NpcSEJX1aa	you can try to ask him where he wants to be in the realionship in the next few years... please if you have not done this..then don't do it..give him a child..if you don't believe me ask a new question about that..giving a man a child and not being married..even if you ask him and he says yes..it not offical until the ink is dried on the paper..some will say yes to get what they want..or to keep you quite|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	You would like him to marry me?? read yr question again please, but if it was a miss spell mistake and u meant marrying u, then i would say, just get into some real relationship based on love and honesty and from there things will get better and brighter.<br>  <br>  Please answer or comment<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At0PoAd0vtZ85iydZJPUeiPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222174746AA1UfYG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AltQWn4k8.ufIlR0Yn.jOHXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222172803AAkyZKl">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|IpWTMetHaa	You want your man to marry you so bad, your words are all jumbled.<br>  The point is, a man, a woman, will only do what is in their heart and mind - no pressure.<br>  <br>  :)|`|DVvO70mOaa	Theres NO NEED to rush into marriage...its a wonderful thing but you but if u rush it  you take the very best part of it. <br>  Just be yourself..live your life...it will happen when its supposed to happen by mother nature.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	someone once said, "manipulate to get, manipulate to keep" so my advice is be the best person you can be and take your time.

You can find someone and rush into marriage but if you are to hasty the marriage could end in divorce.<br>  <br>  Try doing some volunteer work and meet people that share your interests.  Have faith and be patient.  You'll probably meet the right guy when you least expect it.  I listed some books below that may be helpful.
1PqbJzsnaa	this sounds funny !! don't open the door when she knocks, don't pick up the phone when she calls, and pretend you don't hear her when she says, "Hi".|`|bcTErNF6aa	Eat Onions and Garlic then have a conversation with Her she,ll stay away.P.S. understand.|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Ignore, stay away from her.

Z0lbrnHpaa	if it's something that will harm her or others than you should tell. if not, keep it to yourself.|`|1PqbJzsnaa	whatever the secret it, your friend trusted you to keep it confidential.  so don't tell it.  it's up to your friend to tell it.  <br>  <br>  maybe in the future you should tell your friend not to confide in you~ it's too much for you to bear.|`|JhWD9NJ4aa	im very understanding and also trustworthy<br>  heres my email - meggi_94_@hotmail.co.uk<br>  hope i can help :)|`|P8qwYZDraa	idk cuz i don't wat the secret is and if it is really bad|`|4AKiarekaa	umm i cnt rele tell u not to tell or not cuz i dnt kno how serious this is..|`|ePS5ggiTaa	my emails blakexy1125@aim.com i can understand alot of stuff that people tell me im also good at helping people|`|l8KW8qHraa	Well if the secret is something that is going to harm your friend then you should deffinately tell an adult.|`|AA11916218	I would talk to your parents about it and let them help you make the right decision on what to do about your friend.
RPPrfphqaa	you sound very young.<br>  "didnt think i forgot about you did you"<br>  thats very sweet to say, My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and i love when he says stuff like that.<br>  he just wants you to know that your still on his mind and he's thinking of you.<br>  if you dont love him let him go he deserves a nice girl to make him happy.<br>  you dont seem very interested in him so why dont you let someone else fall in love with him.<br>  sounds like he's stuck on you so tell him find a nice girl if your not interested which i dont think you truly are interested since you talk about him like he's no big deal.<br>  and say he's a "boy" not a man.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	I think he doesn't believe that you truly love him, maybe if you profess your love in a more prominent manner he will understand how your actually feeling.|`|dxeOlRBfaa	for #2 he just wants u to know he is still there for u. for #1 i have no clue|`|FFQeMfFlaa	Maybe he needs more confidence if sounds like to me that he really loves you and he just might need more confidence say something like "I dont think i could get a better than u" (but try not to sound like his girlfriend) Since you cant date, maybe he means that he isnt the BEST for u but he might be one of the top choices Hope this helps good luck =] :)|`|GsSRY7quaa	you answered your own question. you are not totally sure about this relationship. you don't say how old you 2 are, so i'm guessing teenagers. you should see a lot of other people just as he should too, stay friends and support each other.  David|`|b53k0EZkaa	okay...#2 no clue.....#1 i dont think he knows what love is truthfully...he needs to go and find out what is it, seriously though!|`|rZk0tr1daa	1. It sounds as though he's fishing for compliments, he wants you to say 'No you're beautiful/funny/lovely etc' because it makes him feel good.<br>  <br>  2. He wants you to say you didn't forget him either, that he was all you ever thought about etc etc.<br>  <br>  To be honest, it sounds as though he is playing mindgames with you.
61Fwbi79aa	My ex wife cheated on me, abandoned me with the kids anfter running up 45k worth of credit card debt. My revenge was to pick up my life and live it well. I paid off the debt, was a good father and am engaged to the most wonderful woman, and I neber looked back. You see, the best revenge is a life well lived.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	well i about two years ago i was going out with a guy <br>  <br>  we had been together for about 1 year and everything was great............<br>  <br>  but he cheated on me with my own aunt and my aunt wasnt no young women she was OLD and SAGGY<br>  <br>  well i caught them after one of my games behind the bleachers and she was going down on him which to me was gross cuz he was 14 and she was like 40 ewwwwwwwwwwwwww<br>  <br>  well he was in love with all of his damh shoes so the next day i went to his house while he was at practice and told his mom what i saw <br>  <br>  and his mom was the best she let me go to his room and i got all his shoes and took them to the sandbox in the backyard<br>  <br>  i put them all next to each other like on display and i got some lighter fluid and put alot on every shoe and when he got home his mom told him i was outside waiting for him <br>  <br>  and right when he got outside i threw a lit match and burnt all of his shoes<br>  <br>  it was crazy but it made me feel soooooooooooooooooooooo good and  dont think that the mom just let me burn the shoes that she bought him cuz all the shoes i burnt his dad bought him so she had no problem lol<br>  <br>  im older and i dont think i would ever do that again lol|`|nxMi4adjaa	I used to share a room with older sister. She's a real pain. One day she was really mean to me and she hurt my feelings. Back then all I wanted to do was tag along and all. Anyway she was supposed to go out to the movies with her friends. When she was leaving the house I went to the bedroom window and watched her get in the car. Then I ran back to our room. Not five minutes later she came running back in the room and said "on second thought I'll stay home" It was fun I didn't even do anything but the thought of what I might do made her stay home.
AuSjEjtMaa	I wouldn't get yourself worked up. If you have a solid and trustful relationship he won't cheat. And if he does then obviously he wasn't the right one anyway if he isn't trustworthy.|`|QrbwYLaIaa	i dont think he would cheat on you.|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	if you trust him, then you don't need to worry. If you have a trustful friend from the school he's going to, ask her to keep an eye on him for a while until you realize he's not going to pull any sneaky crap.
RwYIhCg8aa	I'd suggest counselling.  And I hope that F-ING PIG is in jail for what he did to you!  <br>  <br>  Loosen up.... that's a harsh thing to say to a person that has gone through what you just have, I know... I've been there!<br>  <br>  Tell him you're moving to Florida to live with me!  You're MOVIN' ON! Movin' on down to FLORIDA!|`|GQUaFGHLaa	Your dad told you what he did because he thinks that he has not done anything wrong. I have a friend who was sexually abused by her dad and he thinks that he has done nothing wrong. Remember-the day will come when both your parents will pay for the things that they have done. If it were me I would have nothing to do with my parents and I would walk out of their life's for good.|`|1HTRWrawaa	I'd tell my father to go straight to hell!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  If that happened to me and my father took sides with my mother and against me after what your mother did to you, then I wouldn't want anything to do with him either.<br>  <br>  If you are under 18 and living with your dad, then I would get some counselling and legal advice to help you with what happened to you and protect you from future abuse from your mother. You can't depend on your dad to protect you or help you through the abuse that you have had to endure. It's up to you to find someone to help you.<br>  <br>  If you are over 18 and living on your own, then tell your dad that since he thinks the sexual abuse you have been put through is no big deal and being with your mother is more important then having you for a daughter, then you don't need either one of them in your life. If he ever wakes up to the truth about your mother and the hell she has put you through and is ready to see how wrong is was for him to turn his back on you when you needed him the most, then maybe you can forgive him and the two of you can repair your relationship, but until then, he can be with your mother and they can both go to hell.|`|AA10450505	As, well, you should! Report your mother to your local authorities. Report the man who abused you, as well. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder is not something about which you can "loosen up" or "move on" from. You need care, counsel, understanding and love. Your father is either misinformed or in denual. Please, put yourself first and get help. You are woth it.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Oh dear...I'm so sorry to hear about this!<br>  Abuse is NEVER acceptable!<br>  <br>  You are perfectly entitled to feeling the way you do...You were a victim and you were wronged. Telling someone who has undergone abuse to just "loosen up" is both stupid and cruel!<br>  <br>  Please consider getting professional help....counseling or therapy can help you to vent and to address all the feelings you have inside. <br>  <br>  You could also go to church and talk to your pastor or priest...They have heard just about everything and they could give you words of encouragement as well as Bible verses so you can work on letting God heal you.<br>  <br>  Good luck. You will be in my prayers!|`|AA10928125	I would feel like he did the abuse himself...when men act that way it just seems like your getting abused all over again...I know words cannot take your hurt away,try to get into counceling if you can...when you get older this will effect your love life,your marriage,the way you treat your children,your spouse and your in-laws...you need to talk it out and good for you about taking this to court...good luck and God Bless.|`|xIwPjhojaa	Did you report the abuse, there is no statute of limitation !  have him jailed and then Heal, and try to collect $ damage for pain and suffering and a good Therapist, sorry, and good luck , and pleas try not let this (ahol) ,destroy you and your future and your MOTHER and father, needs a GOOD KICK in the a-- !!!!!!!|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	i would be extremely angry!! but angry to the point where i would just cut them both off!! your mother for not seeing it, a mother knows and can feel when a perv is around their kids. your mother was just being to selfish and put you aside. and your father, its almost like he thinks you deserved it or something. like he is taking the anger he has for your mother on you!! i would be angry at both of them|`|5eSSAT69aa	this happened to me only it was my dad who did it and my mom told me to lighten up and get over it. I no longer associate with either of them. I beg you to go to the police, even if ur an adult.

03ccdec50586f6903629b58b15507712aa	No, you're not wrong for dating the one guy while still in love with the one that moved. you can love more than one person, just in different ways. I don't believe you're wrong for breaking up with the one that moved, relationships are hard enough without having to worry about distance.
kUE3Ddktaa	This is a great question because there is no right answer - it just depends on the couple.<br>  <br>  Some couples will buy each other's wedding rings. For some couples, either the bride or the groom (or their families) will pay for both rings, depending on finances. In other couples, all the wedding money goes into one "fund," some of which is used to pay for the rings.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, once a couple is married their finances are shared. So it's not really "his money" or "her money" anymore. Any way you slice it, you are both buying the rings together.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Traditionally, she is supposed to pay for his and he is supposed to pay for hers.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	I bought his, I was going to buy his anyway but he asked me for it last christmas cause he wanted to wear it now before we get married, I had 2 rings (he originally had just given me a white gold band when he proposed and then later bought me a small $800 diamond nothing big but I love it) he wanted a ring too but he wanted yellow gold. A lot of couples are doing that these days, I'm wearing both my rings and he is wearing his. I find it more meaningful if you buy each other's rings, marriage is a promise that I give him, why should he buy his own ring? When we get married these same rings will be engraved and blessed.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	The tradition is, you buy his and he buys yours.  For us, we're just putting our money together and buying both.  It's not a huge deal since our fiances are already one. And for others, you'll soon be sharing finances so it's not really a huge issue.<br>  <br>  Digital One, there are other diamonds you know.  The Canadian diamond is one of the nicest and is NOT a "blood" diamond. Besides, this question is about wedding bands not engagement rings.  Take your agenda elsewhere.|`|96HWpdkFaa	My husband and I put our money together and payed for both.|`|RDWVoc9Naa	when i get married we will buy them together|`|CLJXTsFJaa	It is the decision of the 2 people getting married.<br>  <br>  Some couples like to have matching rings so will buy them together.<br>  <br>  Some couples like to surprise their loved one with a ring on their wedding day<br>  <br>  And some buy them seprately but know before their wedding day what ring they are getting.  <br>  <br>  we are having surprise rings for our wedding. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|X1ygowVQaa	Traditionally the bride purchases the grooms ring. Luckily for us ladies, it's much easier than the grooms job!!!! Guys normally don't care what kind of ring it is besides a preference of white or yellow gold and they are much cheaper. I spent a whopping $200 on my hubbys ring and he paid $6000 for mine so I'll take that any day :)|`|EetB3Jpyaa	I guess the bride buys groom's ring, traditionally. We lived together and had joint accounts before getting married. So everything for the wedding, we paid together including the rings.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	I bought his. I let him pick it, but I bought it since he bought mine. I'm not sure if that's really "tradition" or anything, I just thought it was fair. He never asked me to, but I wanted to.|`|3MDY29gnaa	well my hfiance bought a 3pc set. My engagement ring, my wedding band, and hid band all in 1. Now and days it really doesnt matter.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	my husband bought my engagement ring we bought the wedding bands together.|`|EJSdI25Naa	His and hers. It's his job. Not many men want a wedding ring, anyway.|`|HdbVkGQdaa	I bought bot mine and my wifes. I purchased it online. It was quick simple and easy.
FHQZz8dNaa	It means you are classy and polite. You know how to carry yourself and very mature. I think that is a hint that he likes you. Keep being who you are!!!|`|g5YlV35zaa	It depends on how you look at it. Proper could mean a bunch of different things. It could mean you are like one of those proper "young ladies" that everyone sees as going to church 4 times a week and all that. Or it could just mean that like he thinks that you dont do stuff like make out and have sex and stuff.|`|d5kt46e5aa	It means you are polite, you talk well, and don't sound ignorant when you speak, or in the way you act. <br>  <br>  The way things are supposed to be done EX. a boy pulling out a chair for a girl at dinner is the proper thing to do.|`|7Y72LqiPaa	It's like slang for sexy or good looking. He thinks your cute and attractive. He might want to have a relationship with you , if you think hes attractive than go out for lunch or dinner more often.<br>  <br>  Good luck , <br>  <br>  God BLESS|`|8w5HAnE4aa	it means you have good manners, right? so i guess thats good. unless he means that you always follow the rules, he might think thats bad.|`|CL6aPgljaa	Don't worry! Proper is like saying someone is 'sound' if you don't know what that means, it means good hearted but fun to be around kind of thing. It's a good thing, good luck x|`|hm4oU8bDaa	It means that you are:<br>  conforming to established standards of behavior or manners; correct or decorous.|`|NrkX5Souaa	well, i think it means that u r fitting,appropriate and respectful|`|RNDvIS0zaa	Ehh. Popular male seniors are dangerous. Especially if they're athletes. Beware. I'm not saying he's a jerk, but there's a high chance that he's not near as cool as he seems. Be careful. Proper? Ehh, I don't know. Maybe he thinks you're not a ****?|`|b53k0EZkaa	i have no flippin idea!<br>  <br>  <br>  srry i cant help ? but please ppl help me with mu quiestions ?|`|y39iNwFjaa	Well it's an old fashioned word that means pretty and good - so guess it's a good thing :)|`|NJ9Ytksraa	IDK.<br>  This question has a point though.|`|v2gyKb9Zaa	it's good<br>  i'm not sure if he meant it in the slang way, or if he's from the united kingdom, or something. but a lot of people in the united kingdom (especially british people) use that word. it could be used in place of "well-mannered" or "classy" or something positive like that. if he used it in a slang way, then he means that you're hot/cute/attractive.|`|oaVhxc8caa	That is a good thing. I think!!!!|`|G9UtWL7Faa	proper to me woulda translate as uptight....or well mannered|`|JveSbhSuaa	He thinks you are middle class, kind of the opposite to common.<br>  I'd take it as a compliment :)
Kh5o3QCcaa	You can't change how he feels.  If you are not looking for marriage right now and you want to stay in this otherwise happy relationship feel free, just don't do so expecting him to change.  If he does great!  But don't set your hopes on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to invest time now into somebody you have hopes to marry, this guy has already given you your answer, and it would be a waste of your time to 'hope' it out.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	He may never change his mind, especially because he has been raised with marriage as a non-priority.  Since you value marriage, he may not be the right guy.  I know that sounds harsh but it's better to determine this now than to waste years on an incompatible relationship.  It will be very difficult to have a successful, long term relationship if you have different core values.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	you guys are young so give it time, maybe he will change his mind. you never know. don't waste your time harping on it and what if you aren't together till then.|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Unless you want to do as his parents, then move on. He is doing what he's learned. It's not compatible with your belief system you are with the wrong guy.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Oh, he's just a boy.  I don't think you can take anything he says too seriously at this point.|`|KSK22vHUaa	He'll hit 22 and be desperate to find someone to put a ring on.  Don't worry about it.|`|8ossSEMNaa	Having similar beliefs is important in a relationship. If you feel marriage is an important institution and he doesn't, its not an issue of getting married RIGHT now as you said, its an issue of not being compatible. On one hand I would say just relax since you're only 19 but at the same time, its smart to think of your future and avoiding heartbreak and dissapointment. After all, the whole point of dating is finding the one who is a right fit for you.|`|46Qn6kdraa	he doesn't believe in marriage because he is nervous of having to be faithful to you and only you for the rest of your lives. and hes not read to yet give up on other woman and were the rings that clearly state "im married"|`|ShdV8jm4aa	He wants you guys to be like his parents. Happy and together for a very long time. But he sees that they didn't get married and he has their beliefs. I wouldn't worry about it too much. You can always have a bonding ceremony of some type!
AA12204338	Well probably the reason you snapped at him is because your twin is acting different and in a bad way.  He's causing you and her to go against your parents and do things you normally would never do.  I say you should refuse to be an accomplice to her crimes and let her know if you do this you do it on your own.  That may cause her to look better @ what she's doing.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Why are you in there business? Let her be in trouble. And if your parents find out about that, tell them that you weren't in it.|`|HAJuloFfaa	well he is your sisters bf, and for her to have him round while your parents were out.. she must really like him. even though you dont like him maybee you should just try to get on with him for your sisters sake?|`|mDMnhqwdaa	If you don't like him..just stay from around him or don't say anything to him, but you really should respect your sister by not being mean to him..because that's her boyfriend.
glm9d0uEaa	That may be because people have this habit of make funof this matter, then when someone make a joke about anything on your body you might react the same way, but penis is something more personal, and well they souldn't care about it because is not such a big deal for women.|`|KJxwNfsaaa	it drives them crazy cause of us girls.<br>  we have expectatioins.<br>  we need a pretty big penis to get pleasure.<br>  and if the guy has a small one, well then he cant really keep up can he ?|`|65ecae20f0ade905381af6cc841421f0aa	The truth is painful, and I am not sure you want to hear it, but penis size is the most important thing in how much pleasure a guy can give a girl in sex.<br>  <br>  Some girls say that a big penis is good, but skills as a lover is better. Well, maybe that is true, but a guy with a big penis AND skills is obviously the best of all.<br>  <br>  Consider this also. A guy with an average penis and good skills will always be only that, you can't make his penis bigger. But a guy with a big penis and not so great skills can be educated by the right woman (like me!) and will then give the best of all worlds.<br>  <br>  So to sum up, penis size is all important, because everything else can be improved and changed, except for that.|`|3jmg9j9Eaa	I think the question should be:<br>  Why penis size drive women crazy? Do women care about it?<br>  If the answer is yes, then ?it is natural for men to think about it.<br>  If the answer is no, then the question of why do we get worried makes sense.<br>  Because if women care about it, then the situation is similar to a situation a women is not pretty. Why does she care about it ?, well the one reason is because we "men" think it is important.|`|8QFjKktOaa	well my personal opinion about it is that they think that we like large penis' or they are always thinking and sometimes asking if they have a "keeper size" and for me size counts, it's better if they have it big ...but if not guys start practicing with the fingers a man has to do his job...please the woman you love...so STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT!|`|ilrtnZPyaa	It might be because if they have a small one they will be ashamed and will think that the girl does not like it, or it could be because scientifically a bigger penis represents more chance of reproducing.|`|1IaH1KmOaa	its very simple, women as men do, they like some parts of the body that they enjoy in bed and part of our men pride is drve women crazy, so, as we now they enjoy size, so that is why we are so worried about that topic|`|Gs2Mrfutaa	Because they think that women will refuse them for the size and for the ego because they think the bigger it is better, but my opinion is that the size doesnt matter.|`|WAdqGjMbaa	I think that is a  vanity issue, we all like that they speak well of us (we all know that the women speak among them of those things) and besides because the size aid to satisfy and everybody feels happy when satisfies a girl.|`|muidAp9aaa	damn !, what kind of question is this?, well I guess size matter men because is our manliness. And there is no one that can handle a life with a small one because girls make jokes about it.|`|3rlJMwCiaa	because the size drive women  crazy ? :O
jRUGj2fsaa	I would go for it... chances are something good will come out from it rather than something bad. and just don't be an a-hole, which is probably why she hates her ex|`|fC8OPOTkaa	if you do go out with her and decide to split, tell her you still want to be friends and don't want to end up hating one another or not speaking.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. good luck.<br>  <br>  :) X|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Usually, if the guy or girl cheated on one another, then they wouldn't be friends at all.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	um there is no law that says you can't be friends? i don't get why people think its such a crime to remain friends after a break up. usually when best friends confess they have a thing for a each other, one always says they just wants to be friends and then things become awkward and the relationship is not the same anymore. that's based on all the questions ive seen on here. so just be prepared.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	sometimes exes can be friends and YES it depends on how they break up. It is awkward when a friend ask you out, cause after ya ll never be the same.|`|a1xSsDryaa	Sometimes yeah,<br>  Depends what the situation is like and how the relationship ended.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	Exes can be frienldy, but more often then not, they are best left alone.  Be very careful, too, of someone who is "great friends" with all of thier ex's.  While it's possible that all situations could have ended amicably, usually they don't and the person has a warped reality of what a "friend" really is.<br>  <br>  As for your friend, you are jumping the gun here.  She may say yes, and even if she doesn't, she's not going to instantly hate you.  If she does get goofy, that's her problem, not yours.  <br>  <br>  As a general rule for all you young guys:  Don't worry about "ruining friendships" with girls.  If you are interested, go for it.  Girls, as a whole, don't view friendship the same way guys usually do, and therefore make bad friends.  Think about it: don't they usually take more then give in the friendship?  Are they doing things for you or that make you happy? Are they trying to set you up with their friends, etc.?|`|bMk6xZaSaa	Yes. You will always have that slight feeling of liking the person, and it will be awkward at first, but my best friend was my boyfriend for 6 months. He and I can talk about anything now, especially other people we're dating because we know how the other dates.  Its actually really nice having someone to tell you what to do and what not to do because they know you so well. Just don't let yourself like the person again.  If you know they are not right for you, then let it go.  If you still like the person, lay low for a while until things clear up a bit and then you can come back to them.  Good luck.|`|dthWo7u6aa	exes can be good friends... and yes that does depend on how you break up.. if it's a nasty break-up then it could be a while before you become friends again..if at all... but if you can be adults about it then you can get through the pain of a break-up... and in answer to your other question.. of course it can be abit awkward if you ask your friend out and they say no.. but again it depends how you ask and how you respond to the 'no' response... if you take the 'no' badly then there's a possibility you might lose your friendship.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Yeah sure they can but it depends on the Break up. If it was huge break up with one side being nice and the other cheating, or if it was a 'its not gonna work out' agreement.<br>  <br>  1. They hate each other<br>  2. They are friends|`|daQcjqyXaa	yes, they can still be friends.  unless if one cheated on the other.  then that would be kind of weird.<br>  and i think you should try it!  make sure you tell her that even if she doesn't want to go out, you still want to be friends.|`|tfIwNKfkaa	if u lik her go for it!! and if it dont work ou ~!!! dont cheat or ani tn jst sai we tried as more dan friends it didnt work and jst go bac as bein friends!! bu dont hold ba coz uz cud be lik soaul mates or somtin;) !! <br>  <br>  hope i helpd a lil !! :P|`|UTGDIOsOaa	apsolutly|`|mP6naFLDaa	well I'm friends with my first ex whom I dated more than once but we are stilll good friends|`|h3Nw5JLmaa	Exes can still be friends but not as good as they use to be and yes it does matter if they break up. Because if it was a bad break up they most likely won't be friends but if it wasn't so bad than they can. It can get real awkward if a friend ask you and and you say no but you will get over it.|`|HkDx9erWaa	Sure you can be friends with an ex. Will it be awkward at times? of course. If the relationship ends on good terms and neither of you have any lingering feelings you could have a great friendship afterward.<br>  If you ask her out & she declines, as long as you're both mature about it, it shouldn't have that big of an impact. She will probably second guess everything you do for her wondering if it's an attempt to win her heart.<br>  hope this helps & good luck|`|5EWmu0M8aa	why don′t you try to find out before asking her out? Look into her eyes just a bit longer when you look at each other. That usually tells a lot. At least it will give you a hint on how to move on.|`|pwiRMmicaa	tell her that you dont want to hurt ur friendship and it depends on how you guys break up and how bad you feel that makes a person not want to be friends with their ex's|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	I think it's rare but possible.

If he happens to bring it up just tell her to tell the truth - if he's a mature guy I'm sure he won't freak out. It's natural.|`|J9S0M9Cmaa	Say nothing at all.|`|1854fb53779c38ad23e299fcc95f6010aa	Don't say anything at all ever .|`|31gN5L58aa	don't tell him<br>  duh~~~~ <br>  it would spare a lotta embarasment :)|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	She should call him and tell him that she realized she had gotten her period while they were out and she just wanted to be sure that his seat was ok.<br>  <br>  That gives him the opportunity to check and see if there's a spot there and treat it but also gives her an out because she didn't know.  If he's rude about it then he's not worth it.|`|S5x6KNHraa	act like u know nothing about it and go to something like auto zone and buy something to remove the stain don't let your br see it|`|fLGz9Mo3aa	omg that freakin sux! but tell him. dont say it your period say you had a big cut on your finger and you forgot then put your finger on the seat|`|6PbyKpHzaa	don't say anything because he will not figure it out until you tell him
sbeoF50gaa	Well first, if he doesn't stick around because you don't wanna "go there" with him and he can't understand that you're not ready then he's not even worth keeping around. As for how to tell him, just be open and honest. Let him him know you're not ready to "go there" You are only 14 and will have LOTS of boyfriends and LOTS of time to experience life and relationships. BTW props for waiting and knowing when you are ready.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	I'd suggest that you tell him if he wants a relationship with you that he better not expect to get what he got with his other girlfriends. Tell him everything you told us, that your not emotionally ready for that.<br>  <br>  Just tell him that if he wants to date you that he better not expect something like what he got before, and if he doesn't date you because you don't want to do like his ex's, than he is not worth it.|`|0YS37jqgaa	You can do plenty of other things without going "all the way".<br>  But, if you're uncomfortable with more than making out, tell him so.<br>  if he doesn't want to date you after wards, his loss, find someone who will wait.<br>  You may be uncomfortable at first, but get to know him and you may feel like doing more.<br>  <br>  Plus you don't have to tell him right away, wait until things get more serious, because your feelings might change by then.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Email me if you need anything.|`|m6mjcGdKaa	when he asks you out, just let him know<br>  <br>  this is  like what i went through last year, same ages and everything...<br>  <br>  wear a ring. <br>  when he asks you out just be like "do you really like me?" and he'll say yes, of course. and then tell him something like "i really like you too, but um just so you know, this is a purity ring..." and then see how it goes<br>  and it doesnt really have to be a purity ring<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  just be honest and tell him "i really like you, but just so you know, im not going to go all the way, im not ready for that, is that ok?"|`|nVdYIHhzaa	tell him that. that right there is a great thing to tell a guy. if you tell a guy that and he runs, it means he was just in it for sex. if he stays you know he really likes you. i know girls that have had sex before that tell guys that just to see if they're really in it for the girl or if they're in it for the sex.|`|o3d3NBVzaa	Um, tell him? Have a conversation on the topic. If he respects you, then he won't try anything beyond what you are comfortable with.|`|9vckO6Cbaa	Set boundaries early. If you don't set boundaries, he'll cross your line of comfort. If he tries anything that's "too much" for you, then push his hand away and tell him no. <br>  <br>  If he persists, give him a second chance. If he continues to try even after you've said no, then don't stay with him. If he does not respect your boundaries, he is not worth your time.|`|crbzVL0Haa	Tell him. <br>  <br>  If he walks away and says he's done, so what?<br>  <br>  Don't do anything you're not ready for.<br>  <br>  BTW he's probably lying ANYWAY. <br>  <br>  High school boys do that. <br>  <br>  A lot.|`|k9N6PInEaa	ur 14 years old, relax. Ur too young to be thinking about a bf and even sex. Even if u go and date him anyway, he should understand that ur not ready for that..if he doesnt, then hes not worth it.|`|zlQNr40Uaa	go out with him...just make sur it doesnt go too far|`|hwKFm7H8aa	he wants you physically as well as mentally.<br>  if you dont want to but still want a relation ship with him,..then just go out with him..he is not going rape u or anything..he likes u...he wants to be with u|`|3AaVoenoaa	Tell him you want to wait until your married or something like that. And if he loves you he will respect that if he doesn't then he doest love you he just wants to get into your pants
XH2o1MM6aa	.Daisy honesty is the best policy.Tell him you don't feel the same chemistry anymore.Or just say you need some space and time to set goals.So lets have a break

ms5sRLOPaa	this is what i did with my boyfriend that i gust broke up with i side "i don't fell so shure about us but you are a really nice guy and i still want to be friends and everything" and now we are like best friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s if this works out email me at marcottemichaela@yahoo.com<br>  hope this helps.|`|8H6qhuabaa	Well, if you don't know what he looks like, then wouldn't that be even easier to break up with him?<br>  Seriously, I dated loads of guys who I didn't even like because they asked me out and I didn't even like him but I said yes anyways because I felt bad to reject.<br>  Now I know, it feels like crap to be dating someone you don't even like when your heart got stolen by some other guy.<br>  Just say... "Hey, uhmm, you're a super nice guy, and we barely even know each other and my friend just hooked us up. I would date you if I got to know you much better, but for now lets just go our own ways and maybe next time would be better, I'm sorry, really sorry, but it's true isn't it?"<br>  Try it (:|`|gK2DAX1paa	Like this. "I am sorry Mr. Nice Guy but i am so wrapped up in my classes/work that i barely have anytime for myself. If you are the nice guy that i know you are, you should understand." he will probably try to counter with offering to help you with some of your loads, but you just reply, " That's sweet but i have to pull through this on my own, thanks though." And that is how you break up with Mr. Nice Guy.|`|Mk4ggDa5aa	not to sound mean or anything but why would you get with someone who you dont know in the first place and that your friend hooked you up with? anyways, i would think that the best thing would be to tell him in person. Just explain to him that you didn't realize the mistake you made in getting with him in the first place. I would assume that it'd be better if you do it now than later, in case he gets attached or something.|`|IIIKFDOoaa	Tell him in a understanding way. Say you just don't have those feelings for him. But you could still be friends or say something nice like " I would be happy to study with you Saturday night." or you could make him feel great in his heart that you aren't the only one he could ever love by saying "I saw her gazing at you in Geometry". Bottom line, just don't hurt him!!|`|R12ED8nIaa	okay, so all you have to do is let him off politely (in person).  Bringing up "i don't like you" is prolly not the way to go.  so something like "i think there's been a misunderstanding . . ."<br>  <br>  also i agree with the other guy that you should prolly mention that you want to be friends.|`|SsjXGhL2aa	I think you'd be better off to tell him face to face hunny! Face the Music, things like this are going to happen and even worse involving guys and break ups, if you don't have any interest in him, i think it's best you get it over with befor he gets over his head with you! Ya heaar! ;)|`|OdFIQYyhaa	try to be honest and serious at the same time.  go ahead and break up it will hurt. my sister broke up with her last boyfriend and she started smoking.  i try my best to stop her.  <br>  <br>  but do what you please, do what you think is right|`|Dowi63iuaa	I know how you feel. And just tell him that you two should just get to know eachother and you two should just be friends until anything goes on between you. Because you would rather date someone you know well. Honesty is always important.|`|QUlDuixBaa	Huh?? You don't even know what he looks like? You don't like a nice guy... ok, your loss, just not sure how you think you need to break up with someone you don't even know?

You could ask him if you guys can remain friends for now on.|`|1uRUaSblaa	If you are not interested in him, I suggest that you just<br>  let him know he is a very nice guy but you <br>  do not feel ready to have a date with him.<br>  Then cut down your contact with him.<br>  He will  get the hint.|`|RqqAzFFEaa	Best to be frank with him then to mislead him.He should accept the truth like a man.|`|SorcFv62aa	who gives a shet you dont even know the guy|`|tTIXhe7daa	Just try being with him|`|2S2onP86aa	Just tell him in a clam nice way that you think there is no common between you too, and that you are interested.

I am so sorry, but better said now than later. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped, good luck.|`|6zdsHX0uaa	Okay...1: you should never commit to someone that you dont know.....<br>  But I must say that is the best way to le someone go...NOT IN PERSON if you wouldnt want to hurt there feelings.........And just let him know that you want to be friends and call it a day......|`|prjXvpL8aa	Do it in person. just do it nicely and it wont be awkward. don't do it around a lot of people|`|MHgTA9Buaa	tell him the truth maybe he is someone who wont take things like that personal. tell him u like his personality and all but you dont see where there will be any chemistry between you too. all the best|`|vPkQpNQHaa	be really nice and tell him that you're really sorry but you're not trying to be in a relationship right now|`|lIx6kngbaa	In a really really nice way.|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	Be honest with this nice guy...He'll live.|`|4pKIllAeaa	be yourself
cbLsxrr7aa	I hope you know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being gay. You could possibly be gay or bisexual (like guys and girls); don't rule it out. Or it could just be a "man-crush." That's when you have strong feelings for someone who isn't of the gender you usually have crushes on. It is definitely not a mental disorder! =]|`|phK29PFKaa	I think that's sort of a homosexual behavior. That's not brotherly love anymore.|`|4Lzf3wenaa	Well, everything that you describe is similar to me and my best friend, but I never imagine holding hands or anything.  I don't think that you are homosexual, but think of what these feelings are.  Are they simply strong feelings of friendship or more.  I find my friend as simply someone who is always there for me and I like being around him because I went through a not so great friend experience back in jr. high and now that I have a friend who genuinely cares, how can I not want to be around him.  In my case though, I talk to him about my girl problems, so not homosexual, but thank god to have him as a good friend.|`|XmXY1IrCaa	No, thats totally normal. Just because ur emotionally attached to this person does not mean ur a homosexual. It could be as something as u admire his person so much because of how good of a friend he is that u want to become closer to him. But since u guys r so close already in ur mind thats the only way to get closer.|`|IKkU3retaa	yes it is a completely normal and natural thing.|`|zIrTm8Ymaa	im not judging you but....<br>  <br>  <br>  no boy you gay you don't suppose to have those fellings.
SzFxjFiWaa	Depends on his personality , if he's sensitive then just turn the topic whenever he brings it up . Otherwise, just say it directly and yet politely that u ain't like his talking about money .|`|iR7StHksaa	just tell him that you are happy for him but you want you and him to be friends with more than just talking about money...please answer my question|`|2IK3PvAEaa	Be upfront with him.  Let him know that you would prefer it if he didn't discuss his salary with you.|`|A7sEYC9iaa	be honest, and tell him that  what he is doing is personal, its' rude, and it could get him in trouble if the wrong people overhear him. they may just try to rip him off! He IS your friend, so be a friend to him.
AA11324847	Stop worrying about him. He doesn't care enough about you and one day his dick will fall off from an STD, find yourself a man who loves you, and NEVER settle for less than you need emotionally. It's common for girls to compromise their morals for "attention" or "love", when they are completely blind.|`|mnn8hYbtaa	If a guy was treating me like that I'd assume I'd been dumped.

k59o2PZaaa	It's more than ok for a guy to write a poem about a girl. I've been with my boyfriend for a year and he's never written me a poem until he had to write a sonnet for class and chose to write it about me. He read it to me on Valentines day and it made me cry. Poems and heartfelt things definitely mean more than just about anything you can buy a girl. You don't have to be the best writer.. just write about how you feel. It doesn't have to rrhyme or anything.|`|UiP2WBVmaa	I like it, my boyfriend wrote me a poem for my last birthday. It was one of the sweetest things I've ever gotten.

I would go for it.|`|t4ebT9araa	sure!<br>  if you have that confidence, go for it!|`|AA11040944	Maybe but guyz r the one thats suppose to do that|`|Yqk8F2gUaa	Might be a lil weird..|`|W6o3UQLkaa	do it, that would be cool|`|8v40KEd0aa	Not weird at all, I've done it.|`|ImqsLCaPaa	i know exactly what your saying!! i'd say go for it. you could end up marrying the guy ;) <3 haha|`|IhyeG900aa	no that wouldnt be weird at all. if you seem to have a connection with a guy then hey, go for it. whats the worst that could happen.?|`|2456c64a5133009717e218e7364993a5aa	I don't think its creepy. You generally can tell when theres a mutual "attraction" there so if you are brave enough go for it I say!!
kvmWDuOJaa	That's why you shouldn't ask a friend to do it for you (:<br>  Just ask him! If you're more direct, he's so much more likely to say yes, and if you do that then there won't be any mis-communication (:<br>  I know it's nerve-wracking, but a lot of guys think that shy girls are cute. Just get to know him enough that it won't be so difficult to ask him yourself.<br>  I'm sure he will love you! Good luck!<br>  <br>  If I helped, please consider voting for me?

I mean . . . maybe she likes the guy too, didn't ask him then told you he said no . . . its a bit crazy I know but that stuff happens, ask him yourself?! Why didn't you ask him yourself in the first place instead of being childish . . . you want him to DANCE with you but you won't even TALK to him . . .|`|4EozzPDSaa	it could be that, or maybe your friend could have a jealous spot for you and changed the answer? im not saying you shouldnt trust your friend but if the answer kept changing..<br>  tbh, you should of asked him yourself in the first place, guys like confidence in a girl,|`|UY9KZhgpaa	it all depends but for an total decision ask him|`|AA10373112	Your friend could be lying if the answer keeps changing :( Maybe she likes him or something.

G7bDuuZ8aa	First of all I'm also Mexican and pedito your racist.<br>  Anyway I had an Asia (Filipino) friend and she told me that she would never date outside he race because it was against her customs. I know that's just one person but maybe the Asian women you have met have these same 'customs'.<br>  I do see a lot of people not just Asians looking down on us Mexicans. Especially when the Mexican can't speak perfect English and has a heavy accent.<br>  Many people think Latinos are lazy, uneducated, thieves. We just need to prove them wrong. If some Asian chick doesn't want to date you because your Hispanic then forget about her. Don't waste your time on racist people because lifes to short and its just not worth it.|`|cHM2US6xaa	Okay, I don't want to read all this.<br>  <br>  But anyone can date anyone.<br>  Don't generalize. There would be at least one asian woman out there who would date a latino man.<br>  Heck, I'm sure they are plenty !|`|AA10744471	You are what you think! Maybe it is just your perception. But no, Asian women don't hate Latinos or any other ethnic groups. The truth of the matter is that Asian women also feel discriminated in America. But again, that is just a perception. <br>  <br>  I think you are handsome and sexy because of that moustache. Relax. Latinos are extremely handsome and the ladies are very sexy, and your language (mostly Spanish) is very exotic and nice too.|`|aljwyBA9aa	awwww.. no no no...<br>  i LOVE latino men! my goodness...<br>  i'm like esp. attracted to them haha.. they are soooo good looking<br>  i'm asian :] i've hooked up with some REALLY good looking latino men before, so don't worry<br>  but i don't like moustaches|`|pJZBdpehaa	There are also people in Africa who ain't got a choice.<br>  <br>  Get a life.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	maybe its ur whole attitude. ur paranoia and shyness.<br>  <br>  u should try being more open, and for god sakes, dnt think sth unless u can be sure!|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	they are no different from the rest uf us. no one really cares for mexicans.........|`|IRv1Rgdhaa	umm im just like you, i am latino, and my inglish is broken a little bit, BUT a few months ago a new gurl came to my school, AND SHES ASAIN! =] she came from the Philipiens and now me and her are like best friends! we tell eachother everything! and shes always helping me out with school, she doesnt discriminate me =] I HOPE I HELPED|`|WNjgE3MNaa	Noooo<br>  im asian and i love mexicanos and other latinos<br>  i think alot of you guys are friendly, funny and loving<br>  my boyfriends mexican american and hes the best that i could ever ask for<br>  and also i seen alot of other asian and latino couples together<br>  so do not lower yourself thats probly it<br>  dont think about all that stuff and jus be yourself<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|jBIaUfUzaa	I know where you are comming from my dads girlfriend is asain and she allways makes fun of our mexican friends an i think thats wrong of her <br>  i was afraid to tell her that my fiance was half mexican but i did an i told her off !!<br>  im white/female by the way|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	I think as long as you act confident and you handle yourself well, no matter from where you are nobody will hate on you. No asian woman dont hate latinos, its just ur imagination<br>  <br>  Edit: WOW THAT GIRLS A RACIST LMAO!?! Down at the bottom|`|zTLCjUH5aa	moustaches are a turn off
AA11447210	Don't feel the need to label yourself...take the time to find out where your interest really lies. You didn't mention your age, and if you are a teen things may (or may not) change as you get older and have more experiences.<br>  <br>  Right now, if you are under 18 save sex for when you are legally responsible for the consequences. As for your emotions, see where they lead you. Everyone has preferences. We can choose to act on them or not, but we don't get to choose what they are.|`|23kap6Feaa	your a lesbian because you've never seen my penis
S8H5yYcoaa	Did you suggest the chat?  Based on the silence before this point and your mention of drama, my guess would be she's still hurting a little from last year, but definitely healing... she wants to eventually be close again, but right now it's too hard.  So she's asking you for space for now, which will help her get over the drama, and she's asking you to let her come to you rather than having you check in every few days or whatnot, which might put undue pressure on her, not good for healing.  Her coming to you when she is ready also lets her feel a little more in control of the situation, something she might need to feel if last year's drama was difficult for her to fix singlehandedly.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	sounds like she may have gotten out of a relationship. she doesn't sound like she was there with you in mind but from what you were telling me something was definetly bothering her and it likely wasn't you. i think she does like you but had something else on her mind at the time. give her some space or even ask her if there was anything wrong. it'll show her that you care about her well being.|`|7ROXROUxaa	it means she doesn't wanna be tied down right now<br>  but when she's ready to be in a relationship she will<br>  let you know|`|S8FjI00vaa	It means that she's not ready to get close to you right now, but when she is ready she will definitely let you know:).<br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION!

Don't go there.|`|HJrTuihcaa	I personally think that's rude, but that's just me.|`|Ba6SSkzBaa	It means leave her alone for a while, and she wants to get together with you...|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Something is up here and she is putting you off.  She is trying to be nice.  She could be involved with someone else right now and maybe she is thinking about getting out of the relationship she is in so she isn't ready to jump into anything else, too, it could be that, but at any rate she is putting you off.|`|G9831g5Baa	She sounds kinda stupid, and she shouldn't be going crazy like that on a first date.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	ok.... i really dont know whats going tru her head, because i dont know what the drama was.... but from what i get, she says she needs space, so leave her alone. dont call, dont talk. just leave her.<br>  the mere fact that she got there late and then rushed means you werent a priority.|`|bf7b1a1cc5c7e9655b75312968f51d3eaa	she simply means exactly wat she said. she needs time to think through some stuff but will contact u when she wants to get together again!<br>  hope this helps|`|KIGzbUOlaa	well basically, you have to stop trying to get in contact with her & stuff, for example, if your texting her & ringing her, stop. She wants time to think about stuff & she will talk to you when shes ready.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	That means she only showed up in person to make sure you understand that she doesn't want anything right now and if she does she will let you know. So it's probably not going to happen. Move on...it won't happen with her.|`|p82sIbAAaa	just that. girls arn't that complicated.|`|g2kP1aOaaa	"She's just not that into you."|`|FJyqZ3Qjaa	um...mabey shes just crazy...or shes having guy probs and wanted to talk to u...but mainly shes crazy...|`|3NdBYdlOaa	it means what she saids,just give her space and she will give you the okay when she's good and ready|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Oh, so you dated her.  Ic now.  Depending on your "drama" with her it may be that she has not gotten over whatever happened between you two.  She did make the effort to come & say "hi", but I am unsure as to why she would  come 15 minutes late & only stay for 5.  Maybe she had work or something came up, but she still made it so that is hard to say what her deal is.  If she told you more than once within 5 minutes that she needs more space, then she needs time to think... She may feel you are being too pushy or forward & she needs you to back up.  I would think that if she did come to see you then she is still interested just not ready for any kind of commitment or dating right now.|`|DXV5l417aa	that she is unsure if she should be wif u cuz mybe she has another guy she lykes and if she gets round u then u willl make her change her mind and not knwo if she can decidre who she wants|`|XQe8rlH7aa	Sounds to me that maybe going out for coffee was a bit much for her to handle given the "drama" that transpired last year.  <br>  <br>  Stating that she needs space gives the impression that speaking casually when you crossed paths was fine but more initmate conversation and relationship, whatever that may entail, is out of the questions right now.<br>  <br>  Stating she will initiate things when she's ready seems like she's stating she will be the agresser and pursue a more stable relationship.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped you out and hope that you all sort things out.|`|ek1193Qiaa	she likes you and she wants to be your friend but first she has some things she has to sort out on her own...probably some personal stuff but when she is ready she will talk to you|`|bssOhC9jaa	It means she wants to be alone and will call you when she is ready.|`|ffpdB1tzaa	She is saying in a somewhat firm way that she does not want to get back together with you.  She should have just out and out said this but she doesn't want to hurt your feelings.  I wouldn't worry about her since she can't even respect your time by showing up on time for your meetup.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry to have to answer this way, and I know that it probably isn't what you want to hear.  But she probably isn't worth your time.|`|vJvwYDGTaa	Basically shes trying to say in the nicest and indirect way possible...shes not interested! Us girls are always kind of confusing that way. We never want to say it directly to a sweet guy because we dont want to hurt him, or we dont want him to start rolling off on a tangent and making it harder. Give her, her space. the more you try to get close to her the more shes gonna push away. Thats a number one annoyance is when you want space and someoen doesnt give it to you. Good luck!|`|vFldqvN4aa	she means she doesnt have time to date right now but she'll ask you out when she has time and things arent so hectic|`|pbTN9xYlaa	shes saying she aint got time for you so you need to move on with your life.|`|Dowi63iuaa	I believe I would just give her space and see if she comes to you! She could be going through something and just doesn't want to be with someone right now. She may just need to be away from guys right now until she can work through something. Or maybe you need to talk to her about it?|`|qSbDZgQlaa	Everyone says that shes not ready and all thats doing is assuming things. I know that it will probably be awkward but the best thing that you can do is just straight up ask her. It will get rid of all the questioning and guessing. The best thing is to ask her straight up.|`|Ta24cVD5aa	i see that there is more to this story than u r saying..but to me i think she is seeing someone..maybe has a drug problem  idk..but u have to think the worst..she is troubled with something..but all u can do is be there when she calls u cuz i know u will..u seem like a nice guy|`|DI0a82Y7aa	it means she wants to date other people right now so give her time to explore. just wait a while and she'll come back.|`|fgsVyB0Naa	If i was in your place, I would interperate it as saying, " Im flattered that you like me, but i am not ready yet." I would think that she would contact you when she is.<br>  <br>  Its your choice if you want to wait for her or not. <br>  <br>  Hope i Helped!|`|ZX9HeOuyaa	she's not ready for dating, but she will start when she's ready?|`|5FbDXzr6aa	she dosnt like u<br>  but in the future maybe she will like you|`|cdEd2LK9aa	maybe she hasn't been over what happened last year and wanted to be your girlfriend but still not ready. . . she thinks that you like her. . .i think|`|nHC6hV7Haa	i think that she thinks you like her and she just wants to hook up later?|`|zsn7lrThaa	Leave her alone.

5fdgfNCRaa	You're right!<br>  Ends of relationships are brutal - no matter what the reason is. Especially if one of the people still loves the other.<br>  <br>  I think that people still fall in love because even if it hurts to end a relationship, they're optimistic about finding someone special to spend their life with.<br>  Even if the relationship ends, it's true that there were good times between the beginning and end.<br>  Sometimes it's just better to live in the moment and not worry about what happens in the future. Be happy that you're with someone who makes you happy, regardless of where you'll be in a few years. Plan for the future and know the possibilities of what could happen, but don't rob yourself of happiness now because you may not be happy forever.<br>  :)|`|PGPTbMJVaa	Love is a feeling that you make into a sprawling 42 room mansion that becomes authentic when validated.

You have to know that you might end up getting hurt in the end but maybe the pain really is worth it. Falling in love is the best thing that's ever happened to me and no matter what happens there will never be any regrets not regrets about falling in love anyway, I would have my heart broken a million times over if that means that I get to have at least one moment where the emotions between me and a guy are so strong that nothing could get in the way of our love. That's just me though.|`|E0PZoHMkaa	You ask the question as if it's something that can be avoided simply by refusing to fall.  Nobody "jumps" in love.  That would be an intentional act.  Falling in love is as simple as the implication........"falling".  You don't expect it, you might get hurt when you do it.  It may happen because you let your guard down.  After you do it you can swear that you'll never do it again.  But guess what?  You can't control it.  Not even when you seek it out.  You may think that you can make yourself fall in love.  But it can't be done.  Anything intentional is a jump.  Anything as surprising and completely out of control as love??..........that's falling!!!|`|J3baiqqhaa	i dont know man.

But there is a difference being IN love.  Weather you want to love someone or not doesn't matter when the love is real.  If you don't want to love someone, and you really don't, they weren't the one for you to begin with.  But if you try not to love someone, and you can't help but to, that's how you know it's real.  And if it's real, any pain that comes from it is worth it.  Because there is nothing in the world like being in love with someone.

AA10065812	???<br>  In twenty years of working with divorced and single fathers, I don't recommend it.  The failure rate is just too high.  In decades past, that might have been a viable option, but these days the divorce rate is just too high. My own mother has been married to my step father for 50 years.  They met on a Thursday and were married Saturday.  <br>  <a href="http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/?uc_full_date=20050619" rel="nofollow">http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/?uc_ful...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If the kids are grown, or even teenagers, that's a different matter.|`|dItZAwI2aa	as long as she has divorce papers and not just separated, if we click i'm not going anywhere.<br>  <br>  good luck and GOD bless.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Im divorced and have kids. It is on my list that she has to have been married and have kids. Sort of an experiance thing.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	It depends, for myself, I don't want to have any kids of my own.  The thing with single mothers is that if the condom slips or leaks, the guy is on the hook because as a general rule, single mothers probably won't have an abortion.<br>  <br>  So for guys who don't want kids, it's just not worth the risk, there's plenty of other women out there.  And plenty of guys for you who don't have a lot of choices and will gladly take that risk.|`|EENUWAP7aa	That would be an ultimate call for any man to pursue the relationship and love both the child and the Mother.<br>  <br>  We live in a world that for many a marriage has failed for various reasons, but a divorced woman can land another husband just as fast as a single woman.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You do realize you're asking this in the "marriage and divorced" section don't you? Most of these people are married and/or divorced. We expect people to have kids. Sorry but you aren't likely to get a good answer here.|`|AA12266564	I'm a guy who is divorced, so a divorced women isn't a big deal to me.  It happens these days unfortunately.  Having a kid a is a different story.  It just depends on what you want.  If you want a family, then you may not have an issue with a woman already having a kid.  Me personally, I'm not in that position just yet, so i tend to avoid the ones with kids, though i have considered it.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	I dated a girl while she was going through a divorce, and had 2 kids little ones 4 and 2. It didnt scare me at all, the dad was in and out of jail all the time. but we ended up getting married, its last for 7yrs. but what do most men feel, scared, some not wanting to became instant dads, but some guys like it. but you just have to find the ones that dont mind, and will be happy having a instant family life with you and the kids. good luck,|`|U2tkgYK6aa	it depends on the man, and the level of maturity he is at, I would not run the other way, in fact it would endear her even more to me, it is not always the case, but from my experience, single mothers are great to be with, they are hard working,responsible and devoted to their family, qualities that i love in a woman. if the conversation was good and the chemistry was right, a divorce and children would not put me off...|`|E0PZoHMkaa	No runnning.  No need for that.  Unless you are delusional and think that if she didn't have a kid you could be her white knight.  Look.....if she didn't have a kid, she'd WANT one.  From YOU.  Then you'd be paying child support while the next guy tried to figure this question out.  She may still want one from you You're ahead of the game.  Stay that way.  Be happy about that and don't marry her and don't don't don't get her pregnant!!|`|ijjpYG6Faa	all that matters is what feeling are there for that women, if she is divorced or not and if she has kids, then they would be our kids, again what matters is what feelings they have for eachother.|`|pYQpMT6iaa	Yes, proceed with caution -- if you're without children as a guy. May be different story if you're also divorced with children.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	Children or divorce makes no diff to me. I love the one I'm chasing and she has 2 children and 2 divorces........I think she.s perfect|`|AA10450505	Proceed with caution. See where this goes.
a7wuIVFsaa	Well I know how u feel, dude. My sis is also dating a guy of my age. I should have been happy. The guy is my a good friend of mine. But I'm am not. This happens speacialy if someone very close to you is loved by someone else very much. It's natural. U have to forget it and be happy about it!!|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Ohhh man I totally know what your talking about! As soon as friends start dating it's like this hole rips through the friendships. People start keeping secrets and things get awkward and frustrating. <br>  Especially when your friend gets the girl you liked, then it's like you feel like crap cause you think "well why him and not me" They spend more time alone with each other and it breaks the group up...|`|jZb5zMCvaa	its not wierd but it could be uncomfortable because the dynamics of the relationships have changed. if its getting too bad try to hang out with other people as well, its not worth getting bothered over. there are so many people out there.|`|mR9ydwz5aa	yeah its normal to feel awkward. it should go away.|`|EhEdOojOaa	No.  Why let it bother you?  They are the ones that are dating, not you.  Relax ;-)|`|sr7jX2wYaa	Expand your  horizons a little bit & get yourself a girlfriend,  You don't  need  to know  what they  talk about as far their  relationship  is concerned, that  is  private between  a couple.  If you  feel weird , maybe the other  girl left out does too, & maybe she has a thing  for you, so you might  want to ask her out so you all still fit in*|`|AA11085356	Perhaps you are jealous... Talk to you friends about it, it might help.
yhT2VuUVaa	you should confess because i didnt know my friend had a crush on who i was dating and she told me and i told her i was sorry and she just said she could deal with it and i understood. i didnt yell at her for liking my man!! its okay!|`|1PqbJzsnaa	focus on your school work ~ especially the spelling and grammar.|`|0TNyUg6Maa	first of all, you should not  have discussed the young lady with your so-called friend. And to tell you the truth he's really not your friend, knowing that you had the hots for the young lady. And he's really rubbing it in your face. If i was you i would cut him, and her off. the first thing comes that comes to my mind is tha he's a sucker for that one.|`|nALesYKvaa	love is always predominant. depending on her personality, it may just be a one time thing. have some confidence in yourself. girls love it when guys express how they feel, if u have feelings for her, shed want to know.

Or maybe he'll think that if he's not accepted by your mum its not worth it. However he may decide he loves you too much to end it.<br>  <br>  Theres 2 people in a relationship.

YOU WHO YELL ***** AT YOUR MOTHER......if you were my kid and you said that...no one would ever see you again.  NEVER!  You would be in some boot camp the rest of your life...learning how to grow up!   NO child should be as disrespectful as you are here.  YOu should all be ashamed and thanking God you have parents that love you.  You are all selfish little babies demanding your own way pitching fits.   Learn to deal with life as an adult and maybe your parents will treat you more like one.<br>  <br>  Dump him.  You are 15..how are you going to stand up to your parents.  You will eventually lose...and there will be many problems between your parents and you..including trust issues.  You do not want to grow up without your parents TRUSTING you.  <br>  <br>  There has to be a reason she doesn't want you to see him...usually mom's are right.  Listen to her!<br>  <br>  I am sorry...but your life is HERS right now...and I am sure she has told you why she disagrees with this.  We cannot tell you to go against your mother...that would be wrong.  She has a side too...and as unreasonable as you think it is...that is your mother and she would give her life for you....would your boyfriend?  I guarantee you...your mother would always put you first....cherish that..and love her for her unconditional love.  Your boyfriend is just a blink in your lifetime right now...it won't last.  Let it go.|`|0qSpreVyaa	You'd dump the guy just because your mother says you can't see him?!!! What happened to the rebel in you! Gosh!<br>  <br>  If you like the guy stay with him! It's your life under your mother's rules! But rules are meant to be broken occasionally... right? ; )|`|eKxPSMolaa	so you think you will be with him forever? i don't know but i think that your mom will always be around, but he may not be.|`|wJGQtHuhaa	Make her meet him then see what she says. If her answer is no then secretly date. if yes then go out with him.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	well you should introduce him to your mom and tell him to be on his best behavior get your mom to accept him<br>  <br>  i had the same problem with my mom not liking my bfs so at first i didnt care and just ignored her but that made it worse cuz she started to think i was acting like that cuz of my bfs so yea just let her meet him and if she still doesn't like him then just tell her face to face that you really like him and that you dont want to leave him and give her some good reasons why you want to stay with him............|`|NtCya5NYaa	if you really like with him then be with him. maybe your mom sees something you dont, sometimes love has blinders and we only see what we want to see. maybe your mom doesnt think your old enough to be dating? if so ask your mom and see if you can come to a compromise and convince her you are ready for the responsiblity of being in a relationship.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	usually when parents dont like a boy, theyre right, unless its some discrimination having to do with racial or social stats. <br>  do whatever you like, after all, they cant really tell you who you like. if you think hes great, go for it, just dont be with him to piss off your parents. itll make them trust you less.|`|AA10529674	Maybe your mom has her reasons for not liking or trusting your boyfriend. She is obviously doing that because she wants to protect you. You're young and you'll meet more guys. You have plenty of time for boyfriends.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	boi friend? lool. Umm, if you like him stay with him duh if you don't dump him.|`|hEFthejvaa	just tell him about you're mom, he should understand.|`|mR9ydwz5aa	do you still like him? stay with him.|`|wnr9S9kuaa	Stay with him, because all that matters is that you like him.  not your mom's opinion.  So how old are you if your mom won't let you see him?  As long as he's a good guy then stay with him.  Maybe that relationship will last so long that by the time you're out of the house you'll still be with him.  Also, maybe even try to get your mom worried about the situation by threatening not to eat or talk to her if you don't get to see him.  Then secretly eat, but small amounts of food that will keep you skinny and strong and ignore her then she'll probably get really worried and let you go back and hangout with him again.  It all depends on what you think and if your mom has a good reason not to let you see him.|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	ask your self, do you really like him, isn't just your mom, why does ur mom don't let you see him, is there a bad reason for that? well you should talk to your mom, tell her how you feel and what you think, the most important thing is show her, she should trust you, and you won't let anything bad happen .............|`|tWvM6M0raa	if you really like him then stay with him<br>  <br>  is there a reason your mum won't let you see him anymore, if she has a really good reason then i would listen to her<br>  but if she has no reason or says your age then you should stay with him<br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjTnwtkCNUn89_n52cY3H7bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222165229AAnifXI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|PP1KswnAaa	stay with him if you like him your mum has no control over your personal life so its yours to enjoy so enjoy it while you can|`|40Ow9B1maa	well if you really like him (ik im a dude but o well) then go b ehind your moms back and still see him tel your mom your going out with your friends or somethi nto the movies and then go wit him|`|fJQFH3Woaa	dump him, your young it's not some serious thing anyways<br>  you have plenty time to find a guy right for you with your moms approval|`|WQcxODKLaa	if you really like him, you wouldn't care what your mom thinks .|`|g3I4zblPaa	If his mom hates you you should dump him.

First of all, spelling is a very important thing in life. Respect it. Second of all, one question mark will suffice.<br>  <br>  Now, to address your question. If your mother says that you can't see this boy, then she probably has a reasonable reason. Is it because there is a large age difference between the two of you? Have you gotten into more trouble since you started dating him?<br>  <br>  Ask your mother why you can't see him, then if you think she has a point, break up. If you think she's crazy, stay with him. But be prepared for any consequences she feels are necessary for you disobeying her.|`|7lpFlUDTaa	If your mom won't let you see him it's either because she's uber controlling, or he's obviously a loser.  <br>  <br>  You have to look at the relationship from her perspective....why do you think she won't let you see him anymore.  If it's a good reason then I would trust her judgment.  Remember, mothers usually just want to look out for you. <br>  <br>  To be honest, guys come and go, but your mom is probably the only one you get, so think about what the consequences will be with her if you disobey her.|`|AA12133900	Why does your mom not want you to see him? If its for the reason that your too young for a boyfriend then try talking to her. Tell her how you feel. If you really like this kid then don't dump him! If what you two feel for each other is strong then you both can make it work no matter what comes between you two. If its because she doesnt like him; ask her why & listen & judge. she is alot older & she knows whats good for her daughter. Good luck & talk to your mom.|`|igztwLPBaa	Both ny parents didn't agree with my bf..n demanded for me to break up with him..but i loved him and it was too late for anyone to change my mind.sometimes you have to follow your heart..even if it means disobeying the ones that truly love you...and if he's a good guy he will realize the sacrifice you have made for him and cherish you even more...now 3 year has passed and IM with the same guy..and my mom has welcomed him into the family with open arms.becausee she realized how deep my love was for this one boy..i think her not wanting us togetherOnlyy made us fight harder for each other and made us waymuchs stronger..<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|16b57d87abae662592625be18e53f5eeaa	if you think your mom has good reason to not like this boy and is truly looking out for you in all the right ways, then follow what she says. if you think otherwise, keep him.  sometimes parents are really just looking out for your well being, and other times they just don't know any other way to keep control of their children.  do what feels right.|`|nXZwvsYhaa	if you love him... stay with him.

AA11739944	If you're a grown woman why are you living with your mother? You're an adult right? get a job, move out and do what the hell you want. Oh, that's right...you can't get a job cause YOU'RE A CHILD. You're 13 years old. <br>  you're friends mothers don't give them any rules? Do they have children yet? If they don't, it's a miracle. Don't try to grow up too fast. You'll be sorry.<br>  Your mother makes you go to bed at a reasonable hour, won't let you stay out late, and doesn't let you have a boyfriend. Sounds like she's a very good mother. You should be happy you have a mother that gives a damn about you.|`|RyYumX0Aaa	Firstly at 13, you're not where near being a grown woman-you may feel like you know everything about the world but unfortunately you have no idea!<br>  Secondly, mothers never stop treating you like a child, yes slowly the rules will start to diminish and she will give you a wee bit more freedom but at the end of the day your still going to be her child.<br>  <br>  All you can do, if you want more freedom, is talk to her. Show her you are mature by staying calm and coming to an agreement. <br>  But always remember your mother being over protective is a sign of caring, she loves you she doesn't want any harm to come to you, she's not enforcing these rules to be the bad guy.<br>  <br>  I am 19 and i am no where near being a fully grown woman, i have a lot to learn and a lot of time to go before i even want to be! Me and my mum talked things through and i am thankful for her protectiveness everyday!|`|DzunYgWOaa	Your haven't figure ir out yet, but your mom is the cool one,she gives you rules and boundaries because she loves and cares about you, you say your friends get to do whatever they want, maybe their mom doesn't care about them. Your only 13, you have a ways to go before you are a grown women. Good luck, and thank god you have a mother that cares about you.|`|VygBNA0Waa	omg your mum loves you<br>  omg your mum wants to know that you are ok<br>  omg your friends mum wishes there daughter would go to the mall and never come home<br>  omg how good is your mum<br>  omg she wants you to grow into a really nice person and not a dirty whore|`|W4sNRgs3aa	13?! you are not a grown woman..little girl<br>  13 year olds are so annoying,you think your so grown because your age has the word "teen" in it.I don't like being mean,but I don't like your attitude.|`|WrbqCprHaa	im 14 and I have to be in bed by nine. Ive never had a gaming console or a decent tv. i have to tidy my house and do work most sundays, and being 13 definitly isnt grown up.<br>  deal with it.<br>  no im not catholic|`|xY9xprsEaa	wait till ur 18, then she cant stop u, then have the life u wish u had.|`|bfQfeUq5aa	I think she is being over protective....... I'm not allowed to have a BF either <br>  She is just protecting u fform any dangers out there<br>  She is just ding all this for your own good!<br>  Hope I helped.|`|1dLGkSGQaa	My Mom was super overprotective too. <br>  <br>  Can you talk to her about making some compromises with you?  Like maybe she won't budge on the 7pm curfew, but she would let you have a boyfriend if she knew there was someone you really liked.  Write down all the things you want and show her the list and then maybe your 3 most important things you want and see if she's willing to meet you halfway on ANYthing at all. <br>  <br>  Obviously approach this conversation calmly and like the adult you want her to see you as.  She obviously won't give you everything you want, but maybe she'll move the 7pm time to 9pm or let you stay up until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays since they're not school nights.  They're small things, but it  could prove she's willing to talk to you about how you feel any make some compromises.  Then once you prove you can handle those few small changes, she might be ready to make more changes a month or two from now.<br>  <br>  It's a slow process with an overprotective parent, but so much better than arguing with her all the time or rebelling and having a bad relationship with her for years.  She really loves you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FoDDa8TNaa	I'm 13 too.<br>  Allowed to stay out as long as i want,<br>  Go to the mall without telling my parents,<br>  Go to bed when i want,<br>  Just tell your mom that you want to live your life, not be stuck in home all day, compare you to your friends, and just keep bugging her about it,,, it works for me.|`|AA10283262	Don't worry about having a cool mom. Be glad she's a mother who cares about your well being. Try to look at things from her side. Please imagine how your friends parents will feel if something bad should happen. Hang in there and prove your to your mom you're responsible. Do your chores and homework without being told. Help mom without her asking. Prove you're worthy of her trust and, she'll probably loosen up!|`|AA10879298	im 13 to and trust me ur not a grown woman far from it and im speaking for myself to cuz i think the same sh*t but she just wants the best for u maybe she made some mistakes in life she dosn"t want you to make sit down and talk to ur mom about it and tell her how you feel !!!<3|`|WyDsza2Faa	My advice print this off keep it until you have a 13 year old of your own then you may be able to see where your mum is coming from. Just becasue you have reached puberty doesnt mean your a woman. Your 13 my advice concentrate on school dont worry about boys you"ll soon realise they are all immature little root rats and at that age that is all they really want. Not kidding!!!|`|f9j0WH7eaa	well just ask her if she needs help, dont give her an attitude thats the worst thing you can do, do extra things around the house and try spending some time with her but wen u  talk to her be really nice and no attitude cause it will ruin every thing|`|aMvMklMbaa	Wow.. You Have better rules than i did when i was 13.<br>  Im 18. Haha i still have curfew even though its not really their choice.. but they just do anyways.<br>  Don't sweat it.. your LUCKY!|`|VNbmDjCRaa	try talking with your mom . prove to your mom that your are mature|`|atrObg5saa	you are still a kid|`|kyL7UNeRaa	umm 13 isn't that old and you definitely are not a grown woman..|`|lfIlQTCIaa	maybe you should have a little talk with ur mom tell her to give u some space.. & she will understand =] <br>  <br>  good luck|`|zdu3gh8jaa	What should you do? Hmm - let me think. How about telling your mum how cool she actually is and thank her for loving you enough to care and waste precious mental energy worrying about your health and welfare? I think that would be good for starters. I was not allowed out to the shopping malls until I was 16, I could only go after dinner on saturdays ( about 1.30pm ) and I had to be back home for 4pm. At the age of 20, I still had to be in the house by 9pm and on saturday I could have until 10pm. I had to give exact places where I could be found and how I intended to get both to wherever I was going and how I would get back home. At 20 I was a grown woman, yet I was still expected to stick to the rules and why? Because I was loved and cared for. Yes my mum was extremely over protective and perhaps she could have given me more lee way, but living by her rules has never ever brought me harm.<br>  At 13 you are not a grown woman, you are still a developing child if not physically, you are mentally and emotionally. How is your mum meant to look out for you if she let's you do what you want whenever you want? No doubt your mum wants you to be safe and grow into a respectful and well balanced young lady - don't be in any rush to grow up so quickly, being an adult is not half as much fun as it looks.|`|FXCoGD44aa	You are not a grown woman, you are still a kid. When I was 13, I had the same rules... and so will my daughter someday.<br>  <br>  It's hard to realize now, but everything your parents do for you is done for a reason. The trouble with a lot of kids and teens these days is that they are literally growing up too fast.<br>  <br>  Here's what you can do. Sit down and have a chat with your mom. Ask her what you can do to earn more freedom from her. Maybe offer something like helping out more around the house, or trying harder in school. The idea is to negotiate a deal. If she gives you some slack, respect it and hold up your end of the bargain to assure that you can do it again in the future. If she asks you to call and check in at whatever time, do it. This builds trust. Try that - I bet it will work better than complaining and saying, "You never let me do anything."|`|YCUJMvWQaa	well then you should let her see that your a responsable girl , show her that you know your responsible and trustworthy , and with that little by little she will let you go freely, but 13 is still young , so parents are problaby doing whats best for you cause there are a lot of guys out there who treat girls bad, so understand your parents and hopefully theyll understand you =]<br>  <br>  -hope i helped takecare|`|tjImPvzOaa	"wont even let me go to the mall with my friends"<br>  "I cant even stay up past 10pm"<br>  "I have to be home before 7pm"<br>  <br>  I feel so bad for you, seriously.|`|Msd9PiRGaa	13. <br>  <br>  Meredith, that is my final answer.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	when you stop acting like one.......
28UJA6FQaa	the only way to actually stop "thinking" about them. is to move on?<br>  they may sound a little cliche right now, but soon you will.<br>  trust me, i've been in your shoes. i know how you feeeeeel :)<br>  but no matter what he'll come across your mind here & there. but in order to stop thinking about them, is to think about someone else. & that kinda thing isnt forced. one day you'll meet someone eles & you'll think about that person more & more& lesss & less of your ex, without even thinking about it :)|`|D3bLcWNsaa	Go to the beach, and go guy seeking. Once you find a new guy your ex won't cross your mind. So basically the only way to forget about him is to find someone else.
haCssg2Laa	i think you have had your priorities right<br>  <br>  you are obviously a well educated young man<br>  there is no shame in that<br>  you come across as a nice considerate guy, and you admit you are shy, that's what is holding you back. Girls like a guy who, isn't wild, but isn't shy either, and as you are shy, girls will think you are not interested, and so they remain on friends only terms with you. Not being able to drive is neither here nor there, doesn't factor into it at all,<br>  you need to assert yourself a little, I cannot promise every girl you ask out will say yes, and we all fear rejection, that's human nature, but all those teens who have a relationship you mention, took the plunge, and they will also have had rejection, when it happens, it probably knocks you a little, but like every knock in life, you get back up, dust yourself off, and start again<br>  you will eventually meet a girl who will ask you out, but why wait?<br>  seriously, what is the worst that happens, she says no, so what? life is too short to stress over the little things, pick your battles to stress, ones that are worth stressing about<br>  <br>  life is for living, go grab it!|`|hz9BhQ7Baa	1.) You put out a very nice description about yourself.  That's a terrific start.<br>  <br>  2.) The only way you get over fears is facing them.  Get behind the wheel a lot, no matter how scary it's going to feel.<br>  <br>  3.) I can't help you more with how to start dating since I don't know you at all, but perhaps other answers can help you better.|`|iBi1GuDKaa	DEFINITLY. U R ******. DID U SEE 40 YR OLD VIRGIN. ITS A WRAP. U MIGHT BE GAY|`|A7nIADxgaa	Go to bars, clubs, hang out with friends, have fun and be open to people.<br>  <br>  Stop being shy, it won't bring you anywhere because as you see, you seem like a great guy and at 22 you haven't had a gf yet.|`|0bGDcN0Iaa	u might be gay i think, and learn how to drive you can have gay sex in the back seat of the car

M63kq3AYaa	He's gay or bisexual.<br>  Straight men don't experiment.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Good lord...|`|sNr9Od89aa	maybe he's bisexual. have a talk with him and tell him you feel uncomfortable.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Well, I am sure this incident has affected him, but I think it's a bit soon to<br>  say he's gay.<br>  He may be bisexual, or he may just have some repression issues associated w/this earlier incident.<br>  He was a child -- it's not his fault...<br>  I think it shows real character that he even told you that -- He had no<br>  real obligation to do so...|`|wJcpjDLUaa	until you see him with a man, trust him.  my boyfriend likes cher, whitney houston, and celine dion.  he loves watching chick flicks with me.  i would just have a good time.  don't let it get to you hon.  if he was gay, you'd know it.  and just because he let another guy go down on him doesn't mean he's gay.  everyone experiments, some just go further than others.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	If he let a guy blow him, he is already gay. All of the other stuff you said about Celine Dion, Chick Flicks and being sensitive are all just icing on the cake.<br>  <br>  Unless you want to wake up with a 150 pound full blown fruitcake one day, I would run far, far away.|`|UmidemI6aa	Maybe he is bisexual.|`|rJgrwIodaa	He could definitely be bi, but he is dating you.  That means he likes you.  You have the proof that he's attracted to you sexually.  Have a great time and enjoy the fact that he's sensitive, a great listener, and he does sweet things.  Maybe even some day you can talk about hot guys with him.  It's not a curse, it's a blessing.  The important thing is to listen to him and believe what he tells you.  You are dating him, you should trust him.|`|NJ9Ytksraa	He's probably bi (bisexual, meaning that he is interested in both sexes, men and women)|`|y681j1XKaa	forget it babe, he sounds like me ;) <br>  just a phase, i thought i was when i was younger but then we hit puberty and guys got manly. sensitive guys ftw|`|gniKjoG8aa	He'll probably end up getting AIDS and giving it to you...|`|dx9AZ16Paa	um gross.|`|pvosPN40aa	its a very very mad world|`|2tnXJmfkaa	A lot of men actually do like Celine Dion but the chick flicks hmm... maybe he just likes the humour. You say that when he was young he explored with another boy well dont we all when we are young? he was probably experimenting. If he says he isnt gay then your job as his girlfriend is to believe him. It does sound to me like he is a bisexual but there is nothing wrong with that as long as he is physically attracted to you then there is nothing to worry about. However you need to make sure that he isnt surpressing his gay feelings, Im guessing by the way you talk about him that you really do care for him so you want him to be happy. Just keep a close eye on him but not so close as to make him nervous and just go with the flow. if he does turn out gay there is no reason that you cant be friends (: and if hes bisexual then there really isnt a problem you get the best of both worlds a gorgeous guy who loves you and who is in touch with his femine side =D<br>  <br>  x|`|crbzVL0Haa	A man doesn't have to be tough, and closed emotionally to be a man. So what if he has a few feminine attributes, and has experimented with sexuality? That doesn't mean he's gay, and if you love him, then so be it. If he returns your feels, calm down.<br>  <br>  Not all straight men have to be terrifyingly masculine, you know. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to the two of you.|`|hpcQI5Viaa	maybe he really is just the guy of your dreams... every guy has their weird little quirks. and if you've had the discussion with him and everything ( and he seemes sincere about it when he answered), then you should be safe. if he starts dressing weird or something then, maybe you should remind him? lol just be on the look-out for other weird things and if you're really freaked by it or someone else notices or something maybe it's time to end it?<br>  good luck!|`|1W7Endxtaa	you're just going to have to trust him. if he really loves you, he won't lie to you. and maybe he's bi..oh well, if he's gay, it's no your fault either. just...trust him. that's all you can do. and obviously he seems to be in love with you, so i don't see anything to worry about. he was pobably curious when he was younger (my ex had a similar expierience, but he's straight)|`|7SIaeZVYaa	well obviously he isn't gay if he's attractive to you lol. and the reason why he watches chick flicks is because he's sensitive. my dad watches chick flicks too and he isn't gay (how do you think i got her). well i hoped that helped!|`|9MSsOwaFaa	I think u shouldd just forget about it. he might like chick flicks and stuff but he just sounds like a rlly sweet guy and u should hold on to him.. and the fact a guy went down on him .well... we all do stupid things at some point in our lives..|`|ODblt2gTaa	he let another guy go down on him.....this WILL happen again...<br>  but you have options.....either dump him or get used to his lifestyle and be prepared to participate in 3somes....|`|NBnOhmOiaa	maybe hes a bisexual|`|9nmkoJgYaa	90% chance he's bi... Live with it.|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	You ever think he may be bi? That's a possibility too.<br>  And maybe he told you that because he wanted you to know something personal about him.. did you comfort him, or were you grossed out and accused him of being gay? I think he may have been looking for comfort.. if you didn't give him that, that's pretty bad.<br>  <br>  Just because a guy isn't a jerk doesn't mean he's gay. And just because he likes chick flicks doesn't mean he's gay either. My boyfriend watches Disney movies with me and he seems to (or at least pretends to) like them.<br>  Don't keep confronting him about it. He could get annoyed and break up with you because of that.

Its not fair to you.|`|4rs0KXiTaa	give him a chance. maybe you'll come around.|`|oaVhxc8caa	Dump him anyways if you dont feel the same.|`|PK5Elowdaa	Don't listen to the girl above. In all honesty you're doing the right thing by breaking it up with him. In order for a relationship to work, you must be 100% sure you want to be with that person. There's no time to string anyone along while you're being indecisive. Giving a guy a date while you're confused is like giving him false hope. Don't be cruel. Cut it short and make it clear. Save the both of you time and trouble. Search your heart and stay true to it. If you have to ask yourself, should you break up with him,  then you really aren't fit to be with him. If you like someone, you wouldn't have to second guess. <br>  <br>  <br>  -The Guy Expert|`|yzsopSvDaa	Are you going on a date?

DbyvTE4laa	find some kind of common ground , <br>  something u can relate 2,<br>  something u both like to do,<br>  then u if hit it of suggest u meet up again sometime and go from there|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	i agree with the first answer. neighbors can be a good source of entertainment, not to mention you meet their friends, and their friends... bla bla bla. you can also do activities and meet people like that. like a sport (or, well, lets say art class, being as to how your child is very young) your child plays, talk to the other parents. im not sure where you live, but in places like california and new york there are always cool things to do outside on the weekends, and you can usually meet lots of people like that! bottom line is, you cant be shy!|`|Dowi63iuaa	Try and talk to your neighbors. Have get togethers at your house. Like, invite your neighbors and tell them they could bring some of their friends too. And you could have food, drinks, and things like that. Not a "party" just friends getting together and talking.|`|Lb6Y7xlnaa	hmmm.. you could enroll your little boy in a nice program and maybe you'll get to know the other parents.. you could also come on Yahoo and search for events going on in your city.. you'll make new friends!|`|rY1SVpbTaa	Try to find a club that has what you like and join it
W6LGsQC8aa	You were in the right, she was in the wrong.<br>  <br>  This girl seems like a real attention seeker, and NOT worth your valuable time.<br>  <br>  I would be PISSED if my boyfriend wanted to go to prom with someone else...<br>  <br>  She seems really immature too, just move on, tell her you aren't into her or how she's acting and just end it!<br>  <br>  I'm sure you can find a better girl to go to prom with...|`|WadeWRahaa	shes not worth it<br>  dump her|`|K71ZlPWgaa	I read all that and I don't have an answer!!! Look act really nice 2 her buy her flowers, chocolates something shell like. Do not mention the prom until she acts fine again. If you are good at singing or a awesome guitarists write her a song<br>  works a charm<br>  trust me|`|tuXBPrjsaa	shes controling you! this is NOT okay. i would break up with her immediatley omg my boyfriend would have killed me. dont let her do that to you be like listen man, if you gonna go with someone else than so am i maybe we just shouldnt even date no more if we cant go to our own prom together i might as well find someone else and someone else who actually wants to go with me.<br>  <br>  please listen to me im a girl i know. and this is absalutly rediculous i cant believe this girl. no no no its wrong!<br>  <br>  as for me. i had the worst prom ever. on my prom i caught my boyfriend cheating on me about 2 weeks prior and i had to break up with him so we never went to prom. had a dress and everything. it sucked prom was my worst nightmare. because i broke up with him he went with someone else and i didnt go at all.|`|62gMbgb1aa	i think you are a very god guy, you've waited more than you should, if your girlfriend think you are controlling her when you dont agree she is go to a party or a prom with some1 else, than how a god wife/or lover/or gf/or partner is she? and than she say "fine i will go with you"?!<br>  f i were you i wouldlet her go with the one she wants to and pick another friend to go to the party and continue my life as if nother has really happened ! don't be easy man ... you are still in the beginning, a girl just give her best at the beginning, so what could she be hiding for the rest of your life!!!|`|M8MlviOFaa	True, im on your side on this one buddy. But logically, figure if shes going with you or the other guy. If shes going with him. DONT SWEAT IT! atleast dont show it. Thats who she wants to go with, (since she feels single in all). She doesnt want to have a special moment with her BF at prom, she'd rather have it with another.<br>  <br>  If thats the case, let her go. Find another Prom Date, and look like your happy! Dont fake the funk, She wants to go with HIM, so be it. YOU go with someone else! <br>  <br>  Figure out if you guys are even together! If she thinks your trying to control her, LET HER DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS. Trust me, its hard, but do it. In the meantime, do your own thing. the world only gets harder my friend, so tough it out. Be a rightous guy because you know YOU are worth more than this. as a MAN do what you gotta do.<br>  <br>  You may still be in highschool, but stop chasing her cuz she'll only keep running away. Just stop and chill, and show that you dont have a problem in the world, your happy kickin it with your boys, and surround yourself with pretty girls. BECAUSE SHE CANT HAVE EVERYTHING, its unfair.<br>  <br>  Jealousy is your weapon, and its a fair tool. But what im trying to say is be genuine about it. The goal is to make her feel morally wrong without any words. she'll run back to you if she really cares about you. If she doesnt, then no matter what you did the right thing, cuz shes not the one.<br>  <br>  Say she does come back, yet you feel cheated that she can easily go from HIM and then back to YOU. Then its up to you to decide whether shes worth it or not.<br>  <br>  This whole thing is a long process, but Prom is months away I assume, so you have time. Trust me, Peoples true colors come out toward the end of the school year.. Just play it cool and do your own thing. She'll miss you and run back to you. Just stop playing her game cause its a childs game, and your more mature than that.|`|OSSRoUs2aa	Sweet Heart!<br>  I can totally understand why you are confused. She should have told the senior that she had gotten a boyfriend and it was only proper for her to go with you instead of him. How can you guys be going out and not talking. She has no right to be upset, but you do becuase she is your girlfriend and she is treating you like a brick. I would break up with her if I were you because with her wanting to go to prom with the other guy even though she planned it ahead it is kinda like she doesn't care. I know it is hard to read, but like if she doesn't care then you need to break up with her so you don't get hurt more than what you already are. Then I would go and find another girl you think is kinda cute or like and ask her to prom. =]<br>  Enjoy prom night with out her...<br>  Hope This Helps!!|`|zih6UH0laa	well confused guys,<br>  talk it out...<br>  and dont write so much<br>  it makes my head all woozy|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	i dont think she likes u|`|9WHPtn3paa	If your girl izz going to the prom wit someone else dont go wit another girl cuz 2 wrongs dont make a right just let  her do her, but wen prom is over and she tries to *** bac to you dont fall for it cuz if she really loved you she would not have went with some other guy she would have went with you, you dont have to go wit another girl to get even cuz leaving her alone after prom is over is gonna show her that she rally messed up, so just do you, leave her alone|`|BbaR8Hhqaa	I know that you dont want to do this, but i would say dump her. I mean, HELLO newsflash to her, you guys have been together since OCTOBER. no dip your going to go to prom together. gawsh, she is a jerk for doing that to you. im so sorry. you WILL find a better girl.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|FzyxiS4waa	hands down you are totally correct out of respect she should have warned you and told the guy she has a boyfriend and it'll will definitely look wrong if she went with him.....BUT since she didn't she has no respect for you...i may be wrong but try talking it out and tell her how your not trying to control her life its just kind of crazy that shes thinking of going to prom with someone else knowing that she has you.....and ask her how would she feel if she wanted to spend that night with you and you totally blew her off saying that you've got that night with someone else because they answered me first before i got with you.........idk just turn the tables and make her think|`|Nc7clhzIaa	First of all, she should have told you that she made the commitment with the other guy ahead of time.  However, if a girl is truly crazy about you, she would have just told the guy a long time ago that she can't b/c she is very much involved with you & would like to go with you.  Sounds like she didn't know if ya'll were still goin to be together by prom time & didn't wanna leave herself empty handed by cancelling on the guy, which is UNFAIR to you no matter what.  She is treating you wrong.  I would not put up with her attitude passing you up to talk to her friends, acting like she is single on myspace, & saying that she will go to prom with you only b/c you want her to.   Seems like she is totally walking all over you.  And yes you are so right when you say that Prom night should be for a bf/gf only.  No doubt.  She is being selfish.  Go find another date & tell her you are done!|`|kSFBMI6vaa	DUMP HER!!!!! she seems like she's a total slut and just used you to have a bf. she's not worth the heartache so find someone else. she's seems like a spoiled brat who gets what she wants when she wants it so dont pay attention to her if she talks all sweet to you again and says she's sorry. ignore her and find someone good for you. she obviously wants to be single. sorry dude but letting her go is the best thing|`|wdbwl9l6aa	First off I think your girlfriend is an idiot no offense. She is a ***** I'm sorry but I've got to give you the raw fact. I think you were right in what you did by telling her how you feel about the situation. The attitude problem from her doesn't even make any sense in the situation or argument. You shouldn't have backed down by telling her she can go with him. She is doing it in disregards to your feelings plus it seems as if she has got the reins in that relationship. You deserve better. She is treating you like dog **** and you mustn't stand by and let her. You're the man you must be able to put your foot down on some things plus she must be able to respect your feelings and opinions. You seem like a pretty sweet person but don't let her take advantage of that and walk all you like a mat. If you can't reason with her then break up with her to let her know that you're serious about your decisions. Whatever you see in her I hope that is enough but not enough to blind you from her faults because love can be a dangerous thing. I hope you two can work it out if not please follow my advice.|`|54xJpA3Yaa	Dump her. she is a retard. its as simple as that. let her know she screwed up big time and dont take her back. if she is insolent enough to do that, than you owe it to yourself to get rid of her and find someone better.|`|WnqSaVWmaa	Just imagine,  is this is the way she is going to act now, just imagine later on.  Sorry, but she doesn't care about you.  Just look for someone else to go to the prom.  You still have plenty of time.b|`|9mQC5Vihaa	Dude she wont be your girl friend in two years anyway, who cares. Take her sister to the prom.|`|l3Gv75cyaa	awwwwwww man look dude uh she is missin out and u should totally dump her a** uhh try to find some on e else to go to prom with <br>  get her mad|`|NJrkgBaWaa	You have to talk to her or her friends what she is feeling because she obv. Wont tell you.|`|QbwtIVpDaa	She's not worth your time. Stop wasting it on her.|`|3N5onOZraa	Yea man you're completely right.  But what can you do?  Girls don't like to be controlled though, and she was probably looking forward to showing off to her friends that she's going to prom with a senior, which i kno is shallow of her but she's in high school, it happens.  All you can do is show her a great time at prom, don't be insecure and ask her for anything anymore.  Just be confident, act like you could get it from anyone at anytime and she's just lucky to be on your arm, and don't sweat her stupid myspace comments because if it's what she really felt she would've kept it to herself or just told you.  She's trying to get to you.  Don't let her win!|`|B6ngUnb2aa	Wow... Dont worry dude, you arent at all in the wrong here. I think your girlfriend is kinda immature (no offense) because not only is she going with another guy to prom when she should be going with you, but she doesnt understand why you would get upset about that. Who cares if she planned on going with him before she started dating you, if you started dating in october that was a long time ago... You have every right to want her to go to prom with you. If she really cares about you, she shouldnt want to go with another guy to prom over you, and she shouldnt have even considered it, or made you feel bad for wanting her to go with you. I really dont know what you should do.. Like I said she sounds immature to me, so talking to her about it probably isnt going to do much cuz it sounds like youve already done that. Maybe you should just take someone else to prom and see how she feels about that. Good luck with it I hope it works out how you want it to!|`|BVVxH7UKaa	It sounds like she is being really immature. Let her do what she wants. I know it is hard but you should find someone to go with that will make you happy. You don't want to go with someone that acts like that to you. don't make it to easy. The general rule of thumb here is that girls want what they can't have.|`|RUD2N3Sqaa	dude i can help but u have to tell me how old u guys are first, anyways she is completly out of line , i hate to say this but try to resist the **** she says to u , let her win the fight even if it hurts u, and if she didnt tell u this b4 then, she might like him but choose u to be ur girlfriend because she didnt think shed stand a chance to have a relationship with the DUDE that u say she wants to go with , i really need to know how much time u guys were together n the age of u guys , i can give u more info by then , ive had experience wit gurls alooooot , i ve been cheated on , left behind nd lied to so i know wat a kick to the balls and heart feels so how old r u n her????? i wana help u=)|`|X6ipvO1xaa	ok, if you two are really going out, then she shouldnt be going out with another guy. so u arent at fault here. she is just doing this to get attention, or she really wanted to go with the other guy. but now she is playing dumb and acting like nothing ever happened? thats just wrong. you need to talk things through with her. u might end up not even wanting to go with her anymore. but either way, u need to ask her what she really wants.|`|b53k0EZkaa	WTF you freaking loser! your not freaking married let her have her freaking space! that question just pisses me off bc my sister used to fight with her current boyfriend bc he was controlling her for whoever she hung out that was bad and she wud cry! but dont try to tell her in a whiney way that she shud go with him say im sry for that stuff and you cud go with that guy! goshhh!|`|bt2tl4staa	Well if she's really good friends with the guy you should just let her go.  I mean you want her happy, right?  If you think she has extra feelings for the guy or something, then you should tell her.  Tell her exactly how you feel about it.  It's always best to tell the truth.  Or if you have friends that are going to prom you should tell them to keep an eye out and if anything happens just to tell you.  And if something does, just end it, if not, then you know you can trust her.|`|d9xIDrySaa	You're definitely right! I dont know what her problem is, You sound like a GREAT guy! I'd be happy to be with you myself, she must just be confused about something or .. idk. Maybe she's having second thoughts about your relationship and using this as an excuse to get you to break up with her. I think you either need to try confronting her about it again, or dumping her. she doesnt seem worth your time. <br>  If this helped, see if you can help me!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoWzTR25YqzRGEpJJpfnjzDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221144225AAUg8bH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|g3YhMKLTaa	u r a guy who likes to be open and honest with out hurting any1 feelings .. the msg i got is that u should cheak all ur e-mails, txt, calls and c if she had said anything .. that made her act like this she needs to get a grip and clean up her attitude u need to come clean to her and if she is still saying ur controlling her then.. i hate to say this but u got to leave her she doesnt appreciate u.. and no u r not doing anything wrong|`|1827f7d14d775c74c2bb434298a79b68aa	it seems like you have a controlling....eh  hem.. b*tch. your night would be ruined if you go with her, and if she STILL wants to go with another guy even tho ur her bf, thats pretty sh*tty.<br>  if you do not go with her, you might save yourself the worst night ever. so you can decide if you wanna go with your best girl friend or whoever, or just chill or something. its only a big deal if you make it one. and hey, loads of free parties. so hop it up.<br>  wish you luck with the girl, <br>  barbie|`|YB0piA3raa	its a pretty hard situation! i am a girl right so this is goin to be from a girls point of view but personally i think that she is being a bit over the top about the whole thing i would prefer to go the prom with my boyfriend as it is a special night and i would like to spend it with my boyfriend but i think that she is being very childish about the whole thing becauser if she likes you she has a funni way of showing it i know that if i was like tat to my boy friend that it would be over and also that if i told him i felt single that it was over so i think you need to talk about this a lot or else just tell her its over it will hurt at first but you deserve so much better than someone who treats you like that.!<br>  good luck :D|`|YTmp3ODCaa	Im sorry your having problems. im not exactly sure why she is acting like that, you should talk to her agian .

8be2d4f7c42b5bbba3ad417d761a32edaa	girl, you'll never know until you try. let me tell you something...i've had this exact same thing happen to me except it's vice versa - i'm asian (chinese) and my boyfriend right now is black. at first, when i was just starting to date black men, i wouldn't let my parents know. i was scared they wouldn't be able to deal with it or accept it. i even had a discussion with my dad about the possibility of me dating a black man and we ended up arguing because he couldn't understand why i would want to date a black man. and just like you, i knew i would end up marrying or seriously dating a black man. it wasn't a phase either. i just found myself attracted to real, intelligent, strong black men. and there's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  in the end, i introduced my black boyfriend to my parents right after we made it official. four year later, we're still together and my parents really like him. they came to realize that it's not about race, but about how he treats and respects you. and i would've never been where i'm at now if i was still worried about what they thought (and keep in mind, they're traditional chinese folk! eek!).<br>  <br>  by the way, my boyfriend's family was very accepting of me, so maybe your family will be accepting of your asian boyfriend. in my experience, black folks are so much more accepting and welcoming than many other people i've met. so it might just work in your favor. good luck, girl!|`|3ztjaDBaaa	By the time you are old enough to date in a serious manner you would be your own grown woman being able to financially support yourself and not have to worry about your mother kicking you out.<br>  <br>  So it's really not an issue.<br>  <br>  Not to mention any mother who does that is letting her prejudice get in the way of her parenting.
71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	Since I don't know the details of your situation its hard for me to say.<br>  <br>  You could start by apologizing to him for what ever it is you did to him. If your not sincere about it though don't bother. Once you have done that its really out of your hands. Its up to him if he wants to forgive you and then if he still wants you as a "Friend".<br>  <br>  You may just have to give it time, when someone you trust hurts you it takes a long time for that trust to be rebuilt. There is no quick fix.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Why did you hurt a good friend?|`|TtvCFolNaa	It depends on what you did...start talking to him more and show him that you really do care for him and make sure he knows that you do too...that happened to me a few times and that's what I did and my friends totally understood that I felt really bad for doing so...hope this helped alittle!|`|IfOTZhQyaa	What if he did it to you, would you trust him again?

What is he talking about when he talks about other girls and such and the part about not having time to talk to you during finals, you have to respect that. You can't make him study weeks before and not near the finals. He might forget the stuff so I think you are in the wrong about that. As long as he isn't cheating on you, I don't see a problem but if it bothers you so bad, then dump him.|`|ZwLpzNI6aa	He obviously doesn't know what he's got in you or he just is a player. I'd drop him because obviously the feelings you're having aren't being reciprocated. Sorry hun, but I'd go find someone who will treat you better and pay attention.<br>  <br>  Wish you luck!|`|mFVfH83Xaa	Long distance relationships are hard. Believe me I have been in one for the past year and a half. I love my boyfriend more than anything in the world. But then again he doesn't act like a man whore. SO my suggestion would be to just go over the pros and cons of your relationship with him. If the pros out weigh the cons then stick through it. It can get better. But if there are more cons than pros I would recommend getting out now before he leaves you heart broken.
dFHsAXDMaa	I will tell you as a mother and wife I have to agree pastor at a local church is free. I grew up catholic and come from a big Portuguese and italian family but when I was about 20 I decided I was tired of sitting with my hands folded in my lap hearing about the same things week after week and learning nothing. I decided to take my faith and belief in God on a "road trip" I went to church after church on sundays until I finally found one that had the same basic beliefs  the assemblies of God church in my area.  I am sure there is one in your area as well. The pastors at these churches preach about real live issues and how to handle them and relate to then through the bible.... They also offer many pre marriage classes and counseling and guess what it is free. does not get any cheaper than that right. <br>  <br>  Also they are real people, how have had real issues, gambling, pre martial sex, money issues, drug addiction fights with husbands and kids and do not think you are going to hell for it but that it is a learning to and if you believe Jesus died on the cross to give you eternal life you already believe what they believe. <br>  <br>  try it ! Good luck and  I know christians get a bad rap as bible thumpers etc  but not all churches are filled with radicals most are filled with reall people and you will be amazed at the amount of great friends and female support you can gain there I belong to womens group which is  basically an excuse to eat desserts and drink coffee and talk about real issues we face like kids, husbands, disagreeing on certain issues and how house should be managed etc.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Well, I suppose if you'd like to have a third party involved... why not bring in an educated, trusted mutual friend?

You could just sit down one night and work it out for yourselves.  Good luck : )|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Our priest offers counselling for free. Try a local church minister is that's not against your religion.|`|8RllMdADaa	Yeah usually churches will have premarital counseling, but make sure they have a background and training in counseling couples. Even if you don't belong to a church most pastors will work with you, and the principles Christian or otherwise are basically the same for a successful marriage. You could do a counseling search online to get in thouch with a therapist and sometimes they offer sliding scale fees if you do not have insurance. Most of it is establishing expectations of each other, and getting used to who does what and how. Good Luck.|`|zsn7lrThaa	Think about what your asking. What are you expectations of a counselor? Your going to sit there and bring these things up in front of him (your partner) and the non biased counselor. For what? Will the counselor then mirror your words back to him, like your in another room? Tell your partner what you want or move on, don't get married!! The relationship should be great going into the marriage, not rocky. The rate of divorce is huge.You know this already. Why be a statistic? If your partner doesn't mirror your value system and you his, then something is not going to change over night with counseling.  One thing would, you will have less money than when you started.|`|dIw7MqTdaa	If something needs to be 'affordable' in this case, chances are neither of you should be getting married.
01KVxwVOaa	well maybe you should back off a bit.. but every girl is flattered when a guy makes any kind of pass at her it's just the way were wired:)|`|pwiRMmicaa	damn sorry about that.<br>  you gave her a confidence boost and she feels good about herself when you told her. she explained it out to you so you wont get mad,keep talking to her homie!|`|CVvYhEfGaa	sweetheart no, its alright for you guys to be friends in the future, but maybe you should wait awhile before trying to be friends with her, if she is in love with someone else, she would only be keeping you around as her little pet, ive done it before without even realizing i was doing it, ive been threw this many many times and it only hurts you more in the end, your delaying the inevitable heartbreak if you keep trying to win her over.|`|gLfqJwgqaa	she was probably just flattered someone liked her.<br>  i hate to say it but if she is engaged just be friends.<br>  <br>  maybe if something happens with her and the other guy you can be there to pick up the slack
b9fae45b6e9e49f9e502d412e0c0ae32aa	like him! theres nothing wrong with that.
pVnUhYLQaa	To answer your last question, of course he wants to get laid. He's presenting his come ons as a joke to protect himself. That way he gets to say the things to you that he wants to say, but if he gets a negative reaction from you he can always say, "I'm just playing around". But he's definitely not just playing around, he wants you. <br>  <br>  As for your first question: does he ONLY want to get laid; that I don't know. He may want to take it further, he may just want to do you, but I get the impression that either way is cool with you (am I wrong?), so I say go for it. Maybe it can be something serious or maybe you get a good lay, either way, you win.|`|AA10928125	Dating a co-worker is the worst thing you can do...even if you don't have sex...sometimes he brags and says you do. He's just jerking your chain...you are headed for disaster...but if all you care about is having sex,then no problem. He's probably got a bet going how fast he can lay you...of course he's only interested in sex! hello??|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	You should report him for making sexual comments. Your "Crush" should stay out of the office, and don't think anyone can hear you, someone is going to get the wrong idea about the both of you and tell the boss. Be sure who you are dealing with before you invite him over.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	He may be interested in you but it sounds like he's just a flirt.  I don't think he wants to just jump in bed. (not without a few dates first).<br>  I'd ask him out for coffee first.  Be careful though, dating someone at work can cause some major problems.|`|AA12066269	Be careful, relationships with co workers can cause serious problems.  Such as sexual harassment.  Your employer may also have rules about dating coworkers.  Personally, I think his behavior is very unprofessional and reeks of harassment.|`|1M90Aoytaa	you could invite him round for coffee in the same joky mannor and see what happens? ie if he says about the bathroom you could say 'oh well youl just have to come over to my house later instead'<br>  thats IF you want to sleep with him - sounds like he wants sex rather than a relationship but he might just be joknig so test the water with half jokes|`|573ff68ce396f8af6bff7fb513e710d7aa	sounds like he just a flirt, maybe hes only joking , i have the same thing happening at ma work place but the diff btw me and u is tht i know its all a joke bcos we flirt alot and say all sorts bt things but thts  where it ends, the guy might not take it as far as u are taking it so dont worry if he is a serious one he would be making a move sooner or later. xxx|`|JMnu0rBiaa	Yeah, i mean, at first, everyone is connected by physical attraction.. Only later does the emotional stuff set in. But if you've worked with him for awhile and all he has to say is sleezy stuff, hes probably isn't going to be anything but a 3 minutes marathon.|`|SsfnitjXaa	First of all all 18 year old boys want to get laid.  Second of all you should not be sexual with your co-workers.  That is never a good idea.  Third of all your behavior is already sending the "wrong idea".  Good thing you are shy.<br>  <br>  What has this have to do with "Weddings".
AA11916218	Unfortunately you can't change your parents thoughts or what they say...ya it's annoying but you may want to let them know that your pretty much open with them about what goes on in your life but if they keep teasing you that may change and you really don't want to start hiding things because you like the fact that they trust you and that you can be open with them...let them know that when you say your only friends with someone that's what it means.|`|nALesYKvaa	ur parents have generally grown up in a society where that was the case. they find it better to presume he is your boyfriend, and treat him with the lack of security as one. therefore whoever it is, relatiponship-wise, they can have better trust thst their daughter will be safe.
bQR2Ld7Eaa	My Dear,<br>       He was letting you down easy. If he liked you, he would have given you his number. But being a guy, if he really liked you, he would have asked for your number. The old "phone was broke at a party," is just a line guys tell girls to let them down easy. MOVE ON, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU!|`|R6ljSjWwaa	Next time you see him, you could ask him what he is up to these days. Ask about his friends. Talk to him. Then invite him to some event you're going to (prepare that in advance lol). Give him your number so he can call you to tell you if he's gonna be at the event or not. If it's a cellphone, text him the day of the event, if he hasn't called you yet, to remind him. After that, I don't know. See what happens and come back here with the next question :-P<br>  <br>  Thanks for answering my question btw :-)|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	i dont think you should give up on this. you said you all were good friends. but you ended it for a reasone think about it|`|DESWKtdgaa	If he says no he says no, DONT be scared of getting rejected its pointless, life for livin'! Give it a go if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen and you can get on with looking for someone worthwhile! Put another way, you will be no worse off than before if he said no, but if he said yeah you'll be happy right? Thats a fair gamble to me, a chance of winning but no chance of loosing, GO FOR IT!|`|uBmomdQCaa	Sorry to break it to you, but :<br>  Seems like he doesnt want to talk to you<br>  He ended the convo, so maybe he was busy<br>  Next time you see him, just be like "whats up?"<br>  <br>  This doesnt seem to work, im sorry.|`|gUnZda0raa	if it was me i ask him out doesn't matter what happens so my answer to u is go for it ok. If he say no ask him again and again until he said yes
LKsl00CTaa	The first one, but with mystery added. Seriously, a girl that's not gonna' lead you on and who doesn't hide who she is but will let the guy find out a bit more each day.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|W6o3UQLkaa	1st one, then you can have good conversations and you know who she is that you like
eGpOIV12aa	in todays day and age everything evolves around computers and cellphones<br>  <br>  you could act like your messenger or facebook/myspace doesnt work and if the boy you are interested could do a favor and contact you.<br>  great conversation starter
KJxwNfsaaa	tell her straight up.<br>  if shes really your bestfriend that shouldnt be a problem.<br>  but dont blame it to much on her,<br>  cause we cant help who we fall for.<br>  and since you dated him and he was around you alot and shes your bestfriend, its very easy to fall for him<br>  but yes it is pretty much friendship rule to not date each others ex's but sometimes it gets hard cause you really like them in the end.<br>  So just tell her you dont like it and hopefully she will back off till your completly over him <br>  or just simply tell her to back off till your over him and find someone new|`|OCTvfDsxaa	It's going to be hard but you got to tell her. She is your friend and she deserves the truth. Tell her that you thought you would be ok with it but now your not so sure. Tell her it isn't her-it's you. Explain in detail how your still getting over him and the mistakes you made in the relationship. Tell her you love her as your friend no matter in her decision but you really need more time. You know your friend would be good to him but the pain of getting over him is really getting to you.|`|9ItnGZdJaa	it depends if you wanna be mean or nice, <br>  if you wanna be maen to her start talking to your ex agian make him like you more than he likes her,but im warning you that if you do that then everybody will start hating you.<br>  if you wanna be nice, let them like eachother,<br>  i mean yeah, one of my bestest closest friend went out with my ex that i broke up with like 4 months ago, but i still like him a little, but since I said its okay go ahead and go out with him, she was sooo happy, so just let them be.|`|Fulmgnmsaa	So do you still like him? Well that has happened to me and it was fine with me. It ended up my x went out with my friend to get closer to ME!!!!|`|Es6XJpcBaa	that is the biggest girl rule.. DONT go out with your best friends ex.<br>  <br>  <br>  you need to confrunt her she shouldnt have done that.. you may need to get a new best friend..|`|iTZDDBqoaa	If you are not over him why did u break up with him? Once you break up with him he is free so technicially they could go out.  If your friend is true though she would give to time.|`|5ZwXXEo3aa	LOL you type like your 12. obviously he shouldnt be THAT hard to get over.<br>  <br>  its her choice really, deal with it...
eGpOIV12aa	phone sex isnt the same as touching and feeling someone else's skin next to yours.<br>  <br>  you two need a refresher and spend time together before you two grow too far apart
TthDWtPTaa	sorry
TthDWtPTaa	why would she even care?
IgEYfBPJaa	Just ask him nicely about it, and say that you would quite like to meet them. There might be a reason (the age gap or something) why he doesn't want you to, only way to find out is to ask him :)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|VSXUa9lraa	I didn't have dinner with my boyfriend's parents until about a year passed. If he says he wants you to meet his parents but it never works out, it's something to do with his parents.|`|BGeULTx0aa	he should have introduced them to u already. THERE'S A REASON. he might be ashamed of u ? or something else, u should definitely talk to him about it.|`|AA10510158	I think it is passed the time for you to meet his parents.  How serious is your relationship?  If he was serious about the relationship and you as a girlfriend, he would be making the introductions.|`|RYtqFntJaa	you're 24, and he's 35? ouchers
b53k0EZkaa	never works...sorry|`|KFUsmwItaa	Lots of people will say it won't work. That's not true, it can be hard, and being away for long periods of time can make you drift apart and put strain on the relationship you can do anything you want to, if you really want this to work and willing to do anything you can.|`|rAtO08x5aa	thats the great thing about relationship, anyone of them can work! and thats why relationships are always make for interesting story. One thing is common in all "impossible" relationship is always the people who are involve. You started out with this guy like a month, that may not be enough time to know him good enough but love always does the impossible I'd say give it a try, be honest with your feelings, encourage him to be honest with his and give it all you've got, then in the end what ever comes out of it, Just know that you tried and that you learn. Good Luck<br>  <br>  J.R|`|3N5onOZraa	Depending on your age and everything, it varies.  If you're in high school i'd say stay in contact and date other guys who live here.  If not i'd say haul out there to Europe and be with him if you really want him.  Life is short, you'll make it work.|`|YGYMocGRaa	long term relationships dont work. the earlier you realize that the easier itll be|`|Y1npBMS0aa	swim across|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	lol gj|`|RUD2N3Sqaa	first of all how old are you , if ur under 18 it could get dificult, this relationship will all depend on how much you guys see each other in person and spend time together daily, and if he really wants to be with you he will wait for you, its all up to him because his the guy, since its only been a month and a half its hard to say, just relax and try to talk to him daily as much as u can n everything should be fine goodluck.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	Long distance relationships are hard. You need to realize that you can't really see what he's doing and see him. And cheating and stuff is something that you can't really control.<br>  <br>  If you like this guy, then maybe try to set up like a video cam for like every day or a couple times a week...or you could send postcards/ letters. Those are always fun to recieve. You can also send like care packages and such..<br>  <br>  I wish you luck!!|`|uvYYX1hsaa	Ok, so I live across the country from all of my friends and family. I was particularly close to a guy, but we didn't date. (He's like my brother so I wouldn't date him.) I don't get to see this guy very often, because whenever I'm back home, he goes to Mexico or Germany to see family.<br>  <br>  My point is that you CAN still keep in touch. We I.M. on a regular basis and text. If you can keep in touch like that and see each other when you can, you won't have to break up with him. <br>  <br>  Staying close when you are far away isn't hard as long as you are committed to him and to keeping in touch. And if he likes you as much as you seem to like him, he'll do his part in staying connected. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!
mtgu5jJdaa	Look man, you gotta love that grapefruit, I know theres no way I could live without it. I was in a similar situation during my past with my ex wife. She told me to get rid of that damn grapefruit or shed leave me and take my two kids Pebbles and Salami away.<br>  <br>  Well I chose the grapefruit. My wife left me and i fell to pieces, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't focus on my business and ended up bankrupt. Im now back on my feet but it was hard. But I tell what Bob, if I had to make that choice again, I wouldn't change a god damn thing, you know why... because I f**king love grapefruit|`|miV9g6ELaa	Maybe you should try to eat them when she isn't around, or eat them less noisily or less whatever annoys her. To be honest though, if your girlfriend isn't going to let you eat grapefruit at all, she's probably not worth it.|`|0OUrijq5aa	slap that hoe|`|7VBdPtIQaa	Keep eating them.

My daughter found hers when she was 30.|`|oYF3nIbsaa	13 mice?? YEEPERS!|`|eUf9e81eaa	Yes, many people like girls like you because you love pets.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Your personality is the key to someone truly liking for who you are.  You gotta laugh, like to have fun, be open to new ideas, try new things, do things that other people like too.  You sound like your a lovable girl for a guy, just be careful that you are still nice to the guy, but don't give him all the goodies.  Let him work for it.|`|FebNOmqDaa	I am not a boy but as long as you are true to yourself as well as honest, then why not. Remember the saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

The only thing that you have stated is that you are a girl, with black hair, and you have animals, and you don't want to be nice to get guys to like you? <br>  <br>  Why are you posting this question? There is more to a person besides what animals they keep. <br>  <br>  Do you like a girl like you? It seems you are trying to get validation yet have revealed nothing but that you are obviously insecure.|`|M89w2Jzzaa	Just the fact that the one of the first things you say is you have thirteen mice is kind of repellant. You're supposed to say the good things first and the interesting-maybe-scary tidbits later, once they're hooked.<br>  PS? You might wanna try to be nice.|`|dlrximyQaa	I'm more of a cat person than dogs but I love my puppy. Animals are awesome. I'd sooner crash my car than hit a possum. Mice rule. Goldfish die to easily but they are cool. If your not nice to me and yell at me then I'll yell back but I will enjoy it. Profanity is alright. But if you don't swear then that's ok.|`|3N5onOZraa	You sound fine.  Maybe be more confident in yourself and show confidence by not asking people if they would like you.  Think about it like this, for every girl, there's a guy out there that would totally chase after her.  It's not the same for guys, so you're lucky.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	i really dont know what to say about that!!! generally, physical look is the very first attraction but it doesnt mean that the person likes that person just because they look good.... its kinda got something more to do with how you treat them...... comfort level........ if youre uncool.... then its a  turn off...... so technically guys will like you based on how you handle yourself!!!!! goodluck!!!|`|BbaR8Hhqaa	im bi. and i wouldnt like you. eww, mice!?!? i hate animals. but idk bout guys, they might like that you like mice. who knows?|`|b53k0EZkaa	im a girl but still uh long hair....grosss get medium....be nice to boys wow.....and mice EWWW|`|3kOEtCauaa	yeah, freaky awesome.

iBtZUcHjaa	if you want to continue your relationship with this man, then yes say sorry. but also think about why you sent that text, what made you feel angry enough to even write that. Maybe then any problems can be identified and discussed with him :]|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	It depends on what he did, and how bad it was.<br>  <br>  If you sent the text for no reason, or feel guilty because it was harsh, i would say sorry.|`|3b352647c1451744c77be95b0723c695aa	Well, only you know if he deserved it or not. <br>  If he did something which hurt your feelings, or was in anyway disrespectful, then, chances are he deserved it. <br>  Maybe you can start by saying to him what your state of mind was when you wrote him the message and what motivated you to do it. <br>  Then say sorry because you still don't want to hurt him. <br>  <br>  But, there are times when you have to give a man you love a piece of your mind and let him come to you. <br>  <br>  Having said that, only you know if what he did was that bad.|`|aY6EjDwjaa	if you feel you were wrong yes.<br>  you might have hurt his feelings

WoRaXE73aa	Yes, I would say that he likes you and would like to be your boyfriend. So far there seems to have not been a chance for you two to go on a real date or talk about this. Write him a note or email, asking him on a real date and see what happens. My guess is he will jump at the chance.|`|f2fyXyulaa	good grief, if you like him go out with him! But be careful. If you cherish your friendship with him more than going out with him, tell him that and hopefully, he will understand. Good luck!!|`|upi3CwHzaa	that might kinda stink that everyone is going with you on your date which makes it more embarrising so tell him the truth an then tellyour family that you didn't like that an all!!
IL0LG5ahaa	If you don't love him, there no point in going out then, is there?<br>  Just nicely let him know he's not your type, and he's nice and everything, but it wouldn't work.<br>  If you did say yes, you'd have to dump him anyways. <br>  Its less complicated this way :)<br>  Good luck|`|fox5a3ePaa	Its best to be honest with him rather than lead him on.

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Don't take advice from anyone on here.  Anorexia is a very insidious disease.  If it were my daughter I would find the best anorexia expert--psychologist and/or psychiatrist, usually--within driving distance and go for a consultation to find out the proper approach.  Don't take your daughter, don't tell her, just go yourself.  Get your advice from someone with a successful track record of treating anorexic girls.  And find this person NOW, so you have the time you need.<br>  <br>  Meantime continue to supervise her vitamin taking; be compassionate but firm.  She doesn't hate you, she is ill.  For some reason she hates herself, and that is the problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck, my heart goes out to you.  Go find some expert(s) to work with and save your daughter's life.|`|AA10500537	take her to the er if you think shes dying . we dont let our children just die,<br>  its bad enough when they die from normal sickness.<br>  take her now|`|XoDUTquWaa	I really think she needs intervention asap. She can definately can and will die from this if it continues. Please get immediate help before her health is too far gone.|`|02714f74f20a85fd98454620daf8e793aa	BE STRICT, COUNSELING AND A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT IMMEDIATELY.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Your daughter has a very serious psychological issue.  Anorexia is a slow killer.  It's also linked to a host of physical and other psychiatric disorders that all require immediate treatment before permanent damage is done.<br>  <br>  At this point, if she will not consent to go to counseling, you should contact a treatment center and have her committed.  Maybe it seems like an extreme step for a kid who's doing well socially and academically, but anorexia is a cry for help.  Something is seriously wrong and she's begging you through this behavior to help her.|`|X9J0T7uKaa	Don't be strict, like the other person said...instead try to act as her friend..try to compliment her...make herself feel good about herself, maybe hide the scale for a while because she's prob weighing herself every morning...she prob thinks she's fat cuz when she goes out to buy clothes most of the clothes are like size 0 or 1..which won't fit any normal healthy human being..so when she compares herself to someone who might be a size 0 she thinks she's fat....boost her confidence, make healthy dishes and don't let her buy baby food.|`|xto2sWPBaa	Concerned Parent,<br>  <br>  Surely from what you have described to me that you don't know for fact that she truly is ill, and need to signed into a hospital for her own protection , you get her into therapy  and listen to your instincts and your heart as a mother.  She is not being rational, and sweetie its up to you to get her well, because there will come a day she will be sitting across the table from you a well adjusted adult thanking you for saving her life.<br>  <br>  You can live with that , but can you live with it if you ignore what she is doing to herself and let her die?  Don't think so.<br>  Get support groups for your family and get knowledgable on this disease and will all working together and prayer there is a wonderful future for all.<br>  Reach for it.<br>  <br>  Simplyshy
747ROylxaa	hear is all the ones i have on my computer.<br>  hope it helps:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "It's amazing how I feel when I'm around you, How my heart pounds when you come into a room. I look at you and think: My God! How lovely! And everything I am bursts into bloom. I feel as though you must, you must be mine, Not as a possession but a goal, Something almost unimaginable: The free devotion of another soul. As though I were about to enter heaven Or just within the hour condemned to die, My mind with one fierce thought keeps running over, With you, and only you, the reason why."<br>  <br>  I've waited all my life to find someone like you.<br>  My world is empty without you.<br>  I'm going to be there for you - always.<br>  I want to be with you forever.<br>  I enjoy every moment with you.<br>  I am so lonely without you!<br>  You're everthing I wanted, and more.<br>  I love your smile and the way you make me smile.<br>  I love your warmth when you hug me.<br>  I fall in love with you all over again, every time I meet you.<br>  I sometimes think of you when you're away and smile away to myself. People think I'm nuts.<br>  I cherish your love for me.<br>  I love you with my heart and soul.<br>  I can not wait to be with you.<br>  I trust you with all my heart.<br>  You make me feel at the top of the world!<br>  I can not get enough of you! You drive me crazy.<br>  You are the best, you are amazing!<br>  You just make me feel so good.<br>  I love the child in you.<br>  My heart longs for you when you're away.<br>  I Just Called to Say I Love You<br>  <br>  <br>  So it's not going to be easy. It's going to be really hard. And we're going to have to work at this every day. But I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, every day." <br>  <br>  "I dont know. I dont want it to be like this. I hate this. I hate the way you've made me feel and I'm sick of pretending that it doesn't hurt me because it does."<br>  <br>  like who I am when I'm with you, And I know you feel something too. Nobody else can make me even half the person I am when I'm with you.Because it's there between you and me, You can't deny that, please know that I am forever changed Because of who you are and what you've meant to me." <br>  <br>  "Love never fails; people fail love." <br>  <br>  "So you failed. You wanna be really great? Have the courage to fail big and stick around. Make them wonder why you're still smiling." <br>  <br>  "There is one moment in life when you are with someone and you feel like the world has stopped and your life seems so perfect. Make sure you never lose that person." <br>  <br>  "Is anybody satisfied with who they really are? You could be the moon and still be jealous of the stars. You gotta learn to swim if you can't walk upon the sea, so I'm learning to live with me." <br>  <br>  "I wake up thinking of you, and that weirds me out. I try not to call you, but I can't do without. Hearing your voice tell me, that I am on your mind, It wouldn't work to rush this, I'll come around in time." <br>  <br>  "It's not supposed to always make sense, because love isn't made to be predictable." <br>  <br>  "If you didn't have pain, you wouldn't know what good felt like." <br>  <br>  "Don't give up on love because there is always someone who loves you, even if it's not the person you were hoping for." <br>  <br>  "If they really like you they'll listen to what you have to say and not what they hear from others." <br>  <br>  "Everything we've gone through & everything we've accomplished can never be explained in words." <br>  <br>  "& I think that I'm impressed with your one night stands & your contagious kiss. I'm trying to get this right. Yeah. 'Cause I'm rediculous like that." <br>  <br>  "Let's just drink to get drunk, and tell each other everything. for a drunkin mind ; speaks a sober heart." <br>  <br>  neveroverlookwhatsrightinfrontofyourey... <br>  <br>  "After a while;; you'd think i'd eventually learn. but i dont. and never will." <br>  <br>  "True faith is to have confidence in who God is." <br>  <br>  "Isnt if funny how day-by-day nothing changes, but then when you look back, everything is different." <br>  <br>  "Yeah and I would recommend that you live with no regrets, and even if it seems like the world is crashing on you, you shouldn't let it hold you down." <br>  <br>  "If i kept you too close, it was becuase i wanted to keep you longer."<br>  <br>  <br>  Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when <br>  I really need it. <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes <br>    you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and <br>    it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You <br>    build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so <br>    that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from <br>    any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them <br>    a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, <br>    like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own <br>    anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and <br>    leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should <br>    be just friends' turns into a glass|`|kSFBMI6vaa	Idk but listen to the song Lucky by Jason Mraz and you might find something
duQ2cXKCaa	I know what you mean. Everyone feels kinda attracted to the "Bad boys!" Haha. But look girly, I'd stay away or just be friends with him. He's definately one of those guys who would go out with a girl, do something with her (catch my drift), and move on. He's just in it for one thing.|`|UgEo3BIhaa	im sorry it sounds he was just in it for action..i think you guy would be better off with being just friends and see what happends from there..and yes wait for him to contact you. if a guy wants to talk to you, he will.|`|QkIfyLdgaa	See its something about ******* that attract some girls all the time.

If you believe in evolution, I'm sure it is said that males are "programmed" to find this attractive just like they would breasts, although not on such a level. It is something to do with the way a woman's eyes brighten and how they show their neck and one or two other technicalities. They say it is why men are funnier than women, because they need to be to facilitate this behaviour and therefore perpetuate the courtship dance.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh yeah, and probably jsut cos she's cute and you like her.|`|gb3pcpMBaa	awwe thats cute, its because you like her alot :)<br>  i feel the same way about my guy he is so adorable when he smiles|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Awwwww thats so sweet.|`|FcqDWdF1aa	Congrats your in love.;)|`|KvpNij1raa	you are in love :)|`|zlQNr40Uaa	its called love hun ;]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  aww|`|tWvM6M0raa	it's cause your in love with her|`|YD4VLwOFaa	awww super sweet! you are in love! hold on tight and never let go! <3|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	It's because you look at her through LOOOVE eyes.

From the sound of it he's like many guys. But considering hes at a mature stage in his life, he has no time for games. What you need to do is make it clear to him what bothers you. Here's a big sign that he cares. You mentioned that he gets jealous when you  bring up other men. In all honesty if a guy doesn't care for you, you could be sitting there kissing someone else and it wouldn't bother us. The fact that he's jealous shows signs that he does care about you but from my view, it seems he doesn't like games but yeah, he does care for you.|`|m67kW8XVaa	First, tell him how you feel again, and how it hurts when he does that. <br>  Second: If he doesnt answer, or no reaction, then just dont send or ask. If he really loves you, then he'll try talking or begin sending.<br>  Good luck, it seems annoying :S|`|LM51jhEUaa	You shouldnt waste your time on him. if he cant do something like reply to a text he is never going to reply to you period.|`|7VQv3cgoaa	What's the odd situation you mentioned and the disrespect you mentioned? I don't hear where you're coming from. Surely it's not the none response to your text message. Text messaging is a horrible way of communicating with someone you love. Text messages get lost or accidentally deleted which leaves the other party like yourself angry, sad, and disappointed so stop sending your most intimate thoughts via text messages. Next time pick up the phone and call him or wait until you see him to express your feelings for him..<br>  <br>   Now to answer your question, I'm going to do so with a question. Why should he answer your text when you don't even believe him when he tells you that he loves you? You've got to find peace and love within yourself before you can receive it from anyone else. Think more positive, know your worth and it wouldn't hurt to have a little faith in your man.<br>  <br>  Btw, who ever said you were being abused is way off base.|`|8O0vy4Fkaa	dump him n come c me lol x<br>  STICK 2 ur guns n let him do chasing 4 a change, if he dont chase leave him n find sum1 else x it sounds like u need sum1 better anyway x x x
lWxUn0Xraa	1. you don't believe in love because you haven't seen it first hand. hopefully one day you will because it exists. without it, we wouldn't be human.<br>  2. it is NEVER ok to get inbetween a couple. i have the lowest amount of respect for cheaters. how would you feel if you were dating someone and he cheated on you? think about it. youd feel horrible. you have hormones? big deal, we all do. take a cold shower! stop being selfish and consider how this other girl would feel for a change. if you don't believe in love, you should at least believe in sisterhood... in women respecting one another because so many times men use that against us!
ATXdIbgpaa	just talk with him if he wants to be your b/f  or no if he doesn't want then forget him and find a other person.because my advice to you is, love somebody who lives you and if he doesn't love you ,why do you love him?|`|A5HLjtqRaa	maby you just need to get him alone and talk.<br>  im sure he feels the same way.<br>  do you love him?<br>  if you do then you need to reach out and dont hold back.<br>  let him know how you feel.<br>  if he loves you then hell do the same.

While I imagine you both want a certain amount of closure and certainty, it may not be forthcoming in the near future. Allow some time for him to process this on his own and with his friends and family. <br>  <br>  Go to the doctor. Have some tests. Start making some short-term goals/plans. Give yourself some certainty and something to work towards. Learn more about being pregnant, preparing for adoption, or having an abortion. Talk with your friends and family about your experiences-- hear what they have to share. <br>  <br>  After you have allowed him time to  process and after you have collected your information/started to set goals. Go to him again from a place of strength. Tell him what you are thinking about doing. At that point he might have ideas of his own. Regardless you will both be calmer and more informed.|`|jbV0rH5vaa	dont let the baby get in the way the baby comes frist it wasnt a mistake the thing is wonderful.:).dont let it ruin you and the baby if he cant accept the fact that.then he isnt worthy of being with you heres what i can say "if he cant be with you your best then he damn well cant have you at your best" best of luck friend:) xoxox.just remember the baby is living breathing inside of you..it doesnt stand a chance alone./:.|`|WuW5eSZpaa	what the hell you mean what does he want you to do, no its about what you want to do, you both made the decission to have unprotected sex and now you have a responsibility, a child is a blessing so if you want to keep it great and if you dont want to thats your choice but think long and hard and make sure you can deal with the choice either way you go.|`|TDO6EQsgaa	tell him to grow a pair, and then make him realize that when you have sex you take a risk of getting pregnant  with or without protection. if hes a good guy their is only one thing he will do.

Everyone doesn't sit around waiting for the phone to ring.|`|xZI6noJiaa	He's not interested. And getting his number from a friend of his will seem very stalkerish. He won't call back, and won't ask you to call back, so it's just best to move on.|`|EQVFlUbEaa	It's probably likely that he was simply shocked about the 'date' thing, or was nervous about you asking/the conversation heading that way so fast.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	You imposed on his privacy.

He was only saying you'd have to talk another time, because he doesn't have the brass to just come out and say that.<br>  <br>  I would recommend writing him off.  Even if he calls you or runs into you somewhere, you should be concerned about what his real motives are, because it's apparent that he didn't want to spend any time on you here.<br>  <br>  I do wonder, though, what's up with these people, who immediately jump to "how'd you get my number?"  I get calls from people, who didn't ask me for my number and I either talk to them or I don't, but I don't immediately freak out about it.  You have to wonder just how important these people think they are in the world.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	Dear Serenity,<br>  <br>  Jacob is just not into you. Have you ever heard of the book called, "He's just not that into you." by Greg Behrendt. This may be good reading for you. I mean that in the kindest way possible. I'm not being sarcastic.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would find somebody else that you're interested in that would return your affection.<br>  <br>  Indeed, it took courage to call him since he didn't give you his number. I think he was in shock that you had the audacity to call him without him giving out his number. If I were him I would feel the same way.<br>  <br>  Think about if a guy called you that you hadn't given your number. Wouldn't you feel a little uncomfortable? Especially if you didn't like him.<br>  <br>  I would not take that conversation personally. As I said you will get much better results if the guy asks for your number. That's the way things are traditionally supposed to work. Sometimes I will give the girl my number but it doesn't always work that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope you don't take this too hard because in the scheme of things it's not a big deal at all. Think about it as 1 more no you don't have to hear again before an inevitable yes.|`|7ach0Dz5aa	I'd say he doesnt want you to call him back. He sounds like an asshole anyway, shoulda told u he didnt want to hang out with u instead of hanging up on you.

He was very rude.  Just chalk it up to experience and put your energies elsewhere.  BTW, if he did not give you his phone number, you just sort of "got it", that was risky to call in the first place.  If you see him, hold your head up high and just be casual.|`|3b64d55f38714d4b534a070ab26f5d48aa	So you freaked him out.<br>  <br>  Be interested in guys that are interested in you.

You do not under any circumstances call someone who hasn't given them their number personally to you. Whether or not they like you. It comes across like you are a stalker (not trying to sound flip). In a way you set your self up for this to happen. I can understand why he did that, it was a surprise and unexpected. I know it probably did take a lot of courage and balls to do what you did. Hopefully you will take this unfortunate lesson, learn from it and don't repeat the same thing.|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	Its okay jus move on but he prolly didnt want you to have his number n then the fact u went and got it from someone else might make him mad but forget him.

AA11461524	no to both. you cant love someone just by seeing them. that only means you love the way they look. you dont kno anything about them except that.|`|AA11447210	That's 2 totally different questions. Soul mates are rarely romantic partners, and yes you might have a feeling of deep connection to someone the first time you speak to them (as if you've known them a long time).<br>  <br>  Love at first sight? No. That's lust. Love takes really getting to know someone inside and out, and acccepting them (warts and all). That can't occur when all you know is what they look like. It can take months or more for love to even begin to develop...|`|Zk7uWuoVaa	how old are you???|`|ACNECiZAaa	To your first question I say yes. I think you can know someone is your soulmate the first time you "really" talk to them. I don't mean little chit chat, but that crazy we talked for 7 hours straight talking. I mean I fell in love with my boyfriend after knowing him for 3 days, we also talked for 90% of those 3 days either on the phone, through text messages, or however way we could communicate. And I instantly fell in love with him.<br>  <br>  Now I don't believe in love at first sight, but lust at first sight does certainly exist. It's the cause of the tragic one night stand.|`|A9JV4uAxaa	I believe in it personally...i saw this girl once, and i just got a stomach ache.

kUE3Ddktaa	There's a difference between "must" and "nice to do," and some bridezillas and wedding websites get that confused.<br>  <br>  MUST:<br>  - purchase your attire for the ceremony, including any accessories/shoes<br>  - attend the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner<br>  - be on time to all wedding-day activities - hair appointments, photos, ceremony, and reception<br>  - during the ceremony, you may be asked to hold the bride's bouquet, hold on to the groom's ring, or adjust the bride's train<br>  - have a good attitude and be a good friend to the bride.<br>  <br>  Easy, right? Those are the must-dos.<br>  <br>  NICE TO DO:<br>  - organize (with the other bridesmaids or family members) a shower and bachelorette party for the bride, if she wants either of those<br>  - assist the bride with wedding-related tasks that you are able to take on (helping her select bridesmaid dresses, going dress shopping with her, addressing invitations, etc)<br>  - make a toast to the couple during the reception<br>  <br>  Some brides go crazy and think their MOH is on earth to help plan and organize the entire wedding - not cool. Asking someone to be an MOH is an honor, not indentured servitude. The MOH's life doesn't stop just for the bride's wedding, and nice bride understands that.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	She must hire the exotic dancers.|`|ry0ZQvRUaa	OMG lots lol this site was VERY helpful to me<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bridesmaid101.com/maid_of_honor_duties.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridesmaid101.com/maid_of_hon...</a>

It sounds to me like he's doing exactly what my older brother by 4 yrs is doing. When we were growing up we were close like you and him and he went away to college, he found a wife and even though he did live with us it's like he was a totally different person. This is normal. You are you and he is he, if that makes any since. You do need to let him know in your own way though that you are family and even though you are 2 totally different people you do need to have some kind of communication, don't let him close himself off from his family. Let him "find himself" and you "find yourself" but yet don't loose the fact that you are still family.|`|l0xnIquFaa	i get what you mean!! my brothers and me used to b super close (im 14 they are 20 and 22) my brother who is 22 is totally like yours.<br>  try talking to him, and ask him to go somewhere with you (like a movie, or shopping or somthing fun) and just have a good day with him.<br>  try writing him a letter or somthing.  <br>  <br>  my brothers are closer to friends then family now. thats just how they are, if i get upset at them about them ignoring me i just tell them and they usually understand. if they laugh at me then i just ignore them for a while, and sooner or later they notice.<br>  <br>  i suggest try talking to him, writing him a note is easier it may sounds dumb but at leaste he will get it and hear what you are trying to say.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped a little bit
AA10529674	If he really loved you, he wouldn't be cheating. You deserve better than that.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Uhmm you definitely have the right to confront him about that, and if he thinks you're paranoid...Too bad - you OBVIOUSLY have the right to be paranoid too! Haa. But I'm so sorry, I couldn't imagine the feelings surging through your body right now. I HATE it when my boyfriend texts all kinds of different girls and I don't know what they're talking about :/|`|lq2Ewg5Zaa	listen he dont care about you,not at all, the reason why? he is a cheater and a bad one (cant even delete the texts)<br>  dump him or wait for him to dump you which will soon happen|`|pTCWTxlIaa	o wow dump his *** right away. are you even serisouly considering still staying together? lying about v-day is a biggggg deal and he is talking about taking another girl out?!??!?! honey that's all grounds for leaving him right away preserve what's left of your dignity!|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	he will be true to you ..or he won't.....Checking his messages will not make him care for you more ..or care for you less...That comes from inside him, doesn't it ?|`|FiCl71flaa	Your actions are the mark of an insecure, jealous,paranoid, and suspicious girlfriend. Have you stopped to think that it is precisely this type of behavior on your part that is making him "shady" about his phone and not being open with you. You indicated that he is not the cheating type since his ex cheated on him multiple times so why do you do it. Do you realize that what you are doing is invading his privacy and how would you feel if he went through your private stuff like your text messages or diary. Or do you believe that exes can no longer talk to each other or remain friends just because they are no longer a couple.  If you truly like this guy and do not want to lose him , you have to respect his privacy, trust him unless he gives you reason not to , and stop the third degree.Remember that he can do the same thing to you as you are now doing and I guarantee that you won't like it one bit. If you have any issues , or concerns , or problems, then sit down and talk to him and the both of you may come up with the answers.Kissing  an ex(especially when you are broken up is not an issue to violate one,s privacy or confront them as if they have done something major. Think long and hard about your actions before they hurt you.|`|kDyj5d7laa	Okay well one thing i have learn, you shouldnt be going throught your boyfriends text messages. that just leads to trouble bc no matter what you are probably going to find something in there you dont like. And guys hate it when you are noisy! I would confront him this time since you already went through the mesages cause you wont stop thinking about it until you do. But please take my advice, unless you are a parinoid gf, dont go through your boyfriends text messages!!! Good Luck :)|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	well that girl that he is texting, he didnt use to like her, he still does. dont be so dumb. he left you high and dry v-day so that he can go with someone else. and its not only v-day that he does that. dont even tell him anything about the cell phone, bc then hes going to turn it around on you and the whole lying topic will shift your way. just dump him|`|hH76CdQ1aa	Dump him NOW!!!!!!

Your anger is valid and you should definitely confront him about those texts. He is supposed to be with you not texting other women and calling them babe and whatnot. Plus, he told you he was working on valentine's day but it turns out he wasn't! I'm sorry but that's unacceptable! What was so important that he had to lie to you to evade you on the second most important day in the lives of couples?! I would watch out, no need for you to get hurt over some dumbass.
AA10450505	Your atty should have advised you - CALL the police, each and every time that he "shows up" intoxicated!!!  (drunk and disorderly charges = more ammunition, in court). Phone your local DCF (department of Children & Families or simply dial 211, from anywhere in the contiguous United States) and tell a representative everything you've typed, here. Is he the biological father? Is there, presently, an APPROPRIATE 'father-figure' in the picture?? Take care of your precious daughter and yourself, as well.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	If your lawyer has all the evidence about your ex boyfriends past then you should win hands down.

Bt1D1wWuaa	To HH - Although your suggestion sounds like it might be a good idea, I don't believe that would even be an option.  I realize every state has different laws, but in Illinois, you can NOT file in another state even if you have moved, in fact, the filing process not only has to be initiated in Illinois but it has to be done in the same county as to where the actual marriage took place.<br>  You can try what others have suggested by looking into what they call "Legal Aid" for help in filing for a divorce but that is all based on your income and assets.  Depending on whether or not you work and your spouses income, it may be possible for you to get an attorney and have your spouse be liable for those charges.<br>  Or, as others suggested, you can go to the courthouse and file on your own (it's called pro se) meaning you will represent yourself.  You may be able to start off that way and then once you get before a judge, he/she can advise you what to do next. Because I don't know your entire situation or what your financial situation is (jointly or solo) the judge will have all the information you submitted and recommend what is best for you.  <br>  Also, please know that he can refuse to sign whatever he wants until he is blue in the face but he absolutely can NOT prevent you from getting a divorce.  He can refuse all he wants but I do know that once divorce proceeding have begun, you WILL be able to follow through with or without his consent.  However, it may be time consuming and overall could get dragged out for some time  (possibly years) but ultimately his consent or lack thereof it means nothing!  So, please start  making those phone calls and get the ball rolling.  Good Luck to you!|`|EdDLydH7aa	I had to go to court and file my own papers b/c i knew i couldn't afford a lawyer, they have a way for you to file and write a letter to the judge explaining that you can't afford to pay for the divorce and the judge decides if you qualify, just go to the courthouse in your town and go to the family court, all courthouses have them and ask them if they have a law library and start there, it hurts but i understand when you say you want to get on with your life. Don't give up, just go and ask for help. I hope this helps, good luck to you|`|zsn7lrThaa	Move to a state that there is no separation laws. File for divorce and move on. Ask you attorney what to do?

kUE3Ddktaa	Getting a civil officiant is honestly one of the easiest parts of a wedding.

We got a small cake from a nicer grocery store bakery. My flowers were a ready ready made arrangement from a florist. I pulled them out of the vase and used zip ties to hold the stems together.

eD9MdcPUaa	High school is probably the best time to start dating. Jr. High/Middle School dating is such a joke I think. However, you will be the one that knows when you are ready to start dating because you will eventually begin to crush on boys (or girls if you are begininng to have sexual feelings toward the same sex), and then those feelings will start to get stronger as you get older...which will then make you want to date them. =)
lhl1820iaa	Hello :) Not that i can do much help but i feel exactly like you do. I'm a girl of 17 and okay i have had 1 boyfriend but it was ages ago and it didn't go all that well. It doesn't help no matter how many people say "oh it'll happen soon don't worry" because it makes you feel inadequate, and so many of my friends have a guy. It makes you feel lonely. <br>  <br>  But i just thought i'd say nowadays some teens don't really understand the principle of a relationship and act to use people. It's rare to find someone of our kind of age who genuinely just wants a true relationship so it's nice to find someone out there who's different.  Although you feel like this now (just as i do) there must be someone somewhere right? Are you going to uni or anything anytime soon? Because you'd probably meet loads of new people there? Sorry couldn't be of much help. Hope you find someone soon :)|`|Sr7trek3aa	Yes you are normal.<br>  There are loads of other people in the same situation, honest, i would know.<br>  There seems to be this immense social pressure to have a girlfriend when your young and it sucks. <br>  A girl will literally come along when you least expect it, it may seem hard to believe, but it'll happen.<br>  Just start working on increasing your confidence.|`|UY9KZhgpaa	dont give up hope you will find her just belive TIP:change your style|`|JveSbhSuaa	I'm 17 and never had a boyfriend, but I suppose it will happen some day :S<br>  To answer your question, you are normal there's nothing wrong with you.|`|53sVKcOeaa	Aww well don't look for a girlfriend and you'll find one thats what happened to me lol, if you meet someone now there more likely to be the one.

ss5vAWKSaa	I think you kind of like being submissive to her when you say "you can live with that."

That way you can have the best of both worlds.|`|DA4u3R9Eaa	Never make a commitment to misery! You're not married to this girl, so walking away should be less of a  problem for you than you think it will. Never date a person who bosses you around! And her bad conscious is her problem, not yours! She obviously does not value you as a person or have your best interest at heart! And it will only get worse if you stick around her any longer! Cut her off at the pass! Tell her it's not working for you. You don't owe her any explanations so just walk away. She's not God and she's not the cops. You don't have to answer to her for anything! Put your happiness above her foolishness and selfishness! You deserve to be happy! And you deserve to be with a better woman(or girl if that's the case) than her, who makes you happy! :)|`|XKn14Qpjaa	im a woman and THE MANLY thing to do is to make your boundary plain.

FmhUZLgoaa	I wouldn't do it when she is with her friends that just kinda puts you in the spotlight. When you see that she is not busy ask her if you can talk to her then simply say "Hey I was wondering if you would like to go to the Movies or dinner?" Something along that line. She will either respond with a yes or she will tell you shes not interested in you that way. Good Luck|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Approach her when she's with her friends, strike up a convo and then get her alone like ask her friends "Do you mind if I borrow your friend for a bit? I promise to bring her back in one piece" screw they're answer and just take her if she wants. Then continue your convo with her elsewhere and ask her out and then LEAVE when she says yes.<br>  <br>  Leave on the note of asking her out, this is important.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't, then you did what sooo many men are afraid to do.|`|buYatgxuaa	Ask her best friend "does _____ like me" if u want 2 ask her out do not do it in front of all of her friends you can do it in front of a couple though.

Next, just say, "Do you want to go out?" <br>  It's really that simple. As for 'pointless relationships,' no relationships are ever really pointless. You learn from each one.

Just do it yea its cliche, but t works. Two time of day doesn't matter whats so ever I'va had success from six in the morning to twelve at night so just pick. And finally NEVER I repeat NEVER ask her in front of her friends she may feel obligated to say yes and then youaren't in a relationship you're in a lie so ask her when it is you and her only no one else. Here's some advice think of something cheesy yea its retarded but they love that shite. For example if she likes soccer buy a cheap soccer ball and write all over it and give it to her worked for me so Merry freaking Christmas.|`|s7wIkFZWaa	Okay, well just stop and think about this.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of failure. If you're afraid of being rejected... you'll never do it, hence not going out with the girl.<br>  <br>  You have to face your fears and just ASK her.<br>  <br>  Just be casual about it. Just say, "Hey, so I was wondering, do you wanna go out sometime?"<br>  <br>  Being casual and not like...all formal will ease your tension and she won't feel all nervous about an answer.<br>  <br>  And ask her any time of day. Maybe when you feel most confident or when you are in a good mood. When she's with her friends and you don't know how to get her alone, just wait until she's alone in the hall or something, or at her locker alone. Or just when she is alone.<br>  <br>  Don't be nervous or afraid. If you are afraid of rejection, then you will never ask her, because you're too afraid of rejection so you don't even bother coming close to your fear.<br>  <br>  And making a relationship last comes AFTER asking that person out. So just focus on asking her out. If she says yes, start building a relationship with her THERE. <br>  <br>  And the only way to face your fears... is to DO them.<br>  <br>  You have to face rejection if she says no. Life WILL go on. I promise you. Though it burns to get denied, you will get over it.<br>  <br>  Just do it. Like nike do it! Haha<br>  <br>  Good luck, dude.|`|gHmgBfwxaa	ask her when she is alone. its alot easier. you need to do it if you really want to. better to try now then wish you had later in life.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222174136AAf7Wzg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ifTMSSjdaa	go for it. i know rejection sucks trust me but if you think that she likes you then why not?

Don't fight over a guy because you will lose a friendship over someone you both will forget about and lose something like a friendship that can last forever. Think about this would you want to lose someone that can be there for you, have in your furture wedding as a bridesmaid, go to college with, or to have when you need a shoulder to cry on? This guy wants sex and he is not worth it. Think of this... Is he going to to the one the only one you want to be with. Trust me you have so many years to go out and party and meet.

You and the other girls, you wanna know why? because she will be so heart broken if you go ahead and take the guy you love but she likes. But If you don't go for it, you could be risking dating the guy that was made for you. So both are a 50% chance of working, and making you happy. I suggest you talk to the friend, explain to her, how much you like him and if she is an understanding person sure she will be hurt but she WILL get over it beacuse theirs more guys in this world.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	idk, she could get mad at you if you two started dating, and let me tell you it's the worst when your friend goes out with a guy that you really like.

Have you told them everything you told us here?  I would be VERY surprised if they thought this was a good idea, and frankly, if they did, I would doubt their intelligence. <br>  <br>  Guys at 16 are NOT capable of having a decent respectful relationship - they are at least 5 years ahead of you in physical maturity than you are, but 10 years behind you mentally - ALL they really think about is sex.  I am not putting them down by saying this, it is just a FACT - and has been that way forever.  <br>  <br>  Get your PARENTS opinion on doing this before you do anything.

It's kinda an unspoken rule anyway that friends don't go out with other friend's exes.|`|0NcnWHz1aa	be a good friend but just sit down and talk to your mate and maybe the girl and explain why u cant go out with her hope i helped x<br>  <br>  <br>  PS PLEASE ANSWER MINE <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai8NQuW6tstgL4rqxBUwrwYgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222140934AADrb1Q">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|TEaHSHAQaa	do what you think you should do. which one do you like more? your best friend or some girl? either that or you can talk to your best friend. say that you want to date her and if he says no, ask him why not. ask if he still likes her. if he does, figure out which person gets the girl but that might start a big fight. if i were you guys, i would, both of you, look around for different girls. if she comes up to one of you, who can help it? and say you would never hate your best friend. and then you guys can set up a time, for example, you and your best friend can go to a movie every tuesday. <br>  HOPE THIS HELPED!|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	Just tell him that girls come and go but true friends last forever. If he's a true friend he'll just keep his mouth shut. My husband was friends with my ex and they still remain friends and I agreed to not speak anything bad about my ex. So I am proof that friends can still be bff's and have dated the same girl.|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	hit and run but dont fall for her.|`|MHMndoCcaa	OOOHHH>>>> <br>  yEAH, NEVER DATE YUR BEST FRIENDS EX,<br>  PUT YURSELF IN HIS SHOES....WAT IF IT WAS UR EX ?<br>  THINK ABOUT THINGS ...TALK TO THEM|`|s7us9819aa	Any girl is not worth sacrificing your friendship over.  I personally always have thought that it is a big "no no" to date someone that you know your bestfriend had a relationship with. He probably still has feelings for her and you don't want to make things awkward. <br>  <br>  Besides if you date her, and things don't work out you risk losing her and your bestfriend. <br>  <br>  Is it really worth it?...you must decide for yourself.. but remember bros before well you kno|`|zb70sXfPaa	its ur choice tell him he cant boss u around cuz it will get ugly just like my friend is mean to me and i take her crap wen i shouldnt and i really want to stand up for my self but im a pussy          sooo i think u should go for her if u really do like her but just try and be a good friend!|`|LKsl00CTaa	Well although your friend wouldn't like it, you should at least give it a try. Just take him aside first and confess that you really like her. After that, say he can't really stop you going out, then ask her.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Just tell him you don't want to stop hanging out with her and you shouldn't have to.

He should try to accept your decisions whether he likes it or not because his reasoning in this situation is rather weird to me. It doesn't seem like you're the type to hate someone just because a girl convinced you to. Give it a chance.|`|IikTFnCxaa	Well, to put it honestly, look somewhere else for a potential girlfriend.  If she and your friend didn't work out, what will happen if you two don't work out?  You will have lost a friend and have an ex-girlfriend who likes to talk about your business.  So take a long look at this and see it from your friends point of view...Would you like one of your friends dating your ex?  It will just lead to drama...Anyway, that is one of the rules of dating...Never date a friend's ex, especially if he doesn't like it..|`|ggbfZeBcaa	Just insure him that you can never hate him.  If you guys like each other than there should be nothing in the way.  And tell her you don't like it when she talks bad about him, and that your still gonna hang out, and hopefully you can all come to an agreement.|`|W0bHreiqaa	talk to your friend and the girl about it and figure out what to do.<br>  <br>  please answer mine <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As29v7xpKqveDQ1jor2Edujty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222102434AAfAZHx&show=7#profile-info-W0bHreiqaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2DD410m9aa	if you really lyk this girl then go for it and jus explain 2 your m8 that no girl can turn you against im cuz your both mates -=D|`|pT7mHBEVaa	i think you should get with the girl but make sure it is ok with your friend 1st =) n if he dusnt like the sound of that then meet up with here and tell your friend your poley :)|`|h9OgghFlaa	is not right for you to go out wit your best friend girl. not even when they are not together again.

It was wet and slobbery, and it makes me cringe just thinking about it, lol.  <br>  <br>  I didn't kiss a guy after that until I was 15, lol.  That would be the time I had my first real kiss, it was in an empty elevator and it was really nice.  I guess I was ready for it by then and I guess what feelings you have for the person also matters.  If you really like the person you'll want to kiss them and you'll know it.  Sometimes people ask, how do I know if I like/love this person, how will I know if I'm ready to kiss or do anything with them...the answer is...you will just know.  No confusion or anything.  Trust me.  When you're ready to have your first kiss you will know.  Age doesn't matter, everyone develops differently.

9eFFSMoraa	I wouldn't rush to it!! My best friend (a girl) got dumped by her boyfriend like this, She really really loved him, but he taught she cheated on him. Of course it wasn't true! it turns out that one of her friends was jealous on them because the loved each other so much, so he convinced the guy that she cheated on him. Instead of talking to the girl, the guy rushed to dump her. They both suffered a lot.<br>  <br>  If you really love her, don't think you'll escape.|`|YcQImRAraa	stop talking to her completely. trust me. hurts her the worst and you the lease. usually your own instinctsif you think someone is cheating are RIGHT.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Just tell her that you know she cheated.

Congrats on your relationship!<br>  <br>  PS I kno another poster told you to talk to him about it, I'd suggest doing that but not TOO much b/c it could put a strain on your relationship.  I'd also suggest speaking with your girlfriends about it (ones that you trust) so he doesn't get overwhelmed.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	If you speak that into existence then that will be reality. Just because girls do or will hit on him doesn't mean that he is liable to break up the relationship. One thing that is obvious is you might want to work on your self esteem (not trying to sound ugly, just being honest). One thing a guy will see eventually is a lack of confidence.|`|YcQImRAraa	ahh that's a big problem with dating attractive guys. my last boyfriend of two years was HOT as HELL.... girls talked to him non stop when we first started dating.. trying to get him to cheat and whatnot. after about six months all the girls stopped talking to him though b/c they realized that we were a serious couple. it will get better for you:) don't resort to dating ugly guys like most girls do.|`|lHIMSICbaa	Act confident and sexy around him but at the same time be sweet and caring so he knows that you care about him.

If  he did not want you or consider you pretty enough for him he would not have started to date you or be your man. While other girls might very well hit on him, the decision about whom to be with is his to make and not theirs.As you indicated , your issue is one of self esteem, self worth, and pride in your self. Plus you seem to believe that the sole basis of a relationship is physical looks. Although how one looks may play a role in a relationship, it is not the only factor or the most important. There is not much any body can do short of urging you to trust and believe in your boyfriend and his judgment in choosing you as his partner. Relationships can end for any number of reasons including other people coming into the romance and creating problems;but do not start to bury your own before it dies.Just continue to enjoy what you have and do not worry or concern yourself with issues you can not control.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Each of us is perfect for out imperfections.

PnE35NZlaa	Dont do it.It sounds like your wife is only agreeing because she fears that you will leave her if she doesnt.Dont turn outside of your marriage to fix a problem thats inside your marriage.<br>  You shouldnt have to be without sex and your wife should want to work on the problem and not just say "oh whatever" or be complacent/ok in that situation so assuming that she wants to work on it definatly dont get a mistress as you could turn something that was fixable in your marriage into something thats unfixable so then not only will you have lack of sexual intimacy you will then also maybe have jealousy,insecurity,yelling etc which will all affect your childrens emotional state.<br>  Counselling is overrated and many times produces no results/lasting results.Instead maybe like someone suggested your wife get her hormone levels checked as this could be the cause of why she has no desire.<br>  Hellerwork is something that might help because it works at releasing bodily and from the psych if theres an emotional/trauma cause why your wife doesnt like sex:eg if she was taught that sex was dirty or bad when she was younger or if she was sexually abused or if she was told women shouldnt enjoy sex or anything else like that.<br>  Acupuncture/tradtional chinese medicine is also very good at increasing desire  if theres a hormonal/bodily cause which makes your wife not desire sex and can actually also be good at the emotional aspect of things as in T.C.M everything is interconnected.<br>  Maybe you could also do some exercise together-like play tennis or something.it might make her feel more attractive and have some effect on the blood supply and hormones<br>  <br>  <br>  Here some links<br>  <a href="http://www.hellerwork.com.au/treatments.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellerwork.com.au/treatments....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.brisbanelivewellclinic.com.au/libido-crushers.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.brisbanelivewellclinic.com.au...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lilyliu.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lilyliu.com.au/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/therapist/22138" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/th...</a><br>  <br>  Take care Mary|`|d36da7bbff05d23acceb010110cea63eaa	I don't believe you should have to live the rest of your life without sex. But don't kid yourself that adding the ex to the mix will make life better. It will definitely complicate everything. And even if the ex says now that she's happy to be your friend-with-benefits, eventually she'll get tired of spending her Christmases and holidays alone. If your marriage is perfect outside of the terribly important sexual resistance, then it's only a portion of a marriage. Why don't you and your wife give sexual therapy a try. Maybe her going to a councilor didn't succeed because you're an important part of the equation. Sex therapy may reveal the base problem for your wife, or teach you how to get her icy engine fired up. Surely it's worth a try before you put your wife, marriage and your own self-respect at risk. <br>  The fact that you're asking a bunch of strangers what to do means that you're uneasy in your own mind about it. Best of luck with this difficult decision.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	The worrying part is that she has agreed reluctantly. Don't you see what this will do? She is only agreeing to it because she loves you and doesn't want to lose you, and if you take advantage of that, then things will definitely go sour. This has got nothing to do with being Aussie either, im Australian too, but it wins you no sympathy. You know who your wife is, and you say she has always been this way. Do the both of you a favour and work out what it is you want in life, either you want to be in a relationship with her or you don't. Why bother holding on to a relationship if you are going elsewhere to fulfill your needs.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	Your wife may be aggreing because she wants you to be happy but will one day likely regret it and grow resentful and angry. She needs to see a doctor and have her hormone levels checked. Something is likely medically wrong with her and getting to the bottom of it should be the number one priority here, not the need for you to 'get off'. Do some research, get her healthy and stay faithful. Nothing good will come of this arrangement she's agreed to and the fall out is going to be big and ugly.
naequcqlaa	I have honestly found that when a person constantly puts the blame on you, or their spouse, they in fact are talking about themselves instead!  Believe it or not, this is so true in too many cases. They get you to the point where you're second guessing yourself, exactly as you're doing.  In all actuality, the things he accuses you of, are actually the way he feels about himself.  Think about it. Does HE actually fit in this picture frame?  Is he the one who is doing what he accuses you of doing or not doing?  NO, you are NOT doing anything wrong, it's him!  Actually too, can you see just how he's the one who is controlling you?  When HE'S finished talking to you, HE hangs up.  He is doing all the controlling!  Now he's actually making you doubt yourself.  STOP letting him control you, control your tho'ts, control your mind into having YOU think it's all you, not him.  YOU take control! You at least CAN take control of your own mind regardless of what he says.  YOU can tell yourself, NO, it's not me, it's him who is doing what he accuses you of doing or not doing.  IF there was something wrong w/you, you wouldn't have the capability of working & taking care of your kids like you are.  YOU are doing a FINE JOB, HE"S the one who is LACKING & he's trying to control your very tho'ts making you second guess yourself.  DO NOT allow him to do this to you.  You pretty much have to "listen" to what he says, BUT you DO NOT have to ACCEPT the things he says.  You don't even have to fight about it, just KNOW in your heart, in your mind that it is NOT in fact you.  Look where he is at this time!  He's in jail!  Is that where people go who have control over their lives?  NO, it sure isn't.  You're NOT the one in jail, you're doing fine, you're free because you are the ONE who's doing things rite.  Think about it & just this one simple fact proves to you just who is the one who has it together, the one who IS doing things rite.  Of course he's going to put you down.  He's trying to pull you DOWN to his level.  Do NOT allow him to do this to you.  How can you in all honesty respect someone of his calibar, someone who had to be put in jail, that's someone to "respect"?  NO!  You have your reasons for staying w/this person.  Personally, I can see NO reason for even wanting to stay, to be w/a person like he is.  I trust just some of what I'm saying to you w/actually sink in & make some sense to you.  What I'm telling you IS the truth, I learned it ALL in counseling, so I'm doing my best to pass it on to you.  In all reality, you just ARE beating a dead horse.  IF he does NOT change his ways, I just trust & hope you'll give a LOT OF THO'T to getting away from this person who is doing absolutly NOTHING for you, & everything against you.  One day I just hope you'll come to realize just how much precious time you're in fact loosing by staying w/this complete looser.  But, you're going to have to come to realize this, but the ONE biggest thing is, you're going to have to ACCEPT this as fact.  When you do, you'll finally let it/him go, KNOW you CAN live a better life, & the day you do, you'll feel like a ton of bricks have just rolled off your shoulders.  How do I know?  I lived it!  So take it from someone who has "been there", BUT also someone who was finally able to accept these facts, & someone who FINALLY set themselves free of it all.  YES, today I'm a different person, NO ONE controls me, I will NOT allow them to.  I have FULL CONTROL of me & of my mind.  Some day I TRUST the same thing w/finally happen to you.  You CAN be happy, IF you'll just give yourself a chance & trust in yourself.  You ARE OK!!!  Please just consider ALL I've said to you.  Do consider it w/a complete open mind.  I DO wiah you all the best...:)|`|wpi36XBAaa	Go and seek the help you need. <br>  Regardless of whether its the current circumstances that are making you feel this way, or if its a mental illness, you do need some professional help to sort out this problem, and in doing so, prehaps bring the rest of your life into clearer focus.<br>  Do this now.

AA11649495	i was a virgin until i was 20. it is not bad at all. and if a guy doesnt want to be with you because of that then he is an a$$hole. you do what you feel is right when you are ready. it is your decision to make and no one elses.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	That isn't bad at all, alot of girls like it actually.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	no it is not bad at all, in fact i think that it is great!!!  im proud of you, there is no need to rush things, your virginity is a precious gift, just dont give it to anyone!!|`|1BaeFYnEaa	Well...<br>  The best solution for most girls is to do it the first time with somebody who really loves them. That means - you must have a stable relationship. Mr Right is a bit older than you, preferably not a virgin too, because it might be weird and he might not know what to do with you.<br>  Mr Right is to be kept for some time, that means, don't do it in the first months. You must see if he's a good guy and really loves you and that he doesn't want you just as a "trophy f***" (sorry, bad language). He should be a responsible person and if he'd make you uncomfortable, he'd never get angry or try to talk you into it. That means he has to respect you. Most girls fall for the talking and then those guys, who didn't respect them, may do other naughty stuff like telling others, or treat you rude, hurt your feelings, etc.<br>  There's no BAD AGE (unless it's 24+ omg). Don't worry about it, it's NOT a bad thing. People just get to think differently and have other experience in life, so you can't get a standard age for this. Don't worry. Do it when you feel it. And if you'd do it with a stranger (one night stand) go for it, BUT seriously look at him and think "do I want to remember HIM for the rest of my life?" (I hade a case similar to this and yes, that was so great!! and it went well cause I studied alot what I have to do - no I'm not a slut, since then I had 3 stable relationships that lasted for YEARS and inbetween about 5 one night stands)<br>  So whatever option you choose - remember - be really sure you want it and STOP if you feel uncomfortable.

Sometimes it's hard to choose something specific you love about someone.. You just love them! But I know I can name some myself.

I love that he thinks so out of the box. <br>  Maybe he just doesn't know how to answer these things seriously?|`|yIGVOqXdaa	I love that he is caring and puts my needs first before his, i love that he is so compassionate, i love his eyes, i love his touch, i love that i am married to the best man (in my opinion) that i could ever ask for.|`|jMLa696Taa	there are many things i like with my husband but i don't have to specify.

That's why I love her. If I tell her "I like your boobs" she will tell me "You have a cute butt, but really what do you really think?"<br>  I hope this helps you...My wife will ask me those questions after dinner or before bed, when I am relaxed and not thinking about the game or when I'm thinking of food or she will get "I like your boobs" answer.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	It's funny that you ask this, because just yesterday my hubby and I had this same conversation, and he too only gave generalized answers.

ON84EQaBaa	maybe he do just want a friendship. If the two of you hook up in a relationship and it don't work out it, he might feel like he has lost his best friend. If I were you I'd just take it slow, all good relationships starts with a friendship.
kRbkiPvnaa	People tend to do and say things that are hurtful when they are angry. She can not legally prevent you from seeing the baby as long as you are the father and are not endangering the child. It's hard to take custody from the mother in most cases though.  People argue, feelings are hurt and "Pride" causes people to stay apart.  Try to work things out with your GF, she was probably just trying to hurt you the only way she knew how, forgive her and move on with your relationship.|`|KwNpyp3saa	It's good you found out know what kind of person she is incase you were thinking of marrying her. She shouldn't use your baby as a pawn like this. If you don't pay child support then you should. This will ensure you get visitation. If you wish, you might even get custody. Make sure it is through the courts or she will act like she didn't receive anything and will make it look like you are dead beat dad. I wish the best for you.|`|AA10500537	get partial custody of the baby  before she decides to leave you|`|nwmX3QmIaa	if you don't want her to have the baby and you think she or he is in harm then go to court over the baby to get her.
cOce5YbRaa	This is a sticky situation. I was lucky with who I got with because I didn't want to have kids and neither did he so it worked out good. If I ever had kids I wanted to either adopt or get with someone who already had kids. You need to really think this over before your relationship goes any further than it has. You need to ask him why he doesn't want to have kids. He is the only one that can give you the honest answer. If he is dead set on not having kids, and you truly want kids with all your heart, you need to decide if you should stay with him or not. It's not fair to you if you want kids and it isn't fair to him if he doesn't and you get pregnant. It would probably break your relationship up. So, talk to him before it goes any further and both of you get hurt more than you already will be. Some people just don't want kids sweetie but in time he might change his mind. But do you really want to marry him and wait to see if he changes his mind or not? This is things you need to really think about. Good luck to you and I wish you the very best.|`|KwNpyp3saa	You may feel this way but it is clear HE doesn't feel the same way. Please don't entertain the idea that he will change his mind. Most people don't. It's good you found out know and not AFTER the wedding. You should cut your losses and find someone who shares your same views about raising a family.|`|00b4GnZMaa	well maybe he thinks it is too early to have a baby,my mom still tells me that when i grow up,first you get a nice house with atleast 3 bedrooms,then you find a job that you are good at and you can manage,then find a wife,then get situated,then if you want,have a baby.<br>  im only 12 but before you say anything you(asker)ask yourself is it too early,are we ready so think about this!!!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	If you two are living together and having sex, it follows that a pregnancy will eventually happen. No birth control method is 100% effective. You need to spell this out to your "boy" so he can understand it. If he really doesn't want any children at all... he has no business having sex, getting engaged or getting married. <br>  <br>  The trick to this one is to get married first, so that you two can make a baby in the normal manner without anything being in question.|`|c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	It would be respectful to have your fiancee to approve of having a baby. Although your not pregant, my advice is to test the idea with him and see how he may react. While you both are eating dinner, with a nice smile, say to him that you are pregnant. I think if you give him this test you'll get a better insight, but not only for you, your fiancee as well. God bless.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	You 2 have to settle this for real before you walk down the aisle.  Make sure that whoever gives in won't resent the other down the road.|`|AA10500537	for one thing you and him dont belong together , if one does and one doesn;t  it;ll never work

I have friends that I love but don't always like depending on how they act or treat other people. Sometimes people change during the course of a relationship and while you may love someone it doesn't mean you like them. For instance, I love my husband but I also like him. If he cheated on me, hit me or did treated me poorly I don't think I'd like him anymore and I may even divorce him. However, we have children together and have been a couple for many, many years. I really believe that no matter what happens I'd always love him, even if I stopped liking him.|`|XmudUg2aaa	Here is a good example. <br>  <br>  I love my husband...<br>  <br>  But I don't like the way that he treats me, his cruel words, lack of appreciation, that he would rather work than spend time with his family, that he takes me for granted, that he isn't as fit as he used to be, that he thinks about himself first, etc....<br>  <br>  Bascially I don't like him = don't like the things that he does and how his behavior has changed.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	you can love someone with all your heart and soul, but there might be things in the marriage or relationship they dont like, maybe the girl do like sports, going out with friends, no active, way she dress when the h/bf comes home. but if you are honest and open about everthing this can be worked out, just put everything on the table. believe me you both will feel better and the truth is known!!!|`|E0PZoHMkaa	So which is it??  Your husband or your fiance?  At any rate......this is what he gets for coming home and sharing a conversation with you that he had with another guy.  Keep questioning every word that comes out of his mouth like this and soon he won't have to be confused about which he is....husband or fiance.  He'll just be the ex to you.  I know that sounds harsh but I really don't think you want to understand what his friend meant.  I think you only care about how this applies to YOU.  I would also be willing to bet that you apply that same standard to most everything, don't you?|`|jMLa696Taa	yeah, i don't like my husband, he talk so much, he complain so much, he goes out with his friends etc..etc..etc.., i have to stay, i can't live without him, because no matter who he is, i love him, so..those things i don't like doesn't matter.  Got the picture? Love is more stronger.|`|sCCjAKllaa	He might not just favor her attitude, and the way she acts towards him. At the end of the day, though, his love will always be stronger then his dislike for her. But yeah, that's pretty much what it means to me.|`|AA10450505	LOVE - obligated to be with, provide for, keep safe.

KM9yFkeKaa	The answer is quite simple; no one will find out! <br>  See it is like this, if someone lies in your face there are aspect of their gestures that show that they are lying; for example biting lips, stuttering, playing with hair... blah blah.<br>  <br>  Online however, you don't see the person you are talking to; even if u web cam then u will most likely miss signs of tell tale. It is easier to lie online and no one; in most cases; will be any the wiser. <br>  <br>  To be more specific to your question, some people view a failed past as a label that they will mess up again and thus, try very hard to conceal it. others, will probably lie because they don't know you and don't really want everyone to know their business. Or maybe because they think you will judge them based on what the past says instead of what you see. <br>  <br>  However, despite whatever our personal sense of right and wrong says, it is ultimately up to the individual's discretion. <br>  <br>  Hope I was of some help! =)|`|GUk8FiAHaa	Online is a way you can sell yourself with little or no flaws.

c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	You do have a family. You have the love of your grandparents and your brothers. It was your mother who missed out of getting to know you. My advice is to talk to your dad parents. You should request from them to tell you some things about your dad. If they have any pictures of him, you can start a photo album of him with your brothers. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are living a good life. Your dad is looking down on you and very please with you. His photos would bring you close to him. God bless.|`|FoDDa8TNaa	That is probably one of the saddest things i have ever heard. I really don't know how to fill the emptiness, because i haven't gone through ANYTHING that horrible. I don't know if you want to do this, but therapy can always help, like my friend almost died this year, and he was my best friend like my life, and he was gone for the longest time and i felt empty too, but i went to therapy and now i just look at things different and i don't fell empty, it's worth a shot isn't it?|`|T9eHH3cjaa	I don't know if that void can ever really be filled. The space in your heart for your father is a special spot that can not be filled with meaningless relationships that in the end leaves you feeling still empty. <br>  <br>  My parents divorced when I was very young. What I remember about my father is that he was my hero and I loved him very much. Which made it even harder when I could no longer see him. I went through some very painful relationships trying to fill the void.  20 years later when I did finally meet up with him, and start a relationship with him, I had a chance to find myself and be secure with who I was. He was basically taken from me in a horrible motorcycle accident that left him with so much head trauma that he was no I deal who I am now.<br>  <br>  Protect your heart and perhaps look into joining a church or start journaling to manage your emotions when you feel sad. It couldn't hurt. Good luck!

kUE3Ddktaa	Yes, these would be super-easy to make. You'll need:<br>  <br>  - Vases (figure out how many you want per table, then multiply by the number of tables, and get a couple extra in case you break one), in the size and shape of your choosing<br>  <br>  - Stones - the ones in the photo look like natural stones and I think they're sometimes called "river rock" because they look like they've been tumbled smooth in a stream bed. Check craft stores, but also call up construction contractors and home/garden stores, because you might get a cheaper price, especially if you need a lot of them. You could also use those fancy glass marbles (they come in lots of different colors). Pour a few inches of rock into the bottom of the vase.<br>  <br>  - Flowers - the ones in the photo are orchids, which do pretty well submerged in water for long periods of time. Leave some stem on the blossom so you can tuck it into the rocks and keep the flower from floating to the top. I don't know how well silk flowers would work, because they're made of fabric. You might want to do a test vase to make sure that the flower doesn't go transparent or bleed dye into the water when it's been in there for a while.<br>  <br>  - Water, obviously. Don't overfill the vases or you won't have room for the candle. And pour slowly so you don't crush or dislodge your flower!<br>  <br>  - Floating candles. You can get these at most craft stores and many home stores (Garden Ridge-type places usually have good deals on them), or order them from the site.<br>  <br>  <br>  And to Jen - as a guest, no, I don't usually pay tons of attention to the centerpieces. But I would certainly notice if there weren't any centerpieces at all, and find it odd.|`|kj507W26aa	I had something similar. An large Oval glass dish filled with water and real fresh cut flowers floating. Mine was a day wedding. <br>  <br>  If they are going to float on top of water use real flowers, if its like in the picture, you can get away with using fake flower., stones, water and top it with water candles.|`|EJSdI25Naa	I have not seen them either. That is so pretty. I am sure that the cymbidium orchids used here would be real. But, you can use any flower. Arrange the flower and the pebbles,and then gently pour fresh water over the arrangement. Do that where you want the vases to be. It<br>  would be easier than carrying the water filled jars to place. Prepare shortly before the reception if you are having one or, for home decoration, whenever you want. The flowers will not last indefinitely underwater so toss when the slightest sign of decay becomes apparent. You can always replace with fresh.|`|KZV8p4PGaa	I say order just one kit and see what the flowers look like in person and see what materials they use and try to replicate it for cheaper.  You do not want to want to buy random things and not have a clue if they are right and how to put it together.|`|ISnJu0W3aa	Dont listen to Jen. Maybe the weddings she has been to just havent put as much effort into their details. I would certainly notice if there was someting that pretty on the table i was sitting at. <br>  <br>  I think they are gorgeous. What a great idea. Good luck for the special day =)|`|3MDY29gnaa	Yes they are square cylinder you can use silk flowers, stones and a floating candle|`|r3ZBSMwYaa	Yes, of course you can! There are numerous other sites like this as well that you should browse. And yes, guests certainly do notice and pay attention to the details of the tables' centerpieces. For one thing, sometimes as things lag a bit, it gives a guest something interesting to look at and enjoy. Just a hint; if you do use rocks/stones or marbles/glass, check out a pet store for the rocks/gravel/glass because it's a lot cheaper, comes in bulk, and doesn't obviously run when wet. Although this was for a company holiday party (we had a $25K budget for about 165 people) we still wanted to do something more unique and I asked the pet store and they were glad to order some beautiful stones that they didn't feature on the store floor and they gave a bit of a discount as well. Please, do not neglect the centerpieces; each and every table that will have guests seated at it needs one.

282b63c09da8e149a4194accaf494760aa	There is always a pursuer and distancer in relationships. When things are not working, we have to try something else. As you said things 'seem bad right now'...I would back off and be less available. I would communicate less and let her miss you. You also could try just being friends and treat her to a special dessert out or some gift you know she would like. Pay attention to her feelings and let her know you are listening to her feelings by saying them back to her in an empathetic and understanding way. Very few men understand women need this. I would say, "it seems you are ambivalent about getting attached (or limiting yourself to one person) right now, is that right?"<br>  She may be more comfortable with distance in the relationship because of the way she grew up. You may be engulfing her when you are with her and she needs some comfortable space. I would ask her why it is 'not that easy' or 'how is she stopping herself' from getting back with you as a last resort.|`|XWUPdFjoaa	you should tell her about how you feel about her and how strongly that you do ask her if she really wants it or if she just wants you as like a boodie call cuz thats what it seems like she wants mors then a relationship i would be carefull about it because it suck to be hurt over some thing like this but you have to be open to her and honest about everthing|`|5VXm2Cc8aa	some people string people along until something better comes along or they dont want someone else to have what they dont want for that moment go with your instincts being pulled with strings can hurt and can be with you for a long time ive been there a year ago and it still haunts me|`|R3DxlK0xaa	I have a friend that strings her exs along ...just in case she need them for later. All she is doing is using them and they happen to care enough that they allow themselves to be used. Don't be that guy. Move on. And then there are they girls that will string you til you move on and then all of a sudden you are the cats meow you are all they ever wanted til you come back and  then you are right where they want you just following them like the little puppy they want you to be. Be your own man. Move on.|`|TPYPZECQaa	She could be leading you along because she's afraid if she tells you otherwise, she could possibly lose your friendship. I've been in a situation before when a guy told me we would be really good friends if i ever told him I just wanted to be friends. And I did, and now he hates me. So, even though you say you won't be mad, there's always that possible fear of you getting angry. Try to talk it out with her, and tell her she needs to tell you how she really feels, because you can't wait around for ever if she doesn't want a relationship right now. It's really not all that easy to tell people "how" to move on. You do it at your own pace, on your own time. The best advice I have is to see what you like, get to know other girls. It'll help you to not think about your ex as much.|`|CvESLNnkaa	exs are usually exs for a good reason.
c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	I really believe it is sign of affection. She loves and cares about you so much that she wants take care of you. I think she really enjoy cleaning your room. When you have some extra cash buy her a small gift and hide it in your room. When she cleans your room and finds the gift with her name on it, it would very romantic. It would also show the manhood in you because you know how to treat female.You shouldn't feel guilty at all. God bless.|`|AA12060541	Guilty, No, but ask her to wait for you and ya'll will do it together!|`|VygBNA0Waa	yes because you look like a fat lazy slob how stupid is she what do you do for her wipe your bum so there is no skid marks|`|AA11739944	Yes, I would never date someone that made me do that stuff.

After puttin' another load in, I moseyed on over to his computer to see what everyone said. <br>  <br>  The person that said I'm stupid and he's a jerk, well...I supposed you might have an argument of half-truth there.<br>  <br>  Tony, I like you're answer best. :)<br>  <br>  The do it for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the guy is incompetent when it comes to clothes washing. Sometimes he won't even put detergent in the god forsaken wash machine. And he mixes the fabric softener with the detergent which just defeats the whole purpose.<br>  <br>  If he does utilize the the detergent and fabric softener correctly, he won't bother taking the clothes out of the wash and they'll just sit there and get moldy.<br>  <br>  If he makes it far enough to where he actually sticks 'em in the dryer, where therein lies yet another problem. He'll leave 'em in there for a inconceivable long amount of time and they'll get wrinkled.<br>  <br>  In short, if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Another thing is, I don't like living in squalor. So if I see that my environment, the immediate area around me is dirty and cluttered, I set it out to correct it. It does something for my chi, I dunno.  <br>  <br>  And I'm one of those anal, overly efficient people, where if I start something, I must do it correctly and thoroughly. And on top of that, I do love him and I do like to help him out. Gotta go add the fabric softener. ;)|`|fb3Rvoe5aa	heLL no tahts what we are for.. sexy slaves.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No|`|KwNpyp3saa	If you care about her and are not using her then I don't think you should feel guilty.

PfE6bg5iaa	haha, yes there are a lot of people here that have trouble with the "their", "there" and "they're"<br>  <br>  So I agree with you, it all seems a little crazy to me too. There's just different degrees of Bridezilla, but I have yet to meet a bride who wasn't stressed about her wedding not going as planned. Saving all that money to start your lives together seems more reasonable and realistic to me.<br>  <br>  We plan on getting married at the courthouse and then having a very small party for family only afterwards. We're both college students (in engineering) with student loans piling up and we just can't justify spending all that time and, most importantly, money on a day of partying. We'd rather save the money, have our small party, and go on a nice honeymoon because we love to travel.|`|ISnJu0W3aa	As weddings are a long standing tradition, respected by anyone who takes relationships seriously and undertaken by those who wish to share their joy of finding their soulmate in this large world by celebrating in a small or large gathering with close friends and family im sure you will understand why most people will agree your opinion is wrong.<br>  <br>  Also such a big deal is made of it (and mainly for the woman) because back in the day a womans life began when she got married. She was no longer a burden to her parents, she got her own household to run and started a family. <br>  <br>  Surely you cant begrudge a woman just because she wants to put effort into celebrating the day in her life where she commits herself to her partner and him to her? Its a day you remember and celebrate every year until death do you part.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different but wouldnt you want your day to be your kind of special?|`|AA12357988	Wow, aren't you a little bit stuck up and snarky?<br>  <br>  Weddings are fun.  You (hopefully) only get one, and it is the couple's day, but most men just want their women to have it exactly how they like.  Just because you don't care, doesn't mean it is wrong for others.  Stop being so narrow-minded.|`|d3icrU62aa	because as little girls, we all watched disney and most disney princesses are waiting for their prince charming blah blah blah...you can deny the connection but there has to be a link.|`|l43NSgHyaa	There are a lot of difference reasons and I feel there is not issue with women or girls obssessing about getting married.  In fact, in a society where people are so negative about marriage, it's good to see that young girls and their parents (usually their mothers) are encourage marriage and starting a family, as opposed to having a negative attitude about men, dating, relationships, etc.    I think so to a certain extent, it shows that a girls are growing into a heathly women with a healthy outlook on marriage.    As opposed to teaching girls that marriage isn't a positive thing.  I wish more fathers and husbands would teach the same to their sons.   <br>  <br>  As for planning from a young age, I never really did that.  I did play wedding with my Barbies and dolls, but I never specifically dreamed of my own wedding from an early age.The first time I thought about my own wedding was when I was about 13 years old and I saw a wedding spread in a magazine. <br>  <br>  Honestly,  I didn't think about my own wedding, in a real context until a few years ago.   I will admit, I dreamed about it and planned it before it was even a reality.    But, I'm OK with that.   A wedding is about SO many things.   It's about getting to dress up for one day and feeling extra special.   How many times in a woman's lifetime is she going to put on a really expensive dress and get her hair and makeup done like a celebrity walking the red carpet?    Probably, twice--her prom and her wedding.   So, in regrets to that, why not go big or go home with the dress and all the trimmings.<br>  <br>  The second aspect of the wedding and dreaming is the fact that getting married is probably the second biggest committment you'll ever make.  The first is having children.  So, a wedding is such a HUGE event, when you think about it in the context of your life.   So, a wedding does deserve a lot of time and attention. <br>  <br>  Lastly, to address the money topic; I do think spending money on a wedding is well worth it, as long as you don't go in over your head.   But, weddings need to be looked at from an emotional and social standpoint.   Emotionally, this is a big day in your life and your spouse's life.   You're making a lifelong committment to someone and usually, you're doing so after years of dating and being with each other.  So, you're celebrating the fact that you're both finally husband and wife and the fact that you've made it to this point in your relationship.   It's the start of something new, wonderful, life-changing and long lasting.   Sounds like a great reason to host a really big party and let everyone come and join in the celebration and a new family!   <br>  <br>  Plus, for me anyway, I'm having my ceremony in a Church.  I'm Catholic too and getting married is a really big celebration in any Catholic family.   So, like Baptisms and First Communions, a Wedding is followed by a big party. It's about spending time with your new family and celebrating something really sacred, a marriage and a bond between two people.    To me, if you're marrying in a Church and making a huge commitment in front of God and your family, how is that not worth of a big party and lots of attention to detail.<br>  <br>  Then, you have the social aspect.  A wedding is a party like any other and it costs time and money to plan.   So, if you're having a big wedding or you have a large family, it's more than justifiable to spend money on feeding and hosting them.   Feeding 150 or 200 people isn't cheap, but in some cases, if that's the size of your family, how do you say "NO" to having them.   Are you really going to let money stand in the way of celebrating with your family?   I wouldn't!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand why some of us really, really love our wedding and plan to spend lots of money and time on it.  For me, it's a combination of things, including  the love I have for my new spouse, the religious and cultural significance of marriage and our families!     Also, I do see it as "my day" to get to dress up and be a little glam queen for the day.     But, it's "our day" in terms of the commitment and vows, which is most important.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long.   But, I think you can learn something from this.   It's OK to want to the perfect everything at your wedding, if you do it for the right reasons.   Plus, you refer to marriage in such a morbid way, you "decided to enter a legal contract with a man"    Ohhhhh boy......that's a bit sad, it's not a contract, it's a committment and you're not business partners, you're husband and wife.     Hopefully, you'll see there is a lot of reasons to celebrate your wedding (and in style).|`|GaHkxtU9aa	The reason why they want it to be a big deal is because a wedding gives a woman a chance to shine, a chance to feel special, a chance to be adored by her man, and a chance to feel like a princess. Its her chance to show off to her friends and to be the centre of attention.<br>  <br>  As a guy i say let the girl have her moment - let her feel loved and to feel special. Let her feel like a Queen - even for just a day - although she should feel like that everyday. A bit of harmless fun in life - nothing wrong with it. Dont even try to rationalise it - its not possible. Its called love.|`|byd1bd0Haa	This subject differs in opinions.<br>  <br>  The most stereotypical answer would be that it's one of their most important days and they want it to be something they can remember for the rest of their lives.|`|WvBgXv5daa	Its there day<br>  they know that you can only live your life once so why not make one day a fantasy!|`|ubAPZjp5aa	women are obsessed with there wedding because it a day for two people that want to be together forever and spend the rest of there life with that person|`|2f4f2f5ea8596fff714cd6078c95b937aa	I feel exactly like you.|`|AA11208986	becz  thats there day thats why they  worry too muchh|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I am wondering why you are so bitter about the topic? If you personally dont care, then why are you letting it bother you?<br>  Some woman as little girls dream of this day, and some dont. Some men are very involved in the wedding planning process, and some men aren't, I think your question in itself is really biased.<br>  <br>  I never really dreamed in detail of my wedding day as a child, but when I met my fiance, I dreamed of walking down the isle. dreamed of the dress, dreamed about his smile as I got to him, but it isn't "my" day, its our day, and I think for the majority of the other woman getting married, it isn't just about them either<br>  <br>  I think men sometimes aren't to great at picking colors, so the woman does, and the men shouldn't have anything to do with picking the wedding dress, and us woman enjoy sharing the joy and the planning with those around us, it isn't that our men dont want to do it, or dont think its important, but really, my fiance would MUCH prefer I do the leg work, and consult him for opinions later, plus the planning is something I enjoy doing.|`|oT71QN8Raa	Most girls don't think of it as a "contract" with a man.  Most girls see it as the day she gave her whole heart to one person, one person who will keep that heart safe forever.  I personally have not had my wedding planned out since I was two.  I recently got engaged, and although I know for the most part what I want for my big day, I dont have anything concrete in mind.  The thought that it needs to be completely perfect comes from the idea that if the first day of the rest of your life with someone doesn't go well, whats that say about the days and years to come?  There's nothing wrong with wanting such a special day to be perfect.<br>  <br>  ...I just saw your additions - Men don't like planning things, as a rule.  Really, most men do not mind letting the women plan everything.  The biggest reason that its seen as the woman's day and not the man's is because the woman's parents pay for everything, the woman typically plans it and everything centers around the woman.  The man doesnt walk down the isle, the woman does.  Its tradition.  As for me, I am including my man in the planning, because he has things he wants.  And I want him to have those things.  It is his day too, and I really want him to be happy.|`|KZV8p4PGaa	Well some people are happy to celebrate the moment they are committing themselves to one person they are in love with for the rest of their lives in front of God and/or friends and family.  I was not the person who thought about it before I got engaged, but was very excited to dress up and I LOVE cake!  That was what was exciting for me on our wedding.  I do agree some people obsess though.  I had a friend who bought a dress before they met one of their boyfriends and bought one when she met a guy.  Unfortunately she was 2 months shy of wearing them when he decided he did not love her and was seeing someone else a week later.|`|AA11074230	I see your point!<br>  So many people seem to care more about having a wedding than having a marriage.<br>  As long as many girls are raised with the unfortunate idea that getting married is the ultimate goal for women and the most important thing she can do, this mindset will prevail.<br>  But then, I'm guilty of it sometimes, too.<br>  <br>  *edit* and that their, there, they're disclaimer should be on every question!|`|KtbhcmSraa	First of all take a breath. There is where the wedding may be, Their's could be a decision, and they're either going to have a great wedding and life or if it is the way you describe, most likely not!

But she is my wife and I am her husband and we both put each other first.... Good luck to you. You sound like you are venting a little through this question?|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	its more than just legal.  theres emotions, and blending of families and all sorts of other stuff.  its more than just the coming together of a couple its the coming together of two families, and a celebration of a very important time in a couples lives<br>  <br>  idk.  ive been to a grand total of three weddings in my 22 years on this planet, whcih isnt a lot of weddings, and i totally get it...if you dont, im really not sure what to say.<br>  <br>   its also probably one of the last times ill ever have to put on a dress that fancy.  prom happend and then theres just a whole gap of time where i dont get to get that fancy ever again.  it will also be the first time my fiance ever sees me that fancy, so im excited
Jk9jPNeLaa	I get what you mean. <br>  <br>  By you stating "yeah I had braces in middle school, they suck", she thinks that you are trying to take attention away from her or trying to rub it in that you had braces before her. let her be like that! she is just excited about getting braces and wants to let everyone know, but later on when she gets over it, she will realise how much of an idiot she looked like.. hahaha|`|bkoLnIYXaa	yes i cant stand that! or when they tell you bout wat they are goin to do (in your case your friend getting her braces) and you try to tell them bout your personal experience and they just say ok and change the subject back to them. i hate that! lol|`|jXB2Wy4Baa	ahahaha, yeahh. i think it's super annoying too.<br>  and when people are like "lol" or "yeah" & then that's it.<br>  it bothers the crap out of me!|`|YhYSZlroaa	I feel the exact same way! Especially when txting cause it become like a one way conversation! But yah I feel the same way...|`|IRv1Rgdhaa	OMG I hate that **** soooo bad, omg it IS annyoing, it make u feel like they're not intersted and they dont wanna talk to you like a real friends would, it bothers me toooo!!|`|ewOD5x0taa	It is aggravating.|`|5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	That is why children cannot use correct spelling. Yes it does annoy me.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	find smarter friends.|`|aVSIxv0waa	I wouldn't say EXTREMELY annoying, but yeah, it bugs me.<br>  <br>  What's even worse is when you're texting someone and they just randomly stop in the middle of the conversation, or just don't reply at all. I'm like "What the hell?"|`|42DvP1AEaa	ha ha yea I defiantly feel the same way. at least its better than just "k". if I get k or ok as an response it usually ends the conversation for me.<br>   <br>  pretty much there ok should be banned from texting...don't waste my tests, even if I am unlimited lol|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	Yeah that annoys me too, also when people answer "yep" it annoys me because it sounds kinda rude in text...almost a little sarcastic.|`|ATxouncLaa	i find that really annoying to i mean like wat am i to say to ok know what i am saying|`|qmnqXSqlaa	Yeeahh !<br>  Omgg i hate that so mcuh to <br>  Just be happy n start a convo<br>  screw the ok<br>  but i no its annoying but w/e|`|68a92b6a7f2b4d1216b4a6c095a54916aa	I understand what you mean but sometimes people either dont feel like texting a long text or they dont really know what to say.<br>  <br>  But it bugs me too.<br>  haha:)|`|qOTTt7mhaa	Yeah, i hate that.<br>  <br>  Stuff just like 'ok' 'lol' 'i c' ... it's annoying.|`|t8jXt395aa	ya man. That makes me annoyed too. Like gosh say something more! Ha|`|eHcXI4jFaa	ok|`|uvVMe2oDaa	ok|`|a4212be8d71ac02831257e9e70bec87daa	omg i hate that it seems like they don't wanna talk to you and they're just saying ok so u leave them alone|`|9b3xkt36aa	I'm so glad i didn't have too, ya know, like listen, ya know to this crap like FOR SURE sodja boi|`|HZGkUf4iaa	i know, my friends do that to me all the time|`|Gd9t9D4raa	i kno i hate that...its like they rudely end the conversation and dont wanna hear wut u have to say...|`|WhO1j091aa	i hate one word answers too cause then you feel like the person doesnt want to talk to you|`|zNOstTOJaa	wow|`|ZIejKWplaa	Haha, I feel annoyed when I get that too sometimes.<br>  <br>  I also hate it when people just say "lol" because they don't have anything else to say to your conversation. Especially if it's something you want to seriously talk about. D:<br>  <br>  haha, so most of the time I just respond with an 'ok' or 'lol' back. <br>  But it is annoying to me. DX|`|Kqsbbc0faa	its not extremely annoying, maby she just didnt care what you had to say. lol.. not 2 be harsh.<br>  but my friend does that to me .. just "ok" and im like wtf? no reply?<br>  but dont let it get on ur nerves, there is a WHOLE lot of stuff to be thinking about :)|`|ArfWE7Zlaa	i agree i usually change topic, or call them stupid. and then start only saying "lol ya" to everything they say. i swear you can carry out a whole conversation with that one phrase.|`|7TyCfvrIaa	me to its like they dnt wann tlk to you and it gts kinda anoyin and the convo ends up fading and then its like hey wtf lol but yes it is verrry anoying i hate it also D:|`|MulZfdzQaa	Its YOU. I can tell by how you type you are probaby overly enthusiastic. And you talk way too much. And you were annoying her so she said ok so you could Shut the Hell up.|`|jCaRmU5naa	yeah i find that annoying tooo!!!|`|K8JLYri8aa	tell her to shut the heck up she should stop it not slap her|`|xgui1LAFaa	i understand, like when they say "ok" as in they dont care...|`|b7dp2PlHaa	yeah haha|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	It can be annoying but you have to remember when you text someone you are reaching them while they are doing something else.  She could have been busy or out or distracted.  Or should could have just not known what to say.|`|tuXBPrjsaa	lol wow....|`|mR9ydwz5aa	yes. i completely agree with you. it makes it seem like they dont want to talk to you. even an lol would make it better...|`|zSpFXIrfaa	holy  **** i hate that too
c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	Personally I would want to know before the first date. I don't think it shows immaturity to want to know the whole situation beforehand. That said, if I really liked the person it wouldn't necessarily stop me from going on the date. I just feel like they should be honest beforehand so you know that they're "testing the waters" and aren't focused 100% on you.|`|74gPuaXMaa	Before me and my girlfriend got into a relationship, she was apparently also dating someone else. She told me a few days ago that she dated another guy before we got together, but stopped talking to him before we did. I don't have a problem with it, because nothing is exclusive until you say you're in a relationship. If she told me on the first or 2nd date, it would have been awkward. I just have to assume I'm competing against others guys, which I was. I won, and I'm with a wonderful girl now. :)|`|RiRA86psaa	If a girl is dating others I would not want her. I would want to know before I dated her.|`|qmlgXXYaaa	im only 16 so im not pro at this or anything, but i would rather wait to find out. seriously, why ruin the fin of jsut plain getting to know the person, by having them tell you you've dated a million girls (and who know what happened). if i knew more information and had a connection with my date, and we accually clicked (if ya know what i mean) i know i'd be more forgiving for that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|LZ1CNOhtaa	I would want to know.  If they get upset its perfectly normal . it doesnt mean they are not mature. some people do not like to date around and date multiple people.|`|d057d4b205afdf38f32252a846ee418baa	yes|`|2456c64a5133009717e218e7364993a5aa	I agree I don't think its that important on a first or second date. If there is chemistry and a connection and you continue dating I would think it would be safe that the two would just end up dating one another........... however that being said that would mean 2 people that are looking for a relationship and not just looking to date or be a player.|`|OBpOp9CEaa	I agree with you completely.<br>  Isn't the point of dating so you can see multiple people anyway?
23f7be6415d7965c88f38a51d089c640aa	ATTEND DISCO PARTY.|`|pJZBdpehaa	BUY HIM WORLD OF WARCRAFT.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	when im kissing my husband i go suck on his ear lobe and breathe in his ear, lol that does the trick for me :)|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Suprise him by looking super hot, or looking hot in a way that he has never seen you before. Like if you always wear your hair in a ponytail, wear it down in soft curls, or if you never wear makeup, then wear some shimmery eye shadow, mascara and pink lipgloss. Also, dress up a bit for him, let him know that you appreciate him. He'll think it's super hot!|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	you should put on some sexy outfit schoolgirl ..secretary... cop etc .....and oill upo ur body........yum!..i know that does it for me.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you have to become a straight **** for one night....i mean it is your man|`|7VxNpWepaa	honey, use your imagination and have fun.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	be aggressive. that's great advice. i have a suggestion.<br>  <br>  give him a sitting backrub. guys love this kind of attention. and then take a handful of lotion and put your hands down his jeans. <br>  <br>  it'll be messy, and thoughtful. something guys secretly LOVE. lol.<br>  <br>  yeah, you could give him oral. but don't do that unless you're prepared for a long haul. finish what you start.<br>  <br>  or maybe...  you could turn him into a sundae. it'll give him all kinds of fantasy fulfillment, and it's a good reason to get your tongue on him.<br>  <br>  just being here asking for advice shows what a sweetheart you are. and he'll love whatever you come up with.|`|Jk9jPNeLaa	my boyfriend loves it when i just spring a surprise make-out session on him. for eg, if we're just watching tv, i'll just roll over, throw my arms around his neck and kiss him passionately. that progresses into a hot make-out session. trust me, guys love it! lol|`|c32aCqwqaa	bite his ears, grind on him, dirty talk him...basically act really slutty and pay attention to him alot also make lots of noise during sex and moan alot but a sexy moan not like and elephant moan|`|PaPXlWwIaa	bite him, my bf likes it rough and so do a lot of guys.<br>  get some chocolate syrup and whipped cream.|`|XLBwRZjDaa	rape him! lol just kidding. steal a kiss real rough like. and then tell him you wanna celebrate your love.|`|DDT3rZasaa	some nice lingerie and lap dance.|`|J3baiqqhaa	grab his dick, idiot|`|DbNrYtCWaa	f*** him real good|`|KjqqaOCwaa	first off, you should see if anyone else already asked this question cause i answered it yesterday and got the best answer....so i'll just repost it for you.<br>  <br>  men are generally turned on visually, though i myself enjoy all types of simulation. wear something flattering or even exposing, underwear wise. even better, don't wear any underwear at all. <br>  <br>  men have alot of erogenous zones, pretty much our entire bodies. try tracing a line from the base of the neck right above the collar bone to the top of the ear with kisses or the tip of your tongue. if you know how he likes to be kissed (if you've ever necked) then just do it that way, but don't be random. the line tracing thing gets me every time, it's a little secret mom's should tell their daughters about<br>  <br>  if you two are of a comparable size, or if you are smaller than he is, be on top of him when you fool around. this leaves his hands and eyes free to see and touch all of you, plus make it easier to get any part of your clothes that you wish to take off, off. of course, if you and he are gonna make love you can do it any way you want. but for making out and feeling up? be on top, it'll be easier for him to access any part of you he wants.<br>  <br>  props are also fun. offer him a or back rubmessage and if your hands aren't that strong or you're not experienced giving a message, use baby oil or some other kind of lubricant and turn it into a rub down. baby oil (or whatever you use) will allow your fingers to slip through his flesh, reducing friction meaning you won't have to squeeze so hard. <br>  <br>  consider the enviroment. do you dance at all? have a favorite song that makes you feel sexy? if so, play it and move around for him. give him a show. <br>  <br>  just a few ideas that usually do it for me. those things turn me on, and most every man i know too. give it a try. love, and more importantly, sex, is about the journey, not the destination.<br>  <br>  and please remember! this is most important. clean and groom thouroughly. don't just brush your teeth but floss and rinse as well. make sure any area of your body that you shave is smooth. don't get dressed up to the hilt before you see him, but wear something as cute as you can without the folks going hey, "you look like a tramp." brushing your hair is good enough, no need to do it like you're fresh out of the salon cause its gonna get tussled anyway. a little bit of make up goes along way. unless he's some kind of freak, he doesn't want you looking like you been up for four days without cleaning and grooming, much less your breath or body smelling like it.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|qWknXgDqaa	Well pull him close and kiss him to start things off, what i mean by that is to for example ...if your both standing by his bed or a couch, just pull his shirt toward you to kiss you and then lower yourself to the bed and pull him on you lol works everytime with my bf ,, or if hes laying down ill just start kissing him a certain way. lol its kinda our code but anyway jst try different things, im sure he will get the hint lol|`|Mz8tua19aa	lol at the grind comment. too funny and yes it does work.. BUT you dont want to be a whore .. and if he is into you anything u can do will, satisfy him. no need to worry men are easy to please trust me i am a man. lol good luck|`|H2Jf1WIxaa	Do a striptease. Get a sexy school girl uniform and do a little dance shake watcha momma gave to you lol. He'll probably luv it...I know I would.|`|fge1BITraa	Rocks, IN the socks.<br>  put on AC/DC, place socks next to speakers.

8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	give him some space...<br>  <br>  if he wants to speak to you again...he will...|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I would apologize to him in person. Ask him if you could meet him...do this in person. If he refuses, then let him be. If he really wants to stay your friend, he will eventually speak with you.|`|TNOQk3Fjaa	he sounds like he doesnt know what he wants himself. I wouldnt tex him again you did say sorry at least what more does he expect you to do get on your hands and knees and beg? just let him be he will come around otherwise I wouldnt worry about it|`|71VRvldJaa	You apologized and he didn't respond.  No response is your answer!  It would appear you went too far this time and he's had enough.  Why would you text him?  To apologize a second time?  One apology is enough....don't grovel!|`|RETpCHipaa	well if you appologized then he should have replied. maybe text him again and ask if he's ok.|`|J3baiqqhaa	lol no|`|tA1ztvXaaa	leave him alone and move on, men do this **** all the time unfortunately we have so much technology they no longer know how to face a woman and break up the proper, if you text him trust me he got it, he is just be a man ***** and ignoring you so you can feel horrible, that way he can be a coward, and a jerk while you feel bad for something so small an issue,  don't be surprised if you hear from him like six weeks from now swearing he never got the message.  the texting, email, voicemail is such a cowards, way to end the relationship.  just don't be stupid and fall for it|`|fg2xU6Z2aa	well honey it would help me more if i had the whole story. but i can work with this!<br>   first off if he said that about you then he aint a very good friend! right?<br>  second you shouldnt apologize for something he did! or said! just ignore him for a while and when ur around friend dont mention him act like you dont know who he is or he exists if he is really your friend he will text you back|`|BaG8yeVVaa	the only reason why hes texting you say whats going on, is because he wants to know your not with another guy. Dont bother with this guy he seems like a drama queen! Best of luck hun!|`|INLQHsl7aa	yes u should.or just call him, or go to his house and explain everything and say that u sorry. but if he still dont forgive u for whatever u've done then just try to be nice to him.|`|gVtmEsG9aa	He sounds annoying!<br>  <br>  find a guy who loves you not a guy who hurts you.|`|DmzZ7vPgaa	NO!!!!!!!! thats a big mistake to text him again.<br>  tell him to F*ck him self|`|7TUMfYpeaa	Give him some time. You have apologized, now it's his turn.|`|NbUwThM4aa	what a drama king. show him you don't need to put up with his little show and maybe he'll show you some respect.|`|AA11767766	It'd be better if you just called and apoligized, or went there in person<br>  Unless you did something to make him truly mad<br>  <br>  That happened with one of my friends once and she kept trying to text me and call me but I was so fed up with her I ignored them<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|t8jXt395aa	yah. Text him again. Just tell him that you care about him and that you want to know if he's okay cause he didn't text you back. But if he is being all two faced like that he really doesn't sound like a good person.|`|d07861561c1ae1f3be24fc58fcebdcf5aa	no i wouldnt text him again. wait and see if he comes around and if not then there is nothing u can do i mean u already said sorry. as for him texting ur friends he is just wanting info or something around toi that|`|HmLhcO8Waa	he doesnt seem worth it cuz hes making everything all complicated|`|qRTz09pgaa	He's super ticked at you. Approach him in person and appologize.|`|CD83zn9paa	tell the boy in person ur srry nd if he doesnt take it hes a lil wuus..4get about it..stop txtin him and get off his bumper|`|tLnqleoZaa	O welll maybe he is growing up. Apologize again|`|r9NAUyGwaa	I would apologize in person. <br>  Good luck girl : )|`|Ul9AAeiFaa	i don't understand? what's the whole story?
VWvI5RyBaa	Don't worry, I'm sure she doesn't love you at all, so I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  Like a lot of people, she's probably addicted to the internet chatting.  I'm sure she talks to a lot of friends on line and tell all of them the same thing.  Stop worrying about it.|`|8SEVTKz5aa	who nos<br>  online chat is like =/ dont trust it too much|`|qOTTt7mhaa	People on the Internet can be the easiest people to talk to, since it's not in person, and there's a lot more tension in person. On the Internet, you can say what you want to say, how to say it, etc. You get to think... If you only know eachother through the computer, then maybe she doesn't know the full you, as in all the negative things about you you said? I don't know, I'm a girl, but I am not her. <br>  <br>  She might not be desperate, perhaps you're just easier to talk to, and she likes that. I don't think it's weird to be so close to someone over the Internet, but if you feel as if she's getting too clingy, tell her to back off a little I guess.|`|qySznFXaaa	dont expect to be getting laid by her.  you guys are now officially friends|`|hTieELhTaa	i would say really lonely. Well are you really lonely is that why you keep talking to her for all these years?|`|74tr4nYeaa	they see u as a girl  meaning ur not going to hit on her !!! ur a girlfriend|`|c9miD5mbaa	she probably finds you comforting because you advise her when/how she needs to be advised therefore she loves you and even the bitterest show without knowing just think there's probably a couple out there that argues every day of there life and are totally differences so just think SHE LOVES YOU FOR WHATS INSIDE NOT HOW YOU ACT.|`|AJ0StZrgaa	Some things can't be explained. Plus, I'm guessing you're pretty much the only one who thinks you're condescending and bitter and all the rest. Is it really that hard to believe she likes talking to you? Most people do find comfort in talking to their friends.|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	Probably just the fact that you are there. Like Answers, that comforting too. It's always there. Also, about the brain damage and desperation part, that counts for you too, you know. You two have been keeping each other company for 3+ years.|`|Dgov0fYYaa	You truly are not condescending, bitter, cynical, caustic, or misanthrope, you only think so.|`|d5fQPiN6aa	She probably likes you. LIKE like you.
0tGXQQ1zaa	In your new house, set up the phone lines and telephones, internet, etc FIRST!! Also, put in the toilet paper on the holders: it's SO much easier to understand why when you actually move into the house...assuming you go back and forth frequently.  You may want to set up your wardrobe and kitchen things in your new home as well: just the basics, until you move in!  Bring some things over each time you visit your new house, so that you will have less to move on moving day.  and LABEL LABEL LABEL!  It helps beyond belief.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.<br>  <br>  and dont ask who he likes. because he will think tha|`|WvBgXv5daa	reask him
1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Art projects are always fun.<br>  <br>  Something I do with my kids is to write our own story books.  First, we'll come up with a simple story.  It can be something that's happened to one of them, something they'd like to happen to them, or something silly they just make up.<br>  <br>  Then we draw pictures together to illustrate the book.  The four year old may not be old enough to draw recognizable pictures yet, but I'm sure he can color.  The seven year old is old enough to practice writing the captions.<br>  <br>  At the end, you staple the book together.  You can read the book from time to time.  It's also a really cool keepsake for you of all the time you spent with them when they were little.<br>  <br>  Cooking projects are also fun.  Kids love to bake cookies and brownies and such.  They also love getting to eat them at the end!  If you're old enough to cook, it could help your parents a lot if the three of you pitched in and cooked dinner for your family once or twice a week.<br>  <br>  If they're "hands-on" kind of boys, you could try talking your parents into buying some models to build together.  You could build forts in your living room (but make sure to clean them up before your mom gets home!)  You could also watch some movies, read books, or do special projects that benefit your family.  It may not sound fun at first to, say, clean the house, but if you seem excited about doing something nice like that for your mom, they'll feel excited too and you can all feel proud when you've done something that makes your parent's day a little easier.  Little acts of love like that have a way of drawing families closer together.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, they'll be happy just spending time with you whatever you're doing.|`|KwNpyp3saa	Try making your own play dough.

1rp9JpAyaa	All I can suggest for you is that if you love friend number 2 the most, then go for him. True love and relationships take time to blossom and you should stick with friend number 2 for a little bit longer. Try, if possible, to get him back on his feet to where he was before he went to jail and let him know you'll be there for him no matter what. If that doesn't work, then try exploring the world because your still young and I'm sure there are plenty of men out there for you.|`|AA10936527	I totally agree with Zap!|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Since guy 1 cant make u happy, forget about him, hes too old to change his ways. Now about guy 2, I think you should stick with him and heres why. He may be a broke azz jailbird but his love may be exactly what you need. I suggest humbling yourself and realizing that true love doesnt usually come with 68k, especially when the economy cuts half those jobs anyways. I wouldnt worry about his jail time unless he has a history of being in and out of jail. For now, money is out of the question for you. I dont think you know what love really is. If you really want to love guy 2, be  a sugar moma.|`|AA11179568	ummm you are really confused<br>  but why dont you try none of them <br>  i think you're not contented with both of them<br>  why not forget both and try something new<br>  if you're still not contented with someone new<br>  maybe you're just not contented with life itself<br>  then try to be happy|`|AA11618629	Best advice though childish- don't listen to my advice or anyone else here. Cause there is no way we can possibly get a fuller picture than you, even if you spend a novel of writing on your relationship with the two.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you like a man with class and the finer things in life. Your aiming high for the rare, trophy husbands are we? Is absolutely fine if you are, just drop them both and stay open. But before you go that far, is a trophy guy really one you want? << which is like saying "I want the majority voted best," or do you want something else?<br>  <br>  "I should want someone that makes what I make or more!" <<< keyword 'should', your sub conscience reviews a lot more than you would think, so money is not high on the list.<br>  <br>  "Yes I like rough/edgey men!" <<<not one slip up of confidence, your sub conscience did not intervene, meaning this is one of your high points.<br>  <br>  In conclusion cross off money, but you want a rough, strong, contrast in men. Which both seem to miss. If your in your 30's you still got ~50 years, depends if you want wait

Alot of men dont like to talk about things. Tell your husband you dont to have a more open relationship and you want to be able to talk more opening about things. It could be worse though, he could be too involved in your life and watch your every move. your husband just seems like your typical guy. if your parents are telling you it could be your fault then listen to them because they hear both sides of the story. Also you need to get rid or your anger issues and regvengfullness or he'll end up leaving. it sounds like you have more problems than he does|`|ucVgUcDvaa	You have made him clam up. He is guarded against your issue's. He wants you to talk with, not to him. You have communication problems. If you want to learn to communicate with your husband and have him open up you will need to get professional help. He has tried to tell you by saying "be normal" that he wants more also. But frankly revenge, frankness, and anger are not signs of a strong, tough woman. And I wouldn't want to have much to do with someone who spoke like that either. They are signs of insecurity, immaturity, and other issues.<br>  Good Luck!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Wow! Talk about opposites eh? Try using that to your advantage. It might be a challenge at first, but here's my suggestion.<br>  <br>  Role Reversal. You do what he does (not talking) and he does what you do (communicating). How do you think he'll fare? How do you think you'd do with it?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you married and setup a familiar dynamic.<br>  <br>  They tell me that 'no communication, no relationship' is the rule, but the fact is, we cannot NOT communicate. He communicates through a non-verbal communication style. This is probably so familiar to you, yet it is annoying isn't it?

fudPrZTyaa	No. If you are an American citizen, you will have to file a fiancee' visa for her. Of course you have to prove that you have a relationship with this girl. Then she will have 90 days to enter the country and get married to you once the visa is approved. Then you can file a green card for her, which the first 2 yrs will be a conditional, and you will be able to renew it after these 2 yrs to a "permanent status", which will be valid for 10 yrs. Then after being married with you for 3 yrs, she can file for her U.S. citizenship.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	If she is in the untied states already (legally) no but if she is still in mexico I would recommend her getting work visa and coming first because she will not be able to without one.

This is only necessary if she moves here before you marry.<br>  After you marry you must sponsor her and she must apply for permanent resident status.

Cry all you need, its good to cry its your body's way of letting emotion out. Crying may not solve your problems or help you forget about him, but it will definitely make you feel a little better. The only solution for heartbreak is time. Time will help you heal, but until you do get over him I suggest taking his number out of your phone, maybe deleting him as a friend on facebook/myspace if you have it and prevent seeing him during school. Take a different way to class if  you know he'll be there, any way to help you get over him will help.|`|HmLhcO8Waa	it was only yesterday<br>  don't worry in about a week you'll be better and in about a month you'll probably get over him<br>  <br>  just focus on the negative things he did<br>  and how now you have the opportunity to meet a lot more guys and find someone better|`|bU9T3dmtaa	Just cry! the time will make you forget him!<br>  <br>  go to here: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnUXNIKaMuEIbjTJKUxAYQTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222182628AAjheIj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|17vLpGIBaa	Time.

AA10065812	???<br>  You don't need an attorney to file for a modification in child support, if you have grounds for a change.

Whd6tqLzaa	I know people feel like they can take revenge by cheating but its not the right thing to do. Anyway, what is done cannot be undone. Try to move on from now on. Try to be honest with your partner and not hurt him. You remember how hurt you were when he cheated on you. If you are not happy in this relationship and have thoughts for more infidelity, then I suggest you get out of this relationship to avoid hurting each other.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	It goes to show you that two wrongs never make a right. you made your bed sister now you got to pay for it.

9iEzXDqWaa	First of all,it is not right for them to do so. It's sad too hear you've been going through this for fifth-teen years,but your not alone. I've went through it all my life as well,and I'm fourty-four years old now. The only advice I can give you,is too take it to God. Believe me it really does help. Something else,you can try, find something that your good at,and work at it. This will keep it off your mind off all of the stress that they throw your way. People often do this because they have know self-esteem them shelves. Your parents were probably done that way as children,but that's know excuse. I had too get help myself,because I was doing the same thing to my son,until he told me off. That made me get the help I needed for so long. Ask your parents too let you try karate,are some sort of sport that helps build your self-esteem. Also while in high-school,when the military personnel come to visit, talk too them,this is how I learned too have more self-esteem. Good Luck And God Bless You,I Hope everything Works Out For You.|`|5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	Do you respect them when you are trying to talk or yelling.

But number one it might be the way you are trying to talk to them.Try a different way and see if that works.|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	You need to talk to a school counselor asap.

I could write about what I needed to in a secret sort of way because no one ever really knew exactly what I was talking about.  It was a way for me to tell people about my darkness without ruining my life completely.  Keep your eyes on the prize so to speak if you aren't in a position where you can talk to someone about it.  Have a goal like what you are going to do when you graduate and keep focused on that goal.  Get a hobby and spend as little time at home as you can.  Whatever you do don't listen to the abuse.  Whatever they are saying it isn't true, you are smart enough to seek out advice here.  Definitely hobby, or talk to a friend at school, you'd be surprised how many of your school friends go through the same crap with their parents.  :)|`|lVI5MfH8aa	sweetheart, you need to talk to a school teacher or guidence conselor.  my moms one and trust me they would never find out.  if you really need advice please email me at blondatheart753@aol.com or amybaby12329@yahoo.com. i can get you through it.|`|uIZg5GGHaa	STEP UP! do something crazy! drastic! hide so they think you ran away!

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there <br>  <br>  Get the information from your grandad regarding the call and go to the police or your local trading standards office and see what they advise. As for you M-i-L, just ignore what she has said, she could have got on the defensive because she realised what you said was right and that you were entitled to know about it as they were also asking about your private details. Try to get as many details as possible from you grandad and take them to some one who can advise you further. This certainly sounds a bit dodgy to me. Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: You're welcome. Hope everything works out well and it was a genuine enquiry, although why someone would ring your M-i-L to get details on you and your grandad, I have no idea. I would def look further into it though. :-)|`|KwNpyp3saa	You need to talk to your husband. It is HIS  responsibility to talk to his mom. I know that most guys won't do this. Let him know how important it is to be informed of these matters and she shouldn't be calling YOUR grandfather about it.

Be young and enjoy it, it goes fast. Those braces are going to be great for you in the long run so don't worry about those. I would do something with that cow-lick though,LOL. You are a good looking kid that I'm sure will grow up to be a very handsome young man. Now get out there and enjoy your youth. :-)|`|dyv2sqtxaa	You're 15? Wow, I would have said 12... you look really young, Maybe it's just the picture of the hair or something... but you look really young and everyone is right, you do look like the guy from toy story! :D|`|MFfoix4Aaa	VERY young.|`|U3ox0x6qaa	Your gunna be really cute when you get older but now you look really young.|`|AA10838618	Young.|`|wIRszCihaa	ehhh...grow out your hair a bit.<br>  straighten it.<br>  && take pictures from a higher angle.<br>  not so low.|`|nTn3Crneaa	young

Then, act accordingly|`|AA11461524	yes i think he likes you.|`|d07861561c1ae1f3be24fc58fcebdcf5aa	maybe he likes u
IsZ8qFRNaa	ask her these questions:<br>  <br>  are you inlove with your partner?<br>  are you financially able to support yourself if you get preggo?<br>  do you love yourself?, because u cant love anyone else if you do not love yourself<br>  does your partner love u?<br>  what will happen if i get preggo?<br>  will my friends and fam be supportive if i get preggo?<br>  <br>  sex is a complex matter and if you are not ready then it will change who you are|`|o6xLWwZvaa	She shouldn't have sex. She is too young. <br>  <br>  If you want to help her, tell her parents that your friend is thinking about having sex. Her parents need to talk to her. She needs to understand having sex is not all fun and games. She can end up having a baby. I don't think she is ready to take care of a baby. She can end up with STDS.|`|BabNC5pMaa	wow kids these days.. all they think about is to get it on lol.. but no matter wut.. don't let her ;]|`|XJlD2kPsaa	Umm, really, this is a dumb question...obviously you should tel her not to have sex.. i mean think about it shes way too underage and umm what if she goes pregnant at the age of 11?! thats not right... i mean seriosuly... im a dude and i mean i really want to well have sex but like seriously i dont think i would at this time cause im like 13... jeez... but i swear if she has sex tell her at least do it with a condom or better yet dont do it at all..|`|YXgVGjHlaa	How sad!  You definitely need to tell her not to have sex at eleven.  Tell her not to trash her life so early.|`|ksoMldqYaa	You should tell her parents so they can lock her in her room, that's what you should do.|`|q2H9jgDSaa	why are you even debating this!?<br>  tell her hell no.<br>  shes 11.<br>  she probably doesn't even know how to have sex.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	OMG she is soooo young!!!  Tell her to wait a few years- she's got plenty of time to have sex.  Besides, who's trying to coerce an 11 year old into having sex?!  This sounds mean, but I would tell her parents- she truely needs some protection from herself.|`|sVg4Qco0aa	No. Eleven is to young to be having sex. Honestly, to be that young and be interested in sex, she should go to a counselor, something is wrong.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	She's 11. She should not be having sex when she's 11. <br>  <br>  Tell her to wait.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	hell no, shes only 11, shell be a whoer her whole life if she does this now.|`|B1iBGRzUaa	You need to tell her absolutely not!!! Are you crazy? How old are u? Do you think sex is a joke???|`|7TUMfYpeaa	NO!|`|mtgrfJvSaa	hell NO|`|noqL1OSgaa	No.<br>  She is 11.<br>  The risks involed, condom or not are way too high. and there is a huge emotional attachement to the person you first sleep with, esp. that young because it is an intimate act, not to mention the STD's and possible pregancy..<br>  Oh and that whoever she sleeps with; could be charged with stautory rape, or rape of a minor (depending on what country your in) here the legal age of consent is 16..or she could, dependin on the age of the person she slept with. If hes over the legal age of consent.. He could be in trouble. If she did have sex, and either of the parents found out... and pressed charges, it could get nasty.<br>  So really... tell her no. and to wait.|`|FDIEb624aa	No not at all, they are not mentally mature enough to handle the responsibility that comes with having sex and i'm pretty sure it's illegal at 11. Tell them that it's leading them down the wrong path and that it can cause them major damage on the inside, and will damage their reputation.|`|unxgla59aa	Tell her that it isn't really right for her to have sex at such a young age. many people are curious, and she probably doesnt know all the details about it. tell her all you know, like what will happen to her body, how she will feel emotionally etc. and try to convince her to wait untill the time is right (I believe in sex after marriage but thats just me). then it will give her a lot to think about|`|l3kI29ywaa	Obviously not. You have heard about the 13 year old boy from England? And you're friend is only 11...think of what could happen. No offense but I think that's just a ridiculous age.|`|uIZg5GGHaa	Tell her, she should wait and later when she does in maybe four years to use a condom|`|rFUez4O0aa	Look at what all of this mainstream crap has done to our youth. 11? I didn't know squat about sex when I was 11, and I'm just almost 16.|`|apSTH4TIaa	No way...She is too young.  Sex isn't any good when you are 11 so please wait until you are ready.|`|EuiWiIaDaa	NO! She has NO idea what sex is about! She'll regret it...condom or not.|`|4ATRIWryaa	Why are you even asking? The answer is so obvious. NO!!!!!!!|`|7cbIlyMeaa	advice her not to do it until 18.|`|OEOCwVAmaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|KhIrprpXaa	dear lord no i'm 11 and i am not gonna have sex any time soon that's just wrong i think
cm7dLGQPaa	Umm, how old are you and is this marriage thing you  are talking about  something imminent or what?  Give me  more  info so I can try to answer..I don't quite understand totally what you are needing answewred.
