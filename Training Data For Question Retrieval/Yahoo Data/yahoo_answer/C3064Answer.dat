Either a friend could do that for you or you'd have to hire a process server, and whomever served him would have to sign an affidavit of service.  Sometimes getting people like this served is really difficult.<br>  <br>  Check with the Craig's List rules to see if/how you can report abuse or if they have any suggestions.  <br>  <br>  And from now on I'd ask for money orders or use pay pal.

Physically go to the office, if they are genuine you will see that with your own eyes, scammers rarely have genuine offices.<br>  <br>  As a further check contact the Law Society, all solicitors have to be a registered member of the Law Society. If they are registered then it sounds like you are on a winner. <br>  <br>  Step cautiously and you can protect yourself without losing out on what may be a genuine inheritance.

There are hundreds if not thousands of legitimate ways to make money online.   U<br>  <br>  nfortunately, there are also many 'grey' area type opportunities and outright fraudulent 'schemes'.  For ex., I took a quick look at this Maverick money makers program.  (I did NOT join.  I am NOT affiliate, nor will I become one. In my opinion it is BS - I am just using it as an example).<br>  <br>  While I can't say I see anything to attract me (other than the unsupported allegations that I can make a lot of money if only I pay them a lot of money to learn their secrets (I'd be willing to bet their 'secrets' are freely available on the internet if you are willing to do a little research.)  I can't say it's a scam either.  <br>  <br>  Here are a couple of things for you to consider:  Realize that no matter what 'opportunity' you decide to join; You are going to have to generate traffic to your website(s).  You can do that online by PPC, article marketing, social networking, etc or offline by press releases, running ads in papers, word-of-mouth, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you can't or won't do those things (or learn how if you don't know how) then don't bother with any type of online marketing, affiliate marketing, multi-level marketing etc.  Below I am going to provide three links to some programs I like and why you might like them too:<br>  <br>  In order from top to bottom:<br>  <br>  1) I like it because I needed some hosting services for my online business anyway, so why not get a quality hosting service AND a f ree search engine AND a f ree support system AND training from people who want me to succeed because that's how they suceed (of course that by itself is a common theme in online marketing).<br>  <br>  2) I like it because it is easy to become an affilate, there is no fee to join, it works with just about anything alse you can do online and it can help drive traffic by the use of fresh content on your website.  It <br>  isn't the best looking site but the digital ebooks are great.<br>  <br>  3) I like it because it has a higher element of risk along with a correspondingly higher potential return.  It is a new opportunity, with 'ground floor' type potential. It is a one time payment only - not a monthly drain on my wallet.|`|7sNQ5fIwaa	Making money online is universal which means your website is viewable worldwide.
