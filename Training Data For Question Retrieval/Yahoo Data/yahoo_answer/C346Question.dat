I know this guy through my family from years ago, we were friends until two years ago, we were both in relationships, soon after that I had a car accident and my world fell around me (I was a dancer) I gradually started to gain lost of weight, I mean 70lb (35kg)      anyway he got in touch with me again and we have been talking again, and he wants to meet, he says he loves me, and I'm this huge girl with a scar on her face, I wasn't even slim to start with, I want to meet him, But I don't think rejection will help (since I'm recovering from depression caused by the accident) I told him what happened, told him I gained weight, he said he doesn't care, he saw (My face) on the cam as well, But then again the weight is not on my face, Please tell me what to do? I told him to give me till the end of March, he agreed, But it's frustrating, I hate myself for being so fat (288lb) and it's stopping me living.      I want to see him too. please help      I'm a Capricorn

20090129040821AAMpVDr	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What's a good folder name to hide my movies in on my laptop so the school cannot find them?	Everyone does it :P I don't like computer games so none of that, just TV Shows and Movies. And yet, the school still cracks down on anything that's not 'educational.'      I need to disguise these movies in a folder. They keep on telling us that they will regularly check our laptops. I'm thinking I'll hide them in one of those folders that goes no where so you don't bother clicking it. It's like when you download a programme and you get all this extra stuff in a folder, like apps.Then you click on that and that takes you somewhere, and so on.      Dose anyone have any tips?   Thanks :]

Sorry i know this has been asked before (I've even asked this before), but with a Team Fabio victory last night (not exactly) I need to celebrate.       I was literally on the edge of my seat when they called Jeff, Fabio, and Stefan out to make the decision about elimination, when I saw Padma mouthing the J in Jeff before calling his name we were going crazy at my house (even though Jeff was my second favorite on the show- next to Fabio). Along with Hosea I thought they made the better half of the remaining 7, but Jamie seems to be making a run for it.       I am just wondering who your favorite chef is, I have been following for a few seasons and for some reason I've liked Season 5 best, the chefs are all good and seem like fun people, it's also set in NYC where I'm from so I recognize a lot of the places.

When reading questions (and answers) I get the impression that all other guys prefer small girls with tiny hands and I see that this makes  tall girls and girls with bigger hands ( and also myself) insecure sometimes. I really like girls, which are a little bit around the same size as myself (around 6') with big hands, so that I've something to hold when holding hands. And how taller the girl, how more girl I've to love...   But am I the only one who do love tall girls with big hands?

So I have just finished shadow kissed, the third book, and I cried when I started reading about Rose and Adrian. I love!!!! Adrian! He loves her so much and wants her to be okay and cares about her. He is so funny and brave and sweet, plus he talented and good-looking. Don't get me wrong, I totally love the chemistry between Rose and Demetri but now that it's like impossible for them to be together, I want her to fall madly in love with Adrian!! Tell me I'm not alone!      Also, I am sad about what's going on with Lissa and all that, plus the fact that now rose is leaving her, but he whole story and side stuff is kinda annoying. It's almost like the author doesn't know how to make her character be yet. I love that Lissa and Christian are together but I am bored with her story. And it sucks that her "Spirit" is screwing with Rose. Maybe I'm over-reacting. It just seems like she's perfect one second then depressed and crazy the next!       And lastly, if they made these into a show/movie who would you want to play who?      so share your thoughts and all that! thnx!

20090129065226AAN62j7	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Astro.com I find this site to be very accurate. How is it possible?	So i been on Astro for about 3 years now.  I had a friend introduce me and I have to say just about every time (100%) of the time my chart is right on, or my chart with another person (girls) is dead on about relationships.          This morning I woke up to an E-mail from a girl stating.  "You should get your butt down here and visit me to go for a ride in your new car joey."  Now I was so excited to hear that from this young lady!! However, here lies the problem.   She is for sure with a boy friend.        So I go on Astro to check up on my Love situations.        Here we go...      Astro.com       "A love relationship that starts during this time is apt to be electric, exciting, unstable and short. You are not looking for a steady relationship now; as a rule you desire the unusual. You may make some unconventional arrangement with your lover, such as agreeing to have other lovers. "       Does anyone think I should go visit this girl?  I am really attracted to her.  Might this be a waste of my time?  I am a Leo and she is a Capri.      Joey-

20090129053841AA7Wvwd	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Looking for metal song (ballad sort of), dated round 1998 with a female singer - popular on college radio?	This has been bugging me for years now. There is this metal song that was played on WSOU, that was semi popular in the 90s, around when Coal Chamber came out with their song "Big Truck." The song has a ballad like feel, with guitars that have a chorus effect on them with a mellow tone/feel. The lyrics are (from what I remember) -"you can be my witness" when the woman sings witness, she sings a few notes in there. There are a few artists that come to mind, but not totally positive if that is their song. Drill - Crisis, Drain STH, Kittie - some sort of female fronted band. This is around 1998. For those of you who listened to college radio (because that was the only good place you could get heavy metal back then aside from Q104.3 before going to classic rock) around the NY/NJ area you might know this. Thanks.      Also, her voice was melodic, and it got a little raspy. The guitars had a cool chorus effect on them. She had a hard rock feel to the vocals, and the guitars had reverb as well.

Well then i got over him and whatever. For the recent halloween he had a party, and i went.There was drinking there.. and we ended up holding hands then later we kissed and stuff. And the next day we kinda talked about it and i found out he did like me last year, and everything. Ever since that party we've hooked up four more times. But he trys to tell everyone and myself that he doesn't like me at all. But isn't it obvious? Like i know i could never kiss someone i didn't like once let alone four times.I know it's stupid but i really like him and i know he likes me but just wont admit it So now that i explained my life story hah, is there any songs that explain my situation?

20090129063204AAl7XTz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Have i broadened your vocabulary now or not ?	SOME OF YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS          (FOR       THE REST OF YOU IT WILL BE A LEARNING SITUATION)          A LICK AND A PROMISE                            'I'll just give this a lick and a promise,' my mother said as she quickly mopped up a spill on the floor without moving any of the furniture.                         'What is that supposed to mean,' I asked as in my young mind I envisioned someone licking the floor with his or her tongue.                            'It means that I'm in a hurry and I'm busy canning tomatoes so I am going to just give it a lick with the mop and promise to come back and do the job right later.                         'A lick and a promise' was just one of the many old phrases that our mothers, grandmothers, and others used that they probably heard from the generations before them. With the passing of time, many old phrases become obsolete or even disappear.  This is unfortunate because some of them are very appropriate and humorous. Here is a list of some of those memorable old phrases:                                              1.             A Bone to Pick    (someone who wants to discuss a disagreement)                         2.           An Axe to Grind    (Someone who has a hidden motive. This phrase is said to have originated from Benjamin Franklin       who told a story about a devious man who asked how a grinding wheel worked. He ended up walking away with his       axe sharpened free of       charge)                         3.               One bad apple spoils the whole barrel    (one corrupt person can cause all the others to go bad if you don't remove the       bad one)                         4.           At sea    (lost or not understanding something)                         5.           Bad Egg    (Someone who was not a good person)                         6.          Barking at a knot    (meaning that your efforts were as useless as a dog barking at a knot.)                        Barking up the wrong tree    (talking about something that was completely the wrong issue with the wrong person)                      8.           Bee in your bonnet    (To have an idea that won't let loose)                      9.           Been through the mill    (had a rough time of it)                      10.        Between hay and grass    (Not a child or an adult)                      11.         Blinky    (Between sweet and sour as in milk)                      12.            Calaboose    (a jail)                      13.        Catawampus    (Something that sits crooked such as a piece of furniture sitting at an angle)                      14.        Dicker    (To barter or trade)                         15.        Feather in Your Cap       (to accomplish a goal. This came from years ago in wartime when warriors might receive a feather they would put in their cap for defeating an enemy)                         16.        Hold your horses       (Be patient!)                         17.        Hoosegow    (a jail)                         18.        I reckon       (I suppose)                         19.        Jawing/Jawboning    (Talking or arguing)                         20.   Kit and caboodle       (The whole thing)                         21.        Madder than an wet hen    (really angry)                      22.   Needs taken down a notch or two    (like notches in a belt usually a young person who thinks too highly of himself and needs a lesson)                      23. No    Spring Chicken    (Not young anymore)                      24. Persnickety       (overly particular or snobbish)                      25.

Red    up    (clean the house)                      28. Scalawag       (a rascal or unprincipled person)                      29.

20090129064527AAbTEBp	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Sx and the City die-hard fans?	I'm researching ways on how women meet men...nothing shows it and teaches it better than Sx and the City. I'm not a die-hard of the series so I have not seen most of the episodes from first to the last season.      Please give me tips on episodes and seasons where any of the girls were single and how they met the men around town. I'm especially interested in Carrie (I adore her and Big). Carrie meeting men there depicts a lot of reality perfectly... sometimes she gets embarrassed and rejected... sometimes she gets praised and pined for... sometimes she's lonely... sometimes she's popular. I want to see more of acquaintance meeting moments - from conversation starters to asking of numbers to dating.      Season and episode numbers please. Thanks!

20090129064907AAO1nQB	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Who should be responsible for fixing or replacing my guitar?	My wife bought me a Cort Forrest 100 guitar on December 4th for getting my masters degree. Just last week (January 18-24) I went to put a guitar strap on and noticed that there is a crack coming off of the guitar button. Also, due to the crack, the button is loose and literally came out. My question is, should the shop replace my guitar, give me credit towards a new guitar, or just be responsible for gluing the button back it? Or, should Cort be responsible for getting me a new guitar? I spoke to them, and they said that they would replace it if the crack was due to cold weather.     I keep this guitar in a case when traveling between lessons and home, hang it on a guitar rack at home, and never leave it exposed to the elements. To the best of my knowledge, I have done nothing to cause this crack.

This has been a discussion between some of my friends and I over the years and I decided to put it to YA and see what others think. I am not against shopping, don't get me wrong, and it can be enjoyable when done within a limited time. I am the one that likes to go and get what I need and leave, however, my girlfriends (as well as family members) enjoy shopping all day. They never seem to get enough of it. They joke that I am an odd ball and I have had a friend (jokingly) tell me I am no friend of hers because of my anti-shopping feelings.   So, here it is....if you are a woman (or if you know women who do) do you like shopping and do you think it is odd if a woman does not like to shop, shop, shop?

20090129083720AAwvbkC	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What's the moral to your story?	Once when I was 18 I drank 1 beer with a friend and then we decided to go to her house to get some DVDs so on the way, she slid on some ice and hit a trash can and a cop saw it and pulled us over. He asked her if she'd drank anything and she stupidly thought 1 beer wouldn't show up on a breathalyzer so she said no, so they checked her and sure enough she had been drinking. So then he says "I would have let you go with an underage possessions charge, but since you lied I'm arresting you on a DUI." Then he asked me if I'd been drinking and I thought "Gee I don't want to make him mad" so I said yes, so he gave me an underage possessions charge and a ride home.      The next day, she calls me and says "I totally got all my charges dropped because my mom called a lawyer and the lawyer called the police and I blew below the DUI limit on the breathalyzer so they have to let me go."      Meanwhile, my charge stuck and I lost my license for  30 days and had to go to 12 AA meetings, where I started every time with "My name is Jen and I drank one beer."      The moral of this story is always lie to the cops.

Was it just coincidence that they had him as their help or was this recently filmed?

20090129072549AAOcnUh	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	This a shade on the long side but worth it for the laugh   ENJOY?	WAL-MART INTERVIEW    A manager at Wal-Mart had the task of hiring someone to fill a job opening. After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified. He decided to call the four in and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the  job.    The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table, the interviewer asked, "What is the fastest thing you know of?"    Acknowledging the first man on his right, the man replied, "A THOUGHT." It just pops into your head. There's no warning.    "That's very good!" replied the  interviewer. "And, now you sir?", he asked the second man    "Hmmm...let me  see "A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened.  A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of."    "Excellent!" said the interviewer. "The blink of an eye, that's a very popular cliché for speed." He then turned to the third man, who was contemplating his reply.         "Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the  house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that  switch, way out across the pasture the light on the barn comes on in less than an instant. "Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest  thing I can think of"    The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. "It's hard to  beat the speed of light," he said.    Turning to BUBBA, the fourth and final man, the interviewer posed the same question.    Old  Bubba replied, "After hearing the previous three Answers, it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA."    "WHAT!?" said the interviewer, stunned by the response.    "Oh sure", said BUBBA. "You see, the other day I wasn't feeling so good, and I ran for the bathroom, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE  LIGHT, I had already **** my pants."    BUBBA is now the new greeter at a Wal-Mart near you!
20090129074430AAtrmmN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Putting your affairs in order ?	The woman was shocked, but managed to compose herself and walk into the  Waiting room where her daughter had been waiting. 'Well daughter, we  women  celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things don't go so  well.  In this case, things aren't well.  I have cancer. Let's head to  the  club and have a martini.'    After 3 or 4 martinis, the two were feeling a little less somber. There  were  some laughs and more martinis.  They were eventually approached by some  of  the woman's old friends, who were curious as to what the two were  celebrating. The woman told her friends they were drinking to her  impending  end.  'I've been diagnosed with AIDS.'  The friends were aghast, gave  the  woman their condolences and beat a hasty retreat.    After the friends left, the woman's daughter leaned over and whispered,  'Momma, I thought you said you were dying of cancer, and you  just told your Friends you were dying of AIDS!   Why did you do that??'    'Because I don't want any of those bitches sleeping with your father  after  I'm gone.'    THAT, my friends, is what's called, 'Putting Your Affairs In Order.'

She agrees and goes with him to I believe a romance writers convention.   That's all I can remember.   The main girl had dark hair.

It was about how so many companies are feeling the affects of the economy, except Wal-mart. So, I have had this movie in my Netflix queue for a while and decided to watch, Wal-mart: The high cost of low price. I was appalled, about their treatment of their employees, especially overseas. Their greediness made me sick. My town is really small and pretty much all we have is a Wal-mart so I have no choice but to shop there. If had a choice, I would never shop there  again. I wondered what other people thought after watching this documentary.

I'm a Libra Sun/Cancer Moon/Cap Rising/Libra Mercury/Gemini Mars      The problem is that I cannot just do one type of thing, I usually have to try everything at once and I usually just get frustrated and quit everything without finishing.  Then there are times that I get so involved in something that I have to finish it from start to finish at one time.  Sometimes I get bored with something really easily and seems I'm always looking for something fulfilling, like I can't find the perfect thing.

20090129080205AAlR7WQ	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I Need Help Understanding This Cancer Guy?	I have been talking to this guy for a couple months. Last night was the first time that he made a move and kissed me. I asked him why he took so long to make a move and he told me that he didn't want to offend me because of the type of girl I am. He wanted to sleep with me but I told him no because he's told me before that he is not looking for a relationship. The thing is, he says one thing but acts another way. He HAS to talk to me every night. He told me that he looks forward to talking to me when he's at work. He told me the other day that he cares about me and he says that I am different from other girls that he has known. He has also asked me questions about what my past boyfriends were like. I'm just confused because he is saying one thing but acting another way. He told me that I should just treat him as an object if we sleep together because other girls have done that to him. He also said that he doesn't think that I would like him because he is not doing so good financially right now (he lost his job last month and just found a new one) but I told him that I don't care about that stuff. I need some help understanding this Cancer guy!

When I was a child (80's) my favorite movie was a type of crazy adventure movie but I forgot what it is called. please help as these details are a little fuzzy. First it had a guy that ran really fast and it was a mix of characters that had other abilities. It was set back in old Europe (1700's ?) and these people traveled on a ship to different places. At one point they end up on the moon with the moon man and his wife. I know that this is vague but that is all I can remember. The movie is probably from the 70's era. It was a kind of crazy monty python type movie. Any help is appreciated.

20090129082137AA7WugJ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Should Lynyrd Skynyrd continue after the death of Billy Powell?	Larkin Collins ( father of Allen Collins), Judy Van Zant Jenness (widow of Ronnie Van Zant) and Gary Rossington ( sole survivor of the original line up) have control over the Skynyrd name. An agreement was maid after the band reformed that there should be 3 original members in the band for the band to continue. After the death of bassist Leon Wilkeson, the number was lowered to 2. Larkin Collins said that it is possible that could be lowered to 1 if Gary Rossington  should want to continue.       What about you? Should Skynyrd carry on?       http://www.jacksonville.com/news/metro/2...

20090129073056AAhOR82	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Has anyone else seen Tropic Thunder? Was it just me or......?	I was really hyped up about Tropic Thunder, I didn't get to the cinema to see it. But was eagerly awaiting it's release on DVD.I rented It from the library which is a cheaper option. Only drawback is that there are only about 3 copies available so 1st time I went down it wasn't available. But I rented The Mist instead which let me tell you is a cracking film. If you want to see a good horror/thriller film watch that. Anyway last night watched Tropic Thunder and thought it was a bit of an anti climax, I know for a fact that I would have loved it had I been stoned. But sadly I wasn't nor have I been for a good few months due to moving to a new town and not knowing anyone,which has it good and bad points. Anyway Tropic Thunder what did you think?

From what I hear (And I own their Discography) Genesis is made of awesome and win right up through the Album "Genesis" and that makes six fantastic Collins Era studio albums, which perfectly matches the six Gabriel era studio albums.       Genesis from Collins Era wrote amazing songs with killer Drumming, great lyrics and excellent Keyboards, what more Ya'll want?      I can understand not liking their last three albums which are pretty much junk but it's the hate for the six before that I don't get. What's the deal?

20090129082425AAVw4qx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Got a favorite live show? (Free to Download Show of the week)?	This is week 7 of the Wire and String show of the week, if you missed the first few, there are links on my profile. I am going to try to post one free to download show a week, ideally from a different band every week. I am going to aim for Thursdays. I hope to include various genres and try to get shows of good sound quality (but might make the occasional exception for a classic show).      This weeks show:   The Breakfast- April 30th, 2004       http://www.archive.org/details/breakfast...       They are funk jazz band. The show was picked by Teaim, one of the more knowledgeable contributors to the Jazz section. I went with his pick partly to encourage anyone who has been following the "show of the week" to send me their picks for great shows and partly because I am in the process of moving and haven't turned my internet on at home yet. Some neighbor a block down's wireless connection is serving me ok for checking my email, but it isn't consistent enough for streaming music.      MQ: Do you have any shows from the archive or other show trading sites that are favorites? Post 1 or 2 you recommend.      MQ2: How do you like the show?

20081022080144AAY2SDa	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	5 minute management course LOL?	Lesson 1:       A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower, when the doorbell rings.       The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs.       When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbor.      Before she says a word, Bob says, 'I'll give you $800 to drop that towel.'       After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves.       The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.       When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, 'Who was that?'       'It was Bob the next door neighbor,' she replies.       'Great,' the husband says, 'did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?'          Moral of the story:       If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders, in time you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.          Lesson 2:       A priest offered a Nun a lift.       She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg.       The priest nearly had an accident.       After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg.       The nun said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?'       The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again.    The nun once again said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?'       The priest apologized 'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.'       Arriving at the convent, the nun sighed heavily and went on her way.       On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, 'Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.'       Moral of the story:    If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.             Lesson 3:       A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp.       They rub it and a Genie comes out.    The Genie says, 'I'll give each of you just one wish.'    'Me first! Me first!' says the admin clerk 'I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.'    Puff! She's gone.       'Me next! Me next!' says the sales rep. 'I want to be in Hawaii , relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.'       Puff! He's gone.       'OK, you're up,' the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, 'I want those two back in the office after lunch'       Moral of the story:     Always let your boss have the first say.       Lesson 4    An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.       A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, 'Can I also sit like you and do nothing?'    The eagle answered: 'Sure, why not.'       So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.       Moral of the story:    To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.         Lesson 5       A turkey was chatting with a bull.       'I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree' sighed the turkey, 'but I haven't got the energy.'    'Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?' replied the bull. They're packed with nutrients.'       The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.    The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.       Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.       He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.       Moral of the story:    Bull **** might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.            Lesson 6       A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field.       While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.       As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was.       The dung was actually thawing him out!       He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.       Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.       Morals of the story:    (1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.       (2) Not everyone who gets you out of **** is your friend.       (3) And when you're in deep ****, it's best to keep your mouth shut!          THUS ENDS THE FIVE MINUTE MANAGEMENT COURSE!!

20090129082258AAcUFwO	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you guys think?	OK. I moved out of my parents house in june of '08... I moved in with a "family friend" and I have been living with her since PAYING RENT... Well tax time comes up and she offers to claim me because my parents already have 2 children and I am moving out of her home tommorow. She only got 990 back last year for taxes and she claimed me this year and got 6600. I was just curious as to how much of a percentage would be "fair" for her to keep... Because she said i made only a 2200 difference, but I am only getting 1000 back. I don't think that is very fair but I was just curious... I was thinking a 30% share at the most, even the tax lady (her grandmother) said she was splurging a little bit.

NO other actress will be able to do that.  I believe that actors are born to play the part of certain character roles, and that is hers.

20081022080044AAKXxcL	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Light jokery for today?	I urgently needed a few days off work, but I knew the Boss would not allow me to take any leave.      I thought that maybe if I acted 'CRAZY' then he would tell me to take a few days off.      So I hung upside down from the ceiling and made funny noises.        My coworker (who's blonde) asked me what I was doing? I told her that I was pretending to be a light bulb so that the Boss would think I was 'CRAZY' and give me a few days off. A few minutes later the Boss came into the office and asked , 'What are you doing ?' I told him I was a light bulb. He said , 'You are clearly stressed out. Go home and recuperate for a couple of days.' I jumped down and walked out of the office . When my coworker (the blonde) followed me, the Boss said to her, 'And where do you think you're going?'                              (You're gonna love this..... )                                                      She said, 'I'm going home too, I can't work in the dark .'

20090129082928AAUOq2D	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Need to know the name for a rather odd movie?	I only remember seeing this movie when I was a kid, probably 10 or 12 years ago. All I remember is the guy in the movie seems very suave and sophisticated, but beard grows ridiculously fast (like, several feet in a day or so), and he's traveling on a plane when he suddenly remembers the last time he shaved he left his razor. This seems to worry him quite a bit, then there's a scene where he's homeless, in tattered clothing, washing some guy's car windshield with his beard, and apparently the guy gets pissed off and drives away.      Weird movie. Anyone know what I'm talking about? That's about all I remember, but if anyone knows what it is, help!
