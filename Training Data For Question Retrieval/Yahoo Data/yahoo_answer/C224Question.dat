Bueno el caso es que como ese dia ni el ni yo disfrutamos pues lo hicimos tambien el domingo como a las 7 pm , primero unos 5 min sin condon y ya despues se lo puso, este dia no hubo problemas con el condon , pero por si si o por si no me tome la pildora del dia siguiente el lunes como a las 4 pm   cabe resaltar que mi regla me viene los dias 4 y que el mes pasado d diciembre tambien tome la pildora y como a las 12 horas me empezo a salir un liquido cafe y ya al siguiente dia tuve mi regla ...    Porque ahora que la vuelvo a tomar no paso igual? Estar embarazada?   si funcionara la pildora al haberla tmado 35 hrs despues?

20090225145824AAclW97	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I be suspicious of my son's girlfriend or am I just being far too overprotective?	First off, let me say that my son's girlfriend(Joy) is a lovely woman and we bonded quite quickly. I really like her even though she's 36 and my son is only 25. He's legal, so why fret about it? That makes my son(Raheem) very happy because he really loves this woman and as my youngest son, he's a big "mama's boy".        Raheem and Joy fell in love quite quickly. They have been dating since November of 2008 and they have been cohabiting since January 2009. They also plan on having a baby, this will be Raheem's first, but Joy already has 20-year old son and a 10 year old son.        Anyway, I took the time recently to ask Joy what made her fall in love with my son. Aside from saying he's sweet and caring and all of the above. She told me that she knew Raheem since September of 2008, although they've only been dating since November 2008. She was actually dating another man at the time and my son persistently tried to pursue her. But she was already taken and she was not comfortable with his age. Then one day out of the blue, Raheem told me that Joy dumped that jerk she was dating who had the nerve to play her like a fool when she wound up pregnant. Raheem stuck by her side and vowed to raise the baby as his own if she gives him a chance. But ultimately, she decided to abort the child. Anyway, she greatly appreciated Raheem for being there for her so she decided to give him a chance. Finally, when January came, Raheem moved in and he and Joy talked about starting a family together and they were in love.        This all seemed so sudden. I like Joy. But should I be suspicious. How do you go from not wanting to date a guy because of his age to wanting to have his child in such a short time span. Joy claimed that Raheem just won her over big time, but it just doesn't sound right. Again, should I be suspicious?

20090225150319AAZV1hb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to deal with aggressive behaviour 22 month old?	A little about my child---   -very bright child   -early talker (3-4 word sentences at 17 months old)   -at 22 months knows alphabets, phonics, numbers to 30, very good vocabulary (she picked up tons of stuff from grandparents who are really awesome), she also can remember names of people even those who she has briefly met,    -very affectionate loves to hug and kiss   -She is a very friendly child but she will not stay with strangers, she did have high separation anxiety as a baby.      Recently grandparents visited and she got very attached to them. They live in another country and so she cannot see them but she talks to them online daily. They left beginning of feb and when a friend visited few days later she pulled on her T shirt. I took her to another room and told her that she was in a time out, she did it again on another day to another friend. I've talked to her abt it and she says that pulling is not ok, she also said sorry to her friends, but she still does it. I am a stay at home mom and I need some advice. I also stopped breastfeeding in January. How can I help her deal with her grandparent not being there or do you think there might be some other explanation for this behavior.

20081007184522AAIXxdX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question for parents about dating?	Ok so I started "seeing" a guy. We aren't really "dating" yet. He's really nice, he's a Christian and he already said he doesn't want to do anything. I met him at a Christian concert on Friday. He's my best friend and my best guy friend's friend. They both tell me he's a pretty good kid. He's sweet, and sensitive too.      But here's the problem. I don't know how to tell my parents. I'm almost 16 (November 2) and I haven't ever really "dated a guy" before. I don't know how to tell them. We haven't ever really talked about me dating so I don' know if they'll approve of it or not.      So here's my question. Using the information above what would be the best way to tell them about it? I don't want to sound slutty and I don't want them to think of it as a huge thing because I'm not officially dating" the guy yet.       Anyone got any advice???
20090129001618AA0eaLT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Can this really happen?	**DISCLAMER**   *Legally, under the US of Me, you can't get offended by anything said.*      There was a man named Smithers John Jacob The IV      He ran a traveling sales man, but he never sold anything. He only got the people he talked to to sell their soul to him and his accomplice Raul St.JimJohn. Together they traveled the world collecting people souls till one fateful day.    A warrior Amber McChesterfield Spankypants, has trained her whole life taking down evil traveling sales men who stole peoples souls. She was a black belt in martial arts and could make chuck norris cry real tears of fear. She had been tracking the evil salesman and his accomplice since the mere age of 12. It was her life's mission to take him down. She followed him near and far and low and high and back and forth. She followed him to the depths of the earth and to the highest mountains.    She met some interesting people along the way. One of the people was Tim the half-man half-moutain goat. He was her loyal half-human GPS device, see, tim knew how to get everywhere in the world using only his sense of smell. And yes, mountain goats do fall off the face of mountains. She met many friends on her mission and they became friends and collegue in the International Fighting Brigade, that they started and founded.    Amber's next friend was a sprite, yes, they do exist. Her sprite friend Giggles McSparkly Sherlock, ensured their protection from evils such as terrorist, villians and Borat. Giggles was their magic Sherriff. Together they frolocked across the world in hopes of fianlly catching up to Smithers.    Their luck struck on April 19, 2048, when they came across him in Alabama. He was stealing the souls of the podunk. He would later use them as fossil fuel. Smithers was walking from broken front porch to broken front porch, having to climb over the hound dogs, in order to get to the mosquito eaten screen doors. The mosquitos in Alabama do more drugs than the people do. The International Fighting Brigade of Amber, Tim and Giggles covered them selves in mud, blending in with the misshapen road. They crept along and crept along and crept along till their knees hurt from being in the creeping position for so long. They plotted their master plan and the first order of businness would be to take out Raul St.JimJohn. Raul was a creepy little trollman, he was also part rabbit. The International Fighting Brigade lured Raul St.JimJohn away with swamp weed covered carrots. They trapped him in a magical cage that would turn him into to a large pound cake with strawberries, which they would eat because they were tired and needed a break. Smithers soon realized that Raul has gone missing. he searched high and low and found nothing but a wasp net he quickly regretted trying to punt.    The team left a trail of clues and by clues I mean puzzle pieces and by puzzle pieces I mean notes telling him where to go. He followed them diligently and adamantly and quickly. They led him to an enchanted ugly forest where Giggles cursed the trees to beat Smithers as he walked through. When they got through the forest, they could no longer find Smithers, they only saw a man with a face not even he could love. They were so frightened they fled to the nearest town and had a pint of guiness and played darts.          Smithers died months later of from rabies he contracted from Raul.         Yes, I really did just type whatever came to mind. The entire story was improv'd and I went back and changed nothing but typos. Its hard to type when laughing so hard you cry.    But yes, this is the product of typing what comes to mind while trying to stick to a story setting.    And all names are completely orginal and though up by me.      Tell me what you think.   Yes, I know this is completely ridicoulous, I am quite aware of that. Its suppose to be.
20090129001556AAcqIjg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I get my 9 year old daughter to do something with her hair?	My 9 year old daughter insists on having her hair long. That is fine by me because I also had long hair growing up.   The thing is that she will only wash, condition, and brush it. I'm not into fashion by any means, but her hair is in her face and looks unkempt.  I've tried to encourage her to let me put it in a ponytail, a braid, or even a headband. She doesn't like it though and ends up taking it out.   She says it feels uncomfortable and she likes her hair to be free.   Should I just let her run around with wild (yet clean) hair or keep trying to make her look "presentable"?

Lol, I'm tired of drama, so I want to have a little fun. Use this thread to brag about your little ones! 10 points given at my discretion ;)      My brat(affectionately) is 21 months old, and jabbers up a storm. She knows all sorts of words. She's a big help around the house, she'll put shoes away and always take her dirty laundry to put it(and her toys) in her laundry hamper. She knows and mimics the sounds of cats, dogs, frogs, birds, cows, elephants, and duckies. She's very well behaved in public, for being almost 2, lol. She helps me out in the grocery store and carries things for me, and will actually put them on the register to be rung up without a fit. She knows we "run" after looking both ways when crossing the street. She's a bit of a rascal, and into her scooting away from mom during diaper changes, but that's her. She loves to read, and has the entire Sesame beginnings book Bubbles Bubbles memorized, and reads it to herself, and will do the motions like poke her belly three times when the bubbles pop pop pop. She doesn't get out of her bed at nighttime, and has only done so once during her nap in the 2 1/2 months since we converted her crib. She helps me clean up during bathtime, and sometimes before bed. She puts laundry in the dryer for me, and knows how to put every penny she finds into her piggy bank. She loves Elmo and choo choos, and going byes.    I'm so proud of my little one, how bout you?

Okay so me and dh were trying to get pregnant, having sex everyday, I took a pregnancy test on the day of my expected period and it was NEGATIVE. I just naturally assumed I was not pregnant, then on the 17th (3 days after I expected my period) I started what I assumed was my period. BUT it has lasted for 13 days! So I went to the ER they told me I was IN FACT pregnant but that they could not tell if I had been pregnant and was miscarring or if I was only "barely pregnant" because my level was so low. I am supposed to go back in a couple of days but what do you guys think this means?
20090128235819AA6pmQB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you deal with a child who adamantly refuses to do something you've told her to do?	Had a battle of wills with my 8 yr old. She refused to do her reading assignment. After I threatened and scolded, she finally made a horrible show mock reading and then launched into a terrible temper tantrum which got her sent to bed early. I could hear her yelling from her bedroom between hysterical sobs that she wanted to die. "kill me NOW!!" was the main theme of her wailing.      We later had a calm and rational talk about proper behavior but I can't shake the feeling of parental failure. There must be a better way to deal with that sort of resistance before it gets to the point of hysteria.       Any thoughts???

20090129005534AAbDEbH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Ok your a mother of 3 children you have a new bf who would you leave the kids with when u need a babysitter?	ok your living with your new bf and will soon have a baby with him but you need a babysitter for the day and the bf is home would you    1. take the kids to your mothers to watch?  2. let the partner watch the kids?    i ask because this is a issue that turns into a heated debate as my gf who has 3 kids to a previous relationship wants her mum to watch the kids when she needs a babysitter and this includes the children that we have.  she sees it unfair to send 3 kids and leave 1 behind.    so i feel disadvantaged that i cant have the normal first right to mind my baby because she wants her mum to watch her 3 and ours has to go aswell.
20090129001350AAStcHx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Is it just me or are more teens planing pregnacies?	I actually had a friend tell me that she was planning on getting pregnant so that her and her boyfriend could get food stamps! I am all for raiseing a baby that opps was a surprise. But planning it, and playing it off to everyone like that!!? She had a point though she said everyone she has known to get pregnant young gets a lot of help, and she could use it. I was so upset about this. My sister was pregnant at 17 and now that I think about it she did have everything handed to her. Her car, her apartment, all the babie's stuff. She's never worked a day in her life and she's 26 now with 4 kids. It really pisses me off. That I am working my *** off everyday barely paying the bills living with my boyfriend. On the pill becuase I don't need a baby on my hip as a fashion assecory thank you! When I have kids I want them for the right reasons. & I want to be able to care for them myself. They are with you for life not just 18 years! If it's an accident and the condom broke. Or you forgot a pill fine but don't plan it that's just skanky! I would be very interested to hear opinions on this.

I actually ovulated on 1/24/09 so I am hoping for the best outcome from that. My main concern is I have been having terrible back pain for one week. I am afraid if I go to the doctor they will want me to go for an MRI and I am not sure if that is safe. But it also concerns me if I do become pregnant will I have terrible pain if i don't get this under control now. Should I wait until my expected menstrual cycle and determine whether or not I'm pregnant before going to doctor for my back? I am only 23 so this back pain is a bit overwhelming at such a young age!!

20090129011157AAAYUwc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Tips on how to start solids?	Just little bit about my daughter Kylee. she is 4 months weighs 18 lb 27inchs tall. she is formula fed 5-6 oz every 3-4 hours. I just think shes ready to start on solids. Not too much but maybe once a day or every other day. I have bee spoon feeding baby cereals past 5 days. I try to give her in between feeding. of example, if i feed her bottle at 1pm and give her about 3oz of baby cereal she will get hungry around 6 o clock instead of 4 or 5.       i bought some stage 1 gerber food ( apple sauce, bananas, carrots and etc)  and gave it to her today. ( i gave her apple today) it doesnt seem like it makes her full though. she gets hungry at the same time for milk. anyways i am not even sure if i am doing everything correctly. I know shes bit young so i am very careful.       is there anything i should know about starting solids? anything important i am leaving out?

20090129013629AAAOrJT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant? (Don't worry, I'm an adult)?	I feel silly asking a, "could I be pregnant?" question, but through all the searches I've done, I haven't found an answer that fits me.      I've been stressed way out this last month and I missed a couple of my birth control pills, and I told my husband, so we used a back-up method like the pamphlet suggests, but we, ahem "love each other" quite a bit, so I'm wondering if anything in there before we started using the back up method could have stayed living and gotten me pregnant?        I have been cramping for what seems like two weeks, like I'm about to get my period, but even when I do get my period, I only start cramping the day of, so this is really weird.   Also, I have been lightly nauseous on and off which I tried to make myself believe I was making it up in my head, but I know for sure I almost puked at a basketball game we went to.  Yesterday I just couldn't get out of bed, I slept all day, which isn't terribly unheard of for me, but I had stuff to do yesterday but I was just SO tired.  Now my nipples have been a little sore for about 2-3 days... which I'm trying to make myself think that it's cuz my period is almost due, but that doesn't happen to me ever when I usually get it.  Also they look normal... they are not dark or anything.        I've taken two of those "know 4 days sooner" home pregnancy tests and they were both negative, but from what I'm reading, most women say they don't work any sooner.  I'm due for my period in 3 days.       My husband and I do want kids someday, we just wanted more time to ourselves before we had them, but he (this is cute girls) said that if we are pregnant, it's just like getting a present before we expected to, and everybody likes an early present, lol.        So, lol, could I be pregnant? And do those early tests work early in your experience?

My 3 month old daughter goes to bed in her crib with a sleep positioner that keeps her from rolling over. However when I go get her in the morning or now, when I have checked her in the middle of the night. The sleep positioner is at one end of the crib and she is at the other. Tonight I just found her and she had turned completely around! Is this dangerous? She hasn't tried to roll over while sleeping yet...is the sleep positioner necessary and is there really anything I can do?

20090406223618AAuK0Wr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Call the doctor!!! more of a statement..?	Many parents ask questions oh Y!A to get advice on similar experiences that other members have had with their own children. They want to know something like    My daughter had a rash but no fever and it disappears when pressed with a glass- a reply to this post was call 911!   My son has a fever 101 how do i cool him down?-again call 911      Why is every one on here so quick to say a doctor is the best fix? Most of the time childhood illnesses and coughs can be treated at home with a hug and lots of rest.      What also bothers me is the over use of Tylenol/Panadoll. It's not needed for low grade fevers or immunisations. I know it used to be recommended years ago before you got your babies needles a dose of tylenol/Panadol would be given routinely to prevent discomfort, but it's been proven that it's really unnecessary.      Sorry for the rant, I would like other peoples opinions on these issues please.

Brevemente mi caso es el siguiente, voy a ser madre proximamente pero acabo de perder mi trabajo y aparte por otras cuestiones practicamente me quedé en la calle, yo no puedo sacarlo adelante y estoy desesperada por mi horrible situación financiera, aparte que a estas alturas nadie me va a emplear...no soy la típica joven sin estudios, realmente estoy preparada pero ahorita a lo que veo eso no me sirve de nada y como nunca, me han pasado muchas cosas negativas y se me han cerrado las puertas y aunque deseo este bebé como no se imaginan, creo que sería egoísta de mi parte privarlo de muchas cosas aparte no se diga de mi situación emocional...por favor respuestas serias ya que no sé ni por donde empezar...vivo en el estado de Sinaloa...Gracias

20090128204512AAiLqXT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do a lot of people object to children with cell phones?	It seems like a lot of parents on here don't agree with kids having cell phones (like under 15)      But its a different time now, there are many reasons why I think kids NEED to have phones.      For one thing, there are so many situations that could happen where a cell phone would be needed... God forbid if your child ever got stranded somewhere or kidnapped, if you're looking at the most extreme situations. What if your kid was out somewhere and you needed to reach them for an emergency? In a perfect world you would know exactly who they were with and have those people's phone numbers but that isn't always the case, so how would you get in touch with them?      Pay phones are very scarce now a days so if your child ever needed to get in touch with you, it would hard if they didn't have a cell phone.      There is always the option of limited plans that don't allow over a certain number of minutes and you can control who your child can call if they are very young and need guidance.      I just think whenever a child gets to the age when they start going out with their friends (like 10yr-13yr depending on when parents let them) they need a phone.      Just something I noticed, im not a kid nor do I have one but I just wanted to comment on it.
20090128205841AAOMLzh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you think she is pregnant???	3 and 1/2 months ago something happened ....(very personal not sharing on here)      2weeks after that happened she bled for 2 days, light spotting, only changing the pad 1 time a day if that. She had an annoying cramping, it was mild. (not like period cramping).      A little bit after that she started having morning sickness and actually puking.Then little by little she started feeling pregnancy symptoms like: being tired all the time, wanting to sleep all the time, (morning sickness above), that butterfly feeling (not so much at lst she did not notice it til later on), being very bitchy, peeing a lot, cant quench her thirst.      1 month ago she noticed her belly getting bigger (I actually saw the 3 pics she sent me she has got a prego belly look they were taken yesterday and sent to me on the cell phone). She started getting the round ligament pains. The butterfly feeling still continued.(it would go for a little bit then kinda stopped) She was having clear, runny discharge steadily (no foul smell). She was having random cramping (not painful but annoying.)      She is craving: peanut butter, fritos bbq chips, cheese and ice cream l      When I was asking her the past couple of days she has noticed      * Her belly getting bigger   * her boobs getting heavier   *growing out of her jeans(tighter around the belly part)   *feels hard   ovbiously missed period   extreme tiredness   headaches   more frequent visits to the bathroom   *hard time consternating/clumsy   *:heartburn, indigestion, gas   *irritability, mood swings, irrationality, and weepiness   *hot on moment cold the next   *restlessness   *out of breath just from going up the stairs(she is not overweight, she is average)   *:tingling feeling in arms and legs   *saying she looks fat (saw pics just looks prego, she said she has always been flat but now a huge buldge)*belly she has gotten like that in the past month)   *belly feels to her like there is a weight on it (heaviness)      AFTER ALL THIS SHE GOT 2 NEG TESTS but did them wrong (poured the pee on the stick from the cup. and drank ALOT of water I mean a lot, to be able to pee.   So, What do you think? She is doing another test (1st response tomorrow)      *her period is due in 2 weeks about*         **OTHER THAN THE BLEEDING SHE HAD 3 DAYS.. SHE HAS NOT HAD A PERIOD SINCE.
20090128203715AAXtPM0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should I have known better?	My friends boyfriend told me he got her an engagment ring. I'm 17 and my friend and her boyfriend are 18. So a few months later, I was going through my email, and found where he told me. So I called her and told her. Now her boyfriend is mad at me because he said that he told me not to tell her, when he didn't. And my friend along with my "best friend" think I shouldn't have told, that her boyfriend DID tell me not to tell her even though he didn't. And "It's a frickin ring! My gosh." what one of them said. But I didn't know. I didn't know it would be that big of a deal. I thought my friend would be happy to know that.

20090128210222AAbTtIJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about taking Ortho Try-Cyclen Lo?	My wife takes Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo birth control pill.  Before she even started birth control she had irregular periods as it was, however on the birth control she had regular monthly periods.  She had been taking the pill for about two years (since after the birth of our son).  Towards the beginning of this year she missed three days of the medicine because we had trouble picking up the prescription.  She got the medicine and began taking it again as normal.  It has been nearly four weeks since this has occurred.  During this period (first being a few days after we got the medicine back and she started taking it) we have had intercourse a few times without a condom.  Besides the fact that the pill helps 99% of the time or whatever, could she have gotten pregnant during this time.  We were told she would have to had been off the pill for 6 weeks to 2 months before she could become pregnant, however I have heard it could happen after a few days.  We did not have sex during the days she didn't have her medicine but only the days afterwards when she started taking it again.  How long does it take for the pill to "get out of her system" and become ineffective?  I'm not sure how to word this right, so any help at all would be appreciated.  Thank you for your answers.
