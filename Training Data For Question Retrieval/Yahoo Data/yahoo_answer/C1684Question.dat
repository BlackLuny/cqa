Another one for Obama supporters:    If you found Bigfoot making Crop Circles in your backyard what would you do?    A) Bomb him, like Bush would do.    B) Open diplomatic relations, like Obama would.    C) Shoot a supporter, like Cheney would.    D) None of the above. "I will drive off that bridge when I get to it," like Kennedy would.    Score yourself 10 points for each right answer. And no looking at others' papers.

20090202225724AALFCvL	News & Events;Current Events	How should we as Americans thank Denny's for their generous deal?	In case any of you weren't watching the Super Bowl commercials, from 6AM tomorrow (Feb. 3rd) to 2PM, Denny's is giving out free Grand Slams to anyone throughout their restaurants (The only two stores not participating is the Denny's at 350 Baker Blvd. in Baker, CA, and the one at 740 Main St. in Las Cruces, NM.). No paperwork, no buying anything first, just a big platter of American Breakfast-y goodness. (They're also doing this in Canada and Puerto Rico, too.) Here's a link to prove it.       http://www.dennys.com/       In this time of worldwide economic slump, most companies wouldn't dare do something like that. Not even in times of prosperity, because it's just too expensive. And as the economy gets worse we're saving what few dollars we have left when companies need them the most. (Hence the bailouts: had we been in good shape, they would've been doing great) Aside from "Going Out Of Business" sales, we don't get very many discounts anymore. American (And the rest of the world's, too) morale has been really low, especially with the news media staying on their rants that this is the worst economic slump in history. Us as a people are hurting.      But Denny's has shown it's giant heart capacity. After all this, "OMG the economy just keeps getting worse and worse, and we're all gonna be broke", they're helping to mend our mood and restore our hope. Everyone is saying, "Wow, that's going to be over 250 million free meals. How can they afford to do that?" and slowly but surely the public will come out from underneath that big dark cloud and look at the sky and be able to say, "Hey, things aren't so bad. After all, if a chain of restaurants can afford to give away over 250 million meals normally valued at $8.50, then I can certainly afford to do a little spending myself!" And once we get back our confidence (no thanks to the media), we'll be back in prosperity in no time.       After a year of economic woes and other problems, America is finally going to get a fair deal, courtesy of Denny's.      How can we thank them for that?

I've recently read about the whole "be neutral. be sweden" thing about Alba either being a ditz or a history buff. Did O'reilly ever interview her before that or comment about her before?

Please don't comment on why YOU think he is an a$hole or a genius...i was just wondering why she would say that. (if you call someone with a talk show names, one would think that person would retaliate one way or another, especially if it's a show about his opinion of the news and not the actual news reporting)

Ora, ognuno può essere più o meno sensibili con questi soggetti, io non riesco a considerarli malati, uno che prende la polmonite è malato, uno che ha un tumore è malato, un ago nel braccio non è una malattia. Comunque, facciamo finta di nulla, consideriamoli malati di mente, ma allora rinchiudiamoli al manicomio; sinceramente se penso che i soldi miei (e vostri) che ho sudato con fatica e sacrificio, e che poi ho versato come tasse, vadano cacciati giù dal cesso a quel modo mi incazzo un attimo.
