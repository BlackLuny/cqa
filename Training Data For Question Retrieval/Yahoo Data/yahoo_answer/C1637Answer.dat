POP is closer to the parks and has better transportation. <br>  <br>  BTW...Disneyland is in California, Walt Disney World is in Orlando FL.<br>  <br>  This website has a lot of information on current specials:<br>  <a href="http://www.mousesavers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mousesavers.com/</a><br>  <br>  Please only book through an authorized Disney travel agent. I have read too many horror stories of people being told incorrect information when booking through unauthorized agents.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I wouldnt recommend the disney hotels as they are very expensive, not worth the money you do pay and you will end up spending a fortune being in the parks the whole time. When we went we stayed at the Orlando Metropolitan resort on International Drive, we paid 280 dollars for 10 nights including breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children, you can find that hotel here <a href="http://tracking.alpharooms.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=411" rel="nofollow">http://tracking.alpharooms.com/idevaffil...</a> Also I dont know what country you are flying from but we always use Delta airlines.<br>  <br>  The location of that hotel was great as we had easy access to International drive, the premium outlets and the parks, the hotel provides free transportation to the theme parks. Universal Studios is also a lot cheaper than disney, 99 dollars for a ticket for a week for both parks.|`|bo4dGu7Waa	It is spell-ed Walt Disney World. Disneyland is in California.<br>  <br>  You have two children and you are going to Disney. The best Hotel for a family, and if you want a really cheap hotel. Stay at Pop Century Resort.<br>  It is about $82 per night and it is a Disney Hotel. It is worth it. There are many extras that will entertain your children.|`|LWQMPW2Xaa	if you are going to disney then here are some helpful saving tipss. <br>  <br>  1. stay on the grounds. if you stay on the grounds you can stay at a value resort($82 a night) and its the same price as a hotel off grounds. also if you stay on the grounds you can get the meal plan. and free transportation. theres also moderate($149 a night) and deluxe($240 a night). <br>  <br>  2. Get the meal plan. this saves you so much money. you only can get this plan if you stay on the grounds. the meal plan is 40 dollers per person per day but this is a money saver with out a doubt. because with this you get a sit down, a snack, and a over the counter. The sit down will usually cost you about $250 for a family of four and an over the counter about $150 for a family of 4 thats if you dont get the meal plan. <br>  <br>  3.if you stay on grounds you also get extra magic hours this means you can stay later and go early then other people and you can get on more ridesss. cause theres usually no line. (:<br>  <br>  4. transportation is amazing there. the buses come about every 20 minutes usually every 10 minutes and they are labeled to where they are going and they take you there. they run all day. and there comfortableee. <br>  <br>  hopeee i helpped. <br>  <br>  also, heres a website if you want more information on everything <br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts-compare/" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts...</a>|`|URZNtrxsaa	Good Morning,<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend going to the Disney website and booking your travel with them. Disney has a wide variety of hotels in all price ranges for you and the kids to stay at within the Magic Kingdom. When our three children were young and money was tight, we still found great bargains on the property. The benefit is that you can utilize the Disney bus system to go everywhere without paying. No having to track down your car and driving back and forth from the property to your hotel. And, buy the multi day park hopper passes, as it gives you access to the two water parks (all the hotels on property alsohave huge swimming pools or beaches). Although your children are young, if you are going in July, you will need to get into the water to cool off (and they do have beach access for children of all ages). BTW, you can also purchase discount tickets with your hotel stay and with times being tight, even Mickey is offering discounted packages.  So, try going to Disneyworld.com and have a magical vacation!!|`|sF13O9Fmaa	We go every year from the UK and always to a villa.<br>  I recommend www.orlandovillas-florida.com but they might allready be booked up for this July, we are going in june for 3 weeks.<br>  If you do rent a villa you have much more room and your own pool and jacuzzi. I love the fact that you just open the door and your own private pool is just there. Also if you stay on site at Disney world you can still be quite far away from the parks unless you go to one of the more expensive ones.|`|NMTVIJrYaa	Just depends on your budget. I have been 7 times and always rented a house in the kissimmee area. Im now taking my son for the first time and renting a house. It is best value, plus with 2 small children your have own pool. I booked through virgin holidays and asked for the discount if booked then and there, And got great deal plus there by fare the best to fly with.|`|bP6tE3anaa	the best place for you to stay if you can afford it is so actually stay in the disney parks hotels. your kids would love that.|`|1IsKyXdgaa	its disney world, and if you want to save money stay at all-star or pop century, every hotel is pretty much kid-friendly.
Hkq1eBSiaa	heya i live pretty near thorpe park.<br>  im thinking this would be cheapest for you.<br>  get an all day travel card which is ￡2 for under 16s and get a train down to kingston.<br>  then walk to cromwell bus station which is really close<br>  and get the 218 to staines i think it is. that bus will cost aroound 60p to get on<br>  then get off at staines bus station, and catch the thorpe park express which is ￡2 to the park itself.<br>  hope i helped!

Now ask yourself if she's worth that.|`|6TNanQsxaa	wow. this question makes me happy. i'm not sure why, but it makes me happy. i'm pretty sure that it's illegal to have sex on an airplane. i mean, if you can get away with it then good for you, but i'm thinking that they would most likely notice if two people of the opposite gender went into an airplane bathroom together. here's a better idea. why don't you get her phone number and possibly go on a DATE or just talk to her a little bit before you try to get in her pants. and it's not like there aren't a million other places to have sex besides the bathroom on a plane.....|`|4hzPCxmyaa	It's illegal. There have been people who have been given large fines and banned from flying with certain airlines. There was a magazine article awhile ago about two people that had sex in the bathroom and got caught. A small plane of officials somehow took them off the plane during the flight. I can't remember if it was the police or some kind of sky patrol. I have no idea how they managed to take them off of the plane and put them in another while still in the air. I can't remember what article it was, but it was an article written by a flight attendant about the crazy stuff that went on during her job.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Oy.......there is not enough room for two people to be in the lav at the same time.<br>  <br>  And oh - F/A's know when two people have that look in their eyes.

GT5Oo186aa	Yes, we stayed at the Contemporary, and we did exactly as you are wanting to do.<br>  But tell the front desk as a matter of courtesy.|`|1IsKyXdgaa	yeah.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Yes. You can also store you luggage with checkout if you don't want to load up your car before heading to the parks.|`|B6ioLtejaa	Yes. You can do that.
keGOvavbaa	Virgin Atlantic only allows upgrades from certain fare classes -- the vouchers you've used would need to book into those classes in order for you to use miles to upgrade.  (Most airlines, however, book free ticket vouchers into restricted buckets that wouldn't earn miles, so it's unlikely that this would be any different.)<br>  <br>  If, in the unlikely event that they will book you into one of these upgradeable fares, you'd need to call them no later than the day before the flight to get the upgrade, as is clearly noted on their website.|`|eevhC1Ivaa	yes

pS4e5OtZaa	$1200 is probably right. It depends on when you go (season), what days you travel (travel over a weekend), when you book (booking just before you leave is often expensive). Also, some airports don't have a lot of capacity (few flights). They are generally more expensive. It may be cheaper to fly into Rome or Milan and take the train to Ravenna.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	The price is more than fair. Remind you, it's "high summer season" in Italy ! I am paying more or less the same, with Eurofly (in US dollars) for my trip at the end of June !!|`|URZNtrxsaa	That sounds like a good price!! I was in Italy for the Christmas holidays with my family in Sicily and came back before New Years day paying US $1275.00 RT from Phoenix thru Rome to Palermo.
3BGfiCGjaa	You could ask them what DVDs they like, but if you can't, then I'd go for comedies. They're usually suitable for both gender's in that age.<br>  <br>  Do they like dried fruit? If so, that's a healthy snack. Also more "special" fruit than the normal apples etc. can be well appreciated by children. Melon, plums, grapes ... but fruit makes quite a mess, though. And, yes, nuts! Yummy nuts are always good (if they're not allergic or anything). All sorts are good. A special one my children love is honey nuts. Not just dry nuts, but with honey "icing". <br>  <br>  Remember to have music! And, one more idea. audio-books. They can listen to them for several hours if they're interesting. Do they like Harry Potter? Lord of the Rings? Nancy Drew (I doubt it, but they are hilarious on audio-book)? One really great "audio-book" is "War of the Worlds" It has a lot of great music and a story about alien invasion!|`|36a3ynpJaa	For that age they can spend some time doing the alphabet game along the road.  So they can see and A in McDonAlds, a B in Burger king and so on.  They each try to get all the way through the alphabet.   Q is hard but Z is easy because of Pizza.<br>  <br>  Be sure to take a few breaks before they get tired.|`|04Te5gzzaa	Nintendo DS or Gameboy for both.  <br>  <br>  Cell phones so your 14 yr old can talk & text to her friends.<br>  <br>  Any animated movie like Madagascar, Wall-E, The Incredibles, Shrek, etc....none of the Disney stuff.  I think the 14 year old would be bored of those.  Maybe some teen movies too would be fun for both to watch...like The Chronicles of Narnia or Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, something similar.<br>  <br>  Nuts and fruits would be healthy snacks.  Keep them in baggies so they won't be a mess to distribute and each can have their own bag.  <br>  <br>  Bring a pillow/blanket for each if you expect them to nap in the car comfortably.<br>  <br>  That's all I could think of.  Don't forget your GPS if it's not already on-board.|`|KaCt5j62aa	you're in luck, i'm a fourteen year old girl and my brother is a twelve year old boy, so i think i can help.

d7908def95c72a79cbe9300435adf2d2aa	Hi, I have been to Florida several times and I am very fair skinned (red hair and blue eyes ) and was worried like you about burning anyhow someone recommended that I buy P20 (you can get it slightly cheaper at the Airport in duty free) it is fantastic you only apply it once a day and that protects you all day even in the really hot weather I managed to be out all day in the sun and didn't burn once. Like I said it is a bit expensive but totally worth it.. <br>  Little tip If you are going to discovery cove don't use it on that day as they supply the cream for you as it has to be a certain kind because of the dolphins and fish<br>  Hope that helps and have a fantastic time|`|AA10855383	Just wear sunblock. U will still get a tan with sunblock on, but u wont get sunburnt. And the UV index isnt that high its like 6.. i would wear spf 30... tan during hours where the temps are at their highest like.. well right now between 11 and 4|`|pCOxHjqgaa	Well I went on a cruise in Jan. and left from Orlando and went to the Caribbean. Now I tan easy and don't get burnt easy (My face and shoulders might get red but it goes away and doesn't hurt.) If you don't burn easy like me put sunscreen on the areas where you get red (for me it's my face and shoulders.) If you burn easy then put sunscreen on EVERYWHERE. You can use any kind of sunscreen but use SPF 50 because you can go a while without putting it on again and protects you better. Also you WILL get tan with sunscreen. I luvv to swim so I get tan without even trying. It's weird in gym because my legs and arms are really tan. It just depends on your skin type. Also if your skins sensitive get sunscreen for sensitive skin. Also get sunscreen made for your face because mine got bumpy from regular (IDK y??). Don't stay out too long!! Have fun. I kno u will!! Florida's awesome!!|`|dHr7Ks4eaa	think you are panicking for no good reason.

Just wear at least a 8 level sunscreen, apply it regularly, and you will be just fine.|`|1IsKyXdgaa	depending on your skin.. but if you use sunscreen use one that's got a lower spf..|`|Bu2RK7i2aa	it depends on a lot of things whether or not you can get a good tan depending on where you go in the world and what the atmosphere is like.<br>  the time of year you are going is a factor too and your skin type. if you are pale you should avoid low factors because you will tan just as easy with a high factor.<br>  <br>  id say stick with around factor 8 or 10 at first untill you have a satisfactory tan then continue with a lower factor.<br>  i have quite tanned skin in general so i start with an 8 or a 6 and after a week or two of proper sunbathing i move down to a 4, sometimes a 2. which i dont recommend considering all the fuss over skin cancer.<br>  3 or 4 hours of lounging around in the sun by a pool while alternating laying on your back and front with frequent dips in the pool should give you a lovely tan if you are prone to it,but if your pale you may just end up burning. you have to know you own body.<br>  <br>  it also depends on what activities you are doing. if your going to florida to lay in the sun everyday then higher factors are best obviously. but if you are going for the theme parks and shopping and wont be fully exposed to the sun for long periods of time then its not much point bothering with high factors.<br>  <br>  sorry to go on but there are loads of options, just work out whats best for you skin and dont burn! it ruins a holiday :)

pcHp7Dgkaa	The "Tomorrow" series is really very good and I think you might enjoy them. They're really Young Adult  books but are very well written and plotted and I read and enjoyed them when my (then) teenagers were reading them. Just try the first one "Tomorrow When the War Began" first and see what you think.<br>  <br>  Other good Australian authors are David Malouf (I love "Johnno"), Tim Winton, Nick Earls ("Zig Zag Street" is very funny), Helen Garner, Kate Grenville, Elizabeth Jolley, Christopher Koch, Geraldine Brooks and Christina Stead. <br>  We also have Peter Carey who is much awarded though I don't particularly like his stuff, Colleen McCulloch, Bryce Courtenay, Morris West. Patrick White and of course, Tom Kenneally ("Schindler's Ark").<br>  <br>  We also have a swag of very good fantasy writers including Trudi Canavan, Glenda Larke, Jennifer Fallon, Fiona McIntosh and Kate Forsyth.|`|cTYhnumDaa	Garth Nix is a great author who writes fiction books.<br>  He was born in Melbourne, Australia<br>  <br>  I love Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen which is a triology written by him<br>  <br>  and also the keys to the kingdom series which consists of Mr Monday, Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday and Superior Saterday.

I'll try and remember the names and writers....  <br>  Matthew Reilley is an Australian writer... but writes Hollywood blockbuster action books that no Hollywood studio could ever afford to produce.. great reads though.  <br>  "He Died with a Felafel in his Hand" - John Birmingham is another famous book about shared living in Australia.<br>  Puberty Blues - Kathy Lette is about the teenage surfing culture in the 70s.<br>  That's all I can think of at the moment.....

89ff4d66abc41fa64f9e0ff2d5b6ffd4aa	I'm a nationalist & have no problems with the Welsh.  I'd rather have Welsh & Irish people here in Scotland than an English ignoramous.  Nobody I know has problems with the Welsh either.  The oldest poem in the Brythonic language (a precursor of Welsh) Y Gododdin was wirtte in the area of Scotland I come from.  Welsh as you call it was spoken in parts of Scotland until the 12th/13th Centuries.<br>  <br>  My "nationalism" isn't based on hating anyone.  If I wanted to do that i'd join the BNP or UK Independence parties.  I just have a low toleration level for idiots.|`|6kvyXUNWaa	I'm Scottish, and I don't agree with the majority of your 'question'.<br>  <br>  Personally, I find your views rather offensive. As far as I am aware, Scottish people do NOT have a problem with Welsh people. If anything, the only people we have a 'problem' with is English people.<br>  <br>  And even then, it's extremely exaggerated by people who don't actually have a clue what Scots relationships with the English are like.<br>  <br>  In fact, half of my family are living in England, and my father's family originate from Ireland.<br>  <br>  I don't support Celtic or Rangers, however I feel that they are unfairly accused of being extremely bigoted, because really, which football team isn't?<br>  <br>  And we aren't trying to wipe out our language, correct me if I'm wrong, but there are around 60,000 people in Scotland who speak Scottish Gaelic. English is used as our first language because it's used universally all over the world. <br>  <br>  Who else besides Scots, perhaps other nationalities in the UK, would even understand what we were saying if we spoke in Gaelic?<br>  <br>  I agree with you that many Scots people can be seen as angry, however I would justify this by saying we are a proud, passionate nation!<br>  <br>  If you really hate the Scots this much, what is your problem with independence?<br>  <br>  Vote YES in the referendum, and stop complaining over Y!A.|`|amk46WUeaa	Other countries speak English as an official language.<br>  <br>  Nigeria, India, Australia, Canada, Philippines, USA etc.|`|FCBJMSuxaa	Rwy'n Gymro a dwi'n siarad Cymraeg a dwi wedi gweld yr agwedd yma o'r blaen mae rhaid i mi gyfafedd ond dwi ddim yn cytuno gyda chi o gwbwl mae'n ddrwg gen i, Mae'n amhosib beirniadu cenedl a phobl ar sail yr agwedd ystrydebol yma mae'n amharchus, sarhaus ac yn anghwrtais i rhan fwyaf o'r albanwyr. <br>  <br>  I am a Welshman and I speak welsh and i can see some of your points but i have to admit that i do not agree with you at all I'm sorry to say. It's impossible to judge a nation and a people on this stereotypic attitude, It's disrespectful, offensive and rude to most Scots.|`|mvuLRUmZaa	I am Welsh and I disagree entirely with your assertion that Scots are anti-Welsh. Nothing could be further from the truth. You go to Edinburgh to watch Scotland play Wales at rugby and see how welcoming and hospitable the Scots are towards the Welsh. I think it must be your girlfreind's attitude that makes people dislike her. A lot of Gogs (North Wales people) go around with a chip on their shoulder  anyway so it comes as no surprise.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I don't know why your girlfriend has had a lot of hassle for being Welsh.  I've never heard anyone here saying that they hate Welsh people, and I've lived here all my life.  <br>  <br>  Maybe she received a bit of a slagging, but that's an entirely different thing.  We slag off people from different parts of Scotland, and I'm sure they're the same with Glaswegians, but it's nothing that needs to be taken seriously.  <br>  <br>  How many Scottish people have you actually met?|`|SDcFOv9Vaa	I have nothing against Wales and neither do the Scots that I know. <br>  You have raised many points the first the language Gaelic which was banned after the battle of Culloden along with everything do to do with the clan mentality which nearly wiped out the language and is slowly being revived. <br>  Second we do not hate England it is a rivalry much like England’s with Germany and France but I’ am sure you don’t hate those nations. Besides there is a lot of resentment down South towards the Scots nowadays I would say your argument would swing both ways.<br>  Our national anthem is in English but England doesn’t even have a national anthem they use the UKs anthem where is the national identity there. This did include a verse about crushing us rebellious Scots before it was removed.<br>  It is the right of any nation to chose independence if they want it. If Kososvo and Montenegro had the bravery to go it alone and they have not descended into anarchy or collapsed into nothingness.<br>  We didn’t ask to join England the King of England and Scotland saw the opportunity to unite the Kingdoms and bribed many of the Scottish parliament into voting and those who refused the bribe abstained to vote to quote Burns "We are bought and sold for English gold. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation" and I know there is an argument against this view and I’ am sure the Panama fiasco played a part.<br>  Bigotry is a problem in the West of Scotland which isn’t nice having being a victim of it myself however both clubs have done a lot to eradicate the problem.<br>  If your girlfriend got hassle for being Welsh all I can say is all nations in the world have idiots.

bnRDldxbaa	Styles of art that flourished during this short period are markedly different from other Egyptian art, bearing a variety of affectations, from elongated heads to protruding stomachs, exaggerated ugliness and the beauty of Nefertiti. Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten's family was depicted in a decidedly naturalistic manner, and they are clearly shown displaying affection for each other. Nefertiti also appears beside the king in actions usually reserved for a Pharaoh, suggesting that she attained unusual power for a queen. Artistic representations of Akhenaten give him a strikingly bizarre appearance, with an elongated face, slender limbs, a protruding belly, wide hips, and an overall pear-shaped body. It has been suggested that the pharaoh had himself depicted in this way for religious reasons, or that it exaggerates his distinctive physical traits. Until Akhenaten's mummy is located and identified, such theories remain speculative.|`|DSVUvfGuaa	I never met any of them in real , sorry can′t answer you the right way.<br>  loooool|`|UAh16Trtaa	What?|`|lVkaALbOaa	ummm i don't know|`|kH4Lb0ztaa	No i think they are stylised, i think it unlikely these statues are a true and accurate representation of akhenaten or his daughters, though those of Nefertiti do not on the whole seem to be as stylised. why i have no idea.

Though i do realise that just becuase i have not seen one who looks like this does not mean they cannot look like this.|`|b7132e649b5514cba275bcc7b9d9c640aa	Yes they are realistic. Akhnaton gave the artists the freedom to depict him as he was.<br>  There exceptions though. This freedom resulted in the first caricature in history. Those who were against his new religion presented caricature of Nefertiti. This can be seen in the Cairo museum. It is a carved stone depicting the Queen who was famous for her beauty with an exagerated crown, exagerated neck and shoulders and an ugly face.|`|BbRnBRXraa	???? ??? ???|`|f6L8C3mJaa	yes. shouldn't be exaggerated much unlike those from ptolemaic dynasty.|`|5MtOAJ7Baa	yes they are true cuz most Egyptians have the same  features those statues were made with|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	let me guess the portraits were to brown and you think that they should have been whiter?|`|hhhk499qaa	Yes of course they are true.

In fact, it was a backwater for most of Arab history. Jerusalem never served as a provincial capital under Muslim rule nor was it ever a Muslim cultural center. For Jews, the entire city is sacred, but Muslims revere a site — the Dome of the Rock — not the city. "To a Muslim.there is a profound difference between Jerusalem and Mecca or Medina. The latter are holy places containing holy sites." Besides the Dome of the Rock, , Jerusalem has no major Islamic significance Before 1865, the entire population of Jerusalem lived behind the Old City walls (what today would be considered part of the eastern part of the city). Later, the city began to expand beyond the walls because of population growth, and both Jews and Arabs began to build in new areas of the city.<br>  <br>  By the time of partition, a thriving Jewish community was living in the eastern part of Jerusalem, an area that included the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. This area of the city also contains many sites of importance to the Jewish religion, including the City of David, the Temple Mount and the Western Wall. In addition, major institutions like Hebrew University and the original Hadassah Hospital are on Mount Scopus — in eastern Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  The only time that the eastern part of Jerusalem was exclusively Arab was between 1949 and 1967, and that was because Jordan occupied the area and forcibly expelled all the Jews.<br>  Plus Israel is not destroying anything, all what she is doing is improving the city, for all, yes incl the Arab citizens.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	It turns out that the hole old testament bible is all about the that land and its seed.

pcHp7Dgkaa	I answered your other question and while I live in Brisbane and love it here, I didn't suggest Brisbane as the opportunities in advertising will be very limited here and you're unlikely to earn as much as in Sydney.<br>  <br>  There's no doubt that our weather is several cuts above Sydney's, but our public transport is only so-so and while the nightlife isn't bad here, it's not as good or as varied as Sydney's - that's not surprising given that Sydney's population is 2.3 times the size of Brisbane's.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Dan B, I'm also Canadian, live in Montreal. I have done a number of vacation trips to Australia. Because of your particular vocation being advertising you have two choices, Melbourne or Sydney. For what your looking for going by experience, I would go for Sydney. If the beaches inspire you, and your one for sun and surf, the beaches from what they call the South Coast right up to the North Coast would keep you busy exploring. When you8 settle and have vacation, I would also Explore the beaches of the Sunshine and Gold Coast of Queensland, you will be very enthusiastically surprised my friend.<br>  <br>  As for nightlife in Sydney, more than you can handle.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|s87m8DoFaa	WESTERN AUSTRALIA...well Perth to be precise cause there's not much anyway else between here and Sydney :P :P :P.<br>  <br>  Night life is good (not that I experience much of it....for now) and we're still riding a boom (economic, not an underground explosion or anything). Transport...is sh** but I think that's because we're in the middle of nowhere:there's a bus every hour from my house to Joondalup (a city in perth, look it up :P) which is crazy...should be every 10 mins so I don't have to drive :P.|`|JUOsTVOLaa	SYDNEY SYDNEY!<br>  i was brought up in sydney and it is great. the winter is cold and the summer is stinking hot. you can live by the northan beaches (best) in the suburbs or in the city.<br>  syndey has uncomplicated easy to use transportation brisbane is good but it rains alot .<br>  id say sidney.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	brisbane sucks... i grew up in newcastle, i have lived in sydney and now temporarily in brisbane... its too hot up here... sydney and newcastle are just right... although sydney would have more opportunities etc than newcastle offcourse<br>  <br>  maybe you could go to the central coast.. around avoca or terrigal beach... it's roughly an hours drive from there to sydney, but really special.. not as fullon as sydney, more relaxed and the beaches are unreal and less crowded|`|90tPT5nlaa	I think you'd be best off in Sydney, Sydney's weather is really pretty good. Brisbane would be the second best choice.<br>  <br>  Sydney's a pretty amazing place - I think you'll love it. The only problem is the price.|`|nbeCb5dfaa	I lived in Australia for a year (2006) and as beautiful as Sydney was I would rather live in Brisbane. <br>  <br>  Sydney would certainly have a better job market and be much more exciting, but it was still a city. So you still had to watch out for certain areas and the usual precautions that need to be taken while living in the city. I'm originally from the city back in the states (Boston to be exact) so I'm aware of how to be safe and I still got jumped on my way to the train station with some friends. <br>  <br>  Brisbane on the other hand is really nice. The trains aren't bad and you can take a commuter rail to where the beaches are. I actually lived by the Gold Gold, Surfers Paradise area and that was about a 45 minute train ride. Again the public transportation wasn't the fastest, but it wasn't fast anywhere in Australia. You have to remember Aussie's are A LOT more laid back than Americans. <br>  <br>  Another option is that no matter where you live there are a TON of places that will rent you a vehicle for a day, week or even months. A few friends and myself rented a car for 2 months when we lived there. <br>  <br>  Brisbane is located in the tropical region of Australia anyways. Plenty of beach places around like Byron's Bay and the Gold Coast. Sydney can get a little chilly at night in the "winter" months because its further south.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful too you.
AA10250756	How much can you afford and do you need to be near where there is employment? If you are going to need a job, most of the jobs are in Tampa. The nicest places to live there are Davis Island, Hyde Park, Avila, Culbreath Isles. The houses are not cheap there. If you want to be down by the water at the bottom of St. Petersburg and money is not a problem, then Tierra Verde. Bellair is also an exclusive area. If you can't afford $1million and up, let us know and we will come up with other neighborhoods

48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	First, make sure you have a good BIKE LOCK.<br>  <br>  Second, I would recommend a small backpack HOWEVER, you are not allowed to take packs inside the US Capitol, Wash Monument and some of the museums.<br>  <br>  Frankly, $200 is plenty of walking around money for Wash DC, because yes, most of the good stuff is free anyways.<br>  <br>  Be sure to check-out the DC Metro (subway) website to see what sorts of deals they have on fare cards.  I am not up to date on the stuff, but they do have some "ride all day for one price" cards and stuff like that.  So, give take a look.<br>  <br>  No food, drink, packs, nail clippers, etc., allowed inside the Capitol building or the Wash monument.  Both of those tours are free.  BUT, you have to get tickets in advance and they usually run-out in the mornings.  So, get them early and then do tour around the other places before it's your time for your tour.  I recommend both tours and be sure to bring your digital camera to capture some memories.<br>  <br>  The absolute best are the Smithsonian museums (plural).  Air & Space is my favorite.  American History is my second fav, then natural history.  I also like the National Art Gallery (some great painting there) and the Hirshorn is worth a walk through as well.  Again, all free, but travel light.<br>  <br>  Best place to grab a bite to eat on the National Mall is the food court at the Air & Space Museum.  They have McDonald's, Pizza and some other sandwiches.  I think they also have an ice cream spot in there too.  If you try to buy your food anywhere else, you are going to pay through the eyeballs and get low quality food.  (They have a cafe in the Smithsonian "Castle" that's overpriced and likes to serve stuff that's been sitting there for 3 days.  Don't do it!)<br>  <br>  So, there you have it.  The cool places to see and visit are free and the only outlay of money you will have is for Metro fare cards and food at the Air & Space food court.  You'll do fine!<br>  <br>  Lastly...with the bike thing.  I would recommend you do a biking tour of the town first...just to get a feel for how much area you can travel.  You can start down by the Potomac river (tidal basin) and see all the cool monuments.  I usually walk it myself...all the way from National Airport, along the Potomac, cross the bridge at Arlington, check-out tidal basin, Jefferson Memorial, FDR memorial, Vietnam Memorial, Lincoln memorial, WWII Memorial, Wash Moument, then you are on the main stretch with the Smithsonian and the Capitol.  Believe me, if I can cover that all on foot, you can do it easly on a bike.  Get all the great photos of the outside of the places at that time.  After that, THEN you can plan on what kind of fare card you need for the Metro.  Hell, you might decided the bike gets you everywhere and just skip the Metro.|`|4i59X44Laa	Yes you can take your bike on the Metro Train (during non rush hour traffic or during a major event) and metro buses have a rack on the front.<br>  Almost all the museums are free.<br>  10 tips for Washington, D.C., tourists<br>  <br>  <br>  By Kelly DiNardo, Special for USA TODAY <br>  The ins and outs, quirks and curiosities of a city can take years to learn. If that doesn't quite fit into your time frame, you're in luck. With these tips, you'll manage your trip to Washington, D.C., like a pro. <br>  RECOMMENDED EVENTS: Washington, D.C., is a year-round playground CITY GUIDE: Washington, D.C., attractions, hotels and more <br>  1. Avoid driving. Legend has it that French engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant designed Washington's streets to confuse and frustrate enemy troops who might attack the city. Anyone attempting to navigate this city will understand why the legend persists. The city is divided into the four quadrants of a compass – NW, NE, SE, SW. The U.S. Capitol sits at the center of the quadrants, even though it is not at the center of the city, so Northwest is the largest area. The boundaries of each quadrant are North Capitol Street, South Capitol Street, East Capitol and the National Mall. That's where the street addresses start and become numbers and the letters of the alphabet. The lettered streets run east and west and numbered streets run north and south. To add to this directional befuddlement, the city also has many diagonal avenues (most of which are named after states) that run through a series of white-knuckle-inducing traffic circles. And beware the freeway ramps that appear out of nowhere and may take you across a bridge to Virginia before you know it. <br>  2. Mind your Metro manners. The D.C. transit system prides itself on being one of the cleanest and most orderly in the country. A few simple dos and don'ts will help you navigate the Metro with ease. When on the escalator, do stand to the right and walk to the left, letting those in a hurry pass by. Don't eat or drink on the Metro. Do stand aside and take a moment to figure out where you are going. The direction a Metro train is going is determined by its final destination. For example, an Orange train heading west will say, "Orange Line to Vienna." There are large, clear maps in each station, so you should be able to figure it all out. Don't stop in the entry of the Metro car, but move completely into the car. Also, note our underground rail system is called the Metro, don't refer to it as the subway. <br>  3. Consider fall. Visitors flock to Washington between April and August. The city can be unbearably hot and humid in the summer, which makes trekking around to all those outside monuments a sweltering affair. Remember, D.C. is lovely all year round – especially in the fall. <br>   <br>  4. Visit your Congressperson. Call ahead for a visit with your local representative. Congressional offices can often offer special services and tips for visitors. <br>  5. Eat your way around the world. Washington is a true melting pot with residents from around the world, which is reflected on the menus at area restaurants. Forget the chain restaurants you probably have at home. Instead, make like Columbus and discover the city's global palette. Local favorites include Mexican tapas at Oyamel, Indian at Rasika, Ethiopian at Etete, Italian at Dino and Belgian at Brasserie Beck. <br>  6. Plan ahead. You can simply walk into many of Washington's attractions without tickets or reservations, but some of the biggies require a little advance preparation. Visitors interested in taking the self-guided tour of the White House must be part of a group of ten or more and request the tour through their member of Congress. You can submit a request up to six months in advance, but you won't learn the date and time of your tour until about a month in advance. Guided tours of the U.S. Capitol are available from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Free tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis at the Capitol Guide Service Kiosk beginning at 9 a.m. You must use your tickets when you pick them up. The same-day, free tickets to the Washington Monument can be difficult to get. For $1.50, you can make advance reservations through recreation.gov. <br>  7. Pack your running shoes or bicycle. With over 200 miles of trails in Washington, jogging and biking are popular activities. Runners interested in taking in the monuments and looping around the Mall should aim for an early morning jog, as the area gets crowded later in the day. Or head to Rock Creek Park, an 1,800-acre maze of beautiful, well-marked trails, stretching 11 miles from the Lincoln Memorial to beyond the Maryland border. A paved path runs from the Kennedy Center through the park. You can also pick up trails near Dupont Circle and the National Zoo. <br>  8. Go celebrity spotting. L.A. and New York have movie stars and models. In D.C. the power players are the politicos. Keep your eyes peeled and you might spot a few Washington celebrities. Classi|`|JuiZR23Paa	I live right near D.C, and I've been there over 20 times.<br>  <br>  The Air & Space museum is AMAZING.<br>  <br>  The museums are all free pretty much.  Theres also plays at the Kennedy Center.<br>  The subway is called the metro too. Haha.<br>  You can pretty much walk everywhere.<br>  But a bike would be beautiful to have!  It has a mall (green area)  and D.C, is a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|I20mtK1Oaa	Most of the museums are free, yes.  There are also free concerts at the Kennedy Center every night at 6pm.<br>  <br>  DC is full of happy hour food specials too.  If you're looking for cheap eats, head to a restaurant/bar and see what their specials are.  A bunch of places have half price burgers on Sundays (Hawk and Dove on Capitol Hill) and Mondays (Mr. Henry's on Capitol Hill).<br>  <br>  I think you'll do fine with $200 for two days.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I second the thing about the bike lock.  You will definitely need that around the city, but biking is a terrific way to get around!<br>  <br>  Have a great trip!!|`|TskZHzZyaa	Having a bike in DC is an awesome way to see a lot.  We were there seven days and rented bikes our last day.  We wish we had rented them the first day and had them all week.  Check the Metro site below - if it is like Chicago bikes are not allowed on trains during morning and evening rush hours unless the bike is folding.  So if you're leaving at 5PM and taking the train to the airport you may have to take it there before rush hour, or earlier than you planned.|`|PIa2uz6Uaa	Yeah pretty much all museums will be free and yes you are allowed to take your bike on the subway but no pets or food.|`|Q440sUWqaa	dude 200 bucks??  you prob don't realize how expensive dc is do you??  oh nvm you already have a room.  sorry i didn't read the whole thing.  ok  yes all of the musuems are free. The metro is 1.50 each way. You can take your bike on the metro. I would suggest eating at fast food place. Everywhere else is way too expense. This sounds stupid but make sure you use the bathroom before you go out. Most places don't like people using the bathroom.  Sometimes you have to get a key with a chain on it and its a big hassle. I was from the suburbs and this always pissed me off was in the city. what else?? just realize that dc is a dangerous city. be aware of your surroundings. Try to stay in places with large crowds. Don't go out late at night by yourself. Even the mall is dangerous.  But all of that aside i hope you enjoy dc. I was so lucky to grow up there. I now live in NC and i am bored as hell. People are so ignorant but thats a diff story.  good luck my friend

yKIr3C40aa	Yes, you can withdraw money from any Japan Post or 7-11 convenience store ATM. Citibank and Shinsei Bank ATMs will also work, but they're not nearly as common. Most other ATMs will not work with international ATM cards.<br>  <br>  Be careful, though, Bank of America charges a $5 fee for each withdrawal from an international ATM, so you might want to take out as much as you can each time. It's generally safe to carry around cash in Japan, so don't worry about that.<br>  <br>  If you have yen left over, be sure to exchange it in Japan, because the bank fees for currency exchange are much lower in Japan than in the USA.|`|GTAKIE9kaa	no way unless you have credit card|`|MyP6wDizaa	Yes, take a look at the back of your atm card. If there is a mark such as Plus, Star or Cirrus. You can use it at all ATMs in Japan.

When me and my mom were at Narita airport, they had an ATM there that took a lot of foreign credit card companies.  We had VISA so of course that's so common but so is Bank of America.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that you get a lot your money out in cash while you're at the airport because after that, me and my mother had to go to the bank near the main Tokyo station and we were SO worried that it wouldn't work.  <br>  It did work but yeah, caused a lot of stress on our part and a lot of stuff in Japan is usually bought with cash.

PA0bGBtCaa	I work for a major airline, and this is how the Lost and Found process works among the big carriers. First: It all boils down to when the item was discovered on the plane. Was it found when the plane was at your destination by the flight crew while cleaning the plane? I would say this is the best option because it was a backpack in the overhead. HOWEVER, 95% of Southwest's flights are "thru" flights were people stay on the plane. So a backpack could belong to any one of those people. And if it was a thru flight, then the flight attendants wouldn't bat an eye at a leftover backpack in the overhead.<br>  <br>  Two: How many more flights did that plane make? If it was the last flight of the night, or not a thru flight, then all overhead bags need to be handed over to the local airport where Southwest has a lost and found at each station.<br>  <br>  Basically their process will be to start contacting all the cities that the plane visited starting with the one you arrived in and then every city thereafter. Hell, you could do this process on your own by knowing the flight number. You can visit <a href="http://www.flightaware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightaware.com</a> and type in WN(flight number) in the search box. It will show a list the past few days that flight number made. Click on your date and you can see a graphical map of all the cities the plane flew to that day on that same flight number. Then you can call Southwest again and get the local airport phone numbers from them. Then you would just simply ask the local agents there.<br>  <br>  I know it's a lot of leg work on your part, but considering how large Southwest Airlines are, your claim will be "pending" for quite a while, and there's no gurantee that it would be found. The longer it sits in an airport, the lower your chances are at finding it.|`|11SCey7Xaa	I haven't had a lost/found for the south west. I live in Australia, when i went on of the buslines, i left my bag on it and i lived like 50 Km aways. I know this basically has nothing to do with your story, but i  got my stuff back within a day. Your will properly take longer since you travelled further. I wouldn't loose hope airlines are pretty good with that kind of stuff because once the flight attendants are finished they search the cabin for lost property. <br>  <br>  Good Luck - hope your daughter get's her NDS and MP3 back ! =]<br>  <br>  Can you please answer my question?.|`|bf6bd40eea65d8afc4e198b1c4d5a03aaa	Was the item lost on your trip home?  If so, items left on board are held at the airport baggage office.  It's very possible that your daughter's Nintendo is at the airport.  Perhaps if you have time this weekend you should drive there and make an inquiry at the Southwest baggage office.  Of course there's also the possibility the backpack wasn't noticed until after the plane departed for it's next destination.  In that case you'll have to wait for the lost and found process to run it's course.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

The most beautiful part is the area of the park called Kensington Gardens at the western end of the park bordering Kensington High Street. Other central London Parks worth visiting are St James' Park and Regents Park. Hampstead Heath in north west London is huge, largely wooded and is good for birds, wildlife and superb views; Within Hampstead Heath you will find the beautiful stately home of Kenwood House with its superb art collection and gardens. The largest park in the London area is Richmond Park near Richmond Surrey, which is a national nature reserve and is renowned for its herds of deer and ancient trees.
b1w5FUGzaa	Yes,  your room on the cruise is just like a hotel room, exact same thing, but the toilets are like the ones on an airplane lol very powerful !  Also, sometimes you can feel the ship rocking when you're in the shower so be careful, best to bring a pair of slippers to wear in the shower that have a good grip on the bottom !  Cruises are fun, you will have a great time !|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Of course. A cruise ship is a hotel on water.|`|lLN8VD20aa	Not in cruises in the artic circle.<br>  <br>  Such hot water would further melt the fragile glaciers|`|DeoDkG1Waa	Hot water is produced as a by product of their engines.  It is never quite so hot (although hot enough) when docked in port.  Other times it is extremely hot - hence the warning signs on the bathroom mirror!|`|AA11008781	NO YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE OCEAN TO TAKE A BATH!!!<br>  <br>  JUST KIDDING.....OF COURSE HOT WATER IS AVAILABLE ARE YOU KIDDING???|`|94b8KImYaa	Of course - also in the sink, hot water is available.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	Yes it is!|`|2Hraw073aa	Yes my dear - considering taking a cruise is one of the more expensive arts of holidaying, i would certainly hope so!  It would be like buying a Mercedes S class and it not having air-con!  :D|`|69442f28405cb7b4b2d9ecac676332ceaa	Yes, but it's not drinkable.

Everything is functional on cruiseships.|`|EgfL2c86aa	yes. in fact it can get so hot that it can burn you.|`|5b5b8e8087fb0045161251b9ffd1a88baa	Yes|`|KRJYth01aa	yes|`|zM9Lj21waa	yes it is...|`|6eLtoxikaa	yes, the cruise ship has built in water heaters, but the water is not completely purified, so dont drink it because it could result in sickness<br>   but dont worry, the water is safe to bathe in.
7toznquyaa	Not scams, but there are alot of caveats to these prices besides the fact that they are Per person, and the taxes will nearly double the price. <br>  <br>  There are also black out dates and only a couple of flights available at those prices.|`|yWjdRuhuaa	when it doubt do without!

fv2GAAdPaa	I would prefer Treasure Island. See linksbelow that consist of travel reviews from people who have been to both:<br>  <br>  Mandalay Bay:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://las-vegas-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d496876-Reviews-THEhotel_at_Mandalay_Bay-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html" rel="nofollow">http://las-vegas-hotels.tripadvisor.com/...</a><br>  <br>  Treasure Island:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://las-vegas-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91967-Reviews-Treasure_Island-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html" rel="nofollow">http://las-vegas-hotels.tripadvisor.com/...</a><br>  <br>  I hope I made your decison easier!<br>  <br>  =]|`|iN27E3WCaa	Mandalay Bay is nicer (aka newer), but Treasure Island has a better location on the strip.  MB is all the way at the south end whereas TI is more towards the middle.  If you plan on staying in/around your hotel I'd say that MB is better, but if you want to explore more of the strip I'd go with TI.  Keep in mind, however, that if you stay at MB you can easily just get on the monorail (to Excalibur) and then walk the rest of the strip so it's not that isolated.|`|lqXmvJdRaa	They are both very good places to stay. There is no such thing as a bad hotel on the strip. They are all either very good or they wouldn't be in business for very long. Check the prices on these places and see which one is better for you. Either one of these places is a good place to stay.
tpiznWzTaa	Would have to agree with bla bla. Unlike the U.S. which added 'stars' to the flag with the inclusion of Hawaii and Alaska (open to correction), the stars on the E.U. flag represent only the founder members and are therefore very unlikely to change.<br>  <br>   *edit*<br>  Just found this after a search.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The number of stars on the flag is fixed at 12, and is not related to the number of member states of the EU. This is because it originally was the flag of the Council of Europe, and does not have a relationship with the EU.[12] In 1953, the Council of Europe had 15 members; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member, and would not change based on future members. West Germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of Saarland, and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region.[13] Twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of perfection and completeness[12] because of the ubiquity of the number for groups in European cultures and traditions such as:<br>  <br>  12 hours on a clock <br>  12 months in a year <br>  12 symbols of the zodiac <br>  12 apostles <br>  12 sons of Jacob <br>  12 tribes of Israel <br>  12 Biblical minor prophets <br>  12 ounces in a troy pound <br>  12 semitones in an octave <br>   12 days of Christmas <br>  12 Caesars chronicled by Suetonius <br>  12 Olympian gods <br>  12 labours of Hercules <br>  12 tables of Roman Law <br>  12 sons of Odin <br>  12 books of Paradise Lost and the Aeneid|`|dpKntiZoaa	The EU flag represents all EU member states.<br>  <br>  Currently that is 27 states and the stars are NOT related to the amount of members (past or present), and therefore the flag with a fixed 12 stars will not be updated in the future "number twelve is traditionally the symbol of perfection, completeness and unity"<br>  <br>  What is generally not known is that as well as representing the  European Union, it also represents the Council of Europe as well (47 member states) but is commonly known as the flag of the EU.<br>  <br>  You can read more here <a href="http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/emblem/index_en.htm" rel="nofollow">http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/emblem/inde...</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Europe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Eur...</a>|`|6W1dM1n1aa	It Doesn't represent a country but the stars represent each of the 12 original founding members.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It represents all the countries that are members of the EU.|`|HQKuzxulaa	The European Union. Each star represents a Country although the new flag will have more stars because there are now more countries in the EU.
CfmoqmV4aa	I just got back from Paris.  It was great.  My best suggestion is to walk and walk and walk in Central Paris.  They have great tour buses you can take to the popular monuments, which is helpful if you don't want to hazard the metro.  The Red buses run later at night, but my friend and I used the Green and White buses.  They go more places but don't run as late.  So if you end up on the last bus it gets to the end of the line and you have to get off.  However, that just leads to walking in Central Paris and we ended up finding the best little patisseries and restaurants in just that way!  <br>  <br>  We stayed at the Hotel Eiffel, which is a tiny hotel just 600 metres from the Eiffel Tower.  We couldn't get lost because if we could see the Tower we could get home no problem!!!  I would recommend that hotel.  It is very tiny, but really, all you need is a place to lay your head at night!  <br>  <br>  You have to buy a hot chocolate with cream from the vendor across the street from the Eiffel Tower. Amazing!  <br>  <br>  You must go to the Louvre of course and that is really an all day event.  It could be a several day event if you had the time, but who does?<br>  <br>  If you like Monet, go to the Musee D'Orsay as well. <br>  <br>  I could go on forever.  You will love it in Paris.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	Why do you people spend all that money to go some place and then you are too CHEAP to BUY A GUIDE BOOK.. which will tell you everything you want to know and answer all those questions and more.<br>  <br>  Fodor has a VERY GOOD GUIDE BOOK on Paris.. I suggest you BUY ONE.|`|noiX4SpTaa	Definitely take a boat tour of the River Seine. It will show you TONS of landmarks that you might not be able to go see on foot. It's about an hour to two long if I remember right and it's a great way to see the city.<br>  <br>  Eiffel Tower...go in the evening before the sun sets. Go up in the day and come down at night. You'll get to see the city in day and the city of lights at night. Buy the tickets to take the elevator up instead of the stairs. It will save you time since you are on a time crunch. There will be a long line to get from the 2nd level to the top. If you don't make it to the top, it's okay. Everything just gets smaller to see and you can see plenty from the second level.<br>  <br>  Arc de Triumph<br>  <br>  Walk le champs elyse boulevard.<br>  <br>  Visit the Lourve and see the most important paintings and sculptures (Mona Lisa, etc)<br>  <br>  Notre Dame<br>  <br>  Take the metro to St. Michel. Great cheap tourist shopping and good landmarks to see|`|HzipzzXKaa	If you are only in Paris for a week (I'll try not to cry) then the most you can do is go to Le Louvre and spend a day there. Go to a boulangerie and get a baguette and make a sandwich. Take the sandwich with you and go sit in a park, maybe the Tuleries or something and spend a couple hours watching people walk by and relaxing. (This is probably the thing you should do the first day you get there) In the evening go sit on the Champs de Mars, around 7 or 8 and stay there for a couple hours taking pictures, sitting on the grass ect... If you are in Paris for only a week there's not much you can do because there's not enough time. I've spent almost 7 months in Paris and I still haven't done all of the tourist things or anything so theres no way you can see everything. I'm leaving to go to college there in a year or so and I'll be there for 5 years and I can guarantee you that I won't see everything in Paris and I'll be there for five years! So just see a few things here and there but spend most of your time just living like the Parisians do. What you should do though is take a boat tour, not just any boat tour but a tour of the Canals under Paris. Not many people have heard about this but it was amazing. They have guides that speak both English and French. Here's the website for more info. <a href="http://www.pariscanal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pariscanal.com/</a> <br>  <br>  Hope you don't do too many things, most people who try and cram everything into a week end up having a bad experience and never want to return.<br>  <br>  Bon Voyage!<br>  <br>  <br>  A lot of people think that you can see most of Paris from the second level of the Eiffel Tower but if you actually take the time and go to the top floor (I mean the very very tippie top) it is well worth your time. I've been on the Eiffel tower once during the day and once during the night and they were both breathtaking experiences. But it's up to you.<br>  <br>  If you get on the metro and take line 6 and get off at Cambronne Station there's a Cafe on the corner of Blvd. Grenelle and Avenue de Lowendal called Le Square Cafe. They have some really good food. We eat there quite a bit.
aqLLbzJQaa	It is apparently named after the Roman Numeral for 500<br>  <br>  see here :- <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.picturenation.co.uk/view/info/75959/road-dual-carriageway" rel="nofollow">http://www.picturenation.co.uk/view/info...</a>  <br>  <br>  ...|`|LGCsxlfTaa	disrepair probably he he he|`|4kxg48quaa	There are two possible reasons. Firstly, and simply, 'D' is the Roman numeral for 500, and the 'D' road is the A500.<br>  <br>  However, and more likely, the shape the road forms on its original course between M6 J15 and M6 J16 vaguely resembles the curve of a 'D'. It's part of a clever transport policy whereby you keep through traffic on the motorway and far away from the city (the straight bit of the 'D'), leaving just a junction at either side. It works too, after all if we're honest, the M6 here flows much better than it does at Birmingham.

The city is on the water and the archipelago is gorgeous. It's a lot larger city than Copenhagen, which is nice but feels more like a small town than a big city. Stockholm has great night life, interesting museums, a historic Old Town, and friendly people.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Copenhagen or Stockholm. Skip Oslo, it's similar to Stockholm but smaller and much more expensive. If you go to Norway, Bergen or Stavanger are much better choices.<br>  <br>  Some museums in Stockholm are free, or have free days/hours. Unfortunately, the best attractions (like Skansen or the Vasa Museum) have entry fees. Stockholm is a beautiful city though, and it's worthwhile to just walk around and explore. Gamla Stan (Old Town), Haga Park, Djurg?rden, Kulturhuset and various churches are all free ways to enjoy the city.<br>  <br>  Copenhagen is very cozy and has several free museums (or free days) as well as nice waterfront parks. There's art scattered around the city, and you can rent a bike (free) to explore. Christiana is an interesting self-governing area of Copenhagen which has lots of galleries and vintage shops nearby.

lys5kB9Daa	I really like Royal Caribbean but they are too expensive then Carnival would be a decent choice. <br>  The rooms are teeny tiny- on every cruise line, it's just the most efficient way to pack the ship. Think about a regular size hotel room- then cut it in thirds and you get that. Basically it just fits the bed, the closet and a small bathroom. You can request to have 2 twin beds with a walkway in between or 1 queen bed in the middle of the room. They have beds above that, that fold down from the wall and make it look like bunk beds- this is where your son would sleep- or you if you dont feel it's safe for him, but I slept up there when I was 7 and it was just fine.<br>  The only strict schedules are when the ship is leaving is leaving port. It docks at about 6am, and lets people off at 8am but you must be back on the ship by 5pm or it will leave without you. <br>  Meals are included in the price and you are assigned a table in the dining room. The dining time is set for example breakfast you must be there between 7-9, dinner you choose 6-8 or 8-10 but you cant just waltz in at 7 if you chose the 8-10 block befcause other people will have that table at that time. however, this is just the main dining room- you dont have to eat there, if you want to eat at another time- there are places all over the ship to get food, like burger joints, ice cream stands, room service. Every ship I've been on these were also included in the price. But the tip is not included- you have the same waiter every night at your table and on the last day you are expected to tip him for the whole week (about $100). Same with the room cleaning service (about $50). Oh yea, alcohol is NOT included and on certain cruise lines soda might cost more too.<br>  I would highly suggest bringing your son to the kids group meetings- they introduce him to other kids his age, and have supervised activies such as scavenger hunts, fashion shows, coloring time, etc. It was so much fun when I was that age, and you can come and go as you like, it's not like you must bring him everyday. I made pen pals from my cruises when I was young, so that was fun!<br>  Well, hope all this helps- I really like to talk people into cruises because they are awesome, so much fun!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I've done the Carnival cruise to the Bahamas and loved it. Everything but your soda and alcoholic drinks are included in the fare. You can eat all day and night if you wish. Dining in the dining room is scheduled but they have buffets on the lido deck for hours on end. Lots of kid activities, the last ship I was on had water slides on the top deck. You can either purchase shore excursions or just meander around the ports for free. The rooms are plenty big since you are really never in them. They have soap, shampoo, conditioner and razors in the bathrooms for you. Pack comfortable shoes for Nassau, the streets are very uneven. You will have a blast!|`|AA12333875	I may be one the few who really like Norwegian.<br>  The cabins are like a hotel room. The is usually 2 single beds that can be pushed together to make a queen size bed and either bunk beds that fold down from the walls or a couch that turns into a bed, a desk, closet and restroom, TV.<br>   The strict schedules are when departing ports of call & safety drill (once usually the first day).<br>  Meals are included in price. They do have specialty restaurants that cost extra. Each day there is a daily planner left in your cabin which includes ports of call, all activities on the ship & food.<br>  Advice - go and enjoy being waited on hand & foot and see some amazing places.<br>  You will meet people from all over.<br>  Enjoy.|`|YIp9Q2DYaa	I went on Carnival Victory; salt water pools, bad kid's camp, and small rooms, including the suite room.<br>  My friends went on the Norwegian Spirit and Dawn.<br>  They said they were a lot better than Carnival.<br>  So my advice, you go on Norwegian Pearl.|`|EQbjmcYyaa	don't do norwegian<br>  <br>  not much to do on the ships and the food isn't very good|`|gXJdryRNaa	I am a diehard Norwegian Cruise Line fan.  My husband and I been on a few cruises with them and we love the Freestyle Cruising.  I would rather be able to eat when I want then have to sit at either 6:30 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. which is traditional on other cruise lines.  <br>  <br>  As for the meals, they are included on NCL if you eat in the main dining rooms (usually 2 of them).  The other restaurants may charge a surcharge of $10 per person to eat there.  <br>  <br>  NCL also has good activities for kids that can help keep them occupied with fun activities.  They also offer babysitting services in the evening for a small price.  The activities will vary depending on which ship you take regardless of which cruise line you choose.  They are similar but not quite the same.  <br>  <br>  As for the staterooms, again, it depends on the cruise lines and the ships and the level you choose.  Most have 2 twin beds that can convert to queen size and some also have room for an additional person.  <br>  <br>  The best way is to go to their web sites to see what their itineraries are and the ships are like.  NCL actually lets you see the ships and the rooms and click on the restaurants and other places on the ship (including the kids area).<br>  <br>  Plan the trip carefully and make sure all your documents are in order.  That will make the cruising experience go much smoother.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|wyNVJXUiaa	I am a huge fan of Carnival ships.  We always have TONS of fun on Carnival...  it really is the 'fun ship'.  We took a 7 day cruise to the eastern Caribbean and went on the water slides everyday.  There is also dance clubs, piano bars, etc.  It is perfect for someone just looking for casual fun!<br>  <br>  Bedrooms are small though (for all cruise ships) but they are sufficient because you don't spend that much time in the bedroom anyhow.<br>  <br>  As far as meals are concerned - yes, all meals are included (I believe the drinks are separate).<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN!

There would be no way I would have ever thought they would have ever met each other.<br>  <br>  No one is more Canadian then another Canadian, we are all Canadian. <br>  <br>  Pump gas or live on the streets, guess it would all depend on your motivation level, if you want the good things in life you have to work. If you have to leave your safe zone in order to provide for you family, you do what you gotta do! I would rather pump gas in the Yukon then live on the streets in Toronto. <br>  <br>  BTW your one question about its and it's, when I do that it is only because I am too lazy to put the ' , actually most of the time I do not even bother to correct my grammar, I do not have the time!|`|QHaIKYUraa	Can someone really be "MORE" Canadian? I guess it depends on how far their family goes back living there. Just because they live in Canada doesn't mean that they all know each other- no. And whether to pump or be street- it all depends on personality, relatives, and friends.

He must sign a royal decree for elections to be held.|`|5rRnSNQhaa	off course it needs|`|3P1EEZGdaa	The Thai constitution is long but from what I can see, not only is HM The King's consent necessary but, according to the way the constitution is written, dissolution of the House (which triggers the process for a new elections) is HM The King's prerogative power. <br>  <br>  "Section 108. The King has the prerogative to dissolve<br>  the House of Representatives for a new election of members of the House.<br>  The dissolution of the House of Representatives shall be<br>  made in the form of a Royal Decree in which the day <br>  for a new general election must be fixed within the period <br>  of not less than forty five days but not more than <br>  sixty days as from the date of the dissolution of the <br>  House of Representatives and such election day must be the same <br>  throughout the Kingdom.<br>  The dissolution of the House of Representatives may be<br>  made only once under the same circumstance."<br>  <a href="http://www.senate.go.th/th_senate/English/constitution2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.senate.go.th/th_senate/Englis...</a><br>  <br>  In the 1997 Constitution it said:<br>  "Section 116 The King has the prerogative to dissolve<br>  the House of Representatives for a new election of members<br>  of the House.<br>  The dissolution of the House of Representatives shall<br>  be made in the form of a Royal Decree in which the day for a<br>  new general election must be fixed within sixty days and<br>  such election day must be the same throughout the Kingdom.<br>  The dissolution of the House of Representatives may<br>  be made only once under the same circumstance."<br>  <br>  I guess that the difference is in the insertion of the "not less than forty five days" part.<br>  Obviously, I'm not a Thai constitutional lawyer, but my from my non-expert, amateur, farang reading it looks like the idea might be interpreted as being to stop it being too "snap".<br>  Wasn't Thaksin's final election, the one were he made it to 3-0-0, a snap election? Hard to remember now but I think it just might have been.<br>  <br>  Its interesting to compare with the Japanese constitution which says<br>  "The Emperor shall, with the advice and approval of the Cabinet, perform the following acts in matters of state on behalf of the people: ..... (4) Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet."<br>  Different country, different laws I guess.
3QtQZIJ1aa	On my previous trips to New Orleans, I have found the Holiday Inn Express on Carondelet to be nice and affordable.  The location is great for both activities you're wanting to do.  Carondelet turns into Bourbon once you cross Canal.  From the hotel you'll be 2 blocks from Bourbon!  The Superdome is about a five minute cab ride, although if the weather is nice you could walk it (I have several times).  I like the fact that when I stay at this hotel, I can leave my car parked until I'm ready to leave town.  It is a good central location.

ECB8u72Taa	The rubles that you have are the sixth Russian ruble, and they were taken out of circulation in 1997 due to hyperinflation.  For example, the 1993 series of the rubles were only worth a tenth of their value in 1995 (when ~3000 rubles exchanged for 1 dollar).  However, the cut-off date for bringing in old notes was in 1997, so your notes have no intrinsic value.<br>  <br>  If the notes are in good condition (ie, crisp or uncirculated), and of high denomination they could be sold to collectors.  For example, the 1995 500,000 ruble note is collectable (since it's an interesting/high denomination).|`|7sIYGEnmaa	Why don't you just contact the Central Bank of Russia and ask?

3a9735515aa048a223e622ca2583b4bfaa	We live here and have fished with several outfits. Our favorite is Pepe's Fleet. Not the fanciest boat, I would say mid range, but by far the best captain. We always catch fish with them!|`|siHN027laa	Call the El Cid (or email them) at the marina.<br>  A year or so ago, my best friend and his wife and my wife all met in Mazatlan for a vacation.<br>  It was my birthday that Friday so I treated everyone to a sportfishing trip. I rented the boat; a nice fishing cabin cruiser, with captain and a crew member for $380 for the day. <br>  (The boat charter place was down on the dock next to the El Cid. The resort had nothing to do with it but they should be able to give you a number for it. Call and ask for the concierge.)<br>  That included everything needed accept drinks and food, which we easily purchased and brought with us.<br>  So there we were, the four of us having probably the best time in our lives. The Sea of Cortez (this was on April 25th) was like glass. He took us more than 30 miles into the sea (I know because you couldn't see the mainland and I checked his chartplotter. My friend and I own sailboats)). Along the way, we had schools of dolphins we video taped, sea turtles, etc. I still have the picture of my young, beautiful wife sitting in the beg fishing chair with a drink in one hand and a cigar in the other. They played Bob Marley CD's , also.<br>  The captain sat high on the fly bridge while the crew member rigged all the poles. When we hooked a fish, we took turns to be sure everyone had a chance at landing a fish that day.<br>  We ended up with four huge dorados and releasing several others. My friend had his and mine stuffed and we received it in December that year from a taxidermist in Salt Lake City, of all places.<br>  We had a great time. The price should be under $500 for something like that now so if you need more info, let me know, as I may have the name of the place or phone number on a photo we took where we hung our big fish up when we returned late that afternoon.<br>  Two of the fish we left for mounting, the other two we gave to the  Captain and crewmember for their family and friends.<br>  We could have fillets from one and had a restaurant cook them for us but decided against it at the time. <br>  I want to say it was around a 26' sport fishing boat, quite comfortable, seaworthy and totally equipped. The captain was really great as was the friendly crew member. We tipped them, also, when we returned.<br>  That's a great gift idea for any guy... Just have the two of you go out....|`|AA10042296	Aries Fleet - Sport Fishing in Mazatlan,  Watch the video below.
eDjiOWKtaa	the best thing about Boracay is the fine sand. it just feels right when walking on the shore... and there's just too many activities to do aside from the usual swimming and sun bathing. the night life is pretty vibrant because all the clubs and bars are all on the shoreline.<br>  <br>  it's also the best place to get wasted and not be ashamed of it. since it's crowded, chances are the singles are looking to hook up with someone... for the ones going as a couple, doing it on an island paradise is as romantic as it gets.|`|exWZsVuFaa	How is Boracay different? <br>  Its waters are contaminated by improperly designed septic tanks, which has slowly seeped into the island. It is crowded. The resorts have encroached into its sandy beaches, which used to be long and wide. It is now full of escort service girls with their foreigner clients . . .  It was a beautiful place 15-20 years ago --- it is now over commercialized and people go there because it is what everyone else is doing.<br>  <br>  You're better off going to Bantayan Island or Malapascua Island in Cebu, or the Pearl Farm Resort in Davao.|`|sJqNDYVkaa	I haven't been to Boracay but I've heard so much about it.  Tourists are inclined to visit a certain place because they have heard so many good things about it.  They want to see for themselves what the fuss is all about.  And apparently, Boracay Beach has exceeded everyone's expectations thus it is a very popular tourist destination.|`|OmHC6d3Jaa	Boracay is the only top 10 beach in the entire world where its inhabitant's raw sewage continues to be dumped within line-of-sight of its for the moment pristine beaches.|`|8Xf1RJFAaa	its a paradise! what more is there to say.|`|rVUvopaLaa	the main difference is only in Boracay you can find locals are making "sandcastles" and solicit money from tourist.  <br>  <br>  they have a palengke/talipapa <br>  <br>  so many tambays in fact there are times the tambays outnumbers the tourist <br>  <br>  at night prostitutes outnumbers genuine gal toursit hanging out at the bar/pad<br>  <br>  congested and crowded<br>  <br>  personally i like Boracay back in the 80s until mid 90s.
5VD9fVa1aa	There is a movie theatre at the corner of Metcalfe and Ste-Catherine, three blocks west of the Centre Eaton.<br>  <br>  There is a laser tag game five blocks west of Centre Eaton, near the corner of Drummond and Ste-Catherine.<br>  <br>  There is a swimming pool at the YMCA at 1440 Stanley Street, which is four blocks west of the Centre Eaton.  There are lots of public pools in Montreal, but they are not downtown, but in residential areas.  There is also the swimming pool at the Montreal Olympic Park, but that is not dowtown either.  It is at  Pie IX metro.  There are all sorts of interesting things to do at the Olympic Park, including the Biodome, the Botanical Gardens,  and the Insectarium.|`|RMppfinbaa	Ok, so Montreal is a big Island but I'm asuming your coming to downtown mtl. Ok, so the BEST hotel to go to & which is also our pride and joy is l'Hotel de ville. Getting a fancy well-known name in the city could be pricy but if you're arriving at the montreal P.E-T airport ( which you probably are since its the only airport :P) you should definetly stay at the Hilton and take a taxi to clubs and what not. Crazy clubs that are hot right now are: 1234 is THE Place to be every friday night!!! no joke... Krush nightclub is also pretty cool too. Shopping would defintely be St-Catherines street (montreals version of Main street NY) and the Eaton Center. Check out out Olympic stadium, China Town, Little Italy and the Old port ( which is truly romantic at night). As for fun, definetly go to La Ronde. A crazy amusment park with wicked rides. A classic thing to try would be our Queue de Castor ( its not actually a beaver's tale its a dessert :P) Be careful about spending downtown because it can be more expensive then its work. AND, if you're here in the summer, go check out les Feux D'Artifices International du Quebec situated at LaRonde. Its like, an international firework competion with moving fireworks that look like people, etc etc. Truly amazing. And if you want to explore the great outdoors, go to Mont Tremblant and take a tram over the mountain and go shopping in the village for the day.<br>  It depends what type of thing you'd rather do. Like, if you'd rather bars/Irish Pubs/more English/more students/more casual, then Crescent Street is more the place to be. If you are looking for more Clubs, fancier/dressier, more french, then St Laurent is more the area you want. This is just me but I would definitely stay around the Crescent Street area, and then if you wanted to go out to a club on St Laurent you could still just take a cab back and only be, like, 10 bucks. But Crescent offers more in my opinion since you can walk from there down St Catherine and be right in the middle of good shopping, near Ogilvies, the Eaton's Centre, Complex Les Ailes, and all those big stores. You've gotta at least visit and walk around St Laurent though. There are a lot of really cool smaller fashion shops and funkier places.<br>  Some things you could also check out, Old Montreal/Old Port, China Town, BioDome (indoor zoo-type thing with habitats/climates), St Joseph's Oratory, etc.<br>  Fun bars (I tried to make a varied list depending on your interests): Brutopia, MadHatters, McKibbon's Irish Pub (All around the Crescent area, more casual, lots of university students), Foufounes Electriques (metal/punk/hardcore bar on St Catherine/St Laurent), GoGo Lounge (nicer, mod design, plays a lot of oldies dance music, 21+ age limit). That's all I can think of at the moment!<br>  Anyways, Hope that helps!

f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	The City is very compact and many folks walk.  Many people [myself included] don't own autos and use public transportation for longer trips.  <br>  <br>  SF even has a large contingent of people who walk to and from work because they live close enough that walking is as quick as taking public transportation.<br>  <br>  In addition, the weather allows for walking year round.|`|YupMCYHlaa	They walk more there than in suburbs.  In fact, even if you use your car you do quite a bit of walking because you often have to park several blocks away from where you're going.  If you live downtown or in a business district you do more walking because you can walk to shops and restaurants.  And there are lots of parks and paths and trails with wonderful views, along the ocean, by the marina, etc.   I walk for exercise, several miles a day, and sometimes I will go to San Francisco just to walk.<br>  <br>  They also have a good public transportation system.  Well, by American standards its very good.  If you live and work in San Francisco you don't need a car, in fact in some neighborhoods it's better to take public transportation because you can never count on getting a parking space, sometimes even the big multi-story garages are full.  But I think compared to other cities of similar size around the world, the public transit system is not that good, and people don't walk as much.|`|lPZudPkUaa	A lot! Bicycles are also popular.<br>  <br>  FYI, San Francisco is only 7 miles across! You could easily walk across the whole city in a day! Amazing to me (from NYC, which is huge).<br>  <br>  As others mentioned, good weather, bad parking and extensive public transportation all encourage people to leave the car home.|`|vLp1Y1aIaa	How much they walk and how that compares to anywhere else gets a shoulder shrug from me, but I do know that people that live in SF do tend to walk a lot as in many instances, things are close to get to and walking is more convenient.

And, most airports have restrictions on how many ounces liquids in your carryon/ hand luggage may be. Also- most airports have a policy that all liquids must be in a plastic baggie. **Visit your airlines website for their policys, because they varry!

Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>  Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>  From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Health Care Crisis.<br>  Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Very High Taxes.<br>  Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Money Hungry Government.<br>  Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. No Culture.<br>  Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Worst Weather.<br>  Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. No Jobs.<br>  Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future.

It really doesn't seem like it would agree well with you.  <br>  <br>  There really isn't a big (but not too big) city.  Honolulu's population is about 400,000.  The next most populated city, Hilo, rings in at 40,000.  There's a fantastic boarding school on The Big Island (home of Hilo) called Hawaii Preparatory Academy, but it's quite a ways from Hilo.  <br>  <br>  Big sports team?

The Cork train leaves from Heuston Station.<br>  <br>  Trains to the cities of Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Kilkenny also leave from Heuston station, and journey times are no more than 3 hours for each city. For more information, visit www.irishrail.ie.<br>  <br>  One thing you might find useful to know: Ireland doesn't really do cities. If you've just been to mainland Europe and seen the cities there, Irish cities are going to seem very parochial in comparison. Ireland's great strength in terms of tourism is the countryside, which unfortunately is not that easily reached via public transport, your best bet would be to hire a car for a couple of days. But as you only have 5 days, you would be as well just to do day trips to the other places.|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Well the main cities are Dublin, Cork, Galway and Belfast.<br>  From Dublin driving it usually takes 6 hours from Dublin because of the traffic, but it's 3 hours on the train.

You should visit Galway though it's the Bohemian capital of Ireland.<br>  Cork is a lot like Dublin and so is Belfast so you mightn't want to bother with them, I wouldn't anyway.|`|A3fYo8eYaa	Well you can get the train station to a lot of places.

With regards to an earlier post to this question:  water is not an issue as their is high quality bottled water available and most safari companies you book with provide it on their trips.  With regards to Malaria this is really only an issue on the coast and at lower elevations and is easily prevented with medication that can be purchased for about 5$ in Kenya and any safari company you book with can make recommendations.  I have been many times and often do not take any malaria medication and have never had a problem.<br>  Highlights of Kenya:  National Parks and Reserves-Masai Mara, Amboseli, Tsavo, Meru, Samburu, the lakes region (naivasha, nakuru, etc), the coast region Lamu, Mombasa, Malindi/Watamu.

I doubt they do and think that most airlines will just have the TV monitors above your head.  Most airlines will operate the 757 on flights to the Hawaiian islands and usually those aircraft are not fitted with the personal TV.  I think the airlines are concentrating more on putting the personal TV on aircraft that fly to Europe.  Maybe you can bring a portable DVD player.  Also know that Hawaii is around 4 hours behind you so if you can sleep on that flight, you will arrive more refreshed.|`|Mok3ewI2aa	If you know the Airline and Plane Model you can go to seatguru.com and it will tell you - I do it all the time.|`|wyNVJXUiaa	JetBlue, Virgin America all have such features in the coach section.

46fouwFfaa	I'm in the same situation. Yeah, my relatives don't usually make fun of me since they think I don't even know how to speak Somali to begin with but my parents make fun of my Somali a lot. D: <br>  <br>  There are a lot of Somalis in the UK, is there a Somali community centre where you live? If so, see if they offer Somali language classes. It might be embarrassing if there are a lot of Somalis in the class but the only way you can improve is by practising. Get your parents to only speak Somali to you and try to only reply back in Somali. If you make a mistake, they should correct you and if you don't understand a word or how to conjugate a verb or something, ask them. My friend did this for about 3 years and now she's fluent. I'm not fluent yet but I've improved a lot. It's hard to start speaking back in only Somali but after a while, it gets easier.<br>  <br>  I know that some Somalis in the UK have satellite and watch Somali news. Try that. A lot of people learn languages by watching television (seriously). If you can, try to go to Somalia or Djibouti in the summer. Some areas are safe just don't go to Mogadishu. My cousins did this and their Somali also improved.|`|4c6549fd1fc3d819643c24a127555d36aa	Volunteer for a Somali-British organization that helps local Somalis adapt to their new home (the U.K.). In the U.S., we have a few of these organizations aimed at helping many different kinds of people. They include tutoring, helping people shop for groceries, practicing language skills, etc. Just helping them adapt.<br>  <br>  By having contact with them, I'm sure your Somali will improve.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, one thing I would not recommend is going to Somalia to live :(
qXvFsnOcaa	Yes, constantly, and because America has so many different accents the British do it a lot more.<br>  <br>  People mostly used to make fun the slower accents like the Southern accent, but since GW became president they most make fun his "cowboy" style, in Britain it's considered to be indicative of a low intellect to have that kind of accent. They also often make fun of the redneck/hillbilly accents, too, for the same reason. Making fun of the Midwestern accents is also common.<br>  <br>  Ironically, the accent that most Americans think of as being British is not really a British accent. It's a fake accent made out of a combination of the Queen's English accent found wealthy parts of southern England and a generic American accent. It was made up to make British actors sound more appealing to American audiences for the movies and by American actors who couldn't act a proper British accent. People like Hue Grant use it for films, but it's not really used at all in Britain.|`|kVeu3nfwaa	No, if they speak like an American they have enough problems already without us making fun of them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Note for those with a complete lack of understanding of the British sense of humour (e.g. Americans): That was a Yes.|`|eJ9DrMr5aa	Being an American living in England, people don't really make fun of the accent.

I think.|`|ufnSqRiqaa	As an American living there I had some people tease me in a friendly way about it.  You just have to have a good sense of humor about it.    Some people just LOVED my accent.  The British are more mean-spirited about other British accents then they are about the American accent.  Meilien was entirely correct in that they love to make fun of the southern or hillbilly accent the most.  One of my favorite experiences there was listening to Brits tell Hillbilly jokes.  It is so funny to listen to them switch from British to Hillbilly.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	Oh yeah, so do the Irish, Scots and Aussies.|`|pYe3kkgNaa	No, not really.<br>  <br>  I can't speak for everyone, but i've never heard anyone make fun of it.

0pM85b5Baa	As a man I say love not always means kisses or hugs or even words of love. Specially these days when people find it easier to lie. <br>  <br>  No way to protect yourself from love mistakes as long as you are in love already. There is a way to protect yourself from love weakness, use more logic  and don't depend on feelings and emotions. Don't judge your partner with what you wish, reality is different than our dreams. Don't believe something related to feelings while you don't have a real sign that can't be used to deceive. After all think about your partner is still human and he may make mistakes even if he didn't want to. <br>  <br>  Last and not the least try to make your heart a {wise Heart}|`|0lmzc0gfaa	good thing we are all built in with internal instincts that's what you got to listen to your instincts when you find the rite one you will know what to do and when to do it.  you will get into a moment without fear or wonder when the moment comes you will just know.

However, kisses and hugs remains one of the main things to show affection and love.<br>  You are the only person who can judge that a guy is good or not. Because this guy can be bad for you but good for some one else or vice versa. Anyway, I belive that a good guy should be careful not to hurt your feelings, care for you, not to insult you, show affection (within limits) to you ....etc.<br>  Just follow your feelings to say if this person is good or not, but do not rush your judgement, take your time to see if he wants to take advantage from you or if he really care and love you. It is all about YOUR judgment. Good luck.|`|9R8uYHcPaa	it's normal to hug and kiss the one you love ...<br>  <br>  @bloodymary : i love thyme !!! =p

No evacuations unless the area has been subject to a major disaster, but people are warned to move to higher ground if tsunami are predicted.<br>  As for earthquakes, I suggest you google 'The Great Hanshin earthquake', that was the biggest quake in Japan for many years.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons are the major ones.  They rarely have tornadoes.   Also, they have sand storms coming from China every year.  <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|VYCLwKwNaa	Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, typhoons, mudslides, blizzards, floods, <br>  Tokyo and other cities have evacuation plans. A major earthquake is expected to occur on the fault that runs through the Inland Sea by Shikoku Island. You can read all about it in English on the web. One site is that run by the Japanese Meterological Agency. Many Japanese cities have evacuation and earthquake plans on their web sites, which often have an English version. Also, there are signs along the streets in areas such as Tokyo's Shinjuku (where there are a lot of tall glass-sided buildings) directing people to nearby parks in the event of earthquakes.<br>  Tokyo is a VERY large city, I think the largest in the world. The chaos of evacuating the entire population, in the event of either a predicted earthquake or any other natural disaster or fire following a disaster, would be a logistical nightmare. It would make a great scenario for a novel, but I wouldn't want to experience it in reality. Even with arguably the world's best mass transportation system, any interruption of power, loss of bridges, blockage of main roads, collapse of elevated highways, and things would grind to a halt.<br>  That said, I feel very safe in Tokyo and adore Japan.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	i'm pretty sure the word tsunami is japanese!

Up north in hokaiko you can get blizzards too.  Major cities won't evacuate unless Mt Fuji decides to erupt.  But then again I'm not even sure it would be safe to be in Japan if it ever were to...<br>  <br>  During summers it doesn't stop raining, it's pretty boring and that increases the chance of flooding, especially in metropolitan areas like Tokyo...|`|0zPNP2jjaa	tsunamis|`|9bWCggMgaa	earth quakes!!!!!!!<br>  it's the only one which frequently happens.

Jm3vMKx3aa	My niece and her husband have traveled several times to the Maldives and they've always liked it because their hobby is scuba diving and the Maldives have offered excellent diving resorts. They have however also reported about especially younger couples who were bored and disappointed not sharing that hobby and being "deported" to an atoll or island of just a few square miles which takes less than an hour to walk around it on the beach.<br>  The Maldive Government also strictly separates the territory by tourist and citizens islands and visits are limited to guided tours. So be advised to check carefully whether you'll chose this destination.<br>  My nice and her husband have been there 20 years ago for the first time and getting bored they have chosen a scuba diving course which was offered on that particular island. They have never regretted to have booked that journey since without it they would probably never have gotten into scuba diving; an experience they would not want to have missed until today.<br>  By the way a passport is needed to travel and a 30-day tourist visa will be issued free of charge at Male airport before continuing to your final destination by boat or seaplane. <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_961.html#entry_requirements" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw...</a>

aIZfiU6Kaa	If you want the best seats you have to fly with the best airline, if you want the cheapest airline you can't expect the best service, you get what you pay for, if you want to fly with a 'no frills' airline, that's what you get 'no frills', and you can't reserve seats Zippy.<br>  <br>  That said however, you can pay about ￡3 extra on line for priority boarding, so just get there early and do that and you will have no problem, first come first served, they will help your dad on if he needs help and you ask them but you still cannot guarantee the seat you want.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	Ask for pre boarding because your dad can't walk very well, you'll get on the plane before anyone else|`|AA12214864	Ryanair is the pits in terms of air travel!<br>  <br>  do you really want to travel with them, especially as they will soon start charging people to have a pee on the plane!<br>  <br>  I think there is a facility to pay in advance for the best seats on the plane.. this is how companies like Ryanair and Easy Jet make their money on these flights. <br>  <br>  if your father needs more room then I suggest you ring Ryanair up and find out how to reserve those seats.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Get there early and be at the front of the line.  Or you could mention to the flight attendant that your dad will require assistance in boarding; they usually let those people board first.|`|459f3e221cf02dc2127bf3273665bfb4aa	Ryanair now do priority boarding in the same way that easyjet do.  You pay a little extra but it means you can board before everyone else and so have a higher chance of sitting in an extra legroom seat.  The problem that you have if you say your dad has bad knees is they won't let him sit in an emergency exit seat - basically the only ones that are extra legroom seats as you have to be able-bodied to sit in them and the minute you mention anything that they remotely consider would make him a little slower to move they won't allow him to sit in the seat.<br>  <br>  I think you can purchase priority boarding online if not you can buy it at the airport before you fly.  It doesn't guarantee a better seat but it does give you a much better chance of getting one.  Plus make sure you are at the gate nice and early.

lcj1AKt1aa	You do not have anything to worry about. I can not remember if there were many hurricanes in October. If a hurricane is approaching the island that the ship suppose to visit, the captain WILL divert the ship to another island. I have never heard about any ships getting caught or damage in hurricanes before.  Tell him that he is worrying unnecessary and to come and enjoy himself.|`|3OPxgu0qaa	You should be fine.  I go in the end of August, which is the worst time to go, and we've never had a problem.  The ships monitor the storms and make changes if they need to.  You still get your vacation.  When I went this past summer we went to the same ports but out of order, not to avoid the storm but to avoid the crowds because other ships had to change their destinations.|`|UO2yyZneaa	We have taken four cruises during the hurricane season and never had a problem, in part because the ship steered around bad weather and partly because the odds of running into one are low.<br>  <br>  The Caribbean averages 12 to 15 tropical storms each year, and last year five became hurricanes.<br>  <br>  During October last year, there were five tropical storms and none became hurricanes.<br>  <br>  Your odds are pretty good.|`|8NZC6LsRaa	It will be safe. Yes, October is still hurricane season, but the ship will totally bypass it and the only thing that might tell you there's a hurricane is rougher water or maybe some rain. When Hurricane Katrina went through Ft. Lauderdale, our captain was able to reroute the ship to Tampa, and the only thing we experienced was real windy conditions upon arriving, but really nothing more. Little did we know what kind of destruction Hurricane Katrina would wreck on the Gulf Coast and New Orleans in particular!!!
AA10478980	I really don't think it will be worse than it is now, which is the height of the tourist season here in Key West.

Y5IUse1vaa	If you enjoy doing things as a family, it's great. Some folk think it's pricey but they are the ones looking for a holiday where you are waited upon, hand and foot. It's a great thing to be able to enjoy the company of your family and have the freedom to do what you want to. The main complex gives you the chance to relax, have a bite to eat, take a swim, or pick out some shopping to cook in your own wee house. The whole thing can be as good as you let it be.  Remember that if you choose to eat in the complex, it will probably be similar to eating out anywhere else in the UK.  I suggest that you make your own dinners a few times and have a treat in the complex on other nights. Good luck...|`|a1esFJ53aa	AMAZING! <br>  <br>  The accomodation is lovely!

gPE0wRTGaa	I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency and I really liked it. The lobby isn't anything to write home about, but it's definitely nice. Once you're in where all of the rooms are the hotel has cool, modernish architecture. I would try to describe how it looks but it's kind of hard. The rooms are quite comfortable, clean and nicely decorated and the staff is very friendly. It was conveniently located in the center of Boston too. The Intercontinental is pretty, but I didn't like staying there as much. The Marriot Longwharf is really nice and it's right along the water.

rSq790ksaa	Disney does a pretty good job to kick out non-resort members during EMH's. For EMH cast members don't give out bracelets anymore, they ask to see your room card to prove you're staying at one of their resorts. So it's completely possible they could ask to see it and then ask you to leave. However, when I went they only asked to see our rooms ID's before entering any ride or attraction and when we wanted to buy something in the parks.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	They aren't using the wristbands, they are checking your actual tickets, now.  But usually, you are correct, they just check them when you are trying to get on a ride.  So you might be able to do this.  But you never know when you might be asked for your ticket.  But the worst thing that could happen was that you would be told that it is past time and you need to leave.  So hey, if you can stay up that late, try it.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Tripadvisor.com is a free site for all the info you would ever need for Disney and travel.  The Orlando area of tripadvisor will have all your answers.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I do think the Worlds closes for EMH. You may not be able to get in to stores. I have seen them ask guests to leave.  But they are very nice about it. They do post cast members at all rides and attractions to check for the bands|`|72hMibsVaa	ONLY resort guest are allowed at EMH.  regardless of the park.  NO you can not stay there and walk around the park.   ONLY hotel guest are allowed back in.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	There are no more bands.  You can still shop (I'm not sure if you can eat at the sit-down restaurants) but you can't ride the rides.|`|9NSfJChaaa	You will be asked to show your "Key to the World" card which you receive when staying in a Disney resort.  You might be able to walk around, but you won't be able to enjoy any of the attractions.  My advise is to head on out once EMH starts unless you are back in the World Showcase and there is something to actually look at.  That's one of the perks to staying on site.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	I know I was at Epcot for EMH, but I am not 100% sure how it went.  I think if I am not mistaken they closed the World Showcase.<br>  You can only get to certain places.  Alot of the areas close at normal hours even for people who stay at the Disney Hotels.

9f5169159afb1c45757aaedd7e065b7caa	Yes, that is plenty of money to last a while.  I live in Irving which is on the west side of Dallas.  I pay $700 for a two bedroom, one bath apartment with washer/dryer and covered parking.  You can eat at one of the local diners with a good meal for about $9.00.  Gas is $1.79 per gallon.  Electricity last month for me was $129, but I ran the furnace a lot as it was cold.  Phone bill was $75 which includes $20 for Internet.<br>  <br>  Our job market here is excellent.  In fact, of all the jobs created in the U.S. last year, 80% of them were created in the great state of Texas.  Our economy is ranked number one in the U.S.  I think Dallas has the best of everything.  We have the largest Arts and Entertainment District in the nation with museums, symphony orchestra, sports, educational, and entertainment areas.  Don't know what kind of employment you are looking for, but don't think you would have a problem finding it.  <br>  <br>  Welcome to Texas.  You'll enjoy it.  <br>  <br>  Oh, one more thing . . . our weather is kind of crazy.  And it does get hot in the summer.|`|04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	That is plenty of money.  I live in Oklahoma, but lived in the Dallas area for a while.  The cost of living is SO much cheaper here and in Texas than it is California.  What you pay for rent in Cali, you could have a huge home in OKC or Dallas. Good luck to you and welcome to the southwest!|`|pRxzPiSbaa	10k should be plenty, but the job market isn't too great these days. you may want to find employment first, then move to dallas. good luck!
Vlp50eEGaa	Try the Royal Benja Hotel Sukhumvit Soi 5..  My wife has stayed there a few times now for conferences and she loves the place.  Cost about 2,000 baht a night.  <a href="http://www.bangkok.com/royal-benja-hotel/#rates" rel="nofollow">http://www.bangkok.com/royal-benja-hotel...</a>|`|ZtPdNnIZaa	i've been there like 20 times. as it's cheap + short time to fly BKK fr HK. BKK is the most popular vacation city 4 HKnese. anyway, i wil vote 4 BKK shangri-la. it's the best i hv ever try. i'd tried many many 5 stars hotel b4 such as Gran Hyatt, Four Seasons, Peninsula, Inter-con... among them. i guess Shangri-la the best! their pool is the biggest among all thr above 5 stars. w/ a lovely river view.... 2 mins walk fr the skytrain. super yummy breakfast in their cafe. the 2nd best hotel i'll say = Centara Grand in Centrfal World. <br>    <a href="http://www.centralhotelsresorts.com/cgcw/cgcw_default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.centralhotelsresorts.com/cgcw...</a><br>  <br>  it's the newest...most modern hotel located upstairs of a hugh shopping mall. the 2 biggest malls in BKK = Central World + Paragon is just rite downstairs.|`|bc2b27e6085c6f103858999045d052c1aa	Depends on your budget.  <br>  <br>  Try looking at www.asiarooms.com or www.sawadee.com they have comparable rates to Agoda.com.  I find Agoda.com overwhelming to comprehend.  <br>  <br>  High end:  Mandarin Oriental Hotel on the river.  Very nice, very expensive.   Sukhothai Hotel, Conrad Hotel, Plaza Athenee' Le Meridien Hotel<br>  <br>  Medium: Pathuwam Princess Hotel, this maybe ideal.  Right next to the mall, MBK Centre.  Lots of restaurants, lots of shopping within walking distance. <br>  <br>  I have only stayed at the Plaza Athenee' Le Meridien Hotel which was very nice, Emerald Hotel, Grand Mercure Fortune Hotel, Chao Phraya Park Hotel,  Palazzo Hotel and Amari Atrium Hotel. <br>  <br>  I have been in the Pathuwam Princess, its very nice and centrally located.  The Novotel Siam Square Hotel is a good hotel also<br>  <br>  There are not many less expensive hotels in the area this convenient.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|KXpxXPPFaa	.  The Key Hotel.  I stayed there not bad, inexpensive, professional and near the rail systems.  Great location to restaurants and markets.  Being near the rail system gives you option to go almost anywhere without getting into a taxi.|`|qUiQF8x3aa	Try some of the hotels in Suhkumvit Road.<br>  <br>  www.asiarooms.com/www.asiahotels.com|`|a8f3237efeb6d9baa2d939eac9a6f5b4aa	I was just there last week and can recommend a few great hotels! The Oriental Hotel is a world class hotel and well known for great hospitality and location right on the river.  I have not stayed there but seriously considered it until I heard there was construction during the time I wanted to go. (It may be done now, so still a great option.)  We stayed at the Marriott on the Thon Buri side (Tempe of The Dawn side) of the river. It is a great option is you would like a pool to relax in during the afternoon.  No other hotel has one on the river that I know of. It is really pretty and has a great concierge that is willing to jump at any need you might have. They also have a free shuttle to the main boat stop across the river. When coming back on the shuttle boat in the evening they even offer you a wet towel to clean off with. It was the best perk after a long sweaty day in the city.  (Most attractions/things to do are located on "the other side" of the river.)  There is also the Lebua State Tower, one of the tallest if not the tallest building on the area with 64 floors. The bar and restaurant on top has the MOST amazing views and is a MUST to visit if you are not going to stay there. They have  astrict dress code though, which we didn't originally know when we stopped by one night. (Trendy Dress Code).  The pollution in the city is AWFUL so I would suggest the Marriott if you want something nice and a tad further away from the black smoke and vehicle exhaust.  I had a ton of fun and deffinitley enjoyed the Marriott. Hope this helps!<br>  P.S. I noticed you visited Kao San road. This was my least favorite of shopping experiences in Bangkok, try the Lumpini Night Bazar, much more civilized and it's at night so much cooler.  If you want more authenic gear, get off at boat stop "nine" where you can shop local fare at a MUCH lower price.    :-)
12VQ4ETcaa	It doesn't appear in the TSA prohibited items list.  You wouldn't be able to smoke it on the plane or in the airport, but it looks like it's okay to bring it.  If I were you I would leave it in the original packaging so it doesn't look suspicious.|`|vITZgKthaa	it depends were your going to take your tobacco bags in a  carry-on luggage over the overhead bins..<br>  you can't fit much there and if you take to much you can pay for overweight luggage|`|eulMjLtPaa	There are no restrictions on tobacco unless you are under 18.<br>  <br>  However, be prepared to have an additional search of your bag while they examine the "leafy substance."
l4pVsxoraa	Probably a three to four day trip if you're not planning on stops for sightseeing along the way.   Head N/E from SW Florida and pick up I-95 all the way to Massachusetts, take I-91 North at New Haven and just stay on it all the way to the Canadian Border.   It's about 1800 miles each way. <br>  <br>  Somebody said a lot of people drive it in the opposite direction all the time.  True.  They also go home again.  Duh.|`|Twzg9s0caa	I don't think so.<br>  Lots of seniors do it when they stay down south for the winter because it would be too expensive to rent a car for like 3 months.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	A lot of people do it the other way<br>  A great drive, go up the coast one way, and inland on the return<br>  <br>  1754 miles, what are you driving|`|Oubfqir7aa	Of all things crazy I rank it a 2<br>  Might cost a hefty amount though
