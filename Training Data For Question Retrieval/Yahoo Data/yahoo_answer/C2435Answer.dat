Legally speaking...|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Try reading something similar to Twilight, along the same lines... make your obsession for one small thing grow to the whole genre, and from that genre, specific plots.  That way, you'll be reading many different books, and your imagination will be thriving- Twilight isn't the best book out there.  I guarantee you can find a better vampire romance out there, you just have to look.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	call a therapist(lol, jk), put the books away for while, try reading some other teen books that might interest you, maybe something similiar to twilight and then go from there. go outside, breathe, make out with some real guy instead of fantasizing of kissing edward, do something else. don't waste your teen years obsessed with some books that you're probably gonna leave behind when something else is "in"|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Three words: Get a life. Go to a party, make out with a REAL boy. Have fun in life.|`|km1vuLUzaa	haha join the club<br>  i do nothing else on my daily basis besides twilight-related things<br>  m very pathetic|`|nwlV4rMcaa	I'm half in the same situation I don't find any other books the same after twilight.<br>  Don't worry most people feel that way but I still manage to read books the arn't twilight.<br>  Just read for the fun of it and don't let anything else stop you|`|HwlBgOEraa	You should read twilight fan-fiction so you can can read something fresh instead of being so repetitive.|`|V3Z0Lvidaa	go to barnes and nobles or some bookstore and look at the books to see what's interesting and what's not.|`|GkfOXfdmaa	USE THE SEARCH BAR!!!!
yTquTHUPaa	Wow, that's very good. Lots of description and your opening leaves lots of possibilities.. Great potential! It leaves the reader wanting to read on, which is good! ^_^|`|rh5vbol9aa	We are facing a new-author!|`|4BvFnxTyaa	It's great that the story line just came to you. Like dreams; they give you ideas and mail them straight to your imagination so the jungle will keep on growing. You're very descriptive within even the first sentence, and give a lot of feeling! The protagonist is afraid, but can't tell her. Questions like, "Why is the main character so chilled to not even face 'the Room'?" race in my mind.|`|OVA2MsXRaa	It was really good with alot of potental for really good sybolism, and a great story line!!!!<br>  Good job it sounds great!!!!!!|`|tKMrzW9Caa	It's great so far! I love the descriptions, and it left me hanging a bit! Keep going!!!!|`|xrQQujHtaa	I liked it a lot very descriptive:]
STd3geMxaa	facing forward: usually done with guys, sometimes with girls. step in front of the male; depending on his height, you're rear will be against anywhere between his stomach and his pelvic region. If he makes a leadership sort of move (firmly grabs your waste, holds your hands, etc.) let him lead your hips and rock you where he wants. if he doesn't seem to know how to dance (grabs your waste gently, doesn't move, out of sinc with you) place his hands on your hips and rock from side to side. <br>  <br>  this is the basic motion: some fun tricks to try are figure 8's, and the slow circular motion (he will most likely get a *****). <br>  <br>  facing forward: usually used with girls or really hot guys. it should go her knee, your knee, her knee, your knee, and you're kind of interlocked. usually you hold hands or each other's hips. with guys hold either hips or shoulders (move down to hips if he holds your shoulders too-that's really awkward). you rock in whatever motion you want, side to side, figure 8, or circle. it's fun to get as low as you possibly can (don't fall over, that's embarassing). good luck with your grinding skills.|`|AenRh1eRaa	rub your butt around the penis area|`|fZgwb1rqaa	keep it simple to begin with!<br>  <br>  think of making a figure 8 with your hips, you'll start to get the hang of it and be more comfortable trying new things.|`|cBvxv316aa	Alvin, I agree, that feels good.|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	u rub ur *** against there "pelvic" area lmao u rub it against their di*k orr vag and bend over and justt move ur hips and shltt|`|CxVjw6XDaa	Maybe watch a video on youtube
k03dYskYaa	"For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten." Ecclesiastes 9:5<br>  "All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in She′ol, the place to which you are going." Ecclesiastes 9:10|`|AA11564934	Dead is dead, the end.  There is no more you, all functions cease.<br>  <br>  No hopes, joys, fears, regrets, nothing.  All gone.<br>  It's not "sleep" it's just over.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	We lose our consciousness and become part of everything,the trees,plants,sea,everything.|`|r8rykCkGaa	The angel(s) will take you to heaven if you are a born again child of God.  Do you have your sins forgiven?  Read the book of John.|`|HRQjffv8aa	I dont know, if i did i wont be afraid of death. Alot of people are afraid of death because they dont know what'll happen.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	System is  down. Pl wait for the answer.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	They say death is a shift in energy, a return to home. Your soul is mass energy, all you feel, think, and know. When you die you are released from your physical body and all that you feel think and know still exists, very much like when you sleep. You still exist but you are not aware of your body. That's it. You will feel an overwhelming sense of love and they say you will meet all the ppl you knew in life, in their state of energy without a body. Basically it is better than earth coz there is no hate, no bills, and no worries. Like I said its the feeling you have in a dreamless sleep.|`|8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	One can not know without experiencing own death.<br>  <br>  However, a friend who had a near death experience, told me that he had felt as if in absolute darkness, absolutely weightless and absolutely thoughtless....... totally blank in all respects and time seemed to stand still.|`|zZY3JX30aa	What are YOUR personal beliefs on where you go? It really doesn't matter what anyone else chooses to believe about it, all that matters is what you choose to believe about it.|`|7jYkIGh1aa	If I tell u that Ive been wondering I wont lie to u! <br>  But I dont know! >.>"<br>  I think that those who were going to die...u know...those who were near to death may know!|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Nobody is alive to tell the tale.|`|oDLRZBDiaa	LMAO! You are asking the living this question.............wow.|`|rUzDSLIWaa	It's the same as living in the U.K but without lights.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	well there's only one way to find out...<br>  <br>  but that can wait now can it?|`|Eduyj1h5aa	No one can say for sure because there's never been recorded cases of people being dead for long periods of time to experience death and be risen again. It is this unknowing that has created religion. Only religions explain what comes after death and you just hav to believe what the say. That's called faith. How can you walk up to a grave and ask them "how's death? Scary?". The only thing we know about death is the science of it. Once you are dead, your brain no longer operates. You feel no pain, no sorrow, no happiness, nothing. Think of yourself being by yourself with no emotions or feelings lieing on the floor in a completely white room with nothing to do. It's the science analogy of being dead. Based off religion, you have a soul inside your body that leaves your body when you die and goes to a paradise or hell based on what you life was like. But no one knows for sure. It's a mystery asked for centuries.|`|ElTNcN2Uaa	you  know when you  play video games and just before you get into a dangerous situation, you save your game?<br>  <br>  Okay. It's like that in life too. except whatever is saving our games for us,  it's automatic.<br>  <br>  Everytime you  dream of driving off a cliff or dying, you ACTUALLY DO!! But your savegame kicks in and you  wake up in your bed, thinking that that's where you   were all the time.<br>  <br>  Except, you actually DID die.  <br>  <br>  We just come back here with no memory of actually dying.<br>  <br>  "No one gets out of here alive"...Jim Morrison|`|BS2dgOIWaa	I read that when you die your body releases endorphins so that you feel no pain, making the entire experience quite pleasant. <br>  <br>  If we all knew, do you think there would be so many different religions?<br>  <br>  Wouldn't we all just kind of look at each other and admit, "hey... it was the mormons who got it right."<br>  <br>  (Sorry, I just had to reference that episode of south park)|`|yudzhdU6aa	I had a near death experience (hypothermia induced) and quite frankly you just shut down. Yes there is a bit of the light thing going on but really I think it was just your senses going into over-drive trying to pull you back up. You can feel more, hear more, see more(hence the light), but really it's just a receding into shutdown. NO GOD!!! Sorry|`|MYedpoHcaa	seriously... i dont think anyone who has experienced it can really fill you in right now... why dont you use your imagination... or read a bible|`|QETSv98Haa	Hun you're never going to get the real answer to this question cause the only people that know the complete truth are dead.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Transition is a nicer word.  You go to sleep, when you wake up you have just shucked your earth suit and gone home as a spirit|`|YbSsCVRRaa	read the book 'the tibetan book of the dead.|`|sZpf9pvRaa	You will belong to the place where you deserved to be, through all your result on this Earth.|`|zCWnKavgaa	Lol trust me when the time comes you will know exactly what death is like...but for now enjoy life|`|McXwX0hEaa	ask Jesus Christ (there are five known people alive today named Jesus Christ)|`|TTRTTbt6aa	just see when you die...........
HKS2hRk8aa	just try it, it will all come back to yo you<br>  its like riding a bike
tpb7NMa0aa	Of course. Drama is a form of entertaining you, but it brings out your emotions. For example, if you watch a show like Grey's Anatomy, it may bring out your soft side. As for dance, it brings out emotions in people. If they see you dancing in a happy manner, they would clap and smile and eventually join in on the fun.|`|phDTu7c1aa	Not really. Dancing hasn't really affected me in my everyday life.|`|20BKec9aaa	It really depends, if we want to we could just randomly break into dance and stun everyone around with our amazing skill, you klnow like those guys in the happy dance commercials, I mean who wouldn't want to be able to break into dance randomly. As for drama if you wanted to ,ake someone feel bad you could act out the part, or even like that actor in India you could play dead when terrorists burst into a building hoping to kill westerners. See its good for something however medial and utterly little.

3ZrTiVFCaa	Because they are Good Allies<br>  When Britain in Trouble Usa Help Them<br>  When Usa In Trouble Britain Helps Them|`|GaHkxtU9aa	The U.S and Britain have mostly been allies when the status quo has been threatened in International Relations. For example, Britain and the U.S joined forces in both world wars when it was feared that one nation - Germany - would dominate Europe. The same was with the cold war - they joined together to stop Soviet aggression and domination in Europe.<br>  <br>  The U.S and Britain are successful economically in times of peace and stability. So they join together to ensure that the balance of power is maintained, and that their is regional stability where their interests are concerned.|`|AenRh1eRaa	Britain has a long history for being a leader in war. As wars become more advance, Britain cannot sustain itself any longer while keeping their troops well equipped. They fare pretty damn well if they were just governing themselves, but because of national pride they have to be with the big dog USA. <br>  <br>  Also by aiding USA, they save money i.e ( having access to greater war tech by having USA's back, look up anti-ballistic missile tech)|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	They didn't "have to join in," but they felt it was the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Terrorism is more of real of a threat to Britain than it is to the U.S.  The IRA have been bombing targets in the UK for decades.  Not all movements toward independence have been as peaceful as India's; with an empire that once circled the globe, the UK still has a big hand in foreign diplomacy.  <br>  <br>  Bin Lad din and his terrorist attacked the very heart of capitalism by destroying the WTC.  It wasn't an attack against religions, or indecency, or even democracy (otherwise, they would have hit the Capitol Building first instead of the WTC).  What the terrorists were after was economic instability. They attacked the free market economy.  Britain understood what that meant and decided to throw their lot in with their biggest ally.|`|PJ4kq7Nzaa	learned this from world and us history. its just Britain is r number 1 Alie its 4 example. if your best friend is getting beaten up would u help her, i know u would, its like that.|`|RIw8iITtaa	The US and the UK are in a organization along with other countries called NATO.

Om7OhWRUaa	The theistic existentialist recognizes the spiritual crisis of modernity (the existentialist question) and feels that the transcendence of God can resolve the crisis (the theistic answer).<br>  <br>  I highly recommend reading Kierkegaard, especially "Either/Or".|`|ngxw9waWaa	I have learnt labels and tags are identities an individual wears or is assigned until he transcends all such limitations and constraints of perception.  Whilst society requires knowing a person’s character, beliefs, attributes and background, labels are something to be coveted, acquired and surpassed, until the intellect matures sufficiently to shed all such worldly mantles and join the league of free worldly universal thinkers. <br>  <br>  There is a need, given the remiss of such high minded philosophers, great minds and trustworthy wise mentors in the political, media or social arena to form such a fraternity, a cult towards the establishment of the rule of noble Lordship. Quaint old terminology causes refraction for the sake of diversity for diversity’s sake than to broaden the collective conscious and bring peace.<br>  <br>  Theism is an allegory of the given doctrines and disciplines of scriptures. They too were motivated to place quill upon parchment, scalpel to rock to preserve for posterity a message of truth and understanding. Theism becomes daily truth by the interpretation of a communicator able to not only recite ad verbatim the scriptures but assign these truths and pearls of wisdom to modern day daily usage. Bringing the sacred truths and tenets to life as it were as living truths as the eternal and enduring word.<br>  <br>  An abridgment of understanding between the ancient and the current social phase is not so insurmountable a task and nor is it easy. The divisions lie not in the teachings as such, truth is truth no matter what language or degree of articulation is applied, but the associated and affiliated factors attached to those scriptures demanding subservience to their agenda and cause in lieu of the treasure of their gems being used for enlightenment purposes, not an entirely insurmountable dilemma. <br>  <br>  A perspective, and the main reason why the many religions are at loggerheads with scientists and philosophers. Truth morphs with life, theism and existentialsm are two paths of truth, both unique in their terminology and quintessential delivery of the underlying principles of philosophy or the quest for absolute quantum understanding...|`|zZY3JX30aa	They'd say, "Nice sweater, is it new?" or "Way to go on your latest philosophy"|`|MB1oT04maa	....what was the question again...?|`|1NuKii8qaa	The meaning of life lies in the fact of living. That's what I remember of the essence of existentialism. Death is a completely different issue, because, whatever we believe or not, it is often unacceptable to consider it as a mere mindless nothingness. That's why I think that a philosophy of life is not directly connected with a philosophy of death and its consequences, and that religions or theism's are indeed nourished by this inverse source: the end of life.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	Funny. This was the only chapter out of the whole book "Existentialism for Dummies" that I deliberately skipped over. I didn't get a chance to go back and read it like I had planned. It was about Kierkegaard and theistic existentialism.|`|3047dd6618622823b544c55daf1b8a58aa	They were just Atheists in denial!
fb468012b8cf897d2de025f26607747faa	Absolutism only deals in absolutes- black and white. There is no shade of gray. You have either done something virtuous or committed a heinous atrocity. Relativism looks at the circumstances behind moral belief and then makes an assessment based on whether the action was right according to that set of ideas. So, a Christian would deem suicide a sin, while a Samurai might consider it honorable. Things of that nature.|`|AA12226718	Moral absolutism is when you're moral absolutely all of the time.<br>  Moral relativism is when you're only moral with your relatives.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Unfortunately the questioner already knows the answer|`|MB1oT04maa	morality is a myth|`|4854FMZjaa	Individuality<br>  <br>  People are frightened when they are told this. They will again and again ask you if they are not going to keep their individuality. What is "individuality"? I should like to see it. A baby boy has no moustache; when he grows to be a man, perhaps he has a moustache and beard. His individuality would be lost if it were in the body. If I lose one eye, or if I lose one of my hands, my individuality would be lost if it were in the body. A drunkard should not give up drinking because he would lose his individuality. A thief should not be a good man because he would thereby lose his individuality. No one ought to change their habits for fear of this. The truth is that there is no individuality except in the Infinite. That is the only condition that does not change. Everything else is in a constant state of flux. Neither can individuality be in memory. Suppose, on account of a blow on the head I forget all about my past; then, I have lost all individuality; I am gone. I do not remember two or three years of my childhood, and if memory and existence are one, then whatever I forget is gone. That part of my life which I do not remember, I did not live. That is a very narrow idea of individuality.<br>  We are not individuals yet. We are struggling towards individuality, and that is the Infinite, that is our real nature. Only the person whose life is in the whole universe really "lives." The more we concentrate our lives on limited things, the faster we go towards death. Those moments alone we live when our lives are in the universe, in others; and living this little life is death, simply death, and that is why the fear of death comes. The fear of death can only be conquered when we realize that so long as there is one life in this universe, we are living. When I can say, "I am in everything, in everybody, I am in all lives, I am the universe," then alone comes the state of fearlessness. To talk of immortality in constantly changing things is absurd. Says an old Sanskrit philosopher: It is only the Spirit that is the individual, because it is infinite. Infinity cannot be divided; infinity cannot be broken into pieces. It is the same one, undivided unit for ever, and this is the real individual, the Real Person. The apparent person is merely a struggle to express, or to manifest, this individuality that is beyond; and evolution is not in the Spirit. These changes that are going on--the wicked becoming good, the animal becoming human, take them in whatever way you like--are not in the Atman. They are the evolution of nature and manifestation of Atman. <br>  <br>  Suppose there is a screen hiding you from me, in which there is a small hole through which I can see some of the faces before me, just a few faces. Now suppose the hole begins to grow larger and larger, and as it does so, more and more of the scene before me reveals itself and when at last the whole screen has disappeared, I stand face to face with you all. You did not change at all in this case; it was the hole that was evolving, and you were gradually manifesting yourselves. So it is with the Atman. No perfection is going to be attained. You are already free and perfect. <br>  <br>  What are these ideas of religion and God and searching for the hereafter? Why do we look for a God? Why do we, in every nation, in every state of society, want a perfect ideal somewhere, either in human beings, or in God, or elsewhere? Because that idea is within us. It was our own heart beating and we did not know; we were mistaking it for something external. It is the God within our own self that is propelling us to seek for Him and to realize Him. After long searches here and there, in temples and in churches, in earths and in heavens, at last we come back, completing the circle from where we started, to our own soul and find that He for whom we have been seeking all over the world, for whom we have been weeping and praying in churches and temples, on whom we were looking as the mystery of all mysteries shrouded in the clouds, is nearest of the near, is our own Self, the reality of our life, body and mind. That is our own nature. Assert it, manifest it. Not to become pure, we are pure already. We are not to become perfect, we are that already. Nature is like the screen which is hiding the reality beyond. Every good thought that we think or act upon is simply tearing the veil, as it were; and the purity, the Infinity, the God behind, manifests Itself more and more.<br>  That Which Is "Inside" We See "Outside"<br>  <br>  Why do we see wickedness? There was a stump of a tree, and in the dark, a thief came that way and said, "That is a policeman." A young man waiting for his beloved saw it and thought that it was his sweetheart. A child who had been told ghost stories took it for a ghost and began to shriek. But all the time it was the stump of a tree. We see the world as we are. Suppose there is a baby in a room with a bag of gold on the table and a thief comes and steals the gold. Would the baby know it was stolen? That which we have inside, we see outside. The baby has no thief inside and sees no thief outside. So with all knowledge. Do not talk of the wickedness of the world and all its sins. Weep that you are bound to see wickedness yet. Weep that you are bound to see sin everywhere, and if you want to help the world, do not condemn it. Do not weaken it more. For what is sin and what is misery, and what are all these, but the results of weakness? The world is made weaker and weaker every day by such teachings. <br>  <br>  Men and women are taught from childhood that they are weak and sinners. Teach them that they are all glorious children of immortality, even those who are the weakest in manifestation. Let positive, strong, helpful thought enter into their brains from very childhood. Lay yourselves open to these thoughts, and not to weakening and paralyzing ones. Say to your own minds, "I am the Atman. I am the Infinite." Let it ring day and night in your minds like a song, and at the point of death declare, "I am the Atman." That is the Truth; the infinite strength of the world is yours. Drive out the superstition that has covered your minds. Let us be brave. Know the truth and practice the truth. The goal may be distant, but awake, arise, and stop not till the goal is reached.|`|yUudoO1Raa	Reality is an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an absolute and so is a human life. Whether you live or die is an absolute. Whether you have a piece of bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a looter’s stomach, is an absolute." Galt’s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 173. Ayn Rand<br>  <br>  That is an example of moral absolutism.<br>  This is moral relativism:<br>  <br>  "In the whirling Heraclitean flux which is the pragmatist’s universe, there are no absolutes. There are no facts, no fixed laws of logic, no certainty, no objectivity.<br>  <br>  "There are no facts, only provisional “hypotheses” which for the moment facilitate human action. There are no fixed laws of logic, only mutable “conventions,” without any basis in reality. (Aristotle’s logic, Dewey remarks, worked so well for earlier cultures that it is now overdue for a replacement.) There is no certainty—the very quest for it, says Dewey, is a fundamental aberration, a “perversion.” There is no objectivity—the object is created by the thought and action of the subject."

AA11586960	No FDR caused the Cold war by sneaky deals with Stalin  behind Churchill's Back <br>  <br>  Churchill warned FDR of Stalin's Aims In Europe|`|bdnMQnVHaa	After.|`|HxXduL1maa	The Western democracies and the Soviet Union discussed the progress of World War II and the nature of the postwar settlement at conferences in Tehran (1943), Yalta (February 1945), and Potsdam (July-August 1945). After the war, disputes between the Soviet Union and the Western democracies, particularly over the Soviet takeover of East European states, led Winston Churchill to warn in 1946 that an "iron curtain" was descending through the middle of Europe. For his part, Joseph Stalin deepened the estrangement between the United States and the Soviet Union when he asserted in 1946 that World War II was an unavoidable and inevitable consequence of "capitalist imperialism" and implied that such a war might reoccur. <br>  <br>  The Cold War was a period of East-West competition, tension, and conflict short of full-scale war, characterized by mutual perceptions of hostile intention between military-political alliances or blocs. There were real wars, sometimes called "proxy wars" because they were fought by Soviet allies rather than the USSR itself -- along with competition for influence in the Third World, and a major superpower arms race. <br>  <br>  According to Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs, in May 1962 he conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba as a means of countering an emerging lead of the United States in developing and deploying strategic missiles. He also presented the scheme as a means of protecting Cuba from another United States-sponsored invasion, such as the failed attempt at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. <br>  <br>  After obtaining Fidel Castro's approval, the Soviet Union worked quickly and secretly to build missile installations in Cuba. On October 16, President John Kennedy was shown reconnaissance photographs of Soviet missile installations under construction in Cuba. After seven days of guarded and intense debate in the United States administration, during which Soviet diplomats denied that installations for offensive missiles were being built in Cuba, President Kennedy, in a televised address on October 22, announced the discovery of the installations and proclaimed that any nuclear missile attack from Cuba would be regarded as an attack by the Soviet Union and would be responded to accordingly. He also imposed a naval quarantine on Cuba to prevent further Soviet shipments of offensive military weapons from arriving there. <br>  <br>  During the crisis, the two sides exchanged many letters and other communications, both formal and "back channel." Khrushchev sent letters to Kennedy on October 23 and 24 indicating the deterrent nature of the missiles in Cuba and the peaceful intentions of the Soviet Union. On October 26, Khrushchev sent Kennedy a long rambling letter seemingly proposing that the missile installations would be dismantled and personnel removed in exchange for United States assurances that it or its proxies would not invade Cuba. On October 27, another letter to Kennedy arrived from Khrushchev, suggesting that missile installations in Cuba would be dismantled if the United States dismantled its missile installations in Turkey. The American administration decided to ignore this second letter and to accept the offer outlined in the letter of October 26. Khrushchev then announced on October 28 that he would dismantle the installations and return them to the Soviet Union, expressing his trust that the United States would not invade Cuba. Further negotiations were held to implement the October 28 agreement, including a United States demand that Soviet light bombers also be removed from Cuba, and to specify the exact form and conditions of United States assurances not to invade Cuba.|`|Gmvldblraa	It was a consequence of the cold war - in fact a direct consequence of the stationing of missles by the USA in Turkey, very close to the USSR. The Russians backed down over putting their missiles in Cuba and the US quietly removed theirs from Turkey. Then both sides built bigger missiles so they didn't have to deploy them in client states. And the Cold War rolled on.

LZo6aSOCaa	Anything from Anne Rice is GREAT.<br>  Dark Lover by J.R. Ward is a really good book too, lots of characters though, and the plot can be slightly confusing for someone who isn't an advanced reader. <br>  Also, the author's name eludes me, but I remember reading an AMAZING book that a 13 year old girl wrote called "A Demon In My View", it's a small book, but it's part of a series, (A Demon In My View is actually the second one in it I believe.) and it's really well written.<br>  All of those are vampire books, so I hope that gives you something to read. Though, they are all a lot (Cough, dare I say better? Yes, I dare.) different from Stephanie Meyer's... concoctions... and don't expect your Twilight series from these guys.  They are a lot darker and more into it than S.M.  I will warn of Dark Lover's explicit tendencies. There are quite a few sexual scenes and the language is that of a typical teenagers... obnoxious.

FF9mMlgKaa	it is the belief that life has no real meaning (absurdity) and that therefore it is up to the individual to create meaning in life. This goes with the idea that there are no forces which have predetermined our destinies. There is a closely related approach called nihilism which states that there are no rules to accept given the absurdity of life and it advocates creating ones own ethical standards as well and supports life choices such as hedonism and suicide. Nihilism also believes the individual ultimately can't bring meaning to life.|`|AA10729675	You did not misspell it.  It is a philosophy that was in vogue after WW2, in Europe and especially in France.  This philosophy mainly says that your being (essence) comes after your existing (= actions).  In other words, you can always change your actions, you have a second chance (and many more chances).  However it has been often interpreted as a way to live a loose life and then one day, eventually, if one so desires, one can change and behave properly.  This, of course, was not in the mind of the philosophers.  I think they meant the exact opposite: you are responsible for your actions and your life.  You can always better yourself.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	"existentialists" don't really like to be classified as that, and are against all sorts of classifications and socially imposed meanings. However they do share some things in common with their philosophies, which is why we label them. Existentialism is concerned with finding meaning and value in life, in a meaningless world. That is one thing existentialists have in common, is they're against any sort of imposed meaning to live from any type of absolute system (science, rationality, religion, society). At first it may seem very sad and emo because you first have to realize that we live in a meaningless world. But once that is realized the existentialist goal is to create meaning for ourselves and give our own lives value. They believe this can be done. This is what separates existentialism from nihilism, which does not believe there is any meaning to life, and that there can't be, so any type of grasp or search for meaning is useless.|`|PFncnta2aa	Existentialism is a term that has been applied to the work of a number of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences[1][2], took the human subject — not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual[3][4] — and his conditions of existence as a starting point for philosophical thought. Existential philosophy is the explicit conceptual manifestation of an existential attitude[5] that begins with a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world[6][7]. Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience[8][9].|`|ABhmJepFaa	It's a name of a philosophy.

Vd1OzUO8aa	1.  Both countries were xenophobic and racist.  They both saw the native peoples of the New World as barbaric and wanted to enlighten them.  The Spanish were much more aggresive in their attempts to do so.  They wanted to totally dominate the native peoples.  The natives  had to become catholics or else death awaited them.  The English wanted to kind of put all the native people together so that they could then bring priests to them and slowly make them christians.  This is where the idea of the native reserves came from. <br>  <br>  The English also desired to build up an actual empire.  When they built up USA and Canada (for example) as sustainable colonies, this increased the worldwide power of England and made it more formidable.  At that time, many of the other countries were interested only in exploiting the new world and bring the wealth they found back to Europe.  This was how the Spanish operated in the beginning, but they eventually changed to the English style (as did all the European countries).<br>  There was little real assimilation with either country.  Both looked upon half-breeds as only a little better than native.  Both European powers ignored native power structures, cultures and societies.  They basically forced a new way of living on the people.<br>  <br>  2.  African slaves were brought over to replace the native peoples who were dying out in massive numbers.  They were dying by disease, starvation, depression and over-work.  The Spanish particularly forced the natives to be slaves, to work in the mines to mine gold and silver.  The Spanish also set up plantations in which slaves were needed to work.  These were brought over as well from Africa.  Of all the European powers, it was the Portuguese who introduced the most slaves to the New World.  They brought thousands of African slaves over to work in the plantations of Brazil.  Though the English treated the native peoples badly, basically taking their land bit by bit, they used them less as slaves.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps somewhat.

2Ko12Elfaa	Kid (your s/n, not the pejorative), I'm saying this because I want to help you.  You need to slow down.  I can tell from your writing style that you're making ideas that are technically simple much too complicated.<br>  <br>  One thing you point out that's worth talking about is the myth that reading is just reading.  There's bad reading, and there's good reading (i.e, passive reading and active reading).  With many texts, you need to use active reading to get a fuller understanding.  Anticipating information, checking your understanding and asking questions while reading, reflection-- all are some basic methods you can use to better understand a novel.  All that a literatue class really does is coach you at doing these things while you read for class.<br>  <br>  As for Ulysses... as I've suggested, I would not read this yet.  In short, it's an experimental, extremely eclectic novel that draws a lot from Joyce's Greek/Latin literary education.  Experience with stream of consciousness does help (although... what from Faulkner or Hemingway is written in stream of consciousness??), but probably there is much less to appreciate until you're versed in the Greeks and Romans.  What you're *specifically* asking for is readily available, though.  There are probably more annotated editions of Ulysses than regular editions (any decent library will have some).|`|SS9hE8rnaa	First of all, let me say I'm proud of the answers you've already received. Most are sincerely trying to help and have good ideas for you.<br>      A Handbook to Literature by Thrall and Hibbard helped me get through graduate school. It's now available on line.<br>       For God's sake, don't try to start with Ulysses. Read Portrait Of the Artist as a Young Man and understand every story fully. Perhaps then you should move on the The Dubliners. Portrait of the Artist also deals with Stephen Daedalus. Apply the techniques of close reading. Look up every word you don't understand. Look up some words you do understand to see what alternative meanings they may have. One of your responders recommended reading with a dictionary. I recommend reading with a pencil as well so that you can take notes.|`|lh0dihm1aa	This sounds like a homework assignment.<br>  What exactly do you want from this question? You say you want pointers, but do you want it on your writing? If so, there are a few punctuation errors. Another thing, you shouldn't title your work with a question and then jump right into answering it. You need a thesis statement which explains what you're addressing.|`|uin3ffWDaa	for the last five or so years i have been endeavoring to read as much classic literature as i can. i have learned some interesting things about my self and literature in general. first of for me it's all about an authors writing style. i read light in august and as i lay dying, it was like torture for me. i just don't like his style. but this being said light in august is a book i, to this day, ponder over. which is my second point some good books you read may not soak in immediately and may need a second read or further contemplation.  for me some of my favorites have been vonnegut, rand, orwell, tennyson, chekhov. also, read a lot of short stories, these give you an opportunity to experience an author's style and themes without committing to a novel.|`|el8yX5q3aa	You are like me.  I have a very difficult time reading and comprehending things unless they really do interest me.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://howtoimprovereadingcomprehension.com/" rel="nofollow">http://howtoimprovereadingcomprehension....</a><br>  <br>  these are the building blocks to improving your comprehension for reading anything.  It is similar to what a tutor taught me during my college years.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	I'm a literature major, and I've been where you are! <br>  <br>  First rule, for every reader out there; KEEP A DICTIONARY WITH YOU WHEN YOU READ!!! Look up every word you don't understand, and never assume you've correctly figured out the meaning of a new word by the way it's used. Your vocabulary will grow, and the act of looking up the words will help ingrain the writing in your head.<br>  <br>  When you read, keep a pencil with you, and make notes in the margins of the book. Write anything that comes to mind. You might write an entire comment in the margin, or you might simply underline a phrase that catches your attention. By interacting with the book, you'll retain it better. <br>  <br>  Also, keeping a reading journal is helpful. At the end of each reading session, take a few minutes to write your thoughts on what you've just read, pose any questions you have, or simply summarize the plot if nothing else comes to mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some examples of the kinds of things you might write in the margin or in your journal:<br>  <br>  "Why did he smile when he said this?"<br>  "That reminds me of the guy next door."<br>  "Strange thing to say."<br>  "This is so true!"<br>  "Makes no sense; must research on the Web."<br>  <br>  Invest in a book or two on reading literature. I recommend "A Little Literature," but there are many great books out there on the subject.<br>  <br>  Finally, Sparknotes are not "cheating"! I've used them on occassion when I had a particularly hard time understanding something I've read (most recently Walden by Thoreau), and they can be a wonderful way to further understand a book or story.

Ua5Y9PeDaa	The design would be submitted to the college of arms by the person wishing the design. Only the designer or the herald who matriculated the arms knows what was really meant by that design, usually they just liked it. The blazon describing what the coat of arms looked like is recorded but the record of why usually does not survive.<br>  <br>  The arms you describe were matriculated in 1799 and declared extinct in 1815 because no heirs that could inherit those arms survived. ( Sir John St. Leger Gillman of County Cork) The history of this coat of arms that 4crests.com is telling is completely bogus.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Here is what I found in The General Armory about this Gillman Coat of Arms: Gillman (Curriheen, co. Cork, bart., extinct 1815: Sir John St. Leger Gillman was so created 1 Oct. 1799). Sable a dexter leg couped above the knee or. Crest - An eagle's head erased sable holding in the beak a lion's gamb erased or. Motto: Non cantu sed actu.<br>  <br>  I would think that what is said about the leg being a pun on St. Leger is probably the meaning of the leg on the shield. Also that the crest is the black eagle's head with the beak holding a golden lion's foot.|`|AA12343309	There is no such thing as a family crest.  A crest is part of a coat of arms and they don't belong to surnames. Actually, they don't belong to families.<br>  An exception in Europe might be France or Poland.  However, even there they don't belong to surnames.<br>  <br>  Peddlers selling coats of arms (they use the misnomer family crest) on the internet, at shopping malls, in airports, in magazines are out to make a buck.  That's all. <br>  <br>  Coats of arms were granted to or assumed by an individual man.  In Britain when he was granted a coat of arms, all sons were entitled to apply and have one granted to them with some differences.  Only the oldest son inherits his father's upon his father's death. <br>  <br>  To buy and display one of those little walnut plaques with a coat of arms on it is usurpation of identity.   If you think about it if you have pride in yoursel and your family you would not want to take on another's identity. <br>  <br>  You can design and have your own made.  Now if you are an American, I don't believe there is a way you can stop someone from usurping your identity as we don't have any laws regarding heraldy in the U. S.<br>  <br>  I am adding some links from different countries regarding heraldry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.ht...</a><br>  This is the British College of Arms. They are the ones that grant them for England, Northern Ireland and Wales.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bothwell.cx/arms.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bothwell.cx/arms.shtml</a><br>  This is regarding Scottish heraldry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heraldry.ws/info/article10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heraldry.ws/info/article10.ht...</a><br>  This is regarding Irish heraldry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.regalis.com/onom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.regalis.com/onom.htm</a><br>  This is regarding Italian heraldry<br>  <br>  The unfortunate thing about these merchants of deceit selling coats of arms is that a family history will come with them. That family history will not be the family history of everyone with that particular surname.  Many people starting out in family research have been thrown off because of those family histories.|`|lmVDvmMCaa	Q: How is a family crest/family seal/coat of arms decided upon?<br>  <br>  A: In continental Europe, where most arms are assumed, the most common approach is to include a charge from one's occupation and perhaps one's town or a nearby landmark.  Very often you would place your housemark (Hausmarke) on the shield.  Another common approach is to include a canting charge as a pun on your name, such as, for example, a leg if your name was Leger.  In the UK, this was the approach among commoners before heraldic regulation.  When the government required a grant of arms, submitted designs were either reworked by the state heralds, or the heralds designed a coat of arms based on personal information provided.  In Scotland, the tradition was to make arms of various branches of a clan somewhat similar, so that there was some visual affinity among the the different related families.   When you see impaled arms (joined down the middle) or quartered arms, this usually means they are combining the arms of members of the family who have married.<br>  <br>  Q: I found my surname family crest....<br>  <br>  You found someone's arms on the net, not yours.  There is no way to tell who owned these arms based on the bogus explanation on the website.  There are several coats of arms owned by people named Gillman, but you need to descend from an armiger.  Chances are, you don't, but you might.  <br>  <br>  Q: ...what does the leg mean?<br>  <br>  A: WIKIPEDIA: "The specific meaning of each element of a coat of arms is subjective. Though the original armiger may have placed particular meaning on a charge, these meanings are not necessarily retained from generation to generation. Unless canting arms incorporate an obvious pun on the bearer's name, it may difficult to find meaning in them." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry</a>|`|MbaP0u6iaa	LongTooth and Shirley T are both absolutely correct. <br>  <br>  BTW, the crest in that illustration isn't a leg; it's three ostrich feathers. There is a leg on the *shield*, but a shield isn't a crest. (You wouldn't wear a shield on your head, which by definition is what you do with a crest.)
05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	The only people who use private detectives are adoptees and children who have "Unknown" on their birth certificates where the father's name should be.<br>  <br>  You don't "look up" a family tree like you look up an article about bears in an encyclopedia, you research it. It won't be in one place.<br>  <br>  If you are in the USA, and most of your ancestors were, you can do it yourself for the cost of ancestry.com's "USA Collection - $159 a year, but you'd spend 100 - 300 hours, spread out over as many nights and weekends as your whimsy dictated. It isn't hard; anyone who can get a B on a high school history term paper can do it, but it does take time. You'd have to use obituaries, birth, death and marriage certificates and the like to get back to1930 or so, which is the latest census open to the public.<br>  <br>  You can do a decent, not stellar job of it for free, if you are lucky, but Ancestry makes it a LOT easier.<br>  <br>  Professionals charge $25 - $100 per hour, usually with an 8, 12 or 20-hour minimum.<br>  <br>  A poor but honest widow might do it for $10 - $15 per hour, cash under the table (Not completely honest; fiddle dee dee to the IRS). You'd find one through your local Family History Center or the county genealogy society, but tread warily; Mormons are notoriously honest, so don't suggest stiffing the government out loud.<br>  <br>  Anyone who guarantees they will find things or works for a set fee instead of an hourly one is suspicious.<br>  <br>  I offer 20 hours of my time at our church service auction every year. My "item" usually goes for $200 - $300. I'm not volunteering to work for you for that fee, just making a suggestion. <br>  <br>  If you attend a church that could use a little extra cash, you might offer to donate $200 to the church, over and above your annual pledge, if one of the members would spend 20 hours working on your problem. The member would get a puzzle to solve for fun (our version of the Sunday Times cross-word puzzle is a brand new family to track), the church would be $200 richer and you'd have a cancelled check made out the First Presbyterian / Methodist / Baptist Church with "Choir robes" or "Food for homeless" in the memo line, which you could claim on your income tax, again letting the IRS go whistle.<br>  <br>  You could ask, again at the county genealogy society or your local FHC, is anyone was willing to trade 10, 20, 30 hours of her time (75% of genealogists are ladies) for an equal amount of yours, if you are handy at auto tuneups, house painting, gardening, minor electrical repairs, chinse cooking . . .|`|AA12343309	It would have to be how much research the person would have to do, traveling, going to courthouses etc.  There are professionals. Perhaps you have a local genealogy society that can be helpful.<br>  <br>  You can do your own and my answer below I have cut and am pasting.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer.<br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	The short and sweet (honest) answer is that it probably costs more than you expect or want to pay. <br>  SOMETIMES it takes years to find one central fact. Other times, someone else has worked it, and you can find it in 10 minutes or less. No.. unless you are looking for personal/ private records (ie generally recent info on living persons), you should not need a private detective. Professional genealogists normally charge by the hour, and that means, if they find it, or not. Good ones are worth it, and that isn't ripping you off. <br>  There are thousands of free sites to use. It is a mistake to think it is all free. And yes, the two statements go hand in hand. <br>  Most of us here have been researching for years, and would advise that you do it personally. The reason is that the FUN of it is when YOU find the record, and break the challenge. I would not pay someone to go to dinner for me at Red Lobster.. they get all the fun. <br>  If you take a few minutes to stop over at www.rootsweb.com, there is a tutorial about the process. It isn't as hard as some think. You also can stop by www.cyndislist.com, which has thousands of sources..inlcuding an area about professionals, when to hire them, and what to expect.|`|DQ8WR6CXaa	try this ... it's pretty popular<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancestry.com/</a>

I mean it's just a typical self-help book that is meant to make you feel better for a moment, but you end up where you've started.<br>  <br>  Rich Dad, Poor Dad is much better and much more entertaining. It seems believable, 'cause it only tells the most basic things. There is a controversy surrounding the author of this book and how this book became the Newyork times bestseller. Some people have tried to investigate if the author really owns any valuable property or big assets. They've found that many things in the book are fictional.<br>  <br>  However, I still recommend that book because its basic concepts are 'common sense' and 'pretty much true'.<br>  <br>  :)

He eventually became a man who lived his life for politics and patriotism. Right now, however, he is associated with corrupt, totalitarian government. The reason for this is a small pamphlet he wrote called The Prince to gain influence with the ruling Medici family in Florence. The political genius of Niccolo Machiavelli was overshadowed by the reputation that was unfairly given to him because of a misunderstanding of his views on politics. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ctbw.com/lubman.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctbw.com/lubman.htm</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Kevin, Liverpool, England.|`|AA10572595	A purely Machiavellin U.S. govt.=NO! that is a huge statement .Look for pardons granted to individuals for an example of Machiavellin actions.Or light sentences.|`|bce4c3426de844e3e3f4d4ff54931637aa	The alternative title for "The Prince" should be "How to rule a country, attack another and keep people  under your thumb".<br>  <br>  On a serious note, Machiavelli is suggesting a fool-proof method of gaining and retaining control over any domain that you oversee, as well as managing the people within.

Victor knows those hands don't belong on Victor. Victor is very suspicious. Victor isn't taking pictures; Victor is being peeked at, like a private diary. OW! The feminine hands are heating up. They must have seen Alex's latest pictures.  Victor and Alex went to the mall yesterday and he took many pictures of skin, some skin called Victoria who has a secret. It was fun.  Uh oh. The icky hands are now deleting Alex's pictures from Victor. Victor doesn't  think Alex will like that very much. Victor is not going to let those hands delete any more. Uh oh. OWWWwww... Victor got hit. Now his chip hurts. Now Victor really dosen't like those repulsive hands. OH! Wait. Now there are four hands. The new ones are grimy and rough. They stink and Victor knows these are Alex's hands. But now Victor is being pulled in two directions. Victor fears his lenses will be separated forever. He hears many loud sounds. Then Victor decides he wants to be rid of these nasty hands. He builds up all his battery power and whips the wrists of the disgusting manicured hands and they let go. Hurray! Back to good old Alex.

n1a1lodGaa	This is the first of the Discworld books that feature the three witches of Lancre. <br>  <br>  It is somewhat a parady of the play MacBeth by Shakespeare.<br>  <br>  The three Lancre witches help to solve two mysteries: the death of the king, which has allowed an sinister Duke to take reign over the area and for the infant prince to go missing, and the mystery of the rightful heir to the throne.<br>  <br>  Along with the witches and the Duke, some of the other main characters are the ghost of the king, a troupe of entertainers, the Dutchess, and the Fool. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to a VERY detailed synopses:<br>  <a href="http://www.lspace.org/books/synopses/wyrd-sisters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lspace.org/books/synopses/wyr...</a>|`|751m0HoPaa	Plot summary for Wyrd Sisters (1997) (TV)<br>  <br>  Based on the Terry Pratchett novel. On Discworld, (a world carried on four elephants standing on a huge turtle travelling in space), in a small country called Lancre, three witches, the flowery Magrat Garlick, the lively Nanny Ogg and their leader Granny Weatherwax find themselves dragged into royal politics. The king of Lancre, Verence, has been murdered by Duke Felmet and he has taken over control of the country (but he is trapped under the control of his over-powering wife - the Duchess.) However there are two problems, firstly the Duke hates Lancre and the actual kingdom of Lancre is pressing the witches to find a king that would take better care of it. The second and bigger problem is that Verence's baby son has escaped and has fallen into the hands of the witches prompting the Duke's fury towards the witches. The son must be protected but Granny doesn't want to get involved with the situation but it looks like she doesn't have a choice in the matter...

BB6Rivt3aa	En primer lugar, te felicito porque es una pregunta interesante. El mundo se hizo para el hombre, diestro y heterosexual, pero hay una variedad de estilos y conductas que no se inventaron ayer. <br>  <br>  ?Qué hubiera pasado si la mujer dominara? Escencialmente lo mismo: el poder del género hubiera convertido a los hombres en pasivos, literalmente como aquella película de Tin Tan donde las mujeres dominaban la isla (no recuerdo el título, pero te la recomiendo).<br>  <br>  Pocas mujeres destacadas en la antiguedad, pocos de raza negra, pocos homosexuales... Pocos que eran muchos si se hubiesen juntado un día. <br>  <br>  El dominio del hombre en la historia se reduce a la fuerza física y al falo, pero lo moderno es ser más inteligente y menos bruto. Me da gusto vivir una época más libre, a pesar que el mundo aún arrastra sujetos de siglos pasados, la mujer, el hombre, las personas de distintas creencias, preferencia, tama?os y razas. TODOS cabemos en el mundo sin permitir que el yugo de supuestas "mayorías" o "normales" coarte nuestra existencia.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|03247545986b581c635039492afaa2f1aa	me sorprende que una mujer haga esta pregunta...|`|1fb1da7d0f7b3c28585eec0b7f9b14aaaa	Ya lo dijo Zorrilla en "Don Juan Tenorio":<br>  " Mujeres juntas ni DIJUNTAS"<br>  La mujer siempre es protagonista impulsando a los hombres a continuar, son las madres, esposas y hermanas las que nos impulsan.Un jefe, hombre o mujer, sin una secretaria que le pase tips, no puede con el cargo, porque de peque?os detalles se basan las grandes decisiones.Nuestra sociedad debe ser equilibrada nadie es más importante y si nadie se acuerda de las protagonistas es porque aún cunde el machismo ramplón.|`|cde798cd5df68ae4807ce28c8e10a11eaa	Hubieran hecho un banco de esperma y ya no necesitariamos a los hombres para nada! y por manipulación genética solo se tendrian puras ni?as. Las guerras se terminarían y toda sería mas bonito :)...pero muy aburrido sin los hombres :(|`|93cfd688e98bdfc10b6becfcb2fcd739aa	Un espanto... las mujeres con poder... terrible de sólo pensarlo. Salvo que sean como las amazonas. :D|`|FlTgsStzaa	Me gustaría el mundo gobernado por mujeres, pero inteligentes, porque seamos sinceras hay unos espécimenes que mejor dicho! Dios nos libre.<br>  Saludos|`|OtnrMtCAaa	NO QUIERO ENTRAR EN POLéMICA CON LOS HOMBRES.........BASTANTE TENGO YA  EN TOREO...........PERO NO LO ESTáN HACIENDO MUY BIEN .....CUANDO NO HAY MáS QUE GUERRAS , CONFLICTOS ECONóMICOS, HAMBRE Y DEMáS BARBARIDADES.  yo creo que si el mundo fuera gobernado por mujeres...........sería mas justo , más generoso ( la maternidad le dota a la mujer de forma innata de esa cualidad)  sería un mundo práctico....fijáos que la practicidad ,implica muchas cosas  ( para gobernar bien una casa hay que ser muy práctico, por ejemplo. ) y además en el mundo hay más mujeres pacifistas y animalistas .....por ejemplo.....no existirían las corridas de toros....me corto el cuello.<br>  <br>   un saludo.|`|STfDkQTyaa	Pienso que si el mundo hubiese sido construído desde la óptica de una mujer, existirían millones de opciones para garantizar a los ni?os que sean felices. Lo veríamos a todo con los ojos de madres. Hubiéramos construído sitios para que el ser al nacer tenga certeza de que estará vivo y que morirá por muerte natural y no por caos institucionales o sociales como sucede en este mundo machista.|`|ecJ1V19Waa	Todo lo que pudiera decir sería hipotético, así que, en realidad, no tengo fundamento alguno sobre el cual esgrimir mis argumentos. <br>  ?De qué premisas partirían mis argumentos respecto a la hipotética mujer sino del conocimiento mismo de esta mujer, es decir: de la mujer actual?<br>  ?De qué podría partir para conocer cómo sería la mujer, de lo que es la moral femenina con su supuesto ¨respeto por la vida¨, de la supuesta sensibilidad que se le achaca (?cómo sabemos que esos rasgos de ¨personalidad¨ no son consecuencia de una interacción social, esto es: naturales?), acaso no eso mismo cambiaría, eso no cambiaría todo? Por supuesto que sí, todo cambiaría. Si las mujeres dominaran no habría existido probablemente Aristóteles, ni Platón, ni Sócrates, ni la Grecia misma muy probablemente. Y, si la antigua Grecia y toda su cultura no hubiera existido, el paradigma de Roma habría cambiado y, por ende, el de toda nuestra cultura. Es inconcebible creer que existiría un imperio como el romano, ?no es así? ?O habría también mujeres guerreras como las amazonas, asesinando y conquistando ávidamente por poder? ?Cómo sabemos que no sería así? Basamos nuestro juicio en el conocimiento que tenemos de las mujeres, pero estas mujeres serían íntegramente distintas a las actualmente conocidas, o acaso ?serian iguales? Para nada. Es bastante aventurado decir que serían de tal o cual manera, ya que: TODO cambiaría. Todas las culturas que conocemos serían, de acuerdo a tu pregunta, dominadas por mujeres.        <br>  <br>  Son bastantes aspectos a considerar, es un tema muy extenso, esto simplemente es un boceto de lo que podría ser. <br>  <br>  El comportamiento que se considera ¨natural¨ en la mujer no sería lo que es. Ese comportamiento es consecuencia de una moral dominada por e varón; inversamente ?qué pasaría de lo contrario, el varon sería sensible y la mujer no? <br>  Si la mujer dominara no sería lo que es actualmente, cambiaría totalmente… <br>  Existe una gran diferencia entre dominar y ser dominado ?Creen en verdad que serían como son? Francamente yo no. <br>  Y la conclusión es que podría ser mejor o peor, nunca igual. Es bastante incierto decir que sería mejor o peor y no quiero equivocarme y emitir juicios falsos, ergo, digo que no lo sé.  <br>  <br>  saludos|`|fklcD5wOaa	Pienso que definitivamente hubiera sido un mundo mejor porque los hombres estan acostumbrados a abusar de todo y de todos, por lo tanto un mundo construido por mujeres seria mas justo. <br>  Por ejemplo: Los hombres por querer demostrar que son los mas fregones matan animales a palos o a personas: Tu crees que una mujer promedio pueda hacer eso? Yo creo que muy pocas hariamos eso por que pensamos en lo que sufren. <br>  <br>  Otro ejemplo: He basado mi teoria de que los hombres quieren tener poder por 2 cosas basicamente: "dinero y mujeres" y son capaces de hacer lo indecible por obtenerlos. ?Cuando has escuchado a una mujer decir (como un politico) "quiero tener retehartos viejos" o vulgaridades peores. <br>  <br>  En resumen, el espiritu de competencia y busqueda por mujeres y poder nos ha metido en muchos problemas a lo largo de la historia. <br>  <br>  Ahora: yo creo que en breve nosotros seremos capaces de dominarlos a ellos por que ya no estamos dispuestas a ser pasivas y somos mas justas, dedicadas, etc. <br>  Desgraciadamente tendremos que luchar en un mundo basado en sus reglas pero saldremos victoriosas. Si no me crees, preguntale al INEGI cuantas mujeres se han incorporado en el ultimo decenio a la vida laboral (muchas mas que hombres) y veras que lo que te digo es una promesa. <br>  <br>  ;-) Saludos|`|ibpNzBBkaa	este mundo seria mejor!!! jajaja, a veces me pregunto uqe fue lo que paso a lo largo de la historia que hizo que la mujer fuera secundaria??, me intriga mucho, porque he leido que en las primeras generaciones de hombres, especificamente en el homo sapiens el MATRIARCADO era la base de su organizacion, me parece interesante el dato, creo que simplemente el mundo seria mas equilibrado (para nosotros jajaja)seguramente la economia seria mejor al tener acaparados todos los puestos politicos, la politica internacionals eria ams conciliadora, ya que las mujeres tenemos mayor capacidad de organizacion, habria mas misantropas que misoginos como los hay en la historia, y veriamos sin fin de manifestaciones de hombres luchando por ganarse un papel acitvo en la sociedad, tal vez seria bello, pero lo que cuesta trabajo es lo que mas se aprecia y cre que la brecha que nos hemos abierto con los hombres y a pesar de los hombres ha sido grande, en un futuro no muy lejano considero que tendremos mucha ams representatividad...<br>  Gracias por dejarme so?ar un poco...<br>  Saludos|`|80858c425fc626ed60b214b3ce65b418aa	?que tan cierto es?<br>  <br>  <br>  Que las mujeres toman decisiones con el corazón<br>  y los hombres con el cerebro.<br>  <br>  ?Partiendo de que es cierto, podremos plantear la arquitectura?<br>  <br>  (no es comentario ni sexista ni machista, que conste)|`|amo1xUG4aa	Lo más probable es que haya sido sin guerras. Sin posesiones. Sin codicia. Sin sed de poder.<br>  <br>  La historia, y la sociología dan cuenta que en principio las familias eran matriarcados.  Porque la mujer conservaba a su lado los hijos, aunque fueran de distintos padres. <br>  <br>  Luego vinieron los hombres apropiándose de tierras, y para determinar quienes las heredaban se tornó a patriarcado. <br>  <br>  Ya ves, que una cosa surge de la otra. <br>  <br>  Pero en los próximos a?os, asistiremos a un cambio radical en la Humanidad, donde la mujer va a cobrar preponderancia. Y el fin de este caos de muerte, guerra, apropiación etc. llegará "Cuando una mujer jure sobre la NUeva Biblia".............. <br>  <br>  ------------------------------

wQNhCtHaaa	If you lead, be a good leader with good intentions. Get everyone to be involved and teach them to become leaders themselves. If you want to be led, cooperate with the leader, but be aware of the activities. If you lead, you can be too extreme that you are oppressing the followers (Hitler, Stalin, and other bad leaders). If you are led and unaware, you can be so brainwashed and unconscious of what you are doing. For example, the mindless consumers in North America.|`|n4aetMTlaa	To lead or not to lead?<br>  We are a complex beings. This means some of us are born to only do one or they other. I and many others are born somewhere in between, at times, when I can,  I will lead but during times of low energy etc. I will look for for some direction. Its  about knowing your self, to know when and where you are to lead or be led.|`|v2CmpNLAaa	I think we all lead and are, at the same time led.  If a 'leader' is not influenced by those he leads [led in abilities] to do his job, he, as a leader, is lessened.  Conversely, those who appear to be led form much of the support for the leader...thus sharing the responsibility and the leadership.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	A bit of vocabulary first. The "script" is the whole play. A "line" is what you mean by "19 or 20 scripts." <br>  <br>  I was in a few plays when I was younger, and I found that the best way to memorize the script is to read it over and over to yourself until you're sure you've memorized your lines, and then have someone read it with you, pretending to be the person you're talking to. <br>  <br>  Try to remember that it's not just random words you're memorizing. Your conversation has a point. When you realize why your conversation is in the play, and what your character is trying to say to the other person, you can remember your lines much easier.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and remember that it's just a play - no worries! :)|`|Os7SAmKYaa	I'm an actor,you should just take it slow and do it scene by scene.

Bajo la ventana de la residencia de Bolívar, frente al actual Teatro Colón, por donde realizó su escape, fue puesta una placa con la inscripción del cuadro lateral.<br>  <br>  Bolívar siguió gobernando en un ambiente enrarecido, acorralado por disputas fraccionales y sufriendo de tuberculosis. <br>  <br>  Bolívar dimitió de la presidencia el 20 de enero de 1830 en el congreso admirable pero esta no fue aceptada hasta el 4 de mayo de 1830 concediéndole una pensión de 3.000 pesos anuales.<br>  <br>  Bolívar emprende en un viaje destinado hacia Jamaica y Europa pero su enfermedad se lo impidió, y hubo de acogerse a la amistad y protección de un espa?ol, don Joaquín de Mier y Benítez, que lo invitó a quedarse en la Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino, cerca de la ciudad de Santa Marta.<br>  <br>  Bolívar llegó a Santa Marta el 6 de diciembre de 1830 tras una penosa travesía por el río Magdalena desde Bogotá y a pesar del buen clima y las atenciones recibidas, su salud empeoró a los pocos días, teniendo algunos momentos de lucidez que le permitieron dictar su testamento y su última proclama, donde un Bolívar gravemente enfermo clamó porque su muerte por lo menos permitiera la consolidación de la unión y la desaparición de los partidos.<br>  <br>  Finalmente El Libertador Simón Bolívar fallece el 17 de diciembre de 1830, a los 47 a?os de edad. A la una y tres minutos de la tarde murió el sol de Colombia, según rezó el comunicado oficial.

FtooO2YQaa	I'd expect VERY little. In some cases, if you self publish, you'll end up paying people more than you earn.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the heads-up. If only authors were paid as much as TV actors and actresses... (sigh)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|cciB0SmBaa	Jimhorne,<br>  <br>  First of all you'll need to find a literary agent, and they don't wait in line for writers. Your book will need to be free of any type of errors and have a well written synopsis to catch the eye of a potential literary agent. <br>  <br>  If a book sells for $15.00 and you get 12% of the booksales, you'd make around $1.80 per book sold. The money comes in when you have a million seller on the NY Times best seller list. $1.80 x one million . . . well, do the math. Then they may make a movie out of it. There's at least another half million or more for the rights. That's where the money comes in.<br>  <br>  Here's what I give everyone who asks about writing and publishing. It seems like a long list, but it can be done if you stick to it and do it right.<br>  <br>  Read on:<br>  <br>  Writing a book takes more than just sitting down and putting your idea into words. There are a lot of things that you have to consider.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye out for spelling and grammar errors. When typing fast with fresh ideas in our heads, we tend to forget ourselves. Check and recheck your work. Editors are very expensive these days.<br>   <br>  You’ll need to know how to write an effective ‘query letter’ to a literary agent. The letter will also include a synopsis that will hold the interest of the agent, and want to make him or her ask for the first three chapters of your work. Never send a manuscript to a publisher or literary agent without querying first. <br>  <br>  You’ll need to know how to format your manuscript. This includes the fonts (size and type) that most agents, editors, and publishers want. These are usually Courier New and Times New Roman (12 pt). Short stories and novels are formatted differently. You will need to follow submission guidelines just as they are laid down for your submissions. Anything less will result in your manuscript sent back or destroyed unread. <br>  <br>  You will need to know what Point of View (POV) is.  Know how to write in First Person Point of View. You’ll need to know the can and can not of each. <br>  <br>  Do you know how to write dialogue? How to format dialogue? This is very important and allows the author and his/her characters to communicate with the reader. Remember dialect as well. Dialect is how a person speaks. Your characters may be highly educated or dumber than dishwater. ‘Ain’t got none’ is highly acceptable when used properly by a character who is even less than street smart.  <br>   <br>  It’s a good idea to know some of the publishing laws. The use of names and places. <br>  <br>  These include<br>  o Delivery Of Satisfactory Copy <br>  o Permission for Copyrighted Material <br>  o Grant Of Rights <br>  o Proofreading and Author's Corrections <br>  o Advances and Royalties <br>  o Author's Warranties and Indemnities <br>  o Copies to Author <br>  o Option Clause<br>  <br>  Learn how to get a ‘word count of your work. Some novels have a prologue and an epilogue. You’ll need to know how to write them and why they’re used. <br>  <br>  Know what the word ‘genre’ means. Horror, Mystery, Science Fiction; These are all genres.<br>  <br>  One of the most important issues in manuscript submitting is the proper ‘page set up’ for your work. This includes margins, indents, and paragraphs. Most editors will want to see your manuscript double spaced. This allows the editor to use his/her proofreaders marks between the lines. Most margins will be one inch all around with a ragged right margin and an even left.<br>  <br>  Are you prepared to do a lot of ‘research’ involving your work? Remember that many professionals such as, doctors, lawyers, nurses, public accountants, judges, architects, bricklayers, engineers, and police officers read, too.<br>  <br>  Do you know what a sub-plot is? This is a plot that comes ‘under’ the main plot. The hero may be after the vampire, but the mob may be after the hero as well. This is a sub-plot.<br>  <br>  Can you take rejection and constructive criticism? If you’re easily hurt in the feelings department, then writing may not be your forte. Critics will tear you apart or build you up. The best writers in the world “King, Patterson, Koontz, J.K. Rowling, and many others” have been torn up one side and down the other. You can’t please everyone.<br>  <br>  If you decide to hire an editor, remember: Your manuscript will be double spaced, which means there will be twice as many pages. A 600 page novel could cost you around $1800.00, some even more depending on what the editor charges per page. Then there’s the hourly rate that some charge. Usually it’s within the range of $65.00. So, if they work on your book for 18 hours, that’s another $1170.00 + $1800.00 = $2970.00<br>  <br>  These are the things you must know to work at your craft. Don’t let these things deter you from writing. There are books in libraries and bookstores that can teach you all of these things. Buying these books (if you want to be a serious writer) is the best thing to do. Why? Well, because you can use a yellow marker to highlight all the points of interest. Then you can use the front of the book to make page references to those markings in order to check back on them at a later date, when you need to.<br>  <br>  You’ll need to get a copy of Writer’s Market for the current year. This has literary agents whom you can send out query letters to. Some of them allow email queries. They also have a website. Google: Writer’s Market.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|AA11502638	I hate to be the one to break the mood that being a writer is where it's at financially, but...well...let me explain.<br>  <br>  To be a writer in the first place, your heart should be in what you're writing, not how much cash flow you're going to get. For me, writing books is not so much a hobby as it is a lifestyle.<br>  <br>  The money will come, it just won't be right away. <br>  <br>  Spend your money on a publication that will draw many people in, if the money is what you desire. <br>  <br>  Personally, I have written a Stephen King style book that has been called "Brilliant," although yours is apparently informational.<br>  <br>  In short, good luck, and focus on your job at hand.|`|7ee1a91a4a9467e464a2780c88c39d5caa	Expect very, very little. The average salary for full-time authors in the UK is 8k (below the poverty line of 14k) and most of those do script work not prose fiction.<br>  <br>  If it helps, try writing a book in a popular genre. Poetry makes no money. Crime, cats and golfing books sell.|`|PBZn6Dfnaa	Expect nothing.  Unless you're J.K. Rowling, your pride and joy is going to sit on the shelf unnoticed save for some of your friends, a few random buyers, and your mother.  Do not give up hope though!  Everyone has to start somewhere.|`|aSxl6l0Gaa	You can check out some the answers I've written in my profile if you want to know how to get your work published. But in regards to your question, expect very little. Most, if not all, of my authors have jobs. Some are English professors, some are editors themselves. How much money  make depends on several factors, but it primarily depends upon your contract. You should not expect anything higher than 6-8 % on the initial run, 3-5 for the second run, or 2 for the remainder. Your contract will say something like "Author will receive 6% of the first 15,000 books sold, 3.5% for the next 15,000, and 2.5% for all books sold thereafter." That means for the first 15,000 copies of your book sold, you only get 6% of the net. For copies 15,001 to 30,001 sold, you get 3.5% of the net. For all the copies sold after 30,001, you get only 2.5% of the net. So, say, they sold 15,000 books at $19.00 a piece. That's 285K. Sounds like a lot, right? After all of the money is taken out for taxes, production costs, etc. You'd be lucky to get very much. <br>  <br>  The numbers are exact, mind you. It depends on if your book is for adults or for children's, if you were with an agent or not, if you're a first-time author or previously published by another house (self-published authors don't count, alas; sorry, guys), etc. <br>  <br>  Long story short: Don't quit your day job.|`|mOIgGTSlaa	Profits are based off Royalties which are based off sales.  Through a traditional publisher often contracts are based off of a step system, 10% royalties from the first 1000 books sold lets say, 12.5% from 1k to 2500, and then 15% from 5k on.  Then you must pay your agent approx 15% of your royalties.  So an example would be a $10.00 paperback, you get $1.00 royalty, your agent takes $.15, so you profit $.85.<br>  <br>  So again, your profit comes off of the number of books you sell.<br>  <br>  This is a general example and I am sure that not all contracts are these figures, but this is the idea.  So if you go into for the money, the odds are against you, but if you go into it for the love of writing, you will be very sucessful.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  J.

Pero quizá, es porque en la música hay muchas categorías, aquella que es considerada arte y aquella que es considerada moda o puro entretenimiento y por ello, requiere su apartado especial (alli mismo tiene su clasificación). Pero la música además de que a casi todos nos gusta (digo casi porque conozco a una persona que no), en el arte es un lenguaje tan abstracto, que pocos son las que la conocen a fondo y la aprecian por encima de la moda. De cualquier manera en esta sección, no siempre se habla de arte o humanidades, a veces hacen preguntas que nada que ver y aqui seguimos.

Frente al colorismo, a la importancia de los medios de comunicación de masas, frente al fenómeno de lo comercial y de un arte que se basaba en la apariencia, el minimalismo barajó conceptos diametralmente opuestos.

Así como la importancia del entorno como algo esencial para la comprensión y la vida de la obra.<br>  <br>  Los creadores minimalistas reducen al máximo los elementos propios del arte, los volúmenes y formas en escultura.

eIe248r2aa	La velocidad de marcha de la infantería se determina dependiendo de la característica principal del arma que usa determinado ejército, sin considerar de manera importante los pertrechos.(no existía tal consideración. La velocidad era determinada por factores de ataque/defensa)<br>  La cadencia de paso a 120 pasos por minuto tiene su origen en la guerra franco-prusiana de 1870. <br>  En esa época, se produce un adelanto tecnológico: el fusil a repetición, que hasta ese momento era de avancarga. Cuando el fusil era de avanacarga, su recarga llevaba aproximadamente 1 minuto, y por eso, la infantería avanzaba en dos líneas, a paso de hombre lento, para permitir que la primer fila abriese fuego en posición rodilla a tierra, mientras la segunda cargaba nuevamente el arma. En ese entonces, las marchas de infantería tenían una cadencia lenta, como se escucha hoy en la marcha "Los fusileros de la Reina".<br>  Durante la guerra franco-prusiana, se agrega una nueva innovación: al no ser la recarga un motivo de desplazamiento lento de la infantería, las tropas a pie comienzan a moverse a una velocidad inusual para esa época: 5 kilómetros por hora, velocidad para la cual las tropas de infantería eran convenientemente entrenadas al punto tal que podían marchar hasta 16 horas por día, es decir 80 kilómetros por día, durante varios días consecutivos. <br>  Espero que te sirva la información.

En los tiempos modernos una marcha va acompa?ada de una banda musical en la que intervienen varios tipos de instrumentos de viento y percusión.<br>  <br>  La marcha militar se estructura principalmente con pasos. Los pasos pueden ser largos, cortos, rápidos, lentos, etc. La ejecución de los pasos que implican la marcha puede hacerse acompa?ada con música de marcha o simplemente con órdenes de palabra que ejecuta algún mando. De acuerdo con esta variedad las marchas pueden ser de:<br>  <br>  Paso corto, a razón de 120 pasos por minuto con una longitud de 33 cm en la zancada. <br>  Paso atrás, que es un movimiento retrógrado.

En 1901 Benito logró terminar su educación que le permitiría ser maestro de escuela, pero un a?o más tarde prefirió irse a Suiza. Sin poder encontrar un empleo fijo, fue arrestado bajo cargos de vagancia y fue expulsado de Suiza. Tuvo que regresarse a Italia para poder hacer su servicio militar. Tras tener más problemas con la policía,se sumó al periódico en el pueblo austríaco de Trento en 1908. <br>  <br>  Como periodista empírico hizo sus primeros pinitos y hasta osó escribir una novela llamada La Querida del Cardenal. Cuando los austríacos se cansaron de sus desmanes y lo expulsaron, fue a para a Forli como editor de un periódico socialista llamado La Lucha de Clase. En 1910 Mussolini sería el secretario del partido socialista en Forli.En esta etapa de la vida, sus ideas eran diametralmente opuestas a las que tendría en el cenit de su carrera política. Se jactaba de ser un antipatriota y cuando Italia le declaró la guerra a Turquía en 1911, fue apresado por difundir propaganda pacifista en su periódico. <br>  <br>  Logrando que lo hicieran editor del periódico oficial socialista Avanti, se mudó a Milán, donde hizo labor proselitista entre los dirigentes obreros.El manifestaba que los obreros debían conglomerarse en fascios(motetes) para poderse preparar para la toma del poder. Algunos vieron esto como el inicio del movimiento fascista. La megalomanía de Benito ya venía en ascenso, y sus parrandas en los burdeles de Milán se hicieron tristemente célebres. Algunos creen que en una de esas visitas a los lupanares, pesco la tremenda sífilis que habria de llevarlo a una serie de trastornos que afectaron su vida como político.<br>  <br>  A la hora de casarse Mussolini escogió a una buena chica, Rachele Guidi, ex alumna suya que trabajaba en una fonda. Como buen socialista que Benito decía ser, le dijo a Rachele que el matrimonio era cosa de burgueses y que era mejor solo arrejuntarse.<br>  <br>  Cuando la madre de la chica se enteró de que Benito le quería hacer la leona a su hija, fue a arrastrar a Benito, quien ni corto ni perezoso sacó una pistora e hizo una oferta que la dama no pudo rechazar. "Hay siete balas, 5 para mí, una para Rachele y otra para usted. "La airada suegra cedió pero Benito con el correr de los a?os legalizó su unión para legitimar los hijos y desmentir que Ida dalser (una ex amante de Benito) se autoproclamara la Sra. Mussolini. Habría de tener varios hijos con ella y permanecer atado a Rachele, pero solía practicar la violencia intrafamiliar, pegando a su esposa y sus hijos. También Mussolini le habría de dar amplio quehacer con numerosas mujeres. Tuvo un fling con la periodista francesa Magda Fontanges, y muchas veces llegaba bolo a casa, hasta que un día Rachele amenazó con matarlo si volví a llegar arreando chanchos floreados.<br>  <br>  Aunque Rachele y Benito nunca se separaron, Benito habría de encontrar el amor con Clara Petacci, una jovencita que fracasó en su matrimonio al ser casada contra su voluntad. Las relaciones entre Clara y Benito durarían más de 10 a?os, siendo la querida oficial de Benito. Benito instalada a Clara en bellísimos apartamentos de lujo y en uno de ellos Rachele se enfrentó con la querida. Iracunda ante el lujo que su esposo derrochaba con Clara, le gritó a Clara que algún día iría a parar a la Piazzale Loreto (lugar de reunión de las prostitutas vetustas), lo cual resultó ser una macabra predicción. Benito era tiempo y fogoso con Clara, y la cuidó con primor cuando Clara perdió al hijo de ambos y se escapó de morir Clara llegaría a amar tanto a su maloliente Benito que cuando éste perdió el poder y los partisanos lo buscaron para ajusticiarlo, ella ofreció morir por él. <br>  <br>  Los partisanos le habían dicho que ella podá irse, y el 28 de abril de 1945 cuando los partisanos optaron por fusilar a Benito, ella interpuso u cuerpo frente al de Benito en un tonto intento de salvarlo. Benito pasa a la historia como un peligroso hombre cuyo carisma político lo llevó muy lejos. El rey italiano Victor Manuele III- quien era tan pusilánime que no mandaba ni a traer las pastas de su casa- le tuvo tanto miedo a él y el poder de sus fascistas que optó por nombrarlo primer ministro. Curiosamente, luego ganaría el apoyo popular en elecciones y cabe mencionar que bajo el mando de Benito se estabilizó la economía italiana, se iniciaron importantes obras públicas y hubo prosperidad. Pero Benito tuvo el mal tino de aliarse con Hitler, cometer tantas torticerías contra los judíos que hasta el pianista polaco judío Arturo Rubinstein le rechazó un galardón, y actuó de una forma errática. <br>  <br>  Se hizo alérgico al agua y el jabón, prohibió que la Alfa Romero pintara sus carros de rojo pues solo el suyo podía lucir ese color y se hizo el ídolo de genios como el compositor operático Pietro Mascagni, el ingeniero Gugliegmo Marconi y el novelita Gabriele D’ Annunzio. Sus afanes expansionistas salieron a luz cuando se fue de necio a Grecia, y a nadie sorpendió que en 1943 se viera echado del poder. Era de esperarse que dos a?os después de perder el poder y no gozando de la protección de los alemanes, los partisanos le pasaran la cuenta. Tras ser fusilados Benito y su amante Clara, los cuerpos fueron llevados a papachín por el pueblo, quien procedió a orinarse y defecarse encima de ellos. Una vez en la Piazzale Loreto, los cuerpos hediondos fueron colgados para seguir siendo vilipendiados, siendo acertada la predicción de la esposa de Benito.|`|b7bfe78846f0edc2590687bbbd0daffdaa	Neonazi es un término que se utiliza para referirse a los grupos posteriores a la Segunda Guerra Mundial que continúan apoyando y difundiendo las ideas del nacionalsocialismo.<br>  <br>  Los nacionalsocialistas creen principalmente en la determinación biológica como factor decisivo en la definición de las labores que ha de ejecutar un individuo.

Sin embargo, también creen en la ciclidad de la historia, como Spengler, y sostienen que las civilizaciones creadas por los arios decaían y morían una vez sus elementos representativos se mezclaban racialmente con miembros de otras razas.<br>  <br>  SUERTE!

Se distinguían por su idioma, sociedad y tradición histórica. Los relatos tradicionales colocan su lugar de origen en las regiones norte, noreste de Grecia, antigua Macedonia y el Epiro, donde circunstancias desconocidas los condujeron hacia el sur, dentro del Peloponeso, a ciertas islas del Egeo, y a la costa de Asia Menor. Esta expansión se produjo en torno al 1200 a.C. Durante cierto tiempo se consideró su irrupción como una invasión que desestabilizó los estados micénicos destruyendo sus formas culturales, sustituyéndolas por la de los invasores. Esta teoría esta hoy día siendo revisada al no encontrarse pruebas de la mencionada invasión y sí pruebas de una cohabitación más prolongada. Su área de dominio histórico los sitúa en el Peloponeso y en época clásica con el desarrollo de la cultura espartana, ejemplo eminente de la sociedad doria.

Gy5f4VgQaa	Saludos. En pocas palabras, y parrafos resumidos, la Guerra Fria, fue un enfrentamiento no directo, entre las dos grandes potencias del mundo, que lo dividieron despues de la segunda guerra mundial. Por una lado estaba los EEUU con sus alidos, y por el troo, el bloque Sovietico por la URSS y los paises comunistas y socialistas. Esta comienza en 1949, masomenos, cuando se empiezan a crear tratados anticomumnistas y anticapitalistas. <br>  <br>  Esta guerra abarco casi todo el globo terraqueo. Incluso paises no tan desarrollados, como Cuba, sirvieron para hacer detonar al guerra. Fue una gran crisis que se amtnuvo durante 40 a?os, en los cuales EEUU y la URSS se amenazaban. Esta guerra no fue direxctamente , puesto que que jamas se tomaron als armas. Solo en un momento critico, los EEUU intentaron declarar la guerra, al establecer la URSS, en Cuba, una base misiles. Este fue llamado la crisis de los misiles, pues todo el mundo estba a la expectativa, de que ninguno de los dos paises se atacaran, pues los dos contaban con una gran arsenal de armas nucleares. La guerra culmino en 1989, con la caida del muro de Berlin, y en 1990 cuandos e firmo el tratado de desarme nuclear por parte de los dos paises. <br>  <br>  Un peuqe?o resumen. Espero que te sirva.|`|AKgoY0Gwaa	1) Ideológica.<br>  <br>  2) Estructural o Sistémica.<br>  <br>  1) Ideológica: Sistemas políticos y económicos opuestas, en Estados Unidos el liberalismo y el capitalismo y en la Unión Soviética, la socialización económica y el socialismo.<br>  <br>  2) Estructural o Sistémica:<br>  <br>  · Equilibrio de Poder. La estructura mundial anterior era multipolar. Desaparecen las potencias (tres potencias) y emergen dos que se enfrentan por mantener el equilibrio en el sistema, intentan maximizar el poder, tener el control del sistema internacional (conflicto de intereses directo), lo que atiende a una lógica realista (el conflicto va relacionado con el poder).<br>  <br>  · Vacío de Poder. Cuando termina la II Guerra Mundial se crea un vacío de poder tanto por parte de los vencedores como por parte de los vencidos. Una parte de los vencedores pierden poder (Reino Unido, Francia) y Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética llenan este vacío. También se da un vacío de poder por parte de los vencidos, es decir, que Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética llenarán el vacío de poder que se crea tras vences a Alemania y a Japón. Esta lógica encaja en lo que se demostrará mas tarde en la guerra de Corea y de Vietnam.<br>  <br>  Otras explicaciones: Política interna, es decir, control de la ciudadanía (por parte de Stalin y Truman), situación del “peor escenario posible” (miedo en la población), peligro de la situación de entreguerras (apaciguamiento). Todo esto se plasmaba en que si un actor cede a favor de otro puede ser interpretado o bien como un gesto de buena voluntad o bien como un signo de debilidad, por lo que se lleva a cabo un combate contra los signos de debilidad conllevando por tanto a un enfrentamiento.|`|QCnGBwhiaa	Según Pablo de Irazazábal[1] existen pocas definiciones de este conflicto nunca declarado y una de las mejores, para él, la dio Giampaolo Calchi-Novati:<br>  <br>  "Guerra fría es el estado de tensión entre potencias o bloques en el cual cada una de las partes adoptaban una política que tiende al reforzamiento a expensas del adversario, sin llegar a las acciones de una guerra caliente."<br>  <br>  Definición que recoge dos de las características más importantes como son:<br>  <br>  Bloques enfrentados. <br>  Estado de tensión. <br>  Según algunos investigadores e historiadores la guerra fria se puede definir de la siguiente manera:<br>  <br>  Conflicto global desarrollado entre 1945 y 1991, protagonizado por los Estados Unidos de América, y la Unión de Repúblicas Socialistas Soviéticas. Ocupó un protagonismo clave en el siglo XX y marcó todos los conflictos que se desarrollaron entre los a?os 50 y los 90 del mismo. Dividió al mundo en dos bloques: occidental y oriental. El primero englobaba, pese a unas excepciones, a toda América, Europa Occidental y la mayor parte de Oceanía, así como Corea del Sur, Japón y Taiwán. El bloque oriental englobaba a Europa Oriental, China, Cuba y a diversos países en áfrica y en el Sudeste de Asia. Estos dos bloques estaban bien definidos y eran totalmente antagonistas, ya que se diferenciaban en el terreno ideológico, político, militar, y más marcadamente en el campo económico. <br>  Estos bloques políticos estaban divididos en países capitalistas, mal llamados occidentales dirigidos por EEUU, contrapuestos a los países socialistas, mal llamados orientales, dirigidos por la URSS. A su vez, los dos bloques enfrentados formaron a su alrededor grandes campos de influencia político-militar, y arrastraron a los demás países del globo al conflicto, mediante movimientos políticos, y/o acciones militares directas o indirectas (por medio de algún aliado regional). Lo que diferencia a la guerra fría de cualquier contienda militar o diplomática anterior es que las dos superpotencias enfrentadas (los EEUU y la URSS) nunca se enfrentaron directamente, utilizando sus fuerzas armadas una contra la otra, sino aprovechando (e incluso provocando) conflictos regionales entre sus aliados y/o países terceros (no alineados) e interviniendo en estos conflictos, llegando incluso a ayudar a uno de los dos bandos mediante envíos de ayuda militar, o de apoyo económico o político de diferente índole dependiendo del país, y la situación estratégica o política de la región.<br>  <br>  En algunas ocasiones muy se?aladas, uno de los contendientes se enfrentaba directamente contra uno de los aliados del otro (EEUU contra Vietnam del norte) Aunque era más habitual que las dos potencias apoyaran guiándose por afinidades ideológicas a un bando o bandos de los enfrentados en una guerra civil (ejemplo: guerra civil de Angola, guerra civil griega) En la cronología de la guerra fría, existen puntos de se?alada tensión, que estuvieron a punto de hacer estallar una Tercera Guerra Mundial. Estos puntos de máxima tensión fueron siempre apaciguados por los dos bandos, mediante concesiones mutuas ante el peligro de un conflicto mayor de índole internacional y con la utilización por parte de la URSS y de EEUU de armas atómicas capaces de acabar con la vida sobre la tierra.<br>  <br>  <br>   Antecedentes  [editar]Véase también: Cronología de la Guerra Fría. <br>  <br>   Desconfianzas mutuas  [editar]Imagen:Yalta summit 1945 with Churchil, Roosvelt, Stalin.jpg <br>  Churchill, Roosevelt y Stalin durante la Conferencia de Yalta.Aunque aliados durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945), Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética desconfiaban mutuamente de la sinceridad de su alianza. Al final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial las tensiones entre los vencedores eran ya patentes, especialmente tras la Cumbre de Potsdam y la cancelación de la Cumbre de Washington. Churchill y Truman veían a la Unión Soviética de Stalin como un aliado poco fiable,[2] con constantes roces y problemas en Berlín y una política inflexible sobre sus demandas en las cumbres de Teheran y Yalta.[3]<br>  <br>  Más preocupante aún resultaban las intenciones del Gran Perro Rojo, como le denominó el general Curtis LeMay. Los aliados estaban preocupados y le tentaban para conocer sus preocupaciones. En Potsdam, Harry S. Truman le comentó brevemente a Stalin que poseían un arma de una potencia desconocida hasta el momento, tal y como había quedado con Winston Churchill para conocer sus preocupaciones, y sólo consiguió de él una felicitación y el deseo de que la utilizara fructíferamente contra Japón, aun en guerra con Estados Unidos.[2] Aun antes de acabar la guerra, era opinión de determinados sectores aliados que se debía continuar el avance de los ejércitos del frente europeo hasta conquistar Rusia, en la que, dominada por el severo régimen impuesto por Yóssif Stalin, se veía un peligro.<br>  <br>  Los EE.UU. defendían la política capitalista, argumentando ser la representación de la democracia y de la libertad. Por su parte, la URSS enfatizaba el socialismo y la justicia social como respuesta al dominio burgués y solución para los problemas sociales.<br>  <br>  Bajo la influencia de ambas doctrinas, Europa y Asia quedaron divididas en dos bloques, con peque?as excepciones como Suiza; cada uno liderado por la superpotencia que había ocupado o liberado de los nazis o de los japoneses el país correspondiente. A partir de ese momento comenzó la pugna por atraerse aliados en el resto del mundo. Estados Unidos logró su predominio económico y cultural en la Europa Occidental, Oceanía y todo el continente Americano, salvo casos como Cuba y después Nicaragua. La URSS en principio sólo contaba con las naciones que había liberado en Europa Central y del Este, en las que se incumplió el compromiso de celebrar elecciones, más la parte de Corea por encima del paralelo 38, la línea marcada para separar la línea de fuego estadounidense de la soviética.[1]<br>  <br>  <br>   De la Teoría de la Contención a la Guerra de Corea (1947-1953)  [editar]<br>   La Doctrina Truman  [editar]En 1947 se propuso la Doctrina Truman. Tenía dos objetivos:<br>  <br>  1.- Enviar ayuda estadounidense a las fuerzas anticomunistas de Grecia y Turquía.<br>  <br>  2.-Crear un consenso público por el cual los estadounidenses estarían dispuestos a combatir en un supuesto conflicto.<br>  <br>  Alcanzó ambos objetivos.<br>  <br>  <br>   El Bloqueo de Berlín  [editar]Artículo principal: Bloqueo de Berlín<br>  En el Bloqueo de Berlín (junio de 1948 a mayo de 1949) Alemania se encontraba justo en el corazón de la Guerra fría. Desde el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, fue dividida en varias zonas de ocupación entre Francia, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética. A su vez, Berlín sufrió la misma división en cuatro partes, formándose después el Berlín Occidental -controlada por Estados Unidos y sus aliados- y Berlín Oriental -controlada por la Unión Soviética y sus aliados. Todo Berlín quedaba rodeado por la zona comunista, sin embargo se acordó la comunicación con las otras zonas por medio de corredores aéreos, autopistas y vías férreas. En 1948, el sector de ocupación francés se reunió con los sectores inglés y estadounidense en lo que se podría llamar una “trizona”, en la que fue puesto en circulación el Deutsche Mark (a fin de acabar con la inflación que duraba hasta ese momento). Stalin intentando reunir los sectores berlineses bajo su tutela, en abierta violación de los Acuerdos de Yalta (Berlín Occidental era un bastión occidental en pleno sector soviético), decidió el bloqueo de Berlín: el 23 de junio de 1948, todas las vías de acceso terrestre fueron cerradas.<br>  <br>   <br>  Alemania, tras la derrota de 1945, dividida en zonas ocupadas por los Aliados.Los Estados Unidos desplazaron entonces tres escuadras de bombarderos estratégicos B-29 de la USAF en el Reino Unido para dar a entender que estaban listos a responder ante una eventual invasión de Europa Occidental y no realizaron grandes esfuerzos para impedir que la inteligencia soviética supiera que transportaban bombas atómicas; pero sin llegar, en ningún momento, a amenazar con un ultimátum atómico (en aquel tiempo disponían del monopolio nuclear) para hacer cesar el bloqueo de Berlín por la URSS y empujarla a retirarse de todos los países que había liberado. Stalin se mostró inflexible ante esa posibilidad negándose a respetar los acuerdos de Yalta, los cuales preveían la ayuda a los estados hasta entonces dependientes del Eje para "resolver sus problemas económicos más urgentes" así como a "constituir gobiernos democráticos representativos del conjunto de corrientes políticas de sus poblaciones". La potencia militar convencional del bloque oriental era de lejos superior a la de los ejércitos de una Europa en plena reconstrucción, el Oeste no quería desencadenar una nueva guerra mundial, corría el chiste según el cual Dinamarca necesitaba como único ejército un despacho con un teléfono para llamar a Moscú cuando entraran los carros de combate en su territorio y decir "nos rendimos".<br>  <br>  Los estadounidenses pusieron entonces en marcha un gigantesco puente aéreo: todos los aprovisionamientos fueron enviados por avión e incluso hidroavión. Para una población de más de dos millones de habitantes, y durante once meses, un transporte aterrizaba cada treinta segundos en medio del aeropuerto de Tempelhof (Berlín occidental). El 12 de mayo de 1949, consciente de su fracaso, Stalin decidió poner fin al bloqueo.

Los límites temporales del enfrentamiento se ubican entre 1945 y 1948 (fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y fin de la posguerra respectivamente) hasta 1985 (inicio de la Perestroika) y 1991 (disolución de la Unión Soviética).<br>  <br>  Definición que recoge dos de las características más importantes como son:<br>  <br>  Bloques enfrentados. <br>  Estado de tensión. <br>  Según algunos investigadores e historiadores la guerra fria se puede definir de la siguiente manera:<br>  <br>  Conflicto global desarrollado entre 1945 y 1991, protagonizado por los Estados Unidos de América, y la Unión de Repúblicas Socialistas Soviéticas. Ocupó un protagonismo clave en el siglo XX y marcó todos los conflictos que se desarrollaron entre los a?os 50 y los 90 del mismo. Dividió al mundo en dos bloques: occidental y oriental. El primero englobaba, pese a unas excepciones, a toda América, Europa Occidental y la mayor parte de Oceanía, así como Corea del Sur, Japón y Taiwán. El bloque oriental englobaba a Europa Oriental, China, Cuba y a diversos países en áfrica y en el Sudeste de Asia. Estos dos bloques estaban bien definidos y eran totalmente antagonistas, ya que se diferenciaban en el terreno ideológico, político, militar, y más marcadamente en el campo económico. <br>  <br>  Estos bloques políticos estaban divididos en países capitalistas, mal llamados occidentales dirigidos por EEUU, contrapuestos a los países socialistas, mal llamados orientales, dirigidos por la URSS. A su vez, los dos bloques enfrentados formaron a su alrededor grandes campos de influencia político-militar, y arrastraron a los demás países del globo al conflicto, mediante movimientos políticos, y/o acciones militares directas o indirectas (por medio de algún aliado regional). Lo que diferencia a la guerra fría de cualquier contienda militar o diplomática anterior es que las dos superpotencias enfrentadas (los EEUU y la URSS) nunca se enfrentaron directamente, utilizando sus fuerzas armadas una contra la otra, sino aprovechando (e incluso provocando) conflictos regionales entre sus aliados y/o países terceros (no alineados) e interviniendo en estos conflictos, llegando incluso a ayudar a uno de los dos bandos mediante envíos de ayuda militar, o de apoyo económico o político de diferente índole dependiendo del país, y la situación estratégica o política de la región.<br>  <br>  SUERTE!|`|XjtO4bctaa	Se denomina Guerra Fría al enfrentamiento político, ideológico, económico, tecnológico y militar que tuvo lugar durante el siglo XX entre los bloques occidental-capitalista, liderado por Estados Unidos, y oriental-comunista, liderado por la Unión Soviética, del que se separó posteriormente China para ir creando su propia esfera de influencia.<br>  <br>  Estos dos bloques se caracterizan por jugar a las cartas nunca directamente, siempre uno directamente contra un aliado del otro o dos aliados de cada bloque entre sí.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	1. Dan is the star, whereas Emma and Rupert are "only" the sidekicks. (Sucks, I know.)<br>  <br>  2. JKR planned this out for years, you should ask her. I think it was horrible George had to remain behind without his twin.<br>  <br>  3. Harry survived the killing curse in the forest because it actually only killed the Horcrux in his scar. Also, Voldemort was using the Elder Wand, which was rightfully Harry's at the time, and so would not kill its owner.<br>  <br>  4. They have to condense a lot of material into a two-hour movie, and a lot of times the directors take liberties with the plots. I've learned to get over them, and actually appreciate them as a whole new side-series of Potter stories.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	1. I HAVE NO IDEA because Radcliffe has little talent compared to Rupert Grint, who IS Ron. And Radcliffe is just a bad impersonation of Harry. Did you know that Daneil Radcliffe is the richest kid on the planet? No joke. I wish it was a joke though, he doesn't deserve it.<br>  <br>  2. *puts on a Trelawney-type voice* Because Rowling always envisioned that the stronger of the twins would die... it felt right *draws rainbow in the air* (I'm obviously not a fan of Rowling- the books are great, but she's money-hungry)<br>  <br>  3. Oh, something about choices. When he was at the train platform thing, he chose to come back to life. I don't know how that was possible. Apparently Rowling figured it was good enough because magic can do anything.<br>  <br>  4. THIS one, I can give you a great answer. Think of photagraphy and painting. If you were to take a picture of a particular piece of scenery, and paint the same thing in the impressionist style (think Monet), both are art, right? Just different media and a different take on the same thing. Well, a book is one piece of art of one media (and the original idea- the photograph, if you will) and the movie is the impressionist painting- another piece of art of a different media, and with another take on the same thing. So that's why. (Plus there's only so much you can do in a film, whereas in a book, you're free to run wild.) And you should look at both the movie and book for what it is, not what it should have. They're both art, no matter how weird that sounds.|`|aAlvyHxbaa	1) Probably because it would be more difficult to replace the lead actor for the last films than the supporting actors, so Daniel is worth more to the producers.<br>  <br>  2) I don't know, I think it was a pointless death as it had no relevance to the plot. JKR said in an interview that she knew for a while that if one of the twins died, it would be Fred.<br>  <br>  3) He didn't actually die. When Mouldywarts used the killing curse on him it made Harry unconscious but it only killed the part of Voldy's soul that was in him, not Harry himself. So Harry survived. He didn't die because the blood Voldy took from him in GoF strengthened the bond between them, tying Harry to life as long as he is a horcrux.<br>  <br>  4)Lots of reasons, including:<br>  a-It's very difficult and expensive to do some special effects<br>  b-The films need to be kept short, and the books are very long<br>  c-The film directors need to make the films tense and dramatic, the books have bits where the drama dies down for a while.<br>  <br>  I'm sure I've already answered this!|`|EmAJD3miaa	#1- Actors and actresses usually get paid by what they agree to. Daniel Radcliffe must had just wanted to be paid more then Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. <br>  <br>  #2- In almost all long series, someone has to die or else the readers think that no one will die.<br>  <br>  #3- Harry came back to life because there was a part of Voldemort's  soul in Harry.<br>  <br>  #4- Most movies have to simplify the plot so the movies aren't too long.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you. :]|`|XPhYkd38aa	1) I think the press thought that Daniel did a better job than the rest of the cast. And the producers had to agree (but Im not sure)<br>  <br>  2) I defenitly cried during that part! But JK Rowling probably thought it would be more dramatic.<br>  <br>  3) The fans didn't want the hero to die (even thought it was weird in the book)<br>  <br>  4) I don't know, but after you read the books the movies just don't really make sense.|`|b49a150fdfe7d071089fab93b14cbf9eaa	1. I don't know... maybe because Dan is the "star" of the show? I really don't have any other answer to that<br>  <br>  2. Because it was a battle going on, it was war, and in wars people die and sometimes those who die are people close to you... Fred died just because... that's what happens in wars<br>  <br>  3. Because Harry had Voldemort's soul inside and it was that bit what died... Harry didn't die because Voldemort kept Lily's enchantment alive in his blood therefore, kept Harry alive. It was Harry's decision to go on but he wanted to come back and finish his job.<br>  <br>  4.

Dan Radcliffe has more of a speeching roll and is on film more so his salary is larger. Also he has a good manager who threatend to have dan leave the movie if his pay was not raised.<br>  <br>  2) J.K. Rowling killed off fred because she new that he was popular and if he died people would want to read more and she would get more money.(the more drama the more cash$$)<br>  <br>  3) Again J.K. Rowling wanted to be dramatic and kill off harry but the main charector couldn't exactly die in the middle of the book now could he. The only solution? Bring harry back with some deap mystic magic.<br>  <br>  4) The movies are different from the books because (or so the directors, producers, and script writers think) some things sound better in books than they look on screen. Also it is cheeper for them to do some things than others.<br>  <br>                         Hope I helped!!!<br>                                     Sophie H.|`|rZNkHZLpaa	1)because hes the main caracter and the movies and books are all bout him<br>  <br>  2)because j.k. rowling is cruel and wants 2 make us suffer<br>  <br>  3)imho(in my humble opinion)- its because of the connection between him and voldemort. voldemort hat 2 kill harry or harry had 2 kill voldemort so either of them had to die anyway<br>  <br>  4)because movie producers love to lie and make things more xciting<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|0LR9BtRcaa	1. Because Daniel Radcliffe is the main actor whereas, while Rupert and Emma ARE the next most important, they are still borderline supporting in comparison. <br>  <br>  2. Because that's what JKR saw fit to do. <br>  <br>  3. Because he was willing to die for everyone to save them. It's explained in that chapter when he meets with Dumbledore at the train station. <br>  <br>  4.

I thought I had read somewhere that he said it had to be equal but I could of imagined it.<br>  <br>  Fred died because that is what JK felt needed to happen.  In a perfect world she wouldn't of killed off any of them.  The great thing about JK is that even though she didn't want it to happen and it hurt her to write people's death she had a vision in her head and had to go with it no matter what<br>  <br>  When Voldermont and Harry were fighting at the end of the 7th book and Voldermont released the killing curse, he do so with the elder wand, the elder wand beleived that Harry was its true master.  So it was not as strong.  Voldermont also killed the part of his soul that was inside of Harry.  Harry had a choice, like we all do in life, he could of given up and died or faught.  Harry, being the kind of person that he is, would not give up so he came back.  The baby that you see in the "dream scene" crying laying in the bundle is the part of Voldermonts soul that was killed by Voldermont himself.  Harry gave Voldermont a chance to redeem himself.  If he would of redeemed  himself then he wouldn't of died.<br>  <br>  As far as the movies being different than the books, I have no clue on that one.  I understand that they can not put everything from the books in the movies, and really that is okay with me.  I enjoy seeing the images I see inside my own head after reading JK's words come to life.  What upsets me is when the totally change the whole darn thing.  The 3rd and 5th movies were the worse.  The 3rd movie left out the whole thing with the Mauders map and who created it, why Harry produced a stage.  The 5th movie allowed stinky ol Ms. Umbridge burst through the wall of the room of requirement, which NEVER could of happened.  I look forward to the movies but not nearly as much as I do the books.  I can read and read the books over and over but really can not watch the movies like that.  The first movie is the one and only that actually flowed like the book.

It's a classic Romeo&Juliet story about two people from different worlds who come together and initially unite their families (in this case teams and fellow peers), which i think teaches a great message, because the truth is no one is really better than the other, some have looks, some have talent, some have brains, and that's okay, to each his own, right?

Also - pink hair, grumpy djinns (or genies), and scarecrow stalkers - it's funny too! Mz. Jones has written a lot of other books too - many are part of her Crestomaci series (which is also amazing).

8bRmxn6paa	I don't think its a need... It's a feeling, an urge that can and must be conquered... Revenge only begets more hate and anger, bringing about more revenge... It's an ugly cycle.|`|XDUMtGtOaa	Your question is a specific rather than general categorical. "In Every Human." I therefor only need to provide one instance of "no" to answer the entire question with "no".<br>  <br>  I do not seek revenge. I learned long ago that by doing harm to others - whatever the motivation - you are doing harm to yourself. When someone does me wrong, I do my best to seek a resolution, but I do not seek retribution, even if it can not be resolved. People are prone to error and I forgive them even if they are unrepentant, because chances are they're just scared and confused inside, and I can empathize with that.<br>  <br>  So, at least a single instance has been found to counter your categorical statement and the answer is therefor a logical "Not True".|`|92becd68415a1caf52f5b342308b12a0aa	No.  Things have to stop at some point. Can you imagine what kind of world it would be, if every single person decided to get back at everyone that did something to him or her?  Trust God that he will put everything on its place.|`|z7gDM30naa	Revenge is another way to bring back your humiliation. To empower someone who empowered you. Revenge is not "sweet" this is stated wrong.|`|zhGmKzP8aa	It's one of our basic instincts so yes.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	No.  It's a desire and feeling to want to right what's wronged one.<br>  <br>  Take the high road:  move on to other things that are beneficial to one's sense of self, peacefulness, happiness,  and contentment. One will be foolish seeking revenge instead of what I mention above.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone else Steal your happiness, contentment, goodness, kindness.  One's life will best benefit this way.<br>  <br>  |`|OUbNSXjJaa	Time does everything. It is time that plays with the destiny of people.<br>  <br>  We can take revenge against our own self and also we can try to take revenge with time.|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Agent S -<br>  <br>  Even if a need is defined as something present but not necessarily acted upon, I personally don't believe revenge is an inherent need.  Also, I don't believe it is an emotion; I think it can be an emotion-driven event.  Like most, I've been done wrong during my life.  I've not felt the need to get revenge.  My belief is that if I took revenge, I would be as guilty as the person who visited a wrong upon me.  <br>  I have confronted people who I felt did me wrong and that was enough for me.  I doubt I'm unique in this regard.<br>  <br>  good luck <br>   |`|pvWua3CMaa	yeah it is a basic instinct in every animal to take revenge<br>  just like to every action there is equal and opposite reaction (newton's 3rd law) , so naturally every inanimate as well as living beings tend to react the same way... which we call it as revenge...|`|8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	Revenge is the manifestation of ego. Animals are instinctive rather than egoistic. However, there is some trace of ego even in animals.....  therefore an animal taking revenge may be a very rare event, but not impossible.|`|ykDzaFGBaa	No - Manifesting the ability to overcome the need for revenge and finding the positive path towards a cathartic avenue of transcendance is the real inherent need in all humans.

05e0c89d259c567203ac41de8d961e11aa	Lol Pippa...I love your answer and I 100% agree with it.<br>  <br>  Anyways, it is WAY too cliched...<br>  <br>  But, you could say that it is representative of Bella and Edward's "relationship" (and I use that term very loosely). Basically, Bella, the lamb, puts herself in danger by isolating herself with a predator, the lion (although I don't think lions eat lambs, the last ime I checked my biology book). The lamb represents a follower, one who never leads (perfect for an anti-feminist Bella) and the lion a vicious predator (although Edward is kind of pathetic).<br>  <br>  ~Zara Sahana|`|ODMCAcPDaa	Well I guess I'd like to know what type of response you're looking for.|`|teLpS5qpaa	I would do something like...<br>  <br>  This was an attempt at being romantic, but it came out extremely corny.<br>  |`|ghtSITHqaa	I think the author was right on with this quote! A lamb is very gentle and a lion is fierce and strong! Although a lion would not be quick to protect the lamb in a tense situation the lion is willing to fight. And the lamb is shy and timid so all in all I think this is a good representation of the way he is with her. (For the show tonight i am painting my pants and putting on my right thigh "Stupid" and on my left Shin "Lamb") IM OBSSESSED WITH THESE BOOKS!!!!|`|AA11310070	I'm not exactly sure what kind of response that you mean-- but Bella is right.  she was stupid for falling in love with edward, because he's so dangerous.  However, I don't agree with the lion part.  As far as I'm aware, lions don't have an obsession with eating lambs:  they don't NEED lambs, they need some sort of animal, yes, but lambs aren't special.  Bella is very special to edward in the love part, and in the fact that (according to the Voltori or however u spell it) she is his singer.<br>  <br>  I suppose it's the best that Meyer could do, there is nothing to describe the relationship that Bella and Edward have, but the lion is not a good representation of Edward.|`|z8s6xNLCaa	I think this means that the lion is so desperate that he would fall for anyone including a lamb. I think the lion will say he loves the lamb then eat it for dinner! :)|`|HeyxOJAMaa	Bella, being the lamb, is stupid for falling in love with Edward. She could easily get hurt by him yet shes completely crazy about him. Edward being the lion, knows that it is wrong for him to love Bella. He knows he shouldn't continue letting them be together because it is so dangerous. <br>  One slight movement could kill Bella. If he isn't extremely careful he could hurt her. He believes he is selfish because he is lettting this forbidden love continue.<br>  |`|dY8GHHzMaa	i love this quote... edward is described as a lion(fast and strong)  bella is a lamb because she is a helpless human... edward thinks he is sick because he doesn't want to hurt bella and he thinks falling in love with her is wrong... she should live a normal life with another human not a vampire!!! i would personally take edward over any boy and day!!!|`|6Ggza7qSaa	basically theyre saying that the lion (meaning edward) fell in love with bella (the lamb). a lamb is usually the afternoon snack for a lion. dont you think it would be stupid if some lamb (smokin who knows what) walks up to a lion and falls in love with him? thats what i thought. bella was kinda an idiot to fall for him but in the end it all worked out anyways so no harm done.|`|shn49NDaaa	the lion is edward the lamb is bella, and usually the lions eat lamb like edward and bella, but instead the lion falls in love with the lamb
Mgg5vcdOaa	I'm still learning but sounds like it to me.  I love the poem.  Someone once asked me what would happen if I just let it out.

XvO4iLk0aa	G Greed is a life condition like the other nine from hell to enlightenment. They cannot be escaped, they can be chosen. The way to build that ability is to use the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

They want the love, the attention, the events that fill their minds with all the experiences they need to grow.<br>  <br>  They don't have a choice of ethics--all babies act the same way. It is human nature to cry when your diapers are full, when you feel sick, when your need for attention is being ignored.<br>  <br>  But when a human matures he/she must begin to learn that one may only be greedy for the things one has earned or to which he/she is entitled by virtue (not by government decree or by wishing for it or by cheating and thievery.)<br>  <br>  Steve Jobs is greedy. Oprah is greedy. But such people are greedy only for what is rightfully theirs. Bernie Madoff on the other hand was covetous of the property (capital) of other people.|`|BS2dgOIWaa	You could just call it need-fulfillment. At a certain point our desire to fulfill our needs encroaches on another's and it is at that moment that it is called greed. Our drive to survie is so strong that we can't avoid being "greedy" from time to time.<br>  <br>  Imagine you and I are both starving to death and you have a roll.<br>  I steal the roll from you and this upsets you.<br>  But which one of us is greedy?<br>  You for wanting the roll, or me for wanting the roll?<br>  We both want to survive, so neither one of us is actually greedy.<br>  Only the person with his needs fulfilled will be perceived as greedy.<br>  <br>  By the way, people that accumulate massive stockpiles of wealth are still just fulfilling their needs. Everyone has a desire for safty and security, and wealth provides this. Wealth can help fulfill other needs as well.<br>  <br>  __________<br>  You're being intellectually dishonest Alucardhiryu16.

If you are trying to get what you need, then it is not greed. Also, there is a saying "The end does not justify the means". If you are getting those things by illegal or what other means, and is for your own sake without thinking about others, then that indeed is greed. Babies cry to get what they need because that is the only way they know, unlike us adults that we can find a way or do something to get what we need or want.|`|eZLqnWVhaa	It is a kind of instinct, but it has been warped by our society. For instance, an animal will fight tooth and nail for something it wants, because it needs to to survive, just as a baby needs milk, and so will cry for it. However, we humans have managed to change it into a wanting for material goods, because in this day and age, people are forever developing new things which everyone wants.|`|ezeS9HBNaa	Since the creation, man is greedy. What is greed? to me it is strong desire for more. An overwhelming desire to have more of something such as money than actually needed.

YEfW3vI0aa	It depends on the story. If it is really overdone and lame then yes, it does annoy me.<br>  <br>  But then you can get books that have overdone cliches, but they might have a twist to them which makes them interesting.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Depends. If it's well written I'll tolerant pretty much anything. Having at least some sort of originality in the story helps too.<br>  <br>  To Socrates1944 - I think you're being a little harsh there. Mathematics and Language are completely different. Mathematics doesn't change very much. New formulas and theories, perhaps, but not much else changes. Language, on the other hand, changes all the time. Jargon isn't bad. It makes it easier for those of various professions to communicate what they need to. Slang, while sometimes annoying, will keep happening as long as language keeps changing. Abbreviation of words, like chatspeak for example, I find extremely annoying except when I receive a text with chatspeak. Sometimes it's more trouble to put the entire word there. Cliches will always exist because they are formulas that work. Simple and unoriginal, but they work. I completely agree with you about the basic rules of grammar, though.|`|pPXLkO1Faa	Well, there are really only about seven to twenty basic plotlines for a story, so anyone's story is going to run parallels to another. I don't particularly mind similar plots, but when it gets to the point where it's full of cliche's and things that are far too big to be a coincidence, that's when it gets tiresome. It also depends on the writing style, as with any book.|`|fs9ZjaKmaa	One of the most 'over done' story lines I can think of is the 'epic journey' of Lord of the Rings.. where a lowly farmer/etc becomes important/a wizard/a great warrior  and goes to the castle/kingdom/state fair/whatever and saves the village/kingdom/world.<br>  <br>  It's greatly over done, and yet it's still one of my favorite plot lines to read. I'd actually love to write one some day.<br>  <br>  The reason is that each author brings a new twist to some element, the character, the way the world works, the way magic works.. some little thing. And for those reasons alone (and the fact that the plot line is one people love) are what keeps me coming back.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Depends on the writing style. Some cliches are just classics and make us want to read  them again and again.|`|AVYBazOEaa	It all depends on whether the actual book is good.|`|CTSYw8yaaa	To be indifferent to cliches,jargon,slang,abbreviation of words and ideas<br>  is to be indifferent to the corruption of the English language,and the basic rules of grammar.In my considered opinion,anyone who is <br>  indifferent to the above,should be equally indifferent to the principles of mathematics.
ugiUyhOwaa	It depends on the situation in the book...<br>  <br>  In 1st person PoV, it gives us a clear view of the protagonist's feelings and ideas. But, on contrary, we cannot know what's happening to the other setting in which the main character is not present.<br>  <br>  In 3rd person PoV, we can see what's happening to the other characters aside form the main character. It also gives better descriptions of the seting. But, on contrary, we cannot see through our main character as clear as we do in 1st person PoV.<br>  <br>  But at this moment, I prefer to read in 1st person.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	I like first person the best although sometimes it just wont work for that subject.|`|V962TU2taa	It depends on the story.

It also would cover the thoughts and events of every main character in the novel, rather than following a single narrator and getting their ideas and thoughts on the other characters.<br>  <br>  Also, it provides a wider range of events and happenings in the book, as it covers many people, not just the main character.<br>  <br>  I hope my opinion helps you!|`|3a16a10b2d1646576de2efa56252ca50aa	I prefer reading books written in 3rd person, because it gives the writer a lot more flexibility with how the story is told. Ironically enough, I've written my first book in 1st person even though it's not how I started it. I'm still not sure whether to keep it in 1st, but it kind of wrote itself that way. Both ways can be done very well, but I think that 1st person is much more limiting.|`|ee14e206dbb372dcb6ac973cd2828e69aa	I prefer 1st person.

R2T8768Zaa	Ok I'm not the greatest at solos, and I'm assuming you're playing guitar and not piano...just assuming. But when I make solos, I try not to use too many hammer on and pull offs, a lot of artists do though. I just personally find it can become a bit excessive and a little annoying. Something to think about.  When you're writing it, just try to keep it in the key of the song. You have you're intro already so just build on it with the same creativity you used to write the intro. It helps if you know your scales. I was lost until I discovered my scales. Ultimate-guitar.com has some good tips on how to practice your scales, maybe you could check them out and see if you come up with anything.    Good luck!

SBjV8GlFaa	Very well said. So much has been done over the last 100 years! I wish I could be around in the next 50 to 100 years!! I have always loved the future, and would love to see the outcome! Hopefully they will find cures for cancer etc., as they are nearly there now. But sadly the big companies hold out to see how much money they will make from the drugs etc. Sadly, this is one of the failures of our modern times, where as in the early times it was an honor to have invented something. People lived for the glory and recognition, not so much the money. But there is still a lot of things that will be invented and cures will be found, as man is always craving for the unknown. If you are a young person, I am envious of you, as you will see a lot of new wonderful things. Unfortunatley I also think there will be a lot of senseless wars. But again this is human nature.

gUr8xMskaa	I like the subject, mushrooms, on right of photo.  However, I think there isn't much to look at on the left side other than that mound of white ???, which is still not much to look at.  Your off focused strip above is too much and it's giving me a headache looking at the photo.  I recommend doing a off center closeup of the mushrooms with minimal off focus showing from the sides.  Nevertheless, great subject.|`|7PX41rL4aa	Too much of it is out of focus.|`|22fca0784b8657563e32d64aab1fae2faa	Like the others said, there's too much in the photo that is out of focus. Perhaps do a macro shot of your subject and allow it to take up more of your photo.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	1 out of 5    Boring subject/composition, there is a bad color cast as well.|`|lebSL2yaaa	It's too "busy".  If your intent is to show the brown mushrooms, you might either move in closer or crop that part of the picture to eliminate the extraneous stuff on the left side.
t8xFyCt0aa	1. I would consider it a plot hole if you avoided it completely.<br>  <br>  2. Stealing is not the worst message you can send to young readers. I suggest asking the seediest poorest kids you know about stealing (in a nice non-offensive way). Crimethinc.org has tips on stealing if you want to do a little digging on your own.<br>  <br>  Overall I think you should check out the manga Fushigi Yugi. It is a comic book that begins almost the same way as your story.|`|J8xRVPulaa	1) Go into it a little bit, make sure there is a story behind it, but you don't have to document it's entire history.<br>  <br>  2) I think she should find it in the bookstore, and the owner refuses to give it ot her. Then she sneaks in and steals it out of curiosity, but tries to give it back. The owner should then let her keep it, out of good will or something.|`|AN02OYPlaa	(1) Would it be fine if i don't further explain why the book has magic and where it originally came from and why it does wonders? or would avoiding that would be considered a plot hole?<br>  Eventually, I think you'll have to go into some detail about it, or it would be considered a plot hole. <br>  <br>  (2) And can someone help me think of a way the book would end up in Stella's hand other than her stealing it. Im really considering her stealing it but isnt that a bad message to send to young readers?<br>  Who's your audience? If you're writing for preteens, teenagers, etc. I think you'll be fine haha. If you're writing for an even younger audience, then I can understand why you wouldn't want her to steal it. Be realistic about it though. Why would she steal it? It has to fit her character, but I'm assuming you already know that. Another way the book ends up in her hand could be someone magical gives it to her haha. I'm not really sure though. Stealing would probably be the easiest way. if you think about it long enough though, maybe you'll find another way for her to get it other than stealing.|`|DqUCfqYIaa	1- I think that you need to go into more detail about why the book is magical. Is it spells? Does it show you things... This needs to be clarified. <br>  2- What is her character? Sweet and innocent? or the complete opposite. If you don't want her stealing it, maybe you could say that the book is drawn to her. She had found it for a reason. If it is magical then it might be able to appear out of no where.|`|lh0dihm1aa	Being a creative writing major, these questions are pretty easy to answer. ;)<br>  <br>  1. There is no reason to explain WHY the book has magical components. It also doesn't matter where it came from and why it does wonders. How would your main character know anyway? How would she find out? These details aren't significant. You've already explained that the store owner doesn't know, it doesn't matter. <br>  <br>  2. Stealing is a common way for stories to go. If the store owner thinks it was just placed there, maybe he'll just sell it to her for a dollar or something. Or maybe give it to her.

At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, it’s just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why.

AxSX61eoaa	Well Rosalie's real last name was Hale. Jasper's last name is probably Hale so its not incest because each Hale dates a Cullen.  Just a guess though.|`|tvE4L8XJaa	first of all, they have a similar blonde hair so it looks more like they are siblings... and besides... if they all have different names... then it wouldn't be somewhat like an adopted family...|`|uIfbWdsvaa	i dont know tht was kind of stupid on steph meyers part i think i could never understand why she would do tht, but if u think of it they both were around the same era, even tho i believe rose was atleast 100 years older rite because jasper is really old cuz hes from the civil war and rose is probably in the late 1800s early 1900s, so theres probably common names then, and were they both from the soutn bcuz tht can be y too.    but the person above me is wrong because thereadopted last names are  cullen, there real last names are hale.. so shes wrong about tht one lol, no one knows there real last names.. but it is weird tht they both had hales.|`|wU0c3i7baa	Jasper's human name was Jasper Whitlock and Rosalie's human name was Rosalie Hale.     This Q & A with Stephenie Meyer should satisfactorily explain:    Q:  I understand that Rosalie likes to keep her own last name.  But why would Jasper take Hale as a last name - and even further - why do they pretend to be actual brother and sister?  Why dont they just say they, too, were adopted individually?    S.M:  About Jasper using the name Haleits just for convenience.  He and Rosalie look a lot alike.  They actually look like fraternal twinsboth the same color blond, both tall, him muscular and her statuesque (with the same pale skin, gold eyes and flawless beauty, of course).  The Cullens use many different subterfuges to try to keep people from looking too closely at them.  Anything that seems to be a certain waylike Rosalie and Jasper seeming to be relatedthey embrace.  They work within peoples expectations.  People assume the two blonds are related, so they let that assumption stand.  Plus, the more complicated a story is, the quicker someone gets bored trying to understand it, and gives up.     They dont always use the same story.  When it was just Carlisle and Edward, Edward pretended to be the young brother of Carlisles deceased wife.  Then, after Esme, Edward was again Carlisles wifes younger brother (only this time, the wife was alive).  As the family got bigger, the explanations got more complex. Eventually, the Cullens home came to look like a refuge for troubled teens.  (Though the best-behaved troubled teens ever).     They could be Whitlocks, it wouldnt make any difference to anyone accept Rosalie.  Jasper doesnt care what anyone calls him.  But Rosalie clings to her human past with all ten fingers.|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Probably because they are living together...  and they just took it from one another.
qDYzdz5daa	Go grab everything you can by Neil Gaiman.    "Stardust" has been a movie (but the book is better).  "Coraline" is about to be released as a movie.  "Neverwhere" was a TV show (but the book is better)    and there's also some more that should be movies, like    "Anansi Boys"  "The Graveyard Book"  "Interworld"  "American Gods"  "Good Omens"    He also wrote one of the greatest comic books of all time, a giant 75-issue series called "Sandman."  It's NOT a kiddie comic book.   In fact, it may be a little too 'mature' for a 15-year-old, (there's nudity and sex and blood and guts and such) but it really is an awesome read.|`|uX09rPGlaa	Harry Potter, Narnia, Anne of Green Gables|`|CecQFtDvaa	the red necklace by sally gardner GREAT BOOK im 14 i read it and i love it!! def my fav book :) besides twilight|`|ubQ1DmC0aa	Twilight is totally AWESOME  i love mystery books for teens and i read these books by sophie mckenzie called "blood ties" and "girl,missing" they are fab ad you HAVE to read them|`|x3o7cO7uaa	I LOVED the Twilight Series and i liked the Host, Marley and Me is really good and there is a movie on it, Midnight sun is coming out soon ,  Ann Rice has a good Series, I like Vampire Knight as well,  Hope this helps.

GNtWomekaa	It's everything, but not too corny.<br>  <br>  When you say "were" that would be used in a sentence like "we WERE going to school, then we decided not to."<br>  You should be writing it like "we're". Its shortened from "we are".<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  "THEIR building an army" would be used in this sentence, "their dog died"<br>  But in your sentence it should be "they're". it's shortened from "they are".<br>  <br>  Well done with that, that's exactly the type of book i would be reading. It's well written, well done!|`|Ys47rcdkaa	First of all, it's "they're" not "their". Secondly, it's "we're" not "were". <br>  Besides, it sounds like some cheap twist off of Twilight.|`|onkUcy19aa	Depending on how you will proceed with these dialogues, it could either be romantic, cool or just corny! So, continue with good dialogues that do not just babble, but tell. Remember, "Less is more!" <br>  <br>  Make your story so evocative that the reader could almost smell the characters, see distinctly the fabric of the clothes being worn, and feel the overall flow of the event.

The narration is done in third person omniscient, which is a bit unusual and therefore very interesting.

I can only handle reading about 100 pages at a time, and it's very long winded (1000 pages), but it's well written and fast paced. Some scenes aren't fun at all to read, but most of the book is enjoyable so far. I'm on page 398.<br>  <br>  Dragonflight - Anne McCaffrey. This one is interesting. It is just as great as the other books of hers that I've read.<br>  <br>  Magician's Guild - Trudi Canavan. This one is also interesting, but it's taking me longer than normal to read. That's probably due to me reading Pillars of the Earth, though. <br>  <br>  Arabian Nights. It is interesting, but I haven't picked the book up in weeks. I'll finish reading it eventually.

rE5JEJ92aa	okay your link does not work at all but Im assuming that your trying to get your splits right? <br>  <br>  First off, it takes way more than a month to achieve flexibility. it's tricky because one day your muscles will feel really loose and bendy and the next day they'll just tighten up on you and wont want to stretch at all! It's gonna take you about six months of consistent stretching. if you can do that then you'll be good.<br>  <br>  secondly, its good that your starting now. your late but fourteen is still a good age. but just be consistent though.<br>  <br>  third, do not over stretch your muscles. try taking breaks by stretching every other day. hold your splits for five minutes each, nothing more than that.<br>  <br>  happy painful stretching!|`|SsAxq5z9aa	page 403'd<br>  <br>  better luck next time.|`|fZgwb1rqaa	if it's the splits, some bodies will never be able to do the splits. it's just the way they're built. <br>  <br>  but just make sure you let your body and your muscles rest! otherwise they will just tear and never recover.

HxXduL1maa	On December 2 1851, followers of President Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's nephew) broke up the Legislative Assembly and established a dictatorship. A year later, Louis Bonaparte proclaimed himself Emperor Napoleon III.<br>  <br>  Marx wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon between December 1851 and March 1852. The "Eighteenth Brumaire" refers to November 9, 1799 in the French Revolutionary Calendar — the day the first Napoleon Bonaparte had made himself dictator by a coup d'etat. <br>  <br>  In this work Marx traces how the conflict of different social interests manifest themselves in the complex web of political struggles, and in particular the contradictory relationships between the outer form of a struggle and its real social content. The proletariat of Paris was at this time too inexperienced to win power, but the experiences of 1848-51 would prove invaluable for the successful workers' revolution of 1871.

When is this set? What's his family like? How 'common' is he? What upbringing does he have? how nice is he?     Whilst some of these questions may not be important, consider naming your character as this - you are not finding out the name of a person, you are seeing a person with no name and slapping one on yourself.    It'll come to you, just make sure it suits their personality.|`|fwoj4VIFaa	I honestly dont like how fantasy novels come up with strange unreadable names for the protagonists. So, please be careful with how strange your names will be. And is he American? Or partially has another nationality?   I suggest maybe Savumand?   If he's partially not american, maybe look for a name that is related to that side. If Russian, look for a Russian name. Readers like names that does have a history and a background. Arkadi? Artur? Illarion maybe?  And so on. If you like to check some names of various origins, go to http://www.behindthename.com/    It will be a great help.

But the fact that I am here means that I saw something in becoming a human that was an advancement over the pre-mortal spiritual state.    I chose to become human.  That's why I'm here.  Ooops!  Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time! :-)    Oh well, I guess I better make the best of that decision.  Being a human is the most difficult thing I've ever done, but I'm sure the struggle to rise will be worth it in the end.      One more thing... If I was a beam of sunshine, could I choose to gather more sunlight to myself?  But as a human, I can choose whether to sunbathe or to sit in shadow... I can even use my mind and hands to create things that can draw even more light to myself.  Humans have more free-will than sunbeams.  I guess that means I would rather be a human.    It's only up from here.  God gave us the chance to become humans for a reason.  It was so we could learn to become like Him - loving, wise and free.  Life is a learning experience - a great blessing.|`|T1beLIQqaa	From my understanding, spirits lose the physical sensations of touch and taste-those requiring actual physical contact. I would miss that very much, especially the way a woman's body feels, or the taste of a good meal.I  could easily forget about pain. On the other hand, smell, sight, and hearing apparently remain in tact. Time is different in the spirit world. All you have to do is think about where you want to be and you will be there. We are free of all constaints of the physical body, especially pain and ageing- neither exists in the spirit world. In all, I would have to say, the spirit world, but I would probably possess someone occassionally for those other senses lost-like Cindy Crawford'd husband-Cindy might be in for a few surprises-LOL!!!    Humans were originally spiritual, but became locked in physical bodies because we enjoyed the pleasures of the physical-carnal and gluttony. We lost are way to God and can only find our way back through death of the physical.I believe in reincarnation to perfect our spiritual learning so at some point, we stay permanently in the spiritual form.|`|ZwECcnh1aa	Spirit.

ieCuJVZtaa	Maybe the person who wrote that needs a touch of realism instead of pushing out one-liners in an attempt to sound wise.    First off, the suffering of today DOES matter, especially given that in the most general sense of the idea, if you fix something today, it will remain mended until it broken once again. No one can be entirely sure when that fixed something will be broken once more (in fact it may never be broken again for all we know... but this all depends upon what the 'something' is), but what we know NOW is that is IS fixed and presumably for the better of humanity. This 'something' could be poverty, the effects of overpopulation, a widespread epidemic, physically or psychologically violent bigotry, etc. "It is not the suffering of today for which we should be morally concerned" pppshhhh...    To suggest that the suffering of today does not matter because we need to focus on the future is an empty statement that holds weight only in its perceived rhetoric. The person who said that needs to be ******* practical and get their head out of their ***-- in fact, that statement was probably made as an excuse to postpone making some moral decision, or moral deed.    And just to be nit-picky, this person you quoted shouldn't use the word "morally" in either sentence. Its an awkward and redundant adverb to use in the context of each sentence.|`|Z4YSnC3gaa	It is arrogant to assume that we know what is the best interest of upcoming generations. In that same way that I wouldn't assume to know what is in your best interest, we should focus on what it in our best interest when it comes to suffering.    Future generations will decide what is important to them and what isn't and then act accordingly.|`|YvqiIkZCaa	I agree with this statement.    For me, it sums up to the choice that we need to make things right and to choose what is right to ensure that there is a future left for others. It is true that we suffer today but we can choose the right thing which is to stand up and take a stand for the betterment of this world. We choose not to wallow on our present but we choose to save the future.|`|qKW66bo0aa	there is no right or wrong answer -- everything depends on system of morality you accept. still, how one can ignore sufferings of today and claim that they are concerned about future? isn't it an escape-behaviour? if one cares abut something, then they care today and will care tomorrow...|`|YmtNel5haa	What I get from this quote is to not think of ourselves, but of future generations that will have to suffer because of our actions...  I would say that I agree to some extent because it is important to consider the future, but I feel that we should equally address the suffering of today.  I mean really no one should have to go through suffering.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Disagree. We shouldn't be morally concerned about anything. We can and will of course, but SHOULD, never. Morality is a false concept like any other. Why we hold it in such regard I have no idea. Morality can only be decided by you, and you can change your mind at any time.     I assume that excerpt is about global warming which is a hoax. It sounds like I must be part of the bush administration if I say that, but I have looked into it and it IS a hoax.|`|1xcfGHCNaa	Yes, our actions today are definitely going to effect tomorrow. Yet we do need to worry about today in means of doing something, to save our tomorrow.|`|OmJmRmNtaa	As with all things there is a connection.

WaJdOaFKaa	No.  Central composition can be aesthetically pleasing, usually where reflections are also part of the main subject.  I know as photographers, we're sometimes pigeonholed by the rules of composition, or how we think we should compose, but for this particular photo, I think its composition fits well.  I probably would have used a horizontal orientation, as opposed to the vertical, and chose a different angle, but I love the saturation and overall tone - a very well exposed image, and the reflection of the house in the water is quite nice.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	I'd like to see some more space on the left to allow the steps room to breathe.<br>  <br>  However, the shot as a whole and the subject fail to inspire me.

ba2b0c7b7d6c09abcf3a3d6bac39f5e5aa	Reads a bit like a soap opera, just a tad melodramatic (although if that's the intention...). This is dialogue so read it out to yourself; does it sound right? Would people really talk like this? Is it right for the characters and setting? Also if you are a serious writer and you want people to read this with ease then you need to work on your spelling and grammar. <br>  But putting aside my criticism, I found it interesting. I don't know much about Japanese myths but was able to follow this quite well.
sAK1Ghcvaa	The best way to help yourself is to really prepare before going into the audition. Find yourself a song that is in your vocal range and will show off the strengths of your voice. This is key. Practice as much as possible before the audition. This will give you confidence and help you to stand out among the rest. If you have to do a monologue, as well, choose one that is age appropriate. The director has to be able to envision you as the character you are portraying. Practice the monologue as much as you can, too.   Good luck! on your audition. If you go prepared you're bound to do well.|`|7EEV9YHMaa	Bev is right about everything. You have to prepare. but you have to give them all you have in the audition. i just auditioned for thoroughly Modern Millie for a highschool production. I wanted the part of Millie so badly. I ate, breathed and slept that part. But I had a lot of GOOD competition. I was so scared. But i just gave the directors all i could. that's all i could do. if auditions are not until next week, then practice and prepare all of this week. Do whatever you can. you have not been in theatre for a long time, so it is time to restore what you have been missing. Break a leg. all the Best to you. Hope you score Mimi.|`|KGj1dxhQaa	first, i am totally extremely jealous that you can be in rent.  second, stay chill. run over your lines until you know them without looking and with emotion. if you get to pick your song, pick one that works, not one you think the directors will like. wear something comfortable that makes you feel good. if you're allowed, bring friends- they take your mind off your nerves and are great supporters. stay away from dairy, chocolate, and cold drinks. they don't help your voice. but drink tea or water to avoid your voice cracking or throat from drying out. just have fun with it and don't worry. rent is an amazing show. good luck!
mv9AZTdzaa	It depends on what direction you want to change it in, but here are some books that may make you rethink your outlook on life: <br>  <br>  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Steven Covey<br>  The 7 Habits is a kind of modern classic.  Covey goes beyond cliched advice like "wake up with a smile on your face!" and shows you how to live your life based on your values and principles.  <br>  <br>  Three Cups of Tea - Greg Mortenson<br>  This one is about an American mountain climber who started the Central Asia Institute.  It's a non-profit that helps set up schools and pay teachers in Pakistan.  It will make you re-think how we are approaching the wars in Afghanistan and the Pashtun areas of Pakistan.<br>  <br>  The Art of the Pilgrimage - Cousineau<br>  This book just helps you too see your whole life as a journey. <br>  <br>  How to Change the World - Bornstein<br>  Despite the silly title, this is a great book.  The whole thing is stories about "social entrepreneurs," people who set up organizations that helped fill real needs in other people's lives.  <br>  <br>  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Pirsig<br>  ZAMM is a novel and philosophy book rolled into one.  Its basic question is "What is quality?"

f9lO5MIraa	The atomic bomb was originally developed to bomb Berlin, (Einstein's letter to Roosevelt was written in the context of Hitler)  not the Japanese. The firebombing of Tokyo in spring 45 killed more people than the atom bomb. <br>  <br>  Place yourself in context. You are the US President and can not use the bomb and cost millions of lives, or you can use it and potentially end the war. It is not a good decision, but if you read Paul Fussell "Thank God for the Atomic Bomb" it may be easier to understand. <br>  <br>  The destruction of Japan was caused by Japan. No one else is to blame except the Japanese government that started an aggressive war in the 1930's|`|iJzIIEdfaa	It was unnecessary. <br>  <br>  The Soviet preparations for the invasion of Japan caused the Japanese to draft terms of surrender before the bombs were dropped. Stalin wanted to invade anyway so he ignored the offer when it finally came.|`|HxXduL1maa	The role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and the United States' ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. J. Samuel Walker wrote in an April 2005 overview of recent historiography on the issue, "the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue." Walker noted that "The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States."<br>  <br>  Those who argue in favor of the decision to drop the bombs generally assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties on both sides in the planned invasion of Japan. An initial allied invasion of Kyūshū was set to commence in October 1945. A second invasion of the main Japanese island of Honshū was scheduled for March 1946.<br>  <br>  <br>  Those who argue against the decision to drop the bombs characterize them as inherently immoral, war crimes or, crimes against humanity and/or state terrorism. They may also argue that they were militarily unnecessary, claiming that Japan was going to surrender anyway.<br>  <br>  In my oppinion it was not a necessity but an experiment of USA, which can not be justified. Sooner or Japan was going to loose war.|`|LQKH52TYaa	The bombing of hiroshima was and horrific part of history and should never happen again. It was horrific not only because so many lives were ddestroyedbut the effects of the bomb ;lasted well after it had happened, for instance; people got lleukemiaas an ill-effect of the atom bbombsradiation.<br>  <br>  The options America could have taken would have been to not bomb Hiroshima. An invasion of Hiroshima may have been better to a certain extent because less people may have been killed due to them escaping and hiding from the armies.|`|uzfdgFSxaa	The bombings on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were unfortunate and devestating, but ultimately saved many lives - American and Japanese.  Japan would not have surrendered and they lied to the Japanese public about "winning" the war.  It would have gone on for such a long time if this wasn't done.  Hopefully, it will be a lesson that other leaders will take into consideration before something like this happens again.<br>  <br>  P.S. You might want to check out the documentary, "White Light, Black Rain."  It's about the victims of the bombings and how the Japanese govt treated the survivors.

The traditional route is to get an agent (good luck on that one), find out what they want and start submitting query letters.  This takes lots of time, patience, and thick skin.  Go to your local library and look for books on finding a literary agent.  This tells you what each agency is looking for (childrens, fiction, etc.)  <br>  <br>  I recently self-published my book through iUniverse.

You should start freelancing, but shoot more people. I began my own freelancing business and discovered that photography won't really sell unless you're shooting things people will want to buy such as children/family portraits or wedding photography. I would advise getting started with this by shooting more people. There is a whole new realm of considerations when shooting people, and this is the stuff that sells.

ksUksniqaa	I found Near Death Experiences (NDE) to be very different from fainting, falling, blacking out, going under anesthesia, forgetting days.  That is all I have to look into when considering your question.<br>  <br>  It did not matter if I was dead or alive, I dove through a tunnel of faces faster than any amusement ride I'd ever been on. Then, I was upon a hill standing by a tree, which I have come to believe is the Tree of Life. Just one step forward was the light. I went in, and experienced such complete love, joy, acceptance, happiness, encouragement, forgiveness, more love... I don't know how long I was in this NDE, but when brought back, I felt as if it tumbled through the tunnel of faces, and fell into my body. I was dizzy, and not happy that I had been brought back. Had I been alone, would I have stayed "gone" until the physical body died, and then stayed on forever, I don't know. I have tried to return, but it is not my time, though the "Light" has been close on several occasions. <br>  <br>  I lost my mom a few days ago; she ended in a coma. That is nothing like dying, which is what she did a few hours later.   It took a couple of days for her to reveal herself to me, unlike my father who showed himself within 10 minutes of his death.  <br>  <br>  With these experiences as my basis, and one other in which I did literally open my eyes wondering if I was dead or alive, I come back to your question. <br>  <br>  Unconscious - no I did not come to wondering if I were dead or alive. I knew I was alive.<br>  NDE - I definitely did not know if I were dead or alive; the physical reactions of my human body told me I was alive.<br>  Meditation -  in which I could even take a needle in my neck to put a steroid into the herniated disks -- alive.   <br>  Deep meditation - very much like NDE - confusion as to my status.       t|`|FHzAahLOaa	i don't think so.  i think it's just that you don't know what's happening all around you, not necessarily mean that you fall over and "die"|`|hJLHnGWBaa	when you are unconscious you can't think; so NO!|`|WvqRJow1aa	When unconscious, one does not think.

1l74hQL3aa	Clearly he is a man that has achieved his potential, the same potential that is within all of us, that is to get in touch with our own conscience and see that it is the consciousness of the universe.  His story is somewhat subjective based on the language he has learnt as a child, and much on his upbringing and the culture he was brought up in.  But the understanding be brings to his book is marvelous and written in a manner that all can follow.  He is a beacon of light to others that shows our potential to get in touch, not only with ourselves but the universe as well.   Whether you choose to call this consciousness and wisdom GOD, is his choice, it is his God.  Just as if you were to experience the same - this would become your god.<br>  <br>  The similarity to His story and my own, is that in my darkest hour of need I asked a question and got an answer.  Not having the resources to write a book, but if I did, then that would have been the book I would have wanted to write!!<br>  <br>  It also confirmed my suspiscion that the 'MID LIFE CRISIS' that we all experience is a unique opportunity to ask the really important questions about everything, but old enough and patient enough to wait for the answers.<br>  <br>  Everything in the universe has 'function and potential'.

A young, country school-teacher in 1960s Ireland, she spends her life looking after her philandering husband, Oliver, and her pious mother, Maggie. When Cara's seventh wedding anniversary reveals her husband's latest infidelity, Cara decides it's time to do something for herself. Offered the chance to escape her loveless marriage for a few weeks by accompanying her parents to a family wedding in Lake Savannah, upstate New York, she's only too keen to accept. The gorgeous scenery and the relaxed, American approach to life make Cara more aware than ever of how narrow and unfulfilling her life in Tullamore has become. When she meets Jameson Carroll, a reclusive artist who lives with his young son on the shores of the lake, Cara embarks on a once-in-a-lifetime passionate affair. Yet in the background, her return to Ireland and life with Oliver looms. Can Cara Gayle find the courage, at long last, to finally please herself?|`|uv48B1Graa	Probably the same as everyone else's, A Walk to Remember.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Are you a lover of German opera?  My first thought is of the Wagnerian opera, "Tristan und Isolde" (1859), and my second thought is of the 2006 film, produced by Kevin Reynolds, "Tristan and Isolde".  In both the film and the opera, both Tristan and Isolde each drink from a love potion meant for Isolde and King Marke and thus become star-crossed lovers. Geoffrey Chaucer also penned "The Romance of Tristan and Iseult"--the source of the English pejorative, "panderer" (a sexual procurer).    Before you decide on naming your son Tristan, listen to the opera and rent the video, so you will know the literary background for this given name.  Although the tale of Tristan and Isolde is one of the more famous love stories to come from Arthurian legend, it's hard to explain to a snickering middle-school student.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	One of my best friends husband's name is Tristan.

Vd1OzUO8aa	If I recall, the first real 'nation'-state was France and this was formed after the French Revolution, around 1790-1800.  Before that, the concept of being a person specifically of a nation didn't really exist.  You wouldn't really have any close connection to the other common people of your country.  Like the French of the north and the French of the south would have different cultures, language styles and such things like that.  Napolean was one of the first rulers to come in and standardize everything.  Like he brought in the metric system for instance, so that every size would be the same no matter where you went in the country.  Before him, a barrel/cask measurement known as the puncheon could weight anywhere from 70 to 120 gallons depending on where you went.<br>  <br>  However, in this age too there was also a shift from rural to urban living.  The gathering populations in the cities began to upset the fuedal order, because really they were above it.  The merchants, traders, and bankers of the cities were freemen and actually didn't ultimately owe allegiance to the king.  Something new had to be developed, otherwise these free people of the the cities would eventually upset the kingdom.  Thus, instead of a large rural framework of baronies and dutchies, the city became the center of the emerging kingdoms.|`|nnkeYZqZaa	<a href="http://answeringall.mooretolife.net" rel="nofollow">http://answeringall.mooretolife.net</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|M9pwlsVbaa	wasnt that period the fedual era? cuz if it was then that means that the european rulers wanted their nation-states to be able to have an alliance with other nation-states and especially get connected with the influential Pope and have his support if war were to break out. it was sort of a lord-vassal system thing i guess.

And Vasatl almost wins and everything seems to be lost but then you somehow make it work out so it would end happily.   Having it end with tragedy so Pandma would have to marry Rajarshi would be a good ending too if you put a lot of detail into the sadness and how she still loves the garden tender.   You could also have it so that the king finds out and captures them. He's about to execute one but somehow the other comes through and they end up escaping.    I would go into more detail but this is your story and it's already great so I don't want to take anything away from it.    Beautiful story! I love the names, too.

7EEV9YHMaa	It's a really good show about life. The time frame is in the mid-seventies. There are these hopeful auditionees who are auditioning to be in a chorus line for a broadway show. The director, Zack is casting them, but instead of just using their talent to deliberate, he is asking them about their lives. Personal questions about their past. there are a lot of montages about each persons life and past situations. There is a lot of dancing and catchy number. But it is not your typical musical. i hope you will enjoy it. One of my good friends is the understudy on broadway, so I am very excited that you are going to see it. Oh. One more thing, Zak's ex-girlfriend is also trying out for a part in the chorus, but is an outstanding dancer and doesn't know how to blend in with a chorus. So that is also on his list of decisions. Enjoy!
ceBTTCPwaa	"The Raven" is a narrative poem by the American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in January 1845. It is noted for its musicality, stylized language, and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow descent into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. The raven, sitting on a bust of Pallas, seems to further instigate his distress with its constant repetition of the word "Nevermore". The poem makes use of a number of folk and classical references.    Poe claimed to have written the poem very logically and methodically. His intention was to create a poem that would appeal to both critical and popular tastes, as he explains in his 1846 follow-up essay "The Philosophy of Composition". The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the novel Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty by Charles Dickens. Poe borrows the complex rhythm and meter of Elizabeth Barrett's poem "Lady Geraldine's Courtship".    The first publication of "The Raven" on January 29, 1845, in the New York Evening Mirror made Poe widely popular in his lifetime. The poem was soon reprinted, parodied, and illustrated. Although critical opinion is divided as to its status, it remains one of the most famous poems ever written.    http://www.bookrags.com/The_Raven : Includes The Raven summary, character analysis, themes, style, historical context, critical overview, essays, media adaptations, compare and contrast, topics for further study, and sources.    http://www.poedecoder.com/essays/raven/    http://www.archive.org/details/ravenwith...    http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guide...    http://tomsoni.com/media/Raven.wmv|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Here is a link on best of the web for the raven.

Drag that layer ontop of your picture you want to "Sand-er-ize" :P    select the shape you want to add sand to, press ctrl i to invert. then delete the surrounding area.     Go to the layer box, and where it says NORMAL in the drop down box, change that to overlay.    Then go to the layer on the bottom (the original picture) and adjust the selected area (the sand) and desaturated it to black & white.    You may have to play with the transparency of the sand layer, and the contrast of the gray part of the bottom layer for it to look right.      Hope this helps :  If you still have trouble, email me the pic and I'll do it for you .

73t4ijBDaa	This is not much more than a bunch of over done hype.  The date is the end of the solar calendar. This is not the first time it has been done or will it be the last. The last solstice/galactic center alignment took place some 13,000 odd years ago. This date is is only significant because of the time between alignments, just imagine if this same hysteria happened every new years eve, when the end of our yearly calendar ends.|`|igI5yX0vaa	Which scientists believe that and what science are they in?

It's not like I 'dismiss' that opinion, but I think the chances are 1 in 1 000 000!    P.S. My opinion :)|`|hvJQSUOQaa	Hm, I heard apocalypse. Either way I don't believe it though.  The mayans have no proof. I don't believe in prophecy or religion.|`|hat60KYXaa	"Scientist[s] believe this will be the day of Armageddon."     It's a Mayan religious belief, and isn't gonna happen. There is no science that suggests the world will end in 2012 unless the US, Russia, India, and all the other nuclear countries start bombing each other.    Also, technically 2012 has already passed, because they miscalculated the birth date of Jesus by 4 years.  Hence he is listed as being born in 4 "BC", so it's already 2013 baby!|`|qDYzdz5daa	It's garbage.    Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012."     (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    The hoaxters chose 12212012 because of numerology (which is also garbage) and the repeating and reversal of "12", and also because December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY ancient civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.    There are NO scientists who believe in this 2012 nonsense, so you should take that "scientists believe" out of your question, as it's totally wrong.  If you see somene claiming "scientists" said so, ask for names and degrees, because they either don't exist, or got their "degree" from some mail-in fake "university of pulp paper."|`|YmtNel5haa	This is my personal opinion:  We will be (or about) 3 years older.  and nothing else out of the ordinary will occur.|`|OngBk4Ejaa	http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm this has alot of info..|`|e1AUiH3naa	That's an intersting question but I have to say no.

Do you understand what I mean?|`|G07o0cHPaa	Well the Mayans end their calendar in 2012 because they're predicting the alignment of our galaxy that occurs every 25,800 years.  I think they end their calendars at 2012 because they didn't know what happens after the alignment.  They probably thought the alignment is deadly to the galaxy, but I don't think it is because humans have been around for almost two million years so far and we haven't gone extinct yet and there's been plenty of chances for a galaxy realignment.  As far as the end of the world goes, I believe in the big bang.  And I think the universe ends when the universe expands too fast for itself and rips itself apart and then comes back together again to form the little ball of energy to explode once again.  I think the universe just repeats this cycle over and over.  But for the world, our world will end when a meteor hits it or when the sun dies or if a supervolcano ever erupts.  Our world has cooling and heating processes as well that happen in cycles.  The ice caps of this world melt from the sun and raise the ocean levels which be very disastrous.

The main thing is the Mayan calendar, but if you read about the Mayans, you'll also discover they werent particularly reasonable, they believed in human sacrfice, they would hold ceremonies, select a child, because children were considered to be "pure", cut their chests open while still alive, rip the heart out and offer it to their God.

ceBTTCPwaa	"Annabel Lee" is the last complete poem composed by American author Edgar Allan Poe. Like many of Poe's poems, it explores the theme of the death of a beautiful woman. The narrator, who fell in love with Annabel Lee when they were young, has a love for her so strong that even angels are jealous. He retains his love for her even after her death. There has been debate over who, if anyone, was the inspiration for "Annabel Lee." Though many women have been suggested, Poe's wife Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe is one of the more credible candidates. Written in 1849, it was not published until shortly after Poe's death that same year.<br>  <br>  Like many other Poe poems including "The Raven," "Ulalume," and "To One in Paradise," "Annabel Lee" follows Poe's favorite theme: the death of a beautiful woman, which Poe called "the most poetical topic in the world." Also like women in many other works by Poe, she is struck with illness and marries young. The poem focuses on an ideal love which is unusually strong. In fact, the narrator's actions show that he not only loves Annabel Lee, but he worships her, something he can only do after her death. The narrator admits that he and Annabel Lee were both children when they fell in love, but his explanation that angels murdered her is in itself childish, suggesting he has not grown up much since then. His repetition of this assertion suggests he is trying to rationalize his own excessive feelings of loss.<br>  <br>  Unlike "The Raven," in which the narrator believes he will "nevermore" be reunited with his love, "Annabel Lee" says the two will be together again, as not even demons "can ever dissever" their souls.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Annabel_Lee" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Annabel_Lee</a>|`|2Ko12Elfaa	If a question as basic as, 'What did this poem make you think about?' is work to you, you have problems.|`|cdxEq32Caa	"That the wind came out of the cloud one night,<br>  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee."<br>  <br>  And the last stanza really gets me. <br>  <br>  Its such a haunting poem.

The book is fully illustrated. This Fairy Tale takes place in a Great Forest and tells a sweet (and sometimes sad) story about friendship and greed, Good Fairies and Evil Fairies and how love is greater than fear. Also, concealed in the pages of this story, are the clues to twelve very real and very valuable treasures that are hidden around the continental United States for you to find and keep ...treasures similar to the jeweled Forest Creatures in the Fairy Tale. The treasures are not hidden in remote locations but rather in places accessible to everyone. You might even find one by accident, as you walk across a field or down a street. But none are on private property, and none are buried. Nothing needs to be lifted or moved for you to find them. But they are hidden well. The simple clues do not need any special knowledge to find or decipher. Anyone who can read can discover the exact location of each treasure --just the way one of the characters does in the story. This book is more than a treasure hunt. Enjoy reading it and take time to read it to a child. It will remind you and the child that we have to take care of each other, and take care of the earth. Oh yes --and not to be afraid of the dark. So, as you read and look carefully at the illustrations, if you believe in Fairies, you may find the clues that will lead you to the treasure."<br>  "|`|ahAc1plcaa	It could be The Secrets of Alchemist Darhl.

ceBTTCPwaa	"The Lady or the Tiger?" is a famous short story written by Frank R. Stockton in 1882. Stockton later wrote a continuation of this story, "The Discourager of Hesitancy".<br>  <br>  The semi-barbaric King of an ancient land utilized an unusual form of administering justice for offenders in his kingdom. The offender would be placed in an arena where his only way out would be to go through one of two doors. Behind one door was a beautiful woman hand-picked by the king and behind the other was a fierce tiger. The offender was then asked to pick one of the doors, without knowing what was behind it. If he picked the door with the woman behind it, then he was declared innocent but was also required to marry the woman, regardless of previous marital status. If he picked the door with the tiger behind it, though, then he was deemed guilty and the tiger would rip him to pieces.<br>  <br>  One day the king found that his daughter, the princess, had taken a lover far beneath her station. The king could not allow this and so he threw the offender in prison and set a date for his trial in the arena. On the day of his trial the suitor looked to the princess for some indication of which door to pick. The princess, did, in fact, know which door concealed the woman and which one the tiger, but was faced with a conundrum. If she indicated the door with the tiger, then the man she loved would be killed on the spot; however, if she indicated the door with the lady, her lover would be forced to marry another woman and even though he would be alive she would never be with him again. Finally she does indicate a door, which the suitor then opens.<br>  <br>  At this point the question is posed to the reader, "Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady?". The question is not answered, and is left as a thought experiment regarding human nature.<br>  <br>  From its publication and surprise ending, "The Lady, or the Tiger?" has come into the English language as an expression, meaning an unsolvable problem.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Lady%2C_or_the_Tiger%3F" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Lady%2C_or_t...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/3499/discourager.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/3...</a>

kJ4g1vujaa	We've always lived in houses or huts after the stone age when there were people in caves. Vikings often lived in longhouses.<br>   In Roman times there were insulae, which were like blocks of flats or apartments,|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	A good idea of how people lived in the very distant past is to look at Aboriaginal Australia.  One might also look at American tribes, like the plains indians.<br>  <br>  Originally, man would have been a hunter gatherer.  This meant that he would often have to follow game as it migrated.  In order to do this effectively, permanent structures would not have been viable.  It is more probable that tents may have been uses, or seasonally occupied huts.  Caves were used.  Although cold, it was a constant temperature.  <br>  <br>  Following genetic links, via blood analysis, it was shown that man originated in South Africa and that he originally occupied the coastal regions.  ("Out of Africa" theory.  Also used to explain the "Equatic Ape" Theory).  It is logical that man would therefore occupy caves or simple huts.<br>  <br>  The first structures to be forged into towns and cities, in the were origanally made from mud brick.  Early examples of one story, flat roofed buildings can still be found in Iran and Iraqu.<br>  <br>  The Iron age structures found in Britain and Europe employ round houses using large wooden beams, covered in thatch, in a conical shape, with the side walls being made out of woven branches, covered in mud/straw and dung.  A central fire was used, with a hole in the top acting as a chimney.<br>  <br>  The earliest buildings are caves that have been adapted for temple/burial use in Malta.  Extensive work had been put into smoothing out the walls, hollowing out passages etc.<br>  <br>  After that, you get into more complex structures produced by mediteranian cultures. <br>  <br>  You could probably write a fair sized book on this, so if you want a more precise period or region.......<br>  <br>  Luck

pOGIUJHxaa	The most obvious one is that the storm troopers in Star Wars are named after Nazi storm troopers, a WW2 Nazi paramilitary organisation. Here is the Wikipedia article on them:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteil...</a><br>  <br>  You can use this as a basis to suggest that the Empire can be read as the Nazis, which would make the rebellion the British/ American forces (and I would say Naboo would be France because it is occupied...). Then you just follow the polt through and assign counterparts according to what happened during the war, for example the large "indestructible" Death Star can be seen as a representation of the large "indestructible" german Luftwaffe which were bettered by the technologically inferior, smaller, but quicker British Spitfires, just as the Death Star is bettered by one small fighter plane. <br>  <br>  What you have to remember though is that this could be due to the fact that the war has been made into a good vs evil narrative which pits the "good" Allied forces against the "evil" Nazis (you have to remember that, although the Nazi regime was evil, at the time Britain were still oppressing ethinic groups in their colonies and America was segregating people based on race, so they weren't as "good" as they are subsequently made out to be, plus the war was not a crusade for good, as it is often made out to be, it was only depicted as such once the horrors of the holocaust was fully revealed after the war). In other words, history has been made into a hero narrative, the kind of hero narrative that Lucas used. Therefore, although you can probably find counterparts in Star Wars for lots of things during the war, you need to be careful to recognise that you can probably find counterparts in many other wars and hero stories, real or mythical, since they have all been made to fit into this basic story which Lucas utilises.<br>  <br>  If you want a more detailed account of it, I just found this site, which has a lot more examples and is definately worth a read. If you can't be bothered to read it all, at least scroll to the bottom as it has a list of WW2 references in the newest three films:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/starwarstika/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/starwarstika/</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

In "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs of Experience" Blake interrogates the Christian concept that desire is "evil" and passivity is "good."|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The poems in Songs of Experience, on the other hand, wrestle with issues of what happens when that innocence is lost. "The Tyger" is often paired with the poem called "The Lamb" from Songs of Innocence. The former references the latter and reexamines the themes of "The Lamb" through the lens of experience. "The Lamb" is one of those idyllic poems which asks the Lamb who made "thee" (just like "The Tyger"), praises how soft and cute it is, then tells it that God made it and how wonderful that is. Blake's tone almost seems ironic (i.e., he actually means something very different than what he seems to be saying). Many scholars have argued just that, especially when paired next to his poems about the dangers of religious dogma.<br>  <br>  For a full analysis, I've linked Shmoop's The Tyger|`|a43b06e1adf1175ce38fbc5fc0cff568aa	It has to do with Jesus Christ and Theology. <br>  The poet William Blake was not only a Catholic but also was a Jesuit Priest.

L5S6rpI7aa	As a beginner if you go to wikipedia as one answerer suggested I am sure You would loss your remaining interest for the study of history. Our text books particularly the dry subject as history, students feel bore in capturing the contents.Books are written without taking into consideration the mental set up of the target age groups., as one suggested to a 12 years boy to go to wikipedia for growing interest on history, ridiculous !<br>   History means a chronology of events in the process of progress of human civilisation. So you need to read chapter wise ie, ingredient of history, prehistoric age, Vedic age, Mouryan era, Gupta era and so on....... I mean to sat don't read in shortcut method. not like that,t today you read Gupta era and the next day you read Mahenjo daro civilisation .Try to understand the text as story. select a chapter, read the text carefully, try to answer the question in the exercise on your own language ( answer should not be lengthy), Take 2/3 days to complete a chapter. Without depending on the ready made answer if you can write in your own language, I am sure you would get interest.|`|AA12156890	Read what interest you.|`|DTLGuE81aa	while you're sleeping|`|AA11563787	Hey Arushi:  Good question.  Rather than asking a silly question like when did the War of 1812 occur, you've asked for a way to understand history, which might be the first step towards knowledge and then wisdom.  <br>  <br>  First ask your teacher if there are any overriding themes about the history lessons you're learning.  Then when you're going through the text, you can spot these themes.  Write them down or highlight them in the text so you can refer to them later.  The themes will give you a sense of connection between the different people, places and events.<br>  <br>  The second thing you should do is look for things that are relevant today.  How did things that happened years and years ago impact how things are done today.  Because history should be relevant to the modern day reader.<br>  <br>  A wise man once said that if you don't study history, you're doomed to repeat it.  What he meant was that we should learn from the mistakes of those in the past.  Mark Twain, an American writer, modified that a bit.  He said that history doesn't repeat but it does rhyme.  What do you think he meant by that?<br>  <br>  Good luck, Arushi.  You're on your way to knowledge and hopefully it brings wisdom.|`|Xk9m7W4naa	First listen properly what your teacher is teaching,<br>  then understand the topic,<br>  then by-heart the chapter<br>  and then study the 'question and answers'.|`|TuGkVqwraa	Open your high school social science Text Book.|`|hFnUAImYaa	pls listen ur teacher and whenever u have doubts clear it from her.<br>  pls just know the basic concept on which ur reading. if u understand it will be easy for u to read and get good marks.<br>  thank u . all the best. read well.|`|tFDAVV4Eaa	you can first take interest in history wen it is taught by your teacher and then u can read lesson once and understand it and then learn the answers as it is easy. so try it this way.|`|GoL4xMgDaa	just read it like a comic book .<br>  and creates image's for every person,and place.<br>  in your mind.i'll help .|`|e3i07sZBaa	Wikipedia.org
NYU37jfGaa	In 'Women Who Ruled' it says:<br>  <br>  'She was born in Ad 625 and at the age of 13 came as a junior concubine tot he court of T'ang Empeor Tai-tsung, ruler from 627 to 659.  When he died, she was chosen by his heir Kao-tsung (549-684) first as his favored concubine and then in 655 as his empress.<br>  <br>  On her way to ultimate power, she is said to have poisioned one of her own sons, her sister, and her niece, forced another son to hang himself, had 4 grandchildren whipped to death, ordered the execution of 2 stepsons and 16 of their male heirs, killed 4 daughters-in-law, 36 government officials and generals, and ordered another 3,000 families to be slaughtered.  By 660 she had eliminated all her opponents. The emperor was often too ill to attend to affairs of state for months at a time and relied entirely on Wu Hou.  For the last 23 years of his life, the Empress Wu Hou ran the country with consummate ability and efficiency.  Military spending was reduced, the country experienced peace and prosperity, and commerce and agriculture thrived.  When Kao-tsung died in 683, Wu Hou became regent for their son Chung Tsung.  But she had disagreemtns with her new emperor's wife almost immediately, so she deposed her son after only one month and installed her second son Jui Tsung, over whom she had more control.  In 690 she simply usurped the throne for herself, naiming herself 'emperor' and ruled with great wisdom in her own name for 15 years.  Described as self-confident and assertive, she took great pains tn encourage independent thinking and bold behaviour in her children.  So long as she remained strong, no one dared attempt to usurp her pwoer, but swhen she reached the age of 80, her opponents grew more courageous.  She was deposed in a palace coup in Ad 705 and died in retirement ten months later.
TbTO5SXlaa	Your inspiration should  - must - come from within. While there is much to be gained from looking at pictures that use lighting well and are well-composed, what you or I consider a good picture will differ from someone else's.<br>  <br>  Its normal, when you're just getting involved in photography, to imitate other photographers. Over time you'll begin to develop your own unique way of seeing pictures and using composition to show what you want to show.<br>  <br>  I often think that digital photography encourages what I call the "machine gunner mentality" - take 300 pictures and hope a few are good enough to keep. I've lost track of the number of times I've seen people tell beginners to "Just shoot and shoot and shoot." Think about this: If you take 300 bad pictures and have no idea why they are bad, what have you learned? Other than how to take bad pictures.<br>  <br>  I encourage people to develop what I call the "sniper mentality" - one exposure, one good picture. In other words, take time to think about the picture you want to make and how you can make it. Slow down.<br>  <br>  "Pictures are not taken, they are made." Ansel Adams.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	you should be inspired to take good pictures all the time without a site...  the best site is any thing that you can point a camera at.<br>  <br>  You should be able to look at any object and find a way to make it interesting on film or in digital format.<br>  Too many people already take bad pictures<br>  good luck with those good pictures|`|5E5gL9fVaa	depends entirely on your own taste.

AHuBqplbaa	It depends on the story.  If this lord named the castle you should think of what your character would name it.  If it's an old castle, it may already be named and giving the structure a history can help you come up with a name.  Sometimes a castle is named after the family who owns it, sometimes the family that built it, sometimes it's named because of it's appearance rather than after the family name.  It might be named from its history (perhaps it has withstood all attacks on it, perhaps it was once given a name because it was known for torture and death inside its walls)   It could also be named from an old language no longer used.  Castles can have nick names designated by the common people of the land.  This is your story, so you should brainstorm and come up with a suitable name.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	maybe after one of your favorite authors like Castle Asprin or if there are any famous falconers.<br>  or after the king's adviser in Muppet Cinderella Castle Featherstone.<br>  or White Castle, I'm hungry.|`|oExCVlrTaa	Hmm well it would really depend upon the setting of the novel, but some suggestions would be: name it after the noble's family name, Castle Griffin, Griffin Castle, Falcon Castle, Castle Grayhawke.|`|VESGTNzSaa	Pennipotenti means bird in Latin<br>  Rov means prey in swedish<br>  Fekete Ruha means black in Hungarian<br>  Hopea means silver in Finnish<br>  Regnum means kingdom in Latin|`|t8xFyCt0aa	It can be whatever you want.

When rules stifle ideas they are worthless and counterproductive.|`|d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	This is a master thought, it`s my honour to learn and agree. That is all about poetry and it needs a likewise mind to understand and confirm.The writing provides a good insight on poetry and I strongly agreed that writers play with words and it is always a beauty or appreciation. Rhyme in poetry is no fixed rule nevertheless it is a much easy read or appetizer for many. Words,independent of form look easy but need great skill. It is usually difficult to truly understand a master writing due to the free use of words. I usually read it over and over to grasp the feeling .|`|ljzb6fZBaa	Yes, we need diversity for variety's sake, for only then can we enjoy and relish and embrace the colours and energies of life in all its fullness and richness.<br>  <br>  Thanks for sharing the interesting and insightful poem, sister Tori.

ILTkc9Ddaa	Absolutely NO.<br>  <br>  I have read similar book "God Is Not Great" by Christopher Hitchens, in my opinion it has point to be noted; that is we can live socially only by moral education, ethics and laws. We don't have to hanging tightly on religion.<br>  <br>  Related to your question to make the world better place:<br>  --> it's not about the religion, it's about the people.<br>  <br>  Have you seen "The Day The Earth Stood Still" movie starred by Keanu Reeves in 2008? (you can read the story plot on wikipedia, use my 'source' below). It has the idea that to make a better world, all people have to change the way they are thinking. And it will happen only when human race meet the need to change. Then the drastic evolution of human mind will change. Therefore the way we live would be different, for sure to be better.<br>  <br>  Well, currently Human race is not at 'the edge of the cliff' situation. Therefore people of today, won't bother trying their best to change the way we live. In fact, a person like Thomas A.Edison (electric light bulb inventor) make the world better by making the world brighter at night time. <br>  <br>  Everyone has their own vision of better place. War is created by the clash between these visions.<br>  In conclusion, YOU yourself have to work harder to make your own VISION of better place to become REAL. Other than that, the world will be nothing else but today's world.|`|lYkvps54aa	Yeah people seem to be jumping on the anti religion bandwagon more and more now. You know, 'there wouldn't be any war if it wasn't for religion brigade' which is total nonsense, of course. <br>  the fundamentalist would be fighting with each other anyway, whether its about religion or not. these guys want power, nothing more. <br>  <br>  in the early years, it was religion that brought order to Society and the glue that held it together, when there wasn't any governments. And what about the good that has come from religion, nobody wants to talk about that.|`|OIS808Qmaa	Without a doubt - Our minds would be free from pre-assigned beliefs and we'd be left to unravel this mystery of life on our own.  At least we'd be given the chance.  This was not so in the past, because the few had control over the many, and religions were inserted accordingly into the cultures of the world, essentially robbing our minds of the purest form of free thought - which would be to form our own unbiased uninfluenced opinion on why we are here.|`|BYE51aDRaa	yeah possibly. but not religion as a whole. because there's nothing wrong with believing in God/s, people should have their own views.<br>  <br>  but when it comes to the brutlity & harsh treatment of people who:<br>  <br>  A. dont believe the same as you & refuse to conform<br>  or<br>  B. have another religion<br>  <br>  if these aspects of religion were gone, then the world would almost certainly benefit.|`|Z2h74JuZaa	No<br>  Without religion, those people who have nothing except the concept of god to believe in would have nothing<br>  <br>  Religion is somewhat the reason for some peoples existence, its nice to have something to believe in<br>  <br>  However, i don't agree with people not accepting each others religion, or forcing religion on other people. it should be a personal choice, not a chore<br>  <br>  All the best xxx|`|ezeS9HBNaa	Let define religion: People's beliefs and opinions concerning the existence, nature, and worship of a deity or deities and divine involvement in the universe and human life. if religion involve divine, worship, existence and nature meaning that if all religion was gone their is no place to be call  our present day world i.e (The earth)|`|knnKJqyTaa	If all religion was gone would the world be better place ?<br>  I don't think so, because everyone needs to believe in something, it can be luck, it can be religion.

If no one had those beliefs we'd all be athiest. Which in itself is a set of beliefs and therefore a religion! :-)<br>  <br>  I think that without the conventional religions- christian, islam, judism etc, cultures in general would possibly get along better however, there would be no moral codes properly set. Therefore murders and rapes etc would probably go up as no one would care. Depression may be higher, as some people would find life meaningless and hollow.<br>  <br>  Havent read that book sorry.|`|ugiUyhOwaa	I'm not quite sure about that one. I mean, everyone needs to have something to hold on to, which is the role of religion. I think religion becomes a root of evil when he became blinded and does not know anymore if he still doing good things or if he is becoming prouder of himself and thinking that he is 'perfect' because he has a strong faith onto something. It also becomes a root of evil when it creates a divisions among the believers of different religions.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	I haven't read the book but I believe in the quantum physics theory of everyone being their own god and making their own miracles.<br>  religion doesn't matter what matters if what people follow and believe in. Communism renounced religion in China and yet its people blindly followed their "Great leader" through all sorts of atrocities.<br>  If religion disappeared tomorrow there would still be wars and terrorism, just nothing to blame it on but ourselves .|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	ABSOLUTELY! Religion is just a con way to get money out of vunderable idiots|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G If all religion were gone, people would just invent new ones like "The free market will regulate" or "A Ferrari would make me happy."  The problem is not that religion exists. The problem is that religions are based on delusions. The delusions are the real source of the hate and murder created by those who espouse various religions.<br>  Most people also have an innate need to transfer responsibility to an outside agency and to conform to societal norms and our eyes fool us into thinking that our lives are separate, because we can't see the connections..

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Generally speaking, religions have tended to either condemn and support condemnation of people who wish to have their freedoms to speak and believe in different things and want to better themselves. Religions have seemed to cause segregation, wars, violence and has many aspects of brainwashing using tactics to scare people into belief and servitude of a system and cause that persecutes anybody who disagrees.<br>  <br>  Also the fact that religion led to holding back the development of technology and science during the 800 or so years known as the Dark Ages.<br>  <br>  Look at the simple fact of today. Iraq, the Taliban. They are people of this century who still think, believe and operate on medieval views. When I hear their absurd beliefs about virgins in heaven and sacrificing ones life to kill people who choose to believe something else, I can only think that religion is but an evil tool of indoctrination.|`|PFncnta2aa	If every religion is unified and everyone is delusional enough to believe it, and if no one is smart enough to manipulate the crowd using religion for his or her selfish/corrupted reasons, then that will be a better place.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|R75tldc8aa	Generally, Maycomb is racist and contributes to theme of prejudice throughout the novel. In Chapter 9, Atticus speaks to Uncle Jack about "Maycombs usual disease" which is racism, and it is this racism which causes the lynch mob outside the jailhouse by otherwise law-abiding citizens who have become overrun by fear and racism, prompting them to violence and evil. <br>  <br>  Not only Tom Robinson is prejudiced, but also Boo Radley. The treatment of Boo Radley prepares the reader for the prejudice that occurs when we are introduced to Tom Robinson.

Incidentally, a fine pun on 'penned'  and 'boxed...in'.  'I'm free!' when you begin the free verse quatrain continues the pattern of self-reference the poem has already established. In S3 L3 you have an extra beat.  Since the poem speaks of gentle rebellion against formal convention, why would we expect it to be perfect in all detail.  Indeed, if it is rougher, but only a little so, does that not embody the tension between free verse and metrical poetry, a tension inherent in the form itself since it contains both.

Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

pOGIUJHxaa	The Western colonizers got very rich!!<br>  <br>  In Africa the colonizers took all the natural resources (like diamonds, rubber, ivory, etc) and shipped millions of people over to the Americas to sell as slaves for huge profits. In the Americas they used the land for cotton and sugar plantations, and displaced the native peoples in order to use the land for farming. In Australia and other deportation colonies they displaced the native peoples so that they could get rid of "unwanted" people (like "criminals" who were mostly poor, thus leaving the country richer in general). So basically colonization made Western European countries into the global economic powers they still are today. The same applies for countries that broke away from the original colonizing power (like the US). The difference is that the split is internal to the country. While we can compare Western European countries to the African nations they ravaged, in the case of, e.g. the US, we should compare the white ex-colonizers to the black ex-slaves. In other words, colonization always made the colonizer rich.<br>  <br>  However, this needs to be separated from Imperialism, which is a different concept. Colonization came first, but in (predominantly) the 19th century the idea of Imperialism sprung up, which was an ideology based on conquering territory for the sake of creating an Empire. Colonization was based purely on profit, but Imperialism was about ideology. Therefore, while colonization made the colonizers rich, Imperialism didn't necessarily do the same, it just gave them larger territories, which they then mostly relinquished. I would personally say there wasn't much good that came from Imperialism in general, but it took me a 5000 word essay to fully explore this, so I won't go into it here! Lets just say that Imperialism was about superiority, mostly based on ethnicity, so it is at least partially at the root of modern racism.<br>  <br>  On other thing, you are wrong to say that Europe didn't gain territory, there are lands all over the world which are geographically very removed from Europe, but which are part of various European nations, for example, in the Caribbean, Martinique and Guadeloupe are French "departments" (which is basically the French equivalant of counties, so Paris is also a department) and they are treated (in theory) exactly like any department on mainland France. There are also overseas territories, like Gibraltar, etc. Also, in the case of settled colonies like the US, they still have the territory they gained from the native peoples.<br>  <br>  On another note, the formation of new nations is only a benefit for the colonisers who settled, like the Americas and Australia, since the formation of nations in Africa has actually in some cases been very problematic since they are arbitrary lines drawn on a map and not based on tribal/ familial heritage or shared culture, etc. This is one of the issues facing a number of African nations still today, and it all stemmed from colonization!<br>  <br>  This is a very brief and patchy overview, so I would recommend that if you are really interested you start at Wikipedia. Here are a couple of links to get you going:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism</a><br>  <br>  However, the history of colonialism varies greatly depending on the colonizing force, the region in the world that was colonized and the period it happened (today's colonial forces, like China, are very different to 18th century colonial forces, like Britain, but both are different to Spanish colonization which was religion based), so you might want to focus on one specific region or country at a time, and there are so many I will leave you to search on Wikipedia!<br>  <br>  If you have exhausted Wikipedia, try reading "Postcolonialism" by Robert Young - you can get the "short introduction" version on Amazon really cheap second hand, or the "historical introduction" version for a bit more, but it is much better! <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
CMms2lGoaa	Get a publisher OR if you don't want to then try selling it on ebay or craig's list or something. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Blessings,<br>  Bailey|`|MMmv06Ynaa	it would be better if you could find a publisher. you would make more money that way.|`|vPI1hVGUaa	You can sell your book a few ways:<br>  1) Through a publisher<br>  2) Yourself (lots of work)<br>  3) Via an ebook (downloadable book).

You will then miss your book once you sell it.
BBfIXcI0aa	Like anything else, whether or not you like it is going to depend on your preference. It's a true singacle, dancicle musical, and while the story is a lot of fun, the main focus IS on the performance - a good cast makes it, but a bad cast would break it just the same. I saw it recently, and wasn't actually expecting to like it due to who was putting it on, but it was actually a really, really fun, high quality show.<br>  <br>  Rather than getting a ticket right off, I would pick up a copy of the soundtrack, read a plot summary, and see if you're interested.|`|d5SLRSjwaa	Wicked is extremely good...amazing in fact. It's the highest grossing musical and has won 37 awards including three Tonys and a Grammy.

The sets and costumes are absolutely phenomenal. Then again, I'm one of the raving 'Wicked obsessors' [and hopefully after you see the show you'll become one of us]. You really should go see Wicked.|`|ji7WZvC1aa	I'm surprised you haven't had a zillion answers going "OMG YESSS!!!! Wicked is the bestest musical EVAH!!!!" yet, as it does seem to inspire screaming fangirls!  I saw it and I have to admit that it is one of the most visually spectacular shows I have seen (and I've seen a fair few Broadway and West End shows) but once you got past the spectacle, there is not a whole lot to it - it felt quite empty and heartless to me, particularly compared with something like Billy Elliot or The Lion King which are just chock full of heart.  There are some neat tie-ins with the Wizard of Oz, but there are also a couple of things that don't quite tie in properly with that story, which may annoy you!  It's good, yes, but in my opinion not a truly great show.  I wouldn't bother seeing it again - there are so many other shows which I would go to again in a heartbeat but Wicked is not one of them.|`|S8o45CzRaa	Wicked The Musical <br>  Six Drama Desk Award winner "Wicked The Musical" is a must watch for all those who wish to understand the alternative viewpoints!

It is so cleverly done, the way that all of the plots link into one another. I would definatley recommend going to see it! If you don't like the look of it, go and see the Lion King-That's brilliant too!<br>  Hope this Helps! Xxxx|`|ttvA2RUZaa	Yes!!! I saw about 5 musicals in one week when I went to NYC and it was definitely one to remember! It makes you think. Amazing play!

uxVIlXlvaa	its acutally the vice versa that works out better. a guitar through the bass amp. although i dont know what exactly happens, i heard that playing a bass through a guitar amp can mess it up. try looking into it on some bass and guitar forums.|`|xTioPxaVaa	Some tuners will work with a bass.  The really really cheap ones, probably not.  If you plug your bass into it, and it just jumps around on the low E string, then you'll probably need a better tuner.<br>  <br>  Bass through a guitar amp...electrically it will work. However, in order for a bass guitar to be reproduced properly you need power and speaker area.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that your 10 watt amp probably has an 8" speaker in it.  This is totally inadequate to play bass through at anything above "bedroom" levels.  Playing a bass loud through a small guitar amp will, in all likelihood, damage the speaker.  That small speaker was never made to handle the large excursions (back and forth movements) that a bass guitar will generate.<br>  <br>  If you're going to play with a group or ensemble, the minimum wattage I recommend for a bass is 100W, and that's a bare minimum.<br>  <br>  Goo luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|W1h3w5gdaa	I've heard the same thing as Deepy and Ken, that you may damage your amplifier. I would recommend getting a small amp designed for a bass guitar.<br>  <br>  As far as the tuner goes, my $10 electric tuner has a button on it that says "Bass" which I push for tuning my bass. Works great. Go figure. :)
