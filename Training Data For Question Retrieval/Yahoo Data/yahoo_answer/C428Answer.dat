Ulme5ewraa	Well, I don't know if you want this to be a permanent thing or not.  If you want to go with the plexiglas, there are little round plastic tabs that you can buy.  They are meant to go under a glass table top to keep it from sliding around.  It should work the same for plexi.  If you wanted to go permanent I would suggest a pour on lacquer.  You would need a lip on the edges of the table so that it doesn't pour all over the floor.  It's usually two parts that you mix and pour on, kind of like a syrup.  It dries clear like glass.  You may have seen this concept in those tables where people make pictures out of bottle caps and then pour the lacquer over it so the caps appear to be inside the glass.  I have seen it with pictures and postcards in restaurant tables it looks pretty good.  Let me know if you have any other questions or more information.  Good Luck|`|GcWb7IRdaa	just screw on plexi glass or glass then it will just have the pictures under neath and u wouldn't have to use glue or stuff|`|AA10097817	Put the pictures on the table with some double stick tape. Just a little to keep them in place while you put on a real glass top. Have it cut to fit and the edges polished to make it less likely to cut anyone. The real glass won't scratch as easily as plexiglass and it is heavy enough to not have to screw it down.
5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	You can get paints in different sheens, from being totally flat and not shiny to a high-gloss, which would be really shiny. Also, you can always add a bottle of a fine glitter or something along those lines to the can of paint. I would recommend going to Home Depot or Lowes and talking to a paint specialist. They will have ALL kinds of ideas. <br>  Good luck! Sounds like a great idea!|`|D2BSKxREaa	I believe if you go and look at home depot or lowes, they will have anything!

AA12330575	In fact, you may very successfully treat plywood/particle board just as if it was drywall.  Tape the joints with regular drywall tape and mud.  Go over all your joints at least two more times after the first taping dries.  Also cover all fasteners with mud (3 coats).  Sand between coats and when you are done, paint it and no one will ever know it is plywood and not drywall.  I've done this hundreds of times, literally.  I've been a drywall contractor since 1960.  Have fun.|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	Our home was decorated (if you can call it that!) with plywood around the 1930s. In the 1940s, my mother-in-law tried painting it with oil based paint and recollected that it took about 10 coats to cover it up....however, I must say that the job she did was phenomenal and it almost looks like drywall.<br>  <br>  What I would do is use a wood sealer first to prevents the paint from getting sucked up by the bare wood. You'll want to lightly sand the rough spots after the first coat of sealer, then apply a second coat of sealer. After that, you can apply a couple of coats of latex paint. Be sure you counter sink the nails (and fill them in with putty) and caulk the corners and seams before painting :)|`|GcWb7IRdaa	prime it with many coats and do the same for paint it should fill out and appearn smooth|`|fbf036d0bcf69547cc9d92e1f54de8d8aa	Why didn't you just use paneling?

Tide or Gain works good. Also use Downy or other fabric softener in the wash. It takes more than one wash to get the smell out. Usually 2 loads.  The second load I added some baking soda to.I noticed 2 things in this process. One that I couldn't be the one to check if the smell was still there. I thought I smelled smoke on everything. (Your friend will be smelling smoke for months). And two take the clothes out of the washing area. Wherever you wash the clothes will smell like smoke too. Then you will know if the smell is still on the clothes. Some of the clothes smelled like smoke out of the wash, but when dried smelled fine. The smell in the laundry room goes away after all the clothes are cleaned. The cleaners do charge too much. The clothes that I sent to the cleaners were charged more than I paid for them. (We had insurance so I thankfully didn't have to pay the bill.) I hope all goes well for your friend.|`|mLLAimT6aa	I had a house fire before.  What I did to get the smoke smell out was simply wash and wash and wash...It took a while, but eventually the smell was totally gone.

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	What you did was blow a circuit. The blowdryer caused the circuit that outlet is attached to to use too much power than it was made to handle, so it switched itself off for safety. Somewhere in your apartment is a circuit breaker board, full of switches. It is usually in a spot out of the way, but not all that hard to get to. I live in an apt. too, mine is behind a little metal door in the hallway. Just look around and eventually you will find it. It might be in a closet. Open up the door and look at all the switches. They switch side to side, not up and down like a light switch, and should all be facing one direction. The one that blew will be facing the other direction than the rest. Just switch it back and it will be fine. Just be sure you don't have too many things running next time you use your dryer.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	There should be a breaker box in your apartment, behind a small metal door in the wall. It may be in a closet or in the hall or kitchen. Find it and look for the breaker which appears to be in a different position than the others. Flip it towards 'off', then back to 'on'.  If it's an old building and you have a fuse box instead of breakers, check the fuses to see if any are blown--a little copper strip visible through the glass will be broken--and replace that fuse with one of exactly the same amperage. Next time try using the blow dryer in another outlet. If you were using the dryer in the bathroom and it was in a GFCI outlet, which is the kind with a little red button in the middle, try resetting that button. If you continue to blow circuits when you use the dryer, call maintenance.|`|AA10097817	Your apartment should have its own electrical box. Look on every wall including behind doors. Open it and look for a switch that has been tripped. Switch it back "on".<br>  <br>  Or, ask a neighbor.|`|LRX4cfnAaa	To expand on Karen L's comment, the GFCI outlet is sometimes located in a different bathroom or kitchen.  If the problem is not the circuit breaker check for a GFCI outlet near any water source (other bathroom, kitchen sink, or even outside).  You will know a GFCI outlet because it has two buttons, usually between the two receptacle holes where you plug in the appliances.  Happy hunting!!!|`|l342ysWnaa	You need to reset the circuit breaker (looks like a bunch of switches in a metal box on the wall), if you have access to it.  Or if it's an older apartment, there might be fuses.<br>  <br>  It will not come back on by itself.  If you need help, contact a handy neighbor or submit a maintenance request.

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	English Ivy is very prolific and grows quite easily almost anywhere, in any kind of soil no matter how crappy it may be. I used to have so much english ivy on my propery I had to rip it out of the ground by the roots to keep it at bay, and it still kept coming back. You can find english ivy easily at any plant nursery shop, and train the plant to grow on your topiary in no time. Just put the vines where you want them to grow. If they won't stay, you can get some green plastic gardening ties to keep the vines where you want them. If they grow the wrong way, re-direct them the right way. If they get too big and long, just cut them back and they will grow again.|`|NJULnXiyaa	Its pretty hard to kill ivy.

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	You are not a bad tenant for wanting a clean home to live in. If you want to move, now is the best time to do so before you get too settled into the dirty apartment. Let her know you are interested in the one that is being recarpeted before she rents it out to someone else. That way you can live in a cleaner apt, and she can have the dirty one open to do work on it too, if she wants too. Mold can be extremely hazardous to your health and respiratory system, and it is not unheard of for some molds to be so toxic that they eventually cause people to get so sick that they can die. Don't ever put up with mold anywhere in any rental you ever live in. Landlords know that mold is toxic and if they don't deal with it they can have a lawsuit on their hands if you get ill from it. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about what she will think if you ask to switch apartments right now. It's best to do it right away before you get settled in, otherwise if you don't make a big deal out of the nasty carpet, she may think you are OK with it and drag her feet about fixing it. Landlords are great at making promises to fix things. But the proof is in the pudding, so to speak, and I never believe their promises until I see the repairman standing on my doorstep. Get the clean apartment while it's still available.|`|AA10097817	Just move, unless you trust her.|`|F08HDRvraa	Move to the newer apartment.  You are not a bad tenant.

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	I mix concrete "wet" (7-8 slump) and use a 5 gallon bucket to pour it into the cells until full.  Now if this is a long concrete wall order a pump and the appropriate amount of concrete. Most concrete companies can set you up with a pump contractor and with pours of 5 yards or more . . .  it's worth the cost.  Chat mix is the basic pump mix they'll send out which will flow into the cavities nicely.  If you mix this yourself typical concrete bag mix is 3000 psi and that strength is relative to the 5-6 slump.  You won't want this to pour cells and need the  7-8 slump as described above.  Being so, buy the 5000 psi bag mix that's available in most home centers in #80 bags; this will give you a higher strenght mix in higher slumps.<br>  <br>  If you want to increase this walls strength dramatically drop #5 rebar into cells at a 4'-6' spacing.  Then carefully remove the center webs in the top course of block with a hammer and masons chisel or angle grinder and 4-1/2" masonry disc.  Once the webs are out, set a continuous horizontal run of #5 rebar into the cavity and tie the verticle bars to it. Be sure to over lap the horizontal bars 24" where they meet.  This will give a good strong columned and beamed block wall.<br>  <br>  If you need additional help on this like an accurate calculation on how much concrete, in yards or bags, get back to me and I will be glad to help you out.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|vEsSIGfYaa	It can be done, but I'm not aware of the "easy" way.  Just about everything that has to be done in this project is infinitely easier IF you have a helper, expecially one that is mechanically inclined.<br>  <br>  You will need a funnel  to get the concrete into the holes in the cinder blocks.  Naturally, the small end should fit into the openings in the cinder blocks, and the large end should be larger than the shovel you will use to transfer the concrete.  <br>  <br>  If you cannot find such a funnel you will need to make a cone-shaped funnel out of some thin sheet metal [like galvanized sheet metal; I usually use galvanized "flashing" material] which is slightly smaller at the small end than the openings in the cinder blocks.  The top should be slightly larger than the width of a shovel which you'll use to transfer the concrete.<br>  <br>  Before trying to form the sheet metal into a funnel, I suggest you practice the task using a sheet of paper, many times until you get moves down "pat."<br>  <br>  To form the cone funnel, take a square piece of flat sheet of metal with your hands on opposite sides.  Wear substantial work gloves to avoid cutting your hands to ribbons.  Curl the edges in at an angle to form a cone, smaller at one end and very wide at the other.<br>  <br>  Once you have the proper shape, have an assistant secure the shape at each end with "C-clamps."  When shaped as you want it, and secured, use a drill to drill a line of holes sized for "Pop Rivets" [1/8th inch diameter by 1/8th inch long should do the job].<br>  <br>  Another option would be to make a tapered chute ["trough"] by again using thin sheet metal.  Bend two opposite edges upward 90 degrees and not parallel so that it is narrow [smaller than the holes in the cinder block] at one end to create the sides, and at the other end, wider than the shovel you'll be using to transfer the concrete.<br>  <br>  Once you have a funnel or chute capable of funneling the concrete into the holes, you will need to use a concrete with SMALL AGGRAGATE [the stones or rocks in concrete].  IF the aggrate is too large, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to get the concrete all the way to the bottom of the staggared channels in the cinder block, and there is also a tendency for voids to develop.<br>  <br>  Once ready, with the assistance of a helper, place 5 or 6 shovels full of concrete into a hole, and then use a long rod which will easily fit into the opening.  I use a piece of #3 "Rebar" [round steel reinforcing bar, 3/8th inch diameter] to "rod" the concrete, and rod it a half dozen or so times.<br>  <br>  Rodding is done by plunging the rod down into and up out of the poured concrete to vibrate or "jiggle" it around to make sure there are no voids which weaken the cured concrete.<br>  <br>  Then repeat by adding a little more concrete and rodding it, deeply enough to penetrate the joint between the current pour and the previous one.  Repeat this procedure until a single void is filled.  Do ONE void at a time so as to keep a "wet interface" between the already poured concrete and the concrete you add. This results in what is called a "monolithic" pour which provides the strongest cured mass.<br>  <br>  IF you don't do this, and allow the poured concrete to set, or the surface to dry, and then pour fresh concrete onto the old surface you will get what is called a "cold" joint which will be much weaker than a monolithic pour.<br>  <br>  Once the first columnar void has been filled, then do the second, and so on, being careful to avoid any cold joints. For maximum strength, you could pour the concrete around a #3 rebar installed and left in each channel.|`|fbf036d0bcf69547cc9d92e1f54de8d8aa	You need to make a sand mix slurry. In this case it is recommended that you use Quickcrete, or Sakcrete, purchased at your local lumber supply. Use a wheel barrow or concrete tub, and make the sand mix into a loose slow flowing slurry. Fill each section using a 5 gallon bucket half full of the slurry to pour it in. That works great, with the least amount of over spill and splash.Use a broom stick or piece of 1/2" re bar to poke and settle the slurry. If you fill one section at a time, and remember how much was needed to do that one section, you will have a good idea of how much you will need to complete the job.<br>  <br>  If it has rained recently and the blocks have water down at the bottom, it is best to drill a hole or punch a hole at the bottom to let it out. This is important especially if you live in a section of the country where it gets below zero.|`|botH6rIQaa	due to the staggered pattern of the blocks,  about the only thing you can do to insure a total filling of the space,  is make sure your mixture is very wet,  so it travels easily to the bottom.

WZdEdgxwaa	I wasn't aware there was a cheap steel building,not since the building of that dam in china (my steel costs went up 125%) and haven't come back down much either.Without knowing the intended purpose (workshop/manufacturing) a suggestion.Since steel buildings require an engineered foundation why not use a pole barn? They both come in various sizes and with a considerable savings.<br>  <br>  Here where I live most counties consider a steel building as a perminate structure (taxes) however pole barns are considered movable structures and taxed differently.For the sake of argument you won't need a crane to assist in building.<br>  <br>  My Best|`|944iJNAdaa	I don't think steel buildings are known for their quality, and they'll all be engineered to your local requirements.  I suppose you could look at the thickness of the siding or the roofing, and possibly examine the finish, but what else can a steel manufacturer do different?  From what I've seen I think you can buy steel buildings based on price, it's the finishing details you add that set them apart.

pP5BWrCDaa	It is called "water hammer." When you have a water supply pipe with significant length (usually over 20 feet) that supplies water to more than one fixture this situation can occur. When you flush your toilet, water begins rushing through the pipe & up into the toilet tank via your toilet supply line. Whenever the tank is full it shuts of the fill valve inside the tank. In essence the water builds up momentum as it is filling the tank. When the fill valve in the tank shuts off the momentum is stopped cold. Usually what happens is the momentum of the water will hit the "brick wall" of the now closed fill valve and then reflect back to the other end of the pipe (in your case probably located in the kitchen). Because there is nothing to absorb the unused momentum it causes a "shock" to the pipe which in turn makes it bang, rattle, or whine.<br>  The solution to this is to purchase a water hammer arrestor from your local Lowe's or Home Depot. These little devices usually either have an air chamber or internal mechanized piston to absorb the unused momentum of the water. Usually air chambers are installed on new homes being constructed inside the wall. The easiest fix for you would be to purchase one of these devices that can be installed on the small shutoff valve behind your toilet. If you don't have a shut off valve or you can't find one of these type devices you will most likely want to enlist the help of a professional plumber for installation. You may also need to place water hammer arrestors on the valves beneath your kitchen sink as well as behind the toilet. This should solve your problem.|`|FSbyWJjCaa	same pipe system there all connected once i stoped up the toilet and the kitchen sink was stopped up too when the toilet cleared up so did the sink|`|qsXR5GRBaa	Your water pressure is too high.

Based upon needing 15 rolls, you have a fairly large bedroom or he is using single rolls, not double. Is he charging you for double rolls or single rolls? In an average single roll, you get about 27 sq. ft, In an average double roll about 55 sq. ft. Most wallpaper even considering waste involved due to pattern line up are still 85-90% usable. This accounts for 10-15% waste. When considering wall paper, the smaller the pattern on the paper, the least amount of waste. The larger the pattern, the more you waste. Trim rolls are an average of 15 linear feet. Walls longer than 15 linear feet would require a longer roll.(adds to cost) Good wallpaper sells for an average of $25.00-$50.00 per single roll depending on material and style.

WtqsWctjaa	Make sure your tile and grout are clean and dry before applying the new stain. Use a regular household cleaner and scrub brush to clean the grout lines, and let dry thoroughly before staining.

Lettuce is a cool weather plant, sunlight and high temps. can cause it to bolt.Use you tomatoes or corn to shade lettuce from hot sun (over 70 degrees).Top dress with the 10-10-10, the NPK ( nitrogen-phosphorus-potash) in your soil (if that's what your referring to) should be used up to some extent by growing plants that are yet to be planted there. Plants will use the nitrogen through mineralization or immobilization, phosphorus is essential for plant growth, potash is vital to plant growth related to plant metabolism.Low phosphorus (P hunger)can result in stunted plant.Large amounts of nitrogen are use by plants when they are growing and developing their reproductive parts.So the only low plant nutrient was phosphorus I think fertilizer (10-10-10) should get it to where it needs to be.

Its called know the part before you get the part. <br>  <br>  1. Know your script. Read, re-read and then read again, and not just your own lines. From this foundation you can go on to identify the reason for your lines, this will help you react with the right lines and make remembering easier. <br>  <br>  2. Listen actively, you should give the impression that what your character is hearing is purely of that moment. Resist the temptation to be quick with your lines, just to prove you know them, it is a conversation after all. <br>  <br>  3.Be brave, the quickest way to improve your acting is to realize that your first choice will usually be the easiest for you to do - not the best one for the part. Look beyond your initial choice. <br>  <br>  4. Learn to breath, practice 20 minutes a day. Inhale as deeply as possible and exhale for twice the amount of time you spent inhaling (i.e. inhale 15 seconds exhale 30 seconds). This will help pre-audition stress and stage fright. <br>  <br>  5. Be professional, turning up on time, or early, will give you all the warm up time and, more importantly, the space you need. <br>  This one might not be so obvious, avoid bad mouthing your fellow actors. This is not only good advice because eventually they will find out what you've been saying, but also the actors who are quick to insult other actors are the ones who blame others for their own shortcomings. If you always blame others, you will miss out on the opportunity to accurately evaluate your own performances. <br>  <br>  6. If everyone around you is loosing their heads - keep yours. If you find yourself in a situation where every piece of furniture is being chewed by your fellow cast members, hold your nerve and avoid the melodrama. Your performance will stand out like the calm at the eye of the storm. <br>  <br>  7. Act! The more you act the better you should get. Practice makes perfect after all. The more acting you do, the greater the number of actors and directors you will work with. This will help improve your acting by enabling you to find the truest way for you to develop. <br>  Improve your acting by making your colleagues look as good as possible. It might sound odd but getting the best from colleagues will reflect on your own performance and help you develop. It will also improve your professional reputation which, in turn, should mean you get more work. <br>  <br>  8. Finally, be thick skinned. You have to have the courage to stick to your guns when you think your right, even if you consider the criticism harsh, or are getting lots of rejections. Be honest with your self and be brave, most actors get rejected for most jobs most of the time!|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	Practice in front of the mirror.

You should be in with a reasonable chance in London as a big city is always a degree or two warmer than where we live out in the country. However, as with all gardening choices, you have to balance your love of tropicals with the costs in effort, possible losses to the weather, and the look of your garden in Winter when they're all wrapped up in polythene. Myself, I go for whatever grows well on our soil and will look good all year round - the appearance of the garden in winter is just as important as in summer, just different. I don't think growing plants that are fairly sure-fire in Hampshire UK makes me any less experimental, it just seems a bit kinder to the plants maybe! Still, as you say, it was a 1 in 20 year episode, so they would have us believe, so you should be OK for a while.
p7ZdohGTaa	Do you really want to till the whole yard? That will make a lot of mess. Have you considered simply spreading seed and a little soil? Additionally, you can get nearly any lawn to rejuvinate by simply fertilizing. Perhaps one light fertilizing, then a couple heavy applications. Ultimately, this will crowd the weeds out and thicken the lawn as long as you water.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	You never till land to plant grass.  You will create a huge problem.

Here is our method:<br>  <br>  Plastic pots 14 inches across the top.<br>  <br>  Holds 25 pounds potting soil-we use Miracle-Gro Potting Soil with Plant Food for flowers (not vegetables-ask the clerk at the nursery for vegetable potting soil).<br>  <br>  Mix water crystals into the top six inches of potting soil-these hold water so you do not have to water more than once per week when the temperatures hit 100 degrees.<br>  Water well and leave it alone for a few days so the crystals can absorb the water. Do not plant or the swelling crystals will push your flowers up and out of the potting soil.<br>  <br>  After a few days, mix 4 tablespoons Osmocote flower fertilizer into the top four inches of potting soil. Water in well and wait a day or so.  There is also a vegetable Osmocote fertilizer.   (Read and follow the directions on the container just in case your container is different from ours.)<br>  <br>  Now you can plant. Read the directions on the packages.  Water well.<br>  <br>  Every 14 days fertilize with liquid fertilizer - we use Miracle-Gro Bloom Booster.  Read the directions on the container.<br>  Check for a vegetable liquid fertilizer for veggies. <br>  <br>  Stop fertilizing one month before your first autumn frost. But keep watering.<br>  <br>  You can try to keep your flower plants alive if you have the room. Take them indoors and place in a south facing window (sunny window).<br>  Lightly water through the winter months, but do not fertilize.<br>  Do not put back outside until all frost has past. We usually wait till the nights have reached 68 or 70 degrees.<br>  <br>  Add the Osmocote fertilizer again each spring (or other good flowering fertilizer).<br>  <br>  When flowers start failing, change the potting soil's top 1/3 or 1/2, mix in well, add new water crystals, add fertilizer. Buy new plants. This is usually done every third spring.<br>  <br>  Hint:  Always water till it runs out the bottom.  Wait a few minutes and then water again.  This only need to be done about once per week to ten days when using the water crystals.<br>  <br>  Happy gardening to you.|`|JrQcRtLaaa	seeding is the hardest part. Do you have any good light in your house? That's where you want  to keep your starts. Buy some soil, some plastic containers and a spray bottle. If you really want  to make sure they do well i would also invest in heat pad the heat really makes the the starts take off quickly. It is really important you keep the soil moist at all times this is really important for germination or else your seeds will dry out. So keep them moist everyday with plenty of sunlight when it is time transplant them into there pots. Make sure you read up on the seeds that you are planting because different plants need different care as far as sunlight and water. Most seed packages will have directions on the back that will tell you how specifics as far as how far down you poke the seed in the soil and when to plant the seeds. Some seeds you wont have to start inside you can sow them directly outside. Good luck!<br>  DONT USE EVIL MIRACLE GROW OR ANY OTHER DISGUSTING PESTICIDES.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	You can grow flowers, vegetables and some fruit in pots. Almost anything you can grow in the ground can be grown in pots, it just takes a little more time and more frequent watering.<br>  For fruits in pots you need to look for dwarf varieties. Bananas, plums, figs, pineapples, pomegranate and several others can be grown in pots quite successfully. I have bananas, fig and pineapples growing in pots. <br>  There are even some citrus trees that can be grown in pots, it just takes a very large pot for their root system. <br>  Even blueberries and grapes can be grown in pots.<br>  You will need to use a well-balanced time-release fertilizer and remember to water often. Since the pots are above ground they tend to dry out quickly.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|zKn9IXygaa	Garden seed starting<br>  <br>  If you are new to gardening (and even if you're an old hand), getting your flower garden off to a good start is one of the most important aspects of creating a successful garden. Unless you plan to purchase seedlings, seeds that have already begun the germination process, you'll be starting at the very beginning.<br>  <br>  The indoor method<br>  <br>  Seeds that are planted directly in soil outdoors often have a slim chance of survival. Many gardeners prefer to sow their flower seeds indoors, where they can be watched over and nurtured. There are a number of other reasons why starting seeds indoors is a wise choice:<br>  <br>      * Growing season. In many areas, the growing season is shorter than the time needed for a plant to produce flowers. If sown indoors, gardeners are able to get a jump start and plant flowers that are not native to the area. If you live in an area where late winter seems to never end, starting seeds indoors will ensure they aren't killed off in an early spring frost.<br>  <br>      * Bloom time. When given a head start, many types of flowers begin to bloom earlier than if they were planted outdoors. Marigolds, for example, are a true testament to this.<br>  <br>      * Healthier seedlings. Creating a controlled and nurturing environment for seeds helps them to become healthy and stronger plants. You can guard against leggy seedlings if you're keeping a close watch indoors.<br>  <br>      * Controlling Damping Off disease. White mold is apt to form on the top of soil in cold, damp, dark weather, which will wilt seedlings and eventually kill them. Kept indoors, this disease can be eliminated by keeping seedlings in direct sunlight, allowing soil to dry, increasing air circulation, and removing existing mold.<br>  <br>  Sowing your (indoor) seeds<br>  <br>  There are many indoor resources to help your little ones get going.<br>  <br>      * Seed-starting kits. These magnificent creations have made the world of gardening that much easier. Seed-starting kits usually consist of some sort of bio dome or miniature greenhouse, which includes a bottom tray and vented, clear plastic top, and seedling food. Trays are divided into individual cells, where seeds are planted. Some even include individual sponges or disks, which expand in water, with holes intended for one seed.<br>  <br>      * Grow lights. Although many flower seeds germinate in the dark, once seedlings emerge, they'll need plenty of light. Grow lights can ensure your seedlings continued health, particularly if you don't have a south facing window to place them in. They are also essential on dark, cloudy days, and can be used at night.<br>  <br>      * Plant food. There are usually enough nutrients in soil to keep seeds happy, but a few days after they become seedlings, consider adding a bit of fertilizer. While you don't want to overfeed the plant, giving it a little boost can ensure healthy growth.<br>  <br>  Making the move<br>  <br>  Once your seedlings' roots have started to come out of the bottom of the pot or container, it's time to plant them outdoors. They are also ready to be transplanted if allowed 6 to 8 weeks indoors, the typical time frame recommended for indoor sowing. Of course, weather conditions must be right as well. Most flower seedlings shouldn't be taken outdoors until after the last frost. Any earlier, and you run the risk of cold weather killing off your hard work!<br>  <br>  Here are some tips for making the big move:<br>  <br>      * Let flower seedlings acclimate gently to the outdoors. Put them outside on cloudy days or in the shade. After a few days, give them more light and exposure.<br>  <br>      * Plant new growth while skies are overcast or in the late afternoon. Water immediately after transplanting.<br>  <br>      * Provide protection for flower seedlings, such as an empty milk carton, especially in windy areas or if seedlings wilt.

jWtquDVUaa	He probably hasn't sprayed, it is just his normal aroma, but I hear that they can, but never stuck around for a second shot to find out. And yes you can go out, just make a lot of noise and it will leave. They spray when you surprise them.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	Skunks usually get about 2 or 3 sprays depending on how much they spray the first two times. It usually take a couple of days for a health skunk to re-fill. They can go out but have no defense against other animals. I would say it's safe to go to your car.|`|17b395ded1c4d45bea637b3c447c8b6aaa	Sure if you like his perfume because you'll be wearing some too.  I don't know how long it takes to recharge but I know it not long.  Just wait a second he is as much afraid of you as you are of him.
EmV1Kojyaa	The first thing that came to mind was a "tropical" theme. You can use all these colours to decorate. Walls could be neutral, but painted with palm trees in the foreground and the ocean/sand in the background. On your hanging bed (how cool is that!) you could have a bedspread in black/purple and pillows in all your colours. In one of the corners of the room, you could put a small water fountain that flows real water down into a pool (I have one in my place, it's very soothing and friends comment on how "unique" it is). You could have several real giant palm trees strategically placed around your room (make sure they get plenty of light and water). I would try to find a black dresser and try to find some trim in purple to place around the edge of the mirror or if you can find touch lights in soft purple or lavender, you can attach them to the top corners (they look really cool). I don't know what kind of flooring you have, but if you happen to have linoleum, tiles or hardwood flooring, you could go all out and sprinkle real sand on it near the fountain and in the corners. And for a different touch, they have air fragrances/fresheners or candles that smell like suntan lotion, tropical forest scents and tropical fruit scents. It would give your room a more "virtual reality" feel. <br>  <br>  This is just an idea. I don't know what kind of things you like, so it's hard to do this on the computer. Good luck with your room. Make sure it is something you really love - you'll spend a lot of time there until you are about 18. Believe me.|`|EhPRMuziaa	One of my friends has a really cool room<br>  <br>  3 of the walls are tan<br>  and the other one is a dark teal color<br>  <br>  she has silky brown bedding with cheetah print sheets<br>  and a cheetah print sofa|`|g4LQkRODaa	They have these really cute bedding sets at Target: <a href="http://www.target.com/Cosmopolitan-7-pc-Comforter-Set-Gray/dp/B001G9B74W/qid=1236394037/ref=br_1_1/187-7559823-7563654?ie=UTF8&node=1089830&frombrowse=1&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Cosmopolitan-7-pc-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Zebra-Bedding-Collection/dp/B000P6F5EA/qid=1236394037/ref=br_1_16/187-7559823-7563654?ie=UTF8&node=1089830&frombrowse=1&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Zebra-Bedding-Coll...</a><br>   <br>  I have this one, but it has pink: <a href="http://www.target.com/Xhilaration-Bedding-Collection-Black-Scroll/dp/B000UBWHJQ/qid=1236394037/ref=br_1_4/187-7559823-7563654?ie=UTF8&node=1089830&frombrowse=1&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Xhilaration-Beddin...</a> <br>  You could do the 2nd one with no pink if you wanted to do a vintage themed room.<br>  <br>  You could also try going around to antique shops and finding some fun things to furnish your room with.

iHFZLsDTaa	Start with your City Hall's trash service department.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm sure you will need a permit for the work you are going to do.  Check with City Hall's Inspection department.<br>  <br>  Be VERY careful of digging.  You must always check with the electric company, gas company, and telephone company before you dig (this is a law).  They will come out and mark where they have their wires and plumbing.|`|lBw50ySpaa	Wish I could have it.  Around here people put up a sign for free soil if they pick up.

If you have a large volume of dirt that must be removed, I would make a pile until I found someone who wanted it, then arrange a time for him to pick it up, and be ready to load his truck when he gets there. But ideally, I always aim to consolidate all excess material so I'm not forced to remove it.|`|WZdEdgxwaa	Yes roll off's are available,even from Home Depot.There are companies such as waste management,bfi and smaller companies.Get specific quotes as to there charge and dump fee's.You could just get lucky and sub the job out to a local skid steer service.They have resources for just this type work.On a more somber note,remember to call for utility locates before you dig,last thing you want to do is hit underground utilities.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|So4g8y4Waa	check your yellow pages under waste disposal. make sure you tell them what you are loading in the dumpster.

szyrw5P0aa	hidden rooms|`|lTNxH1eeaa	There's so much to elaborate on here but, I guess ONE thing my dream house would have to have (to be able to categorize it as my DREAM house) would be a nice inner sanctum, with a pond, stones, exotic birds perhaps....<br>  <br>  Just a nice, beautiful place that doesn't even seem like it ought to be part of the house itself.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	My dream house would be just over 2000 sq ft<br>  Looking from the street the first thing a person would notice is a tall arched window, and a long porch across 2/3 of the front.<br>  The roof is steeply slanted, standing tall above, in a dark gray-blue.<br>  The front door glows, with light from inside the house, shining through stained glass.   Entering into a living room with raised, arched ceiling,<br>  one turns toward the view from the tall arched window, then turning to<br>  look around the room, a fireplace rimmed with stone comes into view.<br>  Turning further to the right is a broad arch through which we move into the broad dining room, walled across the front of the house with windows.  Around the front corner French-doors open onto a Patio.<br>  At the back side of the dining room are 2 doors.   The door on the left leads down a broad hallway toward bedrooms and baths.  The door on the right is the kind that swings when pushed on, entering a glorious kitchen, square and bright as the sunshine spills through windows above the sink.  The kitchen is the cook's domain, enclosed with storage and pantry and counters to delight. Nothing harsh or cold here, all is warmth and light.   Standing beside the swinging dining room door is an archway, leading toward the front of the house, where a private breakfast room stands, with corner cupboards to display ornamental nic-nacks cupboards are windows looking out onto the patio-porch.<br>  Returning to the kitchen, crossing toward the back of the house, we move into half-hall, half room of its own, connecting back door, bedroom and baths, laundry room, all entering off of it.  Across the center wall are built-in wooden computer desks, and bookshelves from ceiling to floor.    In a corner stand 2 stuffed chairs resting over a dark patterned area rug.  Beside the back door sits a window seat with coat racks.  Bedrooms on the back hall are separated for privacy and sound.<br>  There is a 5 piece bath...as the main family bathroom, two other baths are 3/4.<br>  Each bedroom has its own  walk-in closet.  Along the long hall toward<br>  the dining room  are linen closets, broad and deep, and a special cupboard filled with games and toys.<br>  One of the bedrooms has its own alcove with a window seat, another bedroom, its own door to a private porch on the back side of the house where gardens grow rich with fruit and flowers.<br>  <br>  My dream house - is my Grandmother's house - filled with laughter - flowing with smells of baking cookies and breads.  A place where we were always welcomed in.<br>  Yes, I dream of a day long ago, but too, I dream of what is to come.<br>  One day I hope to build a house much like hers - for my home - to share warm home baked cookies with my grandchildren.|`|AA10665398	-a huge library with plenty of room for books<br>  -a large bedroom with a balcony<br>  -a huge TV (with plenty of movies on DVD and every channel to watch on it!)<br>  -all of the electronic gaming systems known to man with all of their games<br>  -a really cool/fast computer so i can write my books and have fun online!<br>  -a room for all of my creative energies, like my art supplies or sewing materials. so i can get all of it out and into something<br>  -a garage with a fast car in it<br>  -hidden rooms and passages ways to go places so i don't get bored.<br>  -a high-tech kitchen so i can cook all the food that i like...<br>  and i think that's it! =)|`|aMHIA7XMaa	1.

An indoor swimming pool, large dining room for entertaining, a ballroom for dancing and stables with horses.  The house would have 3 levels with many guest rooms each with a fireplace. The house would have a huge country kitchen with marble counter tops and all decoration would be French Country.  I would have a nursery and play room for children. A chapel for meditation and serious time for praying.  This house would be made of stone with ivy on the outside and many windows to let the sunshine in.  There would be a wine cellar in the basement.  The colors in the home would be pastel:  blue/lavender/peach and lemon colors.  Music would be constant.|`|7bedbdc3fdc2046e48fd21e7702b8a79aa	His and hers workshops, lots of storage, both an everyday kitchen and a feast kitchen (attached to the separate feast hall), stables, a carriage house, a covered riding ring, sunken gardens, wine cellar... actually, I think we'd need 3 or 4 workshops- woodworking, leatherworking, sewing, etc.... lots of acreage, both wooded and cleared.<br>  <br>  A live-in maid/cook would be lovely as well.  With just the 2 of us, we wouldn't need a huge staff of servants, certainly not a nursemaid- but someone to manage the house and kitchens would be grand.|`|d1tyTq6Saa	ok... My dream house would be a big house. It will be in front of  the ocean in Key Biscayne, Miami. Palm trees would cover the front of the house and a big gate will make my house be protected. There would be a BIG pool where the water will fall in the ocean after one movement. On the side of the pool there will be sand for my own little private beach. =)  Then, on the water, there will be a big yacht with two jet-skies.<br>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...<br>  that would be my PERFECT dream house!!!!|`|XeN4Jabxaa	An electric fence, razor wire, a sign that says "NO TRESPASSING", and under it, it says, "Violators will be shot, burned, electrocuted, stabbed with a pitchfork, and then asked politely to leave", a phone service that blocks telemarketers (preferably electrocuting them if they try to call), free electricity, great internet service, buried land mines around it, and a pack of highly trained guard dogs that will tear an intruder's balls and dick off would be great qualities.|`|mbgBFjKOaa	Whores.|`|F6SilA1Faa	proper grammar

IUT6zVFraa	Use Vanish Oxi Action (from Reckitt Benckiser), the pink one.<br>  <br>  I had the exactly same problem yesterday, same bluish little spots. it's my new shirt never worn, but I doubt the stains was caused by color bleeding since all other clothes I washed in the same batch didn't have such problem, I'm still trying to figure this out.<br>  <br>  'Vanish' worked perfectly, after the treatment all the upsetting spots just disappear or unrecognizable by naked eyes.<br>  Use the stain removal way longer than it is recommended, in my case I put the shirt in warm water with Vanish for like 6 hours.<br>  Just remember to check your jacket every once a while, you don't want to do more damage to it.<br>  <br>  Hope you get your perfect jacket back, and find out the real reason caused this "accident", don't let it happen again.<br>  <br>  My shirt is 98% cotton, 2% polyester.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Please no bleach unless you want to ruin it for sure-<br>  <br>  I would try color safe bleach first or oxyclean.  If that doesn't work (and it probably won't), go to the dye section in any supermarket and buy Rit Color Remover, about $3.  It should take out the bleeding color.<br>  <br>  It is the only thing I know that is for sure, but you don't mention what kind of material your jacket is.<br>  As it is, it is unusable, so you might try something else first and then Rit.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I have used it several times in the past but usually on cotons.
L2fGkm05aa	I know how you feel, this has happened to me many times. But,try this.. go buy you a box of BIZ in the laundry department at Wal Mart and run some  COLD WATER  in the washer, put a LOT more BIZ than the instructions say so you will have a STRONG solution , let it  wash gently for a few minutes and then, (here's the punchline) SOAK IT for a COUPLE of days and then let the cycle finish out on delicate.  You should have an almost new jacket again. IT WORKS..|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Not real sure about that, but can't hurt to try this: Sprinkle stains with salt; let sit for several hours. When dry, brush away salt and wash, or clean immediately with club soda or seltzer.<br>  Or maybe you could just buy some dye and redo the color.<br>  Sorry to hear about the nice V.S. jacket. I would cry ;(.
944iJNAdaa	No.  Coal ash is not beneficial to a garden because its potassium and phosphorus content is very low compared to wood. Plus, coal ash also contains a great deal of other elements, such as cobalt, boron, and arsenic among others, which are toxic to plants, animals, and people.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hearth.com/econtent/index.php/articles/proper_ash_removal" rel="nofollow">http://hearth.com/econtent/index.php/art...</a>|`|88SGoW1Iaa	Just burn some wood and use that instead|`|9342464108cdccadf862042b1595cc67aa	Wood ash is great but not coal ash, it is know to contain arsenic and selenium (not good for man nor beast)

Gzk1TQFAaa	Your cheapest option would be to get a piece of plywood and cut to size.  place the plywood under the cushions and there will be no more sagging!<br>  <br>  (plywood would probably cost $20-$25)|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Most probably easier/cheaper to buy a new couch. BUT call around and ask.|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	Unless the *COVERINGS* of the couch mean *Just a Whole Lot* to you and they are in "Only Slightly Worn & Soiled" condition, I would advise that you look around for a *NEW* couch that won't "cripple you" financially, and *Buy It"! <br>  <br>  I suspect that you might not even have springs in your old couch cushions.|`|rLy6yD70aa	An upholstery shop would be where to hire the job out, but it would be costly.  If you have basic tools and do it yourself skills, you might just flip the couch upside down and see what the actual problem is. If  the underside is enclosed, you can usually pry the staples out with a screwdriver.  Once opened up, it could simply be that the spring brackets pulled out of their screw holes.  You could fix that yourself by gluing toothpicks into the holes and screwing the brackets back in. Then you could put back the liner with thumbtacks.|`|fBORjbh5aa	Probably cheaper just to buy a used one on Craiglist or similar
l9xnybUMaa	Im with you on this one...you are buying used furniture, with no warranty, inelgible for any of the fabric protection plans and AS IS for any unknown defects or problems, for this risk you should assume at least a 30-50 percent discount, especially if its discontinued which means you cannot order chairs, ottomans or other pieces to match it later...how bad do you need it?

y8b86tTEaa	You can choose the storage based on different criteria. If the knife care is primary goal, then nothing beats the wood block. I mean slotted block, not Kapoosh. Even if the knife edge slides on the wood it's not going to damage or dull it considerably. <br>  I've had mine custom made, because of the space considerations and sheer number of knives I had to fit in - <a href="http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/kkmap.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/...</a><br>  <br>  Another very good choice is JK Adams In-Drawer Knife Tray Wave, like this - <a href="http://www.cooking.com/products/shprodde.asp?SKU=160866." rel="nofollow">http://www.cooking.com/products/shprodde...</a> Relatively compact and safe for edges. I've used one for a while, then retired once I got the big block.<br>  <br>  Kapoosh knife block(linked in another post) is the box filled with fibers. It's convenient and stores quite a bit, but the synthetic fibers damage delicate edges, especially with prolonged use. Most of the knife guys avoid it. If the knives you're planning to store aren't that important, then it might be a good choice too, but I'd never put any knife I care about in it.<br>  <br>  Magnetic racks have their pros and cons. Major con being exposed blade. So, as others mentioned if you have kids or curious pets in house, that's pretty much out.<br>  <br>  Another problem with magnetic knife strips is that 99% of the people simply slap the blade on the strip and later just grab the handle and pull it. Both actions do damage the edge. <br>  A correct way is to hold the handle firmly and land the blade spine first at some angle, 30-45 will do, then slowly rotate, until the blade is flat on the strip.<br>  Removing the knife from the strip is the opposite, first rotate the handle slightly to release(lift) the edge and then pull. In the beginning it requires some effort, but in time becomes automatic.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	The magnetic strips are great if you have the wall room to put them up and don't have small children in the house.  A wooden knife block is second best but they take up counter space.  Third best is storing the knife in a sleeve type covering.  My husband made me a couple for my chef's knives because they don't fit in my knife block.  It's pretty much a cardboard sleeve with an opening on the end that the knife slides into.  It protects the knife and your fingers if you must store them in a drawer.|`|7c007d90b52d84105c8a22e166229b79aa	Good old fashioned enclosed knife rack. The one with the slots on top,|`|KjQaxGX0aa	Hello the answer about the magnetic strip right is on the money.  That may be okay for a home situation but in a commercial kitchen I don't know if it would work, too many chefs, kitchen hands etc.  Then there are knife blocks which are not only appropriate but can look very stylish to. Some can hold 20 knives plus the knife steel(sharpener) and scissors.  They can be made of glass, steel, wood and can placed on the counter or underneath.  Another solution is some knives have their own sheaths or covers.  If you store them in drawer use a cutlery tray so keep them separate if they are expensive if cheap don't worry.  Lastly a lot of chefs carry their own knives in special carry rolls like jewellery rolls or cases to keep them in tip top condition.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps I can't think of anymore tips good luck|`|pF6R2quWaa	oh....i would store it in a knife block which are really easy to use. they can be placed anywhere you want but i prefer it in a cabinet so that it wont be easy access for children, pets, or "unwanted guests"<br>  here's an example of one<br>     <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kapoosh-Knife-Holder-Woodgrain-Finish/dp/B000Q4I9LM/ref=sr_1_11/179-3106079-6796042?ie=UTF8&s=kitchen&qid=1236404133&sr=1-11" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Kapoosh-Knife-Hold...</a>|`|fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	I recommend a magnetic strip attached to the wall.  We have one in our kitchen...it's a piece of wood with a rather strong set of magnets in it.  It holds our cutlery up-right and keeps it out of the drawers where there could be safety concerns and where the blades could get chipped.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Hmm,. how about that magnetic strip that you hang on the wall.<br>  Hope that helps, good luck|`|0WdCa5gLaa	I sheathe my knives or use a butcher block which has slots to store them.  Either will cover the blade and allow safe storage.   The butcher block is probably best because it uses gravity to keep the blade in place during storage.<br>  <br>  Some knives come with sheaths  (cover that protects the blade), but if they don't it is simple to make one with lightweight cardboard and masking tape.  Just fold the cardboard to fit the blade, then tape around the cardboard to hold the shape.<br>  <br>  This definitely avoids cuts.  <br>  Using a magnetic strip would still leave the blade exposed.
