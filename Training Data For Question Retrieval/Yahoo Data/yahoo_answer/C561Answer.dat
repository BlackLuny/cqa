91208a5b62aa6c864b33e9a67a21f3a1aa	The key element in achieving results when exercising is working out + rest. It is VITAL to get a significant amount of recovery when rested. Athletes who train 10 hours a day are no better than those who train 2 hours twice a day.<br>  <br>  Exercise intensively one day, then intermediate the next, intensive, intermidiate, light.. mix it up so that you do not burnout. Make sure you have one day of rest too, perhaps, Sunday.<br>  <br>  Eat good food and everything is perfect.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Twice a day is enough. 3 times is damaging to your body, if pressed. If not even 3 times will make you burnout and get bored after a while.. reducing positive outcome.|`|FkXt4XLvaa	Depends on how long and at what amount of effort you are working out. 30 to 45 minutes of exercise (even if you split it throughout the day) is what most trainers will tell you is safest (unless you are an athlete). If you want to split it up, you just need to make sure you have at least 10 to 15 minutes of consistent exercise.<br>  <br>  Also, don't do the same exercise as you did during your prior workout. Work on your upper body during one and then your lower body during the second. And don't switch them around. Your body needs time to adjust to the changes in its muscle tone before you start exercising it again. If you do too much to one part of you, you could damage muscles and defeat your efforts.<br>  <br>  If you are a strenuous exerciser, if you basically collapse after working out, you should take a day off in between for the same purpose as mentioned above.<br>  <br>  If this is basic stay in shape type of stuff like a run before a morning shower and one after getting home from work, I think that sounds good and your body probably enjoys and needs it.<br>  <br>  If you feel you are not doing enough, if you're trying to lose weight and it's just not happening, you are probably working out incorrectly and adding another workout won't help. You need to learn what exercises will actually help you.<br>  <br>  Join a gym or rent/buy some exercise videos specifically for losing weight such as Richard Simmons - he's odd but he knows what he is doing when it comes to weight loss - or Biggest Loser.
EcCbforQaa	Much like a teen girl in many ways. So much peer pressure and the need to be accepted (normal).

Its not an easy time for boys or girls.|`|58xXEE6Faa	its the same like being a teenage girl except physically different haha|`|GvEsaVYeaa	Well, the best way to know is to sit down and ask a teenage boy. Ask as many questions as you can (or that they have patience for), instead of something general like this. Just make sure that if you choose a popular boy, make sure you don't wear a skirt or low cut shirt, as the topics will only get to one place, and I'm sure you know what that is.|`|tp9ZBWEtaa	Teenage boys think about sex, sex, sex, and more sex.

sXmdppnHaa	Well, the best person to talk it out with would probably be a psychologist or therapist because they will be able to help you in a way that no one else can. But a lot of it depends on how depressed you are and what you are depressed about. If you are actually, legitimately depressed, then you should get help from somewhere, but if you are just in a bad funk then maybe hanging out with a good friend would be more productive. If you are truly depressed (and there are a few sites that will give you a questionnaire to determine whether you are depressed or not, but be careful; some are less accurate than others), then you should find a psychologist and ask about testing for clinical depression, especially if you are unsure what you are depressed about. Clinical depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain and as long as the imbalance is there, you will feel sad and depressed. The only cure for clinical depression is medication containing the chemicals that your brain needs to balance out and become normal again. <br>  <br>  But ultimately you must determine what you truly need. If you have any more questions or just want to talk, you can contact me on messenger or e-mail me. I'm studying to become a psychologist so I may have a lot of insight into what is going on with you and I would be glad to help you stop hurting. I cannot promise you too much, though, since I am also only in high school and I'm pretty depressed myself. But please, if you are ever really hurting and you cannot take it, either call a friend (someone extremely close to you, a close friend or a boyfriend), or e-mail me instead of hurting yourself physically. I'm in that same boat right now and believe me when I say hurting yourself can become addictive and suicide is much too permanent. Do not ever let yourself do them. A good, healthy human life is too precious.|`|XEvK4urxaa	emailed you!|`|LknYI7FFaa	We all get depressed, and its good to talk to some one. I got 40 years of ups and downs.

GOoLwd0Aaa	B12 taken orally has very little side effects if any at all. B12 taken by injection can cause anxiety/panic attacks but it is widely believed by healthcare professionals that it is the preservatives causing the side effects and not the B12 itself. B12 also known as Cobalamin is found naturally in organ meats like liver, other meats, shell fish, dairy products and some vegetables so unless you have anemia it is usually not necessary to take it as a supplement as long as you are eating a well balanced diet. Always remember that moderation is the key. Too much of a good thing can turn out to be bad in the long run.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	B12 helps a lot.

Perhaps, some of your stitches fell out, or the surgeon didn't place enough stitches in the area.  The flap of skin is probably hanging gum tissue.  Call your surgeon.  Usually, you are scheduled for a return appointment to have the stitches taken out.  If you were not scheduled for a return visit to have the stitches removed then you had a crummy Surgeon, who failed to stitch up your gum's surgical wound.  After the stitches are removed the gums continue to heal, and should become a nice smooth surface.

Or if you recieved a bit of a tissue graft, then that could be it coming loose.<br>  <br>  If it's just a small flap of gum, then You should be just fine leaving it alone.  Actually, no matter the size of the flap, you should just not touch it and let it heal up.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).
fomkCUCiaa	Normally, i just unbutton, zip, and piss. however, if i'm at work and i need to get back to the floor, i just unzip.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I love answering the truly important questions!<br>  <br>  I only unzip, no unbuttoning.|`|YQfmBvHPaa	I undo the belt and button.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	I unzip or just unbutton the fly and the my willie through them.  Unbuttoning the belt is better as there's no restriction to the urine flow by pressing the penis, but this is too much of a pain for me.|`|pOZubuOcaa	I usually unbutton <br>  sometimes i do unzip <br>  it depends i guess haha|`|KBvkGc6baa	unzip|`|OVtUnuYnaa	un zip|`|b8a51f5098090ab33a464a74631f3bd9aa	Well for me it just depends. If I'm wearing low-rise jeans then I'll unbuckle and unbutton. I do it so I have more room to pull it out. The zipper or button fly in low-rise jeans (the rise) is not too long so unzipping only is not enough for me. Now when I'm in dress pants, unzipping will usually be enough because the rise is usually longer and if the pant is pleated then it gives even more space to pull it out thru zipper hole. Also another reason I just unzipp when wearing dress pants is because more than likely I'll be wearing a dress shirt tucked in and I hate messing up a good tuck or having to re-tuck. Another thing that comes into play when deciding if to unzipp only or undo it all is the style of underwear I'm wearing. I only wear boxer briefs but not all of them have an easy access fly, some don't even have one, some have a pouch in front, others don't & are just flat in the front to allow for more support. The ones with a fly I can work with just unzipping, when wearing the others I have to undo my pants and  pull my penis out from the top of my underwear, of course pulling the waist band down a bit helps. I do get lazy and try to just unzipp with no fly boxerbriefs but it's not as easy to reach the waistband and even then, trying to pull down on the band thru the zipper is not easy either. It makes the zipper hole even smaller and also harder to piss becouse the band is squezzing my penis.  lol   So, there you have it... for me it's all about how much space and comfort my pants provide for me to hang out and take a leak.|`|6NN8sAC7aa	when i wear normal jeans, i just unbutton. when i wear skinny jeans with really small zipper, i undo the belt and button.|`|N8DFsZB5aa	I don't wear belts but I undo the button aswell as it just feel better when peeing.|`|IBshj7fDaa	i tent to unbutton. i dont like having to unzip and pull it out.|`|4f861da13e3f26c7f99940320c6fee08aa	i undo the button its not all that great trying to take something out that is so big in a tiny hole|`|u4LLFhORaa	refuse to answer
GvEsaVYeaa	Actually, the act of intercouse releases endorphins, the brains "happy drug". This is why in sitcoms (usually) someone will come in to work happy, and a person usually makes the comment: "You are really happy today. Oh my god, you had sex last night, didn't you?". For some reason, this only happens between male/female couples and only with actual contact.|`|fomkCUCiaa	I've never put a sailor (Seamen) in a girl, but i do know that when a girl has sex, it obviously feels good, so when a guy puts his "Semen" in a girl, it probably has made you happy.|`|FI916ISFaa	No, but releasing sperm (which contain semen) can (and probably will) make you pregnant.|`|JIrud5INaa	You probably had an orgasm.

fPSNxm7saa	Yes. Having a photographic memory is remembering pictures, details, diagrams, etc. <br>  <br>  For example, let's say you have to learn by heart something for an exam. Someone that has a photographic memory will be able (during the exam) to close their eyes and see all the details of what they studied. Other people will remember places after smelling someting familiar, or hearing something familiar . <br>  <br>  Did you ever play those games in books or news papers...The one where you had two identical pictures and had to find differences? Or those memory games where you would spread cards (face down) on a table, and then flip two at a time and try to find the pairs? Those are all great ways to help you build a photographic memory.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer has helped. ;)|`|g0RXhcpmaa	WEll photographic memory is when someone can memorize somethings in their brain as a picture...<br>  <br>  for eg. <br>   <br>  U see a man who is tall and blond- haired, if u had photographic memory u would remember that as a picture in ur mind|`|DsEEATKSaa	Eidetic memory<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B~|`|q9BItD25aa	If you study psychology they will tell you there is no such thing.

ea3ae94089a53982539649b0315537a9aa	La tiroides es una glándula con forma de mariposa, que se encuentra ubicada en el cuello, por delante de la traque, consta de dos lóbulos y tiene un peso aproximado de 15 a 20 gramos en el adulto. Esta glándula se encarga de regular las funciones metabólicas del cuerpo, "el metabolismo se refiere a la manera en que el cuerpo humano quema las calorías, las grasas y los azúcares y produce músculos"; esto lo lleva acabo mediante la liberación de hormonas tiroideas. La mas importante es la tiroxina (t4) y la triyodotironina (t3), la t4 es liberada a la circulación la cual es transformada a t3 . normalmente la glándula tiroidea libera estas hormonas por mando de la glándula pituitaria la cual se encuentra en la base del cráneo.<br>  <br>  La glándula tiroides puede sufrir alteraciones y por ello causar que se libere menos hormona a la sangre, lo que condiciona una enfermedad conocida como hipotiroidismo y cuando libera hormonas en exceso la enfermedad se conoce con el nombre de hipertiroidismo.<br>  <br>  El hipotiroidismo es una condición en la que la glándula tiroides libera menor cantidad de sus hormonas a la circulación, y por ello reduce el metabolismo del cuerpo " lo enlentece". Esto puede ser resultado de una inflamación de la glándula, como en el caso de la enfermedad llamada tiroiditis de Hashimono ( o tiroiditis autoinmune), esta enfermedad es causada por que las defensas del cuerpo atacan a la glándula tiroides cuando no debe hacerlo. Otra causa de la disminución de en la función de la tiroides es debida a un tratamiento previo a una enfermedad conocida como hipertiroidismo.<br>  <br>  Los síntomas del hipotiroidismo dependen de los niveles de hormonas tiroideas en la sangre, los cuales pueden ser: fatiga, debilidad, Aumento de peso, intolerancia al frió, dolores y calambres musculares, estre?imiento, depresión, perdida de la memoria y menstruación regular. <br>  <br>  Los signos que se pueden notar en las personas pueden ser: hinchazón de la cara y manos, lentitud de movimientos, irritabilidad, disminución del apetito sexual, cabello áspero y seco, piel seca y pálida y perdida del cabello. Así mismo puede presentarse inflamación o agrandamiento de la glándula "conocido también bocio"<br>  <br>  El diagnostico es sencillo y se realiza mediante la medición de un estudio llamado perfil tiroideo, dicho estudio realiza la medición de las hormonas tiroideas y demuestra que los valores de las hormonas se encuentran por debajo del nivel normal.<br>  <br>  El tratamiento del hipotiroidismo se realiza de manera medica y consiste en administrar levotiroxina la cual es la hormona tiroidea mas activa. Esta se administra por vía oral y preferentemente por la ma?ana. Es probable que el paciente deba continuar con el tratamiento durante toda su vida.<br>  <br>  El hipertiroidismo es una condición en la que la glándula tiroides libera mayor cantidad de sus hormonas a la circulación, y por ello aumenta el metabolismo del cuerpo " lo acelera ". <br>  <br>  Las enfermedades que ocasionan el hipertiroidismo son: la enfermedad de Graves ( bocio difuso tóxico) consiste es un aumento en el tama?o de la glándula tiroides de manera difusa; otro causa pueden ser los nódulos tóxico, la glándula a veces puede contener nódulos, de los cuales algunos se pueden tornar hiperactivos y producir un exceso de hormona tiroidea, si el nódulo es único se llama adenoma tóxico y si son mas de uno los hiperfuncionantes se conoce como bocio multinodular tóxico; una sobre dosis de la hormona tiroidea puede ocasionar hipertiroidismo de manera transitoria.<br>  <br>  Así mismo consumir en exceso el yodo puede condicionar que la glándula tiroides produzca mas hormona; la tiroiditis que consiste en una inflamación de la glándula, puede ocurrir tras un embarazo o una enfermedad de origen viral, en estos casos el hipertiroidismo es pasajero y posteriormente el paciente puede sufrir de hipotiroidismo.<br>  <br>  Los síntomas del hipertiroidismo dependen de los niveles de hormonas tiroideas en la sangre, los cuales pueden ser: fatiga, debilidad, perdida de peso, intolerancia al calor, diarrea, insomnio, nerviosismo, palpitaciones. <br>  <br>  Los signos que se pueden notar en las personas pueden ser: temblor, ansiedad, cabello sedoso y delgado, piel caliente y húmeda, y ojos saltones y un aumento de tama?o de la glándula tiroides.<br>  <br>  El diagnostico de hipertiroidismo se realiza de manera sencilla con pruebas de laboratorio donde se miden los niveles de hormonas tiroideas en sangre, en es caso de hipertiroidismo estos valores son mas altos de lo normal.<br>  <br>  El tratamiento del hipertiroidismo puede ser manejado de diversas maneras, ya sea medico, con radiaciones o quirúrgico. <br>  <br>  Tratamiento medico: se administran medicamentos que eviten la producción de hormonas por la glándula, de los cuales existen el metimazol y el propiltiuracilo, al igual que medicamentos que regulen la frecuencia cardiaca.<br>  <br>  Tratamiento con radiación: se administra una dosis de yodo 131 ( I131) radioactivo en una sola dosis en cápsula, el cual ocasiona la destrucción del tejido de la glándula tiroides y posterior reemplazo hormonal ya que la glándula disminuye o suprime la secreción de hormona.<br>  <br>  La cirugía consiste en remover una parte o al totalidad de la glándula, esto para obtener un nivel normal de hormonas en sangre. Las complicaciones mas frecuentes de la cirugía son el hipotiroidismo, perdida de la voz.|`|AA10269747	La tiroide no es una enfermedad, es una glándula situada en la parte frontal del cuello.  Más o menos donde en un hombre se ubica la "manzana de Adán".<br>  Esa glándula que es parte del sistema endocrino (hormonal) y regula metabolismo, temperatura y muchas cosas más incluyendo los estados de ánimo.  La glándula tiroidea o Tiroide en ocasiones se descompensa y trabaja de más que se lama Hipertiroidismo o a veces trabaja de menos y se llama Hipotiroidismo.<br>  Hay muchas maneras de tratar ambas irregularidades y los médicos que se especializan en ello se les llama Endocrinólogos.  Si tienes algún problema o alguien que conoces, acudan cuanto antes a un BUEN endocrinólogo pues es una glándula muy muy delicada.  Mis mejores deseos!

I wish females would get off this damn thing about needing a big penis to have sex with. Every mans penis size is predetermined at birth. It's called genetics. So why don't you just stick with the love of a guy, not the size of his package. That's the way most of us guys feel about you. I have noticed that, nothing against blacks, most guys who have a 9" or bigger penis doesn't give a sh*t about the girl. If she gets pregnant, he leaves. And these dumbass white say they're in love with blacks, and I know a bunch of girls who get beaten and taken advantage of and claim they're in love.|`|AA11122098	The race does not matter about the size of a male's penis.

It's a natural performance and activity. Masturbation and sexual intercourse are the two most common sexual practices, but they are not mutually exclusive (for example, many people find the sight of their partner masturbating highly erotic).

AA11196432	A hymen is a real thin wall, right inside a woman's vaginal area. It can be broken by having sexual intercourse or by wearing tampons. <br>  <br>  If you do wear tampons, your hymen will be broken before sex, making it less painful.<br>  <br>  The problem with telling how painful it is when it is broken is rather difficult for a couple of reasons. First, everybody has different pain tolerances. Secondly, each hymen is a different thickness. Some women have really thick ones, meaning that it hurts the first ten times she has sexual intercourse (some are so thick, some (very few) women can't even have sex). Some are thinner than normal, meaning that it will only hurt the first 2 or 3 times she has intercourse. <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question!!|`|AA10146029	ya its fine it will make ur partner more happy and maybe shows u dont play sports|`|AA12398235	no i don't have any idea what that is|`|be7de9d4ba67319fec1a612620ef7166aa	When I saw another poster's answer to your question I felt compelled to answer.  It is NOT true that tampons break a woman's hymen; in fact, the hymen is an elastic barrier and will expand to accomodate insertion of tampons.  <br>  <br>  However, by the time they begin having sex, most girls do NOT have a hymen any longer.  This is because the hymen is a fragile membrane and is easily broken by things such as horseback riding, falling off a bicycle as a child, playing sports, falling out of a tree, etc.  <br>  <br>  It does not make sex more painful for the first time if your hymen is not broken.  The first time you have sex is generally uncomfortable at first for both the girl AND the guy (I know it's hard to believe, but it's true) until the vagina has expanded more to accomodate your partner.|`|ce026d0292baf8e0b7d57d875c65af28aa	no it shouldnt but hey i have no clue what your talking about

However, some of these chemicals are also found in other parts of the body as well.  The combination of this paired with the fact that depression alone causes fatigability, plus the possible fatigue from antidepressants, lowers not only desire but ability to engage in sex.|`|51d1035fe7a3109cc0270d107de0c608aa	Some antidepressants do and others do not.<br>  Talk to your doctor and he should be able to tell you which ones do not.<br>  But............the ones that do not may not be what works for you with your depression.<br>  You have to take the medication that works for YOU.<br>  Alot of people are only "situation" depressed, and that sounds like your problem.<br>  Just be patient, get your life on track, take your medication that works for you.<br>  And then when your situation improves your doctor may take you off the medication.<br>  <br>  But until then worry about getting yourself well before you worry about getting into an intimate relationship.

It is a 7 day diet and it is used in hospitals for patients who need to lose weight quickly for heart surgery and its healthy for you! The best thing about this diet is that you can lose 15-17 pounds per week if you follow it EXACTLY. I know it sounds crazy, but I was going on a vacation and did it the week before I went and I lost 12 pounds! (I cheated too). On this diet you can eat as much as you want everyday but can only eat certain foods. It is hard but worth it in the end if you can stick to it! And another good thing about this diet is that I didnt gain back the weight fast and I went back to my old eating habits. So when I need to lose a few pounds I just do this diet for a week and it works for me and everyone I know that has tried it. In fact I know some who have lost 30 + pounds in 2-3 weeks!

Most of the weight you lost is water weight.  Juice diets do nothing but dehydrate you, the fat is still there and the weight will come back when you start eating normally again.  You can lose about 2lbs of fat per week but it will be done with a reduced calorie balanced diet, not juice diets, they just do not work for real results.  Honestly you need to determine your BMR which is the amount of calories that you burn per day without exercise, eating, etc. called existence calories.  The best formula for this is called the Harris Benedict formula, you can search for it online, it will give you BMR and the amount of calories you burn when active, exercising, etc.  When you come up with a number subtract 1000 calories and shoot for that per day.  It takes a caloric deficit of 3500 calories to lose 1 lb of fat, so 1000 deficit per day x 7 days give you 2 lbs per week.  Nobody said it was easy but what you are doing now is unhealthy and the weight you are losing, very little is fat.  It is just how it is.

AA12289306	Generally speaking, whats more important is body fat percentage or body composition, but as another general rule, start at 5'0/100lbs and add 5 pounds per inch of height. So at 5'3, 115 would be ideal. It wouldnt hurt to probably lose 5-10 pounds though.<br>  <br>  Cardio, cardio, cardio. This helps you with the simple philosophy behind fat loss: Burn more calories than you take in. If your goal is fat loss, incorporate 4–6, 30–60-minute sessions per week into your training schedule.<br>  <br>  Of iron and sweat. If your goal is to lean out, follow your weight training with cardio. Since lifting depletes glycogen stores, your body is more likely to use fat as its first fuel source during cardio. Also, the combination of the two results in a higher caloric burn post workout.<br>  <br>  Tread heavily. What’s the best exercise and intensity to burn maximal fat? Researchers found that jogging on the treadmill at about 70% of your maximal heart rate, or MHR (subtract your age from 220 and multiply by 0.7 for your heart rate in beats per minute), was optimal, burning about 40 grams of fat per hour of exercise. Going above or below this intensity burned significantly less fat, as did pedaling on a stationary cycle, regardless of intensity.<br>  <br>  Run hungry. If you can stomach getting up earlier, perform cardio before your first meal of the day. Your body is most likely to use fat as the first energy source because your glycogen stores are depleted. If you’re concerned with muscle loss, take 10–20 grams of whey protein before your session, but stay away from carbs.<br>  <br>  Post-cardio burn. Following aerobic exercise, your resting metabolic rate remains elevated for anywhere from 60 minutes to about 12 hours, depending on the intensity and duration of the exercise session.<br>  <br>  Move outdoors. Try your next outdoor run on sand, which is more difficult than running on harder surfaces like cement. It’s easier on the joints as well, but wear shoes to avoid stress fractures and protect your feet from glass. Running on grass is also a welcome relief to joints and arches.<br>  <br>  Taper off. Instead of starting slow and building up speed, do your high-intensity cardio early in your workout and taper off to a slow finish to burn significantly more fat. After a 2–3-minute warm-up, immediately kick it into high gear (80%–85% max heart rate) for 15–20 minutes before slowing down (60%–65% max heart rate) for the last 10–20 minutes.<br>  <br>  Vary your cardio. Whether you’re lifting weights or doing cardio, the trick is to keep your body from adapting to what you’re doing. Regularly changing your cardio mode is the best way to keep your body responding to your efforts.<br>  <br>  Interval for success. Unless you’re a highly conditioned athlete, you can’t maintain a very intense pace for very long, so the best way to improve your aerobic fitness and burn fat is with intervals. That is, you alternate very intense periods of work with lower-intensity sessions in which you recover.<br>  <br>  No butts. Smoking deprives cells of the oxygen they need to maximize metabolism, keeps muscles from repairing themselves after exercise and makes cardio a lot tougher. Plus, your smoke-scented clothes are sure to irritate fellow gym rats.<br>  <br>  Fidget to fight fat. Are you a fidgeter? Maybe you should be. Several studies have shown that toe-tapers, while completely annoying at the office, will burn more calories over the course of the day than the stationary man.<br>  <br>  NUTRITION<br>  <br>  Stay hydrated. Active individuals actually require more water and should aim to consume roughly 1 gallon per day to avoid becoming dehydrated. And if you’re one of those people who hate drinking water, consider this: Dehydrated individuals burn less fat than their well-watered counterparts.<br>  <br>  Eat more frequently. Eating 5–6 small meals a day as opposed to “three squares a day” causes your metabolism to work constantly. Eating larger meals, on the other hand, slows your metabolism and forces leftover calories to be stored as fat.<br>  <br>  Eat protein. Since muscle-building is the fastest route to slim down, you want to make sure that your protein consumption is enough to keep up with your weight training. Eat too little protein and your gains could be much slower. Get 1–1.5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight per day to help your muscle gains along. Use protein bars and shakes to supplement your whole-food consumption and stave off cravings.<br>  <br>  Get leafy. Those who eat a salad before dinner tend to consume less calories overall during dinner. But don’t sabotage yourself — stay away from high-fat dressings like ranch, blue cheese and Caesar.<br>  <br>  Skip happy hour. Alcohol consumption can temporarily blunt testosterone levels, hindering muscle repair and growth and blunting sexual drive. Also, the calories from alcoholic beverages — in the neighborhood of 100–200 each without cocktail mixers — add up faster than you may think.<br>  <br>  Cut out soda. Instead, rely on water and other flavored drinks like Crystal Light to get your fluids every day. If you drink one soda per day, you’re adding 1,750 calories per week to your diet. Also, studies have shown that those who regularly consume diet sodas tend to gain weight in the long run because of overindulgences elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Calories out! The goal in any fat-loss or weight-loss program should be to burn more calories than you consume. Aim to cut total calorie consumption by about 250 calories per day. Yes, that means you’ll have to figure out how many calories you eat in a normal day. Get on it. The math will pay big dividends later.<br>  <br>  Got the munchies? If you can do without the butter and salt, plain popcorn is a winner. Two quarts has the same number of calories as just 20 potato chips. By substituting 1 cup of plain, unbuttered popcorn for a 1-ounce bag of chips, you’ll save 135 calories and 10 grams of fat.<br>  <br>  The magical fruit. Subjects who ate half of a grapefruit with meals or drank 8 ounces of grapefruit juice three times a day lost 4 pounds (with some losing more than 10 pounds) in 12 weeks without dieting.<br>  <br>  Carb smart. Keep your carbohydrates low to moderate when trying to lose weight. If you rotate low- and high-carb days, you’ll be able to keep your energy levels up while running a caloric deficit. Good, clean, fiber-rich carbs include oats, potatoes, rice and whole-grain bread. Also, limit high-carb drinks like fruit juice to post workout, when your body needs carbs to speed recovery.<br>  <br>  Operation Dinner Out. Be diligent when ordering in a restaurant. Have your meats grilled without oil or grease. Ask for steamed vegetables with no butter. Get a salad (no cheese) with either low-fat dressing or vinaigrette.<br>  <br>  Avoid simple sugars. Too much sugar in your diet can wreak havoc on your metabolism by spiking your insulin response and promoting the accumulation of body fat over time. Immediately after exercise, however, is an ideal time to ingest simple sugars; otherwise, steer clear.<br>  <br>  GI Low. For most of the day, your carb options should be of the low-glycolic variety, meaning they’re digested and burned more slowly. Athletes who eat low-GI carbs burn more fat throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Eat more fiber. Fiber, both soluble and insoluble, is essential to health and helps decrease body fat. Adults should consume 35–40 grams of fiber per day, with about a third of that coming from insoluble fibrous sources. Along with whole grains rich in beneficial fiber, consume high amounts of fibrous vegetables, such as broccoli, to attain your daily intake. High-fiber foods also promote satiety.<br>  <br>  Timed consumption. When you eat is just as important as what you eat. Many people who eat way too much at night should re-evaluate their eating patterns. Eat two-thirds of your day’s calories before dinnertime to avoid overeating late in the day.<br>  <br>  Prepare. Watch what you eat around work. If your workplace serves nothing healthy, tote food or snacks along with you. If you’re attending a workplace function in which only junk food is served, pre-eat. Having recently eaten something that’s healthy and adequate in calories to meet your energy needs, it’s easier to say no to the junk and empty calories.<br>  <br>  Get yolked. Eating eggs for breakfast was recently found to reduce hunger and food intake for up to 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Slow down, Turbo! Successful dieters and fitness buffs will tell you that fast eating and body fat go hand in hand because you end up overeating. It takes about 10 minutes for the food in your stomach to signal your brain that you’ve eaten enough.<br>  <br>  Don’t be salty. Excess sodium consumption can make you look softer and cause you to burn less fat. Most people get way too much, anyway, especially if you eat a lot of processed foods. To help you look leaner and strip sodium from your diet, drink more water, cut back on highly processed foods and switch to potassium chloride to season your foods.<br>  <br>  Got milk? Research has shown that individuals who consume high levels of dietary calcium in a 24-hour period had higher rates of fat oxidation that day than those who consumed lesser amounts. So stock up on low-fat versions of cheese, milk and yogurt; if you’re lactose intolerant, choose dark-green leafy vegetables, legumes and almonds.<br>  <br>  Go nuts! Eating a handful of almonds was found to help test subjects lose 62% more weight, 56% more fat and 50% more from their waistline after 24 weeks compared to those who followed the same diet without almonds.<br>  <br>  SUPPLEMENTATION<br>  <br>  Invest in a fat-burner. Consult your doctor before trying a fat-burner if you have any pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma or high blood pressure, as fat-burners can exacerbate those conditions. New products that combine multiple ingredients, such as Hydroxycut Hardcore and Lipid Fx, work well.<br>  <br>  Have a tea party. Green tea, in beverage or capsule form, is a reliable fat-burning aid and is generally safe for most people.<br>  <br>  Caffeinate. Drinking coffee before cardio will cause you to burn more fat. Subjects who consumed 300 mg of caffeine two hours before exercising on a stationary bike for 30 minutes were not only able to work out at a higher intensity (more total calories burned) but they also used a much greater percentage of body fat for fuel.<br>  <br>  Aminos work, too. Researchers found that subjects who ingested about 3 grams of an amino acid mixture before one hour of moderate-intensity exercise on a stationary bike burned the same amount of total calories but more fat than those taking a placebo drink.<br>  <br>  The Transporter. Carnitine, which helps transport fats to where they can be burned in the mitochondria of muscle and other cells, can help you burn more fat. One study showed that three weeks of carnitine supplementation increased carnitine levels in muscle and enhanced fat usage during exercise. Another study showed that just 10 days of carnitine supplementation (3 grams per day) increased the amount of fat burned.<br>  <br>  Fat for fuel faster. Hydroxycitrate (HCA) appears to enhance fat loss, according to researchers. Subjects taking HCA were able to work out longer and harder, and the amount of calories they burned from fat during the hour of exercise increased. Try taking 250–1,000 mg once or twice a day.<br>  <br>  Builder/burner. Creatine not only helps build muscle but can aid in body fat loss. Soldiers who took creatine (as opposed to the group that got a placebo) increased strength and muscle mass, but also averaged a 0.5% reduction in body fat percentage, with several subjects dropping more than 1% body fat.<br>  <br>  Take CLA. Conjugated linoleic acid has come into vogue in bodybuilding circles as a fat-burner. Several studies in humans have shown modest effects on fat loss. Try 3 grams per day.<br>  <br>  MOTIVATION<br>  <br>  Recruit a partner. Weight training with the right partner can help push and motivate you beyond what you’d achieve on your own. He or she can also be a positive and healthy source of competition, if that’s a characteristic that helps drive you in accomplishing specific goals.<br>  <br>  Discipline. Tired of how you look? Then understand you’re the only one who can change it. Resolve to do it and do it. Create a plan and carry it out, budgeting time for the gym, food prep and rest for the week.<br>  <br>  But be flexible. While you should be rigid about your workout times and food intake, don’t lock yourself into lofty goals such as “I will lose 10 pounds in my first two weeks.” You’re setting yourself up for a fall. Instead, aim to shed up to 2 pounds per week after weeks 4–5. Anything earlier or greater than that should be the fat-free icing on your cake!<br>  <br>  Be a fitness nerd. Watch and read everything you can get your hands on (such as Muscle & Fitness) to learn more about the body, exercise and nutrition. The more you know, the better off you’ll be in the gym.<br>  <br>  Join a league or run a race. Many people lack the drive to keep to a regular routine. Giving yourself a reason to get into shape (or stay that way) is a great way to stay on course with your goals. Signing up for a 10K or joining a league in your favorite sport is often motivation enough not to miss your next gym session.<br>  <br>  Cheat. To avoid going insane with anger over what you can or can’t eat, allow yourself 1–2 cheat meals per week, depending on how dedicated you can be. Small indulgences make dieting more tolerable, keeping you on track longer.<br>  <br>  Stay the course. The watchword for taking off that extra layer of body fat is consistency. Stick with it, even if the first week or two are tough — by the third week, you’ll start to form a habit.<br>  <br>  Be goal-oriented. To succeed, keep track of your goals. Make them attainable, and write them down to increase your chances of success. Set small goals — such as dropping 5 pounds or losing 2 inches off your waist — that are measurable and attainable. Once you hit those goals, set new ones to keep yourself motivated.<br>  <br>  Picture this. Get motivated by hanging up a picture of yourself today next to one from a magazine of what you want to look like. Dream big, but be realistic: You can have a far-improved physique in a month, but more dramatic changes take more time.<br>  <br>  Chart progress. Weigh yourself naked just once per week, at the same time of day, preferably on the same scale to ensure accuracy.<br>  <br>  email me at jgomez3582@yahoo.com for more advice etc.<br>  <br>  BA in Health and Fitness, Certifed Personal Trainer, Wellness Specialist with the YMCA|`|AA10949835	I would like to know too!|`|f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	The following healthy living recommendations will help you if you’re trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:<br>  <br>  *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF).

Please keep in mind the following when looking for a new diet plan:<br>  <br>  Every year Americans invest billions of dollars in weight loss diets and gimmicks, many of which yield few results. However, the lure of quick, easy weight loss is hard to resist. Despite ineffective tools, most hopeful consumers are willing to give the next weight loss fad a chance. If you're planning to start a new diet, it is important to remember the following information.<br>  Food-specific diets: Have you ever tried the cabbage diet or the fruit-only diet? These are just a couple of examples of diets that promote one "specific" food that causes weight loss. No matter how much you think you'll enjoy ice cream at every meal, inevitably you will get bored with eating the same food repeatedly. As a result, you'll eat less food than needed to maintain your weight. This type of diet will not teach you healthier eating habits or provide a balance of nutrients, and consequently is not effective for long-term weight loss.<br>  <br>  High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets: One of the most recent trends in dieting, these diets are based on the concept that carbohydrates are "bad" and that everyone has some degree of insulin resistance, resulting in poor carbohydrate metabolism. Many proponents of these diets suggest that including carbohydrates in your diet will cause weight gain. The reality, though, is that eating more calories (whether as carbohydrate, fats, or protein) than you burn will cause weight gain.<br>  <br>  High-fiber, low-calorie diets:  Fiber-rich foods play an important role in a healthy diet. They are a helpful ingredient of weight loss efforts because they provide bulk to the diet, which helps you feel fuller sooner. Be careful, though: if you plan to increase the fiber in your diet, be sure to increase your fluid intake at the same time or you may experience cramping, bloating, and constipation. High-fiber diets will help with weight loss only if you restrict calories in conjunction with addition of extra grains, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  Liquid diets: Consumers face a couple of different liquid diet options. Your local grocery store and pharmacy sell over-the-counter liquid meal replacements, which can be expensive and frequently add extra calories to daily consumption if not managed carefully. On the other hand are liquid diets that require medical supervision. These diets are usually very low in calories and may result in metabolic abnormalities if dieters are not carefully monitored. Neither type of liquid diet should be used for long-term weight loss unless monitored by a health care professional. Radically changing your caloric intake in this way will not result in long-term behavior modification and healthy eating patterns.<br>  <br>  Fasting: As a way to cleanse the body or jump-start a weight-loss program, fasting has been recommended for years. However, all that fasting really does is deprive your body of nutrients and decrease your energy, leaving you feeling weak and lightheaded. If the right nutrients are not available for your cells to use as energy, your liver will convert fat stores to ketones for use as energy (ketosis). Long-term ketosis can be harmful to your health. <br>  No fad diet or gimmick will work magic for safe and effective weight loss. The following are some suggestions for ensuring a long-term healthy eating plan and getting your weight loss efforts off to an encouraging start: <br>  Eat a variety of foods. Remember, a balanced diet will ensure that you get all necessary nutrients. <br>  <br>  Get some physical activity every day. Calories in must be less than calories out to ensure successful weight loss. To keep "calories out" at a healthful level, make you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.<br>  <br>  Include sources of fiber in your diet. They will add bulk and give you a feeling of fullness.<br>  <br>  Choose a diet low in fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol. You do need to consume some fat for good health. Aim for no more than 30 percent of your total calories as fat calories, of which no more than 10 percent should be saturated fat calories.<br>  <br>  Choose foods moderate in sugars. Foods that are high in simple sugars usually offer little nutritional value and will add unwanted calories.<br>  <br>  Choose foods moderate in salt and sodium. Remember that salt has been added to many foods during preparation or processing, so it's not necessary to add extra salt at the table.

AA11236050	The Basics<br>  <br>  "The shot" is an injectable progestin-only prescription method of reversible birth control. It contains a hormone that is similar to the progesterone made by a woman's ovaries to regulate the menstrual cycle. The shot is also known as DMPA. The D stands for "depot," the solution in which the hormone is suspended. The hormone is medroxyprogesterone acetate. The common brand name for the DMPA shot is Depo-Provera.<br>  <br>  A shot of DMPA can prevent pregnancy for 12 weeks. It<br>  <br>  <br>  usually, prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation)<br>  <br>  less often, thickens cervical mucus to prevent sperm from joining an egg<br>  <br>  alters the lining of the uterus, which, in theory, may prevent implantation of a fertilized egg<br>  <br>  Effectiveness<br>  <br>  The shot is one of the most effective reversible methods of birth control. Of every 1,000 women who use it correctly and consistently, only three will become pregnant during the first year of use. Three in 100 women will become pregnant with typical use.<br>  <br>  Protection is immediate if you take the shot during the first seven days of your period. Otherwise, use a backup method of contraception for the first week. Protection lasts for 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  The shot is not effective against sexually transmitted infections. Use a latex or female condom to reduce the risk.<br>  <br>  <br>  Advantages & Disadvantages<br>  <br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  can be used by women who cannot take estrogen<br>  <br>  can be used while breastfeeding<br>  <br>  effective for 12 weeks<br>  <br>  helps prevent cancer of the lining of the uterus<br>  <br>  no pill to take daily<br>  <br>  nothing to put in place before vaginal intercourse<br>  <br>  Disadvantages<br>  <br>  <br>  must receive shot every three months<br>  <br>  pregnancies, which very rarely occur, are more likely to be ectopic (in a fallopian tube)<br>  <br>  may not be used continuously for more than two years unless no other method is right for you<br>  <br>  takes an average of nine to 10 months — or sometimes more than a year — to get pregnant after getting the last shot<br>  <br>  Possible Side Effects<br>  <br>  Irregular bleeding is the most common side effect for women using DMPA. It is more common in the first six to 12 months of use. <br>  <br>  Periods become fewer and lighter for most women, and often stop altogether. The longer a woman uses the shot, the more likely her periods will stop. It may take up to a year for periods to return after a woman's last shot.<br>  <br>  Some women will have longer, heavier periods.<br>  <br>  Some may have increased light spotting and breakthrough bleeding.<br>  <br>  DMPA use is associated with temporary bone thinning. Talk with your health care provider about the risks. To help protect your bones, get regular exercise and get extra calcium and vitamin D — either through your diet or by using supplements.<br>  <br>  Less Common Side Effects <br>  <br>  <br>  change in sex drive<br>  <br>  change of appetite, weight gain<br>  <br>  depression<br>  <br>  hair loss, or increased hair on the face or body<br>  <br>  headache<br>  <br>  nausea<br>  <br>  nervousness, dizziness<br>  <br>  skin rash or spotty darkening of the skin<br>  <br>  sore breasts<br>  <br>  There is no way to stop the side effects of the shot c they may continue until it wears off (12–14 weeks).<br>  <br>  Warning Signs<br>  <br>  Serious problems are rare. Tell your clinician immediately if you have<br>  <br>  <br>  a new lump in your breast<br>  <br>  major depression<br>  <br>  severe pain in the stomach or abdomen<br>  <br>  unusually heavy or prolonged vaginal bleeding<br>  <br>  yellowing of skin or eyes<br>  <br>  Who Can Use the Shot?<br>  <br>  Most women can use the shot. <br>  <br>  It may be especially appropriate if you<br>  <br>  want very effective long-lasting contraception<br>  <br>  cannot take estrogen<br>  <br>  are unable to use barrier methods routinely or take a daily pill<br>  <br>  Usually women who use the shot need special medical supervision if they have<br>  <br>  <br>  current serious blood clotting conditions<br>  <br>  high blood pressure<br>  <br>  high risk for heart disease<br>  <br>  a history of severe depression<br>  <br>  liver disease, such as hepatitis, abnormal results on liver function tests, or a history of liver tumors<br>  <br>  You should not use the shot if you<br>  <br>  <br>  cannot put up with irregular bleeding or loss of your period <br>  <br>  are taking medicine for Cushing's syndrome<br>  <br>  are or might be pregnant<br>  <br>  have a known or suspected breast cancer<br>  <br>  have unexplained bleeding from the vagina<br>  <br>  want to become pregnant within the next year<br>  <br>  <br>  Women should not use the shot continuously for more than two years unless no other method is right for them. <br>  <br>  <br>  Women who use DMPA may have temporary bone thinning. It increases the longer they use DMPA. Bone growth begins again when women stop using the shot. Whether or not there is a complete recovery of bone mass is unknown.<br>  <br>  Whether or not temporary bone thinning leads to greater risk of bone fracture from osteoporosis much later in life is also unknown.<br>  <br>  To protect your bones, get regular exercise and get extra calcium and vitamin D — either through your diet or by using supplements.<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Get the Shot<br>  <br>  Your clinician will take your medical history. Depending on your medical history, you may need a partial or complete physical exam.<br>  <br>  Your clinician will give you an injection — you may have a temporary bruise.<br>  <br>  You will need an injection every 12 weeks for as long as you want to prevent pregnancy.|`|AA11716381	All those answers are side effects, and theres also things like yellow patches on your face and hair loss.<br>  <br>  I got the priscription for deop and when I picked it up I read the sheet that came with it with all the side effects and just from that I was like "Ok, absolutely not!!" and never went on it.<br>  <br>  Try birth control pills, they have very few side effects if any.

918cb9182b6c7f371bf500cf90cb29c1aa	Before you go to a psychiatrist or take any psychiatric drugs (more on that later) you should see if there is any physiological reason that you're feeling this way.<br>  <br>  The first thing I recommend you do is to make an appointment with a good medical doctor (but not a psychiatrist) to do a complete medical workup on you and a full panel of blood tests. The tests may reveal a root cause of your depression -- perhaps you have a vitamin deficiency, hormonal imbalance, lack of certain amino acids or a low-functioning thyroid. All of these things can be tested for and treated. Perhaps, once you have all of that corrected you won't need to take anything for your depression because the underlying cause will be corrected. Safe Harbor runs a website with a directory of holistic medical practitioners who will help you find the root cause of your depression: <a href="http://www.alternativementalhealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternativementalhealth.com</a><br>  <br>  If you do that, and your doctor finds all of your tests came back normal or if you start taking some supplements prescribed by your doctor but still don't feel markedly better then you may want to consider talking to your doctor about taking some herbs. Here are some herbs that you may find helpful:<br>  <br>  Kava (Piper methysticum) is a member of the pepper family that has been cultivated by Pacific Islanders for over 3000 years for use as a social and ceremonial drink. The first description of kava came to the west with Captain James Cook, who traveled through the South Seas in a number of celebrated voyages. To this day, when village elders or others in the Pacific Islands come together for a significant meeting, they begin with an elaborate kava ceremony. Currently, kava is used in Europe and increasingly in the United States to treat stress, anxiety, and insomnia.<br>  <br>  Valerian: Nature's valium. Another favorite for the treatment of anxiety is valerian. Derived from the dried rhizomes and roots of this tall plant, which grows in wet soil in many countries, valerian has been used for thousands of years as a folk remedy. As a natural relaxant, it is useful for several disorders including restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, menstural problems, and "nervous" stomach. Valerian acts on the brain's GABA receptors to produce a tranquilizing action that is similar to Valium-type drugs, but without the same side effects.<br>  <br>  St. John's Wort: Wonder Weed. Imagine an antidepressant that is as effective as prescription drugs but has mild side effects, if any, and even boosts libido. Sound like a fantasy? It's not. You've just met St. John's Wort, an herb taken by many thousands of people every day. In fact, in Europe, Hypericum perforatum is prescribed by doctors five times as often as Prozac.<br>  <br>  You can take herbs on your own without discussing it with your doctor or an herbalist (they're available even at the corner drug store as well as on the internet and in health food store) But I recommend taking herbs under the supervision of a doctor or herbalist to make sure that you're taking the herbs and dosages that are right for you. I'll give you the website for the American Herbalists Guild: <a href="http://www.americanherbalistsguild.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanherbalistsguild.com</a> Or if you really would like to see a psychiatrist, there aren't a lot of good ones but one who's awesome is located in Pacific Palisades California and I believe you can get medical advice from her by email (for a fee) Dr. Cass's website is listed below. Dr. Cass, unlike most psychiatrists, is an orthomolecular psychiatrist who has extensive knowledge of herbal remedies and tries to avoid psychiatric labelling of people.<br>  <br>  However, I recommend against seeing a psychiatrist.  Psychiatrists do no tests and the drugs they prescribe are very dangerous:<br>  <br>  Psychiatrists claim that a person “needs” a drug to combat their “chemical imbalance” in the brain which is causing a person’s “mental disorder.” However, the concept that a brain-based, chemical imbalance underlies mental illness is false. While popularized by heavy public marketing, it is simply psychiatric wishful thinking. As with all of psychiatry’s disease models, it has been thoroughly discredited by researchers.<br>  <br>  In 1996, psychiatrist David Kaiser said, “...modern psychiatry has yet to convincingly prove the genetic/biologic cause of any single mental illness...Patients [have] been diagnosed with ‘chemical imbalances’ despite the fact that no test exists to support such a claim, and...there is no real conception of what a correct chemical balance would look like.”<br>  <br>  And if you're interested in reading about traditional psychiatry and why the drugs it prescribes are dangerous check out the Citizens Commission on Human Rights website at <a href="http://www.cchr.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.cchr.org</a> They're the foremost human rights organization documenting psychiatric abuse and advocating for psychiatric reform.|`|AA11491405	Analyze the caliber of depression|`|AA10528532	my best advice would to be to see a psychiatris they would be able to tell you just by talking to you|`|0a8c518ba474cc03cb078b041709abacaa	It's a matter of time.

You should be more concerned with your percent body fat, not your weight.<br>  5. the best, most effective way or burning fat is by combining weight-training and cardio exercise.  The more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism will be.  You will burn more calories all day long, including while you sleep.  A health body fat percentage for males is 7-18%, females 18-24% (approximate numbers). <br>  6. you should eat 6-8 small meals each day - this will prevent you from eating 3 large meal which will slow your metabolism while  your body works to digest the large quantity of food.<br>  <br>  As a general rule of thumb, you should be weight-training 3-4 times per week and performing cardio 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Consider hiring a personal trainer (ISSA certified) and a nutritionist.

Why have they denied doing the surgery? If it is elective, they don't want to subject you to unnecessary things like an operation, chance of infection, complications of anesthesia, etc. Also, it is ultimately up to the DOCTOR to decide if you need the surgery. The hospital is only the provider of a bed for recovery and the operating suite. Sometimes they want a second opinion from another doc; depends on whether you get to pick or the facility does. ALso depends on your age. Hips tend to last only about 5 to 10 years. Generally they want to wait until you cannot do you activities of daily living - dressing, cleaning, cooking, walking, stuff like that. If you and your doc have a legitimate reason why this should be done and meet all the criteria for it, then your doc can write to Midi Cal and ask to have the case reviewed. Work with the doc!! It is the only sure-fire way to get anywhere. And the hospital is only perceived as dragging their feet.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Studies have found that virgin coconut oil increases metabolism and weight loss, and recent research has found that consuming coconut oil actually reduces cholesterol.

If you eat a burrito and a soda for lunch, eat half of a burrito, and replace the soda with either water, or iced tea. Take all soda's and all sugar out of your diet and you'll see the pounds come off. Also, did you know that it takes almost 72 hours to digest 1 slice of bread? Oh yeah!

This is how I did it:<br>  For breakfast and lunch most mornings I had a serving of Danon plain yogurt.  I didn't have any snacks.  For dinner I had whole milk with a serving of whatever was made that night, which always included meat.  There wasn't anything laying around that I could eat, which definately helped, but you just have to tell yourself no.  The first thing I did in the morning was stretching and some ballet and pilates exercises.  Later in the day, I would do some bicep curls (1 or 2 sets of 50 reps with 4lb weights- girls don't need more than that for bicep curls) and shoulder pressing. <br>  Here is how to do crunches:<br>  1.  Get down on your back on a floor or mat with your knees bent<br>  2.  With your hands at your ears, behind your head, or drawn up at your chest contract your abs<br>  3.  After you contract your abs, crunch them- go farther than just contracting them<br>  You want your shoulder blades off the floor<br>  It really is simple!  When I didn't workout, I went on a mile brisk walk/jog.  If you are having problems resisting candy or food, you should brush your teeth (it works!) or chew some gum!<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  ALSO:  Cut out the sodas!  I PROMISE this helps!!!  Just drink ice water or milk!  Sodas really make me feel bloated afterwards, so I never drink them, and I lost plenty of weight!  You may not even notice that you feel really full, but after you stop you will notice it!
8263914d08820cebc95a11385938cd15aa	In their article, "Winning by a Neck," zoologists Robert Simmons (Uppsala University) and Lue Scheepers (Ministry of Environment, Namibia) agree with Gould that the standard account "may be no more than a tall story". According to the competition hypothesis, giraffes use their long necks to advantage during dry seasons, when food is scarce; but, in fact, the opposite is observed in the field. "In the Serengeti," Simmons and Scheepers note, "giraffe spend almost all of the dry season feeding from low Grewia bushes, while only in the wet season do they turn to tall Acacia tortillis trees, when new leaves are ...plentiful ...and no competition is expected. This behavior is contrary to the prediction that giraffe should use their feeding height to advantage at times of food scarcity". Moreover, they report, "females spend over 50% of their time feeding with their necks horizontal [a behavior so common it is used to determine the sex of animals at a distance]" and "both sexes feed faster and most often with their necks bent". These observations, they conclude, suggest "that long necks did not evolve specifically for feeding at higher levels.  <br>  <br>  p.s. with all due respect, this question should be under pet categories. :  )|`|AA11615820	girraffes are herbavors... that means plant eaters... where they live the best tasteing plants are the leaves off of trees... there necks are so long so they can reach the best tasteing leaves<br>  <br>  girraffes cant cough... they dont have the ability... just thought you would like to know that bit of info to go with the rest|`|418a2b472133d48c017eaa1920e59062aa	Actually in the past there are short neck and long neck giraffes but over the years those short neck giraffes are unable to survive.The long neck giraffes are able to reproduce as they are able to reach for the taller trees.This is the fit of the survival.|`|721ce51edef3ab211374c58df609316baa	in order to get their food. which are leaves mostly of acacia (tree)|`|cca98cea494015f9dc64e2a94b05f2dfaa	to give themselves sexual pleasures|`|fa42d468a982ab58c3b94c5b103848bbaa	There is lot of animals eating grass and small palnt which is below 1 metre<br>  so god create giraffe with neck long to eat the leaves from tree

No solamente debes evitar  lo que tenga peque?as semillas( como kiwis, pasas de uva, tomates, etc...) sino los que tengan cascaritas como las legumbres( lentejas, arvejas), nueces  y cacahuetes. Los tomates deben pelarse y  quitarles las semillas. El abuso de bebidas alcohólicas tampoco ayuda.<br>  Bueno, teniendo paciencia y cuidados , los divertículos pueden ir desapareciendo( o sea se van cerrando esas peque?ísimas bolsitas).

Estos bolsillos en general aparecen en la parte del intestino llamado el colon. Los bolsillos, que se llaman divertículos, se parecen a peque?os pulgares o globos que sobresalen del costado del colon. <br>  <br>  La diverticulosis es una condición común. Pues aparece en personas mayores de edad entre los 55 y 60 a?os.<br>  <br>  ?Qué la causa? <br>  Aparentemente la causa principal de la formación de divertículos es la falta de fibra en la dieta. La fibra es un ingrediente de las frutas, verduras y granos que el cuerpo no puede digerir. La fibra ayuda a ablandar las heces y facilita su paso por el intestino. Ayuda a prevenir el estre?imiento. Cuando está estre?ido tiene que hacer esfuerzo para que pasen las heces duras por el intestino. El aumento de presión causado por el esfuerzo puede hacer que los puntos débiles del colon se inflen y formen divertículos. <br>  <br>  ?Cuáles son los síntomas? <br>  En general la diverticulosis no causa síntomas. Cuando hay síntomas, el más común es el dolor abdominal. El dolor normalmente se encuentra en la parte inferior izquierda del abdomen. Puede sentir dolor la mayor parte del tiempo, o puede ir y venir. También puede tener más gas o estre?imiento. <br>  <br>  La diverticulosis también puede provocar un sangrado sin dolor en el recto. El sangrado es menos común que otros síntomas. <br>  <br>  Cuando el área de las bolsas o a su alrededor se inflama o se infecta, se llama diverticulitis. Si tiene fiebre y dolor abdominal, es posible que haya desarrollado la diverticulitis. Si esto sucede, debe consultar a su profesional médico. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo se diagnostica? <br>  Su profesional médico le hará preguntas sobre su historia clínica y lo examinará. Es posible que le haga algunos análisis. <br>  <br>  Los divertículos se ven mejor con un aparato de rayos x especial para el intestino llamado enema de bario. De hecho la diverticulitis se puede descubrir cuando va a esta prueba por algún otro problema médico. El bario se pone en su recto y su colon. El bario luego muestra el perfil del intestino grueso en los rayos x. <br>  <br>  La sigmoidoscopía es otro procedimiento que puede encontrar divertículos. El doctor inserta un endoscopio en su recto, el cual es un tubo delgado, flexible e iluminado. Luego el doctor puede ver dentro de su intestino grueso. Dependiendo de sus síntomas, es posible que le hagan también una colonoscopía para ver si hay divertículos. El colonoscopio es un tubo más largo. Con él su profesional médico puede ver una parte más grande del intestino que con el sigmoidoscopio. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo se trata? <br>  Lo más importante es que necesita tener más fibra en su dieta. Puede hacerlo comiendo más productos de grano entero, como trigo entero y pan, cereales y panecillos de salvado. También coma más frutas y verduras. Además, pueden ser útiles los complementos dietéticos altos en fibra. <br>  <br>  Evite comer alimentos que se puedan irritar o atorar en los divertículos, como las palomitas de maíz, semillas de girasol, semillas de sésamo, y nueces. <br>  <br>  Si tiene diverticulosis, siempre debe cuidarse de los síntomas. Vea de inmediato a su profesional médico si tiene fiebre y dolor abdominal. <br>  <br>  ?Cuánto duran los efectos? <br>  Las bolsas en la pared del colon son permanentes. Los síntomas provocados por estas bolsas pueden ir y venir. Cuando tenga síntomas, pueden durar algunos días o más. Muchas veces se pueden prevenir los síntomas siguiendo una dieta saludable, tomando bastante aqua y realizando suficientes actividades físicas. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo puedo ayudar a prevenir la diverticulosis? <br>  La mejor manera de tratar de evitar la diverticulosis es hacer las cosas que le ayuden a que sus evacuaciones sean suaves y fáciles de pasar: <br>  <br>  Coma una dieta saludable con mucha fibra. <br>  Tome agua en abundancia. <br>  Haga ejercicios regularmente.|`|841145998b5bbc588b5575fdd4d08ec5aa	La diverticulosis es una enfermedad del colon (intestino grueso) que está asociada fuertemente con el estre?imiento y los hábitos dietéticos. Si bien, antes era una enfermedad propia de la vejez, en la actualidad cada vez hay más personas de la cuarta y quinta décadas de la vida que la están padeciendo. <br>  La diverticulosis es la prescencia de divertículos en el colon. Un divertículo es una saculación que se forma a través de la pared del colon (la mucosa y submucosa protruyen a través de la capa muscular) haciendo que la pared se debilite. Es cierto que el segmento más comunmente afectado sea el colon sigmoides y el colon descendente, localizados en la parte baja e izquierda del abdomen (fosa iliaca izquierda); pero se llegan a presentar casos de diverticulosis en casi la totalidad del colon. Los factores predisponentes o asociados con esta enfermedad son, estre?imiento crónico, resultado de malos hábitos dietéticos (bajo consumo de fibra y vegetales, alto consumo de carnes y carbohidratos), el tabaquismo, el sedentarismo y la obesidad. Cuando los divertículos ya existentes presentan inflamaciòn e infección, se llama DIVERTICULITIS, que por lo general ya causan síntomas como dolor y sangrado por las heces (hematoquecia), y a veces es tan severo el proceso que se llega a "romper" los divertículos o saculaciones causando perforaciòn intestinal y originando la salida de heces a la cavidad abdominal, terminando todo esto en una PERITONITIS, lo cual es una urgencia quirúrgica que compromete severamente la vida. El método de diagnóstico más común para confirmar la sospecha de diverticulosis es la COLONOSCOPíA o RECTOSIGMOIDOSCOPíA. Y una vez detectada la enfermedad hay alternativas de tratamiento para evitar que avance el cuadro. Todo esto depende de la edad, de la extensión de la enfermedad, del número de divertículos y de si ya ha presentado o no diverticulitis. A veces la solución es la resección del segmento de colon afectado de forma profiláctica (preventiva). Espero que haya despejado tu duda.

My wife is on the big side, and started exercising at the gym at least 3 times a week and she says she's lost weight and she feels stronger and healthier too. Aerobics are the best type to do.<br>     She has also started to stay away from high calorie foods and sweets,and is trying harder to eat wholesome meals and skip snacks.You don't need to starve yourself to lose weight, just eat in moderation and that means not overeating.<br>      Eat your biggest meal at breakfast or lunch, and make your evening meal your lightest, as you tend to burn fewer calories at night because of inactivity.<br>  Even as my wife loses weight, she is still a big boned  woman and is only going to be so small, so if your're big-boned and muscular, don't push yourself to be but so thin.

My lower retainer is permanent, so all I can say is that when I got my upper retainer, my mouth was sore, I think it was the change from constant pressure to controlling the pressure and being able to pop the retainer out, your teeth are just getting used to it.

AA12162676	First of all, find out what makes you  have a pot belly. If you are having the fatty foods, then the first thing to do is to stop having those oily foods. Drinking lots of water is another good way of reducing tummy. 8 glasses of water daily is good enough. Have it in   1 or 2 hrs interval. It will flush out the toxins. Then also its very good to have lots of fruits.|`|135513be7e2b3f3499967b66006c46efaa	The first thing to point out is that you are not to blame. Where a person tends to accumulate weight is genetically determined. Try to place your weight problem in this perspective and reduce your emotional investment in it. <br>  <br>  That said, you are right: Excess weight in the belly is much more strongly linked to diabetes and heart disease than is extra weight on the hips, thighs, buttocks or legs. Fortunately, it's usually also easier to lose. <br>  <br>  If you cut down on calories, the first pounds to come off will likely be from your belly. Combine this with exercises for toning your abdominal muscles, consulting a trainer should you need to. (When the belly protrudes even though you're thin everywhere else, conditioning the stomach muscles should really help.) Get on the treadmill, you don't have to run at 8 mph, walk slowely. If you can't afford one, go to a gym, or walk around the block. <br>  <br>  Go to Wikipedia.org and type in abs diet. Than, they will be a list of foods. <br>  <br>  Try Chocolate whey, Protein powder. <br>  <br>  By the way, There is no such thing as spot reducing, you lose it 100% evenly. <br>  <br>  I reccomend the, "Abs diet" book. <br>  <br>  Hang on there, give it time, than people will be all over you!

Good Luck  xx|`|9182978cca5f5ef6f5eb8c16075eef2caa	This summary details a major breakthrough in detoxifying the human body of the <br>  carcinogens, heavy metals, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and overall acid conditions that <br>  promote and cause disease. <br>  <br>  Some 70,000 chemicals are being dumped into our environment, 65,000 of which are <br>  potentially hazardous to our health. We live in a virtual sea of pollutants, and carry many <br>  of these toxins within us. They can be found even in unborn children. A 2004 study by <br>  the Environmental Working Group identified 287 industrial chemicals in babies’ umbilical-<br>  cord blood, including 180 known to cause cancer and 217 that are toxic to the brain and <br>  nervous system.<br>  <br>  In my research to develop a detoxification system for prospective mothers, I recently <br>  learned about a naturally occurring mineral called zeolite, which has a unique, negatively <br>  charged, crystalline structure. Zeolite is formed from the fusion of lava and ocean water, <br>  and combines all four elements. I feel that zeolite is an alchemical gift from God. It has <br>  been used for more than 800 years in Asia as a remedy for overall health and well-being, <br>  and is on the FDA’s GRAS list (generally recognized as safe). Zeolite is available <br>  commercially in a purified, activated form, in the zeolite product.<br>  <br>  The results of research on zeolite are very impressive:<br>  <br>  1. Zeolite appears to prevent and may become an important treatment for cancer. In <br>  one study, 78 percent of the 65 participants with terminal cancer (all types) are now in <br>  complete remission for 12 months (LifeLink Pharmaceuticals, 2005).<br>  <br>  2. It has a chelation-like effect in removing heavy metals (particularly lead, mercury, <br>  cadmium, and arsenic), pesticides, herbicides, PCBs, and other toxins from the body. <br>  These toxins are strongly correlated with the occurrence of a wide range of diseases, <br>  including cancers and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, autism, and dementia.<br>  <br>  3. Zeolite also improves liver function, indirectly improving elimination of pesticides, <br>  herbicides, and xeno-estrogens.<br>  <br>  4. Zeolite appears to block viral replication, and may prove to be a potent anti-viral <br>  and general remedy for all viruses. To date, 40 anecdotal cases of herpes zoster have <br>  reportedly been healed. Preliminary anecdotal case studies suggest that it may help <br>  alleviate rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis C as well as the common <br>  cold and flu.<br>  <br>  5. Zeolite’s binding power was proven during the Chernobyl disaster, when tons of it <br>  were used to remove radioactive cesium and strontium-90 before they contaminated <br>  local water systems.<br>  <br>  6. Zeolite creates a natural buffer in the system by establishing an optimal pH level <br>  (between 7.35 and 7.45), which in turn activates healthy brain function and a strong <br>  immune system.<br>  <br>  7. It shows promise as an effective detoxifier for prospective mothers. Recently, at <br>  the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center, Zeolite was added to the protocol for the 10-day <br>  detoxification program for prospective mothers.<br>  <br>  In two women who just completed the program, toxins in their breast tissue dropped <br>  significantly – from 12 in one and 13 in the other to only two – over the course of seven <br>  days.<br>  <br>  Although anecdotal evidence and centuries of use in Asia suggest that zeolite is safe to <br>  use even during pregnancy and breastfeeding, its safe use in pregnancy has not been <br>  proven in double-blind studies.<br>  <br>  8. According to testimonials, zeolite promotes a sense of well-being, clarity, and <br>  happiness. It appears to do this as a consequence of eliminating toxins and also, <br>  according to preliminary research, by increasing serotonin production. One study <br>  suggests that zeolite also helps relieve depression.<br>  <br>  9. Anecdotal reports suggest that zeolite increases energy, immune function, and <br>  general health.<br>  <br>  10. Zeolite neutralizes the formation of nitrosamines in the stomach. Found in <br>  processed meats, nitrosamines are one cause of stomach cancer. Another positive effect <br>  on the stomach, according to many anecdotal reports, is relief of acid reflux.<br>  <br>  11. Testimonials suggest that zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause <br>  allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.<br>  <br>  12. Zeolite directly absorbs free radicals and thus decreases free radical activity and <br>  damage to the body.<br>  <br>  Contraindications:<br>  <br>  NCD is contraindicated for anyone taking a medication containing heavy metals (such <br>  as lithium) or platinum (which is found in some cancer medications).<br>  <br>  NCD may remove from the body supplemental lithium and the chemotherapy agents <br>  cisplatin and carboplatin, both of which contain platinum.<br>  <br>  It appears to be safe to begin or resume taking NCD 3 days after using cisplatin and <br>  carboplatin, and 2 days after using other chemotherapies. If you wish to use NCD <br>  while taking lithium, consult your physician. If you are an insulin-dependent diabetic, <br>  be aware that NCD may lower your need for insulin.<br>  <br>  Visit my website to purchase at wholesale price www. zeolitesfordetox/davidlawrence or buy it from another site I just hope it helps, I have more sites for you to visit if you want, dont bother searching as I have already done that, I have the best information.

7fa06d2071e4af77aa4b15ab26921ed1aa	To increase muscle mass, you need to put your body under strain, therefore doing heavy weights and little repititions such as 5 reps, wait 3 minutes, do 5 reps again until you can't do anymore.<br>  I do 10 sets of rep's everynight & increase the number of reps each week.<br>  Doing lots of repititions using light weights doesn't put your muscles under pressure therefore it doesn't increase your muscle mass.<br>  If you wan't more muscle, remember to eat protein for muscle growth and repair.<br>  The aim is to eat  the amount of protein (in grams) per kgilo's you weigh.<br>  For example, I weigh 53 kilograms, therefore I aim to eat 53 grams of protein a day to keep my muscles up to scratch & to repair and prepare them for another day of weights.<br>  High protein sources are fish, chicken, nuts, legumes.<br>  I find eating baked beans every morning is a great source of protein (although it does do some work to your bowel... gas wise...).

The symptom is usually associated with the common cold, but can also be found in patients with middle ear infections, tonsillitis, sinusitis or an adenoid infection. Some people have chronic blockages, so it is as if they always have a cold.<br>  <br>  I suspect you might need to see your doc.

Generally speaking, if the cyst is benign, it is removed using a technique called laparoscopy. In case of a benign cyst, it should not affect futuer pregnancies.

So the best answer will come from the doctor.|`|AA11322453	Your gynaecologist will tell you the chances you stand, after you have the cyst removed.

a60102fe4c6966877ff84e49ec9c9b9caa	Anything can upset your cycle: stress, illness and some medications to name several.  Certain antibiotics can also<br>  cause birth control pills to be less effective.  Three days isn't that late so you probably don't have to worry about pregnancy yet.  The antibiotics given for a UTI are not likely to cause problems with a pregnancy.   Many women develop UTI's when they are pregnant and doctors give them antibiotics.  Pregnancy tests don't cost much and are even available at dollar stores, so if you are really worried, go ahead and get one.  The doctor probably didn't test your urine for pregnancy - just for UTI's unless you showed signs of being pregnant.  Usually they will tell you if they are doing a pregnancy test.|`|ee1c0c1d4321045630054dc29dc543a6aa	I can almost guarantee that they ran a pregnancy test on you before dispensing the antibiotics.<br>  Call and ask.<br>  Make sure..<br>  Most antibiotics they give for UTI's are safe, due to the fact that some are pregnant.<br>  At my hospital it is required that we do a preg screen<br>  Call them and ask to check.|`|AA11299527	Having a UTI can make you late, but you should take a pregnancy test just to be sure.

Usually when a person has an NG tube in, gastric fluid that is lost is replaced with IV fluid that has electrolytes in it.  If a patient were to drink water, then the measured output from the NG tube would be inaccurate thereby you risk over-replacing them with fluid and lytes that they may not need.

Just stand straight up with weights in your hands. your arms just straight down. and pull the weight straight up without bending your elbows or extending your shoulders in any way.

El desfibrilador cardioversor implantable (DCI) trata de convertir el ritmo anormal en un ritmo normal, liberando un choque eléctrico hacia el corazón, acción que se denomina desfibrilación.<br>  <br>  Un DCI puede prevenir la muerte cardíaca súbita y está compuesto de varias partes:<br>  <br>  Un generador de pulso que envía un choque potente al corazón y funciona con pilas. El generador se implanta debajo de la piel, generalmente en el lado superior izquierdo del pecho. <br>  Un tablero electrónico que le dice al dispositivo cuándo “disparar” el choque. <br>  Electrodos (alambres) que pasan a través de las venas del corazón y conectan dicho órgano con el resto del dispositivo. Los alambres perciben los latidos cardíacos y llevan el choque al músculo cardíaco. <br>  Todos los desfibriladores cardioversores implantables tienen un marcapasos incorporado. La regulación del ritmo puede ser necesaria para brindarle apoyo al corazón en algunos casos, por ejemplo, después de un shock o durante latidos cardíacos muy lentos. El marcapasos también le permite al dispositivo corregir algunos latidos cardíacos rápidos, regulando el ritmo incluso más rápido durante un período de tiempo corto. Además, todos los marcapasos biventriculares actualmente pueden funcionar como un DCI.<br>  <br>  El DCI permanentemente controla los latidos cardíacos para asegurarse de que sean normales y sólo libera un choque al corazón cuando percibe un ritmo potencialmente mortal.<br>  <br>  Durante la implantación de un DCI tipo marcapaso, los electrodos se insertan a través de las venas en el corazón y el generador de pulso es enterrado quirúrgicamente bajo la piel del pecho, generalmente debajo de la clavícula izquierda|`|74e8bb58d5b5d641e975478d4e80f5ebaa	Aqui tienes todo sobre un desfibrilador, tipos, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drscope.com/privados/pac/anestesia/a1/p48.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drscope.com/privados/pac/anes...</a>|`|2cac610f83362f92ded3ef2faa48098daa	Es un aparato qe es emplea en paradas cardio respiratorias.

fc5839cd3ee629a9e7e63ed6974f312faa	You may sometimes see small specks or clouds moving in your field of vision. They are called floaters. You can often see them when looking at a plain background, like a blank wall or blue sky. Floaters are actually tiny clumps of gel or cells inside the vitreous, the clear jelly-like fluid that fills the inside of your eye.<br>  <br>  Floaters may look like specks, strands, webs or other shapes. Actually, what you are seeing are the shadows of floaters cast on the retina, the light-sensitive part of the eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment for Spots and Floaters<br>  Most spots and eye floaters are merely annoying but harmless when they temporarily enter the field of vision, and many fade over time. People sometimes are interested in surgery to remove floaters, but doctors are willing to perform such surgery only in rare instances.<br>  <br>  If you suddenly see new floaters, or eye floaters accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, it could indicate serious conditions such as diabetic retinopathy; vascular abnormalities such as retinal hemorrhages or carotid artery disease, or the beginning of a retinal detachment. The retina can tear if the shrinking vitreous gel pulls away from the wall of the eye. This sometimes causes a small amount of bleeding in the eye that may appear as new floaters. You should see your eye doctor immediately. <br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/spotsfloats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions...</a>|`|AA10654139	yea everybody has that but you dont notice unless you are paying attention or as you say staring|`|1XwRGCOqaa	yea i've stared at the sky and seen dots moving around...i heard it was the satelites moving around the world|`|AA10553391	they are blood vesseld and blood cells traveling through the eye thats all your not seeing space aliens or anything.|`|AA10628651	What are you smoking?|`|nMHFcsQXaa	either their particles, or i heard it means you need some water.<br>  Im not too sure, but i think it means water

AA12200754	due to drops in the level of calcium in their body, men's bones begin to degenerate.  over a period of time this can cause one bone to collapse and press upon another bone.  eventually the weight of this compression causes other bones to more easily collapse.  thus, men become shorter|`|84e3267504eea1bf89bf550ce051e4f9aa	sad but true, you do get shorter as you get older.  the spine starts to compress.  by age forty, you'll be at least an inch shorter than in high school.

9443f42159cd254817f75e712e9e6c54aa	I actually saw a Dateline or 20/20 a long time ago, where they had two sisters try herbal breast enhancement pills. It DID work for one of the sisters, but did not for the other. The whole thing with these pills is that if your breasts stopped growing before they were supposed to (and there's no way to know except try), they will work. However, if they grew to their potential, the pills won't work. I would steer clear of creams. If you decide to try them, I would rate different kinds and see which get the best reviews. Maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones.|`|AA10669573	sorry, there are no breast enhancement drugs, only surgery

There are treatments, for breast cancer now, and I know of many survivors, one a most recent one is a Nun, a Sister in our Parish, she is young and and is doing very well. I understand that you must be shocked by this news. however your Mom will need you very much and your support on her journey to recovery and survival. Gather your strength ask for prayer and be at her side as your Mom will need you and all your family members for support. Yes indeed there are many Breast cancer survivors, Just think of Mrs Betty Ford. and many more here in our area, that are not well known. My prayers are with your Mom and your family God bless you .|`|lynmeenmaa	hun im so sorry.<br>  best wishes ok and good luck.<br>  x|`|AA12066269	As everyone has already said, breast cancer is treatable.  It is scary to be diagnosed with it or to have your mom, or sister diagnosed with it.  I had it 4 years ago and my sister had it 14 years ago and my best friend had it 7 years ago.<br>  <br>  Treatment depends on what your mom and her doctors decide and is also based on the type and stage of the cancer.  Some types of breast cancer, if caught early enough can be resolved only with surgery. (My sister's case)  Sometimes surgery and radiation, (my girlfriends case) and I had surgery, chemo and radiation. Also if the cancer is hormone receptive medication (pills) may be taken for several years to help keep the cancer from returning.<br>  <br>  There are some very good websites you can check out to learn more about breast cancer and current treatments.<br>  <br>  The Susan Komen Foundation is a very good place to start.<br>  <br>  Please remember you and your mom don't have to do this alone.  If you ever want to talk to someone, please email me.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	In some cases it can be gotten rid of, but it may come back.<br>  Just love your Mom and help her with anything you can.

Check out Live Strong.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Malignant means it is cancerous, as opposed to a benign lump which is non-cancerous.<br>  <br>  There are lots of treatments for breast cancer, most involve surgery to remove the lump followed by taking tablets or sometimes having radiotherapy.|`|AA11349925	Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that! the hospital will take good care of her and ensure she recieves the best treatment possible.

I intend to live and get rid of it.  In many cases breast cancer is cureable.  Malignant just means its cancer, nothing more.<br>  <br>  How your mom will do depends on a lot of things.  She will go through some tough treatment.  But there are lots of people who survive it.  I am responding to treatment and intend to be a survivor.  There are a lot of them.  Your mom could be too.  Don't give up hope - breast cancer is very treatable.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mom - tell her you love her and have her share what she knows with you.

Speaking of, it's probably best to eat whatever you want if it is whole (doesn't come in a package). If you can't manage that, then at least eat normal foods but in good portions. Don't over eat. The French don't go on diets, yet they are all thin, not like Americans whose majority are obese.|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	it's a lot of carbs.  you also need more fruits/veggies.  as for losing weight, I don't know how this would help/not help but it's not a balanced diet.|`|XkmqZ07Daa	Not enough.Your metabolism needs food.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	Here is a good basic guideline to use if you are going to "count calories"<br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb; to lose 1 pound you need to burn 3500 calories more than you consume. Thus to lose a pound a week, you must burn 500 calories a day more than you eat. 500x7=3500<br>  <br>  Search for a exercise calorie chart online like this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutristrategy.com/activitylist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutristrategy.com/activitylis...</a><br>  <br>  and calculate your calories burned.  Then log your foods daily and you'll have a great tool for success. Loseit.com has a great tool for this. If you have an Iphone even better! You only need to log your stuff once a day to figure it all out. after 7 days you'll have the system you need.<br>  <br>  Just a couple of quick notes:<br>  <br>  1. If you try going fat free (or very very lowfat) you'll find you can eat a lot of food (quantity/volume wise) with out taking on too many calories. Fat accounts for 1/2 the calories in most foods! I snack all day on fruits, veggies, fat free yogurt, pretzels and still make calories budgets set by calculators found on places like loseit.com<br>  <br>  2. It is better to take in more calories, and exercise, than less with no exercise to achieve the result of weight loss. Cutting back too many calories and you'll be sluggish, tired and weak in day to day routines.<br>  <br>  3. It is better to eat more times in smaller amounts. This way your body increases it's average metabolic rate. I eat fat free snacks literally all day and very small meals for lunch and dinner.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KUWDICSVaa	Your caloric intake is low, but you are missing a bunch of nutrients and enzymes (which are essential to sculpting a dancer's body).

No. But it's not healthy food, either. You wouldn't lose weight effectively with that diet. You should know that weight loss doesn't only depend on calorie intake but what's in those calories.
769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	The autistic savant is one of the most fascinating cognitive phenomena in psychology. "Autistic savant" refers to individuals with autism who have extraordinary skills not exhibited by most persons.<br>  <br>  There are many forms of savant abilities. The most common forms involve mathematical calculations, memory feats, artistic abilities, and musical abilities. A mathematical ability which many autistic individuals display is calendar memory. They could be asked a question like: 'What day of the week was May 22, 1961? and they can determine the answer within seconds--Monday. Others can multiply and divide large numbers in their head and can also calculate square roots and prime numbers without much hesitation.<br>  <br>  Examples of some memory feats include: remembering everything about presidents (birth/death, term in office, names and birth dates of family members, cabinet members, etc.), memorizing the U.S. highway system, and remembering everyone's birth date, even after meeting the person once and not seeing him/her for 20 years.<br>  <br>  Some autistic individuals with savant abilities are incredible artists. Dr. Rimland's son, Mark, is quickly establishing himself as an excellent watercolor artist. A child named Nadia drew beautiful pictures of horses, and her drawings have been compared to those of Rembrandt. Interestingly, she lost her drawing abilities when she started to learn to speak. Another artist with autism, Richard Wawro, who was described in an issue of Reader's Digest, is legally blind and draws in crayons. His works sell for up to $10,000 and even the Pope owns one of his paintings.<br>  <br>  Music is another common savant ability. Many performers with autism have perfect pitch and also have a great memory for music. In some cases, a person can hear a classical piece once and play it back in its entirety. <br>  <br>  Not all people with autism have savant abilities but when they do, it's a talent that makes you say, "Wow!"

Doing this consistently actually changes the wiring in the brain and you'll get fewer and fewer of these random thoughts.<br>  (Trying to block the thought actually makes it stick around longer.)|`|0e03b75f78e59e67dc8d89c0bb425808aa	fill your head with good thoughts to replace the bad ones read your bible and mmeditate on gods word, you will benifit from it|`|AA10326530	You do not forget about them, and you do not fight them, otherwise they become more.

VBupHoPlaa	Probally see a doctor just to be safe.  I would say it's probably not a wart though.  Maybe an infection.|`|AA10826614	Is it painful?<br>  <br>  It could possibly be a tick bite. <br>  <br>  If you are certain it is indeed a wart:<br>      *  Applying salicylic acid--You can treat warts on places such as the hands, feet or knees by putting salicylic acid (one brand name: Compound W) on the warts. To get good results, you must apply the acid every day for many weeks. After you take a bath or shower, pat your skin dry lightly with a towel. Then put salicylic acid on your warts. The acid sinks in deeper and works better when it is applied to damp skin. Before you take a shower or a bath the next day, use an emery board or pumice stone to file away the dead surface of the warts.<br>      * Duct tape treatment-- Covering a wart with duct tape may also help because it irritates the wart and the skin around it, causing the body to attack it. Cover the wart with duct tape for up to a week. Then remove the tape, soak the wart in water and rub it gently with an emery board or a pumice stone. Leave the tape off overnight, then repeat treatment until the wart goes away. If this is not successful after 2 months, see your doctor to try another approach.<br>      * Applying cantharidin--Your doctor may use cantharidin on your warts. With this treatment, the doctor "paints" the chemical onto the wart. Most people don't feel any pain when the chemical is applied to the wart. You'll experience some pain and blistering of the wart in about 3 to 8 hours. After treatment with cantharidin, a bandage is put over the wart. The bandage can be removed after 24 hours. When mixtures of cantharidin and other chemicals are used, the bandage is removed after 2 hours. When you see your doctor again, he or she will remove the dead skin of the wart. If the wart isn't gone after one treatment, your doctor may suggest another treatment.<br>      * Applying liquid nitrogen--Your doctor may use liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. This treatment is called cryotherapy. Applying liquid nitrogen to the wart causes a little discomfort. To completely remove a wart, liquid nitrogen treatments may be needed every 1 to 3 weeks for a total of 2 to 4 times. If no improvement is noted, your doctor may recommend another type of treatment.<br>      * Other treatments for warts on the skin--Your doctor can also remove warts on the skin by burning the wart, cutting out the wart or removing the wart with a laser. These treatments are stronger, but they may leave a scar. Ask your doctor about risks and benefits before you decide what kind of treatment to have for your warts.<br>  <br>  I would consult a physician first before taking any action.

e0becedcb9aea3c98215bca5a592450daa	This happens to women all the time. Factors like stress, diet, and exercise play a role in when you get your period each month. Extreme stress, severe dieting, and excessive exercising puts so much strain on your body that it doesn't want to lose nutrients by releasing menstrual fluid, so your period comes later w/ blood loss. This is no reason to give yourself extra stress, though (but don't start dieting so that you lose less bloos: its still overall VERY unhealthy for your body). Think back: maybe you were doing one of these things this year?<br>  <br>  If not, emotional stress plays a role in this too, such as nervousness or anxiety. Maybe there's some big event that you're expecting around this time? Look at all possibilities.<br>  <br>  Having intercourse can also affect your hormonal balance, which is turn changes when the egg is released each month. This does not in any way mean that you are pregnant: if you were, you would be skipping periods altogether. <br>  <br>  If you really are uncomfortable with irregular periods, then you can take birth control. However, unless you are having severe cramping or something, I don't reccomend it, because they can screw up your hormonal balance in the future. I'm sure this isn't a problem, but if you really are worried, then just talk to your gyno. I'm sure he/she will give you more answers. Hope that this helped and good luck!|`|8b9e5894f70e3364d0f2490295d49b82aa	You are probably just fine, but if you are concerned you should see your doctor and ask them what they think. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA12214843	if you're not a virgin.. you were probabely pregnant. and yes.. you should be concerned. ask your doctor.|`|xhecqFLBaa	well everyone is different. but a lot of things factor in, for instance stress, if a woman has a lot of stress in her life her period may come late. if you are truelly worried i would go see a doctor and just explain. i don't believe there is anything wrong though.|`|SmCBzBlnaa	Dont worry about it.

9nElIoMiaa	They exercise your tummy muscles... there are no exercises for making you taller.. that has to do with your parents and your genes.<br>  <br>  Crunches are great exercises for men and women. You lie on yur back with your knees up.. feet on the ground... you put your hands on your earlobes... you push your tongue on the roof of your mouth.. and you try to lift your shoulders off the ground without bouncing up... just squeeze up and slowly drop back down again. At first you might only get a little bit of your shoulders up... (and that is all you need do) ... but eventually you can rise quite high with practice. If you tummy hursts ... stop and give it a rest.. otherwise you could hurt your back.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Crunches are an exercise much like sit-ups. To do them you will need to lay on your back on a firm surface. Next you will need to bend your legs at the knees with the soles of your feet resting on the floor.The safest means of doing them calls for you to cross your arms on your chest. It is not recommended that you place your hands on the back of your head as this can lead to hyper-extension of the neck. Next just compress the abdominals as you lift your head and shoulders of the ground; as one unit, for about 1 to 2 inches. Start with 4 sets of 10 then move up in reps as you feel more comfortable.

Please have a yearly check up on both things. <br>  <br>  You can read these side effects and there is much more on the net.<br>  Side Effects <br>  Unlike the birth control pill, which provides women with a small dose of hormones on a daily basis, Depo-Provera gives women a large dose of progestin at one time. As a result, side effects of this type of contraceptive tend to be more pronounced. <br>  <br>  One of the most common side effects of Depo-Provera is the absence of menstruation during the first year of use, which affects a quarter to half of all users. About 30% of users will continue to have regular periods (which suggests that ovulation is continuing) while the remainder of women on Depo-Provera are likely to experience irregular periods. Other side effects include: <br>  <br>  Change in menstruation (may be lighter or heavier; shorter or longer) <br>  Increase in spotting and breakthrough bleeding <br>  Weight gain <br>  Dizziness <br>  Nervousness <br>  Change in libido <br>  Headaches <br>  Rash or skin discoloration <br>  Breast tenderness <br>  Depression <br>  Increase or decrease in facial and body hair <br>  Hair loss <br>  Unfortunately, little can be done about these side effects until the hormones from the shot wear off, which can take up to 14 weeks. It is also interesting to note that, because Depo-Provera tends to suppress the production of testosterone in men, male prisoners used to receive Depo-Provera shots in order to suppress their sexual drive and help make them more docile. <br>  Use of Depo-Provera has also been shown to cause a decrease in bone mass. This is most noticeable during the first year of use. While bone mass does tend to increase again once the shot is discontinued, the long term effects of the temporary bone loss is unknown and may put users at an increased risk of osteoporosis. <br>  <br>  Complications<br>  Although they are rare, there are some serious health complications that can occur with the use of Depo-Provera. Users may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer and cervical cancer, but study results have been conflicting. Other possible complications include jaundice, blood clots, severe allergic reaction and infertility. <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/guide/shot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/guide/shot.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&q=depo+shots+side+effects" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=c...</a>

r2MHR06Naa	Vaccines do not cause autism nor do they cause any other diseases as Heidi N would like you to believe.   <br>  <br>  "When adults get symptoms of autism, they call it MS, ALS, Lupus, chronic fatigue, schizophrenia, OCD, Bipolar, etc. They don't call it autism."   This statement is just total BS, I hope you don't fall for crap like this that people make up and post here.|`|8ryoShBpaa	When adults get symptoms of autism, they call it MS, ALS, Lupus, chronic fatigue, schizophrenia, OCD, Bipolar, etc.  They don't call it autism.  But, do adults gets ill from vaccines.  I did, and still struggle after 26 years of getting the German Measles booster at age 15. I also received other vaccines as an adult for work purposes, never realizing any chronic symptoms developing might come from the vaccines. I never even thought it was possible. I just went around puzzled.  <br>  <br>  Now, I know  a lot more, and I don't think I could get another vaccine unless everyone in my town started dying and it was my only hope.  I would still probably not do it since I have learned gobs now, and have found out about ALL KINDS of treatments that can kill many of these things that they get vaccinated for.  But, if you feel you have to in order to get a job, there are things you can do to prevent the vaccines from harming you.  Taking gobs of Vitamin C, and I mean gobs, and also taking Vit. A and D, and also taking things to boost your ability to remove toxins, and avoiding things that reduce your ability to remove toxins like Tylenol, plus not getting vaccines together and not getting them when sick, even with a cold, can really make a difference according to lots of reports I read. <br>  <br>  Other options are to get tested for antibody titers against the things you will be vaccinated for.  If they are already high enough, most won't require a vaccination.  You can also raise antibody titers via homeopathy and the blood test will reflect the same exact titers that the vaccine would do if your body were to respond to it correctly.  I have seen many who were vaccinated and even not vaccinated, report either very low titers or very high titers, both considered abnormal.<br>  <br>  You can goolge about the guardasil vaccince reactions to get a good feel as to the amount of people who die and become disabled after being vaccinated.  Since they are vaccinated in late childhood in large numbers, it is more easy to detect it's from the vaccines.  I think Spain has now outlawed this vaccine due to the adverse reactions they had.  The rest of the countries just keep giving them even though the reactions are being reported.  I guess people think it's ok if some die from the vaccine because some would die from the cancer.  I would rather take my chances, of course.

25eef247372ea872ddad186582a839f3aa	Ok...I would like to know as well, but I can say that before you have any children....IF your menstrual cycle is very regular....you can time it.  Example...If your cycle is every 28 days from the beginning of your period to the start of the next, then day 14 is your MOST fertile day, BUT sperm can live for 2 days....so take caution and either use a condom or spermicide OR make sure he knows and that he doesn't ejaculate even the slightest bit inside...AND I DO mean the slightest bit.  That's how I got pregnant the first time...and from there on it's history, because I breastfed...thought I was regular then my baby started to wean and oops...miscalculated 'cause weaning threw off my cycle.  Now it still works the same, say if your cycle is 32 days, then day 16 would be the peak.  I would say, give it a GOOD week around the peak day.  Three or 4 days before and 3 to 4 days after.  There is one more thing that I would suggest, if you want to stay completely away from birth control ...check out the saliva fertility monitors or any fertility monitor for that matter.  Even though they're "supposed" to be used to help one GET pregnant, you can use it for the other purpose as well.  But, I would think the disposable would get pretty expensive.  Good luck!!|`|AA11695905	Don't use the method above.  My cousin uses it and she's got 8 kids.  The only way to be sure you will not get pregnant is to either not have sex or use some type of birth control.  <br>  <br>  Here's the deal.  As soon as it happens once, it'll happen again, and again, and again.  So sooner or later you'll either need some kind of birth control or you'll get pregnant.

If they are on your wrist close to your hand you could wear wristbands, and get a couple of very thin long sleeved T-shirts to wear under your regular short sleeve shirts (assuming they are on your arms.)<br>  <br>  For special occasions, you can buy heavy duty foundation to keep your skin looking even, but make sure it is a paler shade for your arms.<br>  <br>  As for the answerers who will see this and freak out at me for giving 'advice', you should know that having people you don't want seeing your scars see them only makes things worse.<br>  <br>  For more advice and a great community to talk to, go to Psyke.org|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Depends on where they are located...the obvious is clothing...but when its warmer, you can try this makeup they sell on QVC its called prescriptives and it gives you full coverage without it looking...cakey...so I would recommend that...and it also contains spf 15 so the sun won't damage and make your scars more noticeable.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|cn04Dmzeaa	I understand that you probably cut for that release of internal pain that you may be feeling but there are better ways to let it out and it's about finding ways to cope.<br>  <br>  Please seek counseling and hopefully you can learn better ways to relieve your pain|`|FbJozo7Zaa	well from my personal experience, it all depends on where exactly it is. if its that noticeable, then i would normally put on foundation. just make sure its the right skin tone for you. =)  and make sure you clean the cutts FIRST|`|c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	Hello kitty bandaid.

You should cherish every second instead of poisoning yourself with that rubbish. Your making a very big generalization of the elderly, they do NOT sit around all day, my gran and grandad go dancing, out for dinner, to see their children and grandchildren and live a very full life. You just think about all those people that have died from things that are not their fault, all the people that died way before their time, their families grief and sadness of everyone who knew them. And you are there saying, oh I don't care when I die, as long as I can have another puff of disgusting, smelly and down-right horrible nicotine. Maybe you should have a look in the mirror, you sound like the worst person to know, those people telling you to stop so you can stay here longer and you go and laugh in their face. <br>  You ought to take your lips from around those hell-holes and start thinking of others. <br>  <br>  Don't waste your life on silly stereotypes and trying to look cool. <br>  You go have fun with your cigarettes, but you remember all those people that died for things that they didn't cause.|`|RW6Ja6eeaa	Okay, first off, learn how to spell.<br>  <br>  Also, learn how to use punctuation properly.<br>  <br>  Cigarettes are proven causes of throat and lung cancer.

54584be41adb64f9b6e8e05f340e3cabaa	Find a method exercise that you enjoy and do it every day. Build muscle. Eat WHATEVER you want when you are actually hungry and stop before you are stuffed full. If you forbid yourself to eat a food, you'll become obsessed with it.  When you cheat, you'll cheat hard and binge that forbidden food.  If you allow yourself to have everything, you'll get sick of that food.  Try to eat a balanced diet, but don't limit yourself with a bunch or rules and diets. Diets don't work and are unhealthy in the long run. Only do things that are healthy and that you can do forever, for the rest of your life, like cutting fast food forever.  95 percent of dieters gain it all back in one year and 99 percent do in two years.

It's the same system that has been documented and scientifically proven by weight loss experts all over the world.<br>  <br>       This incredible system has already had a major impact on the health and lives of countless people all over the world... people just like you.<br>  <br>       This is the only diet concept that results in MASSIVE weight loss... and it will work for you, even if you are only 75% committed to following my quick and easy weight loss plan.<br>  <br>  What am I talking about...<br>  <br>  "The Low Glycemic Index Diet --<br>  <br>  Better Known as The Low GI Diet"<br>  <br>  Finally, a diet program that WORKS!<br>  <br>       The LOW GI Diet focuses on foods that are 'slow-release' in your body. What this means is that when you eat any food, your body digests that food either, quickly, or slowly depending on the Glycemic index of that food.<br>  <br>  Why is this important...<br>  <br>        Well, quick 'release foods' are your bodies worst enemy as they are digested quickly by your stomach and your body is unable to burn off the calorie from that food... causing fat deposits to stick to you.<br>  <br>        So, our diet "must" consist mainly of 'slow release foods' which allow us to burn off the calories ingested.<br>  <br>        Slow release basically means that your body is getting energy from your food throughout the day and therefore your fat stores will be limited as the calories from your food will be burnt off throughout the day.<br>  <br>  At Last! .. A Simple Step-By-Step Method<br>  <br>  For Easily Loosing Maximum Weight In<br>  <br>  The Shortest Time Possible.. While Still<br>  <br>  Eating The Foods You Love...<br>  <br>  Unlike many diets you will still be able to enjoy the foods you love and enjoy.<br>  <br>       The key to the LOW GI Diet is... Moderation! ... and the best part is, you don’t need to starve yourself, do weird exercises every day or run hundreds of miles every month… and… certainly you don’t need to take any dangerous or unpredictable drugs for you to see these kinds of amazing results.<br>  <br>       The LOW GI Diet is simple... for a weight loss program to be successful it has to be EASY TO DO!.. It’s a basic truth that people just don’t do well on programs that are difficult to follow.<br>  <br>       But you don’t have to worry about that with the LOW GI Diet. This plan is so incredibly easy to follow even a kindergartner could do it (and actually it would be very beneficial for kindergartners’ health if they did follow this plan instead of eating all the junk food that today’s youth consume).<br>  <br>       Let me ask you a question: How much easier would your life be if you lost 5 to 25 Kilos, had tons more energy and felt healthier than you had in many years? And if you are overweight and feeling bad now, how much worse will it be in 5 or 10 years?<br>  <br>       I can tell you from experience that, without a doubt, you will either fix this situation now or your weight will continue to increase and your health will slowly spiral downward.<br>  <br>  Turn around your future now... allow me to introduce.<br>  <br>  "The Ultimate Low GI weight-loss Program”<br>  <br>  E-book -- The Easy, Healthy Way To<br>  <br>  Achieve Permanent Weight Loss.."<br>  <br>       At last!.. every ounce of information you need to succeed with the  LOW GI Diet is here.<br>  <br>  Over the last 30 years, research into food and blood glucose response has completely changed our carbohydrate classification system.<br>  <br>       It has been learned that it is impossible to predict the impact on blood glucose levels by certain foods, instead people are fed carbohydrate foods and the response measured.<br>  <br>       This response is known as the Glycemic Index (GI), it is a measure of how quickly carbohydrate foods are digested and absorbed, and ranks carbohydrate foods according to their impact on blood sugar (glucose) levels: as indicted by elevated blood glucose<br>  <br>       Foods with a high GI are absorbed quickly into the blood stream and cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels. While foods with a low GI are broken down more slowly over time and keep blood glucose levels more stable (Remember that low is slow!).<br>  <br>       Some carbohydrate foods will maintain your energy levels for hours, while some may cause your blood glucose to rise and fall. Different types of carbohydrate can also affect feelings of fullness in the stomach and this can influence hunger and your ability to control your body weight.<br>  <br>  Why is the GI important?<br>  <br>       When our blood glucose levels are stable we have plenty of readily available fuel for the brain and muscles. If our blood glucose levels drop too low (hypoglycemia) we feel tired, dizzy and generally unwell. If our blood glucose levels rise too quickly a rapid drop usually follows this.<br>  <br>       Include low glycemic index foods in meals and snacks to slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream. A low glycemic index snack a few hours before exercise will help maintain your energy levels for more effective training. After high intensity exercise (strength training) a high glycemic index snack should be consumed within 30 minutes. This will help to replace energy and start the recovery process.<br>  <br>       Low-GI foods take longer to digest and help delay hunger pangs that little bit more and thus promote weight loss. So please choose your carbs carefully as this will lower your insulin levels and burn more fat. The secret is to swap high GI foods with low GI foods.<br>  <br>  Simple steps to a low GI diet.<br>  <br>  Step No 1<br>  <br>       Start with a healthy, well balanced and varied diet based on a good nutrition program. The diet should be low in fats, moderate in carbohydrate and protein. The program should be high in fibre and contain a varied amount of foods to provide the required amount of vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  Step No 2<br>  <br>        Look at the type of carbohydrates that you consume during the day. Look at the carbs that you eat the most, as these will have the most dramatic impact on your diet.<br>  <br>       Try to change the carbs you eat the most with at least one low GI one. (Replace potato with sweet potato, use noodles instead of rice) By substituting half of your daily carbohydrate from high GI to low GI will result in an overall reduction in the GI of your diet.<br>  <br>       Reducing the GI in your diet reduces your insulin levels and increases the fat burning apparatus in your body. Try to reduce the high GI's in your diet by substituting them with low GI's.<br>  <br>       Regular consumption of low GI foods increases the feelings of fullness and satisfaction and so prevents weight gain. Try taking in six small meals a day of healthy low fat low GI foods to prevent overeating at meal times and control appetite.<br>  <br>       Remember, that it is also important to look at the calories in food too Rice and bread might be low in fat but when your body is burning the carbohydrates in these foods it doesn't burn as much fat. So if you are on a low fat diet, you wont loose as much weight if your calories are still high.<br>  <br>  Have a look at the table below for the different GI food ratings.<br>  <br>  Low GI(<50)<br>   Medium GI (50-70)<br>   (High GI (70>)<br>   <br>  Grapefruit (26)<br>  <br>  Baked Beans (15)<br>  <br>  Lentils (29)<br>  <br>  Peanuts (13)<br>  <br>  Soy Beans (15)<br>   Pineapple (66)<br>  <br>  Raisins (64)<br>  <br>  Sweet corn (59)<br>  <br>  Potato Chips (51)<br>  <br>  All bran (51)<br>   Cornflakes (80)<br>  <br>  W/M Bread (72)<br>  <br>  Brown Rice (80)<br>  <br>  Carrots (92)<br>  <br>  Baked Potato (98)<br>   <br>  <br>  Compare these two menus and try to adjust your diet accordingly.<br>  <br>  High GI Menu<br>  <br>  Breakfast: 40 Grams of cornflakes with milk. Two slices of whole meal toast with margarine and jam.<br>  <br>  Snack: Two sweet biscuits with a white coffee.<br>  <br>  Lunch: Ham and salad whole meal Roll with an apple.<br>  <br>  Snack: Four crackers with cottage cheese and chives<br>  <br>  Main Meal: Serving of Roast chicken with a large baked potato, peas. and Small piece of cake.<br>  <br>  Low GI Menu<br>  <br>  Breakfast: 40 Grams of bran with low fat milk.

Two scoops of low fat ice cream with half a cup of canned<br>  <br>   Chicken, beef, fish, eggs, nuts, and avocados contain very little or no carbohydrates. These foods if eaten by themselves will not have much effect on your glucose levels and are very low GI. Alcoholic beverages especially wine are also low GI so can be included in your diet but remember to count them in your daily caloric intake.<br>  <br>  Low GI foods are ideal for loosing weight due to the slow absorption from the stomach.

AA10661379	I typically run long-distance (7 miles or so), but even on my low-mileage runs (3-4) I get that same feeling. I can't typically eat after a run because it makes me sick. However when I do, I get the feeling of being full, I get bloated and feel like I've completely failed my exercise routine.<br>  <br>  You should NOT "extreme diet" tomorrow. Eating too little will slow down your metabolism, especially if you are active. The full feeling your getting is probably because you had simple sugars at the party. These cause you to feel bloated later on, make you retain water, then ultimately cause you to crash. Eating the lean meat was probably a good idea because the protein will keep you full.<br>  <br>  Again I have to stress don't starve tomorrow! Just run again, eat healthy. One day of sweets won't kill you... I have 7 days of sweets a week :)|`|AA10459294	it sounds like you're probably just a little bloated.  Stay away from salty foods for a while, drink a lot of water. An "extreme diet" is NEVER a good idea.<br>  <br>  And just so you're aware, bananas don't really offer much protein. 1 large banana only has about 1g of protein, and about 30g of carbohydrates. If its protein you want, try just a spoonful of peanut butter, or one of my favorite post-workout snacks - 1oz of Grape Nuts, 1 tbsp peanut butter, 1 tbsp honey. Mix that together, spread it on a slice of toasted whole grain bread, and put banana slices on top. It's a good combination (protein, carbs, whole grains, fiber, fruit) and it keeps me going for a good while after a workout

No creo que puedas hacer esto, solamentye lo hacen en los hospitales y por la preescripción de un médico directamente y la aplicación excliva por personal capacitado de una institución hospitalaria.<br>  Si es por via gastrica, que es diferente, la sonda esta directamente orientada hacia el estomago u duaodeno, para esto los medicos rewcomiendan hacer una nutrición balanceada, apoyandose en un nutriologo.<br>  <br>  Los alimentos deben de ir licuados con agua, se deben de incluir siempre los básicos necesarios, como son proteínas, vitaminas y minerales, esto es decir, si la primera ingesta es el desayuno, se le debe de dar frutas, leche, huevo, cereales, agua y si el Dr. lo preescribe se le aplica algun suplemento calorico alto, para que el paciente tenga el necesario balance calorico.<br>  <br>  Consulta con el medico y el nutriologo.<br>  <br>  En la Milicia, hace algunas decadas, descubrieron que lo que podia usarse como sustituto del suero era el agua de un coco, pues esta es una reconstitución electrolitica adecuada y esteril, que podía aplicarse por via endovenosa.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|dOyASmyAaa	en  www.kelloks.com
GTza6W4raa	For some people yes, other no. I have heard from some people who are really into it, saying it easily removes all their hair. Unfortunately it didn't work for me. The only way to tell if it will work for you is to try it. It depends on factors like your hair and skin. I followed the instructions exactly, the test patch seemed to go well, but when I applied the Nair (and not for longer than it said), it burnt off all the hair but also all the skin where it was applied. It was itchy, painful and red for a couple of weeks. I haven't used it since. I have sensitive skin that is sometimes dry, and quite a lot of hair. So try it, but be careful.

8f2ab21eabc5cb8aecd660e368aa224faa	There are tons of factors that cause missing a period.  I'll assume you're not pregnant because that's too obvious.  If you have gained or lost a lot of weight, that effects your period.  Or if you are under a lot of stress, you can also skip periods.  Thats what happened to me a while back... i got really stressed out from school/family that i missed 2 periods.   Ummm... other than that, you should see a doctor, a friend from my high school started skipping her period every once in a while and it turned out to be a problem with her ovaries, and i hope thats not the case here. Good luck.|`|5df6086b06ce893193ce1b48d4a747ecaa	It's hard to comment when you don't say your age...are you in your late 30's or 40's ? you may be entering into Peri Menopause....if your younger then that, really theres not much to say other then go to your Dr.<br>  <br>  if your just starting out on your periods, then this can be quite common the first few years.....but after that, you may have a problem.
qitXGd0qaa	Honestly, it isn't painful, but somewhat uncomfortable. But the discomfort is more pyschological than physical.<br>  <br>  As far as who needs to go and when they need to go... Once you're 18 or sexually active, whichever comes first, you need a pelvic exam. <br>  <br>  The only way to ever avoid having a pap test is to never want birth control, never get pregnant and refuse your doctors orders for life. Pap tests screen for a variety of diseases so eventhough it isn't fun, it is necessary.|`|8Initt1aaa	Its not that bad, just intrusive. I would recommend going to a female doctor when you do go.

That will help a little.|`|0218b4ade4866954d1c01300e85b9b5eaa	There is no guarantee that you will or won't go through withdrawl.  Every ones body is different.  If you do go through withdrawl, it should not be that bad of symptoms. You may be a little moody, have some aches, fatigue, but over all the symptoms should not be that bad.  If you do feel really awful and I am wrong.  You could ween yourself off, by taking smaller doses. i.e. Start off by taking 3/4 of a pill instead of a whole one, and cut down the dose every couple of days until you are not taking anything. That way when you do stop completely taking the meds, the withdrawl symptoms are not as bad. <br>  The best advice I can give is not to worry and anticipate if your going to feel symptoms. If you do, keep your mind busy, watch TV, read a book. <br>   Also,to answer this question: I don't feel as though I'm addicted. I don't care that I take my last dose tomorrow....Does that matter in the withdrawal process??<br>   That does matter in an addicts withdrawl process. If you were an addict you would care if that was your last dose and feel anxious of the symptoms that await. But you dont feel like that so that is not going to effect you.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Your daily dosage has been moderate - probably not enough to cause a physical dependence.   You should probably not have any serious withdrawal problems, and maybe no problems at all, but everyone is different.  Most likely, the worst you will experience are things like a dull headache, a bad mood, an upset stomach, and maybe a a feeling like you can't relax your muscles body for a day or two.    Withdrawal symptoms are generally not a medical concern from this drug even if they are severe.  Your mental attitude has little effect on truly physical effects of withdrawal.

ym8jbkogaa	Effects of keeping it in for more than 4 hours can lead to Toxic Shock Syndrome, a rare but fatal disease that are caused by bacteria growing on the tampon. The tampon is gonna rot if you keep it in too long, and the resulting bacteria, etc... will affect your body too. <br>  <br>  Symptoms may include dizziness, breaking out in hot sweats, feel like you have the flu, and can easily faint, and just feel weak in general. Although death isn't common, it CAN happen...and it has actually happened to a girl (it was on the news), couple years ago. So you can still wear tampons to bed, no one's stopping you...but take caution.|`|QJHE3z1raa	slight chance of TSS<br>  <br>  but i mean like 1 to 100,000|`|AA10766729	Nothing horrible is going to happen!

It keeps bacteria in your vagina for a prolonged period of time, so changing it every 4-6 hours is best.

That will not be a problem since his  own marrow would not be functioning  and the marrow you donate will be making  new blood .<br>  they usually check for  other  things called  HLA compatibility .

Chances are actually fairly slim that you would be a match to him, because that gets into dna testing.  Best chance at a match is a full blooded sibling at 1 in 4, and then a parent or child at 1 in 8.  After that, chances are slim for anyone else.<br>  <br>  You can still get tested but the testing is expensive.  The other thing you could do is sign up for the marrow registry.  If he is having a bone marrow transplant, the docs will be checking the registry, and if you are already on the registry, then you could be a possible donor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marrow.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.marrow.org</a>

Endurance training (distance running, etc.) is the highest level of aerobic training.  <br>  <br>  Endurance training primarily trains the cardiovascular system.<br>  <br>  Resistance training is any type of exercise which forces the muscles to contract against a significant RESISTING force.  The most popular type is weightlifting, but other types include pilates, power yoga, rock climbing, etc.  In addition to increasing the lean mass which burns extra calories 24 hours per day, it strengthens tendons, ligaments, and combats osteoporosis by increasing the bone mass density.<br>  <br>  There are exercises that are hybrids of resistance and aerobic exercise.

3sszFQd5aa	If you have been depressed for a year and a half, you most likely are suffering from a severe clinical depression that will not just "go away". I highly recommend you seek treatment for your depression. A doctor will most likely want to prescribe some form of antidepressant for you. You may only need to take them for a short period of time until the depression lifts. Follow the links below for more information and resources for support.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Yes, most depression lifts on its own within 2 months without any treatment.|`|WixVIsFtaa	no, it doesn't just randomly go away.<br>  do you have seasonal depression?<br>  cuz if so, you can go through therapy just through that time.<br>  and with depression there are times your going to be happy, and theres times your going to feel really shitty.<br>  its an up and down kind of thing.<br>  depression takes alot of work, and you have to be willing to put time into it.<br>  i would suggest going to a thereapist and talking with them.|`|6uQh4VSpaa	Depression often comes in episodes, as short as a month or two, or sometimes for many years.  And yes, these can spontaneously get better.<br>  <br>  About half of people who undergo an episode of depression, will never have another one (regardless of whether it got better on it's own, or was treated).  But for people who have had more than one episode, it's more likely to be a recurring problem.|`|rGci1ehoaa	you might have seasonal depression... i have it and people look at me and say well of course nobody is happy when its cloudy snowy or rainy...they are ignorant and stupid. I would see a doctor and explain your depression.. although it sucks to depend on medication to make you happy it is worth it.|`|G5Y725Tpaa	I think if you've been depressed for that long, and it hasn't lifted, you should talk to someone about it. Trust me, it really does help to just talk about it. It also depends on how old you are; if you're under 18 or so then it's just part of growing up.
XcjxRaaGaa	slowly get off of them. if that doesn't help, get help from a psychologist|`|AFqZEOlRaa	First off, if you're 20 and have your own income, you need to move out of your parent's house and live on your own.  <br>  <br>  Then you need to talk to a professional about this problem.  The details are kind of sketchy, but I'm getting a feeling either of avoidance behavior or anxiety-driven distraction, but it would take more work to figure it out.  See a physician first, and ask for some Wellbutrin to help you with the smoking, then get a referral to a psychologist for the rest of it.|`|2013c214482ed233f855c7df59a3b010aa	the sighns are all around u and they say: vote bush|`|0Xcv0zetaa	I was a smoker for 25 years and I had quit smoking for over six times ,but never really quit smoking before.Just after I read that quit smoking program, I realized how easy quitting smoking was.I am a non-smoker now!

I'm 39 and I guess I'm beginning to enjoy my crazy tendencies, just use them productively or talk to a doctor.

I lost the use of my arm for a year, I built a 40' walkway with concrete stepping stones, river rock and cross ties, I did it in 8 hours from start to finish.

It sounds like you are creating your own stress.  If you think you are an addict, then you need to get some help.  Before anything, help yourself.  Marijuana is probally not a good thing either.  Look within yourself.  Find yourself.  Then start from that point.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.  There are many support systems out there.  Remember, you are doing this for yourself.  If you are not happy with your life, you can change it.  Good Luck|`|xAOw7JOkaa	I order to break addictions you have to limit yourself first.<br>  <br>  Continue to do what you do, but limit yourself little by little first so it's not such a drastic change that could cause depression.

zmamUDlRaa	You could be suffering from insomnia. In any case, there a lots of things you can do to help you sleep. Try drinking an herbal tea before bedtime, for example. If you want more tips on falling asleep, check out <a href="http://www.realhomeremedies.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.realhomeremedies.com</a> and click on the insomnia link on the left. good luck!|`|1511ccf110397392bb484a3efa5c5defaa	Working out about 3 hours before going to sleep is supposed to help.  Try turning down the lights gradually before bed, and also no TV for at least 30 minutes before sleep.<br>  The brain produces melatonin as the nighttime queues begin (lights going down, calmer activities, but especially light), which helps you go to sleep.<br>  If you need a little push over the edge to sleep, melatonin supplements help some (my daughter, for example).  Try a small dose, like 1mg, about 30 minutes before bed.  Some people it affects faster, so be prepared.  For the first week it practically knocked my daughter out, but now it just helps her over that edge to fall asleep.  (It was recommended by her doctor.)  She ended up going to 3mg, but now is at 1.5mg successfully.<br>  Check with your doctor first if you have any health conditions or are on any medications, but as far as I know it can be taken with most medications.<br>  <br>  Other suggestions given are great, too.<br>  Sweet dreams.|`|HlaFQzWLaa	Here are some ideas on sleeping better-<br>  Do not watch the news before going to sleep.<br>  Try and go to sleep around the same time every night and wake up around the same time every morning.<br>  Do not take a nap.<br>  Do not do other things in your bed.  Like eat watch TV, or read so your mind knows when you are in your bed it is time for rest.<br>  When you lay down close your eyes and replay your day in your head, then when it is done you are mentally done with the day and go to sleep<br>  Do not drink alcohol before going to sleep,  alcohol makes you have a terrible night sleep.<br>  Do not take sleeping pills you will just become dependent on them.<br>  Good Night!<br>  Sleep Tight!<br>  and DO NOT let the bed bugs bite!!!|`|qFS242vTaa	I would keep a daily journal for about 10 days. It would consist of what you ate, any exercise, and any drugs you took. After about 10 days look it over and see if you can spot and trends like sleeplessness when a certain food is eaten or sleeplessness when not much exercise is done. In that case you would stop eating that food and you would get more exercise.  Eventually your body will fall back into place on it's own. I wouldn't worry to much about it, everyone has trouble sleeping once in a while.  And if you don't see any trends after 10 days, and the sleeplessness continues, you can always go see a doctor. There's plenty of good perscription sleep aids on the market. <br>  <br>  ****Contrary to popular belief, not all sleeping pills are habit forming.<br>  ****And just for the record, I sleep just great after a long night of beer pong.
Olo1oB8Laa	If you have the points calculator, it allows you to figure out the points. ther is also a book that lists the food and the points value.  <br>  1 serving Spaghetti: 4 pts<br>  1 serving beans:  1-2 pts<br>  1 large egg:  2 pts<br>  2 slices bread: 2-3 pts
OPZoJpSbaa	Betagen HP contains 2g of creatine and 2g of glutamine, and the bottle recommends 3 servings per day.  <br>  <br>  Most sources recommned 5g of creatine per day, so if you take 3 servings of Betagen HP, it should replace your having to take additional creatine.
AA10093245	I never did until I had my baby....... then these things just appeared, they look like love handles that slipped down too far. I was looking in the mirror after my baby was born, and I was like "how did my hips get these corners? I look square now!" Definitely can't wear hip huggers anymore.  The best exercise I found for them (kinda firms the muscle underneath, so they look better) is to lay on the floor on my side, bend the bottom leg, and keep the top leg straight, and raise it straight up as high as I can without bending the knee, and repeat 50 times on each side. Going really fast kinda defeats the purpose because you sort of just bounce, but slower controlled lifts and concentrate on tightening the butt and hip. A little hard to describe in words, without being able to show you.

If you eat right and exercise whatever size you are will be your healthy size.  Don't buy into what the media and what other people tell you.  <br>  <br>  Someone who 5'4 and 145 pounds, but eats well and exercises is way healthier then someone who is 5'4 weighs 120 and eats horrible food and doesn't exercise.|`|26d9ed3d6b3f38644ab1e9e5cf143e1aaa	BALANCE IS KEY!!!!  don't you ever believe all that crap they say about super skinny women being sexy that's BS for men , your mom is right , guys like a little meat on your bones!!! but you have to healthy and that's more important whether a guy likes you or not , so i will say that for your height a 120lbs wouldn't be that bad!!1|`|AA10529875	You don't say how old you are, and what frame type you are.  These are important to determine what is "too skinny" for your height.  Ask your doctor where you are on the height/weight percentiles.  Also, keep in mind that being called "fat" doesn't mean that you are fat.  Some people just like to be mean.  I think your mom might be on to something when she tells you men like women who look healthy, not skin and bones.|`|JkU0N4cLaa	It's my belief that everyone has their own standard of homeostasis. If you take care of your body your body will take care of itself. Wanting to lose weight only causes mental stress on yourself. You should learn how to love yourself for who you are. And don't ever let what someone else say deter or bring you down. "Keep walking, even through adversity."<br>  <br>  -----------------<br>  <br>  And your mom is right, I'm a guy and I like women with a little meat on their bones. Skeletons are not soft to hold.

bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	You may have ringing in your ears for a bit (even up to a couple of days) however, you should recover your hearing after some time, very loud sounds can cause temporary hearing loss, however, in most cases this resolves completely.  Prolonged exposure to loud sounds however, can cause permanant hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears)|`|rf3nJ0xxaa	Its possible the ringing will go away.

I haven't gotten any acne, my breast are still the same size, and I haven't gained any weight. I have noticed that I am more emotional though, like crying at stttttttttupid movies and such during the 3 weeks I take the pill, but that goes with the terittory I think.

They all have open hours as well as answering services for after hours.  It could be that the Prozac is not working for you as well as it should.  Some withdrawal is to be expected after such a long term of taking the medication, but nothing as extreme as you describe.  Those symptoms do not sound like major depression to me.  It sounds more like manic depressive disorder.  Do as I do, call the doctor over anything that gives you cause to worry over.  After all, that's what they make the mega bucks for.|`|GLntcug3aa	Akk, Effexor is horrible to come off in my experience. I kept passing out due to ridiculously low blood pressure so I went to see my doctor and he checked me out and told me to take it easy. It took my about 3 days to recover from that. The best thing I found was sleep and a dark room. It felt like a had a migraine so I treated it that way and the dark room helped a lot. I also found that listening to a talking book helped to center me a little after the three day hell where, as you described, I had the anxiety etc. It all lasted for about a month and a half - until my others kicked in I guess. I am now on Citalopram if you were wondering.

8cjFSBW9aa	I am curious if you were diabetic before you were overweight or overweight then became diabetic. It would just give me an indication of what type of diabetes you have. I am going to guess that you have Type 2 Diabetes, sometimes called Adult Onset Diabetes, most of the time because it can be brought on by being severely overweight and usually doesn't appear until people reach adulthood. It is usually treated by oral medications and a restricted diet. <br>  As we all know, diabetes, whatever type you have , is nothing to take for granted since it can lead to other life threatening conditions such as heart disease, blindness, arteiorsclerosis, <br>  respiratory disease, loss of limbs, infections from sores that do not heal, etc. So it is extremely important to keep your diabetes under control as best as you can. I wish it was as simple as cutting back on sugar and carbs and taking your medicine. If you haven't talked to your doctor about it already, PLEASE make an appointment with a nutritionist or dietician who can go over in detail,--- what we can't do here because it's not that simple,--- all of the foods that you can and can't have, how to do exchanges with your food so you can still enjoy food, and all of the other things, that with their expertise, can help you see that just because you have diabetes and are overweight, your life is not over.<br>  Next, increase your physical activity, something that all of us probably need to do. Start out easy. Take a walk after dinner or walk during your lunch so you can enjoy a break outside during your day. Drink  6-8 glasses of water a day and get rid of the sodas. If you have to drink a soda, diet and sugar free and one a day. Too many sodas are not good for your kidneys either, sugar free or not. Water will help make you feel full and flush out your system. After you start increasing your physical activity, if you can , join a gym or go the the Y , someplace where you can maybe get some guidance with your exercise and some diversity in what you do so you don't get bored. Also, find a friend to work out with you. You may meet someone at the gym who is looking for a workout buddy as well. Try using a swimming pool if there is one available because exercsing in water is fun and so much easier on your joints. Everyone is weightless in water. You don't have to swim laps---just walk in the water, maybe some water aerobics {much easier than regular aerobics, which I can barely stand} or just have some fun. Anything that will get the blood pumping and your heart rate up some. Of course, <br>  check with your doctor first to make sure that you are healthy enough for exercise.<br>  I guess what I want to say is that what you are dealing with is very serious and something that you need someone to talk to face to face to get the facts-- Your doctor, a dietician, and maybe someone to help you with an exercise program. The cool thing is, is that when you start taking control of your diabetes and you see the weight start to come off, you are going to start feeling better physically and mentally and the really cool thing is that when the weight comes off enough, you can reverse your diabetes!  It happens all of the time.<br>  I wish you the best and Good Luck!!|`|9hNS53pSaa	Ok it's not big problem.

Foods such as nuts, popcorn hulls, and sunflower, pumpkin, caraway, and sesame seeds should be avoided. People differ in the amounts and types of foods they can eat. Decisions about diet should be made based on what works best for each person. Scan food labels for bread and cereal products listing whole grain or whole wheat as the first ingredient. Look for cooked and ready to eat cereals with at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. Eat raw fruits and vegetables; they have more fiber than cooked or canned foods, or juice. Dried fruits (especially dried figs) are also good sources of fiber. Increase fiber in meat dishes by adding pinto beans, kidney beans, black-eyed peas, bran, or oatmeal. Try adding 2-3 tsp. of unprocessed wheat bran to foods such as meatloaf, casseroles, homemade breads, muffins and other baked goods. Dairy foods provide little fiber. Increase fiber by adding fresh fruit, whole grain or bran cereals to yogurt or cottage cheese.<br>  <br>  Hope this answer helps.<br>  Take care, <br>  Lee<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hoodithin.com/cmd.php?af=592511" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoodithin.com/cmd.php?af=5925...</a>|`|EIb0Wlqtaa	Whole wheat foods tend to be high in fiber.|`|8abec49c1ea367f1fcc8f56913503a66aa	<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-fiber-foods/NU00582" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-fi...</a><br>  <br>  hope this link gives u useful info.

5bJZcPbcaa	There are some creams or oils that are helpful for cold sores.  One of the best products for cold sores is L-Lysine though.  A natural amino acid that heals and prevents cold sores.  Another thing to take is a B Complex.  Many cold sores can be attributed to vitmain B difficiencies.  A B Complex is also beneficial for stress relief.  Some people are just prone to cold sores while others never get them.  I'd use the L-Lysine first because I've seen many people benefit from it.

The first is the cause of the disorder. If the gynecomastia is drug-induced, discontinuance of the agent may be all that is needed.<br>  <br>  If it is pubertal, watchful waiting is in order, since in most patients the condition will resolve spontaneously.<br>  <br>  Gynecomastia due to hyperthyroidism, acute hepatic disorders, or a recent onset of hypogonadism may remit in response to therapy for the underlying disorder.<br>  <br>  The second consideration is whether the gynecomastia is an incidental finding, detected only by the physician, or is brought to the attention of the physician by the patient himself. Mild asymptomatic gynecomastia detected only through physical examination requires no therapy other than treatment of the underlying cause.<br>  <br>  A third factor to consider is the length of time the gynecomastia has been present. A number of histologic studies have shown that gynecomastia present for less than six months usually demonstrates an active, or florid, histologic picture, characterized by marked ductal epithelial hyperplasia, proliferation of the periductal mesenchymal tissue, and periductal edema.<br>  <br>  In general, the indications for treatment include: marked pain and tenderness, severe embarrassment or emotional disturbance. The most uniformly effective therapy at any stage is surgical removal of the glandular tissue through a periareolar incision. In patients with a large amount of adipose tissue in the subglandular area, suction-assisted lipectomy may be performed at the time of surgery to improve the cosmetic results.

kMKJDAB6aa	From personal experience I love the IUD. For insertion its not that painful just like regular menstrual cramp and minor cramps after insertion. Cramps for 2-3 days after then after that everything was ok. My boyfriend felt it he told me at first but he shouldn't after a while that is when its settled properly..if he feels it after u have it in for certain period of time that means its out of place. Sexual intercourse does not hurt. Next thing u don't have to worry abt it all u need to do is chk every month after ur period that is in place. I personally love it and don't have a prob with it. My daughter is 2 and I am not planning on having any more kids any time soon so i think its a good choice. Hope it helps. N.B. In regards to menses, depends on which one u use the copper T may give u more cramps but its bearable..lol|`|SD5fWnRraa	Well my mother is a nurse and she says its the best thing out there for birth control now days.

g6bBORHxaa	It should definately go away. Sometimes people get anxious or paranoid for no reason at all. The more you think about being anxious the more anxious it makes you. Just do something fun to distract you or talk to someone. For me anxiety leaves pretty quickly. If it doesn't then it should probably go away eventually. It may be the person your with too or where/what you do when your high. Try changing those things up and your anxiety will likely change. I had a similar situation where I didn't like how I felt when I was high for a while. But eventually I got comfortable with how I am when I'm high and knew what to expect. Since then its all chill and all fun :]|`|na8ObA5Haa	I have no idea but i am the same way! i use to smoke alll the time. now i hate it because i started having bad expierences!<br>  <br>  <br>  it sucks!|`|tFcsLR7Maa	Sometimes it'll go away sometimes it wont. <br>  <br>  Same thing happens to me sometimes.

Sativas are head high makes me feel spaced out LOL.|`|r1Vg6djRaa	that happens sometimes when you smoke too much or smoke really good weed..lol<br>  yeah it shoud go away just try to know when u should stop smoking so you dont get that high again.<br>  but just in case it happens again, just tell yourself to chill, let yourself know its just temporary, and lay down with reallty nice music and focus on that. it feels soo good.lol<br>  trust me all you need to do is understand that your just parinoid and tell yourself to relax. haha|`|SmWoRu3kaa	Um... stop taking drugs?|`|MCWAWePJaa	perhaps it's God's way of saying not to do this...bad things can result from it...use your head kid!
geih5vR8aa	Well, at 108 lbs you don't need to worry too much about what you eat. Stay away from too much carbs and sugar... and try not to over eat.<br>  <br>  The best ways to tone up is doing circuit training. Check out a couple fitness magazines at the store and see if you can get some workout suggestions from there... or ask a personal trainer.<br>  <br>  Too much cardio is just going to make you thinner and thinner, and won't help you tone up as much as weight training. <br>  <br>  A good rule of thumb, is that cardio helps you lose weight. Weight training and circuit training helps you tone up and keep off the weight.|`|4XVqIalFaa	yeah you should always keep exercising and eating healthy. to tone you should do some workouts with weights.|`|1eUSlj11aa	try doing smaller meals more often and go for a routine like pilates or yoga! those are great in toning and giving flexiblity! it is also relaxing and gives a stress free workout which can sometimes affect your energy lvls!!

The unipolar in the diagnosis is meant to differentiate between a bipolar depressive episode.<br>  <br>  In unipolar depression, people experience severe depression and only depression.

AA10661379	You cannot target fat specifically. No matter how many sit-ups you do, you won't lose fat in your stomach. The best thing you can do is to run! Cardio exercises burn fat, but NOTHING you do will specifically target fat in one area (i.e. stomach, butt, thighs, etc.). "Target exercises" build muscle only. Therefore you can have an incredible six-pack under your belly but the abdominal workouts won't do anything for the fat.<br>  <br>  Running is really the best exercise there is. Cardio equipment such as the elliptical machine and arc trainer target thighs, so you build thigh muscle and essentially just make them larger without burning fat. Running is cheap too, just a good pair of shoes, comfortable shorts and shirt, and you're ready to go!

AA10065077	First, if you are sick you should stay at home. Try taking your antibiotic with food or milk. That might help calm the nausea. Try contacting the teachers of your classes and inform them what's going on. If leaving class to use the bathroom is the only reason you have to miss class then go to class. However, people with bladder infections normally have problems focusing so taking a test probobly isn't a good idea. I hope you feel better.|`|09602de241bc6378eda0ffa6cfdd1a97aa	in my opinion you should stay home and get better...after all if ur having trouble focusing, tests might not be the best thing for you.

K0IqnQtaaa	If you consume a lot of caffeine daily, and just recently stopped or cut back the amount of it, you could get really annoying headaches for a day or more at a time.

ca5c9699c67cb5a157dbea931998b50daa	Try the following;<br>  <br>  *Try reading a book.<br>  *Turn off any tv's or radios you have on (the background noise can distract you and prevent you from getting a deep sleep)<br>  *Limit the amount of unnatural light you have in your bedroom<br>  *Avoid eating after 9pm as your body has to work off the food you ate<br>  *If all else fails, try taking Melatonin ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin)</a> It's a natually occuring chemical in your body that helps regulate your wake/sleep cycle (try to avoid over the counter sleep medications as taking those comes with the added risk of addiction/overdose)<br>  *If this is a regularly occuring thing, talk to your doctor as this can be the signs of a sleeping disorder.|`|xJCARQZWaa	I find if I take a nice long bath just before going to bed I sleep a lot better.

cDkp3C0Gaa	I have it, too.  It's also known as Meniere's Syndrome, for those who prefer to not call it a disease.  My symptoms did not cause nausea, but I'd often have to reach out and touch something to maintain my "position" in the real world and head movements had to be slow and careful.<br>  <br>  It is caused by excessive pressure in the "balance tubes" of the inner ear.  There are cells that make the fluid, and cells that reabsorb it.  The latter quit working, causing more fluid to build up.  That disturbs the balance.<br>  <br>  There is no cure.  Treatment is typically diuretics and diet change to low/no salt to lower the overall fluid level of the body.  I don't like the diuretics because they also lower blood pressure, which I don't have a problem with.  The low/no salt diet is great.  First switch to no salt butter.  It's fantastic.  Much sweeter than salted.  Stay away from canned and processed foods.  Eat more fresh veggies.  If you must buy canned, get low or no sodium.  Taste is actually better.  I've included a link to a website dedicated to this.<br>  <br>  My doctor put me on a 1200 mg/day limit which I found was really easy to maintain, once I altered my thinking and habits about food and eating.  I had been running well over 3000 mg/ day which is not unusual for most people today.  I did overdo it, though.  Held it below 500 for about 3 weeks and ended up with extreme muscle cramps and spasms.  A high sodium meal stopped that problem right away.<br>  <br>  Ham/pork is extremely salty.  If he eats ham or pork, stopping that will cut his sodium intake a lot.  All lunch meats and processed meats are also very high in sodium.  <br>  <br>  I've done the diuretics and the diet.  What had the greatest effect was an acutuning my partner gave me.  I've included a link to her site, also.  During the first one, near the end, the dizziness stopped suddenly, like a switch was flipped.  That evening I did head movements while grocery shopping and cooking dinner that the day before would have sent me into the walls.  The dizziness slowly returned a few days later, but it has never come back to the degree it was before the first tuning.  Since then (November, 2006) I've had several more tunings that have all reduced it slightly.  I no longer watch my diet, although I still eat much healthier than before; still on fresh and minimally processed foods.  My symptoms are weak and brief, when severe enough to notice them at all.  I used to have a constant feeling of moving forward and right that is now gone, too.  Of everything I did, the acutunings had the most profound effect and the diet maintains it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  If you have any questions, contact me at shevie3@cox.net.|`|AA10649627	* Avoid alcohol, caffeine, excessive fatigue, smoking, and stress<br>  * Eat properly<br>  * Get plenty of sleep<br>  * Remain physically active<br>  if his vertigo is not containable, there are various surgeries he can choose from.|`|AA11441614	lot of resting. sorry for him.|`|e107003e85ea8172c3ec85204392614aaa	I have it too. I saw an ent doctor last week who said to cut way back on salt and caffeine.  He prescribed a short term perscriptoin of prednisone to knock the swelling down to minimize permanent hearing loss.  I was already on a diuretic for high blood pressure so I'm still taking that.   He also put me on an over the counter supplement called lipo-flavonoid which is supposed to increase inner-ear circulation..  So far this has greatly reduced the vertigo, but I still have ringing and pressure.  Good luck to your friend.  There are a lot of people out there who have this.

077713ee95aa711e6d344800dfbfe5acaa	Cara Stella P, como os colegas já falaram antes de mim, procure seu ginecologista... Uma palavra de cuidado: se encontrar um nódulo ou outra mudan?a no seu seio, n?o tente diagnosticar o caso sozinha. N?o há substituto para uma avalia??o médica.<br>  <br>  Abaixo posto alguma informa??es sobre verrugas, n?o para assustar, mas para esclarecer que n?o é uma coisa banal...<br>  <br>  A Verruga é um tumor benigno da pele causado pela infecc??o de determinadas estirpes dos oncogénicos Papillomavirus. O Condiloma acuminado é a mesma infec??o e tumor mas ocorre na mucosa genital ou oral.<br>  <br>  As verrugas s?o de causa infecciosa, transmitindo-se por contato com o vírus causador, contato este que pode variar desde um apertar as m?os até uma rela??o sexual ou a co?adura de uma les?o estabelecida que propicia a auto-inocula??o, também é possível a transmiss?o através de objetos.<br>  <br>  Como evolui?<br>  <br>  Mínimas les?es da pele permitem o vírus penetrar nas células, obrigando-as a produzir uma proteína que interfere nas fun??es reguladoras da reprodu??o celular, com isto a reprodu??o celular se dá de forma anormalmente acelerada. A supress?o desta regula??o é temporária o que explica a permanência autolimitada das verrugas e seu desaparecimento após certo tempo.<br>  <br>  O que se sente?<br>  <br>  As verrugas s?o nódulos (prolifera??o celular) endurecidos, benignos, de cor acinzentada, que de forma geral n?o causam sintomas. Em determinadas situa??es (devido à localiza??o) pode haver dor ou sangramento.<br>  <br>  Como se faz o diagnóstico?<br>  <br>  Em princípio o exame clínico é suficiente levando-se em conta os aspecto e a localiza??o da les?o.<br>  <br>  Como se previne?<br>  <br>  Previne-se evitando o contato com o vírus. A preven??o é de difícil execu??o, sendo raro o adulto que já n?o tenha apresentado algum tipo de verruga. <br>  <br>  Mais informa??es:<br>  <a href="http://www.abcdasaude.com.br/artigo.php?453" rel="nofollow">http://www.abcdasaude.com.br/artigo.php?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.podologiabr.com/detalhes.asp?cod=55" rel="nofollow">http://www.podologiabr.com/detalhes.asp?...</a><br>  <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verruga" rel="nofollow">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verruga</a><br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado :)<br>  <br>  P.S: Caso n?o tenha sido solucionada sua dúvida, me mande um e-mail (clicando no meu Avatar), com o maior número possível de informa??es.

77e9b8b08301c6912043fd43f7c663e8aa	Parece-me que você n?o gosta de rotina, falo isso porque me sinto da mesma forma que você. N?o presto aten??o a números, nunca sei onde pus a bolsa, a chave do carro, ent?o é uma odisséia para encontrar. Rezo até mesmo pro Padroeiro dos Desmemoriados. Percebo que quando estabele?o uma certa organiza??o de documentos, roupas, bijoux, óculos, etc, minha vida fica mais simples. Comprei umas caixas decorativas, grandes e muito bonitas, nelas organizei tudo que dizia respeito a cabelo: tinta, cremes, pentes, secador e outros; numa outra coloquei os óculos, pois tenho vários de sol e dois com grau; numa menor pus toda a maquiagem e na maior delas, advinhe!, soutiens. Coloquei todas numas prateleiras de vidro que ficam no meu banheiro. Se tiro algo de lá, coloco novamente, sen?o come?a tudo de nova...Com as roupas, separei as de frio e as do ver?o. As que est?o sem uso porque engordei, deixei-as num armário separado. As de uso constante coloquei nos cabides e um pouco numa c?moda: blusinhas do dia-a-dia, vestidos em malha, blusinhas mais arrumadas, etc. O que uso no inverno coloquei em sacos plásticos. Os sapatos dispus todos arrumadinhos, um ao lado do outro. Os que pouco utilizo nos lugares mais altos - para evitar bagun?a - e as bolsas. Fiz o mesmo com meus bregue?os de artesanato, costura, bijouteria - adoro artes manuais. DVD's guardei-os no móvel do home-cinema e os cds que quase nunca usamos est?o no maleiro. Olha, dá um trabalho manter tudo no lugar, mas a gente ganha tempo e poupa o estresse. Eu só nunca perdi as calcinhas em que estou vestida, mas o resto... Até um pouco de jóias que tinha queimei sem querer quando joguei fora papéis confidenciais, extratos de conta, etc.|`|BtF4XvJgaa	N?o é t?o simples como dizem: "falta de apego a rotina" ou "tem que ter for?a de vontade".

1o8FiHeraa	I just had my first root canal done back in March.  Um, I hope you didn't pay this woman because it is never okay to leave any sort of surgical or dental tool in a patient's body. When she drilled into the canal she should have packed it with medicine before sealing it up.  They do this in steps so if this was some so called One Step or One Time root canal, that is wrong.  They go in and drill a bit, get the infection out, pack it with medicine, and they seal it up for two weeks.  Then you go back, they take all that stuff out and redo it.  I went back a third time, they took the medicine out, put whatever it is they put in there (which should not hurt by the last time because the root and nerve ending are gone), then they seal it with the crown.  Some pain after is a little bit normal because they are drilling around but he shouldn't be in excrutiating pain when all is said and done.<br>  <br>  You need to get him to another dentist ASAP.  Then you need to contact your insurance company to stop payments because this woman, in my opinion, did not do her job.  And if the next dentist you take him to says that what she did was incorrect, you need to report her to the ADA and get in writing all of the things that have gone wrong.|`|3YNE5vN0aa	You aren't supposed to work on an infected tooth.

Because the root canals are so narrow, part of the file used to clear the root breaks off, these files are tiny and best left alone as they shouldnt cause problems as long as the tooth is healing.  I have part of a file in mine.  <br>  Infection can take some time to clear, she should have precribed a course of anti biotics.  Some residual discomfort is normal until the tooth settles but if this carries on beyond a week then you need to go back.|`|POFdWpUzaa	Wow, the drill broke off and she sealed it? The pain he has should be minimal and usu sally from the shots. I've had lots of root canals. Call another dentist and get him in right away and get that drill out of there.

iuduvrEiaa	If people with certain energetic fields start working with them (ie. via chi gung), sometimes they can cause electronic fields to malfunction.  I know one specific chi gung master who always has his computers fail, and other electronic gadgets.<br>  I've also personally seen some awfully unusual things happen with street lights going out.<br>  Normally though, what I just described does not happen, and the people who perceive it's happening are just having an observation bias (ie. ___ has a 1% chance of happening, they selectively notice/focus on/have more memory focused on the 1% so that it seems to be well over a 1% occurrence).  I have never heard of anyone who has problems to the same extent as what you're describing (and my open mind is somewhat skeptical none of them were chance).<br>  <br>  That said, it's possible you have some "bad stuff/issues" inside you, and the way you've gone about doing mediation created problems from that (there are plenty of unusual, and in my opinion bad methods of meditation which can cause problems such as messing the practicioner up).  Most of my knowledge base comes from "good" methods of meditation, so I might just not have a wide enough array of experience for whatever technique you are doing and what's it's causing.<br>  If you want to tell me what method you're practicing specifically, I could give you some commentary on that, and if you're in the mood to try something else which is less likely to cause problems I can recommend you to that as well.<br>  <br>  However, I seriously seriously doubt that meditation is actually causing what you're describing; it just does not fit with what I've seen.  Meditation is wonderful for you though, so it would be a loss to give it up, and it's definitely a good investment to learn even better approaches.<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|aEROlgL7aa	Sounds very strange indeed. Perhaps by meditating you are somehow draining the energy force from these appliances. We are all just a bunch of energy forces anyway and energy is neither lost nor destroyed according to the great Einstein. Or perhaps it's all just coincidence? Nothing cease to amaze me these days but anything is possible.|`|j25i1oOHaa	Maybe you're not doing it right.Don't try doing it again.
LKaFpQ8raa	I don't know about sun poisoning, but you do need rest and aloe vera LOTS of ALOE VERA. I suggest it might be heat exhaustion or dehydration.

0sP8ECVRaa	just try to avoid them altogether ,best to miss a cigarette than miss a hospital appointment. why take the RISK|`|QLopvWKDaa	Actually, unless you have some underlying health condition, it probably is not going to hurt you.  Many doctors will even admit that under 5 a day is medically considered a "non-smoker".<br>  <br>  However, nicotine addiction is one of the most insidious, sneaky, overtaking addictions there is.  Thinking that you can remain at one or two a day or "only when I drink" will eventually render you addicted- I call it "Dancing with the Devil".  <br>  <br>  Playing with nicotine can seem very harmless and enjoyable, until you are well into the addiction trap! The best advise- Don't even start- ask any smoker- They'll tell you!|`|JvUzyLwcaa	No but there is a problem. Cigarettes are addictive so soon you will not be able to only have one every few days and you will become addicted!!|`|mY7hPmSmaa	One cigarette every two or three days is worse than none. But it's a hell of a lot better than 20 a day. <br>  <br>  The amount you smoke at the moment is very small and I wouldn't have thought it'd be likely to cause a great deal of damage on it's own. However, I'd be most concerned that you could increase it and develop an addiction which could genuinely start to cause health problems. |`|MDTfdxVoaa	Umm lets see.  You can get cancer in your lungs, smell bad, yellow teeth and you become dependent on one of the most harmful  drugs ever known to man.  Why don't you be the judge.|`|tDGDrmUKaa	One cigarette is bad for your health.<br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like that much of a habit, but I'd kick it.<br>  <br>  If you do it to relax, find other means.
nMk3KGA9aa	Alimentos ricos em ferro ; peixe, frutos do mar, leguminosas, carne de carneiro, frutas cítricas e legumes ricos em vitamina C , etc.........<br>  <br>  Ferro<br>  <br>  Ferro é um componente fundamental da hemoglobina e de algumas enzimas do sistema respiratório. A deficiência deste mineral resulta em anemia.<br>  <br>  Importante saber  que sem a vitamina C, a quantidade de ferro obtida pela ingest?o de vegetais é irrisória. O feij?o, por exemplo, é rico em ferro. Porém, nosso organismo só consegue absorver apenas cerca de 10% desse mineral contido no cereal. No entanto, se o feij?o for acompanhado de um alimento rico em vitamina C como suco de laranja a absor??o pode chegar a 40%.<br>  <br>  As carnes s?o diferentes, pois est?o entre as melhores fontes de ferro e, nesse caso, as moléculas do mineral n?o precisam da ajuda da vitamina. As melhores fontes de ferro s?o a carne bovina, porco e frango<br>  A deficiência de ferro é comum, principalmente em mulheres pela perda durante pela menstrua??o. Liz Applegate da Runnersworld.com também lembra que corredores devem estar atentos para a ingest?o de ferro, uma vez que, além de perderam este mineral pela urina e transpira??o, a própria corrida pode atrapalhar a habilidade de absor??o de ferro*.<br>  <br>  Principais fontes: Carnes, porco, frango, peixe, ovos, legumes.|`|8056492e74ad4235b2d4c4a088740f24aa	soja, fígado de boi, beterraba.|`|fbd8a3447e1183f5549de66063e39e48aa	banana, cenoura, o leite comum e o leite de soja.|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	olha vc cozinhe com panela de ferro ou bote um peda?o de ferro dentro das panelas na hora de gazer comida.|`|ec7f10b9c18e24dbca4ef0cfd402609daa	Olá.! <br>  <br>  Alimentos que contêm ferro: vegetais verdes e folhas; carne vermelha (magra); bife de fígado; aves, peixe, ostra; germe de trigo; frutas secas e cereais com adi??o de ferro. <br>  <br>  Aconselho a fazer uma pesquisa no Google, vc vai encontrar resposta prá sua pergunta. <br>  Resposta mais detalhada, ok? <br>   bjs.|`|mEnMbK2vaa	Soja, ervilha, g?o de bico, goiaga, beterraba,figado.....|`|4cd015a6d5c8648ecfe214b986b0adc0aa	PREGO, PARAFUSO, ARRUELA, ROSCA, ALICATE, CHAVE DE FENDA, LIMA, GROSA.|`|5ec95ef4140a892a3ef05a24ba29b6a2aa	Procure uma orienta??o alimentar com um profissional da área um nutricionista.

kD7TMG1Xaa	your light olive skin should work as an advantage to you as you are less likely to burn. they say to be protected in england you need factor 15 on an ordinary day greece is quite a lot hotter and so factor 30 would be advisable i would definatly thikn of using that on most risk spots sch as your face ears and the back of your neck, you will still tan with 30 it will just take a bit longer but you definatly wont burn. you could use factor 30 for the first few days and maybe slowly drop down as you tan more but dont drop too much as even a tan is a lot of skin damage just be sensible and dont say in the direct sun too long, tanning at times like earlier morning and at about 4 is much safer|`|b1e3e7a6ddb682542ad17efc49a6dcacaa	It depends the climate and exposure of the sun etc....spf 30 is ok for reasonable protection...and if you are planning for hangout more than an hour then after an hour reaply it  and if you are planning for swimming then better buy a water proof one....and dont forget to buy a well known brand...and they  recomend us to use even in winter season....hope this is enough to clear your doubts.

DGAk3J2Zaa	~ hi ~ I'm very sorry about the pain you're experiencing. Neck pain is horrible and it sounds like you're really having a challenging time with it.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're doing a lot of the right things. Definitely continue alternating the ice and heat 15 minutes each. The ice will definitely help reduce the inflammation and the heat will help relax your muscles.<br>  <br>  Is there someone you can trust that can give you a nice neck massage? I have found that is one thing that helps me the most. Definitely ensure the person is gentle and have them really work the area of the neck that feels the most stressed and stiff. I know it helps me immensely when my neck is out of whack and my husband is always amazed how much tension I carry in my neck when I can barely move - sometimes he is even able to locate knots. Just make sure the person uses a gentle approach.<br>  <br>  You may have it a worthwhile investment to pay for a neck massage - a skilled massage therapist can do wonders and the price for 30 minute massage is much more reasonable than you'd think.<br>  <br>  If you can tolerate Ibuprofen, I would definitely which to Liquid Ibuprofen. Since it's an anti-inflammatory it will target the inflammation that is occurring in your neck and I have found that liquid Ibuprofen works quickly and is amazingly beneficial.<br>  <br>  I would also really make sure you're using a firm and supportive pillow at night. This will help avoid this problem in the future and help now. So, if you don't have one, see if someone will get one for you. <br>  <br>  Here's some more information on neck pain:<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neck-pain/DS00542" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neck-pa...</a><br>  <br>  I really hope you get relief soon. You're in my thoughts.|`|AA10065077	Keep doing the ice/heat try some Alieve or ibuprofen. Like others have said give it time. Also you could try having someone message your neck. I hope you feel better.|`|AA10382021	best thing is time, and try sleeping in a more relaxed position on your back and not on your side, if it keeps persisting after a another day or so head to a doctor or chiropractor|`|L4PxEoIAaa	Yeah I say see a chiropractor..its proven to work for me!

UyJb9Aufaa	I take Yaz also and it takes 7 days for the pills to become effective.  You can wait longer if you want but according to the directions and my dr, you only have to wait a week.  Yaz has cleared up my acne and has made my nails grow stronger.  It didn't change my hair growth.  OTC vitamins won't interfere but anti-seizure medications, antibiotics, and some herbal supplements (like St. John's Wort) WILL.  Keep in mind also that being sick (vomiting or diarrhea) right after taking the pill can also interfere with absorption thus making the pill less effective.  When in doubt use a backup method.|`|QSc2dTJ8aa	Your birth control pill will be effective after 4 wks. I do not know about vitamins interfere with them but antibiotics do.|`|aic8vilHaa	Should be effective after youve completed a full cycle of pills.As for Yaz and vitamins i dont think it would effect it but its best to check with your doctor.|`|sTHnXgVEaa	I don't know very much about Yaz, but for my bc the package says it takes a week, my doc told me to wait a month for it to work to be on the safe side.

fk9AvB25aa	Well there is always a very small chance that your partner could get herpes as well.<br>  If the person who has herpes is on suppressive therapy then that would make it less likely for them to pass herpes onto their partner. It can also prevent out breaks from happening. They should continue with this treatment regularly in order to protect their partner from getting herpes. <br>  The person with herpes should also never have sex if they have any signs of an out break. Herpes is more contagious while there are signs of an out break then when there isn't one. The rest of the time there is still a 2-5 percent risk of passing herpes on. <br>  You should know that herpes takes skin to skin or genital to genital contact to pass on. Condoms don't do much to protect against herpes since they don't cover all of the areas that herpes can occur on. If they had some thing going on out side of where the condom protects then there is still a small chance that you could get herpes.<br>  40 percent of North America has the genital type of herpes so that's like saying one in every ffour people you sleep with could have genital herpes and most people who have it don't know that they have herpes. Either because they have never been tested for herpes or because their symptoms are so mild that they can mistake it for some thing else.<br>  Women with herpes can still have children and even healthy babies. They should be on some kind of suppressive therapy during their pregnancy. If there are any signs of an out break at delivery then the doctor should preform a c-section which would help prevent the child from getting herpes which can be deadly to new borns (it can cause blindness, brain damage and even death).<br>  People with herpes can still lead healthy relativly normal lives but they do get rejected some times when it comes to dating because there is a big negative stigma out there against hepres. Basically it means that any one who has herpes has been doing some thing dirty, promiscuous or gross to get them when that is not always the case.<br>  I contracted both oral and genital herpes from my boy friend. He didn't know that he had herpes and I didn't know any better what cold sores were. We never cheated on each other and have been committed, monogomus and living together for 3 years.|`|7025a6c6a18e110fc5a6cbaa84055a0baa	there are drungs on the market to help the outbreaks. You can catch it even though the other person is not haveing a breakout.Theres no cure, and if you are not protected you will get it.|`|UdgSbplXaa	Firstly, there are ways to have children without having sex. Generally, people don't like that option, though, despite it being the safest option in your scenario.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, there are no absolutes with any infectious disease. Repeat, no absolutes. An individual can have unprotected sex with someone who has herpes and come away uninfected. But it's like Russian roulette, if you know what I mean. There are certain medications that can reduce the risk of transmission by preventing outbreaks of herpes. Again, this is not 100% effective.<br>  <br>  Also, the gender of the infected individual plays a role. If the female is infected, the male is less likely to contract the infection than if the roles were reversed.<br>  <br>  The short answer: Yes, if one person is infected and they have a spouse and they want to have kids, the infection will likely spread to the spouse and probably the kids as well.|`|4PPYl4lSaa	I don't know the chances exactly, but I would imagine they are high. You might want to consider in-vitro or artificial insemination. Also, if the mother is the one with Herpes you might have to consider cesarean section for delivery as Herpes is detrimental to the newborn.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well and talk to your gynecologist on your next visit.|`|9013566cbccffa8beabbd46f4464a172aa	No it does not, I know someone who has Herpes.The other person has not contracted it and they even have children now.

DGAk3J2Zaa	~ hi ~ ! Tetanus shots really aren't any more painful than any other shots. I know my kids have to get them every 5 years and even though they absolutely hate shots, they generally don't have any issues with them. Just try to look away and focus on something other than the the shot and while you feel the initial stick, the pain will go away very quickly.

They will check your iron levels before you donate. <br>  <br>  With regards to feeling dizzy; You must have eaten within a few hours before attending the blood donor session, so that you don’t get faint or dizzy during the session.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	yes you can safely donate blood while on your period, as you lose so little blood when on your period x|`|Tledw3eAaa	I doubt it could kill you if you did, but if I were you I would wait if possible until your period was over. Just having your blood taken can make some people dizzy or a little weak, and I imagine that might be intensified by the blood loss of your period. <br>  <br>  So unless you are donating blood in order to help out someone you know, like a friend or family member, I would say just wait until your period is over with.<br>  <br>  Or better yet... ask the person taking your blood. They would be the best people to ask whether or not you should wait.|`|f4doqdSCaa	The only concern would probably be if you tend to have problems with anemia. You really don't lose very much blood through menstruation, generally. So, if you're in good health, I see no reason why not.|`|BKHpjPAcaa	Make sure you take your iron. <br>  <br>  If you go to your local donation clinic, sure they would advise.

I would go check that first.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	They won't tell you that you cannot, however, they will do an iron test before letting you donate anyway. If your iron is low, they won't allow you to donate. You may be at a higher risk for low iron, but since they let you know anyway, it shouldn't be a big deal.<br>  <br>  If I were you and I felt really run-down during my period, I would just hold off. Giving blood can make you feel run down although it's a great thing to do.|`|6iCOMx8laa	Yes, they check your iron levels,if you are anemic they will refuse to let you donate.  I don't think I've ever been turned away while on my period.

One  has nothing to do with the other.|`|uTKCjmKgaa	i have asked a nurse this before, when i was about to donate, and it is fine if you have a fairly high level of iron in your blood, (which thankfully i did) that's really the only reason you wouldn't be able to donate is if your period lowers your iron level too much, then the blood isnt viable for other people and you have to wait 4 months before you can even go for a test again (in the UK at least).<br>  <br>  anyone who tells you you'll be bleeding too much already or whatever is talking rubbish you only lose about a tablespoon of blood during menstruation, which is nothing in terms of the total amount of blood there is in your body<br>  <br>  so if you are prone to low iron levels or anemia it may be best to wait, but if not, then go for it. go save a life :)|`|8Xs8ny9paa	 No, not while you're menstruating. You lose a lot of blood during that time, and you need to keep what you have left. Although once you're finished, or almmost finished, you can defifntly go, just not while it's heavy. If you're also feeling weak or tired, reenergize before donating unless it's an emergency; you get get sick, or lose consciousness for a while. |`|LGLN3IQFaa	I should think it would be fine. See, menstrual blood is gathering in your uterus during the entire month, and so it's not being taken from your system all at once.

Diseases and illnesses can in some cases prevent you from reaching your height maximum, but nothing will help you exceed your potential. <br>  <br>  You should eat a healthy balanced diet and take regular exercise to ensure you reach your maximum potential, but there is nothing you can do to make yourself grow taller. No specific foods you eat will help you. There is no way for any of us to know how tall you will be and what your height potential is. Your height is not defined by what you eat. Sorry.|`|wzpCMI44aa	That is odd. I'm pretty short: 4'6" at age 21. I'm perfectly proportioned, shortness just runs in the family. I recall that at the age of 8 or so, my family doctor had me taking zinc daily just to supplement my own growth hormones and encourage them to do well. Haha, didn't work too great for me, but it ran in the family so that was expected.|`|8Xbc4ok1aa	Weight-bearing exercise and impact loading stimulate bone growth. Generally, three 20 to 30 minute sessions a week are sufficient. If you can and want to do more, go for it! Activities such as walking, running, aerobics or climbing stairs are also excellent forms of exercise to aid in bone growth. <br>  <br>  You should incorporate calcium rich foods into your diet as much as possible. Dairy products and calcium-fortified foods as mentioned earlier are great choices. Try to get between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams a day. <br>  <br>  Do not shy away from dairy products because of the fat content. We now can purchase just about any dairy product available in a low/non-fat version. Milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese all come in low-fat or non-fat varieties. <br>  <br>  Consider vitamin K. This vitamin switches on a bone-building protein called osteocalcin. Experts say 100 micrograms (mcg) a day may be best for bones. Food sources include spinach, Brussels sprouts, roccoli, asparagus, cabbage, coleslaw and collard greens. <br>  <br>  Stop smoking. Smoking increases your risk because it accelerates the metabolism of estrogen, making less available to stimulate bone growth. <br>  <br>  Eat cereals fortified with vitamin D. For your body to absorb and deposit the calcium you get from food, you need vitamin D. <br>  <br>  The supplement option. There is always the supplement choice! <a href="http://www.sato-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sato-growth.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bestsato.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestsato.com</a> l have tried this and it works. ( for adults l suggest 8 month or pro versions)<br>  <br>  Set a time to take that supplement! Plan to take your product at a specific time each day to make taking it a habit. <br>  <br>  Make it magnesium. This mineral actually makes up part of your bone. Your daily goal should be 400 milligrams. Good food sources include nuts, dried beans, crabmeat, spinach, wheat germ, wheat bran and chocolate - yes, chocolate! <br>  <br>  Fortify with calcium. If you do not enjoy foods high in calcium or suffer from lactose intolerance, look for foods fortified with calcium. Cranberry juice and breakfast bars are good choices. <br>  |`|f9209d09bc0d55ee77d8530200df0aa6aa	you cannot do anything to grow taller, apart from growth hormone during adolescence, although there are painful procedures to extend the leg bones in extreme psychological cases.|`|boYu707Haa	Oh, if you are interested in exercises. Then here are some you can try - <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/growtall" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/growtall</a>|`|v0sP9I5yaa	yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose 4 seconds<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body 4 seconds <br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth 8 seconds<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

Like, less weight/many reps to exhaust the muscle rather than make it bigger, and pilates or yoga.  And I don't know if this would make you taller, but make sure you're taking in enough calcium/D/magnesium.  <br>  Good posture can make you seem taller, too.

tqt9yg3vaa	You should go to your dentist. Your oral health has been compromised.
rw9cjrYnaa	There is nothing to be embarrassed about lots of people are scared of the dentist, fyi Novocain doesn't remove all the pain, you will still feel it just not as strong as you would have without it, that would have been excruciating and the dentist would have stopped.  Besides that there are other options such as gas or an iv sedation, just tell the dentist that you don't want to use Novocain.  <br>  <br>  You have nothing to be embarrassed about, a dentists job is to fix your teeth.  I'm having two wisdom teeth removed tomorrow besides that I need my other two out, 6 fillings, a pin, a crown and periodontal scaling, I need a lot of work but that's what i'm paying them for.  Just go, be honest, they will understand.  If you don't go now it will get worse and then you will need to get dentures.  <br>  <br>  The ones in the back sound like wisdom teeth, look in a mirror if there is Absolutely no more room on the back of your gums for teeth then you already got them.  You could have an exposed nerve.  Most people do need their wisdom teeth out and at least a dentist can give you prescription pain killers until you get them pulled.  for the moment you can try taking ibuprofen (if it doesn't interact with your other medications) that is an nsaid pain killer which will reduce inflammation and help numb the pain.  But go to a dentist! It will be ok and you'll feel better in the long run!|`|AA10065077	I'm sorry that you have to feel this way. Is there another dentist you can go to?

A little more costly, but more accurate way of predicting height, is to get a bone age study, which is a simple x-ray.  <br>  Lastly, a simple, but not as acurate way to "guess" your future height, is to double the height you were at 2 1/2 years old for boys and at 2 years old for girls- this can get you a rough idea-I hope that this was helpful!|`|DtJjHBYzaa	In 8th grade you were supposed to be tought all of this.

4YOCOUx1aa	IB Profen is meant for Reducing Inflammation/Swelling (and that alone can be the cause of alot of your pain) Also it is a Painkiller.  <br>    For injuries such as this, its what you need.  Anti-Inflamitory, and Pain Killer.<br>    Also its safe, not addictive at all, and you take too many and it won't be good for your stomach, but you won't die or get poisoned from it.  Still, don't take a crazy amount.  I'm 6ft and 275 roughly (no its not all muscle, i'm a human being not a machine lol) but for me and an injury of mine which was severe, I took 1500mg in the morning and 1500mg at night.  That's a huge dose, so don't come close to it, but I want to put the numbers out their so you know how far NOT to go.  If your around average weight height, don't break 1000mg Once a day (normally each pill is 200mg a piece).  And if you need to take 1000 once a day then you should be seeing a doctor anyways.<br>    Lastly, remember that you ARE suppose to feel the pain no matter what, but the pills just get it down to a level where your miserable but not crying.  <br>  <br>  |`|AA10065077	Ice for 20 min and some ibuprofen.

If you do not have a recipe for basic oatmeal cookies, I have even used the packaged cookie mixes.  You do need to add a little extra water and oil, since you are adding more dry ingredients.  Experiment abit!<br>  <br>  I have this with my morning coffee- another trick I read about to drink more milk.

SBAnbKZ1aa	In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement requires patients who are being prescribed Schedule II and Schedule III narcotics to sign a contract regarding use of the narcotics.  Typically, the terms include your agreeing to use the medication as directed by the doctor, schedule refills days in advance, obtain prescriptions from only that doctor and a specified pharmacy, not use illicit substances in combination with the medication, and not giving the medication to others.  To enforce the terms of the agreement, the doctor may require you to submit to a urine drug screen.  <br>  <br>  If you do not comply with the terms of the agreement, you will be discharged from the practice and will most likely be "red-flagged" in the pharmacy system and will be unable to receive narcotic pain medications in the future.<br>  <br>  The contracts are seen as controversial to some, who believe that a patient's right to privacy is violated by the urinalysis clause and that the agreements undermine the doctor-patient relationship.|`|D8Eyu6BFaa	i see a pain doctor and had to do the same thing. basically, if you're being seen for a bad back and you're getting meds from one dr's office, then you can't doctor hop and get meds from other docs for the same problem. if you do and you get caught, then you will be discharged from their services and may have problems. i see my doc for bad hip and lower back. but i pulled my ACL  and my GP gave me new rx. i called my other doctor and informed them of the situation and they put a note in my file. it's basically to prevent you from doctor hopping and gets narcs from bunch of different doctors. but if you have a new problem that arises that the current pain doctor won't treat, keep them informed before filling other scripts from other doctors and you should be fine. 
xR8woHZRaa	When I first got braces, the first consultation appointment, is really just a discussion, your orthodontist gives you a few pamphlets, and gives your parent (s) a price range thing, and I'm pretty sure you get another appointment to get pictures and molds done of your teeth. Don't worry about it, it's nothing big. But I do warn you, that when you do get braces, (and I'm not trying to discourage you) but your mouth is very sensitive, and it hurts to eat for the first couple days.|`|j4RZqTpvaa	ne prepared for them to criticize u.. it sucks|`|iGHOWsV5aa	consultation s talking about what needs to be done|`|wGdKrmrRaa	I had braces from about 2001-2004... and I now have them on again (for about 3 months now)...<br>  <br>  It's just a consultation, so chances are they're not going to be putting on your braces.

4ff0fd7bb74640e1958bcc90b8338320aa	I hope this helps: How does it matter if you are different? All of us have these poblems where we tink we are totally different from evrybody else. I am really short, and this year I was afraid to met my cousins because I thought they would have grown and I have stayed the same. I thought they would tease me a lot about it, and my aunts, uncles and grandma be disappointed in me for not growing. My aunt is a psycholagist, and she said to just think, "This is the way I am, if you don't like it, that's your problem." She said when she was my age she had a big red mark on her face and there was no makeup where she lived to cover it up. She said she was called names because of it and couldn't make friends. But she studied hard and now her former classmates are jealous of her.|`|808d026d332cc1f5b698d112a748bb97aa	So what if you're different? Each and every person on this earth is different, that's what makes them unique. If someone doesn't like you for who you are, then that's their problem. If they choose to judge people and be ignorant, then I think they have the bigger problem. Just don't listen to those who critisize because they put others down so that they can feel better about themselves. Remember, there are other people who are just like you and they might be going through the same thing. If you want to meet those people, and maybe get some advice from them on how they got through it, maybe you can go to groups that can help. Hope this helps!|`|5zzaYputaa	Jen,<br>  You just need to learn how to accept yourself for who you are.

How else will you ever experience the life you were meant to have unless you continue on and persevere?  Life is hard even when you appear to be conforming to societies idea of "normal".

AA11326471	The skin around the vaginal opening is called the labia.  The labia normally have a darker color in anyone with darker skin and are more purplish in women without much pigment in their skin.  Some of the discoloration is because the skin is very thin and there are a lot of blood vessels in the area which are easily seen the less pigment there is in the skin, so it looks really purple from the blood vessels in white girls and will look darker in women with more color in their skin.

Please.|`|G9UNW0NYaa	You need to get your thyroid tested.  It sounds like you might have a goiter.  It can be benign, or it can be serious, so get it checked out.  I had a small goiter, my thyroid wasn't functioning properly, so I'm an a prescription for it, it was really easy to correct.  Go to the doctor!|`|AA10649627	i would get that checked out because that seems more like a gland issue or a thyroid issue. your glands are typically on the sides of your neck where as the thyroid is in the middle. your thyroid could be enlarged.
V3mpzjcuaa	2 hours late shouldn't be an issue.  From what I understand, you have a range of time by which to take your pill in order to keep them effective.<br>  <br>  So you shouldn't have much to worry about.  Completing missing a pill is a whole different story.  That happened to me once (she forgot to take her pill after a night of drinking) and when we got home we had unprotected sex (we still used condoms even though she was on the pill).  But on this night, we didn't bother about the condom and went about having sex.  I told her I was going to *** inside her and she said okay so I did.  Well, a few weeks later she called to tell me she was pregnant.  <br>  <br>  So it doesn't take much.  But a couple of hours shouldn't be a deal breaker.

I think BCP have a 96% rate of preventing pregnanices with normal use. Normal use means that the girl/woman flucuates a couple to several hours at taking her pill on time. Perfect use is 99% effective, which is taking it exacly the same time each day. So you probably have a 96% chance of not being pregnant. <br>  <br>  Also, this is kind of sad but even if you did get pregnant, continuing to take your pills would most likely abort the fetus. |`|M8a4Qe2Maa	two hours isn't much of a difference. i take mine in the morning and i get up at different times for work, school and weekends so i obviously take them within a few hours of a difference sometimes. i don't think two hours would make much of a difference. i've been on them for a while and have never gotten pregnant. don't worry you're fine. =)|`|7SuislICaa	The pill most likely makes its way through the physlophical tube within 1- 1.30 hours it may have not been activated if you have a slow urinary system.

You're system is gearing up and it needs more fluid to flush out your uterus. If you can't get started, you may not have enough to do the job. At least, that's the way it is with me. <br>  If you drink a lot of water, that could contribute to excess flow. If you crave salty food, that could make you bloat and retain water and then when you menstrate it could contribute to excess water that flushes out with everything else.  Are you aware of your habits to notice a sudden craving? Do you exercise?  If you exercised, it could help loosen you up and get you to relax and the cramps should subside. (A little walking for 20 minutes would work fine.) If you exercise too much, it could prevent you from being more regular.<br>  When you start to cramp up, brace yourself. Eat your vegetables, get some B vitamins and watch how much you drink. (It would help relieve your stress.)  Watch how much soda you drink.Try not to chug it down. You might find you crave the sodium. After a while, once you notice a pattern, then you have clear signs and you know what you're dealing with. If you ate healthy all the time, then craved soda and junk food at certain times, then that would be a good sign and you would know what to do.<br>  You're going to need time. You're young.

2622a71159b5d0b9e3f1310e8a42eae2aa	Why dont you try something homemade? What I do is... Brown up some ground beef (or use chicken or turkey whichever you like best). Then drain it. Then in the pot with the beef i put organic low sodium diced tomatoes, organic kidney beans, frozen white corn, some salsa, and whatever else you like. I make this once in a while and i make plenty of it. Then everyday for work i take a little container full alone with a salad. Oh it works so well! And it helps to lose weight, cause there are not many calories in the meal. Good luck to you!
uTKCjmKgaa	one of my closest friends has had pretty much the same problem, and she now tries to first of all eat very slowly first thing, and always has a protein/malt milkshake or slimfast. one of those meal replacement drinks. purely because it helps fill her up. and before she goes to bed she has 3 glasses of water because 80% of hunger is actually thirst, but your body gets confused.<br>  <br>  so while 3 glasses of water before sleeping may not be that helpful to you, (i know i couldnt sleep with a full bladder) <br>  try maybe adding extra drinks throughout your day to hydrate you more, and you may feel less hungry as a result in the morning.<br>  <br>  i hope you manage to get past your bulimia, i know how difficult it is. good luck.|`|stjT95CEaa	Listen sweetie you are destroying you body. I have a friend that went through this same thing it never goes away you will always thing about it and your weight. <br>  <br>  You are not fat, you need to be healthy don't look at the t.v. or magazines and think they are happy.    <br>  <br>  Have you looked into the affects of this illness, your teeth will rot and your hair will fall out, you can have kidney and liver problem, you will start to lose muscle and not fat and also develop dementia early on in life. This illness isn't something you can stop and everything will be o.k it will affect you for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  If you want to be thin look into eating right meat in small amounts,veggies,fruit, granola things like that and excerise 3 days a week take a yoga class, it will elongate your body and help with the maintenance of your muscles.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this helps you, it is hard for you, your friends and family to deal with. Be strong and find out what the real issue is and why you are doing this to yourself<br>  <br>  Respectfully your.|`|Iu1obWb9aa	It sounds like you are getting around 1000-1300 Calories per day.  Eating more is good.  <br>  <br>  Its harder to get from being underweight to normal than from overweight to normal.  Try taking on that challenge.<br>  <br>  Do you know your ideal body weight/how many calories you need?  How tall are you?  How old?  I can do the calculations for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Based on height & weight alone (I don't have your age), 135 is an "ideal" weight for you.  A few extra pounds wouldn't be bad for you.  If you need anything let me know.
AA10592697	It looks like Ste A means well, but some of the things he said aren't quite right.<br>  <br>  First of all, there are no carbs in egg yolk.  That's all fat.<br>  <br>  Second of all, I don't think jogging is the most effective way to lose weight because it only works your lower half.  Swimming and use of an elliptical machine (which mimics cross-country skiing) work your whole body, and will therefore automatically burn more calories.<br>  <br>  Anyway, for you, given your bad knees and bad neighborhood, I'd recommend a workout video like Tae Bo or Turbo Jam.  I own Turbo Jam and have used it to keep off the weight I lost a year or so ago, and I know they have modifications for a low-impact workout (to keep from damaging your knees).  I would think that Tae Bo has low-impact modifications as well, but I can't personally guarantee it.  A friend of mine has used Tae Bo to lose weight.<br>  <br>  These are pretty fun workouts and can be done in the privacy and safety of your own home.<br>  <br>  As for caloric intake, don't go below 1600 calories - you're still growing, and you don't want to send your body into starvation mode.  Try to eat foods high in fiber (berries [especially raspberries and blackberries if you can afford them], whole wheat cereals, etc.) and drink at least eight 8- to 10-ounce glasses of water a day.<br>  <br>  Your goal is a little ambitious and I'm not sure you can achieve it in a healthy manner, but if you focus your efforts, you should be able to take off 12-15 pounds in the next eleven weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sjoQwiKyaa	The amount of fat you burn depends on your diet, and your exercise. As far as your diet goes, you need to be eating the right amount of calories, but the right calories. Cut down on carbohydrates like bread, egg yolk, pasta etc, and increase the amount of fruit and vegetables you are eating, along with fresh chicken, fish, and lean red meat. Eat 5-6 smaller meals per day, spreading out your calorie intake. This will highten your body's metabolic rate meaning that you will naturally burn fuel quicker. Don't eat after 2 hours before you go to bed. Any fuel you consume that isn't burned will just be stored as fat. Drink plenty of water.<br>  With your exercise, the general guideline is atleast 30 minutes of cardio work 3 times a week. But this is the very minumum if you want to lose fat. The rule is simple - the more you do, and the more intense it is, the more fat you burn off. Jogging is the best exercise to burn fat, and if you can jog at a steady pace for 25-30 minutes 3 times a week, then you will see a difference soon. As I said though, the more you do, the more fat you'll burn...simple. If you need to work up to this level of fitness, then start by riding a bike, or using an elliptical or rowing machine. You can also walk for 5 minutes, and jog for 5 minutes and keep that up for 30 minutes instead until you can keep going. If you can't jog atall though, then cycling is the next best thing. <br>  If your going to do cardio work try to do it as early as possible. The body responds better to cardio work earlier in the morning, and the fat burning effect carries on for some time afterwards. <br>  <br>  If you follow these guidelines, then you should definately see an improvement in the results your getting. Try to weigh yourself on a weekly basis rather than a daily one though, as from day to day your weight can fluctuate a lot due to the amount of water and waste your body is carrying.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and keep it up.|`|7mkLtFQAaa	Just DANCE in your room if you can go out side to run or get on the bus and go to safe park and play with so other kids  on satudays. 20lbs in a 11 weeks you can lose that in 3 weeks if u just become motivated with your life and work out and eat right.|`|AueBxzcVaa	sit ups, push ups, no more burger king ... no soda, no fatty foods.............. if u cant run try swimming or walking|`|FssgcYX9aa	Mathematically, a pound consists of 3500 calories, to lose 1 pound you must eat a deficit of 3500 cals.

Which would not be healthy at all. <br>  However, you are not a robot and everyone varies so this formula will not necessarily work entirely accurately.<br>  <br>  As to exercise, how about buying a exercise trampoline of an exercise bike and doing 30 mins to an hour each day, in front of the tv or whatever just to get your heart beating and burn off some cals.|`|p4nwIkbHaa	Try<br>  Prevention.com<br>   <br>  <br>  :D|`|vNV4X2kgaa	Cut 500 calories from your daily intake.

KIHah5uvaa	il tipo di gruppo sanguigno non centra nulla... le associazioni tipo avis raccolgono il sangue di ogni gruppo, perchè serve di tutti i tipi. Quando si fa una trasfusione, quando è possibile e non si è in urgenza, è preferibile utilizzare un sangue omologo, ovvero dello stesso gruppo del ricevente... ci sono meno rischi di incompatibilità. bisogna essere maggiorenni per poter donare, come per iscriversi a tante altre associazioni di volontariato (es. ADMO, AIDO, AVO...). Il consenso dei genitori non basta. La donazione del sangue è tecnicamente una cosa invasiva per il corpo e si pensa che un minorenne possa non essere nelle condizioni ideali... lo so che può sembrare una stupidata, ma così è. inoltre dare il consenso non basta per donare, bisogna fare controlli ematici completi, visita medica, elettrocardiogramma, rx torace... esistono inoltre altri motivi di esclusione dalla donazione... visita il sito internet dell'Avis o vai in una delle loro sedi... troverai tutte le informazioni che ti servono. nulla ti vieta di iscriverti appena compi diciotto anni come ho fatto io...|`|5TVkIcgFaa	penso di si...ma bisogna vedere se hai il gruppo sanguigno adatto....se hai H0+ come me lo puoi donare a tutti perchè è universale..|`|KiZ5L6ZFaa	si bisogna essere maggiorenni,sei sei una donna puoi donare ogni 4 mesi mentre un uomo ogni 3 mesi,il gruppo sanguigno va bene perché lo danno solo a quelli che hanno il stesso gruppo ,alla prima donazione ti fanno solo gli esami per controllare il tuo stato di salute in seguito poi ti fanno contemporaneamente il prelievo per le analisi e quello per la donazione|`|YVDp17jNaa	No i minorenni non possono donare il sangue...Neanche con il consenso dei genitori.Devi essere maggiorenne, pesare almeno 50 chili non aver avuto rapporti non protetti negli sei mesi precedenti alla donazione(a meno che non si ha una relazione stabile), non aver assunto farmaci nelle 48 ore precedenti alla donazione...e soprattutto essere in buona salute!!|`|f17cd1f349a8e597dc0c2bfe9bead019aa	Devi essere maggiorenne e devi pesare almeno 50kg, il cariotipo del sangue non è importante perchè vengono accettate tutte le donazioni purchè la persona che dona sia sana!

AA10820398	One of the main keys to maintaing energy levels and optimal health,.. is to be consuming a vital, cleansing and regenerative daily diet,.. composed of mainly "raw", "organic" and unprocessed, Live foods. <br>  <br>  Detoxing the body of accumulated toxins that are a result of growing up in and living in the modern world or processed foods, pollution and high stress is critical to maintaining optimal levels of energy for life. ..... Raw and organic fruits and veggies are an important element towards cleansing the body.<br>  <br>  A second important aspect of this, is to be eating the right proportions of carbohydrates versus protiens for your particular body, over the course of each day. <br>  <br>  Avoiding alcohol, caffein, sugar, refined carbohydrates (cakes, cookies, breads, pasta etc.), is very important, as these foods will weaken the body and thus lower your energy levels. .... Also avoid processed meats or deli meats and commercially grown conventional beef. ... Try to find organically raised, "grass fed" beef. ... as well as organically raised, free range chicken, turkey etc.<br>  <br>  There are natural food supplements which you can purchase which will add high potency natural nutrients to your daily diet to boost your energy level and gently detoxify the body. <br>  One very good one is a micro-algae product called; SPIRULINA - .... This is a natural food that you can safely consume as much of as you like. .. You can find it at most any health food store or vitamin supplement shop. ..... Experiment with how much of this you take over time, until you are aware that you are experiencing a lift in energy from it. It can be purchased in either capsule, tablet or powder form. .. I recommend the capsule form, as it is easy to measure and swallow. <br>  <br>  Another great food to add to your daily diet would be freshly juiced  'Wheat Grass Juice". ... Many health food stores sell freshly juiced wheat grass,.. but if not,.. you can grow your own and juice it right in your own kitchen.  There are a number of web sites that sell the equipment to grow and juice your own wheat grass,.. but you will want to try consuming the juice first to see if you like it, ... so find a health food store near you that juices and sells it. ....... If you do decide to grow your own,.. here is one site that sells what you need to provide your own: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.growwheatgrass.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.growwheatgrass.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  An excellent form of exercise that you can adapt to your schedule needs and do as little or as much of it as you choose, .. is  Hatha Yoga. .... Hatha Yoga is also revitalising and detoxifying when practiced regularly. ............. <br>  A good book for beginners is:<br>  THE SIVANANDA COMPANION TO YOGA<br>  <br>  Of course it is important to get some regular aerobic exercise where you are getting your heart rate up and breaking a decent sweat. ... If you do not pursue yoga in any depth (which would provide aerobic exercise), ... a simple yet excellent aerobic exercise is jumping rope. ...

In short, these are minute, meaningless micro injuries.  Real clots, which can lead to potentially fatal pulmonary thromboembolic disease are usually nested in the largest veins of the body, i.e. the femoral veins.  Leg veins can also develop clots but are much less likely to lead to embolus dissemination.  Even large superficial vein clots are relatively free from embolic outcomes.  Therefore, hickeys do not cause the type of blood clot you're probably worried about.|`|OFTaPfaYaa	A hickey is basically a bruise. A bruise is blood that is under the skin.
c95121091e48b0b475b22974ebdfd3bdaa	Thanks for asking,<br>  I am a nurse and I hope, you would not ignore my answer.<br>  <br>  Clostridium Difficile, is a bacteria that normally lives in our intestine. It becomes nasty to the gut when, the balance of the gut is disturbed (balance between good and bad bacteria) due to over use or misuse of antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Normally, the sufferer presents with a frequent passage of passing loose stools, fever, tiredness and abdominal pain . The stool smells really offensive. It is normally diagnosed with a stool sample and the victim will be isolated once, the diagnosis is confirmed. <br>  The choice of antibiotic is Flagyl(metronidazole) which should be given orally/ enterally to gain the maximum effect. It is not very effective when , given intravenously(into the veins).<br>  <br>  Complete cure is possible and the person will start to pass normal(formed) stool with a less frequency which is a sign of recovery. A strict hand hygiene is very important while you care the victim and no other practices like using alcohol gel ,is  recommended for the hand hygiene. Please adhere to the infection control policy of the unit/hospital. The loose stool should be contained ,failing which may spread the infection . In the hospital environment, they may use specially designed faecal collector to contain the stool.<br>  <br>  Untreated infection can cause intestinal perforation that will eventually lead to septic shock and death. In the hospital , the person will be considered free of infection(c-diff) when, he receives  three consecutive stool samples negative.|`|o70Omoj2aa	It's called Clostridium Difficile, it's an infection that causes diarrhea which is foul smelling.  It is usually treated with antibiotic called Flagyl.|`|mgR0HQsQaa	Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a bacterium that is present naturally in the gut of around 3% of adults and 66% of children.<br>  <br>  C. diff doesn't cause any problems in healthy people. However, some antibiotics that are used to treat other health conditions can interfere with the balance of good bacteria in the gut. When this happens, C. diff bacteria can multiply and cause symptoms such as diarrhoea and fever.<br>  <br>  Because C. diff infections are usually caused by antibiotics, most cases usually happen in a healthcare environment such as a hospital or care home. Older people are most at risk from infection, with the majority of cases (80%) occurring in people over the age of 65.<br>  <br>  Most people with a C. diff infection make a full recovery. However, in very rare cases the infection can be fatal.<br>  <br>  The number of C. diff cases has risen from 22,000 a year in 2002 to almost 45,000 in 2004. One of the main reasons for this rise is the improvement in tests to diagnose the infection, but there has clearly been an increase in the number of cases.<br>  <br>  C. diff infections can be prevented by good hygiene practices in healthcare environments. However, it is extremely contagious and is spread very easily.<br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment:<br>  <br>  C. difficile can be treated with certain antibiotics, and in some cases, probiotic (good bacteria) treatments may be prescribed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Probably about two weeks before he is in the clear.

Once you figure out how many seconds between each hiccups, hold your breath just before it occurs. and soon it will go away.|`|jNEgTYCMaa	"Hic!" You've just hiccuped for what seems like the tenth time since you finished your big dinner. Wonder where these funny noises are coming from? The part to blame is your diaphragm (say: die-uh-fram). This is a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of your chest, and all hiccups start here.<br>  <br>  The diaphragm almost always works perfectly. When you inhale, it pulls down to help pull air into the lungs. When you exhale, it pushes up to help push air out of the lungs. But sometimes the diaphragm becomes irritated. When this happens, it pulls down in a jerky way, which makes you suck air into your throat suddenly. When the air rushing in hits your voice box, you're left with a big hiccup.<br>  <br>  Some things that irritate the diaphragm are eating too quickly or too much, an irritation in the stomach or the throat, or feeling nervous or excited. Almost all cases of the hiccups last only a few minutes. Some cases of the hiccups can last for days or weeks, but this is very unusual, and it's usually a sign of another medical problem.|`|a41iQcyaaa	air bubbles

ft81hR5aaa	To even get your abs to come out you need to do cardio, you can't target one specific part of your body to burn fat off, it comes off of the whole thing.  Just increase how much you do of each, your abs aren't used to them, you just arent doing enough at a time.  But once again, do all the ab work outs you want, you wont end up with a 6 pack unless you do the cardio to burn off the layer of fat that covers it.

These questions need to be answered in order to provide you with an accurate diagnostic. <br>  <br>  A little information on Acid Reflux Pills: here is the current scam regarding "acid reflux disease". Your doctor probably told you that he/she is prescribing you a pill that will get rid of your "excess acid". the problem is, you don't have "excess acid" as he/she claims. The truth is: Your stomach isn't producing enough acid! The food you are eating isn't being digested properly. When you take an antacid (tums, rolaids, maalox) it doesn't get rid of your "excess acid", it gets rid of ALL the acid. Your stomach then goes into "panic mode" and starts producing mass amounts of acid (to account for the lack of acid / digestive enzymes) to digest the food, resulting in that feeling of "relief". <br>  <br>  Sure the drug commercials sound lovely. Nexium, the "purple pill", "helps heal the damage" or Pepcid AC "stop the heartburn before it starts" or whatever the current slogan is.<br>  <br>  AstraZeneca claims that it's product  Nexium actually heals the damage caused by "acid reflux" to the lining of the esophagus from all that acid churning up. Between the launch of esomeprazole in 2001 and 2005, the drug has netted AstraZeneca about $14.4 billion.<br>  <br>  "Big money is at stake: Pepcid is the nation's No. 2 heartburn drug behind Tums with $139 million in annual sales at supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart Stores Inc., according to Chicago research firm Information Resources Inc."<br>  <br>  "New over-the-counter products have the opportunity to take market share from other medicines," said Dan Popowics, an analyst with Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati. "I think the over-the-counter market plays to P&G's strengths, particularly their relationships with retailers."<br>  <br>  "He said pharmaceuticals are a promising business for P&G because they provide growth and bigger profit margins."

Switch treats for fruit ( who doesn't love fruit : ) ) and junk food for chicken, fish or meat do not use oils to cook, just throw them on a clean pan and use pepper or other spices to give a nice taste.

So you will need to exercise along with controlling your diet. Track everything you eat and drink,  total up the amounts and see exactly how much you are consuming. If you exercise you can use more calories. It takes 1 mile to burn 100 calories. You will need to do some strengthening with weights and run/walk to be effective. It is not going to be fast. It is better to change your way of eating than to get on to some fad diet that you can not do for the rest of your life.|`|GGxr4K0Naa	Low Carb Dieting Tip<br>  Your rate of metabolism dictates how many calories you burn. Heredity, gender, age, body size. diet and nutrition, activity level, and your overall health factor in on determining how high or low your metabolism is. It is normal for metabolism levels to lower as a person ages. Because of this it is important to begin stepping up your exercise routines in your thirties and forties.<br>  <br>  Ways to Boost Your Metabolism<br>  <br>  Eat Regularly - Eating 5-6 small meals throughout the day will give you energy throughout the day--helping you to burn calories. Whereas, calories eaten during larger meals tend to get stored as fat.<br>  Maintain a Balanced Diet - Not only how often you eat is important, but your food choices are equally as important. Nurture you body with the appropriate balance of protein and carbs. <br>  <br>  Eating whole foods rather than processed food gives your digestive system a workout that burns calories. For example: choose an apple over apple juice. <br>  Workout with Weights - Building muscle mass will replace stored fat. As you build muscle tissue your metabolism increases. <br>  Don't Forget Cardio - You need to get that heart rate up and breathe a little heavier. Twenty to thirty minutes of cardiovascular activity 5 days a week is recommended. Brisk walking or swimming are good. Or utilize exercise equipment (exercise bike, treadmill, or elliptical trainer)<br>  Fruits and vegetables are clearly an important part of a good diet. Almost everyone can benefit from eating more of them, but variety is as important as quantity. No single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy. The key lies in the variety of different fruits and vegetables that you eat.<br>  Some basic fruit and vegetable tips:<br>  ? Try to eat more fruits and vegetables. If you need 2,000 calories a day to maintain your weight and health, aim for at least nine servings (4? cups) a day. <br>  ? Choose a variety of different fruits and vegetables. It's easy to get into a rut when it comes to the food you eat. Break out and try a wider variety - include dark-green, leafy vegetables; yellow, orange, and red fruits and vegetables; cooked tomatoes; and citrus fruits.|`|HsgUZ09saa	I have had a terrible time losing weight for six years.  nothing worked for me unitl 4 months ago.

I'm now using the advanced program and i look pretty good and have lost over 10 lbs and 3 inches on my butt - without dieting - that's another positive.   check it out if you want - www.thereshapeworkout.com|`|NzY7rUt1aa	I have studied exercising and weight-loss for fifteen years and the number one misconception is that you weight too much. Dont stop reading if you want a hot body. You are not trying to loose weight you are trying to loose fat . There is a big difference, I no girls that are 5ft weight 110 and have hot bodies. This is because they have muscle. So if you want to look better gain muscle and burn fat. <br>  <br>  OK now ill explain how:<br>  <br>  Now one day eat normally as you would and count the calories you ate. If you do not no the amount of calories of a cartain food look it up. <br>  <br>  Lets say you ate 2,000 calories <br>  the next day 1950<br>  then 1900<br>  then 1850<br>  then1800 <br>  <br>  cut it down slowly or else youll not loose weight and even if you do youll gain the weight back. <br>  <br>  But cutting down on calories dont cut it take sugary and fatty substances out of your diet.<br>  <br>  no chips<br>  no soda<br>  no cake .....<br>  <br>  Also increase the protein intake.  Eat proteins with low fat like chicken, fish, egg whites, whey protein shakes are good. Most of all eat your fruits and vegetables . Do not eat to late because it is a fact that you do not burn many calories sleeping so you gain weight by eating before you sleep. Eat small frequent meals. Meaning eat 5 times a day of small meals example:<br>  <br>  when you wake up have a fruit (maby apple) and oatmeal <br>  then 2-3 hours later <br>  another samll meal and so on the best meal items, <br>  <br>  eggs,<br>  protein shake,<br>  gereen vegetables (salads) remember lots of dieters eat salad but ruin it by putting dressing. No dressing its not healthy. <br>  yogurt<br>  orange juice (healthy but no more than 1 glass daily)<br>  if you drink milk do not drink whole milk. fat reduced milk<br>  brown rice- no white rice<br>  beans...<br>  <br>  high protein low carb's. But do not be afriad of all carbs you need carbs like oatmeal, brown rice, pasta... just dont overload <br>  <br>  Also remember to walk 10 minutes after breakfast!!!<br>  <br>  You still have not done enought to loose weight <br>  <br>  You must EXERCISE!!!!<br>  <br>  ok i reccomend 10 minutes of walking every day after breakfast. <br>  <br>  and do extra exercises 5 days a week. This includes cardio. Most people think they can loose weight with just dieting. Nope you must do 30+ min cardio 5 days weekly <br>  <br>  Its is important to vary what you do and not let your body get too used to the exercises, <br>  <br>  Things to do for cardio: <br>  <br>  walk (fast) <br>  jog<br>  sprint<br>  cycling<br>  swimming<br>  running stairs<br>  jumpring jacks<br>  jump ropes <br>  play sports (maby join a track team) <br>  <br>  I no a lot of girls think theyll become manly by working out but it shapes the body and maked you look better. <br>  <br>  So i reccomend working out 3- 4 days a week. This will tighten your buttox and chest. help create a flat stomach and get rid of flab on the arms and legs. <br>  <br>  Please workout-- <br>  I reccomend working out no longer than 50 min 4 days a week. The reason 50 min is because when you lift weights after 50 minutes your body breaks down muscle for energy instead of fat so i usually go 45 min <br>  my schedule:<br>  <br>  thursday- chest and back<br>  friday- abs<br>  saturday- legs <br>  sunday- arms <br>  <br>  Follow every thing i said and youll loose weight. It is a slow process and unlike dieting these effects will be life- term without having to starve your self all you have to do is eat healthy. <br>  <br>  Stay motivated and even when you feel you cant loose weight and get muscle you can its a slow process. <br>  <br>  So it may take over a few months maby even a year. <br>  <br>  THE CHOICE IS YOURS FALL FOR THOSE FAKE COMMERCIALS ABOUT LOOSING 10 POUNDS IN A WEEK OR WORK HARD UNTIL YOU ACHIEVE THE BODY YOU WANT.<br>  <br>  -- REMEMBER THE CHOICE IS YOURS GOOD LUCK|`|yy16KCuTaa	imani stop worrin bout ur wieght u look fine

Dnoanpohaa	In order to have a six-pack you need to have an extremely low percentage of body fat. If you don't, no amount of sit-ups or crunches will get you one. What that kind of spot training will do is strengthen the muscles beneath the layer of fat on your abdomen. It will not make your abs show through *unless* you already have very little body fat.<br>  <br>  So, the answer, even though it isn't easy or particularly fast, is to do aerobic exercise that will burn fat all over, and work on bulking up your abs so that when you do lose the fat you have some nice muscle definition. There are a number of good exercises that work your abs... if I were you, I'd google "ab workout" or something like that.|`|9zxu5oPAaa	walk to the rear of the local 7-11 or quickie mart.|`|AA10765775	I like the first answer.......but I'll do you one better....call up your buddies, and have them bring you one.....|`|EwMB79Gjaa	do  push up i guess.|`|ekYx7xaBaa	I got mine doing cardio, doing this workout <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY</a> about 3 times a day, and eating a healthy diet.

u4wPmfpOaa	No. Not every two months, per se. You can change your routine when you think you've plateaued. What happens is this: When you do the same workout, over and over, your body conditions itself to that workout. If you want to see a change in your body, you need to change your workout. For example, most dieters hit a plateau at some point in their diet, even though they're working out the same as when they were losing weight. Again, the body conditions itself to that workout. To break that cycle, you have to change your workout. Also, it depends of whether or not your doing a varied enough workout to use all of your muscles. I wouldn't say that you HAVE to change your workout every two months, but I DO think that changing your workout, periodically, helps your overall fitness! Hope this helps!|`|BllFjDdOaa	Well if you work out too much of one specific part of your body, it can get used to it. For instance, when you work out your muscles, they rip and then regrow as bigger, without a rest in between, you aren't giving this process time to work. It is a good idea to evenly distribute the workout anyways. Don't wanna make the rest of your body jealous ;)|`|RFa5A6mXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I've tried so many different diets in the last 10 years that I can say now, they don't work!<br>  A few months ago, I came across a great product for weight loss and like many others I was skeptical about it. But I really wanted to lose weight and I tried it. The results were excellent and I lost 20 pounds in 2 months. I felt fantastic and I dropped another 5 pounds safely. That's why I recommend you check this product at <br>  <a href="http://www.get-slender.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.get-slender.info</a>  where they have a free trial and you only pay 5.49$ shipping and handling.<br>  Good luck!|`|rRBWSOgGaa	Great post!

You can check the website at <br>  <a href="http://www.they-fit.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.they-fit.info</a> , I had a free trial and paid less than 6.00$ shipping and handling. Best of luck!|`|6ZijgcMmaa	They say it's best to change every 2 weeks because your body will get adjusted to the routine and it will not work your system as well.  It needs variely to develop and work it well, so your system works harder, and don't just get used to the routine.|`|THaHIVrjaa	Yes you need to vary your workouts so that your muscles don't adjust to the workout. There are many different muscles in your body that most people who work out don't even build. They stick to the standard motions and do the same for years. You need to work out differently all the time if you want real world and functional muscle.

jkeyELdraa	Building up the muscles in your chest will help shrink your boobs.  Bench pressing is great, but another fantastic exercise that really isolates your chest is butterflies.  Lie on your back (ideally on the bench for bench pressing) with appropriate weight dumbbells (if you're not sure, start with 5 lbs and go from there).  Stretch your arms out completely to the sides of your body (making a T), and contract the muscles in your chest to "flap" your arms like a butterfly does with his wings.  You might feel like you're getting bigger at first, but the muscle will help tighten up and burn that fatty tissue that makes your boobs so big (not a bad thing as far as appearance goes, but if you'd like to get smaller, that's the way).|`|VQGLu8xmaa	Usually when you loose weight that is the first place to go.

Así, el goce sexual es buscado aquí al margen de ‘la relación sexual requerida por el orden moral; aquella relación que realiza el sentido íntegro de la mutua entrega y de la procreación humana en el contexto de un amor verdadero’ (CDF, decl. "Persona humana" 9).<br>  <br>  Para emitir un juicio justo acerca de la responsabilidad moral de los sujetos y para orientar la acción pastoral, ha de tenerse en cuenta la inmadurez afectiva, la fuerza de los hábitos contraídos, el estado de angustia u otros factores psíquicos o sociales que reducen, e incluso anulan la culpabilidad moral.<br>  <br>  mi comentario<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la inmadures afectiva, podríamos considerar a los adolescentes, que además están en cambios hormonales, por lo que se puede dar con más frecuencia esta practica, esto no justifica o quiere decir que sea bueno en ellos, pero es entendible y dispensable hasta cierto punto. más hay que dar a conocer la verdad en cuanto a este tema, para no atentar contra la castidad el amor a Dios y los hermanos. al dejarte de masturbar puedes enfocar todo esa energía en donarte con caridad y entrega a los demás por amor a Dios.<br>  Catecismo de la iglesia católica<br>  <a href="http://es.catholic.net/sexualidadybioeti..." rel="nofollow">http://es.catholic.net/sexualidadybioeti...</a>|`|vNcyoiHEaa	Bueno  antes te decían que te saldrían pelos en la palma de la mano,  pero ya a tus 16 ..

QMC6fpDkaa	La serie è ambientata a Springfield, cittadina situata in uno Stato non meglio identificato[31][32]: nell'ultimo episodio della stagione undici, intitolato "Dietro la risata" (in originale "Behind the Laughter"), i Simpson sono descritti come ?una famiglia del nord del Kentucky?. Invece, in I Simpson - Il film, Ned Flanders, mentre ammira il paesaggio attorno a Springfield insieme a Bart, afferma che la città è situata vicino ai confini con gli Stati dell'Ohio, del Nevada, del Maine e del Kentucky. Ma, mentre Ohio e Kentucky sono confinanti, Nevada e Maine si trovano da tutt'altra parte.<br>  <br>  Groening ha dichiarato che Springfield ha molto in comune con Portland, cittadina situata nell'Oregon in cui è cresciuto,[33] mentre il nome "Springfield" sarebbe stato scelto perché molto comune, dato che appare in decine di città di oltre trenta Stati.[34] La geografia di Springfield e delle sue vicinanze è particolamente variabile, caratterizzata da zone costiere, deserti, vasti terreni agricoli, alte montagne, e qualunque cosa sia richiesta dalla sceneggiatura.[35] Anche se la città è relativamente piccola, contiene tutti gli edifici che normalmente si trovano solo nelle grandi metropoli (come l'aeroporto internazionale o gli studi televisivi).<br>  <br>  Approfittando della presenza di molte città chiamate Springfield, la Fox e il quotidiano USA Today hanno indetto nell'estate del 2007 una votazione nella quale si chiedeva di scegliere quale fra le tante Springfield fosse la più verosimile all'ambientazione della serie. Il concorso si è poi concluso con la vittoria della Springfield del Vermont, di 9.300 abitanti, che ha così conseguito l'onore di ospitare la prima mondiale de I Simpson - Il film.[36]|`|RjfZglUSaa	Sprigfield è una piccola cittadina che si trova in america.....<br>  L'atlante lo hanno inventato apposta x domande come queste...sai....?? =)|`|WR6RNfQraa	A casa mia|`|g1uq9fu9aa	in giro per il mondo!!|`|IX3HMrHoaa	qui ce' la cosa che ti han detto sopra..|`|QP6e4F84aa	l'america è disseminata di città che si chiamano <br>  springfield<br>  percui fai tu una vale l'altra<br>  comunque io voto per quella dello <br>  stato di new yorke|`|XjYYh7dBaa	E' una teoria molto argomentata quella che sostiene che la Springfield dei Simpson sia in realtà Portland,città dello Stato dell'Oregon, appunto, che confina a sud con la California e con il Nevada.Matt Groening ,creatore della serie,è appunto originario dell' Oregon.|`|kLd24Iiiaa	Massachusetts|`|wtx7qNrlaa	si trova in america.... ma questo è ovvio... in realtà non esiste secondo il mio parere... però non ne sono convinta!!|`|03aSDMDSaa	neanche quelli del cartone lo sanno...è una scusa x nn far sapere ke nn sanno dv è springfield

Try to cut back in carbs a bit, but don't cut them out completely. Your body does need some to work right.  <br>  <br>  And also, it really depends on the kind of exercise you are doing. Cardio is good for you, but you should also implement some resistence and weight training into your routine. It will burn more fat, and also shape at the same time.|`|Qz6LoSFlaa	If you lose weight fast, you'll be more prone of gaining it back ten-fold.  Go at this diet thing slowly.<br>  <br>  If you love sodas, like I do, do NOT cut yourself off from them cold-turkey.  Slowly wean yourself from the fattening things you like.<br>  <br>  Drink your 8 glasses of water a day, and stay away from those carbs!  (Pasta, bread, etc.)<br>  <br>  Diet meals do not really help- not if you're talking about Lean Cuisine or something.  True, they may have fewer calories or carbs, but the nutrition facts are still less than ideal on thos packages.  I say stay away from them as best you can.<br>  <br>  Exercise at least 20 minutes 3 times  a week.  This will help boost metabolism.  Drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit... this will also help boost metabolism.|`|Jyjy9trkaa	The problem is, everyone wants to lose weight and fast. <br>  <br>  Some real suggestions are NOT to eat diet food because in reality you eat more calories because you think you are eating less so you eat way more than you should. <br>  <br>  to be totally honest the fastest way is to literally not eat.

Once you learn how to organize each hour of your day, losing the weight and keeping it off will be a piece of cake. Ah, sorry about that.<br>  <br>  The quickest and most consistent way to get yourself on a weight loss schedule, is to write it out. If you rely only on planning it out in your mind, you'll have an easier time of making and excuse of not following it then you would if it was on a sheet of paper. Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.<br>  <br>  Just think about what you want to do for the next several hours. After that time has passed, this time write down what you want to do for several more hours. After you've completed this little assignment, I'm sure you will feel that you felt a stronger urge to do the things you wrote down, then the things you just planned out in your head.<br>  <br>  Don't be surprised though. It's like that with every thing you do. For example, what would be more real to you: imagining a bright red apple or holding one in your hand. If you're like 99.9% of the people out there, it's holding it in your hand.<br>  <br>  By writing down what you need to do each hour of the day as it pertains to your weight loss program is the same thing. It makes it more real to you than just planning it out in your mind. So, if you want to make quick work of losing that excess baggage, write out a schedule.

aic8vilHaa	Sleep does help alot.It's alot like a reboot for your body.What you need to do is worry about carlorie intake.You need meats for vitamins.And slow down on any intake of potatoes,they are startchy and when startch breaks down in the body it turns into sugar.Also if you eat alot of fast food i really wouldn't stop but would switch to healthier choices.To many people stop eating at restraunts when they are on a diet then after they've lost the weight they start back up and gain the weight back.Salt intake is another good thing to watch.Your body needs salt but a over abundence is a bad thing.It can cause water weight to build up on your body.Try to keep your carlorie intake to 2,000 a day.Excerize really depends on what you have time for.Even getting on the treadmil for 15 mins a day can help alot.You really need to give the weight loss alittle time.It's a big adjustment for your body.Weight you lose at first is usually water weight.Fat loss can take more time.Bike riding burns twice as many calories as a treadmil so that might be something to check into.|`|ewmwMbyDaa	Whether you are a serious athlete, always on the go, or simply looking to improve your health, Herbalife’s Core Products nourish your body at the cellular level, so you can achieve optimum health.<br>  <br>  Formula 1 Nutritional Shake Mix is a healthy meal with up to 19 essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients in six delicious flavours that can help support weight management.

Remember that we should be eating 12 servings of fruit and veggies per day. Don't forget however that your body also needs plenty of protein or you will start to lose muscle. You don't want that to happen. <br>  <br>  You mentioned shakes as part of your diet. This is an excellent idea when you don't have time to make a healthy meal. Since you have a little one, I'm guessing that it can get pretty tough to have the time to make healthy meals. <br>  <br>  Don't just choose any shake however. Many of the one's on the market are junk. What you need to look for are replacement meal shakes that are certified low glycemic. This means that they will not spike your blood sugar. Doing that could actually lead to cravings, emotional eating, and more weight gain. <br>  <br>  Here is a website I recommend where you can get some quality shakes. <br>  <br>  www.healthbud.usana.com<br>  <br>  Since it sounds like your diet needs more protein, I would recommend you try the Soyamax. It has 26 grams of protein per serving. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your weight loss|`|cFFNjwwGaa	Okay, here is what is currently working for me and has worked for me in the past. I'm doing this right now to lose weight for my wedding in January. In 3 weeks i've lost 12 pounds and 16 inches. <br>  <br>  The diet:<br>  <br>  I've modified a version of "the grapefruit diet" This is one of those fad diets, but is actually good if you modify it to make it something you can stick with your entire life and think of as a healthy lifestyle change instead of a quick fix.<br>  <br>  Breakfast:<br>  eggs (for healthier choice, use eggbeaters, or cut out the number of yolks)<br>  bacon (again, for healthier options, use turkey bacon)<br>  unsweetened grapefruit juice<br>  water<br>  <br>  Lunch<br>  salad<br>  lean meat <br>  unsweetened grapefruit juice<br>  water<br>  <br>  Dinner<br>  same as lunch<br>  <br>  Snacks<br>  fresh fruits or veggies<br>  healthy cereal with skim milk (i love special k red berries)<br>  <br>  NOTES: This is essentially a low carb diet if you follow it strictly. i modified to add back healthy carbs from fruits and such. I also try to balance low fat with low carb. You MUST drink lots of water...at least 8 8 oz. glasses a day, but the no calorie sweetners are wonderful to help that. Try to switch to skim milk if you have not done so already. Promise butter is a great choice, and get some cooking sprays. Try to cut out all soda, even diet. I eat spinach instead of lettuce for my salads because it has much more nutritional value. Try new things, my favorite source of protein right now is tilapia. Mustard has no calories, no fat, and no carbs...use it to dip your salad in sometimes instead of dressing. <br>  <br>  You are supposed to go off the diet every 13th and 14th day. While ON the diet, stay away from refined sugars and white potatoes, white bread, white pastas, and such.<br>  <br>  EXCERCISE:<br>  I was pretty out of shape, so I've built up on excercise slowly and do things I like. I work from 4:30 til 1 in the morning so I get my lunch around 8:30. I eat my meals on my breaks and walk during my lunch outside. The terrain isn't level, I have some hills, and it's beautiful outside right now. I walk about half an hour at least 3 times a week. I hike every Sunday with my fiance. During that day, we are less concerned about excercise and pace, and more concerned about enjoying the outside. We walk sooo much longer that way. I also am going to be swimming when it's warmer and adding tennis and pilates.<br>  <br>  The important thing about excercise to remember is that you need to find something you enjoy and not something you view as a chore. You are more likely to stick with it that way. AND adding any extra activity will help...simply parking your car further away or taking the stairs. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! If you would like to talk more specifically about things, you can feel free to email me. :)<br>  <br>  Tonya<br>  tonya1@hotmail.com

It has no etiology, though some believe it is related to an inability to reach stage 4 non-REM sleep (when the body repairs itself of daily wear-and-tear).<br>  <br>  It can lead to chronic fatigue or be caused by chronic fatigue, so in that sense it is progressive but I do not believe it is generally placed in that category.
vklLb7IGaa	It is not possible to spot reduce fat in just one part of your body, like your stomach. In order to lose stomach fat you will need to lose the fat all over your body.<br>  <br>  In short you may need to start:<br>  <br>  1) Eating healthier, this means:<br>  <br>  Eat smaller meals<br>  Eat more meals a day<br>  Don’t starve yourself<br>  Eat more vegetables and fruit<br>  Drinks more water<br>  Less sugars and empty calories (less soft drinks, cakes, cookies)<br>  Switch to whole wheat versions of your bread and pasta, brown rice instead of white rice<br>  <br>  2) Exercising:<br>  <br>  Forget crunches, crunches work your ab muscles but they dont burn enough calories to lose belly fat, if you do hundreds of crunches daily you will have great abs but you wont see them under your belly fat.<br>  Prefer full body exercises they burn the most calories and increase you metabolism for a few hours after your workout.<br>  Get a training partner or a fitness trainer, a very worthwhile investment - of the money you save on junk food for example =)<br>  <br>  Try also to reduce stress and get enough sleep.

WHNvnq0Jaa	Losing weight and bulking up are two very different things -- in fact they are opposites.  This means you can't do both at the same time.  You need to focus on either fat-loss or gaining muscle mass.  If you want to lose lots of weight, you need to change your diet to promote fat-loss.  If you want to gain muscle, you need to also change your diet but in a different way.<br>  <br>  Fat-loss = Lots of dietary options.  Try cycling carbs..Try a 2:1 approach (2 high-carb days followed by 1 low-carb day).  <br>  <br>  Muscle gain = Workout at least 3 x a week and eat lots of healthy proteins and complex carbs.|`|3inOJA89aa	drink water and run around your house|`|tbodfwgcaa	Hallo,<br>  <br>  5' 6'' = 167Kg. is an equilibrium weight for an adult boy. If u want to loose ur weight , there is and one formula, that is;<br>  <br>  Burn the calaries more than that u consume.<br>  <br>  Means less eat (Fat) and more work (Physical excercises). Make a regular record of ur weight by using a weighing machine and a threadmil (better).|`|aOYfAHvUaa	be carefull loosing a lot of weight in 1 month is dangerous, the formula I know is simple. CARDIO - use a treadmill or bike for 30min or 45min per day. Watch your food, eat less carbs like cereal or breath, eat more tuna, chicken or meat only cooked on a oil free pan and plenty of veggies. this is a healthy diet and a good way to start if you want to loose weight, if someone tells you can loose a lot of weight fast is dangerous with a good diet and your age you will see the results, be patient think of how much time your body was exposed to bad food habits or lack of excercise, you can make moderated workout with weights after 2 weaks of cardio. Then you can do CARDIO and then WORKOUT with weights, do not over do it!! you can hurt yourself.|`|z6kWaMe0aa	Walk... a lot. If you have the time to walk 10-15-20 miles a day, do it. If you want to gain muscle mass, lift weights, do pushups, situps, etc. And if you're looking to lower your mile times, start running 2 miles a day, 4-5 days a week, give yourself a few days off, but never more than 2 days in a row. Once you get your body used to running 2 miles, the mile run will feel like a walk in the park.<br>  <br>  As far as diet, cut out sugars completely. I've also read a lot of evidence that carbs are really the only thing that allows your body to store fat, so if you want to lose some weight, limit your carbs. Be sure that you're drinking plenty of water and that you're getting enough protein, minerals and vitamins.<br>  <br>  You don't have to over do it, but if you can stick to it for 30 days, you'll really see decent results. Good luck!|`|wn9koxvPaa	running/cardio.|`|VaFH2AY6aa	Just a mile? C'mon... Everyday for P.E. we ran three miles.|`|P3cF75KQaa	I understand where you're coming from youngster. I always dreaded the mile run in high school myself. There is only one way to lose weight, you have to create a calorie deficit each day. That means that by the end of each day, you need to have burned more calories than you consumed. With the information you've given, height, weight, and age, an accurate estimation of how many calories you burn each day can be given. Basically, 3000 calories equals one pound. So, if you create a 500 calorie deficit each day (which won't be that hard if you're serious about it) you would burn a small bit more than a pound a week. If you really want to go hardcore and lose 2 pounds a week, a 900 deficit per day would do it. It's hard, definitely, but doable.  I would recommend you visit this website, it goes very in depth and will tell you everything you need to know. It will probably take 15-20 minutes to read but i'd advise you not to skip anything, and i'm sure you won't if you are serious about wanting to lose weight.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theloseweightdiet.com/lose-weight1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theloseweightdiet.com/lose-we...</a>|`|GUVl3KiYaa	you wanna go at it in a month? why don't you decide to do the better thing and do it for life? You WILL be happier. Why don't you do what will make you happy?<br>  <br>  Solution: do cardio on your off days for a minimum of 30 mins per day. I would say run, but swimming would be best. If you don't own an olympic size pool or your school doesn't have one, go get your butt out there and run. Don't expect that you can jsut do it if you try hard enough. It's going to be rough. You better mentally prepare for the pain and push through it when it comes. The pain isn't going to go away either so just be ready for it. I recommend cacrdio 4 days a week.<br>  <br>  The other days, figure out what muscle groups you want to build and do it. Eat more protein and drink a lot of water. Stop eating stuff you don't need. Stop eating potato chips. Stop drinking soda. If man made it, don't eat it. If you can't pull it out of the ground, don't eat it. If you can't pull it out of an animal, don't eat it. If you can't eat it 1000 years ago because it didn't exist. don't eat it now.|`|UNQssejEaa	you just got to run as much as possible... that and speed up your metabolism by eating small snacks throughout your day and a healthy lunch and dinner at night. drink tons of water (reccomended a gallon a day) and do situps and pushups every morning and night (100 in the morning and 100 in the night)|`|286a824fde9062e4151bf1d1006af7ffaa	the first thing you gotta do is shut your mouth...<br>  you can eat anything you want, as long as you don′t eat too much... eat a bite of chocolate instead if the whole bar.<br>  do that, and change soda for light/zero and you′ll be on your way...<br>  exercise, obviously, is important... running burns way more fat than pulling weights.

GqEqFSdpaa	I'm a twin and my mother is a twin. We have had are conversations about having a connection with our twin and we both say no. Maybe it does happen, I can't say no it doesn't, I can only tell you what I have or have not experienced.<br>  <br>  Have you been thinking about your twin or the death of her? There is a thing called "survivors guilt". People get it when they are the only survivor in an accident, or tragic event. Maybe you kept this in the back of your mind all these years and it has surfaced.<br>  <br>  I would think this is really hard to handle and can empathize with you. My advice would be to talk to a doctor, one who is much more educated in this area. You know that you had no control over this, but it seems to still be effecting you in some way.  If you ever have a hard time around your Birthday or other events like that , I would think survivors guilt. I'm no doctor, just have read a lot. <br>  <br>  Anyway I hope you find peace with this. Try sharing your dreams with your family, maybe you can get closure on this.<br>  <br>  Take care and don't give up!|`|b50997030128762f2fbbbd4d2554f0adaa	twins share connectionections.  even ppl who were never told that they had a twin and they died or were separated at birth feel like there is something missing in their lives but just cant identify it.   i dont know what your dreams mean but you can tell a doctor.  it must be scary having dreams about things that never happened.  maybe subconciously u r thnking that it was your twin that should have lived and not you<br>  <br>  this isnt serious but talk to someone...maybe with a frend or parent or therapist you will stop having these dreams|`|0d8ced59212a7d77617d180ef03e1b32aa	I have a twin and I believe there is a connection. I don't know how old you are but our connection didn't last. It didn't help either that I imagined myself closing the door on him and keeping it locked. I would stay away from doctors and such and try something alternative maybe. Maybe some kind of meditation can help you to "shut the door" on this connection. I also would like to know how long these dreams have been going on. Did it start after your parents told you what happened? Maybe subconsciously  you feel responsible.
24RXxENHaa	well would you want to have to do a pushup every 14.4 minutes. or have to wake up when sleeping every 14.4 minutes. i think you would get more exercise doing 100 at once anyway because after a couple you have to wrok even harder and thats what builds up muscle. doing 1 pushup alone doesnt do anything.|`|2V9XjSw3aa	Doing repeatly like 100 at a time won't give your muscles a break and the harder you push your muscles the bigger they will grow.|`|ndALeUbcaa	I think it's more about endurance. <br>  If you push yourself to do 100 at once, your muscles are working harder, so they build up stronger.|`|b1slTYBbaa	If you do a pushup every 14.4 minutes people will put you in an insane asylum.

Keep trying to do this every day, not during an attack. It can be an escape for you and over time it may help. <br>  Have you seen anyone for this?? there are medications that you can take daily to try to help, or the are meds you only take when you need them, the problem with the later is they are addictive. Though taking medication is not pleasant and they do have side effects such as sleepiness or weight gain, sometimes for a while it is necessary and the benefits outweigh the rest. You are a very fortunate person to have a bf that cares so much, may God bless him, and you too because it is hard, i have a family member who has this problem. <br>  Like you mentioned before when this is going on cutting or hurting yourself--you can't feel it at the time, that can possibly cause more problems like infection or stitches. Perhaps if you talk to a therapist they can help you with coping skills that will help you avoid medications.

In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind.

There is not one cause but something will set u off mine is leaving the house and the thought of not getting the toilet on time. Very common one infact. You need to find wot cause them and face that fear or if can aviod it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|tDyuxpVcaa	I have had them too and I hate them. The thing that helped me most is medication. Try to talk to your doctor. If he does not help, go to another one. Some of us have more anxiety and are more likely to have them. Other times, a traumatic event has caused them, like being mentally abused. Try to talk to someone who is understanding about things that upset you. Counseling can really help a lot. Having friends to talk to also helps. Just being able to share day to day things with others can help with stress. I hope you feel better soon.

First, you need to make sure what kind of protein shake you bought.  Nowadays, there a lot protein shakes that have low carbohydrates, which makes it lower in calories.  If you goal is to gain muscle mass I would recommend finding a little more calories than most.  Dymatize, EAS, Muscle-tech, and Muscle-Milk are great brands to look at.  You don't really need a pre workout shake, eating a meal 30-40 minutes before working out will serve better.  After your workout, if taking creatine take the creatine within 10 minutes of finishing, than 10-15 minutes later drink your protein shake.  This is allows more absorbtion into the muscle cells to help with recovery.|`|9QEgNT2Faa	I do it before. Its great to already have it in your system to help build muscle mass.

The anti-supplement camp says that a person can get all of the nutrients they need by eating a variety of healthy foods in the right proportions. They suggest eating at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day along with enough dairy products, lean protein and whole grains. In their minds the supplement manufacturers are just out to get your money. <br>  <br>  The pro-supplement camp, however, says that the produce that is available today is being grown in soil that is increasingly depleted due to over-cultivation and lack of proper rotation techniques and contains far less vitamins and nutrients than it did back in the old days. They claim that you would have to eat way too much food and consume far too many calories to meet your nutrient requirements. I tend to agree and would suggest a good multi-vitamin to most people.<br>  <br>  You should seek a vitamin without iron, however, because the ferrous sulfate they use as an iron supplement is difficult to assimilate in the body (especially when taken at the same time as calcium) and adequate iron can be consumed through small portions of lean red meat and green leafy vegetables.<br>  <br>  When it comes to all the supplements for weight lifters, there is just as much debate. While some of these supplements have been proven to improve gains slightly, I am not sure the benefits outweigh the costs for most of these types of supplements. Other than maybe taking an amino-acid supplement post workout (a good whey protein shake will have all the amino-acids you need for proper recovery), I would suggest saving your hard earned money for more important thi|`|KCaWem1jaa	both, but the more important shake is the one after your workout , drink it within 15-20 mins after you are done, before your workout drink it 30-40 mins and 5-10 mins before eat pop-tarts, thats an old bodybuilding secret. |`|MhnVaGxwaa	after to help build muscle.<br>  <br>  answer mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Apl3walMZZ40uhm9AyDoX.Xsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081004123645AALlS96">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|r44uG1pnaa	I take it 15 mintues after I lift, thats what my trainer told me to do.

If I skip a few days or sit too long, wham, the pain returns. But I can instantly get rid of it.<br>  <br>  The key is finding "which" exercises that pinpoint and stretches the area that is stiff and everyone's area of pain is different.<br>  <br>  Depending upon what is causing your back pain, it may only be  controlled and not totally eliminated.

But now its back and looks just about the same as last time.

AubmEoYgaa	Resting it is the best treatment, but if you must walk, get yourself a knee support. You probably over worked your legs and have a tender ligament right now. Sometimes when you are at home and got some free time, try using some moist heat. Take a towel and soak it with hot water, ring it out then wrap it around the knee. Do this several times, then afterward, rub some Aspercreme all over and around the knee to see if that helps. But just plain resting it will do it more good than anything. The moist heat helps a lot, so maybe doing both together, resting and moist heat will help it heal quicker. Make sure you have a good pair of walking shoes and wear a support brace when out.

This is okay as your body will be trying to digest it and it'll soften somewhat making it easier when the time comes. <br>  When you feel like you need to move your bowels you should go to the bathroom and take a book or computer game and stay there perhaps at least 10 minutes and don't try too hard to push it out. Your anus will gradually start to relax while sitting there and it'll slowly start to dilate and the cucumber should be slowly pushed out. If it doesn't work the first time just keep doing the same thing each time you feel you need to use the bathroon. Relaxing the anus and giving it time while sitting there is the key to success. <br>  <br>  Thank God you're not kinky for pineapple! <br>  Have you learned anything from this?|`|C2Puv2iSaa	GO TO THE E.R.|`|fGA3OCAwaa	Get your Girlfriend  to fist you & get it out that way|`|3NUbXSCBaa	wtf the ER duh|`|93m0cD3aaa	You'd be a real shmuck not to go to the E.R.... |`|7cjn2u9uaa	You have a cucumber up your butt and you are sitting there typing on the computer? are you fooling around with this guy?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap7r0zNGl2BD9J88oPjCkFzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081022195303AAcGDtI&show=7#profile-info-LSKCbQemaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XpFy9zeVaa	Get to the ER...don't mess with it at home. <br>  You'll be surprised that the ER would not be shocked<br>  because this is more common than you think.    |`|v1YNzX8yaa	Wow.....a half hour ago you said that your girlfriend wouldn't have sex with you because of your 13 inch penis.

lbknqERwaa	I am in the exact same boat with you!!!!!! I have smoked for about 15 years and have wanted to quit for awhile now. I was always afraid that the craving would never go away until yesterday I figured I would never know if I never tried I have tried to do the cold turkey thing a few times but I end up so grumpy and feel like it is more fair to smoke myself to death than to make my kids deal with the Nicotine monster that comes out every time I try to quit. So yesterday I went and bought the generic walgreen's brand patch and I have got to say I am suprised at how much easier the cravings are to deal with are. I still get them but I am trying to replace the bad habit with a good one so I drink a glass of water and try to distract myself with something else and the craving goes away. I have been smoke free for 24 hours now and I have got to admit that it really doesn't even bother me when my husband smokes. Although he feels bad smoking in front of me. (hopefully he will quit later too) I have so much more free time now and I am thinking about the extra money I will have later down the line.|`|WPVblANgaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  I had seen a guy mentioning a site <a href="http://healthexercisepro.com/" rel="nofollow">http://healthexercisepro.com/</a><br>  <br>  I also went there and the site has got some very nice articles. I really liked the site. I think all the guys who want to quit smoking should have peep in there.

I still crave, and even dream about it. yeah....<br>  But I feel healthier, I am healthier,and Im so glad I quit. I hated lugging around a pack of cigarettes with me whereve I went. I couldnt go anyhere without it! <br>  You do have to really want to quit.  I had to stop going to bars because the urge was so overwhelming. It is hard but everyone has the willpower. Here is what I did:<br>  Before you quit, reduce the amount you smoke, to maybe 5 a day for  a week..then go cold turkey! <br>  1. find a hobby, since you arent fiddling with a cigarette, lighter, or pack, you willl need to find something to do with your hands, or time. Try walking, whenever you get the urge, or dancing, some sort of craft....somthing that fills your time ...<br>  2. find something to alleviate your hand to mouth habit....chew gum, carrot sticks...anything healthy<br>  3. drink tons of water to help flush out the toxins. You may even find you get more thirsty...I did. (nicotine is a deadly poision)<br>  4. personally, I went to the health food store and bought the herbal cigarettes and when I really ciouldnt stand it, I would smoke one. this happened for maybe 2 weeks, then by the end of the 2nd week or so, I would only have a few puffs of one and then the craving would subside. I also made my own herbal blend and rolled ...kind a nasty...but it subsided my urge for a real cigarette, and it made it so I did not use nicotine.<br>  5. the physical addiction only lasts 3 days, its the mental addiction that gets ya..<br>  Dont tell people you are quitting, the more youtalk about it the more you want to do it. <br>  maybe you could write the cancer society for posters or some sort of literature to enforce the negative health issues that smoking causes . put the poster on your refrigerator or something?<br>  Imagine all the strength you have for your son! :) Youcan do it! <br>  <br>  |`|1jSaDOGlaa	try those niggorete gum things+diet &exercise |`|svfveDoKaa	My father in law smoked for fifty years, and he had to quit for health reasons. He tried everything, pills, the patch and nothing seemed to work. So he quit cold turkey, and what he did that actually helped him through his cravings is (this is going to sound funny but it worked for him) he bought and kept a bunch of those little cases of tic tacs. He would carry them around in his shirt pocket where he use to keep his cigarettes when he had a craving he would pull it out and tap one or two in his hand and suck on them. He did that for a little over a year, and now he doesn't have to use the tic tacs hardly, but he has not smoked for a little over a year, and for someone who has smoked for 50 years, I figured he would relapse, and he hasn't.|`|CaYqShmgaa	I've tried the same things you   mentioned and I'm in the process.

Yea I quit and I can tell you that the more trouble you have quiting the better you will stay quit because you will remember just how hard it was. If you want a good reason to quit I can give you several. My good friend and next door neighbor was a heavy smoker and died of a massive heart attack. Another good friend of mine was a moderate smoker and died of a massive heart attack. My son-in-law was  a moderate smoker and died of a massive heart attack. My other son-in-law's father was a moderate smoker and died of a heart attack (he lasted 1 days after the attack) My sister in law's husband was a moderate smoker and died of a massive heart attack. Her second husband didn't smoke but ate cigars, litteraly, and died of a massive heart attack while being opperated on for a brain tumor. Yea, that will make you quit.|`|bbcZJXGkaa	I heavily smoked for 10 years.  I read a book called "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking" By Allen Carr.  I swear to God that it saved my life.  I quit while reading the book.  Best of luck to you.  It is available on Amazon for $15.  If it doesn't work you only spent 3 packs of cigarettes on it.  DO NOT get Chantix.  It is a horrible medication that shouldn't have left the clinical trial stages of testing.  It causes: sleep disturbances, suicidal/homicidal ideations, depression, hallucination, pulmonary embolism, blood clot disorders and death.|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	Most of the cravings do go away, but only gradually -- it can take as much as a year and a half to feel fully normal, though in my experience anyone they're manageable by five or six months out.<br>  <br>  Anyway, go to your doctor and get a prescription for Chantix. It's much more effective than earlier stop smoking meds.|`|AA10065077	I personally have never smoked, but I have helped people quit smoking. First, I tell them to tell their friends and family what they are planning on doing and inform them of the date. Second, as the date draws near buy less cigarettes and buy either gum or patches and have a straw or an empty hollow pen. Third, no more cigarettes use the patches or gum the straw or empty hollow pen is so you can hold it like a cigarette and use it as such but don't light it. Slowly decrease the use of the gum or patches. Places you would smoke at you might want to stay away from for awhile. I've been told the craving never really goes away, but there are ways to deal with it like focusing on something else. Also your doctor might be able to help a lot of times anti depressants help. Good luck.|`|Tliy9Dduaa	I HAD REALLY BAD PNEUMONIA i was in the hospital for  11 days <br>  prior to that i smoked weed and cigarettes for 25 yrs <br>  it contributed to my pneumonia they had to cut me open and scoop the fluid out of my lungs i was in intensive care for 4 days its been almost 5 yrs and i haven't smoked anything since. i guess near death will help <br>   I HOPE U DON'T GO THROUGH WHAT I DID <br>   THEY SCOOPED OUT 2 LITERS YES A LARGE PEPSI BOTTLE FULL OF FLUID OUT OF MY LUNGS THEY SAID IT WAS LIKE ORANGE MARMALADE.GOOD LUCK MISS KEFLO <br>  SORRY FOR THE GRAPHIC WORDS BUT DO WHAT U CAN TO QUIT IT'S NOT GOOD. <br>  E-MAIL ME IF U NEED A BUDDY TO TALK TO IF U WANNA QUIT <br>  <br>  I FEEL BETTER AND I AM MORE HEALTHY<br>  GOOD LUCK AND E-MAIL IF U WANT TO QUIT AND IT DOES TAKE A WHILE BUT THE CRAVINGS DO GO AWAY BUT BE STRONG  IT IS VERY TOUGH I HAVE WANTED TO SMOKE MANY TIMES BUT ALL I NEED TO DO IS  THINK OF THE TUBES STICKING OUT OF MY BODY NO FUN AT ALL <br>

01c5e380e9f54fb8317a10c46597385baa	No and Yes answer. No, its not a smart way to workout. They put you on a circuit type training, good, but its all on machines, bad. Machines inherently put the motions that you go through in a direct line, which is not how the body naturally moves weight. You are better off doing the majority of your weightlifting with free weights and cables.<br>  <br>  BUT, if having those three sessions a week in your schedule makes you go every week three times a week, its not a bad thing. Better to do something rather than nothing.<br>  <br>  I'd say you would be better off going to a regular gym and hiring a trainer to be better but chances are you would go somewhere like 24 hour fitness and would be put on a similar circuit by the usual crappy trainers they employ. They are, and this is a huge generalization, barely certified. And even then by something like the ACE. Kind of the bottom feeders of the certificated trainers. Not horrible, but nowhere near the best.<br>  <br>  Find a gym or a trainer that is certified by the NSCA. They are the leader in the industry. They will probably be a bit more expensive but you will get a workout that is specifically targeted to your goals and once you begin paying, you won't skip the sessions because you won't want to throw your money away. Which will end up being an extra reason to go to the gym.<br>  <br>  |`|4fb940b618b02166724f887b346314c6aa	A friend of mine used Curves for a year. She said it was great for her because even though she was really out of shape at the beginning, she could exercise at her own level. She switched gyms after she got stronger and was ready for something more rigorous. You use each piece of equipment for a few minutes, then move on to the next, going around a circle of machines.<br>  <br>  You will only stay at it if your Curves location is convenient for you. Also, you should visit at the times you're most likely to work out, because it's busier at some times of day.<br>  |`|AA11289758	While I haven't personally gone (I use 24 hour fitness), I have known women who go to Curves.<br>  <br>  I have heard that Curves is a fun and positive environment, and that they have a good variety of classes.  Part of the attraction for them is the support given and shared between women.<br>  <br>  No matter where you go, there will be nice people and rude people, so ignore anyone who is nasty toward you, and gravitate towards the positive people.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

I am unsure what could be wrong or why you have this pain... but maybe try some different positions.  It is possible that the position you are using (even if it is a normal one) is pressing against something inside and hurting you.  So, try a few different things to see if this relieves some of the pain.  If it continues, I would get copies of my records from the obgyn and get a second consult.  Something is not right if you are in constant pain... and if this doctor can not find, it you may need another one.  However, again, try some different positions to see if this relieves the pain.

We women come in all shapes and sizes so don't worry about it. Besides when you have kids your chest will expand.|`|NWx4vZiJaa	naw b, there are chicks with SMALL boobs. like so small. and damn your tall:) baha, but dont worry, most guys look at the *** anyways. |`|AA11248201	its fine, trust me, i'm a 34 AA, 5' 10" and weigh 145 lbs, ur good 
AA12316174	I think it is only you! I think you may have just been a PITA patient. 1st you go in telling them how things need to be done without keeping an ear open for their expert advice after all this is what they deal with on a regular basis. telling them you have endometriosis and this is the way to treat it and due to that you must skip periods even after they advised you, you should allow your body to have a period or two you shut them out and didn't hear their explanation about how you are over dosing your body with hormones and the day you do have complications due to overdosing in hormones you cant blame them BUT your previous DR for that. 2nd of all questioning their charting. The point got across regardless of how they choose to word it. That is their job. You cant go into a surgery and tell the surgeon how they should do t heir job just because you feel your technique is better. As long as it gets done is all that matters. Then flipping out about the fee to get a copy of your records! Did you know the information on the paper belongs to you BUT the paper it is written on belongs to the facility. They are not denying you access to your records but charging you a minimal fee for their paper and time taken out of their day to copy your chart.<br>  <br>  Previously you stated you only had 1 sexual partner so how are you so sure it was this sexual assault? They do know the incubation period of a specific disease and maybe just maybe that is why they dont believe you. Or maybe the fact you claim you contracted it due to being "fingered" which is highly unlikely. If you choose to do peels (which the specific one you claim you had done in office is generally done at home) Lets say yes they did do them in office. If it was not explained to you the possible side effects (which I doubt) a hand out was given to you to read and you were asked to sign a paper stating you understand the side effects and you signed it accepting the possibilities.<br>  would you rather deal with a deformed labia OR having genital warts? (which by the way NO treatment can garantee them being gone for ever) Would you rather explain to a man that you have genital warts or that your genitals are deformed?<br>  <br>  Just becuase they are state funded does not mean they are cheaper they are allowed to bill you whats usual and customary for your region. IF you qualify for discounted services you may get discounted services but it sounds like you dont and YES payment is expected at time of service. The website tells you that, when you call to schedule and appointment yo are told that and when you walk in its posted near the window that payment is expected at time of service. They actually do carry name brand and generic pills. The quality of a pill does not make you sick rather the combination of the hormones in the pills. and I also pay $22 a pack at planned parenthood and my local pharmacy was charging me $65 for that exact same pill<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT************<br>  Note you attack me for being unprofessional but take 1 min & put your self in the shoes of this clinitian. Can you Imagine your infront of a judge (being you are going to law school) and the person you are defending is telling how to do your job and not allowing your opinions to be heard. I think you would drop their case. Im not saying the clinician is right for being rude (if this even is a true case scenerio)however  I completly understand her/him being upset however I would have walked away from you and asked someone else to assist you. But as long as you sign the paper work they have done their job covering their behind.<br>  <br>  So go an explain how under this account you have this scenerio and also you are pregnant 15 yr old getting an abortion AND you are wondering what it is like to get pap at planned parenthood? Very conflicting yet you attack me and dont adress that issue!<br>  <br>  Some advice if you want to have people turned off my planned parenthood or what to stir up some controversy on here keep your accounts straight and your story. Even though your questions are private when you advance serach planned parenthood 15 questions show up and 10 of them belong to you under all three accounts which are carbon copy questions OR contradicting questions your name still shows up and even if you change your screen name it changes on ALL your questions!|`|gmIlj1qzaa	I'm really sorry you had to go through that.<br>  <br>  I didn't like planned parenthood.  I learned now to go through my doctor.  I just went there for birth control and the dose, or I don't know what you call it, was too high or something.  The pills, when I first started taking them, made my cramps worsen be 1000, and made me horrible nasueated and throw up.  They also made me have terrible mood swings.  Ugh.  I just use condoms now.|`|ADilKlOEaa	i am so sorry you went through that , i was raped but i didnt go through nothing like that, i have been at the health dept and the lady cussed me because i was pregnant, you can call the main office and speak to a supervisor tell them how rude the person was and that person will get in trouble. no one deserves to be treated like that. that is their job to help people. i hope everything goes alright with you in your life good luck!!!|`|NWx4vZiJaa	they were really nice whwn i went, but it wasnt for an STD, it was birth control, but they were relly nice, and made me feel better, and not scared.

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, this could be as a result of an entrapped or even pinched nerve (both examples only).<br>  <br>  However because of how long this has been going on for (from what I am understanding of the situation) I would recommend calling the doctor on Mon to see what they say.
g09JAF5oaa	you can go to Lenscrafters they can usually make glasses in about an hour.  Any optical with an onsite lab can do this.  Usually the chain store opticals, Lenscrafters, Visionworks etc.  If your prescription is normal it can be done in about an hour.  If you have some unusual prescription it may need to be sent out and take longer.  Call them first they'll tell  you if they can do it in a day.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	No matter what, it will take a maximum of 1-2 weeks. Because they need to fit the lenses on the glasses frame.

iEVEfPaVaa	I believe it is due to the position your head is in in relation to your sinuses.  The thick drainage comes from your sinuses. If you lay in some positions it enables the sinus drainage to drain into the other side of your nose.  When you are up and about there is probably a difference in how well alligned your two 'nares' (the cavities in each side of the nose) are in relationship to your sinuses or if there might be a slight obstruction in one side making it easiest to drain to only one side.  This is especially likely to be a problem if your septum (the tissue and cartilage between the two sides of your nose) is not straight (deviated septum)  I had this problem too before I had my nose fixed from a childhood break of my nose.  Now it's pretty good.  You are right, it is very annoying.|`|dNGbZQx4aa	OMG yes its wayyyy annoying!!!

If she actually wants to quit, encourage her to see a doctor about it.|`|dog1vQNBaa	Definitely you are doing a good job as you are concerned about your MOM's health. What you can do is first tell her that she has to quit it for you. Prepare her mentally, so that she listens to what you say and follow, Then you can try something that helps in quitting smoking. Some chwing gum helped my friend to quit this habit. they are helpful as Chewing Gum can create very good impact. Hope this will help you and your mom in giving up smoking.
Xwtf4iqjaa	isnt it kinda hard to fall asleep wen ur hungry?|`|iEVEfPaVaa	If you have a Hiatal Hernia with Reflux you should not eat in the 2 hours before you go to bed.  Most people don't have this.  Otherwise it is safe except your stomach needs rest too and it will not get rest until the food is digested.  However, being hungry can interfere with getting to sleep.  So use your best judgment and keep the snack light and small for best results.  Recent studies indicate that eating late at night will result in weight gain more so than food eaten when you are still awake and at least a little active.|`|ml2FDYECaa	I try not to eat after nine, but if you are hungry feed your stomach.

I remember having to carry my school books in front of my crotch sometimes just to move from classroom to classroom.|`|47l1Sumeaa	Hormones, being sexually aroused.|`|jnuBYMAiaa	Because you're a late bloomer, your body is still developing and maturing and due to this fact, your hormones are all out of balance to make this developing possible. Whenever your hormones are imbalanced to a certain degree, bodily reactions like random erections, sudden feelings of arousing happen. Usually it's just a phase until you're developed and will go away on it's own. Knowing that you have random erections, wear clothes that will allow the erection to be less noticeable when it occurs. Hope this helps.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	Most high schoolers get them by randomly paging through Playboy. Heh.|`|OVtUnuYnaa	puberty|`|6GEEwjwzaa	just the hormones|`|IBshj7fDaa	alot of times it could just be because your pants are rubbing it. or you were thinking about something that turned you on. theres another thing called "morning wood" where you basically get an erection in the morning. google it. but yeah its natural for men to get random erections. dont worry. its just a part of puberty.|`|N8DFsZB5aa	probs just "morning glory" ( where you are stiff when you wake up) or the vibrations from the vechle you drive turn you on.|`|TJl70Y6baa	haha
Isy85jB7aa	I find this question a bit intriguing because I don't think I would have ever thought of it myself.  ;)<br>  <br>  While it's true there may be a bit of an oder issue, one thing to keep in mind is that the body is constantly renewing itself.  Predominately when we wash we are washing and cleaning the skin but, the surface of our skin is basically composed of dead cells while new cells are being created below the surface and constantly being pushed upward until they eventually flake off (so neat little microbes can feast upon them).  <br>  <br>  So, short of a tattoo, if we get a mark on our skin somewhere and never wash it off, eventually it will "go away" because the skin that was marked upon is replaced.  <br>  <br>  There have actually been studies done with radioactive isotopes which show that every cell in the human body is replaced every 18 months or so.  Some cells, like the lining of our stomach, are replaced every week or so.  <br>  <br>  If we are to assume that taking a bath involves the use of soap then I would have to conclude that the human body would survive just fine because throughout the majority of human history, soap was not manufactured or even available for widespread usage.  <br>  <br>  From what I learned in my organic chemistry class the origins of soap were gleaned from women noticing their clothes becoming cleaner when they were washed downstream from human sacrifices - the movie Fight Club alludes to this when they mention the best fat for making soap comes from humans   ;)|`|LZmLBoBEaa	there are many diseases you can get infected with...<br>  <br>  and smelling bad is a disadvantage too.|`|eOJgctVWaa	NO social life. <br>  At all.<br>  Seriously.<br>  And since "man is a social animal", the end would be death.<br>  Um..

There are also secondary causes from other conditions such as pregnancy and kidney disease.  There is another contributor which can be a fooler.

They finally realized that they had to do a "dummy" read, wait and repeat the test to catch him a bit more relaxed.<br>  <br>  As many as 1 in 4 adults have high blood pressure.  Because there aren't many noticable symptoms, many people don't even realize that they do have high blood pressure.<br>  <br>  From emedicine:  "Blood pressure is measured with a blood pressure cuff and recorded as two numbers,such as 120/80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury).<br>  The top, larger number is called the systolic pressure. This is the pressure generated when the heart contracts (pumps). It reflects the pressure of the blood against arterial walls. <br>  The bottom, smaller number is called the diastolic pressure. This reflects the pressure in the arteries while the heart is filling and resting between heartbeats. <br>  Scientists have determined a normal range for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after examining the blood pressure of many people."<br>  Note: the normal range may vary.  About 95% of people fall within the normal range.  The remaining 5% are at risk.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

AA12358000	Terri L,<br>  In most cases, a negative stress test means that there is no underlying heart problem present, or at least nothing serious. However, for this negative result to be meaningful, it is important that the person exercises strongly, to the point where the heart rate and blood pressure rise. So, particularly in the case where the cause of chest pain is being evaluated, a negative stress test result is most reassuring following a good exercise performance. A negative result can also occur in a person with known heart disease, for example, following an old or even recent heart attack. Even if one artery is blocked, the others may be good, and sometimes even new channels form to bring blood and oxygen to previously diseased areas of the heart. These new channels are sometimes called "nature's bypass." In these situations, the person undergoing the stress test will have a negative result, with no symptoms or abnormalities on the ECG. This is a good result. These patients do not usually require further evaluation with an angiogram. In other situations, such as following a surgical procedure or after completing a healthy heart program, a negative result on the stress test provides objective proof to both the patient and doctor that the procedure or program has been beneficial.<br>  With regard to the positive EKG, you do not give any statement as to the reason for this test. If you have not had a myocardial infarction or any significant problem with your heart, the “positive” result may be that most likely the EKG wires were placed too high on your chest, which will make anyone appear to have had a previous myocardial infarction. However, without more detail of your results, it is impossible to even make a guess at the reason. It may be a positive or a false positive. You would be advised to discuss the matter with your doctor or examining medical professional who may be able to peruse the result of the examination.<br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

Although these episodes may appear random, they are a subset of an evolutionary response commonly referred to as fight or flight that occur out of context. This response floods the body with hormones, particularly epinephrine (adrenaline), that aid in defending itself from harm.<br>  <br>  Causes can be anything from a biological disorder to heredity. Certain phobias can also trigger attacks. Side effects from medication can also trigger attacks.|`|gmaCvh00aa	My therapist explained it to me this way:  Think of a tea kettle. You put the water in the kettle and as it gets hot, the water vapor expands and the steam HAS to find somewhere to go, so then it whistles.<br>  <br>  It might not be one thing, but a build-up of things, and then you have to blow off the steam and you have an anxiety attack.  Try to realize it is an anxiety attack.  That in itself (saying, "oh I am having an anxiety attack") often helps lessen the attack, as does minimizing it ("oh, it's JUST an anxiety attack, it will pass.")<br>  <br>  A panic attack is different from an anxiety attack--more intense and you think you are going to die right then and there.|`|9l0gn2sRaa	stress|`|AA10065077	stress|`|ejo4ezX8aa	stress
GBKaftrJaa	That's a very tricky one.  I've known people like that and never had the courage to tell them. I did find out one co worker had no sense of smell, and that explained a lot.<br>  <br>  But if she's your friend, I'd just make sure you are some place alone, where she won't be embarrassed by anyone else over hearing, and raise it in the most gentle way with lots of other genuine compliments mixed in with the bad.  Some people just can't smell themselves, so that could be the problem. I would assure her you are only saying this because you care about her and want to be a friend to her and that you figure it would sound better coming from someone who cares about her than a stranger on the street.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope she is a person who can take constructive criticism, because that's all it is, telling her how she can do something better.|`|mBHQEzd1aa	A gift of soap and deodorant might be a good start.|`|ebBGox2Maa	Just tell her that she needs a bath. Or you could buy her some cheap bath soap and some lotion and tell her that you mom brought you two of them and she can have the extra one. Ask her the next day did she use it and how did she like it. That way you can find out if she used it or not. Maybe she takes baths but has a body odor problem|`|CmgZpSVhaa	well people are used to their smell so they dont know so give her deoderants, soaps, perfumes, lotions, anything. and if you cant be honest about it then say oh i have this great perfume you should try...oh smell this soap doesnt it smell so good? ya know, stuff like that.|`|NzhtgOlJaa	Tell her, be brutally honest.

dqvZmj22aa	Sonds like a bit of both to me.  Evening primrose oil pills help the PMS, and maybe 1 cup of tea a day to wean yourself off a bit slower would be an idea.<br>  <br>  To quote:<br>  <br>  "Certain herbs have been evaluated for use in premenstrual syndrome. Many over-the-counter herbal preparations combine various herbs with certain vitamins to create a premenstrual syndrome formula. Although preliminary reports have been promising, more scientific research is needed to evaluate herbal treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Consult your health care provider before using any herbal supplement.<br>  <br>  Black cohosh: Black cohosh has been shown to positively impact the serotonin pathway and thus may have a beneficial impact for some women, especially those with vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Black cohosh does not affect estrogen levels or function.<br>  <br>  St. John's wort: This herb may help elevate serotonin levels, possibly helping premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Studies do not agree on its effectiveness. St. John's wort should never be used if you take prescription antidepressants.<br>  <br>  Evening primrose oil: Gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) is the active agent found in evening primrose oil. Much like mefenamic acid, GLA blocks prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in decreased breast tenderness, bloating, and weight gain. The standard dose is 3 grams per day, and it should be started less than 1 week before the onset of your period. This agent is available without a prescription at health food stores and certain pharmacies. A review of the studies on evening primrose oil, however, showed no proven effect on the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.<br>  <br>  Ginkgo biloba: Shown to reduce the symptom of breast pain, but not other premenstrual syndrome symptoms.<br>  <br>  Chasteberry (Vitex; agnus castus fruit extract): A study in 2001 evaluated the use of agnus castus fruit extract (20 mg per day) for 3 months. The treated group showed a greater improvement on all scales (irritability, mood alteration, anger, headache, breast fullness) except for bloating. Do not use if you take birth control pills"<br>  .|`|BRDqfAy3aa	Most probably PMS (read below about PMS and Caffeine)<br>  Pound for pound, tea has more caffeine than coffee, but you get 200 cups of tea per pound versus 50-60 cups of coffee per pound.

iRSWIUuYaa	if i was you, i wouldnt smoke. because everyone says they just wanna try it and then they end up being a life long smoker. and that i tell you is REALLY dangerous. each ciggarette has over 200 poisons in itt. and it seriously ruins your life, specially if your young. it slows down your respiratory system and it gives you a higher chance of a heart attack.<br>  peer pressure? i know how it feels. i hate it too. i've been through it and its pretty hard having all your friends smoking and you being the only one not smoking. and having everyone tell you to smoke and you denying it? even harderr. just stop being friends with them, or tell them that you dont really want to smoke. but if u do, and u want to ruin your life then go ahead. im not trying to stop you, im just giving you some advice... and also, if u still want to be friends with them but you dont wanna smoke, tell them. and tell them to not smoke around you when you guys hang out or something. because second hand smoke is bad too. around 3,000 people in USA die each year of second hand smoke. <br>  so now that i told you all that. really think about it, do u really want to ruin your life?

Think about it. If you started smoking not only will you ruin your lungs you'd ruin your life. Smoking causes many deaths of innocent people that just wanted to try it out. Don't try it just because your friends are doing it. Don't feel presured to do it because everyone else is doing it and they'll think your a loser if you don't smoke. If your really want help talk to someone who smokes and I bet they'll tell you it was the worst desicion they ever made in their life. Well there you have it I hope this helps.|`|1Y4WSQSSaa	Its not even lung cancer that is the worst. Living with COPD is actually in many opinion, a worse existence.

Track, dance, sports? <br>  <br>  Do you have allergies or have an asthma related history? Smoking could put you at risk for Respiratory arrest, which would send you to the Emergency Room.<br>  <br>  You know you dont want to smoke and be a slave to an ugly drug. Rebel against the sheeple. A drug, that depletes your body and skin of oxygen, causing advanced aging and increased risk of cancer.<br>  <br>  If this is not enough, find a believable excuse for your buddies, reasons why you can't start now or ever.

If you wanna smoke, at least smoke marijuana!(my opinion and plenty of facts to back it up that its safer than cigarettes) I know when I first saw Keira Knightly smoke I was like WOW she is hot and bad *** ha. But in all reality kids who smoke when they are young will more than likely have poor health when they are older. Even as kids they are un-athletic. Its just not worth it when you look at it.

AA11785060	You are fine, if not a bit below average on masturbation rates. Most guys your age are probably going solo daily on average.  Solo sex or masturbation is identical to sexual intercourse, substituting the hand instead of a vagina, but otherwise the same so no harm in it at all.

Everybody's different. As for the texture, more frequent orgasms will cause it to seem more 'watery' - only means that your body's production of sperm isn't quite keeping up with your masturbation frequency, so the ejaculate consists mostly of seminal fluid. As long as it isn't puslike (which would indicate a possible infection or other health concern) or it goes on for an extended period of time (which might mean some sort of hormonal or other problem interfring with sperm production), nothing to worry about.|`|coYlmdkWaa	Im 19 and have masturbated every day since I was 11-12 I used to masturbate a good few times a day lol.

I'm laughing at the coincidence. I HAVE THE SAME THING RIGHT NOW! IN THE OUTER CORNER OF MY LEFT EYE! THIS INSTANT, FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS! LOL. You have to admit, that's funny. I went to see the eye doctor, so I have the magic answer ;).<br>  It's a sty. if you pull the bottom lid down a bit on towards the outer corner and look, you'll most likely see it. The doctor gave me an ointment... Erythromycin Ophthalmic Ointment, but explained it's really just a way to speed things up because it's just a superficial infection. It'll start draining in a anywhere from a couple days to a week or so. To help with the swelling and speed up the draining without the meds he said to just put a warm moist rag over the eyes several times a day. Makeup and touching does help form sty. They are basically pimples in your eye (clogged pores). Don't rub so much with your fingers (use a cloth or something) and be sure to clean off your makeup thoroughly. Leaving makeup on overnight is a leading aider in the formation of sty.

But I don't understand why I'm breathless after going up 3 stairs, and my liver hurts....|`|STQuFtaYaa	yeah, some people exercise too much but i dont think thats much of a problem considering the obesity in the world

How unhealthy would depend on exactly what you eat, and what you aren't getting that your body needs.|`|GFHRpDE4aa	You can look healthy but you can have hidden health problems, me and my brother are that way we look very healthy, but we eat junk and we both have high blood pressure, and he has a six pack and i am just skinny, so doing this can make you have big complications in the future.<br>  EX:<br>  high blood pressure= heart attacks, in the long run.|`|AA12123894	No,Im sure you`ve heard the old saying"You are what you eat".If you eat junk,your body wont function as well.<br>  Just like a car,if you put cheap gas in it,it wont run as well and the engine will break down faster.<br>  How can you be healthy if you dont eat healthy?Junk food is called that for a reason.|`|KHI7MB4iaa	yes you can because when you exercise you burn off the calories you consume so you stay healthy :D|`|MUbx0sOXaa	yes,but your energy will wane quickly,you will not know how strong you could be and as you age you will speed up your cell deterioration.|`|GinweoOfaa	No, if your body doesn't get the right fuel it needs it will burn out. Example: Dad puts normal gasoline, actually premium, in whihc makes his car run great! He starts putting in next to nothing of watered down gas and his engine fails and the car DIES. You have to eat healthy if you want to be fit, eat eggs, they make you full and have only 2 percent fat.

(do not exceed 1440mg for a 4 year old in 24 hours, and 3900 for an adult, so somewhere between there is how I GUESSED 3000mg) if it is regular tylenol (325mg) than no more than 9 pills in 24 hours, if it is extra strength (500mg) no more than 6 pills in 24 hours.

At some point when I was a child and my teeth were forming, I had a fever which affected the enamel. The enamel is the protective coating and there were spots on several places in a few of my teeth that the coating didn't form. That made the tooth susceptible to decay|`|0mHi3S2Raa	as my dentist says, if you eat eventually you're teeth will need attention. sometimes you just get decay and theres nothing you can do about it, of course other then stop eating. lol|`|isLpxuiEaa	god knows<br>  I'm 16, and i have 9!!! cavities 9!!!! although i do smoke, i don't eat or drink much sugery food anymore<br>  and my teeth are constantly getting compliments from people, so they don't look awful, but looks can be decieveing<br>  i brush daily and use mouthwash<br>  just unlucky i suppose<br>  |`|eK9NTFUXaa	what kinda cavity u got ..??<br>  <br>  well ... in general ..

YwHl37Hgaa	Try lavender oil. Apply this oil on the back acne everyday for minimum 15 days or else apply fresh Aloe vera juice or the gel and wash after a few hours. When washing your back use a loofah, sponge or exfoliant to help remove any dead skin cells that may clog up pores. Use a gentle action and don’t be too harsh otherwise you will end up breaking the skin. You should probably change your shirt twice a day to avoid bacteria buildup.

DzRs5F0maa	my sister embraces it. When she was younger, the doctor told her that she would top out around 5-6. A few months ago, the same doctor told her that she wouldn't grow anymore, but she was 5-8. Since then, she has grown another inch and we're both waiting to see if she gets taller than me (5-10).

QP8LdPLeaa	um everyone feels like that when they start a job. you just have to give it time and get use to it. its foreign to you right now, but later on, it will be like nothing. at least you're not around those mean people anymore. that's one of the reasons why i left Wendy's. fast food jobs are just terrible, because it comes with hungry angry customers, stressed out rude co-workers who blame you for everything and make you feel like crap,  and then its standing on your feet all day serving heart attack food to customers who don't know how to say thank you. so now i'm a receptionist at a hospital. at first i was like "aww man i just really wanna quit! what am i doing here!! am i smart enough to do this work?" but i got over there, and now i'm loving it. i don't mind going to work!!! just give it time.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	that sucks i am sorry and i am sorry to hear your mom passed away my prays are with you and your family. i would write down pros and cons of the job and then really think what overcomes the other the pros or the cons and if it is more bad then good then look for another job but give it a little more time things can change and you might start to like your job. best of luck hun! :)|`|AA10426969	Keep your head up Josi, you're fighting the good fight! :)<br>  <br>  Plus, did you know that a change in job is one of the most stressful things a person can go through?

UjhYJHGIaa	Are you sleeping after your workout? Do you eat after you do exercise? Have you ever thought that the workout you have is to strengthen muscles. Two suggestions:<br>    1. The scale is broken<br>    2. Change your diet|`|XQJg3RNTaa	it seems to me that if that's all correct you just need to be pushing your workouts harder, I feel like death after each one of my runs, try increasing the intensity of your workouts. You should also start doing some swimming and lifting to take the stress off your legs and build some muscle mass. It sounds to me like you might be using an elliptical, I find it very very difficult to get a proficient workout using an elliptical, if you are using one you should switch to running.<br>  <br>  (just fyi, girls don't have enough testestorone in their systems to get bulky and muscle mass burns calories 24/7 even while you sleep so don't be afraid of the weight room!)|`|niZBsn9Qaa	THE SAAAAAAAAAME Thing happened to me.<br>  <br>  Ive been on a diet since after christmas. I go up and down like a yo yo. I lost 11 pounds in 2 weeks, then gained back 8, then down again like 3, then back up where i started, now im down 12 pounds. Finally after almost 2 months.<br>  <br>  its common that women sometimes gain weight before they start to lose it. Seriously. Your body needs to be taught how to change because its comfy where it is so it will compensate for lower calories with lower metabolism, or get used to the exercise. You have to be patient with it, its kinda like a big kid. Consistency is the key. My suggestion is increase your cardio exercise, only weigh once a week (i know the scale is addictive) because your weight can literally fluctuate up to 7 pounds in the same day (water and food LITERAL weight) and get a tape measure. Pay more attention to the tape measure than the scale. If you are going down in inches (which will take about 2 months to start seeing results) then ignore the scale. seriously. You will gain muscle before you lose fat. The more muscle you have, the faster you'll burn fat, so believe it or not THIS IS A GOOD THING. make sure to change your routine once a week (type of cardio, length, intensity, etc) so your body cant get used to it, and make sure you are eating at least 1500 calories a day. Trust me, its NOT too much. If you eat less, your metabolism will slow down and you'll gain it back if you start even eating 100 more a day.<br>  <br>  be patient, ive gone through the same heartaches and frustrations as you are so i know. but i'm just now starting to see results so keep at it, it will happen!!!!!!|`|uTKCjmKgaa	muscle weighs more than fat so if you are working out that hard then you may be losing fat but not weight because you are increaseing your muscle mass|`|CQbnVjUuaa	Quit eating so many friuts and look at lables.....Low sodium and no fat are a huge thing.Quit using butter if you do and switch to olive oil.Try and drink alot of water because your body needs to hydrate.Also an important thing in weight loss is when you are working out get your heart rate up and keep it up...a sure fat burner.Go to rosstraining.com and check the forums and articles,Ross enamait is a master...I was 280 and now weigh 185 because of a good work ethic and a nutrition plan.Don't diet just eat healthy and make sure to keep your metabolism sped up by eating small amounts 5-6 times a day..ALSO be patient the weight will not fall off overnight just keep it up.
eFW5O92Yaa	The reason it stopped after 10lb is because of the plateau effect. It's when you do the same routine consistently and your body adapts to it. You have to keep switching it up in some way to keep the progress going. I really don't see why you need tight jeans to skate though, the best skater in my school wears regular jeans....<br>  <br>  Anyways I can tell you now you're probably not going to get down to 120. At 5'8" and if your a growing kid, your body may lose another 20lb tops, and by then you'll be tall enough you look like a stick. Anyways what you might want to do is just use light weights with high reps n sets. Do squats, leg extentions and flexions, jogging (preferably with a hoody/sweats or in higher temperatures, calf raises.<br>  <br>  Then again I don't see how just skateboarding could gain much muscle mass in your legs, it would normally just tone it. To gain actual muscle mass it normally needs weights which normally means weightlifting. If there are no results after 2-4weeks of this routine chances are it's not going to drop off, which like you suggested, some bodies just work this way. If you were born to a larger family, it's pretty much impossible to slim down a lot however most people just build it into muscle.|`|7qTKREOmaa	Its hard to lose muscle unless you starve yourself, or like youo said just not use it. But that is unhealthy. Just focus on losing the weight, and having muscle will help you do that. Besides would you rather have weak, chicken legs, or strong musclular legs?
AA11550519	Maybe you're doing too much isolation work. Nothing beats compound movements for strength. Also, things like doing partial reps, holding the peak of the movement, doing it really slowly, or even just doing 8-12 reps are things bodybuilders do to increase the 'pump' i.e force liquid into the muscle. Strength comes from fibres, so more liquid makes it look bigger, but it's not stronger.<br>  <br>  Strength training involves 5-7 reps maximum, as fast as you can lift which isn't very fast with such weights), and a full range of motion. Go to stronglifts.com, and download the 5x5 workout for more info.|`|XQJg3RNTaa	ah, no that doesn't make sense to me? How many days of rest are you taking between lifts on the same muscle group?<br>  <br>  If your not getting at least one more rep, or going up in weight every time you workout you need to be taking more rest in between lifts. If your muscles are getting larger that means they're stronger so if your not lifting more than that means they're just not fully healed when you go to lift because of the damage from the last lift.<br>  <br>  Unless your taking creatine this doesn't make any sense, you either just need to try harder or take more rest.|`|eFW5O92Yaa	This could be a result of lifting the wrong way. Also you may want to go into powerlifting instead of just weightlifting. Were bodybuilders will do it one way, which is mainly to build muscle, which doesn't necesarily build a lot of strength. Powerlifters lift a little bit differently and will gain muscle and look pretty ripped, but they won't look just huge like bodybuilders do. You may want to look into this a little more.|`|y2Uks58paa	nope just keep it up and the strength will come. you could try adding 2-5 lbs every week on each lift if your not already too. also make sure to do the most weight you can with 1-3 reps once a week on each lift also. some people also use forced reps to add strength which works great if you have a partner, your strength will increase dramatically.|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Well that could be due to the rest and recovery pattern not being right.<br>  If you work out every day for example, yes you muscles will grow, but they won't strengthen as you that haven't had the full chance to recover from a heavy work out.<br>  Give muscle groups 48hr recovery and make sure you have a good intake of protein.  I'm sure all will be ok.<br>  <br>  Let me know if this helps.<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|NJLfjWSuaa	i had the same problem. What I did was I forced myself up in weight. try and force yourself up a tiny bit when you lift. even if you cant get as many reps in at first, they will come later. also, try a protein supplement, they help a lot in making sure you get every amino acid so that your muscles work correctly. hope this helps!

AekVyLneaa	Your muscles are probably a bit tender from coughing.  When you cough a lot, especially when you are sick, your muscles are overused and become sore.  It is very similar to the concept of working out.  When you work out and use muscles that you don't normally use, they become sore.  Your chest muscles are doing the same thing.|`|iFmMR2rOaa	I have a cold as well.<br>  <br>  Take paracetamol to stop most aches and pains, including yours.<br>  Also take Benylin original (buy from behind the counter at the pharmacy)|`|bEfLcpDuaa	It could just be chest congestion.

If you haven't had unprotected sex then it could just be stress because sometimes your body gets confused and starts bleeding because it thinks its time for a period. However, it could just be irregular periods like you've been having so I would talk to your doctor if you're not on the pill to go ahead and try that because its known to make periods regular. Good luck!|`|gzlz4i3Naa	mine always last this long. everybody's different, i wouldn't worry about it.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	read below - Very Heavy Menstrual Flow

vYQcRvW9aa	OK man well I use to have a nice 6 pack. I am just being extremely lazy lately haha. So as everyone will say 100s upon 100s of crunches add 10 every night till you get to what...1000? BULL.<br>  <br>  You want to stick to 3 exercises. 3 sets of each with about 20 reps.<br>  Each rep should be like a contraction so hold it for a few seconds.<br>  <br>  Id do something like:<br>  -Reverse Crunches<br>  -Leg Lifts<br>  -Bicycle Kicks (do for more then 20 for these though. For these i go for a bit more quantity at a bit faster pace i do a pyramid for these like 60,70,80 or even higher it depends on how good you are at them)<br>  <br>  and if you have the ab chair im thinking of do hanging leg raises, or the leg lifts on the ab chair as it will target them more.<br>  <br>  Lastly man I want to point out 3 things:<br>  1: WAAAAATTERRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!! lots of it to burn off the fat<br>  2: Im not going to tell you to diet cause your prob young like me but DO NOT EAT CRAP. and you know what i mean lol im not gona go into detail<br>  and lastly 3: Cardio is your best friend man. Run 3-4 times a week. Personally I was running daily for 15-20 minutes. As long as you don't exceed 30 minutes you wont burn muscle. But the 15-20 just burns off the fat calories you ate during the day.<br>  <br>  Best of luck man, in 2 weeks you prob wont get really nice abs, but it should def help you tone out a bit.|`|6Wqvntx8aa	You've left it too late, 2 weeks is not enough really.<br>  <br>  You should start by doing crunches, which will target the ab muscles specifically.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toning-belts.com/2009/01/straight-leg-crunches/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toning-belts.com/2009/01/stra...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.toning-belts.com/2009/01/raised-leg-crunches/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toning-belts.com/2009/01/rais...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.toning-belts.com/2009/01/side-crunches/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toning-belts.com/2009/01/side...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure you get in some aerobic exercise as well, to make sure you are burning fat.<br>  <br>  Finally, get an ab toning belt, although they usually take 6 weeks or so to get the best results.|`|K0NCjN7Jaa	If you are 6'2 and only 188 then you are pretty skinny. the best way to tone is hit up some hard cardio everyday.

The cardio will bring out the definition in your stomach.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	pilates 10 min ab solution is surprisingly useful.  sorry they took the video down from you tube.|`|HpqGnCFAaa	ok try do crunch sit ups. start with maybe 50 then add one everyday.

BRDqfAy3aa	during first year periods can be irregular (development process) - discover more below|`|wgm9ADfBaa	it will be irregular for about 1 year. so there is really no telling when it will come|`|eS9MfSvmaa	When I had my first period, I didn't have my next one for months after, and that's completely normal. It could come back in months, or weeks depending on how your body works. For me, it took almost a year, so maybe you're the same. It might be on and off like that for a couple of years until you grow older and all that stuff. Sooo, no need to worry. Just carry a pad around in your purse or bag to school and everywhere you go, just in case it starts. Most purses have small little zipper pockets put discreetly on the inside and you can put it there, in case you'd find it embarrassing to be caught with one.<br>  <br>  When it gets normal, you should get it regularly every month, so probably about 28 days.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!|`|LKZffm2saa	Well, youll probably be irregular if its your first period, so it could be months before you get it again, but regularly it comes back evry 26-28 days|`|M8jxBSJaaa	in the beginning it can be very irregular so dont worry<br>  <br>  do you play any sports? because sometimes when you are very active, you period will not occur|`|6683fa949dfc425a21a5980b5f9d8a9daa	When you first start out the cycle can be a little haywire, then it will eventually develop into a regular cycle.|`|s13Lwnq4aa	Once you get regular(meaning it comes every month) <br>  It comes a few days before the last time you got it.<br>  (meaning the date) So if I got mine the 17 of January<br>  I wouldn't have it til February 12-15. :) But, you may<br>  have just spotted and haven't FULLY started yet.<br>  Just be prepared for it hun.

But to get the most from your veggies and fruits, you should buy organic.  Today's non-organic foods are full of pesticides, fertilizers, and growth hormones to make them grow bigger and faster.  Also, your body tricks you.  Most of the time that you think you are hungry, you are actually dehydrated.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|gDO4KWgjaa	hi, the best way to lose weight is to make a little diary and take notes of everything you eat each day for a week.

SCiY5JESaa	BANANAS AND MILK FOR A YEAR|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.<br>  <br>  The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/gainweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...</a>|`|y2Uks58paa	your still young so just keep doing what your doing and you will start gaining very quickly once you hit 16 or 17|`|9PlDaDzuaa	I would recommend before you start making major increases in the amount of weight that you lift that you ask your parent or guardian to take you to your doctor. lifting too much weight when your growth plates haven't closed can actually cause them to close prematurely and stunt your growth. You doctor can probably make the best recommendations based of knowledge of you in particular. <br>  <br>  As well it takes time to build muscle. If you have been doing the same exercises for a long period of time it will help to change your routine. Your body becomes used to routines and you start seeing slower results if you make changes such as changing the exercise, increasing the weights, changing number of reps and sets it makes a difference. As well as when you work a body part you need to then give it a rest in order to repair. When you work a muscle you are actually in essence breaking down the tissue, muscles get bigger in the process they use to repair itself. If you break you body into three workouts - legs, back and biceps, chest, shoulders and triceps. Then after you do your legs the next day the back and biceps, then the chest, shoulders and triceps your body parts have time to heal prior to the next workout.Abs can be done ever couple days. I also recommend if you are working out daily to take a full day off without working anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  I must also say that you are young so don't get to caught up in this you have a lot of years to work out. You also need to make sure you like yourself for who you are and know that you have much more to offer people in your life than just your appearance. Make sure you are taking time to nuture all of you!<br>  <br>  GOod Luck|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	keep on lifting really heavy things.

It takes time and effort.  The best way is to set a specific schedule for yourself:  <br>  <br>  1. get into the gym 3-5 times a week<br>  2. have a set schedule as to what you are going to lift each one of those days. (e.g. Pecs and Biceps one day, Deltoids, lats and triceps one day, legs another day, etc.)<br>  3. Here's the key to building muscle; you NEED to add a little more weight or a couple more reps each time you go into the gym.  NOTE:  Be safe about it though, and know your limitations.  Work up to the heavier weights.<br>  <br>  Summary:  Consistent, 3-5 times a week, set lifting schedule for each day, add more reps or weights each time.<br>  <br>  Another good tip for building muscle is this: to get your cardio in, try doing circuit training instead of running or jogging.  Here's a good site for circuit training exercises: <a href="http://www.mensworkoutguide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensworkoutguide.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

But maybe it's just that they are really busy. Try not to take it personally. If they are nice and talk to you and do go places with you then they do care about you. You could also try making more friends.<br>  Try to figure out ways to stay busy when your alone, that will help you from being so down. <br>  Listen to upbeat happy music.

RXI8ImdIaa	Yes, an infection will cause your white blood cell count to be high.<br>  <br>  Your white blood cells are your body's defense against invading bacteria. When an infection is present, you produce large amounts of these cells in an attempt to kill the bacterial infection.<br>  <br>  In the context of having an infection, an elevated WBC count is a good thing. However it's not good to have an infection in the first place. If you are not being treated for the infection, you need to go to some other doctor right away, don't wait until the end of the month.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	your doctor is supposed to explain this to you<br>  not leave u guessing<br>  go there and demand her to explain the results to you<br>  if not then find a new doctor who will work with you|`|bbn2YvrKaa	Considering that you have an infection, your bloodwork looks fine to me. Increased white blood cells fight the infection. Your neutrophils (which are one type of white blood cell) increase particularly to combat bacterial infections. When the infection is eliminated, your white blood cell level will return to normal.
kC8JHWVQaa	It's estimated that 5,ooo,000,ooo condom's are used every year world wide...This is the only form of protection  to help stop transmission.( unless stop having any sex at all) pregnancy or other STDs. With proper use this will help alot to stop all above and HIV from spreading  Make sure any toys if have do get a condom as well. The pores in a condom are to small for viruses to pass threw so its very wise to wear one to protect you the man and for you the female as well But then again this may not be 100% either. On the other hand better than Nothing at all.|`|QgAu4b4zaa	Yes.  That is the only way not to infect the other person, if one is HIV positive and the other is negative. Unless, you abstain from sex. But, rememeber condoms are not 100%.
stCyrS4Eaa	Allowed? You question does not make sense. If you are any couple, you should practice safe sex if you do not want to have children. If one of you has HIV, you should practice safe sex. I do not understand the "allowed" part of your question.|`|6e8a2562119ae10db7789da7710dfe93aa	If you are asking if "safe sex", that is use of condoms and taking precautions with some other sexual practices is necessary, it would depend on whether both people hav the HIV virus. <br>  <br>  If only one ahs the virus, they should do all they can to protect the other person. But if both already have the virus, they cannot get it again or get it worse, so two people with HIV do not need to practise safe sex. I tis already too late for safety from the virus.

(Not a dietitians!) <br>  <br>  A nutritionist will help you eat healthy and give you good eating habits. The first thing they will ask you is to write down EVERYTHING you eat and drink fo two weeks. You should try starting that right now. When I did it, I was amassed to see how much I was eating in a day. I was also eating unbalanced and always turning to carbs. <br>  <br>  Get yourself the recommended daily food guide. It will inform you on how many of the food groups you should eat in a day. It will also help you with portions. We have a tendency to serve double or triple portion these days. Restaurants will serve overflowing plates of food and gladly publicize that they have 'big serving' or 'huge portions' but, it's not good for us!<br>  <br>  Also, start by leaving a table or a spoon full of food on your plate at each meal. By slowly making your portions smaller, you will slowly loose and won't feel deprived.<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)

reAtqf0Maa	well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong! this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|n4tPArAAaa	my friends does too and she minds and you cant change it|`|x6uCeQ5Aaa	Don't worry almost everyone has something they would change about their body if they could... First off I would say that you could work on some all over cardio exercise. This could be whatever you please whether it be running, bicycling, swimming, the eliptical. Try to do this cardio exercise for 30 minutes at least 3 times a week 4 or 5 would be ideal. As for the abs, you will need to build up your core strength. This can be done by doing planks (1 minutes front, then sides, repeat 3 times), and crunches (100-200 a day with a rest after a set of 20) every day. As for your diet, I don't really know what you usually eat so I am just giving general advice to you. Try to substitute one snack a day with fruit or veggies and drink at least 6 glasses of water. Cutting soda from your diet can be a huge help and can make you drop at least 5 lbs even if you do nothing else. I hope this helps and good luck!|`|mmMgfhf2aa	Try looking up the Squeem corset.

AND make sure you FLOSS. i didn't floss lthe first couple months and my gums got soooooo puffy! my gums on my side teeth almost covered my teeth. so make sure you floss so you could get all that extra food and bacteria out of your gums.<br>  <br>  the placement of braces does NOT hurt. the first day will also NOT hurt... but the next day and up to a week after, you will be sore. so take some advil. also, always have some orajel on hand, just in case.<br>  <br>  so, you will need:<br>  1. dental wax <br>  <a href="http://www.firstaidmonster.com/images/products/FAM_DENTAL_WAX-2593.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstaidmonster.com/images/pr...</a><br>  2. orajel<br>  <a href="http://www.expresschemist.co.uk/pics/products/7673/2/orajel.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.expresschemist.co.uk/pics/pro...</a><br>  3. interdental tooth brush<br>  <a href="http://www.boxoid.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/interdental_multibrush2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.boxoid.org/wp-content/uploads...</a><br>  4. advil<br>  <a href="http://www.wackypackages.org/realproductsscans/2004/jk/advil_small.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wackypackages.org/realproduct...</a>|`|kSWV0tlxaa	my birthdays on the 24th of March!<br>  Ive had bracess,<br>  they hurt me alot for the first three days then it settled down, but everyones different.<br>  advice: after your braces are off, always wear your retainer ( i didnt and now my teeth are wonkey :\ ) <br>  your othordontist will tell you how to clean and look after your teeth and braces!<br>  good luckk, x|`|fduPrlc0aa	My braces are coming off that day! (:<br>  <br>  Okay, how to brush- Brush like you normally do! But, do it longer. The first day brushing your teeth with braces will feel weird. You'll get used to it.<br>  <br>  The day you get them on, yes, they will hurt. When they are putting the braces on it won't but when your teeth start moving it will. The day I got braces, I drank a REALLY cold milkshake and it numbed the feeling.<br>  <br>  Tips-<br>  *Don't eat any nuts the first month. I did and I broke a bracket.<br>  *Popcorn is really difficult to eat and I say to not even bother.<br>  *Gum... If you want your braces off as soon as you can, don't eat it.<br>  But, I eat gum everyday and I'm getting mine off 2 months earlier then planned.<br>  *Brush in school if you can. During lunch, food will get caught in your braces (embarrassing) and until you learn how to take the food out with your tongue, (i'm an expert now :P) brushing your teeth is the way to go.<br>  <br>  The first week will hurt a lot, I'm not going to lie. But just eat soft foods. Drink soup, eat mashed potatoes, ice cream, pasta, anything that isn't crunchy.<br>  <br>  Good luck (:
UANpgVupaa	It's totally normal. No need to worry. It's human and it is likely that as you go along that it won't be so frequent - or maybe it will. Thinking about sex at 13 doesn't make you abnormal. You are hitting puberty if you haven't already - so yeah your hormones are having fun. Your totally fine.|`|0FSBiLQVaa	You are normal, your are just going through a normal stage in puberty. It is not sick and should be thought of as turning into a women, not something that is gross. I want to inform you that at your age please,please,please, do not have sex! You should read the care and the keeping of you and it is so amazing! They are both really good books <br>  that may help you. A good website is www.beinggirl.com! Though, no book or website will substitute the information an older sister, mom, or aunt can give you! Good luck!|`|2B6F5Zhtaa	No, your normal.<br>  I'm a guy and i used to think the same way. I'm 17 now and i'm over it. But i have a friend whos a guy who used to thin kthe same way and he's coem out as gay. And we dotn think any less of him for it.<br>  <br>  It's just because your at the point where tyou need to experiment with your feelings and find out what is right. Most girls i know have kissed another girls before they hit 17. Just to try it out, harmless :)<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad about it, but incase it goes down badly with other people around you don't go shouting about it :)<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|YBqr3irpaa	haha I started all of that pretty early like maybe 6th grade...

inST4SlAaa	Roxicodone and Oxycodone are the same thing except roxicodone is a brand name and oxycodone is a generic name. Roxane Laboratories makes brand name roxicodone and it is a little bit more expensive compared to the generic 30mg oxycodone. If you were to switch to oxycontin this might help you a little better because of course oxycontin is extended release and your 30mg oxycodone is immediate release so instead of taking 30mg 4x a day you can take 40mg oxycontin twice a day with maybe a breakthrough medication, it all depends on what works for you the best. GOOD LUCK

iEVEfPaVaa	There are many types of seizures and some do not involve the so called tonic-clonic jerking of your extremities.  Seizure was my first thought when I read your question.  But now I am more inclined to think you dropped your blood pressure, perhaps due to dehydration.  Had you been sweating a lot and did not drink a normal amount of water during the day before the run?  I would not be surprised if the sprain was the first symptom you had and you twisted your ankle because you were getting weak.  Then you fell and the rest of the symptoms followed while you were on the ground.  If this is the case, you should drink plenty of water and eat something light that is salty before your jogs.  It could, of course, be low blood sugar, but I'm sure the paramedics checked your blood sugar and it was normal.  If this occurs again and you know you have had enough water for the situation you should see a doctor very soon after that second occurrence.  But I hope the doctor already saw you in the emergency room and you should follow his instructions.  If you were told to see a neurologist to rule out a seizure please do that soon.  I rather doubt that it was a seizure but if it was you need to get on meds to control this.  Be very careful driving until you are properly diagnosed by testing by the doctor.  If you feel any hint that this is going to happen while you are driving pull over immediately.  Good luck.|`|ZBWVBdAGaa	maybe subconscious mind was in shock?^-^
k3ZVZmBJaa	Borderline personality disorder is one of the mental illnesses with which clinicians prefer not to treat because of the instability inherent in the person's ability to maintain normal relationships.  A crucial part of therapy is establishing a therapeutic relationship; so, when one is incapable of doing so, it can make treatment very difficult.  The associated manipulation and volatile interpersonal skills common to those with borderline personality disorder also make it a difficult illness to treat.  To that extent, there is a certain stigma among health care professionals (mostly nurses and general physicians) related to borderline patients.<br>  <br>  Having said that, a mental health professional is required to remain objective and nonjudgmental.  It should not matter what the diagnosis is, a competent mental health professional should treat the patient with positive regard, free of any negative reactions or stigmas.  Of course, clinicians are humans too, so it it obvious that no one is perfect.  The borderline clients with whom I work are often more difficult than others, but they have real needs and deserve the proper respect.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the general public, there is obviously a large stigma associated with ALL mental illness.  The public is so uninformed and ignorant that one cannot really expect, in most cases, that the general public will be respectful and understanding with respect to borderline personality disorder.|`|mi3Udvroaa	I think doctors generally don't like them. It's quite funny my friend just goes to his sessions with the psychologist, pisses about for like half an hour, then picks up his medications and buggers off. Haha, I would do the same.|`|rT3MfFvuaa	Borderline Personality Disorder is an almost brand new 'mental health issue' that has suddenly come to light!  It is extremely fashionable and the government is throwing millions of pounds at it.  Just like Attention Deficit (which is also very fashionable).  If parents took responsibility for their children and their actions and BDPs did the same for their actions, this money could be diverted elsewhere in the NHS where it is really needed.  I would also cite victims of Tourette's syndrome who burst into foul language at regular intervals, why don't they burst into nice language, i.e. yelling Roses, Ferrari's, Chocolate, Champagne?  I know of clinicians who feel the same but try telling the parents or partner of one of the above that their darling needs discipline and litigation is staring you in the face!

jgahsdXOaa	okay, spacers are nothing. i've had them. just make sure they dont come out. if they do,  just call ur ortho and tell them. the herbst, i've had that too. my honest thoughts are that it is okay. annoying-- on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, definitly a 10. it's soo annoying and it's kinda hard to brush your teeth with it. the pain scale, 1-10...eh...about a 5. it only hurts when your orthodontist does something to it. then it only hurts for like a week and you should be fine. other than that, just becareful of what you eat cause it's hard to eat with it(for the first week, you will get used to it) uhm...oh when you yawn, the rods might come apart. it's nothing to worry about. it scared the crap out of me at first, but if you just get a mirror, you can put the rods back together. it's no big deal. after a while i didn't even need a mirror. but yeah it's annoying cause i yawned a lottt. haha. but the day you get the herbst off will be one of the best days of your life! you will actually get to yawn and not deal with rods coming apart, you can chew your food soo much easier..ahhh :)<br>  <br>  i had my herbst for about a year...11 months probably. you get used to it after a while and it's no big deal. i have normal braces now, and in my opinion, they are more painful than the herbst. cause when they tighten the braces, ALL of my teeth hurt. the only pain my herbst caused me was slight discomfort in the jaw(only for a few days), and my teeth hurt when they made a rod longer/shorter, idr. but yeah don't worry about it. good luck! if u need help, just send me an email!!|`|F3Dhlzedaa	the spacers are probably the worst part. if they fall outdont worry bout them. the herbst dosent hurt it is just uncomfortable. i had braces(6 top) and herbst for ten months then got herbst off and rest of braces on. the baces will hurt.
8vTLjNzfaa	it depends really.<br>  <br>  on what you think as being happy. for example, getting new clothes can make you happy or someone coming to visit can make you happy. are you scared of that?<br>  <br>  sometimes, yes, there are always things that come an overshadow what you try and think<br>  <br>  just keep positive and stay positive, no matter what happens. itll change eventually and youll feel a lot better|`|r8drw5Dcaa	They have drugs for that now.<br>  <br>  <br>  OMG Dr. Atari you are insane!!|`|zj91sSsuaa	I like to think of life and karma as a scale with 3 points to put the weights.<br>  You have good 1, bad 2 and neutral 3.<br>  To me karma is hard to balance, because I think people get confused about it.<br>  You have your own personal scale, if someone else is involved with your scale it doesn't balance with just you, because the other person has to be weighed into the equation; you have to figure in the human factor.<br>  Some people think that if they do something good or bad, something good or bad will happen to them, and most of the time this is true, because other people are aware of it.<br>  <br>  Say you do something good or bad and get caught, the scale has to balance its self, it has to figure this other person within the scale, it is no longer a personal scale you now share it with that person.<br>  So how does karma balance the scale?<br>  The human factor will be the deciding vote; but if the outcome is good or bad, it will knock your personal scale off again.<br>  This is why most people don’t like to get involved with other people, especially if it’s bad.<br>  Let’s say you help and old lady across the street.<br>  You feel good about it right, and she feels good about being helped.<br>  At this moment the scale is unbalanced, the pivot point “Good 1” is too heavy.<br>  “Bad 2” and “Neutral 3” are ready to float away, karma will not let this happen.<br>  So now something bad has to happen to both of you, or one of you.<br>  But let’s say something bad happens to the lady.<br>  She gets mugged because you helped her get to the right place at the wrong time.<br>  Karma just balanced it’s self with the lady and you because you were involved with her getting to the right place at the wrong time.<br>  Had you not helped her, the old lady and the muggers never would have met, because the time would have been different.<br>  But you’re still feeling good about helping that old lady; your neutral is still lite.<br>  Karma will not let that happen, it has to balance again; you will have to feel bad again.<br>  <br>  So at this point you are asking “Well Dr. Atari, besides me thinking you are a total nut and should be locked away for the benefit of humanity!<br>  How can I be happy; how can I get good things to happen to me?”<br>  <br>  It’s very easy..<br>  You have to control Karma, it’s a bit tricky.<br>  If you want something good to happen then make something bad happen so Karma can balance it’s self in your favor.<br>  Do you really think people cut their fingers off on accident on construction sites?<br>  Hell no!<br>  They do it so something good will happen to them, the more extreme the better the outcome.

AA11593971	What you're seeing can't be sperm, my friend. More likely you are having some clear vaginal drainage... that perhaps looks like sperm... but believe me it's not sperm. If the drainage smells foul, you may have a vaginal infection and should see a doctor. But if your periods are regular and you have no other symptoms, I think it's safe to say, you are just seeing normal vaginal drainage.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't know how old you are, but I'm guessing you are a teenager. If so, it's possible your hormones haven't slipped into a normal pattern. Missed periods are not unusual, especially in the early teen years.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	you don't have sperm coming out of you every day. you have discharge. if you don't know the facts about your body, then you shouldn't be having sex.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	You could very well be pregnant.

It sometimes depends on the respiratory therapist who works with you to get it to fit right.  Some will had it to you and say "good luck"  others will have you try on several different types and styles of masks to see what fits best.  The second is the better of the RTs in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  Some masks are bigger then others but all can restrict your movement some.  You just have to find the best for you.<br>  <br>  Remember, if you are having to use a Cpap then you probably weren't resting well anyway.  With the Cpap on, you may sleep in the same position all night.  Most people will move around upon waking up because of their sleep disorder.  So if this corrects yours, you may not move much. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|rNsCkHEwaa	I've been using a cpap for about 5 months now and am feeling a lot better than before.  I've cut down my anti-fatigue medication by 2/3.  Because I know it will help me, I wear it every night and it's not an imposition.  It changes the way I move but I don't find it disruptive.

There is a thin tube, about the size of cap on a milk gallon, that will connect it to your face, you will still be able to move, but might have problems sleeping on your side. It may be difficult at first, but you will sleep much better in the long run. Dont be too worried, it wont be as bad as it sounds.|`|JFLm9WvDaa	The machine does make some noise, but it's not very loud. As another answerer stated, it sounds a bit like a fan. The RT that helped fit mine had me try on different masks and I decided that the nasal pillows were the most comfortable to me because it felt the least confining. Your movement is somewhat restricted, but if you get into a comfortable position, you probably won't move much while you sleep. I've had my CPAP for two years now and I still love it and sleep so much better than before I had it. Good luck to you.

Also i would recomend talking to a doctor, they my presrcibe you somthing to hepl with both your anxiety and recomend things you can do to counter act your OCD. I also want to point out that having a daily routine can somtimes make OCD worse, and cause you to develope rituals that you have to preform everyday ad that is the opposite of what you want. so see the doc and listen to what he says, and lay off the uppers if you taking any.|`|2WCIpi9Raa	Sounds like you have anxiety but you will never know unless you come off the drugs and figure out whats really going on with you. You need some help, therapy, talk to someone you trust. The drugs are making you feel worse even if you enjoy doing them. Is there something wrong that you are avoiding dealing with by doing the drugs? I hope you get the help you need to feel better.

Z8JSRx4Iaa	Headaches can happen for many reasons some like: Not eating, over sleeping, watching too much tv, & stress  but  if it continues you should go see a doctor.

She went to the DR. they did a scan and she had an infection in her brain! RARE BUT SHE HAD IT!! Anti-Biotic took care of it. But her Doctor kept saying how smart it was to come in and get it checked. So don't let it go on too long.|`|sibfHKVkaa	Are you sitting with good posture while using the computer? Are you stiff and keep your head in one position while your working? Try taking breaks more often by standing up and rolling your head back and forth. Stretching your arms up to the sky every now and then might help if your headaches are being caused from fatigue.|`|AA10065077	Headache means that your body is expierencing some kind of stress. If you are expierencing the headache right when you get off the computer it could mean that your screen is causing this for you. You could try taking more breaks or look away from the screen from time to time. It also could be your vision. You might need glasses so you might want to get an eye exam. Otherwise, it could be a lot of other things like blood pressure. If it keeps happening you need to talk to your doctor.
uRXZDs8kaa	This depends on several things:<br>  <br>  The day supply of the refill you got on 11/4. You may have to wait until at least 75% of the time is up until the next due date. (based on the doctor's directions, not on how many you actually take)<br>  <br>  Are the strength or directions different on the new prescription? If they are then you may be able to get the new RX filled sooner.<br>  <br>  Different states have different laws regarding how long the written prescription is valid. You can always take it to the pharmacy and ask them what the earliest date is that they can legally fill it for you.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend getting into the practice of taking your scripts to different pharmacies just to try and get them filled early. Eventually someone will catch on to you and notify your doctor who will stop writing your scripts. Then when you start doctor shopping it will become noticeable to the pharmacies you go to and they will eventually stop filling your scripts|`|hmsMpECkaa	You really need to take all the lortab you can if you got any left and go back to the doctor and complain of the pain you are having and get him to write 2 prescriptions for you.  And take all of those as fast as you can.  I would recommend at least 5 times the regular dosage.  |`|EtgKAtbuaa	No, lortab is a schedule III drug, your pharmacy will not refill it until after a certain date, usually after half of the original prescription should have been used eg. if there are thirty doses in one script and you take one dose per day then the pharmacy will replace it in 15 days at the earliest.<br>  <br>  Im not sure of the exact legal circumstances in whichever country you are in but that is the general rule.  |`|AA10065077	Well, that depends on how it is written and how many it is for etc. Like the other person said to be safe take it to a different pharmacy entirely. However, you might get caught if you have insurance. You don't have to get it filled right away. You can have the pharmacy hang on to it for you. You have 60 days from the date on the prescription to get it filled and another 6 months to use the refill.|`|b0077f44c83de7f16490cb2c3af25fdaaa	it depends on how many the script is for and how it is written.  Example  120 tabs  1 tab every 4to 6 hours is a month supply.  To be safe take it to another pharmacy.  Not another pharmacy of the same, but a different one completly. That will work.

Then she would go into the back yard to a child's picnic table set up for her and 3 dolls and have an imaginary luncheon while carrying on a conversation with the dolls (which was taped). When I took her and her brother to buy school clothes her mother and her mother's older sister went along. After buying her everything she wanted she and her aunt disappeared and reappeared later with a bag and my credit card, of course. My sister, not her mother, leaned over and whispered in my ear, "she needs them, she has buttons." On Oct. 24, her 17th birthday, my birthday present was 2 push-up bras from Victoria's Secrets. When I was buying the bras I had then in my hands looking at them when a woman with a 15-year-old daughter (34B) bumped into my side and looked at the bras in my hand. "There not for me," I said. "Oh, no, of course not," the woman said. "Oh, they're really not," I said, "look, (throwing back my arms) I'm not sagging, yet!"  That's how my niece got hers.

9EA3zdR2aa	well, most people seem to want to answer as if they are the surgeon general, rather than someone answering your questions for real... listen people, she is not asking because she wants your opinion on drug use.   Ambien is mostly just hilarious, because you kind of become discombobulated and very, very sleepy.  I almost wouldn't recommend it beyond being a new experience, and with beers and stuff you would probably pass out sooner rather than later.  Weed is MUCH better and more fun, but ambien is a weird experience that will be interesting certainly.

ozYNJRUraa	I think you should talk to your parents about it, and then go to your mom's obgyn, and go on "the pill", I had to go on it because the same reason, I was not regulated yet, and I have been on them for 8 months now, and they are still not working, as of yet. I have been having bad cramps also, but so does my mom, I am 17, almost 18, so I know what you are going through.

My doctor at the time told me that it can happen and is normal when you first start menstruating.  I can't imagine it all the time.  I agree with the above poster.  If it is unpleasant enough go see a doctor and birth control can help regulate it.  The pill can make your periods shorter and lighter as well.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure how normal it is.  Everyone has a natural rhythm.  I used to get mine every 45 days, instead of monthly, but mine are now regulated because I take birth control to prevent pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Bottomline, this situation sounds awful to live with.  I suggest seeing a doctor and seeing what he/she would suggest.<br>  <br>  Also, look into the possibility that you may have Endometriosis.

Take a cup of hot water. Add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, and LOTS of honey to make it taste better. Then drink that puppy down. The honey will soothe your throat, and lemon juice helps the infection go away. <br>  <br>  Both the above remedies cost less to make than the stuff you buy at a drug store, and they're better for you.

hvfopGh2aa	I have the same exact problem! I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep in a night since I was about 14 years old... and I'm now 19. I've tried everything. I just don't get tired until at least 6:00am, even if I've been awake all day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should try having a few drinks before you go to bed... that sometimes works for me.

I'm no doctor but I highly doubt you've been stressing for more then 12 years. Some of my friends have problem sleeping as well and they told me they are taking NyQuil. It works for them so maybe it will work for you. But remember don't take heavy doses because your body can become dependent on it.|`|AA10065077	First tell you doctor about the Topamax. Second, it's your internal clock that needs fixing. That is the clock in your body that tells you to be awake at a certain time, when you normally wake at a certain time.

They include pills, liquids, nasal sprays and eyedrops. Many people get the best relief from a combination of allergy medications.

LQ2Pau9Faa	no. your friend needs to read a little closer.  nowhere does the Bible call masturbating a sin.  in fact it isnt even mentioned at all.  it says we should not lust, but lust goes far beyond a passing fantasy.  if you fixated on one person, perhaps you have crossed that line, but usually people entertain many fantasies while masturbating.  personally, i believe especially for people without a partner, it is a good tool to help them cope and live happily. i believe we often expect too much of ourselves.  we are only flesh and prone to sin and certain needs and desires.  we are never going to be perfect, let alone expecting the impossible.  we were not built to go years without partners, and masturbation can be a means of getting by.|`|eiGUOeleaa	well, personally I think that IF you receive a ticket to hell, its ALWAYS one way.<br>  <br>  But as per masturbating..

If he did that he wouldn't be very loving, now would he?<br>  <br>  I know many people that go to christian colleges.. When faced with the issue 98% of them will say they have at one point masturbated in their life. I have little doubt your friend is in that 98%.. Also, ask him about Gods forgiveness, and if hes ever lusted after a woman, lied, or broken any of the commandments, ever. Then say to him "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone".

Anyway it had a whole chapter on masturbation.  What the author did was hand out a list of questions at churches I guess, to men about their sexuality.  He found among other things that all the men or almost all of them masturbated.   Even after getting married many of them did.  I went to a christian college and a few of us guys in the dorm room got on the subject and came to the same conclusion.  The author of the book said it is just a part of being male and that it isn't something to be hung up on.  We all do it and it is a part of life.  My feeling is this guy does it to, feels it's wrong and says he is agaisnt it and is embarrased he does it.  Just cut him a little slack about it.  Most christian men feel it is wrong but do it anyway.  And when I say they do it I'm saying like once or twice a week, maybe more.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	read the bible! it says that whoever have,nt sined throw the first stone. everyone was born into sin. the only way out of it is ask god to forgive you of your sins and repent.|`|0Umym3h9aa	Not only do you go to hell, but masturbation is also the reason the dinosaurs died.|`|M7SyJZr5aa	yea u only turn blind.. im blind.. it sucks..  o yea, uhmmm i read braille n my super computer turned your question to braille. dont ever masturbate! youll go blllliiiinddddd!!!|`|6711a1d84892dbba34b6771f8ea24977aa	Yeah, but at least I'm enjoying the ride.|`|t9t3ovyraa	I don't think so because it is natural.|`|mZ85ifeQaa	NO!<br>  <br>  If it is, I'm going to hell, so mostly everyone in the world, and (IMO Hell is a man made contruct, that hell is only an idea, like I believe this: "Every man before he dies shall experience hell.")

UjTX851faa	Well there are certain levels to wait to know how urgent this is. You see I dont know how bad he hits you. See there are limits even in todays society. I feel that your dad does this when he gets angry. It is not your that sets off this anger. You are only an excuse for him to take it out. That is why it seems like if you do a little dumb thing wrong he freaks. Plus, you are a boy. Your dad was beat when he was young and not nicely. That has not helped because he has only carried it through in him It is not healthy for you to be in that situation. Now I will tell you not my story because this is yours. But I come from that same sort of household of four two girls and two boys, in that order. Our dad beat the oldest boy for no reason. It was rediculous. Even though we all got beat you know he got it the worst... My point? You have to know what it is like before you can help someone with this problem... That is why I decided to.<br>  ... Now there is no reason to kill yourself. That would be out of the question and the wrong way to go. I know it is hard but there are easier ways out of this. I currently no longer live in the household neither does my brother he is only 13. So, as you can see there are ways you. If you have a mother. That is your gate way... She may not be happy there. She does not know? You need to realize that she is the way out. I would not call control if you do not have scars or bruses on you because they will just cause a scene. You just have to be patient. Now he is not going to beat a girl. For he learned in his family it was the boy who was the one to take the beating. Yes, this is unfair and you need to take action...<br>  ... You need to talk to your mother and or talk to your dad. If anything you hate him inside and that is why he will never listen. For you can get around his mad exterior he puts forth. I am thinking sunday afternoons when he is calm. Talk to him... If you dont want to do that you will have to be patient... <br>  ... I do suggest that you email me. I have seen many cases like this. I would need a few examples of the actual "beating" and I could give you further options... I just want to make sure that I suggest the neccessary option and the best one...<br>  I hope that helps...<br>  You can go to my profile and email me if you would like to get more info. Or need someone to talk to you.|`|UuxLLNNoaa	I would tell my teacher they will know what to do.|`|AA10065077	Don't kill yourself.

Trust me, karma does come back. Because I was held more accountable I became more independent and successful than my brother who became very dependent on our parents. <br>  What you need to do is garner the courage to do what is right. I don't know how old you are, but if things are so bad that you'd rather die then you have nothing to lose but to tell your teacher. I did this and my parents lied and said I was lying. It may take more than one try. Go to community counselors. Go to police with evidence. Have friends (I know you may not have many - that's how it usually goes in these situations) or people take pics of your bruises, cuts, and other injuries so you have evidence. My mom used all sorts of things to beat me and left plenty of scratches and scars. <br>  It's scarry to be abused. But it's scarier to be so paralyzed with fear you're too scared to help yourself. It takes a lot of bravery and courage. Trust me. Pray and take the risk. You have nothing to lose except the ability to improve your life and safety. Please do this as soon as possible. Do not run away from home - this will only make things worse. Look up programs for people in your situation at a public computer or library so you're parents don't track down your computer activties. Be brave and believe in yourself. Your life will improve - trust me. Just be able to let go of your anger so that it doesn't consume you and cause you to hurt yourself (like suicide) - because then your parents will have won. You can only hurt them by proving them wrong and becoming happier and more successful then them and you can't do this by living with them. I'll pray for you.

JGjwHrqAaa	Well you have a lot of things going on here. Schitzophrenia would hear voices in the head. Also there would be people that aren't real and hard times seperating reality from stuff that u think happened. Bi polar is another one that could possibly be ur prob. Bi polar people will experience happy mad than sad within 2 mins. People with bi polar will flip moods on a drop of a dime. Also they tend to get violent and tend to have lots of sexual thoughts. Now that's not all of them but the majority of them I have delt with. Also adhd is something that a lot of youth get. It causes a short attention span. Very very hard to stay focus and concentrate on the job at hand without thinking of something else. Constantly fidgeiting and have to move. A ball of energy. I think that's gonna be the culprit in ur case. U will then get really tired after using so much energy. Talking to yourself is normal. We all do it. It keeps us sane. You shouldn't keep these things to yourself. U r not wierd. There's like 1 out every 3 people have something mental going on. Keeping it in will multiply it over time. Get a counsler. They are trained to diagnose u and help u overcome this. U will be thankful u did. Also remember this.suicide is a permanant solution to a temporary problem. And that's what u got a problem. Every problem has a solution. U just have to be willing to figure it out. Email me if u need someone to talk to. I'm always on.

If you feel like your going to explode get up and walk away to cool down, your not worthless.|`|ygsrahvtaa	you might have schitzophrenia.or bi polar disorder.|`|oIW5hHj3aa	From the sounds of it, you might have bipolar, or you might have a different one: ADD. ADD makes it hard to focus, and because of that you might be getting frustrated with yourself, causing all of those negative feelings. The changing of the moods also sounds like bipolar, and it is not unlikely to have a combination of the two. But not to worry, both are very treatable with proper medication. Just talk to a physician or psychologist, to help sort out your feelings and possibly write you a prescription. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	If this has been going on for a few weeks, it sounds like it could be some kind of mood disorder (depression or bipolar disorderor seasonal affective disorder).  If you really are so sad that you want to die sometimes & feel worthless a lot, you should be seen by a professional.  Show your yahoo question to a parent and ask them to take you to see a counselor or psychiatrist for an evaluation.  For me, the way the bipolar came on was I would cry and cry over my math homework periodically, even though I was very good at math. When I got a bit older, then I would just cry for no reason and play my stereo loud so my parents couldn't hear me sobbing.  The bipolar just got worse, but in those days, there wasn't the internet to ask for advice & I didn't know I wasn't normal. <br>  <br>  So please get advice from your mom or dad - it sounds like you do have something wrong. If you can't talk to them, talk to a trusted aunt or uncle or grandparent -a pretty smart, stable adult that will listen to you.<br>  <br>   a couple tips - for now, these will help:  make sure you are getting enough sleep. Don't listen to sad music - listen to upbeat stuff.  Get out with friends as much as you can, it helps.  Exercise regularly. And if you are really hurting inside, read a novel or do a puzzle or something else that keeps your mind really distracted.<br>  <br>  All the best to you!|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Sweetheart, if you are hearing voices in your head this is a serious issue. You have to discuss this with your mom or another trusted adult maybe a school counselor. If it is a mental illness you need help there are medications that will stop the voices in your head. You seem to have depression which could possibly be connected to the illness of the voices you are hearing. You need professional help. Please discuss this with someone who can get you the help you need.  You don't have to live with this. I wish you the best!

In a hot tub with baby oil is how I stretched mine to where it is now.  At first I was really tight.  Now you can drive a truck in there and park side ways.  <br>  <br>  Ask the Doctor about how this stuff works... I never needed any.  After a few months of stretching mine in a hot tub it got better, but take it easy.  Little progress over a long time is best.<br>  <br>  Your best answer.|`|tWePoJYNaa	You might want to call the doctor quickly about this one. They'll answer your question super fast on the phone and you wouldn't have to go in. If it's a prescription it should have come with some sort of directions. I would start with a pea sized amount and see if that's enough to cover the whole area and be absorbed. Don't go overboard! I'm sure it's okay if the cream gets on other parts of your body. But I wouldn't put any clothes on right after you apply the cream, let it air dry a bit first. Good luck!|`|c77f4c6237342f7110ef4e18737bd881aa	Ah, excellent questions to ask that doctor, eh?

Just enough for the skin to absorb.  No more, no less.<br>  <br>  Avoid letting too much of the cream get on your head, but don't stress about it.

Just remember that exercising reduces your appetite. So you don't have to bother think of how much and what you are gonna eat when you do regular and huge sweaty exercises.<br>  The best exercise is a 5 min run then 10 by one week followed by 15 and last 20.

2sycPf8Daa	Your doctor may have you undergo a physical examination and ask you about your recent activities. By feeling the painful joint and surrounding area, your doctor may be able to identify a specific area of tenderness. <br>  <br>  If it appears that something else may be causing the discomfort, your physician may request an X-ray of the affected area. If bursitis is the cause, X-ray images can't positively establish the diagnosis, but they can help to exclude other causes of your discomfort. <br>  <br>  Although you usually can trace bursitis to events of overuse or pressure, there may be no obvious cause. In the latter case, your doctor may want to perform additional screening to rule out other causes of joint inflammation and pain. This may include blood tests or an analysis of fluid from the inflamed bursa. <br>  <br>  Bursitis treatment is usually simple and includes: <br>  Resting and immobilizing the affected area ,Applying ice to reduce swelling ,Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve pain and reduce inflammation ,With simple self-care and home treatment, bursitis usually disappears within a couple of weeks. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, your doctor may recommend physical therapy or exercises to strengthen the muscles in the area. Additionally, your doctor may inject a corticosteroid drug into the bursa to relieve inflammation. This treatment generally brings immediate relief and, in many cases, one injection is all you'll need. <br>  <br>  If your bursitis is caused by an infection, you'll need to take antibiotics. Sometimes the bursa must be surgically drained, but only rarely is surgical removal of the affected bursa necessary. <br>  <br>  Take care as always.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	your body can play many tricks on you , I have had chest pains since 17 , I did all the tests at the hospital and even wore a heart monitor and all the tests said im fine,  burning and numbness sound something with a nerve in the spine or brain that probably missfired  , have a neurologist check you out to see your back and brain to see if it can be a onset of a nervous system disorder.

Try this: lie on your stomach and place your forehead on a stiff pillow so your neck and spine are straight. Raise your left arm and right leg and hold for 5 seconds. Do the same for the opposite arm and leg. Then raise all arms and legs in a Superman pose for 10 seconds. Do 5 sets each day and build up to more if you want.

X1j7qYkUaa	So if you're sexually active, then you have to accept that it comes with the territory, at least apparently some know their status - the question should be of those you don't know the status of.  And decide what your level of personal risk will be... <br>  <br>  As it pertains to hiv, even safe, it could be considered a criminal action, if they fail to reveal their status prior to high risk activity. More so if the partners are male. An obvious bias on multiple grounds of course. <br>  <br>  But if you choose to press charges at any point - it has a better chance of standing. Particularly as there remains paranoia of bug chasing culture and stealthing, and the promotion of monogamy as an ideal. Or waiting for marriage to become legal. <br>  <br>  Another option may include finding fk buddies or clubs requiring proof of regular testing between partners. Of course, that also still involves a level of trust and risk. <br>  <br>  As to cruising in general, it's a game of risk. So are relationships. I find that people aren't getting tested regularly nor getting tested for more than just hiv. <br>  <br>  There's no clear cut answer without the adjustment in your activities, such as using toys (with or without partners) instead, abstaining, or keeping to low-risk activities. <br>  <br>  you could make a suggestion towards legal concerns that would sway most people. <br>  <br>  However, it might keep a few from disclosing their status at all, again, at least those that are aware of it.|`|j7HncXuuaa	tell them you understand But learn as much as you can about them.

AA11080288	I agree with other respondents about help being necessary (and help can be accessed relatively easily through social services, alcohol/drug services , specialised dementia groups etc.  But I also sense that this entire situation is far from straightforward and will need a lot of unpicking a lot of thought and a great dealof time.  Here are a few thoughts - Do you have any siblings or other close family.  What do they know of/think of the situation.  Do you live at home? How often do you see this?  Have you spoken to your Mum or Dad about any of this?.  Do you know how long this has been going on for have you asked them how they see the situation and if either of them want to do anything to change the situation.  People can get verY attatched to their addictions and illnesses and do not always want to be 'cured'.  This will definitely be an issue if your Mum is an alcoholic, regardless of whether she accepts this as true or not.  Does your Dad have a drink problem?  Do you know which came first, the dementia, the illnesseses or the alcoholism.  I think you will find that all these things are horribly interlinked.  If in some fantasy world your mum could be whisked away (and if she wanted to do this), taken to a lovely place with physicians, alcohol counsellors, psychologists, physiotherapists, and lots of kind people who fed her, sorted out her secondary health problems and most importantly stopped her drinking, now and in the future, I am sure that her dementia would improve, her incontinence improve or dissappear altogether and she would get strong and well again.  If this could be done for her, for a minimum period of 18 months, and if there were no cost issues, well then it would be a fine world we live in.  But then what would happen at the end of this, where would she go, what about her marriage, what about your dad?.. Caring for someone with your Mum's problems is incredibly soul destroying as well as being damned hard work.  Perhaps your Dad just does not know what to do anymore.  Whilst buying her alcohol does no help in the long run, have you ever witnessed what happens if he refuses? Whatever happens it will not be pretty.  And if she is a full blown alcoholic in poor health then sudden wirthdrawl of alcohol without drugs and intensive medical support will probably kill her any way..  She may not be as keen to stop drinking as you think, your Dad may just be at his wits end and have his own emotional/addiction problems.<br>  Unless you already do live at home, try spending a month living with them, so that you get to see the whole picture.  If you did this you could at least make sure she ate better, was clean  and cared for.  This would also give you time to think the whole thing through and start to approach sources of help.  Her alcoholism will cause some added complications but will not affect her right to any help.  Also remember people won't change or 'get better' just because you think they should.  They need to really really want to, and then some.  GOOD LUCK, YOU WILL NEED IT.  i FEEL i HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF YOUR FAMILIES PROBLEMS.  a LOT CAN BE DONE, MAKE SURE YOU CAN COPE WITH THE INVOLVEMENT AND CARE THAT WILL BE REQUIRED OF YOU, AND TRY NOT TO BLAME ANYONE.

1YLZki4taa	What is the Herbst Appliance? <br>  This appliance encourages the lower jaw to grow in a forward direction by positioning it forward and holding it there. It also has the ability to push the upper molars backward. <br>  How will it feel? <br>  At first, the Herbst Appliance may feel like a mouthful of wire but within a week they will become quite comfortable. It may irritate the inside of your cheeks at first but soon the tissue will toughen up to the appliance and not be a problem. Please call your doctor immediately to report any prolonged cheek or tongue irritation. <br>  <br>  What about eating? <br>  Chewing will be awkward at first. You may want to stay with softer foods for a day or two. But very soon you will be back to a normal diet (with the exception of sticky and brittle foods, of course). <br>  <br>  How long will you wear them? <br>  Normally, the Herbst Appliance is in for a minimum of 12 months. <br>  <br>  What is the best way to get used to it? <br>  First, don't play with it with your tongue or fingers. Secondly, don't fight it! Let your jaw go where the Herbst lets it.

It prevents you from becoming pregnant up to a percentage, however it's recommended that you don't take it regularly as birth control, that's what the box mean. If you have Birth Control Pills, you should be taking those everyday, not only after you had unprotected sex, cause BCP helps you prevent pregnancy up to about 98% if taken right.<br>  HOWEVER, yes you CAN take the two together, and it won't do you any harm. I've done it before, and I ended up not pregnant. <br>  Don't worry sweetie, your late period's probably just a sign of stress.<br>  Another reason your period could be late is if you took the bcp pills.

c1l3m4r1aa	The second answer is almost Perfect the only thing i can add is that yes about 40% of people can touch there chin to there chest when they have bacterial meningitis i know this because my son had meningitis just over a year ago and i also thought that he shouldn't be able to touch his chin to his chest and he could i spoke to his dr at the hospital when they still didn't know what was wrong with him and they brought up meningitis and i said that it wasn't possible because he could touch his chin to his chest and he said that allot of people with this disease can still touch there chin to their chest.<br>  <br>  The first symptom that appears can vary from person to person but with my experience an knowledge of meningitis i would say the first thing would be a fever with cold hands and feet followed by vomiting and being lethargic PLEASE know that the last symptom of meningitis is a rash so you need to be at the hospital before it gets to that point and also most forms of meningitis don't have a rash at all.<br>  <br>  (Viral meningitis is another story as it is not life threatening and has different symptoms and a much better outcome and in most cases you can also touch you chin to you chest with viral meningitis)|`|AA12358000	Twopacoutlawz2,<br>  Basically the answer is 'usually not'. However, I shall explain - meningitis – means inflammation =“itis” of the “meninges,” hence – “meningitis” = is an infection of the fluid of a person's spinal cord and the fluid that surrounds the brain and is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. High fever, headache, and stiff neck – not being able to touch the chin to the chest - are common symptoms of meningitis in anyone over the age of 2 years. These symptoms can develop over several hours, or they may take 1 to 2 days. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, discomfort looking into bright lights, confusion, and sleepiness. The subarachnoid space is located between the middle layer (arachnoid mater) and the thin inner layer (pia mater) of tissues called meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. This space contains the cerebrospinal fluid, which flows through the meninges, fills internal spaces within the brain, and helps cushion the brain and spinal cord. When bacteria invade the subarachnoid space, the immune system eventually reacts to the invaders, and immune cells gather to defend the body against them. The result is inflammation. Severe inflammation can spread to blood vessels within the brain, sometimes causing clots to form. A stroke can result. Inflammation can also cause widespread damage to brain tissue, causing swelling (oedema) and small areas of bleeding. If swelling is severe, it can increase pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure), causing parts of the brain to shift. If these parts are pressed through one of the small natural openings in the tissues that separate the brain into compartments, a life-threatening disorder called brain herniation results.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

Simple lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and eating a high-fiber diet, can go a long way toward alleviating constipation.

Most people who have constipation don't seek a doctor's care.

6NA2MXNPaa	Try going to bed a little earlier, 10 or 11pm. It'll be difficult at first because you'll just lay there with your eyes open, but stay in bed, you'll eventually fall asleep and your body will get used to it. Then, yes, start setting an alarm to help you get up earlier in the morning. Whatever time you think you should get up is what time you should set the alarm for, maybe 9 or 10am. You'll get plenty of sleep still. You just need to stick to it and your body will then become accustomed to those times.

Keep your calories above 900 or 1000 and you'll see much better results in the long run. You don't need to do 210 sit ups a day to see results. Do more running and less situps, it will increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories throughout the day and allowing you to eat more. And if possible eat 4-6 small meals, around 300 calories per meal depending on the time of day, it will keep your metabolism higher throughout the day vs 3 mid size meals.

I had crazy neighbors not that long ago and as long as I had a bad attitude about it just kept getting worse.  When I realized that the only way to help myself was to help them, I started praying for them to get a wonderful home of their own.  Guess what a couple months later they were gone - got a big house in another neighborhood.  Their happy - I'm happy.  You know you could always talk to him and ask him how he is.

Exercise is always good and it's important to stay active but if when you get done you still binge eat or eat excessively then of course it will be more difficult to lose the weight you want to. The best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia. When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite. If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet. With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel. Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight. You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight. If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did. Desert Burn Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors. Here's a site that inspired me and taught me a lot of dieting and nutritional tips that I still use today. All my best to you and keep your chin up.  GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia : for more help and info.|`|liP75hiwaa	How about skipping (jump rope) can you do this?<br>  Check that you can do a fitness programme first, then...<br>  Start gently and build up slowly over the weeks to about 30 mins or more a day.<br>  You can do it pretty much anywhere, there are a range of other exercises you could do also that don't need you to go to a gym or go out running.<br>  Try to eat more fibre, this will help keep you feeling full.<br>  Try to add more protein: tofu, beans, lentils, etc., or even dairy and eggs if you eat these.<br>  Try not to eat anything that tastes sweet, other than fresh fruit.<br>  Keep your calories down to your appropriate amount, when you feel bored, do some star jumps(jacks) or squats... if you do it for about 1 or 2 mins you should feel more energised and not bored any more.  If you are really bored try to learn a physical ability like balancing on one leg for a certain amount of time or handstands or something a little easier like a pushup (pressup).<br>  <br>  Hope it helps. contact me on website if you would like more advice.|`|249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?

However, many people find this very challenging to do, and look for quick and easy answers to their weight loss challenges.<br>  <br>  The biggest challenge for people to lose weight with diet and exercise is to be able to change long time habits.  I feel strongly that it is a mind set that causes more people to be overweight than their physical makeup.  I used a change of my mindset to help me lose weight.  The first key to doing this is to identify what conversations you are having with yourself that stops you from making the little daily choices you need to make in to help you lose weight.  Again this is what I did and it worked wonders.<br>  <br>  So before you go under the knife, check out more natural solutions and identify what conversations you are having with yourself that are stopping you from making the simple daily choices that will promote healthy weight loss.  <br>  <br>  By the way,  a lot of people think they need to lose weight to be happy.

I got my bench up by doing certain number of reps along with PT. (physical trainng). i would advise that you try looking on some body building web sites and find your percentage of max. like 70, 80, 90 percent and start using those percentages at a certain number of reps to increase your bench. now if you find yourself at a plateau then begin doing rack bench along with a regular workout until you over come that plateau. i havethe record at my school this year for benching 135 the most times. that record is 37 without a spotter. every friday try benching 135 AMAS (as many as possible) that is called bench burnout. your bench should steadily go up and when you are able to bench 225 do the same burnout routine with 225 instead of 135. hope this helps.

f7yJQbB4aa	Well the obvious first thing is to eat healthy. Lots of veggies. Maybe give up red meat. Stick to chicken or fish, or maybe even give it all up and eat vegetarian. But yeah, lots of vegetables. Oh, and I heard a tip that eating bananas helps too.<br>  <br>  There's always little ways to get exercise into your busy schedule. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Trace letters with your feet as you sit. Park your car farther from the building you work at. These little things do add up.<br>  <br>  If all else fails and you want that hourglass look really bad, do corset training. It's a little pricey, but it's more pleasant than liposuction and gives you a better shape. You don;t have to go for the extremes. Just go for the ideal (a waist to hip ratio of 0.7).|`|p7BakN0Saa	Targetted weight reduction is quite tough, some would declare impossible, however the sole diet that really worked for me is green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I lost 25 pounds, it really does work!
8OBjQ5R6aa	You can get a lot of false answers on this helpful, but dangerous site. If some one gives you bad advice, and you follow it...there will be consequences.<br>  <br>  First, ask your parents about it. At the school have the nurse check it out, and tell the teachers. I know you don't want to be the tattle tale but this is way more serious than a logy or a punch in the stomach.<br>  <br>  I rated all the answers to this question, if an answer has a thumbs down, please ingor that answer.|`|AA10943257	Knock the f***king crap out of those people!! a guy in school who bullied me pierced my arm with a compus and it bled, was really sore, but if I could go back to school now I wouldnt tolerate it, you shouldnt either hun.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Yeah.

You have removed the staples, right? You didn't state that in your question.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Yes it can give you an infection. <br>  <br>  Will it? I don't know. Keep the wounds clean and covered.

Look up xanax in PDR & take lowest dose possible. Some need very little and others can be sedetive resistant.
jE0Y9su5aa	Yoga is a great way to tighten chest muscles and tone the breasts. Several yoga exercises that focus on working against gravity, such as backbends, Shirsasana (Headstand), and Viparita Karani (Inverted Leg Stretch) are great at uplifting breasts since they oppose the gravitational force which pulls the breasts downward. Other poses such as Bhujangasana (Snake Pose), Ushtrashasana (Camel Pose), and Dwikonasana (Double Angle Pose) are great for strengthening the pectorals and correcting the body posture. Proper posture can subtract years from aging breasts, making them look firmer and uplifted.<br>  <br>  Avoid doing forward bends, contracting poses, jogging, and running. They are detrimental to sagging breasts.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	do some upper Body exercises.... but remember... if you are trying to lose weight by exercising, u must make it a habit, cause once u stop... you will gain 2x the weight you lost.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	Sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in
0HYG8PlNaa	Well my only and very Last experience was that I drank to much water with milk of Mag and had diarrhea for a whole day! Lol, That was terrible! Well that wasn't my last because a few months later I forgot and did it again and had to call in to work cuz I wasn't going to leave the potty. bad bad bad.
AA11550519	You have a serious misconception. Your body burns calories to<br>  i) Carry out necessary bodily functions<br>  ii) React to the demands you place on it(like the workout)<br>  <br>  One necessary bodily function is that of thermoregulation; your body wants to maintain its temperature. If you are in a cold place, it will burn calories to heat up. In the hot tub YOU WILL NOT BURN CALORIES! At least, not more than you need to stay alive. The hot tub is comfortable because it is free enery for your body.|`|Af8LQHR1aa	Hey<br>  Man i hate those stupid answers about like, green tea and acai berries that DO NOT answer your question at all. lol<br>  Well i TRIED to look up an answer for you, and i did get mixed messages of yes and no. but here is one answer that i found:<br>  <br>  Your body will burn more calories in a hottub/sauna in an attempt to cool itself. But the number of calories burned in that process is negligible. <br>  <br>  The illusion of weight loss (while technically not an illusion because you do lose weight) comes in the form of lost water from sweating. The lost pounds do not come from fat.<br>  <br>  Just use the Temperature of the Body as A.<br>  <br>  And use the Termperature of the hottub/Sauna at B.<br>  <br>  The 3rd law of Thermodynamics states that when two bodies at different Temps are put in a closed system, they will reach a homeostatic temp C.<br>  <br>  Since B > A....then your bodies temperature will increase.<br>  <br>  Result is you burn more calories.<br>  <br>  Oh and also, i don't know if it is true or not, but my friend had told me that your body is still burning calories up to an hour after your work out. i don't really believe it, but it could be true! haha
h6Vwpsrhaa	You burn about 2200 calories a day just with your weight and height, so if you only consume 1300-1500 calories a day, you could lose about a pound every 5 days.<br>  Thats a great rate :)<br>  To really fasten the process, excercise for about a half hour everyday!<br>  <br>  Xox.|`|MF9YknDYaa	Why are there fat people?is it really that easy?No it never works.|`|ii6Qe0tsaa	As long as you don't go ghandi you'll be fine.
YCmvBc05aa	The best thing will be to get in touch with somebody in the student union of the Harvard Dental School.<br>  <br>  You can get the info from the web site.<br>  <br>  Once you contact them ask them what you would like to know.<br>  <br>  Maybe they will assign a student to work with you to provide you with all the info that you need.<br>  <br>  You can also email the admissions office and get a brochure to find out what the requirements are for admission.<br>  <br>  That is what I did. I couldn't make it to Harvard though ! <br>  <br>  I went to PENN.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|wOecmtrzaa	It really shoudln't matter what you take now in HS except for getting into school.  you know dental schools really only take students who have bachelor degrees, not even college juniors usually get in.<br>  <br>  Just concentrate on going to school for college wherever you want to go, and once you are in college worry about getting the prereqs.<br>  <br>  Take as many AP classes as you can; this makes it easyer to keep up your science GPA at university because you don't have to go through general chemistry weed out, for example.  <br>  <br>  You  can go anywhere to college and then apply to harvard DS to get your DMD there from any undergrad school.<br>  <br>  Start doing some dentistry work in your town-- ask if you can shadow your general dentist for a couple days during the summer, or ask if you can be an intern for them washing laundry and sterilizing insturments.  <br>  <br>  Also develop hand skills: play an insturment, take up sculpting or drawing/painting to show them you can use your hands very finely.<br>  <br>  It doesn't accept transfer students means if you are at dental school at VCU and you want to stop going to VCU and start at Harvard, you wouldn't be able to.  Your stuck wherever you are in the beginning of your dental school career.|`|gZqoQg8Oaa	This is Harvard's main webpage with all the information you need to get to know what the school is looking for in a student and there are links for applying for their program.

BVbhOn1Naa	You're not alone!  I've been having the same problem... I'm 21 and I also had two doses of Depo but decided to get off of it because I hated it.  (I gained 15 lbs the first 3 months).  It was supposed to wear off in November, but I didn't get my period back until the middle of February. Now whenever I have an orgasm I bleed approx. a teaspoon of blood just a couple of minutes after.    <br>  <br>  Over the phone, a nurse at my doc's office said I bleed after orgasm because of the contractions/spasms that rock the uterus.  She doesn't know if the Depo is related to it.  I have an appt to see me doctor Monday, so maybe I'll get a better answer then?  Email me at swizzle05@yahoo.com and I'll let you know what my doc says!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little. At least you know you're not alone in this!

N4LfMUZOaa	I smoked for eleven years, and this will be my 5th cigarette free year without one relapse.The secret, resolve. You can not promise that you won't ever smoke again, you take one day at a time and focus on being successful that day. I never used any gum patch or pill, i just made up my mind that i was not going to smoke anymore. I resolved not to smoke as a favor to myself.It is still hard every day, and I know I could pick right back up today and smoke again, but i make a conscious decision not to.

AA10064223	buy her a mirror.|`|AA10244558	If you force people to live together for long enough they will get on each others' nerves.  But siblings are especially quarrelsome because they are always vying with each other for the parents' attention.  Whereas male sibling rivalry more often escalates into physical violence, female rivalry tends to stay verbal, but becomes far emotionally hurtful as a result.<br>  <br>  Part of the getting on each other's nerves part is taking out frustrations at other problems on each other.  It's possible, in fact probable, that your sister is angry at some situation completely external to you, and her calling you fat has no bearing on you as a person.<br>  <br>  When you grow up and move out of the house, your sister and you will get along better.  For now, just give her as much space as you can.  You'll find you're not in each others' faces as much when you're away from each other more.|`|AA12216490	Not all sisters are mean!!! I have a younger brother and sister that i love very much and I'd always be there for them. And, yes, sometimes i do say mean things when I'm mad at them but i don't mean what i say ever!!

AA11686559	My guess is you are suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  It's caused by stress, dehydration and poor eating habits. (Either one of those things or all of them combined).  It helps if I keep well hydrated, stay away from high fat foods and take a probiotic in the morning. Fiber helps as well.|`|AA10064223	I recommend:<br>  Avoid drinking with straws.<br>  Avoid sodas.<br>  Remember that cauliflower, broccoli and other veggies of this family cause more bloating. you can avoid them when you already feel bad.<br>  Beans are special to cause bloating. so you can also reduce quantities or avoid them if you already feel wrong.<br>  <br>  I recommend you eating veggies, but if you cook them it's better.<br>  Fruits: watermelon and cantaloupe can cause problems. Again reduce or avoid. <br>  Check out for milk. Try 1 or 2 days with lactose free milk. and see if bloating is reduced.<br>  <br>  As always, drink plenty of water, do exercise. Reduce fried food.<br>  And if besides the fact of gas discomforting if you feel pain, you can tell your doctor so he can prescribe medicine.|`|AA10857520	try taking 3 tsps of blackstrap molasses a day.It helps my ibs<br>  good luck

f57ad08639bb36f9ca924f7bef826c42aa	30 to 60 days depending on your percentage of body fat.  THC tends to reside in fatty tissue.  You can test yourself with a kit that you can buy over the counter in most drug stores for around $20.  I would suggest checking yourself that way after 30 days.  There are natural products that may speed up the cleansing process.  Golden Seal Root and Milk Thistle are natural blood and liver cleansers.|`|601310caff41fe16b3aac9e17088b570aa	24-48 hours, and you should drink alot of fluids to make you go to the bathroom, this will flush the pot out of your system. I know this because my deceased brother smoked it. If you're on probation I would not be smoking it, because they can test you anytime they want to.|`|AA11162641	Somebody told me that they were still testing positive many days afterward. It depends on the length of time you have smoked and the amount ingested daily evidently.|`|88d417c06b881633c7640f211bce43c9aa	it takes 28 days for it to leave your body used vinger|`|AA10570281	naturally-isn't it like a week?

Fortunately, most people don't have to go through a hair folicle drug test.|`|985a7eaa94e60a2c7b1c05dd9f6c81daaa	30 days depending on the amount smoked....If you smoked only a joint or two, it could take only a couple of weeks but if you smoked alot it could take a month or more.  If you need to clear your system quickly go to your drug store and buy some antioxidents or system flushing pills.  Also drink LOTS of water!!!!!!|`|AA10875162	it all depends on how much you use and your metabolism, it could take 5 days or 45 days.
