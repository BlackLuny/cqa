829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	The best oatmeal is McCann's "Steel" cut ( the one in the white can or box).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mccanns.ie/p_SteelCut.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mccanns.ie/p_SteelCut.html</a>|`|kMK9E2a7aa	I'm from Scotland. I've eaten oats all my life. As a kid we would eat porridge hot & cold. We used to mix just ordinary rolled oats with cocoa powder and brown sugar for a midday snack. I now eat homemade muesli with real oats for breakfast. It is the healthiest food for keeping your cholesterol under control.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Back in my homeland, we would toast whole grains of every description - sometimes mixed, sometimes not - and then soak them in juice or milk overnight. In the morning we'd cook them in their liquid, adding more if necessary. So you're not just limited to oatmeal. You can do that with rye berries, bulgur, amaranth - anything, really. Just add fruit or honey or molasses - whatever you like. It's healthy, you control what goes in it and it's very filling.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Try steel cut oatmeal.  My kids wont touch the instant now, so that says a lot.  If you want one that has no preservatives, shop whole foods and see what they have.  Steel cut is more like a whole grain, so its not flat, like instant, and I found that I crave it now, in the mornings.  I add dried fruit to it, so that I dont need sugar too.  Good luck.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	Quaker oatmeal...bigggg version. ..orginal<br>  Good luck!<br>  i eat this all the time|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I agree with that other person.<br>  Steel cut is best.|`|ifIRySXpaa	Make your own! That is the best thing you can do! What I do is make a mixture of the types of oats I have at the time (oat bran, quick rolled oats, regular rolled oats, steel cut oats) usually oat bran with quick cooking rolled oats, add a pinch of sea salt, and get some water very hot over the stove and throw in some minced fruit like strawberries or peaches or apples for a few seconds, then pour it onto the oatmeal mix (for the popular apple & cinnamon flavor, just add cinnamon spice after you've poured the water/fruits). It's quick, easy to make and super tasty and you don't have to deal with all the chemicals and sweeteners put in the colorful packages of poison found in the aisles of grocery stores. You don't need sugar because the fruits are sweet on their own. But you don't have to add fruits either. Just oat bran and sea salt can be pleasant but you might have to put a little more sea salt than if you had fruits if your tastebuds aren't used to "healthy eating" yet. Oh and it's best if these are organic. Most grocery stores carry oats in varieties, but for organic ones and sometimes steel cut oats, as well as organic fruits, try the health food stores and farmers markets.<br>  <br>  So, easily put: oat bran, rolled oats, sea salt, minced fruit, hot water =)<br>  <br>  If you want to learn of more recipes and tips on eating healthy and making smart food choices, visit my blog <br>  <a href="http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/." rel="nofollow">http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/.</a> You can add your own tips and recipes as well.

44b90c053b01c2794d2454eb16fcbea1aa	Core the head of cabbage, and place it in a pot of boiling water. As the outer leaves soften a bit, you can pick them off with a pair of tongs. Keep picking them off and let them cool a bit before filling. You're not cooking the cabbage completely...just "blanching".<br>  <br>  Another tip....trim the stem a little before filling to make your leaves easier to roll.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I made those last week:) .....  Push the cabbage down on the counter to loosen the core; and then pull it out.  Then I let the cabbage sit in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes.  The leaves softened up so that you could peel them off, and roll them around the meat.  You certainly don't want to COOK the cabbage first, since you'll be cooking the stuffed cabbage later|`|ylJoUuMDaa	You have to cook that cabbage a little or the leaves will crack when you try and roll them.  Take out as much of the core as you can dig out with a sharp knife.  Put the cabbage upside down in water and bring to a boil.  Boil for 10-12 minutes.  The leaves will then come off easily.  Rinse under cold water well because the inside stays very hot.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Try steaming the entire head of cabbage before using.  It makes the leaves pliable for making rolls.  <br>  Don't over steam it, just enough for the pliability factor.|`|9CN0otoQaa	I cut the stem out of the head of cabbage, then steam it slightly until it's a little soft and easy to remove the leaves.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	I am in agreement with the other posters.  Cook the whole head of cabbage and then core.|`|fs8BFZAzaa	cut around the core of the head of cabbage and remove it this will allow you to remove the leaves easily<br>  <br>  also its easier to roll the leaves if you have cooked the whole head of cabbage in water before hand|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I cut around the core or butt of the cabbage, take a knife and hit it lightly, be careful not to cut yourself , then you can wash the leaves|`|GAVYUZy5aa	I usually just pull them off, but you can also just simply cut them with a knife.

Soup is one of the perfect things to make in a crock pot. And being a vegetarian, you can add a lot of veggies packed with nutrients to re-energize you (just as a recommendation, carrots, celery, green beans, onions, peppers work good in a soup); also, adding potatoes is good, adding beans and/or lentils packs in even more nutrients. <br>  <br>  Here are some additional vegetarian crock pot recipes for you to browse through: <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes/vegetarian,crockpot" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes/vegeta...</a><br>  <br>  Additionally, on a Sunday night you could make your own pizza and load it up with veggies (spinach, artichokes, peppers), and then you've got leftovers for a few days.<br>  <br>  If you like eggs, I would even recommend hard-boiling some in advance so you can grab one or two for a between meal snack, or to just toss on a salad.

5qC22Xvuaa	A house doesn't have to be a big for an awesome party. It's cool that you have a park right across, but if you just let ppl go there and do whatever you want, that's not going to be much fun. Maybe you could talk to the manager of the park and maybe decorate the park a little and have the party there. I'm not sure they would let you do that, but you should definitely try. The sunroom idea sounds really awesome! You should decide on a theme, like maybe a color scheme. <a href="http://party.lovetoknow.com/Teen_Party" rel="nofollow">http://party.lovetoknow.com/Teen_Party</a> Here's a website that may help you in your party planning.

mPLXUorTaa	You can't base how healthy something is based on calories.  A 100 calorie banana is a lot better for you than a 100 calories worth of cookies.  Bananas have a lot of good nutrients, especially potassium, vitamin b6, fiber, and vitamin c.  They also make you feel more full, so you don't want to overeat.  100-200 calories is really not so bad for a snack, especially for something so good for you.  I usually eat a couple bananas a day, and I've done that since I was a kid.|`|AA11620976	What's unhealthy here is your attitude towards good wholesome nutritious food.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Potassium and fiber|`|AA11402528	are you serious?.. whats 100 calories out of like 2000? plus its a fruit..<br>  <br>  your going over-board with the calorie counting there..|`|FTSWrSHPaa	There is so much more to nutrition than calories. Counting exactly how many calories you eat is really only necessary if you have a weight problem. Bananas are an excellent source of potassium and are great to include in breakfast (which is supposed to be the biggest meal of the day, anyway) if you don't have a lot of time but need energy for the day. The biggest thing to remember is not to eat too many in a day because it can cause digestion problems.|`|GfMTp3Woaa	calories do not distinguish how healthy a food is.<br>  bananas are loaded with vitamin C and lots of potassium!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!|`|C8u2jBu7aa	calories have very little to do with nutrition. just think, there are many condiments that have little or no calories. there are food items with hundreds of calories(mcdonalds) calories measure the amount of potential energy stored in the item, not any of the vitamins or minerals. the reason bananas have so many calories is the sugars in them.|`|CblODn2Kaa	They have calories, but they also have huge amounts of nutrients in them. Just because something doesn't have a lot of calories, doesn't  mean it's automatically good for you. Don't let the calories scare you away, bananas are really healthy.

If you are very concerned you could take a supplement (vitamin).|`|l1UwQRBTaa	I dont like milk either, buy having chocolate milk is still good for you.<br>  Try smoothies, eat ice cream, milk sauces, such as cheese sauce and stuff on foods.<br>  <br>  Eat dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt, ice cream...|`|pESnImBLaa	you can get protein from these chewy things from walmart target the come in chocolate and strawberry|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Cheese.

clTQhB9qaa	Hello,<br>  I'm a vegetarian.<br>  I've been for a few months now.<br>  I absolutely enjoy it :D.<br>  Anyways...it's a good choice to make in my opinion.<br>  Depends on what kind you want to become.<br>  I'm just a simple vegetarian. I eat everything but meat.<br>  So for example if you choose to become that, you can basically eat anything but meat.<br>  Nothing that has any animal meat in it, or anything that needed to kill an animal to make it.<br>  You'd be surprised how much stuff has animal meat in it!<br>  Basically a website that helped me when I went out to eat and stuff, was <a href="http://www.vegetarian-restaurants.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegetarian-restaurants.net</a><br>  It's a very helpful website! Check it out!<br>  It's great...if you have any questions or anything, feel free to email me at samchick995@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Marshmallows, Skittles, and other things with gelatin.

Some vegetarians aren't picky about it though.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Vegetarianism isn't as limiting as some people think it is.  In fact my diet has broadened since becoming veg, because I was no longer caught up in "traditional" ways of looking at food and I realized how much is out there.  I eat Indian food, sushi (there is a ton of options that don't include fish) a wide variety of veggies and fruits.  <br>  <br>  If you're wanting to go lacto-ovo vegetarian then you can still eat dairy and eggs.  You only need to cut out meat (beef, pork, chicken, seafood, etc) and slaughter bi-products.  The hardest part is the beginning, figuring out what to avoid.  McDonald's fries, for example, have beef fat in them (e-mail the company if you don't believe me) Some Hostess products also have beef fat in them.  Some cheeses are made with rennet, a chemical from the stomach lining of calves.  There is lard, of course.  The hardest thing to avoid is gelatin.  It's in many candies (Starbursts, Skittles, gummy candies, JrMints, etc) Jello, marshmallows (though marshmallow fluff is safe for vegetarians) many yogurts and some soups.<br>  <br>  Id recommend going to the bookstore and browsing the vegetarian cookbooks - there are a ton.  Pick up one or two that look good.|`|5oEJuhwiaa	what kind of vegetarian are you becoming?<br>  <br>  Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian: you can eat anything except meat.

jZRtTpZiaa	It's your parents couch, not yours.  isn't it?  When you buy a couch for yourself,  buy a non-leather one.   The sad fact is that most furniture has all kinds of fire retardants and other materials in them that have been tested on animals anyway.   The best you could do if you owned your own leather couch that you bought before going veg, and it bothered you,  is to throw a nice cover over it.  It's not a big deal because you personally have stopped consuming animal products, and you're not demanding more of them. <br>  <br>  More killing occurs in the dairy industry than to make that couch.  If you're going to feel guilty about anything,  feel guilty about that.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	No, what's done is done. What you could do is tell them how you feel about leather and encourage them to buy synthetics in the future. I still have a leather jacket that I wear, because I bought it years ago before I learned that animals are skinned alive. But I don't BUY leather anymore.|`|9ilXVowLaa	you didn't pick it out or pay for it.<br>  furniture is pricey.<br>  just don't sit on it,and don't feel guilty.<br>  <br>  peace|`|2zHq2XIMaa	No, I am a similar position. My parents bought a leather couch 5 years ago, I became vegan 2 years ago. It never occurred to me when I was 13 that the couch would be real or fake leather or to think how it was made. I would not try to get them to buy a new one as we have already got this one and it would be wasteful to throw away. I do not buy leather anymore but that doesn't mean that I will throw away all my leather  clothing(not much anyway) regardless, because it would be a waste, damage is already done, I bought it I have worn them and will continue to wear them until they wear out and then I will buy new faux leather clothing. I don't like sitting on the leather couch, and I don't often but it does not compromise your vegetarianism. Avoid if if you need to, just know that you are not contributing to the cruelty, it was not your decision, and it was not made aware to you at the time, what it was made from or how it was made, and if it was, you are older now, and you are more aware of what is happening so you just don't buy leather now.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|UM8EFzIMaa	Vegetarianism is a diet.

ozWi3TJlaa	Here are two recipes, both of which I have used, and both are delicious:<br>  <br>  Rack of Lamb with parsley and garlic crust <br>  Ingredients<br>  2 single racks of lamb, frenched<br>  2 Tablespoons unsalted butter<br>  2 large garlic cloves, very finely chopped<br>  1/4 cup finely chopped parsley (curly)<br>  1/4 cup dry bread crumbs<br>  3 Tablespoons Dijon mustard<br>  salt & freshly ground pepper<br>  Preheat oven to 450°F.<br>  1. Season the lamb with salt and freshly ground pepper.<br>  2. Heat the butter in a nonstick skillet over med-high heat.<br>  3. Sear the top of the meat until light golden. Remove from pan, but do not discard the butter.<br>  4. Add the garlic and parsley to the pan and toss for 1-2 minutes.<br>  5. Mix in the breadcrumbs, remove from heat and allow to cool in the pan.<br>  6. Brush each rack with 1-1/2 Tablespoons of the mustard.<br>  7. Spread the prepared topping equally over the two racks.<br>  8. Set the racks in a roasting pan, and turn the oven down to 400°F. Roast until meat thermometer registers 120°F. (20-25 minutes). <br>  To serve:  Allow the rack to rest until the internal temperature has reached 130°F. Then slice between the ribs. This is a traditional Easter dish that is served with tiny green beans and butter fried potatoes.<br>  <br>  <br>  RACK OF LAMB WITH HERB CRUST?<br>  1 rack of lamb<br>  1 c. white bread crumbs<br>  1/2 c. finely chopped parsley<br>  1 clove garlic, minced<br>  2 tbsp. Dijon mustard<br>  2 tbsp. olive oil<br>  1 tsp. salt<br>  Freshly ground pepper to taste<br>  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Trim the lamb, leaving the rib bones as long as possible. Leave about 1/4 inch of fat on the outside of the rack. Cut criss crosses in the fat. Combine all of the remaining ingredients. Put the lamb in a roasting pan and cook it in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the lamb and reduce heat to 375 degrees. Pat the bread crumb mixture on top of the rack and on the bony side to form a crust. Return to the oven for another 15 minutes. The lamb should be served very pink.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Look at this site first and watch the video:<br>  <a href="http://www.videojug.com/search?keywords=rack+of%20lamb" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/search?keywords=...</a>|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	Where I am you can buy it with seasoning already, just cook it like it says. It is also easy to just put some rosemary on it, and have mint sauce with it (mix balsamic vinegar, sugar and mint to taste and heat it until it is the thickness/quantity you want).

The cooking time is something I unfortunately don't remember, because it hasn't been on the wrapper of the ones I buy anymore, but like 425 for a bit to brown the outside and then 375 for 20-30 min more.|`|tc610Rztaa	If you aren't an accomplished cook, and would like to know how to cook it well and simply I recommend you watch the episode of "good eats" called the 'alton crown affair'<br>  <br>  I have included the links below.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJBToUj15Nw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJBToUj15...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJBToUj15Nw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJBToUj15...</a>

hT7BhNamaa	Hey Death Trap, a good chicken soup is one you really don't need to put a lot into, and you can use chicken carcass, I pick up carcass from fifty cents to a dollar max, if I don't have a carcass, or you can use turkey wings pick those up for about seventy five cents each.<br>  <br>  In a pot, I half fill, and add the cut of poultry I have, chopped onion, couple of bay leaves, chicken stock cube, two sticks of celery chopped, two carrots peeled and chopped, one parsnip peeled and chopped, freshly ground black pepper, I don't add salt at this stage.<br>  <br>  I add more water and bring to the boil for ten minutes and then turn the heat down to medium for 15 minutes and simmer after for another 30 minutes. At this stage I taste the broth if it needs more seasoning to your taste go ahead, but be cautious how much you put in. At this stage what ever meat is on the bone should be falling off, you can remove the bone, and add your noodles. Once noodles are cooked, serve, I am sure you will go for seconds or thirds.<br>  <br>  Death trap if you have any soup left over, strain the broth into containers and freeze, you will have stock on hand for other recipes.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|qof2d5ujaa	the kind with two chicken legs popping out of it, claws intact|`|8sBy8OHQaa	Yum|`|fAcVndo7aa	Cut up some chicken breast into small cubes - you want about a cup.  Cook the chicken in a little bit of oil over medium-high heat - like stir-frying it - until it's done all the way through the cubes (it only takes a couple minutes).  Add about 4 cups of chicken broth or stock, 3-4 sliced carrots, and 2-3 chopped stalks of celery.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil.  When it boils, add 1 cup of uncooked egg noodles and lower the heat to medium.  Simmer the soup until the noodles are tender - 10-15 minutes.  Quick and easy.  <br>  <br>  I have more complicated ones, but this one is so simple, it's my go-to recipe.

lcuxD3qlaa	Gelatin is a common ingredient in foods because it is so versatile. It can be used as a gelling agent (as in Jell-O), as a thickener, an emulsifier, and a stabilizer. You'll find it in a variety of foods, from yogurt to chewing gum. Here is a list of some other foods that commonly contain gelatin:<br>  <br>  * gummy bears<br>  * sour cream<br>  * cream cheese<br>  * cake icing and frosting<br>  * marshmallows<br>  * soups, sauces and gravies<br>  * canned ham and chicken<br>  * corned beef<br>  * sausage <br>  <br>  Gelatin is even used to make the coating for pills that makes them easier to swallow. It's also in cosmetics, lozenges, and ointments.<br>  <br>  When you buy a box of Jell-O (or another brand of gelatin) at the grocery store, you get a small packet of powdered gelatin with artificial flavorings and colors. At room temperature, the gelatin protein is in the form of a triple helix. This is a fairly ordered structure not unlike that of DNA. With DNA, two chains of nucleotides are twisted together in a spiral pattern. (To learn more about DNA, see How Cells Work). In the gelatin protein, there are three separate chains of amino acids (polypeptide chains) have lined up and twisted around each other, and the helix is held together by weak bonds that form between the amino acids that end up on the inside of the coiled structure<br>  <br>  Hopes this helps!|`|YXCDdDKIaa	here is one i bet you never thought of...<br>  <br>  Gelatin typically constitutes the shells of pharmaceutical capsules in order to make them easier to swallow. Hypromellose is a vegan-acceptable alternative to gelatin, but is more expensive to produce.

YXCDdDKIaa	Kosher Salt<br>  Kosher salt is regular salt that is so named for its use in the preparation of meat according to the requirements of Jewish dietary guidelines. It contains fewer additives, and has a more salty taste than ordinary table salt. It generally comes in flakes rather than granules. The flakes dissolve easily, and have a less pungent flavor than table salt. Due to the shape of the granules, there is simply less salt in a pinch of kosher salt than in a pinch of table salt. This is the kind of salt most often used on top of pretzels and on the rims of margarita glasses. It is important to note that all Kosher salt is not necessarily sea salt. Kosher salt comes in fine and coarse grain.<br>  <br>  Sea Salt<br>  Other Names: Sal Del Mar, Sel De Mer, Sale Marino<br>  <br>  Sea salt is a broad term that generally refers to unrefined salt derived directly from a living ocean or sea. It is harvested through channeling ocean water into large clay trays and allowing the sun and wind to evaporate it naturally. Manufacturers of sea salt typically do not refine sea salt as much as other kinds of salt, so it still contains traces of other minerals, including iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, manganese, zinc and iodine. Proponents of sea salt rave about its bright, pure, clean flavor, and about the subtleties lent to it by these other trace minerals. Some of the most common sources for sea salt include the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean (particularly in France, on the coast of Brittany). Sea salt is thought to be healthier and more flavorful that traditional table salt. Available in coarse, fine & extra fine grain size.<br>  <br>  <br>  Table Salt<br>  Table salt is the most common kind of salt found in the average kitchen. It usually comes from salt mines and once it's mined, it is refined and most minerals are removed from it until it is pure sodium chloride. Most table salt is available either plain or iodized. American salt manufacturers began iodizing salt in the 1920's, in cooperation with the government, after people in some parts of the country were found to be suffering from goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by an easily-preventable iodine deficiency. People require less than 225 micrograms of iodine a day. Seafood as well as sea salt contains iodine naturally and the supplement is unnecessary if there are sufficient quantities of either in one's diet. Note: Natural sea salt is a healthy replacement for ordinary table salt.<br>  <br>  <br>  try this site, there is alot more kinds of salt out there than you thought.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	They differ in a few ways:<br>  <br>  Size:  Sea and Kosher salt are larger crystals and take longer to dissolve.  So if you need the salt to dissolve, like in a soup or cookie dough - then you want to use regular table salt which is much finer and will dissolve readily.<br>  <br>  Taste: Sea Salt often has other minerals in it which give it a color.  This changes the flavor just a bit and can be a great improvement in recipes.    Sea salt is generally added to the outside of foods, not mixed in.<br>  <br>  Sodium level:  Depending on how much other minerals are in sea salt, it may have a slightly lower sodium content than either Kosher or table salt.  Read the label to check.<br>  <br>  So the rule of thumb is - if it is supposed to dissolve in the dish - use table salt.  If you are putting it on top of the food like for grilled meats - use Kosher Salt or Sea Salt for eye appeal and additional flavor.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Looks like girlie girl has all the answers.  In addition, table salt has something added to it to prevent clumping.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Sea salt has more nutrients than regular salt and is healthier.

Of course you have size and gender. It also depends on what that person ate. Someone drinking on an empty stomach is gonna get drunk a lot faster than someone who just ate a full meal.

xrRZeROmaa	Even in vegetarian circles, mushrooms are not listed among the high protein substitutes for recipes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tryveg.com/cfi/toc/?v=08sourc..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tryveg.com/cfi/toc/?v=08sourc...</a><br>  <br>  Mushrooms are low caloric intake, containing about 1 gram of protein per 20 calories, or 85 grams of actual mushroom.  85 grams is the equivalent to 5 button or brown mushrooms, or one large portabello.<br>  <br>  Shitake mushrooms are the most common mushroom containing more protein, and have approximately 2.6 grams of protein per 20 calories, almost 3 times higher than other mushrooms, but still well below standards for a meat replacement, even for vegetarians.  <br>  <br>  Mushrooms are used as a replacement for meat, simply for the flavor value.  They have a pleasant flavor of their own, and will take on the flavor of whatever they are cooked with.  Add that to the low caloric intake, and you have your answer.|`|AA11786341	The idea of a low-calorie diet is to choose foods with high water content, high fiber content, or a low fat content. Vegetables and fruit, including fresh mushrooms, fit that bill. Selecting foods with low-energy-density means you can have more of them without consuming large amounts of excess calories that can lead to weight gain. <br>  <br>  Studies show that consistently choosing foods with low-energy-density, including fresh mushrooms, results in a better quality diet.  The diet also has greater variety but fewer calories than a high-energy-dense diet, typically made up of more processed foods, baked goods, fried foods, snacks and high-calorie beverages such as alcohol and soft drinks.  <br>  <br>  Researchers at Pennsylvania State University confirmed that people who eat a low-energy-dense diet consumed fewer calories, less fat and had higher intakes of several important micronutrients including vitamins A, C, and B6, folate, iron, calcium and potassium.9  Of note, those with a low-energy-dense diet also consumed fewer beverages other than water, such as carbonated beverages that provide excess calories but few nutrients. <br>  Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition looked at the effect of lowering the energy density of specific portion sizes.  They found that advising people to eat satisfying portions of low-energy-dense foods was a more successful weight loss strategy than fat reduction coupled with restrictions of portion sizes.10  In fact, the dietary changes made by the low-energy-dense group included significantly more vegetables and fruit and a 40% greater weight loss after 6 months than those advised to limit portions of all foods and to reduce fat intake.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Jess, Are you looking at vegetarian cook book's? some of the web sites, have a mixture of normal recipes and vegetarian.

They have nearly the same texture & flavor as meat then.  But button mushrooms don't serve the same purpose; and don't have the protein that meat has.   You can substitute legumes, cheese, or tofu for meat to get the protein you need though (and those are cheaper per pound than mushrooms)|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I think it's for texture, but I agree, you cannot replace something just because it is similar without considering the nutrition. Apparently mushrooms do have some protein (3g for 100g) so it's probably not that bad of a switch, especially considering they are lower in fat.

zzkmdusEaa	Yes I do.<br>  <br>  From personal experience.<br>  <br>  When you are intoxicated...You tend to say things without thinking. It's like spontaneously blurting out your thoughts. When you are of a sober mind you can think logically and ponder the consequences of saying things you thought. When of a drunken state however, consequences don't seem to be much of a worry.<br>  <br>  Sleeping with people who you wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole is also an example of how bad alchohol can cloud up reality for you. I've learned the hard way that if your feeling down and go out drinking and some woman who is talking to you that doesn't seem all that good looking to you..Give her the no before you get drunk.....The more you drink the hotter they get and before you know it you are in for a remorseful morning.|`|vjgsbhP3aa	Not really just some more bull myth. I will tell you I want to eat your babies when I am drunk.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Alcohol, as you know, is a drug.<br>  <br>  One side effect:  Loosens inhibitions.  This includes the mouth.  British Parliamentarians truly believed that good parliamentary discussions needed to be presaged by a jolly round of drinks.  Probably why they serve drinks at gatherings.<br>  <br>  Another side effect:  <br>  Opens up the imagination.  While Edgar Allan Poe is routinely held up as a model of a drunk author, one could argue that talent has to be somewhere inside that mind first. It was just waiting to be released.  We have millions of drunks yet only one Edgar Allan Poe.<br>  <br>  Similarly, your sleeping with certain people example probably occurs only when the sober sleeper already had some intention in there.  The act broke free when the inhibition, and yes the judgment, broke free.<br>  <br>  How else would a "2" at 10PM when you entered the bar turn into a "10" at 2AM?<br>  <br>  Of course, you do have to distinguish among the various levels of intoxication.  There's the pleasant light buzz one the one hand but then there's total blackout on the other.  Sort of like there's Aunt Minnie the witty hostess then there's Uncle Bruno who always needs to be quietly dragged out of the party while he still has on most of his clothes.<br>  .<br>  .|`|n7uF90t3aa	I think that normally people have a lot of stuff going on in their head.  Sober people are able to think things through and reach their logical conclusion- i.e., "Jake is cute.  But I shouldn't think of him that way because he's dating my best friend."  Drunk people lose the ability to think things through, so the thought "Jake is cute" just plays in their head over and over again.  Plus, I agree about there being no edit button.  So I guess drunk thoughts can overlap with sober thoughts, but they're usually worse & less complete than sober thoughts?<br>  <br>  "always do sober, what you said you would do drunk.  that will teach you to keep your mouth shut."|`|IuP0ryOMaa	sometimes being drunk makes your edit button go away  lol.  But over all, I tend to do and say things I don't mean when I am drunk.

But I make mine with the low fat cream cheese and egg substitutes and that helps a LOT!  I do use regular sour cream because it tastes funny with all low fat products and non-fat products don't give the right texture, they get rubbery.  You could use a sugar substitute if you're in to those; I'm not because they're too full of chemicals.  I just use less sugar; in most recipes you can reduce the amount of sugar by 1/2 and still get a good result.
AA12198711	These are two I always go by.<br>  <br>  <br>  Worlds Best Orange and Lemon Sponge Cake<br>  <br>  <br>  6 eggs (room temperature)<br>  1 cup sugar<br>  1 cup all purpose flour, sifted<br>  4 tbsp. grated orange peel, about<br>  2 tbsp. grated lemon peel<br>  2 tsp. vanilla<br>  <br>  In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar at high speed for about 10 minutes or until eggs have tripled in volume and are light and frothy.<br>  <br>  On low speed, beat in flour only until blended. Fold in orange, lemon and vanilla. Pour batter into an ungreased 10 inch tube pan and bake in a 350 F. oven for about 40 to 45 minutes, or until a cake tester, inserted in center, comes out clean. Do not over-bake. Remove from the oven, INVERT, and allow to cool. (If your tube pan does not have the three little legs for inverting, you must invert cake over the neck of a large size soda bottle.)<br>  <br>  When cool, remove from pan and serve with fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream. It can also be served with a faint sprinkling of sifted powdered sugar. Serves 10.<br>  <br>  NOTE: DO NOT Under-beat the eggs or cake will lose volume. If your mixer does not have a very low and gentle setting, then fold in the flour by hand.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hot Milk Sponge Cake<br>  <br>  4 eggs<br>  2 cups all-purpose flour (sift before measuring)<br>  2 teaspoons baking powder<br>  1/2 teaspoon salt<br>  1/2 cup (1 stick) butter<br>  1 cup milk<br>  2 cups granulated sugar<br>  1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (or 1/2 teaspoon each vanilla and lemon extracts)<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350° F. Lightly spray two (9-inch) round cake pans with vegetable oil spray and line the bottom with parchment paper.<br>  <br>  Cover the eggs (still in their shell) with hot tap water. Allow eggs to sit for at least five minutes to warm them up. NOTE: It is important that the eggs be warm to the touch when they are whipped with the sugar. This gives an extra lightness to the cake. See Lagniappe below.<br>  <br>  In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.<br>  <br>  In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the milk and heat until the mixture is steaming. Remove from heat.<br>  <br>  Into a large mixing bowl, crack the warm whole eggs. Using an electric mixer, whip the eggs until frothy. Gradually add the sugar and whip on high speed until the batter is light and thick. NOTE: This takes a good ten minutes.<br>  <br>  Turn the mixer down to low and add the sifted dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt).  Mix just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the egg batter, stopping once to scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Add the scalded milk and butter mixture. Mix on low speed until the batter is smooth, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the vanilla extract and continue mixing on low just until the vanilla is incorporated into the batter. Divide the batter equally into each prepared cake pan. NOTE: The batter will be quite thin so don’t be alarmed.<br>  <br>  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until the cake is golden brown and springy to the touch. Remove from oven and place the cake layers on a wire cooling rack. Sprinkle each layer very lightly with granulated sugar. Leave the cake layers in the pan to cool for thirty minutes. When cool, carefully run a paring knife around the edge of the each cake layer, using an up and down motion, to avoid tearing the sides of the cake. Turn the layers out onto a wire cooling rack. Cool completing before serving.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Findd your own recipe then.

EMDNVrcjaa	Watch how to make a toga from the first website or read about how to make it below.<br>  <br>  College life: how to make a toga<br>  Toga parties are still popular on college campuses, but putting together a proper costume takes planning. Here's how to make a basic toga with minimal fuss.<br>  <br>  Popularized by the movie Animal House, toga parties are still a part of the social scene at many colleges and universities. Party-goers dress in homemade togas and dance to popular golden oldies and classic R&B tunes. The highlight of most toga parties is a free-for-all dance as the band or DJ plays the Isley Brothers classic song "Shout". Toga parties are not meant to be Roman-themed events, but simply an excuse for college students to celebrate the end of a long week of studies or the last gasps of finals.<br>  <br>  If you're ever invited to a college toga party, creating the right costume can be important. A classic Roman toga was often constructed from fine linens and carefully decorated, but today's togas are generally made from bed sheets and held together with cheap belts or ties. Here's how to make a toga from readily available materials and with minimal sewing skills required:<br>  <br>  1. Most Roman togas contain two separate pieces- the inner tunic and the outside toga. The tunic is a simple piece of material which covered the wearer from the neck to the knees. It was generally made from cheaper linen and could be worn by itself in private. The outer toga was often constructed from finer fabrics, which were dyed and custom-fitted. In general, the outer toga was arranged to drape around the torso and waist, then thrown across one shoulder and secured in the back. This is the basic Roman toga you'll be making.<br>  <br>  2. Find an old bedsheet or length of cotton material. You'll be cutting and possibly sewing this fabric, so you don't want to use a good sheet for a tunic. A tunic is supposed to be very simple, so don't worry about adding decorations or elaborate hems. The fabric needs to be long enough to reach from the neck to the knees after being folded once. If you have excess material, carefully trim it off with fabric scissors. The result should be a simple sheet folded in half.<br>  <br>  Find the center of the fold and designate a small semi-circle across the front with a laundry pen or permanent marker. Carefully trim both layers of fabric along the line and remove the circle of material left behind. This will be the hole for your neck eventually. You may need to adjust this hole for comfort, but it should remain just large enough to allow your head to fit through the sheet with minimal effort. If you're comfortable with a sewing machine, you can also add some ribbon or decorative trim around the neckhole for contrast and security.<br>  <br>  3. Place your head through the hole and allow the fabric to drape naturally. The top end should extend a few inches past your shoulders and the bottom should be around your knees or mid-thigh. Once you've determined the length and width to be correct, you'll want to sew the sides together below the arms, ending near the waist. Use a very basis straight stitch on a machine, or a quick basting stitch by hand. None of this needs to be very elaborate, but the tunic needs some closure on both sides for personal appearance. Even a few well-place safety pins should provide enough closure to prevent overexposure.<br>  <br>  An old necktie or length of gold braiding can be used as a belt to secure the inner tunic to your body. You may also want to wear gym shorts or boxers under the tunic for additional protection-bikini underwear or standard briefs may not be appropriate for a mixed party. If time and money are a consideration, you might also wear a t-shirt in place of a proper tunic.<br>  <br>  4. The outer toga should not require much in the way of sewing, but it does need to be long enough to cover the shoulders, torso and legs. In general, you'll want a piece of material that drapes easily (cotton, muslin or linen, for example) and is around 3 or 4 yards in length. Start by wrapping the material 1 1/2 times around your waist and pin it securely. Throw the remaining material over one shoulder. Allow the fabric to drape. Take the excess material and tuck it into the back of the waistline. Again, pin this material securely. Continue to adjust the fabric until it covers any exposed areas and feels secure across the shoulder.<br>  <br>  5. Sandals would be the preferred footwear<br>  to accompany a toga, but some may prefer to go barefoot or wear standard tennis shoes for protection on the dance floor. The trick to a good toga is keeping it secure and arranging it to prevent accidental exposure. A well-crafted tunic could be worn by itself with the addition of some gold belting and decorative hems. It may be possible to fashion a complete toga from one large piece of material, but be prepared to use a belt and lots of pins in order to keep it secure. Women may wish to substitute a toga for a more Grecian look- a longer tunic and sheer material dra

There are so many things that are very yummy that don't include animal products not to mention how hot you will look and feel|`|PxJXJKCpaa	There are two schools of thought on being vegetarian.  One is for your health, the other is peer pressure.  One cannot live on ramon noodles, pringles, seeds and gatorade.  You will get very sick.  Even veg heads MUST eat protein.  The key to being healthy is doing research.  Just cutting out meats won't make you healthy if you still eat crappy.<br>  <br>  With or without going veg, you need to READ your packages and start buying "whole foods".  One carrot instead of a tube of pringles.  A baked potato instead of french fries.  Really, the first thing to a healthy lifestyle is cutting out Eating Out.  It's more expensive to eat healthy, but you can't be picky when it comes to your health and weight.<br>  <br>  I'm not telling you to, or not to become a veg, but if you don't eat properly, you WILL get sick.  I've tried diets all my life.  Fads come and go, but mainly are dangerous to the body.  Now, I'm not saying that being a veg head is a 'fad" diet, but you MUST have a larger variety of foods to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Your diet sucks, as does mine. (I'm severely underweight due to stress).  The wings are just fat and no one should eat them to begin with.  Dairy is good if you buy low fat cheese, yogurts, cottage cheeses and cream cheeses.  Eggs are fine as long as you don't fry them in oil or butter.  Ramon has too much salt as does pringles and the seeds.<br>  <br>  If you really want to become a veg head to try to loose weight, do your research on alternate sources of proteins.|`|m3eFscuqaa	If you just want to cut out meat, it's not that hard! You can do it!<br>  <br>  The trick is to take it in steps. For example, your first week you can cut out poultry (it sounds like you already have! Good job!) then the next you can remove pig, then the next cows, etc.<br>  <br>  It helps to have some supportive friends too. And if you get involved in cooking your own food, there are fantastic recipe resources on the internet (just google around!).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|y9tMWuQjaa	I just gave up meat a month ago.

jZRtTpZiaa	Hello,<br>  If you feel the need to use a multivitamin,  out of those two I would choose DEVA.  They are certified vegan by the original Vegan Society UK, and are one-a-day  whereas the other ones you have to take three.    Amazon.com has them in 2 packs cheaper, with free shipping if you spend over 25 bucks on items that qualify.<br>  <br>  I don't know a whole lot about the different brands as far as quality goes.  GNC did make one  vegetarian multivitamin that is not tested on animals.  I don't know if they still make them.   Deva's probably cheaper.<br>  <br>  I knew a girl who wanted to take a multi with extra iron because she bled heavily every month.  So she got the Deva prenatal vitamins even though she wasn't pregnant.  It has a bit extra iron.  I never compared the other ingredients.|`|afaAhlbGaa	If you are concerned it will not hurt you to take a vegan multivitamin tablet, though, if you use a vegan spread / cereals daily and they are fortified with vitamins b12 and d2 then you should be fine :)|`|jcL7gDMKaa	I know that Vegans lose out on Vitamin B12 so I would suggest Vegemite or Marmite yeast extract to compensate for that. you can get it in the supermarket, is great on toast!|`|AA12239026	I don't worry about the vitamin supplement issue since I get tested by my doctor on a regular basis and know for a fact I have no problems.  The only supplement that I take is B12 on the advice of my doctor, not because I have a problem, but to make sure that it never becomes a problem since once you find out there is a problem, the problem very well is not reversible.<br>  <br>  I have never seen anyone say anything negative about the vitamins that you are asking about.  If it were me, I would ask my doctor.  But if your not wanting to do that, then I would go with the one that gives you what it is that you feel that you might be lacking, since your the only one that knows what it is that you might be lacking (because you may not like certain foods, etc.) and the vitamin that approaches that area better than the other.

oVxr5B3Eaa	it depends on the type of people. If it's teenagers/guys, they are likely going to eat 2/3 of a pizza to themselves. If everyone is a little older, and a mix of girls and guys, i would say 1 large pizza per every 3 people.... so 5 in your case. Get 6 or 7 if you want to play it safe and like leftovers. <br>  I'm usually in charge of ordering pizza at lunch for work, and I find most of the women will eat 1/4 of a pizza tops, men closer to 1/2.... Younger guys will eat an entire pizza or more to themselves if given the oppurtunity. One guy in my office was 19 and ate two full pizzas. I was NOT pleased becasue I only asked for 5 bucks from each person with the intention of having two pizza left over... There went my leftovers. <br>  <br>  <br>  Suggestion though... Pizza hut is expensive. Do you have Gino's Pizza where you live? (I'm not sure if it's only in ontario or canada.. but it could be other places too)... They have really good deals, cheap delivery.. Usually 6 pizzas, dipping sauce, tax and delivery costs around 50 dollars for me...It's good and it's pretty filling too so you can get away with less.|`|d0Fmrywiaa	if it's for a small child's party, I'd say 1 1/2 slice per child (not everyone is going to ask for 2nds) for kids over 6 probably allow 2 slices per child.

lheU07Rcaa	One meal that I love to make in the crock pot is BBQ chicken.  I take a frozen bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts (3 lbs), dump it in the crock pot with a bottle of BBQ sauce (I prefer Cattleman's), and heat on low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours.  By the time it's finished cooking, simply stirring the contents of the crock pot will cause the meat to shred.  I've also done this with pork roast.  I like to serve it on onion rolls with a salad.<br>  <br>  Another good recipe that only involves one dish is potato wedges and chicken tenderloin tossed in lemon juice, topped with your choice of seasonings (I think I used salt & pepper plus Italian seasoning), baked at about 375 until done.  The lemon juice is really key to producing a great flavor.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are a plethora of soups - chili, tomato bisque, potato soup, Italian wedding soup, Minestrone, clam/corn chowder, etc.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	NE Boiled dinner<br>  <br>  1 Corned Beef or<br>  1 Ham (shoulder not spiral)<br>  <br>  2 lbs of peeled chopped carrots<br>  <br>  4 lbs of potatoes (whole)<br>  <br>  4 onions (peeled but whole)<br>  <br>  1 cabbage (cored and quartered)<br>  <br>  Put the meat into a large pot (large enough to hold everything), cover with water and heat to boiling, then reduce heat and allow to simmer.<br>  <br>  For Ham <br>  <br>  Allow ham to simmer for about 15 mins then add the rest of the veggies to the pot and continue to cook on a simmer, covered until the potatoes are done.

NeTNnvSZaa	Yes you can use jolly ranchers or sour balls or any clear hard candy (old fashioned, not the sugar free types).<br>  <br>  We make stained glass cookies using these during the holidays.  Just pile the broken candy pieces into piles or if  you can make a frame that would be better and bake in the oven until the candy has melted.  Peel it off the foil after it cools.<br>  <br>  If you use the cheap generic sour balls (old tyme candy) they make a white one that melts clear or the light yellow comes out almost the same.|`|AA12198711	Candy Glass<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some recipes for candy glass:<br>  <br>  You need 1/2 cup of water, 1 3/4 cup of white sugar,1 tbsp. light corn syrup, and of coarse a grease like crisco or pam. Boil the water and then stir the syrup and sugar. SPRINKLE A LITTLE SALT INTO THE MIXTURE, then let boil for seven to eight min. Put the mixture on a cookie sheet. Let cool for about an hour. Without the salt, the glass looks a little shiny on camera.<br>  <br>  2 cups water<br>  1 cup white corn syrup<br>  3 1/2 cups sugar<br>  1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>  <br>  Mix ingredients then let it come to a boil. It will boil at 220 degrees. Let it go to 300 degrees and pour.<br>  <br>  7parts sugar, 3 parts corn syrup, 2 parts water. Heated to 225deg F according to the directions, although, I used white sugar and my candy started to carmelize at 180deg on my candy thermometer. I cooked it fairly fast, which someone said might be the problem with the color.<br>  Also, the original recipe says use brown sugar for brown glass. If you are going to use brown sugar you'll want to measure ingredients on a scale, brown sugar is not as dense as white sugar.<br>  Cook it, pour it out into a pan coated with non-stick spray, about 5-8mm thick.<br>  It looks fairly clear, like stained glass though... you can't see through it. This is especially good for shattering. (It does this really well!)<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't try to speed up the drying process, or the glass will explode.<br>  <br>  Have a cold glass of water beside your pot. After about 5min of cooking put a drop of the heated sugar solution in the water. If it makes a sound like glass breaking then its the right temperature, if it doesn't its not.<br>  <br>  If you would like to make a large sheet of candy glass, like, for instance, to make a window, pour the glass onto a large flat smooth surface, such as glass, plexiglass or formica, a bit larger than the size of window you are making.|`|DnFLR1wSaa	I agree with Bella...if you want to do a small amount it probably would be easiest to just melt down hard candy. I also have done this making stained glass window cookies, but i make mine on parchment paper because i find it is much easier to remove. You have to watch it very carefully so it doesn't burn, but other than that it is easy to do. I'm trying to think of a clear candy, though, that would make a good window...but can only think of colored ones. <br>     Also, I'm sure if you found a good recipe somebody here would help you with the math to cut it down to a smaller recipe (I love math- especially when it comes to food!).|`|2b7ErdOqaa	If worse comes to worse and no one gives you a recipe, keep in mind you can always use fruit ribbons - yellow colored.

YW74O9aNaa	Well I'm from India and we eat veg all the time. Here is one recipe that uses just veggies. I'mnot sure if anything like this is available in stores, as i always cook it at home and its very easy. <br>  Grate veggies like carrots, ginger and garlic if you like it, cabbage etc. Boil potatoes, peel them and mash them. In a little oil saute the grated verggies. How long to saute depends on whether you want to cook all the way or like them a bit crunchy. Add these to the potatoes, you can add sweet peas / corn / cooked kidney orlima beans too if you like. <br>  <br>  Add a little cilantro, salt and pepper. Roll out shapes from this , dip them in breadcrumbs and then shallow fry. <br>  <br>  You can even eat these with ketchup /  salsa dip. <br>  They are very tasty and healthy! :)|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Her are some other choices:<br>  1. Yves Good Dog<br>  Yves wins the Golden Bun for the varieties of taste and texture offered in its products—whether you’re looking for a hearty hot dog or something on the lighter side, you’re sure to find it with Yves. Of its four flavors, the Good Dog made our mouths water the most. When you want to add chili, don’t forget the Hot and Spicy Veggie Chili Dogs, which are widely available and are the best grilling and pan-frying veggie dogs out there—their ability to crisp up can’t be beat! <br>  <br>  2. Lightlife Smart Dogs and Tofu Pups<br>  It was a close race with Yves, but Lightlife takes second place. The Lightlife dogs are tastiest when boiled or microwaved, and they’re especially yummy when topped with chili and chopped onions. Our judges preferred the Tofu Pups to the Smart Dogs. <br>  <br>  3. Worthington Big Franks<br>  Worthington Big Franks are the “beefiest” and best-tasting vegetarian hot dogs on the market, but they are not widely available. If you can find them, try them boiled—you won’t be disappointed!|`|Y5a3n1E6aa	I really enjoy eating Yves vegan dogs but I heard the yeast extract in there is a bad ingredient.

AA11767076	Yes!  They will be fine.  I asked my mom this once & she told me "an olive IS a vegetable" :)<br>  <br>  I use olive oil for everything, including brownies; they will be perfect.|`|lheU07Rcaa	I wouldn't really recommend it.  While olives are vegetables and one could technically say that olive oil is a type of vegetable oil, it's also true that olive oil has a distinct flavor that most people probably don't associate with brownies. <br>  <br>  It's possible that if you use a lower-grade olive oil, you won't have too much flavor interference.  Extra-virgin olive oil means that the batch of olives is being pressed for the first time, so you're getting the most flavor out of them.  Virgin olive oil is the second pressing, and it's still got a good amount of flavor.  My boyfriend successfully made brownies with fourth-press olive oil and while they weren't the greatest ever, they definitely satisfied the sweet tooth.|`|dd9559c1e59d3b44217363867d81b42baa	NO!<br>  It has nutty flavor in the mix.|`|AA11786341	they will be better for you!|`|gxBNoUXoaa	olive oil will not wot work. Use vegatable oil.|`|AA12198711	Sure, olive oil can be used in baking. But not for brownies. Have you ever tasted olive oil? Have you ever tasted brownies? They're not exactly on the same flavor wavelength. Technically, olive oil is considered a vegetable oil, as the broad category takes in oils from any plant source — nuts, seeds, legumes, or in the case of olives and corn, fruits. (In fact, at this moment, we can't think of any vegetable oil that actually comes from a vegetable....)<br>  <br>  But vegetable oil specified in brownie recipes generally means canola, corn, safflower, or sunflower oils, because they are essentially flavorless. There are some quite bland, highly-processed olive oils on the market — especially "light olive oil," which is not light in any dietary sense, but has been so thoroughly filtered that it has lost most of its color and fragrance. If you're bound and determined to use olive oil, you can try a light olive oil. But anything with more flavor is going to affect your brownies, and not in a good way.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	No, but  it can be used in baking. If you are determined to use olive oil when making brownies, you want to use "Light" Olive oil. Or else, use Canola oil.

K4rP4A0naa	A good guide to what the healthiest fruits and vegies are, are the ones with most intense colurs, eg: Blueberries. Other berries are good but these are the best. Sweet potatoes, spinach, broccoli, carrots, beets, kiwi fruit and guavas.<br>  <br>  Walnuts have the most nutrition of any nut. Things like flax seed and linseed are good. Soy products are very good for you and you can reduce calories by using wholemeal/brown version of bread and rice and pasta.<br>  <br>  Salmon would have to be more nutritious than tuna also.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Switch all of your bread, cereal and pasta products to whole grain versions. More fiber and makes you feel full. I was reading yesterday that the various types of fad diets (low/no carb, high protein, etc.) were not as good for long term weight loss as just learning to eat differently and that total calories in, calories out are what you should be looking at for weight loss. <br>  <br>  A friend of mine at work was quite heavy and lost a lot of weight (and has kept it off for over two years) simply by eating "backwards". She eats her largest meal of the day for breakfast, a medium meal for lunch and then a small meal, such as one would normally have for a weekday breakfast, for dinner. She snacks on fresh fruits and veggies in between - usually about twice a day.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't think of it as a diet!

geih5vR8aa	'tis a strange phenomena indeed. I don't know why that happens. I get that when I drink Sherry, red wines and port... although, I don't really take shots anymore.... so I can't remember if those made me feel warm. Usually, they're mixed with something, or I'm drinking beer.  I know Jager shots make me feel warm, even if it's been chilled.<br>  <br>  It's gotta be something else in these alcohols. You gotta keep a journal and report back here. Drink different alcohols, and write down which ones make you feel warm. Make sure you note if it's the first drink of the day, or the second, third or fourth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or it could be this:<br>  "Alcohol makes you feel warm because it irritates mucous membranes and sensitive skin. (Our insides are mucous membranes). It "burns". Try putting some on your nuts. Or up your nose." <br>  <br>  The certain types of alcohol you're drinking may be mixed with something that irritates your stomach when it first comes in contact with the alcohol. I found that quote from another site... so you can still do the research, and compare it to this.

If drunk quickly in large doses, alcohol from the vodka can poison your blood with acetaldehyde, causing anything from a hangover to death.  The caffeine from the Red Bull can cause dizzyness and shaking and upset the heart rhythm in susceptible people which could be dangerous.  Both alcohol and caffeine can dehydrate the body.

Better yet .99999999999999. You need to get infinitely close to 1.<br>  <br>  You can see where the function is going if you put in .9 and then .99, followed by .999, and then .9999. It becomes more obvious. You can also graph the function.<br>  <br>  It can be a tricky concept. The website below should only be used as a check.|`|7xbSG3lQaa	That's tricky. <br>  <br>  As x approaches 1 the equation will approach zero as 1 +2 -3 =0<br>  <br>  however, if you use .9 you get<br>  <br>  (.9^4 + 2 * .9 -3)/(.9^2 - 3(.9) +2)<br>  <br>  Which works out to -.4.9455<br>  <br>  If you use 1.1, the answer is -9.82<br>  <br>  The way to solve this is to solve the equation using a number that is extremely close to, but slightly less than, 1. Solve it again using a number that is extremely close to, but slightly above 1, and when the two results are similar you will have your answer. <br>  <br>  It is possible to have two different answers depending on which direction you approach one from. <br>  <br>  I would recommend some appelzner cheese to snack on while you solve the problem :)|`|Yw349A75aa	You posted in the wrong section, hon.

Refrigerate what is left over and consider using as a topping for potatoes or vegetables.<br>  <br>  1/2 cup clam juice<br>  1/2 cup dry sherry<br>  1/2 cup whole milk<br>  1 Tbsp minced garlic<br>  1 Tbsp minced shallots<br>  1/2 bay leaf<br>  1 Tbsp unsalted butter<br>  1 Tbsp flour<br>  3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  1 teaspoon white pepper<br>  1 Tbsp lemon juice<br>  <br>  Method<br>  Prepare the Sauce<br>  1 Reduce first six sauce ingredients (clam juice, sherry, whole milk, garlic, shallots, bay leaf) by half in a small saucepan. <br>  <br>  2 In a separate saucepan (1-qt minimum) prepare the roux. Heat one tablespoon of butter in the saucepan on medium heat until it is foamy. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (but not browned). <br>  <br>  3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate. When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up. Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.<br>  <br>  4 Lower the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Add some more clam stock if the sauce is too thick.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prepare the Fish<br>  <br>  1 Arrange an oven rack so that when the fish is on a baking pan in the oven it will be 4 to 5 inches from the heat. Preheat the oven to 350°F. <br>  <br>  2 Rinse the fillet in cold water, cut into 2 (1-pound) pieces. Remove any bones with fish-bone tweezers or (spotless clean) pliers. Lay out flat in a aluminum foil lined baking pan. Rub some olive oil over both sides of the pieces, enough to coat. Sprinkle both sides with a few shakes of salt and pepper. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until just done. To test, use the tip of a knife to gently cut into the thickest part of the fillet. The fish is done when the fish has just turned from translucent to opaque at the center. Once you pull the fish out of the oven it will continue to cook for a few minutes.

cab48877ab6eaba93e784ae3c030f08daa	Those are called Tapioca Pearls which is what tapioca is made from.<br>  <br>  Tapioca pudding is a common pudding with tapioca pearls added to a vanilla pudding. It can be discerned from other types of pudding by the small, translucent and almost caviar-like orbs of tapioca within. Tapioca is the root of the cassava plant, which is also known as manioc. It requires processing to withdraw either flakes, seeds or pearls of the tapioca plant. Tapioca is native to South and Central America. It is now produced in Africa and Asia.<br>  <br>  Tapioca has been considered a healthy food because, as a starch, it is easy to digest. In the eighteenth century it gained popularity for its nutritive properties. In the nineteenth century, tapioca pudding was often used as a medicine. In 1948, Jell-O produced three flavors of tapioca pudding: vanilla, chocolate, and orange-coconut.<br>  <br>  The pudding can be made with either tapioca flakes (tapioca sticks) or pearls, though the pearl version is preferred because it cooks faster. Hong Kong–style tapioca pudding consists of a baked egg custard mixture and thus is much harder than the vanilla variety. A common variation involves placing sweetened adzuki bean paste at the bottom.|`|158b81e930a49ab3e75b5418dd9ceb63aa	those small rounds bits are tapioca but its also made from starches.|`|ce3095f0c090fb2be3c0a645ae6966d2aa	My dad used to tell me they were 'froggy eyes'.

And, of course, patriotic <br>  music...<br>  <br>  Dishes are usually named with Nelson/Trafalgar connections, for <br>  example:<br>  <br>  +Starters<br>  Pickle Potage - cream and watercress soup<br>  Pate Villeneuve - pork pate with French toast<br>  <br>  +Fish course <br>  Trafalgar Duo - roulade of salmon and sole<br>  Cape Trafalgar Cod - baked cod topped with a breadcrumb crust<br>  <br>  +Main course<br>  It's got to be a traditional beef dish! <br>  Fleet Broadside - roast beef with all the trimmings<br>  Beef en Croute Napoleon - beef encased in pastry<br>  <br>  +Dessert<br>  Ships-of-the-Line - poached pears<br>  Lady Emma's Delight - trifle<br>  <br>  After the meal, port is drunk, always passed to the left. The toast to <br>  Nelson, "The Immortal Memory", is drunk standing, in total silence.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "Dinner with Admiral Lord Nelson" pack. %24.99<br>  A clever idea - all you need to organise a five-course dinner for <br>  eight - modernised eighteenth century recipes, 60 minutes of period <br>  music on CD, a pack of trivia questions, place cards, menus, <br>  invitations - and even a shopping list! The "boiled turbot with rich <br>  anchovy sauce" looks very enticing... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.navynewscatalogue.co.uk/acatalog/Classic_Dining_Set.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.navynewscatalogue.co.uk/acata...</a>|`|AA10631515	Here are some ideas from the Royal Naval Museum in Portsmouth.  Check their website for more information.<br>  <br>  Information Sheet NO. 109 <br>  TRAFALGAR NIGHT DINNERS<br>  <br>  The Battle of Trafalgar is usually celebrated by commissioned officers of the Royal Navy by holding a Trafalgar Night dinner in the Officer's Mess. Other interested parties also hold Trafalgar Night dinners in commemoration of the battle and Lord Nelson.<br>  <br>  There is no fixed menu for this occasion, but the following dishes can be used:<br>  <br>  Starters:      Breaking the Line  - Smoked salmon and lemon with capers    <br>  <br>                     Cannon Balls - Melon balls<br>  <br>                     Trafalgar Duo - Roulade of salmon and sole<br>  <br>  Main Course: Fleet Broadside - Beef Wellington with Port wine and shallots<br>  <br>                      Mizzen Main Course - Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding<br>  <br>  Dessert:       Victory Dessert or Dessert Hamilton - Poached pears<br>  <br>                     Hardy's Finale - Cheese and biscuits <br>  <br>  Coffee:        Carribean coffee and Gibraltar mints<br>  <br>  However, other dishes can be accommodated and named with Nelson/Trafalgar connections. It should be remembered that after the meal, port is usually drunk and passed to the left.<br>  <br>  The Loyal Toast: Diners should stand - unless the company are naval officers who are specifically authorised to remain seated. (see our information sheet on the Loyal Toast). The toast itself, by Royal decree, is "The Queen".<br>  <br>  The Immortal Memory toast: A Trafalgar Night speech is usually made by a guest of honour. If a speaker has not been arranged, the proposer of the toast will precede it with some Nelsonian comments, and can vary in length according to the custom of the diners. The toast itself is "The Immortal Memory" and is drunk standing in total silence. This is customary out of respect of the memory of the Admiral.<br>  <br>  There is no fixed music for such an occasion, but probably something of a patriotic nature could be used e.g. Rule Britannia<br>  <br>  (This fact sheet has been compiled with the kind assistance of the Nelson Society)<br>  <br>  <br>  ?

In everyday speech, shoots are often confused with stems. Stems, which are a critical component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, flowers or cones, fruits or seeds, and leaves. Stems are aboveground in many plants but some grow underground. The aerial stem of an adult tree is called a trunk. The dead, usually darker inner wood of a large diameter trunk is termed the heartwood. The outer, living wood is termed the sapwood. The main functions of aerial stems are<br>  <br>  Support and elevate leaves, flowers and fruits and keep leaves in the light. <br>  Transport of fluids between the roots and the shoots in the xylem and phloem. <br>  Storage of nutrients <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Specialized stems <br>  2 Stem structure <br>  2.1 Dicot stems <br>  2.2 Gymnosperm stems <br>  2.3 Monocot stems <br>  2.4 Fern stems <br>  3 Economic importance <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Specialized stems<br>  Stems are often specialized for storage, asexual reproduction, protection or photosynthesis, including the following:<br>  <br>  Bulb - a short vertical underground stem with fleshy storage leaves attached, e.g. onion, daffodil, tulip. Bulbs often function in reproduction by splitting to form new bulbs or producing small new bulbs termed bulblets. Bulbs are a combination of stem and leaves so may better be considered as leaves because the leaves make up the greater part. <br>  Cladophyll - a flattened stem that appears leaflike and is specialized for photosynthesis, e.g. asparagus, cactus pads. <br>  Corm - a short enlarged underground, storage stem, e.g. taro, crocus, gladiolus. Corms form many small cormlets. <br>  Rhizome - a horizontal underground stem that functions mainly in reproduction but also in storage, e.g. most ferns, iris <br>  Stolons or runner - is an aboveground, horizontal stem that produces rooted plantlets at its nodes, e.g. strawberry, spider plant. <br>  Thorns - a sharp, stiff modified stem that functions to prevent the plant from being grazed upon, e.g. honeylocust, hawthorn. Spines and prickles have a similar structure and function but are not modified stems. Spines are modified leaves orstipules, and prickles are outgrowths of the epidermis. <br>  Tuber - a swollen, underground storage stem adapted for storage and reproduction, e.g. potato. <br>  [edit]<br>  Stem structure<br>  Stem usually consist of three tissues, dermal tissue, ground tissue and vascular tissue. The dermal tissue covers the outer surface of the stem and usually functions to waterproof, protect and control gas exchange. The ground tissue usually consists mainly of parenchyma cells and fills in around the vascular tissue. It sometimes functions in photosynthesis. Vascular tissue provides long distance transport and structural support. Most or all ground tissue may be lost in woody stems. The dermal tissue of aquatic plants stems may lack the waterproofing found in aerial stems. The arrangement of the vascular tissues varies widely among plant species.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Dicot stems<br>  Dicot stems with primary growth have a pith in the center with vascular bundles in a distinct ring visible in cross section. The outside of the stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain stomata for gas exchange and hairs. A cortex of parenchyma cells lies between the epidermis and vascular bundles.<br>  <br>  Woody dicots and many nonwoody dicots have secondary growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects to form a continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely-packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.<br>  <br>  Secondary xylem is commercially important as wood. The seasonal variation in growth from the vascular cambium is what creates yearly tree rings in temperate climates. Tree rings are the basis of dendrochronology, which dates wooden objects and associated artifacts. Dendroclimatology is the use of tree rings as a record of past climates.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Gymnosperm stems<br>  All gymnosperms are woody plants. Their stems are similar in structure to woody dicots except that most gymnosperms produce only tracheids in their xylem, not the vessels found in dicots. Gymnosperm wood also often contains resin ducts. Woody dicots are called hardwoods, e.g. oak, maple and walnut. In contrast, softwoods are gymnosperms, such as pine, spruce and fir.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Monocot stems<br>  Vascular bundles are present throughout the monocot stem, although concentrated towards the outside. This differs from the monocot root that has a ring of vascular bundles and often none in the center. The shoot apex in monocot stems is more elongated. Leaf sheathes grow up around it, protecting it. This is true to some extent of almost all monocots. Monocots rarely produce secondary growth and are therefore seldom woody. However, many monocot stems increase in diameter via anamolous secondary growth.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Fern stems<br>  Most ferns have rhizomes with no vertical stem. The exception is tree ferns, with vertical stems up to about 15 meters. Stem anatomy of ferns is more complicated that dicots because fern stems often have one or more leaf gaps in cross section. A leaf gap is where the vascular tissue branches off to a frond. In cross section, the vascular tissue does not form a complete cylinder where a leaf gap occurs. Fern stems may have solenosteles or dictyosteles or variations of them. Many fern stems have phloem tissue on both sides of the xylem in cross-section.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Economic importance<br>  There are thousands of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro. Sugar cane stems are a major source of sugar. Maple sugar is obtained from trunks of maple trees. Vegetables from stems are asparagus, bamboo shoots, cactus pads or nopalitos, kohlrabi, Jerusalem artichoke and water chestnut. The spice, cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk. Cellulose from tree trunks is a food additive in bread, grated Parmesan cheese, and other processed foods. Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of Acacia senegal trees. Chicle, the main ingredient in chewing gum, is obtained from trunks of the chicle tree.<br>  <br>  Medicines obtained from stems include quinine from the bark of cinchona trees, camphor distilled from wood of a tree in the same genus that provides cinnamon, and the muscle relaxant curare from the bark of tropical vines.<br>  <br>  Wood is a used in thousands of ways, e.g. [building material|buildings], furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car parts, musical instruments, sports equipment, railroad ties, utility poles, fenceposts, pilings, toothpicks, matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel staves, toys, tool handles, picture frames, veneer, charcoal and firewood. Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, cardboard, cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon. Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding. Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building. Reed stems are also important building materials in some areas.<br>  <br>  Tannins used for tanning leather are obtained from the wood of certain trees, such as quebracho. Cork is obtained from the bark of the cork oak. Rubber is obtained from the trunks of Hevea brasiliensis. Rattan, used for furniture and baskets, is made from the stems of tropical vining palms. Bast fibers for textiles and rope are obtained from stems include flax, hemp, jute and ramie. The earliest paper was obtained from the stems of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians.<br>  <br>  Amber is fossilized sap from tree trunks; it is used for jewelry and may contain ancient animals. Resins from conifer wood are used to produce turpentine and rosin. Tree bark is often used as a mulch and in growing media for container plants.<br>  <br>  Some ornamental plants are grown mainly for their attractive stems, e.g.:
AA10631515	I know what you mean - it's that lovely stuff called Rouille, a sort of chilli paste that they spread on croutons & serve with bouillabaise.

aac6ebd14e516abf0695228fede18214aa	Yes you can.  Margarine is basically shortening with water and flavoring.  When I make pie crust I use half butter and half shortening.  Shortening alone has no flavor, and crusts made only with shortening arent very good.|`|AA10242125	My dad always used margarine. However it is hard to roll out.

Hydrogenating the oil, that is, adding hydrogen gas to it at a high temperature and pressure, is what transforms it from a liquid at room temperature to a solid. <br>  <br>  If your recipe calls for shortening to grease the griddle, of course you can use any fat you like, or you can be resolutely traditional and omit the fat.|`|44266186e2e7b908dbda0e3123da790faa	i guess so|`|73929c7f81bddeb578c96d12b93f432daa	Different fats provide different functions in recipes. In cookies and cakes, fat is “creamed” to hold air. In a piecrust, the fat is needed so “pockets” of fat will create a flaky crust when baked. Interchanging different kinds of fat sometimes results in flops—still edible—but not desirable!|`|c67e0ad8fb05b2aa3e08199587e27b21aa	it wont be as good, but yes. just don't try diet margarine as it has too much water in it<br>  and no, margarine does not have water in it, its 100% fat,only diet margarine has added water, and it would ruin a piecrust|`|AA12397458	Yes but you will not get the same result. Margarine has a lot more water in it. Use shortening, or butter.

r4RPCjmGaa	Contrary to popular belief, hot dogs are not made from left-over meat laying around on the floors of meat-packing houses. Whether it is pork or beef that is stuffed into a hot dog, the meat trimmings are carefully selected just like the meat you buy in your grocer's coolers.<br>  Most recipes for hot dogs combine together a blend of meats (pork, beef, chicken, or turkey), meat fat, a cereal filler which could be either bread crumbs, flour, or oatmeal, a little bit of egg white, and a array of herbs and seasonings including garlic, pepper, ground mustard, nutmeg, salt, and onion. <br>  Once these ingredients are ground together, the stuffing is squeezed into sausage casings. Many of the hot dogs sold in stores are enclosed in synthetic cellulose casings, but most home-made hot dogs are made out of natural animal intestines. <br>  Following the stuffing process is the pre-cooking cycle in which the hot dog links are tossed into boiling water for approximately 15 minutes. Finally, the dogs are packaged, loaded on delivery trucks, and sent off to food markets.|`|ESmjVTadaa	Hot Dogs are made from beef.
