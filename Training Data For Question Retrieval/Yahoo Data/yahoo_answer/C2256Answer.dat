W5E8GhiBaa	I think it depends on the game. Like with Call of Duties, I like to play it solo campaign wise, then when I'm done I get online with it. Some games I like to just play for myself. Plus you can pause it when you are playing alone.|`|a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	Computer vs Console?<br>  <br>  Pros of Computer: Games such as World of Warcraft and other RPGs are severely superior to console counterparts; Graphic comparisons depend on the amount of money you are willing to pay for a computer; Hand-eye coordination is much easier to use effectively on a computer; A majority of games offer free updates(exluding WoW), whereas most Xbox360/PS3 updates cost, for instance, Microsoft Points in weird sizes so that you have to by like 1000 pts for something that costs 200 pts.<br>  <br>  Cons to Computer: First person shooter graphics/campaigns do not seem to be as good; Much more can go wrong with PC's = more frustration if something does go wrong<br>  <br>  It comes down to a matter of what genre of games you prefer to play.<br>  <br>  =P Hope this helps!|`|XX0ac9iRaa	By online do you mean on the internet or multiplayer over your console? If you mean on the internet, definitely on your console. The graphics are better, the games are longer and because development teams have actually put effort and money into making it a good game. If you mean online play on your console, I'd say it depends on the game.|`|zzlvkLKwaa	Personally, I think console because you have to pay, which means there is going to be more to it.

4gliQ2H9aa	There is more than 3 million unique users who have played COD5 since it came out, average a $6.50 monthly xbox live fee for each and that is a quick $19.5 Million Dollar revenue per month.<br>  <br>  That is just off COD5, if you take into account people who haven't played COD5 and total users on Xbox live global...you're pushing probably more than 100 Million per month. (That's an educated guess, the first one is at minimum.)<br>  <br>  Also the video game industry has hardly any expenses (in comparison to other industry) so most of their revenue is profit.<br>  <br>  So your answer: Unless upper management starts hating money, then it will never be free.|`|V50hT5P9aa	prob not, theres too much money in it for microsoft to ever make it free|`|rbMsaeJzaa	Your asking if money hungry microsoft will make something free?Fat chance.I don't think it will ever be free,Im surprised they still give free 1 months out,though I guess once you play on live your hooked...whick means more money for them....|`|Ddfff5psaa	Maybe when they come up with something way more trendsetting and fun to play.|`|rBWm8pPuaa	Nope|`|WsI2yLCWaa	nope|`|I4V4q2FEaa	i wish|`|rr9aeKStaa	Will world of warcraft ever be free?

x3xf038paa	Here's a list of what you need to get started. I put my recommended brands in parenthesis:<br>  <br>  1. Paper trimmer (Fiskars $20)<br>  2. Spring action titanium scissors (Fiskars $14). These are great for precise cutting and poking holes.<br>  3. Scotch glue stick $3. There are tons of adhesive options but it's fine to start with a glue stick.<br>  4. Idea magazine (Scrapbooks Etc $5)<br>  5. Tool kit (Making Memories $20 or $40)<br>  6. Cutting mat (Basic Grey Magnetic Cutting Mat $24)<br>  <br>  Go shopping through your magazine and pick out one layout that inspires you. Make a list of the types of things used on the page. For example: cardstock, brads, patterned paper, ribbon, buttons, punches, stamps. Then, buy what you need to recreate the page. Colors and patterns can be your own. The leftovers will start your on-hand supplies and keep going from there. Michaels and similar stores can be very overwhelming. Be careful not to just buy everything you like! That gets very expensive, very quickly. ALWAYS take your coupon from the Sunday paper.|`|gxL9qeTyaa	Hello! I am a scrapbooking fool! lol I love making scrapbooks.  if this is your first time I would just by a scrapbook (Walmart or Michael's or crafts 2000) somewhere like that. then I would by some additional paper. The colorful pretty paper. Since its for your son you could get ones with balls on them (ex. baseball, football, basketballs). What is your son into? Like does he like balls, trucks, elmo whatever he is interested in I would by the stickers of that. They also make the 3-D stickers. They are a few dollars and you only get like 10-15 stickers but they are so cute. I would get a variety of both stickers. You will need a glue stick (I'd use it instead of tape) markers, colored pencils, stamps things like that. Things to put into your scrapbook besides pictures would be: things your son has made on paper (crafts, coloring pages, pictures he drew). I also have a page or 2 in my scrapbooks for people (like family and close friends) to sign or write a note to my children on. It is really a good idea and they can look back and she what everyone wrote to them.  There is tons of things you can do to make it an awesome scrapbook! Have fun!!|`|vADIpPxtaa	Because the select in craft stores can be overwhelming, a great way to start is to take a look at some scrapbooking layouts online. This way you can get an idea of what other people are doing and start thinking about what you like, what you don't, and what you think will work for your book. There are some great project ideas and tips here: <a href="http://www.favecrafts.com/Scrapbooking" rel="nofollow">http://www.favecrafts.com/Scrapbooking</a><br>  <br>  I also think one of the easiest ways to narrow down your scrapbook ideas is to start with photos and other memorabilia that you want to use. Make the pages around the photos, and use those themes, ideas and items to craft the rest of your book.|`|lqV9SSUgaa	Hello, I am a creative memories consultant. At creative memories we have beginner collections. Which provides you with everything you need to complete to your very first album. They are a 12X12 album. They come with the tape runner, a black pen made for scrapbooking, the paper you will need to complete the album. Page protectors and a complete booklet giving you a guide on how to complete the album. These beginner collections are currently 99$. We also have 8X8 albums kits that are 49$. These are wonderful products and make great albums. If you click the link below it will take you directly to the beginner collections.

The first thing you have to do is choose an album.  If you will look at the albums in most stores, they are called post bound albums.  Open them up, and you will see that the pages are held to the post with about 1/8th inch of plastic.   It is just a matter of TIME before they fall apart.  People put so much work into these albums of love, and then they rip and come apart.<br>     The Creative Memories album has a lifetime guarantee.  It is held together with metal "straps" and the edges are reinforced to keep out light and dust.  They also lay flat, which is another big difference.<br>     That is your first step.<br>     Your next step is to visit a fabulous website called www.dennydavis(dot)net    I don't know who this gentleman is but he has the most fabulous ideas.  Go to the index and type in "b" for boy and there are tons of ideas.  I use this site all the time.  For example, "My Precious (your son's name)" and "I'm a big boy now" are just 2 of the titles...there are thousands.  You will love this site!<br>      Next, everything you purchase should be acid/lignon free, as you want to preserve your photos.  Gosh, I have so much I could share with you, as remembering that your son will be most interested in looking at his photos....and your journalling as a mother.  Write and write some more, next to his photos. To him.  Ahhhh, I have a lot more I could say.  If you want to contact me, I can be reached at my email which is lovefamilymemories(at)yahoo.com<br>    Best of luck and know that this treasure of love for your son will be your most valuable material treasure.|`|AA11172918	One great way to get started scrapbooking is by doing digital scrapbooking.

You can create extra copies for the grandparents for just the incremental cost of the book.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I like Hobby Lobby.

Do you really need to get a gold star to show how good you are?<br>  Man up!|`|I4V4q2FEaa	There are Nazi Zombie achievements? do you mean challenges? last time i checked there were no achievements for that specific game mode.|`|VaR58G9qaa	I cheated for godmode and i kept playing until it was 35 or so, but nothing happens, it is just a waste of time!|`|6dRBJUnraa	DOH!!!|`|OsvMjdzWaa	If it is only a challenge (which i think it is) you might not have unlocked the challenge yet so you can't do it. Also to the guy who cheated of course you didn't get anything, when you cheat it nulls achievements/challenges.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	i'm not sure, but me and friend were playing it and we got to level 17!

GKiCsfrEaa	You would be best off with something for around $15-$45 or so from yoyonation.com.<br>  <br>  You could get anything from yoyojam, but i would reccomend the lyn fury or speedmaker, or the dark magic if you want to spend even more. You will not be at an advanced level if you use a yomega PB XB. Most yoyos nowadays will not return with a simple tug, HOWEVER, if you buy a yoyofactory velocity (also at yoyonation) you can change the level of responsiveness so it will come up easier if you want.<br>  <br>    Kieran!<br>  <br>  check this out also! : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_IHsukQLSc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_IHsukQL...</a>|`|M9FQSKRwaa	a cheap one from the dollar store
9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	1) The campaign is essentially a series of Boss fights (there is stuff in between but it is all easy) the boss's are always jaw dropping in size and are usually giant insects. There is on foot shooting which is your standard run 'n' gun but it is really well executed as well as playing in mechs giant robots(not as fun as it sounds due to bad controls)<br>  2) The game really isn't that long, you could finish it in one sitting if you really went for it. I'd give it about 9 or 10 hours which is about average.<br>  3) One or two missions are fantastic and incredibly replayable there are others you will get through once and never want to play again.<br>  4)No, there is multiplayer but as far as I know it is online only. The multiplayer wasn't that good anyways so you wouldn't miss much if you dont have live.<br>  5) Lets put it this way the story is enough to keep the game going but it's not going to win any awards for innovation. It's all about an amnesiac finding out who he is and then trying to stop a conspiracy which kills his father.<br>  6) The controls for running and shooting are fantastic. There is a brilliant dive mechanism for the boss fights and the grapple gun is the easiest to control of any game I've played.<br>  On the other hand some of the mechs control quite badly which is why they aren't any fun.<br>  7) The best thing about the campaign without a doubt is the jaw dropping boss fights against bugs 100's of times the size of your guy.<br>  As the levels go on they keep getting bigger as well which is great.<br>  That and the graphics which were the best when it came out.<br>  For $10 I'd snap it up, I payed ￡40 for it when it was new which is about $50.|`|62mt0VKJaa	For $10 I would go ahead and get it, I thought it was a pretty good game.|`|W5E8GhiBaa	Can't remember if it's muliplayer or not, but I had a good time with it. The campaign is fun and graffics are great, but I wouldn't play it again. I will definately rent the 2nd one though. If I were you I would buy it, it's definately worth 10 bucks.|`|TimKtm9xaa	its not that long but its a really good game and pretty addictive and  sequel does look awsome (controls are good)|`|q1Fav370aa	1. Campaign is great, theres fantastic jaw dropping moments with huge monsters, lots of fun. Best mech game on consoles yet.<br>  2. It's of good length, 12+ hours. <br>  3. I didn't find it too replayable, but the multiplayer kept me coming.<br>  4. I can't remember if there is offline multiplayer.<br>  5. The story isn't great, alot of cliches: Amnesiac protagonist, story of revenge. But story aside, the moments are so cinematic and beautiful that story doesn't matter.<br>  6. This is where most people are turned off by Lost Planet. The reticle moves very slowly across the screen. The bumpers are used to make quick 90 degree turns and are better than to turn the screen by moving the reticle to the side of the screen. <br>  7. Epic monster battles are the best thing about the campaign, especially when using the many mechs. Think Shadow of Collasus size creatures, but you don't get to climb on the creatures like in Lost Planet 2 trailer. <br>  <br>  One thing to note is that the Colonies edition is the best by far, more options in muliplayer and singleplayer, and I believe more options in controls that boost reticle speed so that you don't need to use the bumpers.

mK3XsYEIaa	Your game probably is just too old and has gotten glitches. I dont think that there is a way to fix it besides getting rid of it and buying a new one. Sorry. And to answer your other questions, none of those characters are unlockable in any of the games.

Hope this helps you|`|XX0ac9iRaa	I can't solve your problem I'm afraid... but I can tell you that those three characters aren't available in any Smash Bros game on any platform (except Waluigi as an Assist Trophy in Brawl).

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	If there is no date on it then it is not a coin, but a medal of some kind. It needs to be seen, so take it to a coin dealer or two. There are private mint issues, as well as gold plated silver issues. There are even some that are gold plated copper/nickel. The gold is so thin that it is worth only a few cents. Since it could be more than one think it really needs to be seen.|`|FNxbVRX0aa	Great resource for Gold coins, you can check how much yours should be, but if there is no date, likely not a coin, but a medal of some kind.|`|ApwGFIv2aa	in the 100$
q1Fav370aa	Your next playthrough you can change class, but lose all XP. <br>  In your current playthrough, when you reach a high level you can get a sub class that will boost a couple aspects of the soldier class, but it won't change your way of playing. If you don't like the class I would change, but I'm telling you, although the classes are different, they aren't any more fun to play. Powers can be cool, but access to all guns could be better. It's less on taste and more on if you can stand playing at all.

Has a bar code and set of letters and No.#|`|DXLywddCaa	This question keeps coming up over and over and over again in Yahoo Answers and people are getting sick and tired of replying with the same ol' obvious answer!<br>  <br>  1) If you bought and paid for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, the "serial number / activation number" is in the FSX DVD case that you purchased...it's inside the back cover.<br>  <br>  2) If you "purchased" your FSX DVD's from EBAY, you probably won't get a "serial or activation" number from the seller as these EBAY sellers still have FSX downloaded in their system and don't want you to have the "serial / activation" number so that they can keep it in their system..."Let the buyer beware!"<br>  <br>  3) If you have a "pirated" copy of FSX, the best you can do is contact Microsoft to get a "serial / activation" nunber for it, but you will have to pay Microsoft for it, so it would have been best just to purchase your own copy in the first place!<br>  <br>  4) If anyone in Yahoo Answers is willing to give you their FSX "serial / activation" number, they're out of their minds!!!
Xm5ab6F6aa	I have been doing doll repair for a long time, I often buy the older teddy bears cut them up remove the stuffing which is a cotton batting, also lambs wool works well too. The pillow stuffing is what many newer dolls are stuffed with and they really need a small bead sack inside to give them weight to hold the doll on the ground. I use chop sticks to do all of my stuffing and I do use small pieces at a time, then when its stuffed I knead the outside to make it smooth. Hope this helps|`|cuR7T3praa	Right now I have looked for filling and only came up with polyester in a craft store that was selling it for filling a single sized bed.  What I did find with it was that I had to rip it apart and was glad for that as it did fill the small  places and it is washable and in white so it will not fade.|`|vahn499Raa	um............

OsvMjdzWaa	I'd  suggest re-installing it, try not to go doing tonnes of work to fix it if you can just re-install if you don't want to lose your save games there should be a folder with them in.

The same purpose goes for video games|`|4f6c56ff039b093c20edda9920df0d32aa	It means there are either additional features or additional content, like levels, extra weapons, and more characters.<br>  <br>  Be aware that some of the content could be slightly racy, like R-rated movie racy. That might get you in trouble.<br>  <br>  But chances are that "uncut" means "more than the original version".

I recommend you give them your real one because this is easier for verification. If you give them your spam one you might accidentally delete it. The site doesn't spam you its all the offers you will be doing that send the junk email.<br>  <br>  They also ask for your address. Don't worry too much about this all they need your address for is to mail you prizes.<br>  <br>  After you signup they will send you a confirmation link to your email address you entered. Click the link and you're done. The email should come pretty quick (usually instantly). And make sure you check your spam folders.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Complete Offers<br>  <br>  Once inside you can check out the prize list.<br>  <br>  To earn points click on "Available Offers". There you will see a whole list of offers and how many points you'll get if you complete that offer. When filling out an offer you don't have to give your real home address or phone number. And make sure you use your spam email account because believe me you will be spammed. Also, be sure to check your email occasionally for those offers that require email confirmation otherwise you won't get credited for completing the offer properly.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips for filling out offers:<br>  1. Read the offer carefully so you know exactly what to do to get the points.<br>  2. Delete cookies before every offer<br>  3. Complete offer with realistic information<br>  4. Use a browser that accepts cookies and turn your security down<br>  5. Let each page load completely<br>  <br>  Also remember that even though most of the time you'll get the points 5-10 minutes after completing the offer, some may take up to a day or more (depending on the offer). So don't worry if you don't see the points just keep going they will appear if you've done everything correctly.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Claim Your Prize<br>  <br>  After you have enough points you can now go to "Available Prizes" and see what you can cash those points in for. This is the fun part. =)<br>  <br>  They have a ton of prizes. You'll see stuff like consoles (Xbox, PS3, Wii), video games, iPods, etc. There are Xbox Live cards in the "Xbox" section and will be emailed to you. Physical prizes like iPods and video games will deliver so make sure your address is correct before you claim a prize that requires shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, something many people don't realize is that if you don't see anything you like you can actually send a request for a custom prize. Just send support a ticket with a link to what you want from amazon.com and they'll let you know how many points you'll need. Basically it will be a point for every dollar. <br>  <br>  Thats it!<br>  hope i could help.<br>  message me, if you have any questions.

q0EwnYroaa	First, instead of typing in the petition box, “Peter, please answer the . . .” begin by instead typing:<br>  <br>  “.”<br>  That’s right. Simply type a period. What happens next is pure magical genius.Instead of seeing what you’d expect (a “.”) you see a “P”. Then type whatever the heck you want and the rest of the phrase “Peter, please answer the following” appears.<br>  As long as nobody pays any attention to where your fingers are actually landing the prank works slick.<br>  The trick to the prank is to here type in the answer to whatever question you are going to ask next. When you’re done just keep typing until the phrase is complete. Whenever you hit the “:” your cursor will jump to the next box–where you’ll type in the actual question.<br>  Hit return and bingo!

Does that mean that you are taking a wireless signal from a neighbor or something? Could you be a bit more clear?<br>  <br>  I am going to answer the question assuming that the wireless signal from your house is not yours ( a neighbor's maybe). The PS3 should have the WiFi modem already built in so you dont have to buy anything for it. What you need to do is to go on the "settings" tab, then "network settings" There should be an option called "internet connection setting". Select "easy" then there should be a list of options on which wireless network you want to connect to. Select "scan" to connect to the wireless network then follow the directions on screen.<br>  <br>  Its that simple

But sometimes the "Stuff" expansions will require the last "big" expansion pack installed such as "Seasons".  The bigger expansion packs are more like a new base to start from and the "stuff" packs just add on to that so you usually can't use the "stuff" expansion packs disc. *wew*.  All in all though it will tell you which disc to use when you try to start up the game.<br>  Happy siming!|`|7Ca2ns47aa	I believe it's the latest released disk...

6difexIJaa	Well first off make sure Daemon is running.  It will show up in the corner of the taskbar near the clock.<br>  <br>  Right click it and look at all the options.  Eventually you will see a "Mount Image..." option.  Click that, and it will open a window to load the image to the program.  Navigate in that window to the WC3 download, and load it.  Should work fine, but be warned, I did this once from a torrent before and luckily I had my anti virus working.  So be careful.|`|vWtucEFSaa	Daemon tools is awesome.  You just have to have the ISO of the disk you want to mount.  I assume that's what you downloaded.<br>  <br>  I'm going to ignore the potentially illegal nature of this, and not encourage it.  But I will briefly explain daemon tools, as if you already paid for Warcraft III and just want the ISO or something.<br>  <br>  You should easily install the tools.  And it should be self explanitory.  When it install and loads, it should be at the bottom on your screen, on the task bar.  You can click on there and mount an ISO file.  Browse for the file and mount.  It should be easy and self explainitory.

Dso7k3sjaa	The first two people are pretty much correct.  That's the long way and the way that the game developers intended it be done.  But you can also turn them into a vampire by turning on the testingcheats (while still in neighborhood view) and then clicking on Make me a Vampire.<br>  <br>  Here's the cheat in case you don't know it:<br>  <br>  boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true<br>  <br>  Now, go into your sims' lot and hold the shift key down and click on your sim -- you can pause first if that makes it easier.  Now look for the Make me a Vampire option and click on that.<br>  <br>  It's really not a good idea to leave that cheat turned on while you are playing, but you don't have to leave your sims' lot to turn it back off.  Just open the cheat box back up and type:<br>  <br>  boolProp testingCheatsEnabled false<br>  <br>  Now it's turned back off.  Oh, and you can use all lowercase letters.  I always do and it always works -- some people say that you have to use both upper and lowercase letters and you don't have to for any of the cheats.  (Although, when I try to use the familyFunds cheat it does not seem to work if I don't make that second "f" and uppercase "f", so that sort of goes against all the other ones.  :)|`|C0pk4kgJaa	Well like the other people said. Go to any community lot around midnight or later. Make sure your sim isn't sleepy or anything like that because they will fall asleep on the floor in public lol. Make sure you have somebody else with you that YOU can control. Then you click on the vampire (either the boy or girl one will show up.. or both, I don't know) click on "influence" and then click on "Influence to Bite -insert persons name here-" then they will do it. And then I think that the sim that was bit that you are controlling can bite other people. Like your other sim that you are controlling. Vampires can't go out in daylight, so buy them a coffin. Also to become normal again you buy the vampcrillidon from the match maker and make your sim drink it. <br>  <br>  Have fun! :D|`|InslW3QMaa	ok what you got to do is have your sim going to a downtown area (if you have that game) then they can just hang around there until a vampire comes then you click on the vampire and press influence bite (i think i am pretty sure but i could be wrong)|`|OwoSQaZIaa	if you have Sims 2 nightlife go to a community lot and wait for a while then maybe a pale person should come. just keep talking with them till you see the option influence bite

Fallout 3 - I find this a bucket of fun! takes a bit of thinking and practice but like the others I love it.  However it does take large chunks of your day/night away quickly.<br>  <br>  2. Mass Effect - Such a great story driven RPG, in fact the story lead me to purchase the novel.  However the combat system is kinda lack luster but I forgive it, looking forward to the sequel.<br>  <br>  3. Dynasty Warriors 7 - Why? I know it's kinda cheesy, un inspired even with poor voice acting to boot, but in the end it doesn't try to be anything more than a great hack and slash with co-op to boot, have a campaign or just a battle if your on the move!<br>  <br>  4. Gears of War 2 - Fun game, well rounded just a lot of fun.  It's extremely clean and decent gameplay makes this game a good buy deffinatly...kinda mindless however.<br>  <br>  5. Condemed - Scary as hell with a lot of innovative gameplay, especially with the melee combat, interested in following a serial killer and doing a bit of CSI on each of his murders?<br>  <br>  Enjoy these are 5 games I think everyone should at least borrow and have a blast on!|`|jQBpUJKzaa	halo 3 and left 4 dead|`|m2eHPeciaa	halo or gears of war|`|PQbIFJVSaa	halo----fallout 3

SCB44Mu9aa	It's on the front of the desk.  One of the easiest ways is to move around the room until you are looking at the front of the desk.  Keep switching pictures until you find the one that contains "water"<br>  <br>  The most sure way to find it, though it takes a good 15 minutes or so is to click the next picture button (kinda looks like a play button on the top right).  Keep pressing it until you find the right picture.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

But those are extremely annoying. They almost never work and there are way too little of them. Don't even try. (I got 5 G coins over a period of 6 months). I recommend Prize Rebel. They have tons of free surveys, much more than ijji and also the points can be used for almost any reward (including PS3 console). Also its completely legit, I've tried it.

vBid6hbbaa	To make a ride go underground, the land that the ride is going into can't be sloped, it has to be flat up and down.  It also needs to be 2 height block-things high.  Then you just build a custom design and poof! undergroud it is.
Uc7BNCxRaa	I think you'll only know by coming back for awhile. The game affects each personal differently.<br>  <br>  Personally, I love the game as it is basically a real time game -- meaning stuff happens while I'm gone and the clock doesn't stop for anyone or for any reason.<br>  <br>  I love how it is a MMORPG and its structure (where I suspect most people consider it boring).<br>  <br>  NOTE:  Recently, SE has been putting a lot of work into making it easier to level (especially 60-75 but actually for all levels).  Additionally, it is MUCH easier to level a job from 1 to 75 SOLO!  I've done it on 2 jobs and could have done it on a 3rd (but I took the party route).<br>  <br>  I plan on leveling BLM next to 75 (from 56) and think much of the work will be solo (though that might change, only time will tell the tale).  I'm completing taking DRG to 75 (done 1 to 72).  I'd say it is 96% solo and 4% parties / XP scrolls.<br>  <br>  So the bottom line is I can't tell you- only you (or someone who is like you (e.g. same tastes, etc) can tell you.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  I like parties and working with others as much as I do soloing.  I think this mind set helps make the game fun.|`|vqORe0Opaa	sounds as if u want to start so don't ask just do it lol|`|PQbIFJVSaa	no I started back up like 5 weeks ago and got right out like 4 days after I did it lol I couldn't stand it. its all the same with those games just lvl boring
Q0G2sukJaa	it depends if you want strength or speed , cross bowmen are more in strength but slower , while hunters have faster attack but not stronger , i have a hunter and a ranger and i like there skills . but crossbowmen and snipers have unique skills. it really depends on what you like and the skills they have .  HUNTERS FTW!!! :P
V4ZSGQBoaa	I think that it may be possible because they did this update without doing anything to the game or even needing the nintendo system update.  Nintendo seems to finally be getting its poop in a group.  In june there is a game coming out called the conduit.  It will have much much better graphics and a better physics engine.  The newer games will continuously get better.  The Nintendo wii is capable of a lot more than some of the game production companies are pushing it to do.  I think the Conduit will set a new bar with its xbox 360 like graphics, online play, with wii speak and wii motion plus.  The system itself is capable of mostly the same things as 360 and ps3.  It is mainly the new form of controls that companies were having trouble with.  They are getting better and things should be changing soon.  Those new modes are pretty cool, and I hope that they add more like the Nazi Zombie mode!|`|wIFb6Vs3aa	I really doubt they can make the Zombie Mode for the Wii, because the console can't handle it.<br>  They might be able to squeeze in more modes for online, though.|`|28X3lp3Saa	With today's technology, I'd be surprised if they couldn't.<br>  <br>  also hardcore free for all rocks!|`|5HfuI3MEaa	they are lazy.|`|5yBAMbIZaa	its because someone else already made zombie mode and if they make it for call of duty people will think that the game that had zombie mode first is better and they will buy that game instead of call of duty
2Q2ltt1Saa	World of Warcraft.  Get a char leveled and geared right and people will pay good money for it.<br>  <br>  You've pretty much got to get in on the ground floor of something new; games that do this now, like Second Life, are way saturated and it'd take a lot of work and something completely revolutionary to be original enough to make a lot of money off your content.

c1BdzCayaa	i am lookin it up and it says autumn 2009 i cant tell but if you want some tips on hows the game plays like...ill give 3<br>  <br>  :the player does not assume the role of the Master Chief as in the Halo trilogy,Instead, the player controls a lone soldier in the city of New Mombasa, Kenya.Since the soldier, known as an ODST or Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, does not possess Master Chief's advanced armor, reflexes and strength, he is more vulnerable to weapons fire; players are forced to act more cautiously. While the game is not focused on stealth gameplay, some elements of stealth will be incorporated. It will also include an open world environment.<br>  <br>  :The manin objecy<br>  The main objective of ODST is to lead the soldier through the ruins of New Mombasa and discover what happened to his missing teammates. After finding a piece of evidence left behind—a sniper rifle hanging on a lamppost, for example—a flashback is triggered and the player assumes the role of the missing soldier.After players find the first beacon, the choice of where to go next is up to the player.ODST's multiplayer offering is similar to Halo 3's, and will ship with a total of twenty-four maps: the original eleven Halo 3 maps, the Mythic Map Pack (three maps), Legendary Map Pack (three maps), Heroic Map Pack (three maps), and the map "Cold Storage". Three more new maps will be included in the game. <br>  <br>  <br>  :the rookie...<br>  <br>  The game's protagonist, referred to as the "rookie", is an unnamed member of the UNSC Marines' Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) or "Helljumpers". ODSTs often deploy in small, one-man Human Entry Vehicles (HEVs), launched from spaceships in the upper atmosphere.[9] During the game, The "Rookie" is separated from his four teammates (Romeo, Dutch, Buck, and Mickey) and must find out what happens to them with the guidance of a city maintenance AI known as the Superintendent.|`|WqtCdGSeaa	About ODST game can be read in <a href="http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=ODST%20game" rel="nofollow">http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>|`|cHTcGi72aa	autumn 2009

ye9h5jXvaa	You'd be using someone else's creations without their permission, so it certainly wouldn't be okay.<br>  <br>  Nintendo will turn a blind eye to some stuff if it's basically harmless, but they'll shut down any fan project that uses anything of theirs once it starts attracting too much attention. Square did the same to the guys working on the Chrono Trigger 3D remake. It's standard  practice.
ZAoiQhxkaa	Modern Warface in my opinion, is way better than World At War. I think that Modern Warfare was a very fun game and the online modes and story mode is highly compelling and intriguing. And I love the high use of weapons that there is. World At War was a stupid concept in my opinion, because the COD company brang it back to the World War 2 days as previous versions had. I think that modern warfare highly exceeds it both in multiplayer modes, guns, story mode, and especially the mile high club that is the best.|`|K9NLPzxGaa	This is totally true. cod 4 just is better to play. waw is very dark and the music is also very dark. people only play it because... well its a new cod isnt it. i totally agree with you mate :) (y)|`|VjSCeYNsaa	I totally agree...cod Waw was WAY to far fetched...(laying prone and suddenly 4 grenades just appear on you...wtf?) and I liked the missions in modern warfare SO much more...seems more classic then other war games as well|`|YFmXD25caa	CoD 4 is better than CoD 5. It seems to be more realistic and it lags/ghosts less often|`|kr1yr9Nmaa	No way<br>  but i guess thats your opinon<br>  I love WaW and hated cod 4|`|8p8Hy3YBaa	I think WOW is like the best because i'm  a super huge fan of WWII missions and weaponry, but #4 is good for like high tech squad form gameplay.|`|AEl15Ntqaa	i enjoy them both equally. it was nice they used the new engine to make the world war 2 shooter cool. people like the updated guns and such, that's why modern warfare is still a big game. i to can't wait for modern warfare 2. peace.|`|CEzDLiaGaa	well,  i find that the guns and challenges and maps and teams (example: S.A.S, and Spentsnaz) in cod 4 are better, but i find that the graphics, the quality, the storyline and the gameplay is better in cod waw than in cod 4.|`|LxZFioqwaa	I dont know why but CoD4 seems to be more exciting, the concept is exactly the same but the guns are better, the maps are better, the control is better, its easier to kill, the gameplay is all round better.<br>  <br>  Can't wait for Modern Warfare: 2<br>  Going to be epic.|`|a59a532e69f52597a5c92c6ec57e416faa	meh.. it was something different.. both get old and repetitive none the lessssssssss|`|yo65rDLDaa	i perfer five but thats just a matter of opion i guess

BwsTfgWaaa	Yea, they'll fix it, but they won't give you a new warranty on it. Your gonna have to buy a new policy after this if you want another warranty on it.<br>  100 bucks is kind of pricy though, i just bought an arcade with a new warranty and switched hard drives. I got one with a year warranty and when ones in i can play the other.<br>  Also to the post above me, those are pretty dangerous if you don't know what your doing and will pretty much break the xbox even more.|`|MaSmBqDMaa	ok im not some gamer chick, but my bros r adcits. my bro said something about "the red ring of death" when the xbox lights up red when it gets too hot. so its prolly overheated. so just let it rest and unplg it for awhile.|`|UWgQL8iRaa	There are some homemade ways to get rid of the red ring.

If there was 3 flashing red light that's another story.  Your xbox is most likely overheated.  If you do send it in to ms it's free if it's under warranty.  If not expect to pay a lot for a new warranty.|`|3eQhA8nraa	my halo 3 edition got e 74, microsoft fixed it for free. i don't know why they aren't fixing yours for free. they won't put a new warranty on it. i recommend saving up another hundred and buying a new arcade, then just swap out the consoles. for the extra hundred bucks, you get another three xbox live trials, and a warranty. i think thats the better deal.
lG7HdW6Gaa	You can use the CD's to install it on your computer, but you would still need to purchase an activation key from Blizzard on their website. If you're thinking of doing that, have your friend send you a recruitment thing from the WoW website. You'll both get benefits.|`|BV8ZzM6iaa	You can download the game on to your computer but you can't play without the CD Key, rendering the disc near useless to you.|`|7sdK02CBaa	You don't even really need the disk to download the game.  To activate your account, which is the most important part, you have to have the unique key which comes with the CD or you can just buy it online.  You can actually download the actual game from Blizzard directly or from many different mirrors.|`|9nTh0zOSaa	Yes and no. You can share the disks to install the game, but that's about it. To make an account you need the activation code, and that's unique to each game, and expansion. (BC and WOTLK disks also have thier own codes.)<br>  <br>  Right now its cheapest to buy the WOW Battlechest set and go from there.

Particularly GeistCH's Saint walkthrough if your aim is to save as many people as you can.|`|BwsTfgWaaa	Frank West (voiced by T.J. Rotolo): The protagonist of Dead Rising, Frank is an overly zealous freelance photographer and photojournalist, who has covered wars. He originally came to Willamette for the "scoop of a lifetime", thinking that the incident was a simple riot. Throughout the game Frank attempts to uncover the truth behind the zombie outbreak by investigating recent events and questioning the people he encounters. Normally an "Average Joe", Frank is forced to take on the role of hero and rescue the many people trapped within various sections of the mall. <br>  Isabella Keyes (voiced by Kim Mai Guest): The younger sister of Carlito. Very little is known about her, but she worked at Dr. Barnaby's laboratories in Santa Cabeza as a medical technician. She initially works against Frank and the others, but later chooses to aid them in stopping her brother. <br>  Carlito Keyes (voiced by Alex Fernandez): The older brother of Isabella. Carlito tries to kill Frank and Brad at every turn, and is behind the outbreak in Willamette. Most of the game is spent trying to uncover the motivation of and story behind Carlito and his connection to the zombies. <br>  Brad Garrison (voiced by T. J. Storm): A DHS agent who reluctantly fights alongside Frank throughout the story. He assumes the responsibility of trying to locate Dr. Barnaby early in the game. At first he is uneasy to be around a member of the press and even goes so far as to stereotype Frank as a crooked paparazzo. However, he soon grows to trust Frank. <br>  Jessica McCarney (voiced by Laura Napoli): Brad's rookie partner. She is charged with watching the monitors for information on the people responsible for the outbreak. Like Brad, she is distrustful of Frank, and patronizes him for being a civilian. However, she grows to trust Frank. <br>  Otis Washington: An elderly mall janitor. Otis tries in vain to stop Frank from chasing Brad back into the mall, and winds up handing over a map and spare transceiver. He periodically sends the player information and scoops over Frank's transceiver. If Frank is unable to reach the stairs of the Entrance Plaza when the zombies are first let in, and instead is knocked out, it is Otis that drags him from the chaos. After the special forces arrive, a note left by Otis can be found in the security room. It reveals that he managed to escape, along with all of the survivors Frank had saved, by hijacking a military helicopter. <br>  Dr. Russell Barnaby (voiced by Phil Proctor): A ruthless genetic researcher whose work leads to the events in the game. <br>  Ed DeLuca (voiced by Dave Wittenberg): The helicopter pilot who delivered Frank to Willamette, scheduled to return in three days to retrieve Frank.

D2bmoTw2aa	There is no way to cheat on RuneScape unless you used a hack or a bot which I would never ever look to to get leveled up. If you mean leveling up your combat (this isn't a cheat but its definitely efficient) and your combat is at least level 30-60 go into the Stronghold of Security and go to the second level and you will find Flesh Crawlers. They are easy to kill and whatever level they are there max hit is 1 but they are accurate so they hit you a lot sometimes and sometimes they don't. Just bring food and strength potion and you will be fine.<br>  <br>   If you want to level up mining go to the Al Karid mine and mine iron and then drop it. That is called power mining and I thought it wouldn't work but I got from level 25 to 55 in less then a week (literally).<br>  <br>   If you want to level up your wood cutting then go to a place with a lot of trees and cut. The best place though, is Draynor with the swamp with the willow trees. There is a bank right next to it but be advised, you need to be level 30 to cut willows.<br>  <br>  The easiest to level up is Fishing. Just fish down in Lumbridge Swamp, and then once your level 15 go to Al Karid an fish there. Then once your level 30 fishing go to the always goblin filled house near Al Karid gate and fish next to it. Then when your level 40 go to the Barbarian Village (same place as Stronghold of Security) and fish there.<br>  <br>  If you wanna level up your Smithing and make some cash fast then get some iron somehow and go to Al Karid Bank. Once your in just north of that you'll find a furnace. Go back and forth making iron bars which sell somewhere around 400 each. Then sell them at G.E.<br>  <br>  If you want to level up your Crafting then first get a bunch of wool and keep on spinning them on the Spin Wheel thing. Then once your level 10 go to Grand Exchange and buy a bunch of gold bars. Then get a necklace mold. Make a bunch of Gold Necklaces in the furnace in Al Karid and bank them until you have a lot of necklaces. Then sell them at G.E. This process will take ridiculously long. A year to sell them. Maybe more but they finally do if you put them on Minimum Price. If you don't know where the Grand Exchange is it is West (left) of Varrock Castle.<br>  <br>  Ok... I'm done but if you want more tips, just put it down in the Additional Details thing.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer helped!|`|Md1SGHKgaa	The other people here are idiots. You do not "need a life" or should play WoW. Just add me, monster1blah. Or, train on cockroaches north of barbarian village, and get better armor progressively. Or you can email me. Whatever.

2Q2ltt1Saa	You sure can.  You can win contests for free points (which they always advertise on gaming sites and on the dashboard) or you can win every time by paying the $20/$50/etc at a store for a points card.|`|AChwrDrOaa	I have got the perfect site for you! <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb..." rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a> You will love this site. It is so easy to get free stuff. Its just a web search like google and you can win points by searching. With those points you can use it to get prizes and one of those prizes is an itunes gift cards, a wii, a ps3, ipods, gift card, plus hundreds of more prizes. There is also a music download store you can use with thise points. Right now im saving up to get a PS3 from that site by getting amazon gift cards. If you get some refferals you will get more points also. Just try out this site, very user friendly and no credit card needed. :)|`|KyXn6vW9aa	Yes, this site helped me get tons of free stuff including a 1600 microsoft points card, 13 months of xbox live gold, and other stuff... <a href="http://getmicrosoftpointsfree.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://getmicrosoftpointsfree.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <br>  Check it out...it actually works.<br>  <br>  The best thing is you can custom order anything you want.|`|lSRxzLIDaa	Yes actually.

Be careful with those though, they can be scams. Also, if you're good at a certain game, you can tell people you'll get them achievements if they send you a code for points, thats what i do (:|`|NwML5joaaa	i was wondering the same thing last year! and i found a great website on how to do it. heres my blog that explains pretty much EVERYTHING:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freeprizes4all.com" rel="nofollow">http://freeprizes4all.com</a><br>  <br>  Once you to the site in there and sign up:<br>  <br>  They will ask you for your email. I recommend you give them your real one because this is easier for verification. If you give them your spam one you might accidentally delete it. The site doesn't spam you its all the offers you will be doing that send the junk email.<br>  <br>  They also ask for your address. Don't worry too much about this all they need your address for is to mail you prizes.<br>  <br>  After you signup they will send you a confirmation link to your email address you entered. Click the link and you're done. The email should come pretty quick (usually instantly). And make sure you check your spam folders.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Complete Offers<br>  <br>  Once inside you can check out the prize list.<br>  <br>  To earn points click on "Available Offers". There you will see a whole list of offers and how many points you'll get if you complete that offer. When filling out an offer you don't have to give your real home address or phone number. And make sure you use your spam email account because believe me you will be spammed. Also, be sure to check your email occasionally for those offers that require email confirmation otherwise you won't get credited for completing the offer properly.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips for filling out offers:<br>  1. Read the offer carefully so you know exactly what to do to get the points.<br>  2. Delete cookies before every offer<br>  3. Complete offer with realistic information<br>  4. Use a browser that accepts cookies and turn your security down<br>  5. Let each page load completely<br>  <br>  Also remember that even though most of the time you'll get the points 5-10 minutes after completing the offer, some may take up to a day or more (depending on the offer). So don't worry if you don't see the points just keep going they will appear if you've done everything correctly.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Claim Your Prize<br>  <br>  After you have enough points you can now go to "Available Prizes" and see what you can cash those points in for. This is the fun part. =)<br>  <br>  They have a ton of prizes. You'll see stuff like consoles (Xbox, PS3, Wii), video games, iPods, etc. There are Xbox Live cards in the "Xbox" section and will be emailed to you. Physical prizes like iPods and video games will deliver so make sure your address is correct before you claim a prize that requires shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, something many people don't realize is that if you don't see anything you like you can actually send a request for a custom prize. Just send support a ticket with a link to what you want from amazon.com and they'll let you know how many points you'll need. Basically it will be a point for every dollar. <br>  <br>  Thats it!<br>  hope i could help.<br>  message me, if you have any questions.|`|yeI715b7aa	No that would defeat the purpose of having them in the first place.
S4IvjacEaa	Do NOT do what pollypin said! (and she spelled cymbal incorrectly).<br>  Start off with at least decent gear if you plan on sticking with it and you won't regret!<br>  you might want to invest in something a little more expensive, You'll probably need to spend about $4-500, keep in mind your gunna need cymbals and hardware along with the drums. If you start of with garbage and become more aware of what nice stuff sounds/looks like you won't be satisfied until all your garbage as been replaced.<br>  <br>  The basic set up is a pair of hi-hats, a crash cymbal, ride cymbal, 1 mtd tom, 1 floor tom, a bass drum and a snare. <br>  <br>  DRUMS- don't buy a complete set (comes w/ cymbals & hardware) if it does everything included sucks, real companies don't offer pre-packs like that.<br>  Just start with a cheaper end "shell pack" offering only the drums themselves, go with Pacific Drums/ PDP (made by respectable DW company) or get a Grestch -catalina club mod, those aren't amazing sounding/attractive kits but will do the job... If your budget was a lot higher Ddrum and Custom companies (if ever you can afford it look @ Truth & Battlefield Custom drums)<br>  <br>  CYMBALS- Go with a "cymbal pack" to start out with, at least<br>  hihats, a crash or 2 and a ride, you can add splashes and chinas later. Go with Sabian B8's, or Meinl HCS. <br>  <br>  HARDWARE- is defiantly a drag to buy because it isn't exciting/ doesn't effect sound, and it's pricey...you'll need a bass drum pedal, a hihat stand, and some stands for your snare drum and cymbals.<br>  cheap hardware "packs" are available from PDP, SP, Yahmaha, Pearl ect.<br>  <br>  STICKS&HEADS- Go with Vic Firth sticks! You won't need new heads immediately unless the ones that come with your set seriously suck, when you replace go with Remo, but by then you'll have it figured out.<br>  <br>  SITES&STORES- Here in America I buy from "Guitar Center" & "Musician's Friend" I'm sure there is a European equivalent though, but still go to their websites and to look at brands and setups. Defiantly check Ebay and Craigslist constantly once you've decided what you want, esp for cymbals since they don't cost a fortune to ship, I am always finding amazing deals there usually you can get something brand new at about a 10% discount, used up to 60%.<br>  (I'm getting a brand new Gibson guitar for 700$ while Guitar Center sells them for 1000 new, off ebay)<br>  <br>  Research around and don't be too miserly stingy, if you do it right you won't spend too much and get a nice setup, compare different products and don't be quick to spend, take your time in choosing!<br>  <br>  If you have any questions now or later on please shoot me an email!<br>  <br>  jseerden@comcast.net<br>  or seach Josh Seerden, myspace.com|`|eCgzywHfaa	zzsounds.com|`|4WttCv0paa	Get a basic beginner drum kit off ebay. 2 toms and a floor tom. 1 crash symbol. There's loads and they get deliereved straight to yout front door.
BwsTfgWaaa	They could be free over time if infinity ward wants too, or if they can find sponsors for the game to release it for free. Thats most likely will happen, if not they'll just keep a price tag on it for a while. Thats what resistance did, but they made thier map packs free when people stopped playing the first one.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	You have a set of medals not coins. They are worth the silver in them. Franklin mint items do not sell well on the secondary market for they are medals made by them. Your best bet is to check out Franklin mint items selling on ebay. You have an item that coin dealers will melt for the silver and to get more value you need to find a buyer. Ebay is good for that. A lot of people got stung with Franklin mint items thinking they were an investment, when the truth is they are a bad investment. Coin collectors collect coins as well as medals and tokens but ones that are really historic not modern made. Hope you find a value above silver melt.

I prefer not to be him.<br>  <br>  I hate boomers during campaign but love them in Versus too. But my favorite is Smoker. It's so fun to get a person who is lagging behind. I don't really like being Hunter cause you're so dependent on the others to watch your back, but I like being hunter when the team you're playing with has good teamwork.|`|cXX8iDDNaa	Francis and the Hunter<br>  They re both just badass XD|`|XKiMAh39aa	I love being bill or zoey XD<br>  i hate francis becuz he so cocky but when he is incap he's screams of help is so Francisissy XD<br>  <br>  I hate the smoker in some occasions but really love playing the hunter becuz i can do a lot if i am a hunter and the boomer(boomer!!!!!!!) because of its horde calling vomit and if miss i can always be a boomer bomb(boooooomer!!!!!!!!)
I2fIfGUqaa	Depends:<br>  <br>  Lots of life (between 80-100 hp)= Try to kill her, but if you don't kill her within first hit, run away while shooting. Best weapon to use is automatic shotgun, large blows and you don't have to reload every single shot. I'm awesome at dodging hits from tanks and vomit from boomers so it's easy for me until i reach advanced.<br>  <br>  Low life (between 50-75)=  Be careful, I mean you can kill and come out alive but the chances of your health quickly falling is 85% chance. Plus usually once your health falls below 50, you limp and since the witch is fast, that means she'll get you down on the ground in no time.<br>  <br>  Very low life (between 0-50)= Don't, walk around her because since your limping, you won't be able to run away and the chances of her killing you are 90%. I have never been in this situation but my friend has when we played co-op, lets say, my friend got raped.|`|XKiMAh39aa	It is best to go around the witch if the witch is positioned in a wide area<br>  if she is somewhat blocking your'e way then you have to take her down<br>  <br>  the best i've been using is to go behind her then run  to her then shoot her quickly with the autoshotgun (since she doesn't react quickly when you suddenly run up 2 her and she doesn't have the time to stand up and turn around and pawn you to the ground)<br>  <br>  or if there is a little space between the way out and her then run like hell right pass her(this works well because she has slow reaction time and i tried this a couple of times when im doing a rush pass)<br>  <br>  either way its your choice since its your characters life depends on it ^^|`|ZG6DeAzPaa	Be a man, and kill her. But, if you screw it up your teammates will hate you. I like to run up with the shotgun and shoot her in the face. Man, that sounds kind of messed up when you type it out like that, lol.|`|BwsTfgWaaa	What i did was on dead air i think. I was in the construction site and i saw the wtich.

BOOM, headshot.|`|mPuRl4tbaa	it doesnt really matter. if u have low life, walk around but if not shoot away.|`|TTHvg95vaa	walk around! unless you and your friends are really good with your guns, the witch is definitely going to kill, or at least injure really badly, someone. trust me, I've made this mistake, ha.|`|PvpCU2Bdaa	Either crown her by sneaking behind her with the auto shotty or throw a molotov and unload.|`|EDNJaGAxaa	you kill the witch by saying qeoiprgq['getet|`|cXX8iDDNaa	Auto-Shotty to the face ftw ;D|`|sb4dcv1oaa	KILL IT.|`|YvjPePdIaa	Check out Cricken 2 on youtube|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	When I first played it I ran up to her and waited for something happen trying to figure WTF she was.. This is also part my fathers fault.  He was watching and told me to stay put and wait <.<<br>  <br>  But I usually shoot off my  auto shotgun and run backwards at the same time.  Sometimes if my AI "friends" are far enough back I sneak run around her and wait to see which AI gets it.

LH7skT1Maa	Before i say you read this its not completely 100% i have played the game and own it but i haven't played for a long time.<br>  <br>  1. He must have got his mind wiped or there is a clip in the game which shows him and axel as friends maybe he done it to him.<br>  <br>  2. Roxas does merge with sora. Roxas was never supposed to exist and was living soras life.<br>  <br>  3. Just like sora in later fights he unlocks different modes for different fighting stances and stuff. Such as wisdom gives 2 keyblades and he shoots and dodges instead of hand to hand.<br>  <br>  4.I can't remember soz<br>  <br>  5. The heartless are the bad part of your soul and when your soul goes to far into the darkness u become one. In the first game he becomes one but is always happy as well. The nobodys are stronger versions of the heartless i think.<br>  <br>  6. Axel and Roxas used to be good mates in organisation 13 but when he lost his memory he never remembered axel. So because he didn't know him and Axel was so upset he must have wanted him to be changed back.<br>  <br>  7. Hes the main leader of organisation 13 i can't remember what he wants.<br>  <br>  8. Remember Roxas was living Soras life so everything he ever knew, or done was fake. But they were real after Soras brought back from his sleep and they seemed to recognise him. (There both merged together)<br>  <br>  9. King mickey must have gone back to rule the kingdom and u play a level as him with his own keyblade. I can't remember what happens and at the start of the first game Riku was jealous of Sora becoming so powerfull and being the keyblade master so he became the leader of the heartless. He must have realised that he didn't need to compete.<br>  <br>  10. I have seen a video on the internet of a future fight on a wasteland with battles from hundreds of keyblade users. So theres more than one. It doesn't show any facial images so we can't tell but theres three left. Search on youtube to see it.<br>  <br>  And if there is a game for ps3 coming out brillant i got a ps3 so im looking forward to it, i do think they already done before kingdom hearts on the ds game chain of memories.<br>  <br>  My email is tinydude15@hotmail.co.uk<br>  <br>  i will be sure to answer your questions and make my answers better. Hope this helps.|`|9xzRkH3Oaa	dude get a life what loser actually gets this into a game and besides play a real game like caoo of duty and u can actually kill some fooools|`|L0o3kp1waa	roxas is in the organization <br>  <br>  play number 1 for more and wait for the new ones

stYO4Q1Haa	no stardust dragons effect nolonger takes effect. stardust dragons effect only activates when a card that destroys a card(s) on the field.<br>  <br>  now if you have stardust dragon/assault mode you may activate the effect.<br>  <br>  but crystal abundance doesn't destroy it only sends to the graveyard meaning you cannot use cards like stardust dragon or sand moth. other cards that don't work on crystal beasts is hydrogeddon because monsters need to go to the graveyard to activate this monster effect.|`|2GWtU1JJaa	no because in order to be destroyed it is by result of battle. if it is sent to the graveyard by result of effect by either trap, magic, or monster's effect then it is simply sent there not destroyed.|`|tWVk1Ynoaa	yes|`|XiOfPxpdaa	i have crystal abondence and any card sent from the feild to the grave is destroyed that's the meaning of the card being destroyed so yes stardust dragon's efect will work althoe i think light and darkness dragon is better at this he's efect is the same exsept he looses 500 attack each time you use this efect insted of tributing himself and as a bounuse light and darkness dragon can revive a monster from your grave if he's destroyed so i think he gos for a much better call then stardust dragon and beside light and darkness has 2800 attack and is only 1 level higher|`|MPJYNAgqaa	No, Stardust's effect does not work at all.  Sending to the graveyard and destroyed are two different things.  If you were to tribute your crystal beasts for a tribute summon, their effect that allows you to bring them to your spell and trap card zone does not work since they were never destroyed, they were just tributed, same goes for cards that are sent to the graveyard.  Stardust Dragon's effect will only apply if the cards were "destroyed"

It sounds like you might be doing a couple things wrong.  Make sure you aim the sniper at the face and the rockets to the ground; and not the other way around.  Make sure you creep backwards wherever you go to make sure you dont get butted in the back.  <br>  <br>  It is important to remember that although the needler is a very good weapon, the mauler is better at medium range. <br>  <br>  Try and use the b button as little as possible due to the fact that they can shoot you while you're trying to butt them, and at the same time you can't shoot them.<br>  <br>  Try to stick to the best maps (epitaph, standoff, ghost town, isolation) and veto the gay maps (cold storage, the pit, blackout etc).  Make sure you always hope for team swords/hammers or CTF b/c those will lead to wins for you (from the sound of your game).<br>  <br>  I hope this all helps.  Another thing.  There is a guy out there named "A creditkard kid".  If you see this name, a grin will surely follow for he is a bigger noob than even you.

Hands Down, No Contest.|`|tt6PblaXaa	Its a tough answer. The PS3 is technically a monster powerhouse for graphics compared to the Xbox 360. But since the 360 has been out longer companies have found out how to use the system to amazing graphic advantages that are better sometimes thant he PS3. But the PS3 will eventually make huge gains in their graphics department. <br>  With that being said when it comes to games the 360 has a HUGE advantage over the PS3. Most games seem to look better on the 360 for now as its easier to program for. Plus XBOX LIVE is amazing compared to the Playstation Network. So.. my answer is the 360 is the better buy in my opinion. I have both systems..and although I love my PS3 i use my 360 more.|`|oj4NVp2naa	i own both the 360 and ps3 and i enjoy the 360 more but u do have to pay for the online but it is worth it. the ps3 has free online but its not as good. the 360 has achievements for every game while the ps3 only has it for select ones. the ps3 does have blu-ray and everything but the 360 has got netflix now. there is more downloadable content on the 360 than the ps3. both are good but...<br>  <br>  my vote goes to the 360.|`|AA10081665	I got both and for graphics PS3 but for more games X-box. I like it better online too even if it does cost and PS 3 doesn't. Now to really get the best graphics out of the PS3 you do need a HD TV and really a 1080p or you are wasting your money for sure, get the X-box then|`|oYtFcROfaa	get a ps3. <br>  if you add up the cost 4 everything the ps3 is sometimes cheaper.<br>  besides xboxes r crap versions of playstations|`|VCfhXFf6aa	LOL XBOX 360<br>  The best games (halo,GTA,gears of war, etc.)<br>  awesome online play (xbox live)<br>  overall awesome|`|oCMZ5txdaa	The games are better on the xbox, but the PS3 has the blu ray player

jYEbbrcaaa	You need to divide your town into acres. Just planting random trees won't do much good, but always plant flowers. Try this for a guide: <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=933195&topic=46790560" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessag...</a><br>  <br>  Grass disappears when you constantly run over it with your character. It basically shows common routes you take. Don't go the same way for a while and it'll grow back. This doesn't affect your town rating.|`|ye9h5jXvaa	The environment is tricky to get right. Basically you want about 12 - 16 trees per acre (an acre is 16 x 16 squares, giving you 25 acres in your town total) for a total of 350 - 375 trees. Plant flowers every day. You can literally never have too many flowers.<br>  <br>  The thing with the grass really sucks. I had exactly the same problem, so I put down a series of designs as paths across my town and now only walk on them. I'm currently waiting to see if the worn grass will grow back, but I don't think it will. It looks like Nintendo got this part completely wrong, because you could easily end up with a grass-free town after a few weeks.

World of Warcraft is THE best MMORPG (massive Multiplayer online roll playing game) out there. TONS of people are online all the time. almost every other character in the game is another live person sitting at a computer on the other side. you can play it for different reasons: personally i love it because of the people. most people are in guilds. which are groups of people who go around killing stuff. it is quite fun to hangout with other people online.  when you first start, you are a level 1. you can level ur character to level 80. in the game u can fish, make armor and cloths to sell, buy a horse, or mount, debate about social issues on the trade channel, and thats just the beggining. it is truly an amazing game.<br>  <br>  the only bad side is that it costs $15 a month (which isnt that much if u think of it as a hobby) and the upgrade to the new expansion is like $40 (which u wont need till level 70) <br>  <br>  if you do decide to buy the game, its best to buy the starter pack. it gives you 2months i think of free playing time. and the game along with the 1st expansion (there are currently 2 expansions out... one that expanded the level cap to 70, and another to 80.)<br>  <br>  o one last thing.. the best way to figure out if u like the game or not is to find a friend that plays, start a character on their account and level it.. then u will know whether or not its worth $15 bucks a month.<br>  <br>  Well, i hope this helps. good luck!<br>  <br>  o... runscape is pretty cool i guess. its free so it beats WoW there. but i stil think world of warcraft is way better.|`|UnYmDWepaa	theres a game i love to play its called literati, it really helps your spelling and is a challenge when your playing four people at once|`|CxPO6FwYaa	Bowman|`|vmh97tcJaa	Soldier front at ijji.com.

Or you could go to the Nintendo Event and do it the legit way, but hey, that's no fun is it?

I asked like 4 questions the same as yours and everyone says Fable 2.|`|6OfPqtAkaa	The best games for the 360 are by far the call of duty series. Mainly CoD 4 and The new CoD 5 if your looking for a good online experience. However if your looking for a game that will entertain you forever get  Elder Scrolls: Oblivion best RPG on the planet|`|gY4oyLqCaa	Tomb Raider Underworld, is a brill game.

uctxzjIIaa	That is correct. A Wiimake of Metroid Prime, in a similar vein to what RE4 got. Nintendo anounced the "New Play Control" line a while back, with 8 games in the initial batch, including the first two Metroid Primes and the first two Pikmins.

59AZ4GKVaa	Ok, in my opinion I would prefer to have a tommy gun because the chamber (the circle "magazine" that feeds into the gun) makes the bullets come out faster. I also like the sniper rifle because I have went once hunting & I used a sniper with a scope lens, this rifle shoots the target from far away. Oh, and how could I forget the paintball gun that my bro-in-law lends me when we go out for a match, it's basically a full-auto gun, which a switch to change how many bullets I wanna shoot, like you know, to ensure more ammo. Well, those are my faves !!

02WnhLpeaa	Alpha, Beta Testing.<br>  <br>  "Paid to Play" gamers.  It requires 2 things, one you need to be a good typist and two you need to be a DAMN good video game player.<br>  <br>  No not the video game player that can beat his little brother at super smash bros, i'm talking good enough to take ANY game home, and beat it with-in 72 hours.<br>  <br>  If you can do all that, then you still might be making horrible wages.<br>  <br>  The best way to get into it, is find MMO's in alpha/ closed-beta testing and BEG to be let in.  Lie if you have to, just get in.  Why?  So you can start building your resume as a video game tester.  Do that a few times and make it look like you know what your doing.  Then contact a random company that produces games (try blizzard) and submit your resume to them, and mention that you would love to fill out long reports about glitches and bugs.<br>  <br>  Age: MMO - about 16-17 min.  Blizzard Entertainment - 18<br>  Pay: Commission.  Pay per Review.  And the MMO's you were beta testing, well you just did that out of the kindness of your heart.  Though really, you can make 'decent' wages... but dont quit your day job, if you catch what i mean
XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  1. When playing as France, focus on strengthening your economy and bulking up your forces early on. Don't put to much effort into occupying rebel settlements. If you can somehow manage to overtake them with minimal loses, do so.  <br>  <br>  2. You need a good mixture of castles and cities throughout the whole game. Construct forts at the boundary of your empire, so that the enemy must penetrate them before moving deeper. Better units can also be trained from citadels when you upgrade.<br>  <br>  3. When you first begin at 1080 AD with France, it's a good idea to stock up on cavalry. A high number of 'mailed knights', in conjunction with some 'militia spearmen' can make a formidable regiment. Of course, a General is a must have, as he rally's the troops providing morale, solace and support. If you find you need an edge in combat, employ some 'peasant archers' or 'mercenary crossbowmen'.<br>  <br>  4. Your biggest threats will probably be Milan, the Holy Roman Empire and Portugal. These are the three factions which have the potential to destroy you, or apply extreme pressure. The type of gaming experience will vary depending on the difficulty setting though.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Tips: <br>  <br>  * France is a great nation to command, because they're geogrpahically situated very well. To the west is the ocean, and to the East is a large landmass to conquer. However, I suggest you invade Spain first, annexing weak areas like 'Pamplona', 'Leon', 'Toledo' and 'Valencia'. They should give you the financial bonuses appropriate for economic growth and prosperity.<br>  <br>  * When fighting battles, always attempt to flank or somehow surround your foes. Horses are a valuable tool, they're fast moving, heavily armoured and dangerous against infantry - use them wisely. Foot soldiers will comprise most of your army usually. They are the heart of your contigent. Keep them well protected and make sure they stick together. Siege weaponary later on can be deadly - not just against buildings, but also against people. <br>  <br>  * Diplomacy is often useless. Don't bother making alliances that won't last. Usually your "friends" will just backstab you at the most inconvenient times, and for no reason at all. Initiate trade rights and exchange deals/words of trust with other countries to lift your reputation. Remember that spies and assassins are cheap but handy. An advanced and stealthy shadower can murder the King of your opposition without a fuss! He can also burn down churches, stables and other important structures.
llEdx8Q2aa	1. Have them close their eyes and pick out stuff from a friends closet, then they have to wear it in public even if it doesn't match.<br>  <br>  2. WHo can go without shaving for longest time? I remember a few of my friends doing that it was so gross lol. <br>  <br>  3. Having to say yes to a question for a whole day, no exception lol.

It has stunning graphics, unlimited game play, and some really fun a$$ missions. <br>  <br>  Bully Scholarship Edition is like GTA but less violent. It is very fun too and with endless game play. <br>  <br>  Midnight Club: LA is superbly fun too. They have some sweet cars on there and the graphics are pretty good.<br>  <br>  Far Cry 2 is by far the best graphics game I have seen in my life. They pay attention to every detail. if you shoot a rocket Launcher at something it will catch fire and will even spread around burning anything it touches!<br>  <br>  If you want to destroy a lot of things then Stranglehold is the way to go. Everything and I mean everything is destructible! <br>  <br>  Burnout Paradise is a fun game to reduce stress. This game too has Unlimited game play.<br>  <br>  There are so many great options I could be here all day but the games I listed above are must buys. Go to Amazon.com to get them a lot cheaper then they are in stores.|`|mK3XsYEIaa	I would recommend Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 for first person shooter games. They are really fun and are even better online. Left 4 Dead is another good first person shooter and the absolute best zombie game.

BfgB6l8Qaa	I dont think you can download the sims, you have to buy them. Although you can download extras such as cars and hairstyles.

Zjjnv2Teaa	If you have bought the new game 'Halo Wars' in collectors edition, you will also get the mythic map packs with it!

gu6v2BUIaa	You should just get a stadium off these sites; www.ebay.com , www.theintoy.com , www.toywiz.com<br>  And it would be considerd 'Illegel' to use a home-made stadium and would also effect the beyblades completely.But if you really are  desperate just use a bowl of some sort.<br>  (Note:Beyblades will hopefully be back in the stores all around the world by 2010 titeld under 'Metal fight beyblade' and there is a really popular beyblade forum called www.worldbeyblade.org )|`|H0QPKkXvaa	You should definitely consider ordering from other websites, like Yahoo! Japan Auctions. Also, right now, TAKARA-TOMY has started producing a new Beyblade series called Metal Fight Beyblade which everybody should support by buying the new beyblades. <br>  <br>  Because building your own stadium would make you play 'illegally' anyway.

ef31622afe2e22cbfa13414f8bbb6b0caa	Unlike the first three answerers who are being asses and not answering the question, it all depends on personal preference and skill. I'm more attracted to the variety in Yoshi's attacks, so I think he's a better character. I suck at playing with Snake. But does that mean he's a horrible character? I'm just not used to his fighting style or movements. My best characters are Zelda, Samus, Pokemon Trainer, and Meta Knight. EVERY single character is good. It depends on the controller's skill.|`|mK3XsYEIaa	I would have to say that Mario is the better fighter. Mostly because he has a third jump and yoshi doesn't. Thats what always gets me. Also, Yoshi has that egg roll (haha) move that also always kills me. But everybody is good with a character, just because i suck with him doesnt mean that everyone sucks at playing with him. I myself am more of a Samus and Pikachu fighter, while other people can't play as them. So its all up to your skills and how you use them.|`|IeLBIACaaa	Metaknight and snake are the 2 best characters far and away.  this is not an opinion its a fact.|`|p4cgonKCaa	yoshi sucks<br>  marth is the best<br>  <br>  yoshi sucks give me another thumbs down.<br>  :]<br>  <br>  YOSHI sucks|`|vahn499Raa	wolf and toon link are the best

You do lose 5 points for asking, but if you end up picking the "best answer", you get back 3 of those points, so you only lose two.<br>  <br>  Also, you can vote on undecided questions. You get 1 point for each vote. If you're bored, just vote alot.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Answer as many questions as best as you can.  Best answers (voted by the asker) get 10 points..... and regular answers get 2 i think, but if you have a question be careful not to ask if it isn't very important, you lose 5 points for asking.

7sdK02CBaa	The most challenging and fun type of character to create is the melee character.  The way the AI is set up in Fallout 3 makes getting close enough to hit someone challenging and at the same time very fun.  When you are using a weapon like a power fist or super sledge, killing a super mutant or deathclaw both in and out of VATS is so satisfying.  Also, you can get the paralyzing palm perk which provides you with endless sources of fun.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	I thought about the ninja character with the melee using shishkebab and maxxing sneak, but I don't have the patience since I just bought the game and am still trying to beat it with my run and gun guy! Everytime I get bored of shooting, though, I think about it, especially since a lot of the time I lure them around corners to head shot them and I could see melee being kind of fun.|`|I4V4q2FEaa	i would try maxing out your luck skill thing and use the luck based perks.

585omdZzaa	First off; you need to get rid of executor. Executor will die of a dark/ghost on the champion and during the fire level.My advice would be to get a torterria because it's grass/ground so it can hold it's own against the fire type.<br>  <br>  Secondly; Crobat would be a poor choice in flying because the fourth person has psychic types. My advice would be to get starraptor or honacrow.<br>  <br>  Third; you don't need a electric type that much. A good grass type is what you really need. It would only work well when you use it on spiritomb.<br>  <br>  Other than those; its a good team.|`|XMzicF0Xaa	Good team , but I think Espeon weak, she'll be like the bench warmer in your team , try training a nosepas and make it evolv or gengar or a magnezone , but your team is good ^^ ^^|`|AA12071039	Your Espeon needs to learn Psychic and Morning Sun.|`|PB78Q75saa	good team|`|g1dhmz5Naa	1) Empoleon - there is no need for both Surf and Hydro Pump, keep surf, and replace hydro pump, because hydro misses a bit, and has low PP<br>  <br>  2) Crobat - no need for 2 flying moves... replace one<br>  <br>  3) Ninetails - no need for 2 fire moves... replace Fire Blast<br>  <br>  4) Luxray - replace Thunder with Thunderbolt, and get a better move than tackle<br>  <br>  * Fire Blast, Thunder, Hydro Pump.... anyone that is serious with pokemon battles know that FlameThrower, ThunderBolt, and Surf are much better because more PP, and they dont miss<br>  <br>  * there is no need for 1 pokemon to have 2 moves of the same type... that is a waste of a space, u want to have a range of moves so that no1 can wall u with a guy who is immune to the types u have, and u wanna be able to super effective anyone... so the wider the range of types, the better<br>  <br>  * if ur just looking to beat the leauge... this is fine...<br>  but i used to play competitivly... so i know these things<br>  <br>  *** my spelling sucks|`|8p8Hy3YBaa	They sound pretty good.|`|w4qS66aqaa	yeah really good team :] i suggest leveling them all to about 60 though

For that trick go to you tube and type in Red ring of death towel trick.|`|g1dhmz5Naa	1) if u send it to microsoft, u have to pay money for them to fix it<br>  <br>  2) there are many tricks that u can do to fix the RROD, but some void the warrenty (so u cant send it in) or only work for like a week (if at all)<br>  <br>  3) there is probly a buisness around where u live that can fix it, or u can google some1 to fix it (they look for common problems and fix it for u) which costs alot less than sending it to microsoft|`|wc0zNAd6aa	The towel trick is a temporary fix and can produce moisture within the case.

I had it in an xbox a few weeks ago, and it shows you what the error code is (usually starts with an 'E' - mine was E74) and depends on how many qaudrants of the power ring are lit up. If 3 lights are lit, then you can get it repaired by microsoft for free, but if not you might have to pay to get it repaired.

For example, the level 80 gun requires 80 STR, level 70 requires 70 STR, etc. Gunslingers can be lower their STR a bit though, as long as they have enough overall STR to equip their guns.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	First of all I have no idea what you are saying when you say post up to date? Threatening people is not a good way to get an answer to a question. I presume you mean the 1957 5 Pesetas from Spain. That date is an authorizing date and not the date the coin was struck. That is in a star on the coin. For many years Spain used a strange system of dating coins. The 2 numbers in the six pointed stars are the actual date. The coin is no longer legal tender for Spain now uses the Euro. On the coin that is marked BK where the star on the left was is rare and is worth around $10 and up depending on grade. The 1963 issue is worth around .50 and up. The rest can be found in a coin dealers world coin box for .10 cents.
127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	I am guessing you mean the 1976 $2 note that came out for the bicentennial. A lot were taken to local post offices, had stamps put on them and then were canceled. Depending on the post office some cities are more famous than others, due to there history, they sell for from $6.95 to around $10. The first federal $2 note was issued in 1862 which I bet is before your grandmothers time. Hope this helps.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	um i would say $2|`|4GrNT9YSaa	Well it says 2 dollars on it so probably two dollars|`|705r8NECaa	Like.. um.. around 2 dollars ?

zKMvdGruaa	High Percision Inner barrels and Tightbore are the same thing. <br>  The best overall grouping/accuracy/FPS improving barrel is Prometheus but there barrels are 50-60$<br>  The best Sniper Inner barrel is Dee's Custom Barrels (DCB/DBC????

x2Gl6EM7aa	Call the theater you want to go to. That's your best bet or go to there website. Keep on trying because the movie doesn't come out until Friday so they may not have them posted yet. Try www.movietickets.com or www.fandango.com|`|cMHTVMpMaa	Check postings for Friday instead of today as technically the movie is not to be released until tomorrow.
paHjJrrdaa	I have 2 agree with the first response, however it is still good! I LOVE RE!  I have RE5 pre-oredered! I loved the PS3 demo and can't wait to see what else the game has in store for us! So far though RE4 is still my favorite! I beat it like 4 times!!!!|`|5WMBekaAaa	These at least one huge problem with the story line: Wesker DIDN'T want the plagas to spread and that why he got Ada to retrieve them from Sadler.
JivLAZH6aa	yeah you can
LOhAUYrCaa	The little Alma is how she was when she was taken into Project Origin and locked in the Vault, so pretty much when hell started for her.<br>  The older Alma is how she looked when she died, about 16-18 years old. I'm not sure why she's nude, though...<br>  The younger Alma isn't dangerous but the older Alma is, and shows up a lot more in F.E.A.R. 2 as her older version.<br>  In the first game, Alma is the mother of Paxton Fettel, the psychic man that controls the replica soldiers, and you need to kill him. You ( the character playing ) are Alma's other son, so Fettel is your brother.<br>  In the second game, which is going on at the same time and right after the first game was, Alma takes control over you a bit for some time, then starts to become attracted to you. At the end, she rapes you while giving you hallucinations, and becomes pregnant  with your child ( Remember, in F.E.A.R. 2, you are a different man, not Alma's son. ).<br>  <br>  So there is definately going to be a F.E.A.R. 3...<br>  But, I hope that helped you.<br>  :3<br>  It's a great game, isn't it?!<br>  Heehee!<br>  <3|`|I4V4q2FEaa	ok me and a few of my friends had a talk about this... in the first game... the girl is your mother. and in the second game i dont know what she is. but she is attracted to you because you have a high telestetic signature. (or whatever they call it) she gave birth to you in the first one when she was 15 years old and she is showing herself to you as a mother in the end of the first one. That game still has me confused. lol i hope this helped a little bit.. if you have an xbox i can talk to you about it ecause i got this book from pre ordering it that tells you a lot about her.
G3hTM9qeaa	You don't need to transfer it. You can log in to your account on the worldofwarcraft website using the username and password that he uses to play and download the entire game to the new computer at no additional charge.|`|evB63qWvaa	I believe that once you buy it from online, you will be able to download it as many times as you want since you have bought it.  Simply log into your account and download it onto the new computer.
JS811Z4waa	well i think that they should add more Heroes to it, add customizable infantry, improved online play, melee, customizable weapons, they should make a longer campaign, and customizable Jedi/Heroes. I would love for there to be a Star Wars Battlefront 3 it would be amazing.
DHiqm9Ojaa	I luv that game! But i'm sorry to here that!=( Maybe you can use ur moms computer. Or u can...um...I'm not so good with computers. Wait! I know what you can do!

TqLXDAEOaa	GTA IV the Lost & the Damned is exclusive to xbox 360, as will the second episodic expansion be.<br>  Microsoft paid in the region of $50,000,000 for exclusivity, there are no plans for DLC for the playstation 3 version.|`|T7QeTZwCaa	The first person to answer is right, it is an exclusive. Microsoft paid 50 million for it. The reason for doing so is probably so that more people would buy the 360 version.|`|od51qzQtaa	I have already got some GTA downloads for the PS3 I got it froma site i use to get full games and movies. Its a really good site|`|37rVcF51aa	i am just agreeing with the guy above me. It will NEVER be available on the ps3. That was publicized before the game was even available for pre-order.<br>  Sorry if you own the ps3 version.
AA10595247	It will not work with those graphics. It won't even move with expansions. You need a dedicated video card with 256mb or better. Also, since you are running Vista, you're going to need a lot more CPU power than you already have. One gig of ram may be ok for just the base game with an upgrade to your processor speed and video card, but Vista uses a lot of memory, so 2 gigs would be better.<br>  <br>  See this chart <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:System_Requirements/MTS2_Recommendations" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a>|`|438f473be46cc5289e5c24b78adac392aa	Yes it should work...the requirements on the box of the game are the minimal requirements...if you have something better it will work.
FMAHqwpbaa	silver daxter psp limited edition is my favorite: it comes with daxter for the psp, and the family guy freakin' sweet collection, and i love the color|`|m2eHPeciaa	black is the best... it jus looks more sophisticated|`|AA10334145	i like the silver psp better i just think it looks more stylish but we all did like the black ones before the others came out|`|Ezm1ORwYaa	Black is better because if it gets dirty, its not so noticeable while a silver color get squalid (dirty) so easily (dirt and dust on it are so noticeable and if you were a perfectionist, you'd have to be cleaning your PSP all the time).|`|fDmRboaiaa	Black =3<br>  Idk, it just looks cooler.
K1BMovMTaa	Well, here is the question. Would you rather shoot animated characters on the television, or would you rather shoot a real person out in the woods and have an awesome laugh about it later?<br>  <br>  Go for the paintball gun. Get your friends to get one too. Go to a paintball field and enjoy life!<br>  <br>  PS3 is really nice, but getting outdoors with friends is even nicer!|`|ktbyKKK9aa	Ok, so I have both and like my PS3 and Paintball very much.<br>  Paintball is the most expensive sport out there, with a pack of 2000 balls at $50 and entry fees for parks at $15. Playing paintball can be really fun and a blast with friends. If you play paintball at least onceor twice every two weeks, then get the paintball marker(Officilal name is marker, not gun.)|`|RQzsmvfiaa	If you are a gamer, get a PS3. If you are outgoing and love to play outdoors, get a paintball gun. I would get a PS3, because I like gaming and it has a good variety of games. Also, built-in Blu-ray drive.<br>  <br>  Think about it and I hope you make the best decision. Good luck.|`|vAjXUYKaaa	Depends. Theyre both a bunch of make believe sorta.<br>  Id get a ps3 though. You can do alot more with it.<br>  <br>  Cheers Romo.|`|bRJRKBn1aa	ps3 of course. paint ball gun is not even close to ps3. ps3 is the best.
xHOuITo9aa	You can't have an adult marry a college or teen, without a hack. It's possible the girl is still stuck on college age. You need to some how age her. >.<' I have no idea save to go back into the college and see if you can't control people at the greek house. Get her to graduate and go from there. Another thing is to have her invite him over to the greek house *yes even though he is now back in the normal neighborhood* and see if it works then. Wish ya luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: How high is their relationship? You may not have them close enough yet for such an option to appear. If that's not the case I'm really not sure. I was confused by your question cause it sounded like you were trying to get them married not moved in. Apologies.|`|nsPYVqoPaa	An adult can not marry a young adult in uni.  I did the same thing, and it is one of the glitches they fixed in Freetime, now when your sim grows up and graduates, you get the option to get other sims he is friends (or engaged to) to grow up with him.<br>  Your only hope is to break them up, by making them mad at each other and finding another girl for him.  Unless she is a playable sim, then you could go in and play her till she graduates.|`|TEiyxEeCaa	she is still a young adult. she needs to either graduate of leave college and move back to a regular town. she must be an adult.(the same age as your male to get married.) not a young adult.|`|ZXkmsCT4aa	Try having the male, inviting her over, where he makes her a dinner then they watch tv, make out or something, then see if it works, if not then im not sure.
kBb1n5PXaa	go grinding on monsters. run people through instances for money. also one time my friend (male) made a female night elf and danced with no gear on and people tipped him. (yes there are desperate people out there)|`|DtkLsetkaa	Just go on a skinning spree.  Sell ALL of it on the AH and don't worry about leveling your LWing for a bit.   Combine scraps into pieces and sell them that way.  Sell anything else you get on the AH and don't buy anything.

dQj0wMRpaa	far cry 2 is a open world fps and is pretty fun and has amazing graphics, but has a ton of travel between action.  Fear 2 has amazing action and an amazing story and average graphics.  I personally like fear 2 but I liked fear 1.  P.S. I also like far cry: instincts, predator etc but far cry 2 strays a long way from the others.|`|wPBfydYhaa	Well from what i played of fear 2 its a good game but nothing really noteworthy, the story and horror does hold up the game from other first person shooters though. Far cry 2 is a really long game, tons of stuff to do. But i have to say the story isn't very compelling you don't get sucked into what really happening in the game until the the very end. IF your looking for a better story go with fear2 if your looking for the long single player game go with far cry 2. Also one more thing i know both games multiplayer are pretty mediocre, just wanted to add that so you don't choose a biased opinion on which has a better multiplayer|`|CauB3Gdxaa	Defintly fear2! FARCRY IS good at first but loses it's spark after a while (u eventually realise that all you do is drive). But fear 2 is fun that lasts 4 eva!!! (plus it's really spooky) :)|`|FH2rD2aUaa	fear 2 its awesome haha im two scared to go to the next level and ive had it since the first day but im far dont worry its a long game
dQj0wMRpaa	That sux I just got mine back 2day. The best answer I can give is: Have microsoft send you the box and shipping label, they give u all u need to send safely.  However if you already chose to print a label, than make sure the box is not huge bcuz u want to pack it snugly but leave enough room for quite a bit of bubble wrap and or packing peanuts because MS will be using UPS and they generally ignore Fragile instructions I.E. Mine came back 2day and the box was battered to hell but it was packed well so its fine.  sorry to hear it Good Luck.
