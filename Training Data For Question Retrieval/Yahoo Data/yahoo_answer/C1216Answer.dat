Chama-se hermafrodita (do nome do deus grego Hermafrodito, filho de Hermes e de Afrodite  respectivamente representantes dos gneros masculino e feminino) a um ser ou animal em que cada indivduo possui rg?os sexuais dos dois sexos.

Existem plantas que d?o flores hermafroditas e vermes que s?o hermafroditas, mas em humanos o hermafroditismo  considerado anormal. Cada pessoa nasce com um sexo definido, com horm?nios sexuais e caractersticas prprias determinadas de acordo com o seu sexo.    1- sementes provenientes de plantas herma dar?o origem sempre a plantas herma?Existe a possibilidade de germinarem-se machos ou fmeas desssas sementes?  2-as plantas macho geralmente entram em flora??o antes das femeas..em se tratando de uma planta hermafrodita as flores macho apareceriam primeiro tambem? ou tudo ao mesmo tempo.  3- existe a possibilidade de "castrar" a planta herme retirando-lhe as flores macho e conservando apenas as flores femeas?(caso a pergunta 2 seja afirmativa)  4-  possivel identificar atravs das pr-flores quais seriam as flores macho e as flores femeas em um hermafrodita?        1 - Na teoria, qualquer fmea que seja stressada at um certo limite, acaba por mostrar flores macho, podendo ser ent?o identificada como hermafrodita. Uma semente dessa planta, se tiver a mesma gentica da "m?e" pode dar a origem a uma planta fmea pura, caso nesse cultivo j n?o haja stress para a planta. Neste caso, em que uma planta mostra tra?os de hermafroditismo depois de ter sido (propositadamente ou n?o) submetida a stress, considera-se que o hermafroditismo n?o estava presente na gentica e a descendncia pode muito bem n?o dar origem a plantas hermafroditas. No entanto, para uma planta hermafrodita j de gentica, se a deixarmos produzir flores macho que libertem plen e polinizem as suas flores fmeas, as sementes originadas por esse processo ter?o uma grande probabilidade de dar origem a plantas igualmente hermafroditas.    2 - Sim, geralmente os machos mostram o sexo primeiro que as fmeas. As hermas que tive at hoje, obviamente mostraram primeiro o sexo feminino, caso contrrio teriam ido logo para o lixo. J guardei um ou outro macho durante 1 ou 2 semanas depois de identificado e nunca nenhum produziu flores fmeas. Em princpio o que te acontecer um dia que tenhas este azar,  pensares que tens uma fmea e passados 10 ou 20 dias de estar a formar flor, encontrares algumas flores de macho no meio das flores de fmea. De resto n?o te sei dar uma resposta concreta  tua pergunta.    3 - Sim, h fmeas que produzem relativamente poucas flores macho e nessas  possvel arrancar as bolas e ficar atento para ver se aparecem mais. Por vezes nem voltam a aparecer mais bolas, mas noutras situa??es torna-se incontrolvel porque as bolas chegam a nascer de dentro das flores fmeas. Se as primeiras flores que encontras s?o flores de macho o melhor  n?o te meteres a arrancar as flores s espera que comecem a aprecer flores de fmea. Nesse caso cortas logo a planta e metes outra.    4 - Bem, essa pergunta n?o percebi bem. Mas sim, as pr-flores s?o como "amostras" das flores que se v?o formar em seguinda. A pr-flor fmea  um pstilo (um pelinho) branco/transparente e uma pr-flor macho  uma bola que nasce perto de um n, est ligada ao ramo da planta por um pzinho e quando se abre larga polen e fica com o aspecto de um cacho de bananas.

You have     Area = ( e^8x-e^4x ) dx from x=0 to x=1 .    This is 1/8e^8x - 1/4 e ^4x evaluated from 0 to 1.    This gives you 1/8e^8 - 1/4e^4 + 1/8 .|`|bYZQho88aa	dude... this is simple.....    use a scientific calculator if u have or else use the calculator in windows.    find values of y=e^4x and y=e^8x  for values x=0,1,2,3,4,5....    and plot the obtained values in the graph.    Then draw a vertical line at x=1  there will be a region enclosed int it and the area can be found  too by taking any particular co-ordinate from the curves and lines. use two slips and double integrate it to get the area!!!      ....

SHXirIK1aa	A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  But since the points of tangency are the endpoints of a diameter, the radii to the points of tangency are simply the two halves of that diameter, which means that the diameter is perpendicular to both tangents.  And since the two tangents have a common perpendicular, they must be parallel.|`|IekdcERsaa	It's sometimes difficult to prove something this obvious isn't it ;)  Especially, it seems so obvious that two lines, each perpendicular to the diameter must be parallel.    However, lets assume they aren't and lets denote the endpoints of the diameter as A and B, and the midpoint of the diameter as O.    Now, if the tangents aren't parallel, then they must eventually meet at come point C off in the distance somewhere.    Now as these are tangents at the ends of the diameter, we know the angles they make OAC = OBC = 90 degrees and, because the tangents meet at C we have formed a triangle ABC where the angle BCA is non zero even if very small.    So we have just constructed a triangle with a total interior angle of > 180 degrees, which is impossible.  Hence our assumption that the two tangents meet is absurd and so they must be parallel.|`|415f835dca30f2add33c6754b925b73aaa	Bare with me, it's hard to give the details without an actual picture.    Draw a circle.    Draw a diameter through that circle.    At each end of the diameter, draw a tangent to the circle (It should look like a big "I" with a circle through it).    You know that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. That means all those angles are right angles.    Opposite interior angles are equal if and only if two lines are parallel.    Thus the tangent lines must be parallel.    Just organize this into a two-column table. Shouldn't be too hard.|`|EF3W3qjzaa	Statement  |   Reason  a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to diameter.  |  Property of Circle Tangents    another tangent to other end of diameter is also perpendicular to diameter | Property of circle tangents.

Inversion exchanges the straight tangent lines, but if there was a point of intersection A of the straight tangent lines,   then we will have another point of intesection A', on the other side of the circle, such that A'=I(A).    But two straight lines cannot have two points of intersection.     Therefore they must not intersect at all.|`|qMMTzVFiaa	draw a circle and draw tangents from the end points of the diameter . then join the all lines to form a quadrilateral.    let the quad. be ABCD  then,  angle A = 90  angle B = 90  angle A = angle B  hence the angles are co- interior  therefore , the lines are parallel.

a3a5074999cbc867b5f0aeb63bbc3f15aa	Hi Angel!    The answer could be Lake Superior, or Lake Michigan and Huron together, or the Caspian Sea, depending on the characteristics required to call a body of water a "lake."    If a lake means a body of fresh water with an outlet running down to the ocean, Lake Michigan and Huron  have the largest surface area (at least during the current era).  Traditionally, Lake Superior is considered the largest, but Huron and Michigan together are actually bigger by some 14,000 square miles.  They're both at the same level and connected by the 5-miles-wide and 120-feet-deep Strait of Mackinac, so there's no reason other than tradition that Lake Michigan and Huron should not be reckoned as a single lake, and the largest, 45,400 square miles to 31,800 for Lake Superior.  Lake Victoria in Afria is third at 26,800 sq. miles.    Neither of these is the largest by volume, by the way.  Lake Baikal in Siberia is much deeper and contains more water, 5,700 cubic miles, compared to 3,000 cubic miles in Lake Superior and 2,000 cubic miles contained in Lakes Michigan and Huron together.    The Caspian Sea is salt water.  It is a "sea" because once the water runs into it, that's where the water stops.  Geologists call it an endorheic sea, one that does not drain into the ocean.  That's why it's a "sea" and not a "lake" Actually, the Caspian was once part of the world ocean, until earth movements blocked it about 5 1/2 million years ago.  It is what remains of the Tethys Ocean, a vast body of water rivaling the Pacific until continental drift closed it and only the Caspian was left.    It you were to go back 10,000 years, the largest of all was Lake Agassiz that occupied much of modern-day Minnesota, North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  Lake Agassiz was larger than all of today's five Great Lakes combined, and indeed larger than the Caspian Sea, 170,000 square miles to 143,200 for the modern-day Caspian.|`|18F1A6bQaa	The Caspian Sea.

AA11900069	With no calculator to hand, work out what the question is actually asking!         Firstly, work the equation out.             Calcium Hydroxide + Hydrochloric Acid = what exactly?                 Secondly, work out the RMM's of the involved compounds.  From here, work out what actual mass of Hydrochloric Acid was used - easy, as you have the volume and the strength of the amount used.  Check the ratio of HCl needed to neutralise a given amount of CaOH, and you have your answer!    Or chemistry isn't for you.
c7qtyfIZaa	OK, set it up with letters instead of names. Lets say that Pudge is 'p', Ace is 'a', and Christi is 'c'.    So if Pudge has three times as many apples as Ace, that means that Ace would have to multiply his apples by three to get as many as Pudge, yes?    3a = p    Ace has twice as many as Christi, so Christi would have to multiply her apples by 2 to get as many as Ace.    2c = a    Pudge has 12 more apples than Ace and Christi together. That means that if you add up Ace and Christi's apples, you'd still need 12 more to equal Pudge's.    a + c + 12 = p    So your equasions are:    3a = p  2c = a  a + c + 12 = p    We'll be working with this bottom one to figure out the others.  Replace p with 3a (since you know they're the same).    a + c + 12 = 3a    Now replace both a's with 2c (from the second equasion)    2c + c + 12 = 3(2c)    Combine    3c + 12 = 6c    Subtract 3c from both sides    12 = 3c    Divide 3 from each side    4 = c    So Christi has 4 apples. Plug that into the second equasion to find out how many Ace has, then use that to figure out Pudge's.|`|AA11298562	OK, set it up with letters instead of names.

(forgive unintentional pun)|`|AA11900069	And it is also useful for destructive purposes, such as sabotage - all that is needed is some aluminium powder, and some rusty steel!          These are not "explosives" as such, which can be sniffed by trained dogs or detecting machines such as used at airports and ferry terminals.          The Thermite reaction cannot be stopped once it has started - it is not really an explosion, but a high-speed, high temperature burning, where the Oxygen ions break from the Iron ions they were bonded to, and bond to the Aluminim atoms to form Aluminium Oxide, leaving Iron.  this can be used to join lengths of railway track together, if the powder is poured into a well-shaped mould. |`|cY45zrMCaa	Thermit reaction is a reaction which is mainly used to join two metals  It can be used in welding purposes  It can also be used in joining railway tracks
AA11900069	Not bad, but an etch-primer is better, such as Etchweld by Bilt-Hamber (they sell from their website) as red-oxide sits on the metal, but an etch-primer BONDS to the metal, chemically.   You could use Etchweld and then red-ox on top of it, and then use a top-coat of paint, as red-oxide is somewhat porous.  Use it alone, and rust will come through it.    |`|AA10875337	yes . this should be ok, since red oxide is used on iron surface to prevent its rusting. Further it clings to the base and helps regular paint to stick better .|`|L2rxDUbuaa	Red oxide primer is supposed to have rust-resisting properties, but I'm not convinced it's especially good (or bad) at resisting rust. It is a primer to be used on clean bare metal, not a rust treatment. You have to make sure you have removed ALL of the rust first with the wire brush or abrasive paper and then paint with the primer otherwise the rust will just come through. It's not a bad choice for what it's designed for and, as you got it free, you may as well use it. Ideally paint over it with a top coat when it's dry to match the rest of the car.|`|R7mnEUOZaa	I remember my husband always used this when repairing the floor of our old Moggie 1000
BBmwerJTaa	That'd be isotopes.  Same number of protons, different number of neutrons.    Ta.|`|AA11900069	You may be talking about isotopes, which are the same element, but in the nucleus of the atom, there are differing numbers of Neutrons.  Since neutrons have no charge, but a mass of one unit, this means that you can have the same element, but different weights for a mole of it.  Carbon, for example, has the commonly occuring C-12 isotope, which you and I consist of, and it also has C-13 and C-14.  Some isotopes never change, they are "stable", some have a limited lifetime, they DECAY into a stable isotope, releasing neutrons as they do so.  Something which can happen is that they change by releasing neutrons AND protons, which changes their atomic number, and therefore, the actual element!  All the heavy isotopes used in nuclear weapons and atomic power stations, are slowly, steadily, releasing sub-atomic particles, as they tick their way down towards stable Lead.  Some of them will take millions of years to do this, others will do so rapidly.|`|SpvgDXFPaa	They're called isotopes.  Although they have the same chemical properties, having the same number of protons and electrons, they have different atomic weight, due to a different number of neutrons in the nucleus.

WAUhdqVWaa	Wars have started because of water and food shortages, but those have all been in foreign countries.  That wont happen in your lifetime here in the states bro.  Yes, water is in a cycle of rain, stream runoff, oceans and evaporation.  Water can neither be created nor destroyed.  It can only change forms.  Even if rain stopped ( also which won't happen ), we have the oceans to tap.      The world is 70% water...      Clean fresh water supplies may get scarce as what happened to Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia either last summer or this summer.  Storms and rain hit, water was piped in from other sources and the drought problem was ( at least temporarily ) resolved.

JuCUl0lJaa	Yes. This is high for most of Southern England.|`|AA11900069	Yes, I would say so.

I suspect there may be slightly higher summits not much further west, in the chalk uplands around Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.    However, I would take a proper definition of "Southern England" as anything lying south of a line drawn between the Bristol Channel and The Thames Estuary.   This would include the "West Country" of Somerset, Devon & Cornwall, which have numerous ranges of hills (Quantocks, Exmoor, Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor) all of which have peaks considerably higher than 250m (the highest is High Willhays on Dartmoor at 621 m).    That said, 250m is in general still pretty high for the majority of the south of England.
715f8a57435bf66b324f94e65dec6359aa	The sheep we have today are a result of thousands of years of *artificial* selection, ie breeding, by humans. Most of the things that enabled them survive in the wild, but which are no longer beneficial, have most likely been bred out over the years.    Even so, we do see some remnants which show how they would have previously survived.

Essentially, the heart's main function as you know is to supply oxygenated blood to the organs of the body and take unoxygnated blood to the lungs to be oxygenated (via pulmonary artery). The heart and love do however have a relation. When you  are in love typically you get excited and your sympathertic nervous system takes over and has various effects on the body. During this excitement your pupils will dilate, digestion essentially decreases, you get goosebumps (called piloerection), causes you to perspire, and increases your respratory rate and heart rate. If you get really excited when your in love or with the one you love, then yes your heart and love do have a connection|`|3029b27a303de71c5528ee94f4bb098baa	blood runs through.|`|IAMIxWAKaa	when you are around someone (or thinking about them) who you love you're heartrate may increase. also without you're heart you wouldn't be alive enough to love anyone. those are the only connections between love and your heart.|`|20KLaaoFaa	It pumps blood.

AA11474133	Not really an engineering question.  If you are asking about the national electrical code, the other answers are way off.  For general purpose lighting circuits, code requires a 15A circuit for 600 sq ft, so your house needs at least 3.  Then it will need a 20A laundry circuit, a 20A bath circuit, and 2 20A circuits for the kitchen/dining area.  The receptacles in these areas will not be on the 15A general purpose circuits.  There may be other 120V circuits for specific appliances.    Not in your question, but since other answers mentioned it:  the minimum size service is 100A for a house, and no (residential) panel made will have more than 42 spaces (a limit in the NEC).|`|80b8cc51687afa4b940b8a3d2bef0a46aa	The minimum for any new house is 208 volt, 200 amps.  The right distribution box will gave you 24 120 volt circuits.  Don't forget that things like a cook-top, oven and dryer require 208 volt circuits.|`|15ee8022af1079762dcb0b0ef09744f2aa	You would normally have a 200amp main panel in the house. This would usually allow for up to 50 circuits with 20 amp fuses. This changes though because some appliances need more than on circuit spot and will create a single 50amp circuit out of two spaces. The more high tech the house the more power you will need. Some people are having a 400 amp box installed to allow for future power usage expansion. Items like instant water heaters can use 1/4 of a standard size circuit panel by itself.
65f9c166639a6b751531ecd41a0fc311aa	A conventional DC electric motor has a fixed magnet and a rotating wire armature. Power is fed to the rotating armature (a series of wire coils) via brushes and a commutator. The purpose of the commutator is to switch power with the correct polarity to the correct windings to make the armature rotate.    In the brushless DC motor, the armature is replaced by a rotating fixed magnet and the fixed magnet replaced by a series of windings or coils. Current of the correct polarity to cause the armature to rotate is fed to the correct windings (coils) using solid state switches and a position sensor. All brushes are eliminated and the electronics allows for accurate positional and speed control.|`|AA11950087	Do a Google search for "step motor".   A motor with noisy brushes is a Universal motor that the brushes hit the coil and causes noise.  A Step motor is brushless and more quiet and rotates in steps.|`|AA11474133	You didn't say what kind of brushless motor.  The most common is the AC induction motor.  The field coils induce a current in the armature (like a transformer) which creates the magnetic field in the armature.  The interaction of that and the field coil's magnetic field turn the motor.  All big motors are 3 phase induction motors, including in diesel trains engines.
AA11474133	I'm not sure why nobody has answered this.    1) You know f-ma, right?  Two forces are equal so use m1*a1 = m2*a2.  The two masses are M and X (the unknown mass) and the two accelerations are a and 3a.    So Ma = X(3a)  Then X = Ma/3a = M/3  This is like story problems in math.    2) Have you stated the problem wrong?  If m is released and 3m is the one sitting on the table, it won't move.  If you really mean m is on the table and 3m gets released, the downward force due to gravity is 3mg, and the upward force due to the other mass is mg, so the net downward force is 2mg.  This causes acceleration of a=F/m = 2mg/m = 2g    For distance h, velocity v, and time t (constant acceleration, v=h=0 at time t=0):  v = at  h = at^2/2  (If you have calculus background, v is the derivative of h, and a is the derivative of v)    To get v in terms of h, solve second for t:  t = square root of (2h/a)  Then v = at = a * sq root of (2h/a) = sq root of (2ah)  Since a = 2g, then v = sq root of (4gh)    Do you see your mistake?  (Or did I mess up?  I double checked it)

AA12213891	Okay, this is an example of simple harmonic motion (SHM).If the velocity is zero after 0.5s, this means the period of oscillation (T) is 2x0.5s = 1.0sec. If the initial displacement is 0.1m, then the amplitude of oscillation (A) is 2x0.1m = 0.2m. The maximum speed of the object will be achieved when the displacement is 0. The equation for the displacement for SHM is:    y = Asin(2pift + pi/2) where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency = 1/T and disp = initial displacement, and t = time.    So the velocity is given by the time derivative of displacement:    v = Acos(2pift + pi/2) = 0.2cos(2pit + pi/2)    Now, since the maximum velocity is achieved after 0.25s (the max velocity is when the object passes through the origin which will be after half the time taken to reach the other end of the cycle);    v = 0.2cos(pi/2 + pi/2) = 0.2cos pi = -0.2m/s    qed|`|15ec59839f6401c70ff82989b8c9c7adaa	1.00-kg|`|d5f274e213cb4320d97231b1b3f1e838aa	T = 1 sec  f = 1/T = 1  V_max = A*2*pi*f = 0.1*2*pi*1 = 0.2pi m/sec

Existem diversos sistemas de compress?o. O mais comum  o de pist?o, outros s?o os rotativos e o de rotor com palhetas. O de pist?o funciona como o motor de um carro, baixando o pist?o, aspira, subindo, fecha a vlvula de admiss?o e abre a de escape para comprimi-lo para o tanque de ar. O rotativo  mais complexo. Um rotor cilindrico com canaletas com largura varivel. O ar  coletado numa extremidade em que as canaletas s?o mais largas, for?ando-o para a extremidade em que as canaletas v?o estreitando, portando comprimindo o ar. O de palhetas  composto por um rotor excntrico contendo palhetas de fibra colocadas em canaletas paralelas ao eixo do rotor. O rotor funciona dentro de um tambor, sendo que o eixo do rotor  deslocado em rela??o ao eixo do tambor. As palhetas deslocam-se no sentido radial do rotor, aspirando ar na parte larga e comprimindo na parte estreita. Sugiro uma pesquisa na internet para entender melhor o funcionamento.

TywkA301aa	Um tanto convincente, realmente, digno dos filsofos gregos pr-socrticos.     Mas seria melhor reformular de fontes para representantes, exemplos. Na verdade a fonte dos estados fsicos foi o Criador que os projetou. Estado fsico n?o  algo que algum elemento criado, astro ou coisa semelhante possa interferir ou inventar, veja que h um nmero taxativo (3). Ou se est lquido, ou se est slido, ou se est gasoso. E pronto.     O mximo que tais elementos podem fazer  mudar o estado fsico de um ser, pela transmiss?o de calor, mas a CAPACIDADE ESSENCIAL de os seres moldarem suas partculas fundamentais em nova disposi??o, ou darem-lhe nova velocidade,  inata e j vem de "fbrica" assim.    Se os estados fsicos proviessem de algum astro, como  sugerido, haveria, certamente, seres an?malos que n?o se submetem a algum tipo de estado fsico, pela anlise de combina??es. Algum ser haveria que n?o teria sofrido interferncia de algum desses astros. E isso n?o ocorre na natureza.    Quanto a quadro de combina??es h o exemplo dos tipos de sangue. H o tipo A, o tipo B, o tipo AB e o tipo O. Mostra-se aqui a existncia de dois padr?es distintos e quatro probabilidades, a influncia de um nico ( A, ou B, por exemplo) a influncia de amos os padr?es (AB) e a influncia de nenhum (O).

Were you to release a square cube of ice in the Space Station, the ice would soon melt and form itself into the shape of a sphere, the same as found in planets, moons and our sun.  If any of these large solar bodies were to have the mass that they presently have, and yet had no heat energy within them, they could be formed in to any shape and they would retain that shape.    The physics trilogy describes this force in action: E = mc2, m = E/c2, and c2 = E/m is the trilogy.  The last expression is that of a gravitational field, or a field of what we would call physical time - the two are the same.  Notice that it is a product.  It requires a mass energy relationship in order for a gravitational field to form.  Our planet expends 0.00444 kg./sec in order to keep everything in place, and our sun expends 665 lbs./sec in order to keep the planets in place.    http://360.yahoo.com/noddarc or http://timebones.blogspot.com have different, short writings concerning our physical world.

S?o animais homeotrmicos, ou seja, de "sangue quente".    O crebro controla a temperatura corporal e o sistema circulatrio, incluindo o cora??o (com quatro camaras). Os mamferos incluem 5.500 espcies (incluindo seres humanos), distribudo em aproximadamente 1.200 gneros, 152 famlias e at 46 ordens, embora isto possa variar de acordo com o esquema de classifica??o.    Como caractersticas distintivas, os mamferos possuem ainda:    glandulas sebceas que segregam uma gordura para lubrificar a pele;   glandulas sudorparas para ajudar na termorregula??o e excre??o;   a mandbula articula-se diretamente com o craneo;   o osso quadrado encontra-se transformado num dos trs ossculos da orelha mdia, enquanto que nos rpteis este osso encontra-se atrs dos outros ossculos;   os dentes apresentam uma estrutura complexa e est?o diferenciados em diversos tipos: incisivos, caninos e molares (ou molariformes);   possuem o diafragma, uma lamina muscular que divide o trax do abdmen, contribuindo para a respira??o.

c4UdZr6Faa	O capim  uma gramnea Angiosperma monocotiled?nea.  Produz flor, fruto e semente.  Em botanica s?o considerados como Angiospermas todos os vegetais que apresentam a semente encerrada no interior de um fruto. Nas Ginospermas as sementes s?o nuas, isto , n?o est?o encerradas no interior de um fruto proveniente do desenvolvimento do ovrio: ex: Pinheiro (pinh?o).  O maior problema para muitos  possuir um conceito errado para o que se considera um fruto.  O fruto  resultante do desenvolvimento do ovrio da flor aps a fecunda??o.  Pseudofrutos s?o originrios do desenvolvimento de outras partes da flor.  Chamamos de frutas todos os frutos que consumimos, geralmente como sobremesa. O tomate, pepino, quiabo, chuchu, s?o frutos mas n?o os chamamos de frutas.  O capim (gramneas  - trigo, arroz, cevada, centeio, milho, etc) produzem  frutos com semente em seu interior. Na maioria das gramneas o fruto  do tipo cariopse .Em linguagem popular chamamos de gr?o.   um fruto simples, seco, indeiscente, com uma s semente.  Seu tegumento  concrescido  com o pericarpo em toda sua extens?o. Geralmente apresentam endosperma abundante.

This means a force will act on a positive charge placed in the field and point in the direction of the field.    Now, your drop of water is suspended. So in which direction is the force acting on it to cancel gravity? {If you can answer this question you are doing your own homework! Other people's answers mean they are clever! Your own answer means you are clever!}    Now you know the direction of the electric force, what is the charge on the water drop then?    Why? (The answer is the first paragraph written above.)    (b)  One electron has a charge of e. The electric field is E. The weight of the drop is mg.    The downward force on the drop is mg  The upward force must be equal, and is given by eE    You have to do this yourself, as you have to look up what value e is, and g also, and then m and E are given.
R7vLklpfaa	The electric field is zero inside of any conductor that contains no charge.|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	The electric field is equal to the rate of change of potential with distance:  dV/dx      For a field due to a point charge Q    Then, you might know that V due to a point charge is   V  =  Q / (4 pi epsilon x)    So, electric field is E  =   d/dx  [  Q / 4 pi epsilon x  ]    Differentiate with respect to x and you get     E    =     Q  /  4 pi epsilon  x^2    Okay, E is zero when either Q is zero (no charge present) or when x is infinite (i.e. far, far away from the point charge)    Second Situation: The Potential V is Constant    Oh yes, there are places on earth where electric potential is not zero but constant. There is something called a Faraday cage. {Look this up on the internet}.  This is not a particular instrument or box or thing but any space that is like a room or a sphere whose walls are charged up to a potential V.    This means the walls, the whole interior of the room and the outside walls are at the same potential.      If V  = constant    dV/dx  =  0  (yes, zero!)    But electric field is dV/dx. So E = 0    Sit in an airplane struck by lightning, and you are in a Faraday cage. Yes! You are perfectly safe, even if you, the passengers, the stewardesses and the pilot are all at five million volts!  You see, you are in a region of zero electric field and there is no net electric force acting on you.    When the plane lands, it is another story. The plane is at five million volts too on the outside, and the tarmac is at ground or zero potential. The first thing that happens when the wheels touch the tarmac is a current zips from the plane to the ground through the wheels. Something is added to the wheels in its manufacture to make sure this happens.    Then the whole plane is no more at five million volts but ground potential, so everybody is safe in going outside.     If the wheels land on some puddle of gas on the tarmac? Hmmm. What do you think?

The two spheres will have all their charges at the surface, and no charges inside, whether it is solid or hollow.     Why? Fill in the blanks here:    The charges on each sphere distributes itself symmetrically and try to get away from one another because ... like charges ________.    Now, the surface of the spheres are at the same potential.   How can you know this? Because they are all static. If they were not at the same potential, then charges will flow from  ___________potential to   ____________potential.    So because they don't move, it is because the surface of the sphere is at the same potential.   Inside each sphere is an equipotential volume. Meaning the potential within each sphere is uniform, and equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.    The electric field is defined as the rate of change of potential with distance. E = dV/dx    But V is a constant. Hence dV/dx  =           ?  This is the Electric Field.    Outside the sphere, the electric field behaves as if the charges were located at the centres of the sphere. It is the same for either sphere, and decreases with distance from the centre of the spheres by the inverse square law.

cd47874abfce0d544811a7cb68a0a6c7aa	Yes... at least that's the thought based on our knowledge at present.  The universe is currently viewed as being constrained by a law of conservation of matter and energy; the two can be interchanged (as when an electron and positron "annihilate" to form energy), but can never be created or cease to exist altogether.  For example, matter and energy do not actually "disappear" in black holes, but are merely emitted from their margins as Hawking radiation (named for you-know-who).  The majority of mass in the universe is presently undetectable, however, hence its being termed "dark matter".  It is known to exist only because of the gravitation in the universe.    The prevailing model is now that the universe emerged from a single point 13.7 billion years ago, to expand to its present breadth via increasing entropy (which facilitates the non-linear nature of time as well, which is often perceived to render the question of what existed "before" the universe inapplicable, as time itself approaches non-existence as you move toward the dawn of the universe.)  But the point is that the same quantity of energy/matter were existent at that time as is at present, and will presumably continue to be.    So what will become of the universe?  Well, it is generally thought that at some point it will become so expansive, that matter (in the same quantity as now, mind you) will become completely distended, separated into elementary particles, with no more interaction (and thus no more life) possible.    So, is this the whole story?  Well, it's probably not the end of what humans will discover; on the contrary, we've probably only begun to speculate, to unearth the secrets of the universe.  But even if so, to me it seems logical that there will always be more to existence than we are capable of learning, or possibly even imagining; if at some distant point we reach the limit of human understanding and speculation, why would this even approach the limit of all existence and possibility?  After all, there has always been far more to existence than we knew in ages past, and I would expect this to remain true to the very limits of human capacities.|`|51988fa4a15bd232aeb398232fa48b41aa	Of Course Not|`|cd1393e034b635c775b8ed5ab028244aaa	yes its conserved|`|AA12104608	Yes, it is always constant...|`|NCESxqdqaa	Yes.Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.It can only be converted.|`|271VqIeWaa	no. but you already knew that (Hence your name)

En primer lugar, ya que la pregunta es un poco ambigua, hay que decir que la Luna s gira sobre su propio eje; teniendo lugar un giro completo en el mismo tiempo que le lleva dar una vuelta completa alrededor de la Tierra.

Para comprobar este hecho basta tomar un vaso y una botella con etiqueta; poniendo el vaso sobre la mesa y haciendo, ste, las veces de la Tierra, hacemos girar la botella sobre l de manera que la etiqueta lo mire siempre.  Veremos como, al tiempo que se produce un movimiento de traslacin alrededor del vaso y la etiqueta apunta hacia ste, se produce un giro de 360o por parte de la botella sobre s misma.    Por lo que respecta a la traslacin lunar, si un cuerpo no gira alrededor de otro, cosa imposible en nuestro universo, quiere decir que se desplaza en lnea recta; con lo que la Luna dejara de estar ligada a la Tierra y sta, adems de sufrir una drstica reduccin en las mareas, debido a la prdida de masa en el sistema Tierra-Luna que nos mantiene en nuestra rbita, sera atrada a otra rbita solar con terribles consecuencias para todos los seres vivos del planeta.

40c6ae177718f873df559febdf610381aa	A papoula  conhecida h mais de 5 mil anos - os sumrios j a utilizavam para combater problemas. Os antigos comiam a flor inteira ou a maceravam para obter o sumo. Na Mesopotamia, curavam-se doen?as como ins?nia e constipa??o intestinal com infus?es obtidas a partir da papoula.     A papoula foi muito conhecida nos tempos remotos, tinha muito prestgio entre os mdicos da Grcia antiga. Na mitologia grega era relacionada a Hipnos, o deus do sono, pai de Morpheu - que a tinha como planta favorita e, por isso, era representado com os frutos desta planta na m?o. H tambm uma estreita rela??o entre a papoula e a deusa grega Nix, a Noite. Deusa das Trevas, filha do Caos,  na verdade a mais antiga das divindades. Freqentemente, ela  representada coroada de papoulas e envolta num grande manto ***** e estrelado. Em muitas referncias ela se localiza no Trtaro, entre o Sono e a Morte, seus dois filhos. Os romanos n?o a representavam em um carro, mas sempre adormecida.     A papoula  conhecida h mais de 5 mil anos - os sumrios j a utilizavam para combater problemas. Os antigos comiam a flor inteira ou a maceravam para obter o sumo. Na Mesopotamia, curavam-se doen?as como ins?nia e constipa??o intestinal com infus?es obtidas a partir da papoula. Mais tarde, os assrios e depois os babil?nios herdaram a arte de extrair o suco leitoso dos frutos para fazer remdios.     Hipcrates foi um dos primeiros a descrever seus efeitos medicinais contra diversas enfermidades. H quem defenda que mais tarde, um mdico grego em Roma, padronizou a prepara??o do pio com uma frmula (o mitridato) e a receitava aos gladiadores. O uso do pio difundiu-se pela Europa no incio do sculo XVI, mas sofreu forte combate quando a Igreja Catlica come?ou a controlar os remdios. Foi por essa poca que Paracelso, o famoso mdico e alquimista su?o, elaborou um concentrado de suco de papoula - o ludano, que teria o poder de curar muitas doen?as e at de rejuvenescer. A dissemina??o desta cren?a levou  populariza??o do seu uso em todo o mundo ocidental. Com o tempo e com a expans?o das rotas comerciais, o pio acabou por se tornar uma droga universal.     Por volta de 1803, o cientista alem?o Frederick Sertuener, observando que os diferentes subprodutos da papoula produziam efeitos diversos, procurou isolar os elementos narcticos do pio. Assim, ele obteve um cristal alcalide de efeito muito intenso: era a morfina.     Dormideira        A papoula  uma planta da Famlia das Papaverceas, tambm conhecida como dormideira.  uma herbcea anual que apresenta propriedades alimentares, oleaginosas e medicinais. A planta apresenta um caule alto e ramificado, com folhas ssseis e ovaladas. As flores s?o grandes, brancas, rosas, violceas ou vermelhas, e o fruto  uma cpsula. Por toda a planta circula um ltex branco. Todas as partes da papoula s?o consideradas venenosas, com exce??o das sementes maduras.     O pio  retirado a partir do ltex encontrado nas cpsulas que n?o atingiram a matura??o. Ao se fazer cortes na cpsula da papoula, quando ainda verde, obtm-se um suco leitoso, o pio (em grego, refere-se a suco), que contm cerca de 25 alcalides - o mais importante deles  a morfina, presente em at 20% no pio.     Os nomes relacionados  papoula s?o bem sugestivos O nome cientfico da planta "somniferum" (relacionado a sono) e a origem do nome "morfina" (relacionada ao deus da mitologia grega Morfeu, o deus dos sonhos) nos levam a compreender os efeitos que o pio e a morfina podem produzir: s?o depressores do sistema nervoso central. Alm disso, o pio ainda contm outras substancias, como a codena, e  dele tambm que se obtm a herona, uma substancia semi-sinttica, resultado de uma modifica??o qumica na frmula da morfina.     Todos os alcalides do pio s?o narcticos. O maior problema dos opiceos  o seu poder de provocar dependncia. Tanto a morfina, como o seu derivado, a herona, criam uma euforia de sonhos, seguida de uma seda??o associada a uma sensa??o de bem estar. Entretanto, o uso constante e prolongado leva a um envenenamento cr?nico que pode causar deteriora??o fsica e at a morte.

A Ressonancia Schumann  a medida do comprimento de onda de energia existente neste campo da ionosfera.   Como o movimento  ondular, esta energia n?o est presente a todo o momento e tem que ser "excitada" para ser observada.   Ela n?o  causada por nada interno da Terra, seja de sua crosta ou ncleo.   Estas ondas parecem relacionar-se com a atividade eltrica da atmosfera, particularmente durante perodos de intensa atividade de relampagos.   Elas ocorrem em diversas freqncias entre 6 e 50 ciclos por segundo, especificamente 7.8, 14, 20, 26, 33, 39 e 45 hertz. Logo, como as propriedades do campo eletromagntico da Terra permanece o mesmo, estas freqncias permanecem as mesmas.   Presumivelmente, h alguma mudan?a devido o ciclo do p?r do sol , assim como a ionosfera da Terra muda de acordo com o ciclo de 11 anos da atividade solar.   A Ressonancia Schumann  mais facilmente vista entre 2000 e 2200 UT.   Dado que a atmosfera terrestre carrega uma carga, uma corrente e uma voltagem, n?o  surpresa encontrar cada onda eletromagntica.   A propriedade ressonante deste campo de energia, foi inicialmente prevista pelo fsico alem?o W. O. Schumann em 1952 e detectada por Schumann e Konig em 1954.   O primeiro espectro representativo deste fen?meno foi preparado por Balser e Wagner em 1960.

A moeda  colocada entre as duas garrafas para dar uma certa estabilidade  garrafa superior.   A moeda permite que a garrafa superior tenha uma rea maior para se manter na posi??o em que foi colocada e n?o cair. Sem a moeda, seria mais difcil fazer com que a garrafa de cima n?o caia, isso porque voc teria que centraliz-la corretamente em cima da outra garrafa e em uma rea bem menor que a da moeda.  Quando se retira a moeda, faz-se rapidamente. Isso  feito para que o atrito entre as garrafas e a moeda seja mnimo, fazendo com que uma vibra??o mnima v para a garrafa de cima. Caso a moeda fosse retirada numa velocidade reduzida, muita vibra??o iria para a garrafa de cima e a desestabilizaria, fazendo-a cair.  A garrafa superior deve estar cheia de gua para que a gua fa?a um certo peso sobre a outra, fornecendo maior dificuldade de movimenta??o  e tambm para absorver toda a vibra??o da retirada da moeda.

w1e6OGzNaa	Tinakula is a conical stratovolcano which forms an island north of Nendo in Temotu Province, the Solomon Islands. It lies at the north end of the Santa Cruz Islands. It is about 3.5 km wide and rises 851 m above sea level, but rises three or four km above the sea floor. It erupts approximately every hour in a plume of ash and rocks. The volcano was first recorded in eruption in 1595 when lvaro de Menda?a sailed past on his round the world voyage.    The island is uninhabited. A previous population was eradicated when the volcano erupted around 1840 and pyroclastic flows swept all sides of the island.    Transport can be arranged, but landing on the island is very difficult since there are few good beaches. One must bring plenty of water and be prepared to swim ashore. The island is covered with jungle, except for the western side, which is covered with ash. It was scraped by landslides in 1965. When the volcano erupts, it is possible to watch large boulders tumbling down the mountain side.    The island is in the range of the endangered Santa Cruz Ground Dove (Gallicolumba sanctaecrucis), but as ornithologists have not visited the island in a long period, it is unknown whether they survive there.

pgMepJ5jaa	H2 + Br2 --- 2HBr.    There are 2 atoms of hydrogen, and two atoms of bromine on the reactant side. Thus, you need the same side on the product side of the equation. The 2 on the products side (2HBr) distributes, so it would be like saying there are 2H and 2Br.    Saru, your answer is right. However your explanation isn't. Diatomic molecules alone have a neutral charge. On the products side, H has a + charge, Br has a - charge, so it cancels out.|`|aTmu4WEbaa	H2 + Br2 --> 2HBr    H has 1 proton  Br has 1 electron    They have to balance out to make the product neutral.

Sulphur has a valence of 2, 4 or 6,   Here, if we use the Cu (I) we will need 2 x Cu(1+) to react with S(2-).  Copper (I) Sulphide will be Cu2S.   Using Copper (II) we will need just one of each..Cu(2+) + S(2-) = CuS.|`|KJHw0oI3aa	You are right about copper ions having either a +2 or +1 charge depending on the compound.  Sulfide ions, however, only have -2 charge in binary compounds.    If we are to match up Cu2+ with S2-, we only need one of each, because (+2) + (-2) = 0  The rule is that the sum of all the oxidation numbers (charges) of all the atoms in the formula must add up to zero.  So, in this case the formula fro copper (II) sulfide is CuS.    If we are to match up Cu+ with S2-, we now have more negative than positive charges.  We need one more Cu+ to balance -2 charge on the sulfide ion.  The formula then will contain two Cu+ ions, and one S2- ion.  The formula for copper (I) sulfide will be Cu2S.  Note that the Roman numerals in the names of both compound stand for the positive charge on each copper ion.|`|PzCxpY52aa	i think it should be either Cu2S or Cu2S2 i think the question may be wrong

ToztjpAsaa	CCl4 is a tetrahedral molecule comprising four single bonds, known as sigma bonds, between the carbon atom and the chlorine atoms.  In this type of bonding the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals of the carbon atom are mixed to produce four identical orbitals, a process known as sp3 hybridization.    The CS2 molecule is linear and the carbon atom is bonded to each sulphur by a double bond.  In this type of bonding, the 2s orbital and one 2p orbital of the carbon combine to produce two identical orbitals in a process known as sp hybridization.  The two sp hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds between the carbon and each of the two sulphurs.  The two remaining unused p-orbitals from the carbon are used to form the pi-bonds that make up the other half of each double bond.    I hope that's clear!|`|JLdqz9CZaa	Hybridization =   of bonds +   of lone pairs    Double and triple bonds are considered as ONE bond.    CCl4 has 4 single bonds so the hybridization is sp3  (1 s orbital + 3 p orbitals = 4 sp3 orbitals)    CS2 has 2 double bonds but each one counts as only ONE bond so in reality it is only 2 bonds making the C atom sp hybridized.    (One s orbital + one p orbital= 2 sp orbitals)

z7BiMSWmaa	CAM Plants  These are also C4 plants but instead of segregating the C4 and C3 pathways in different parts of the leaf, they separate them in time instead. (CAM stands for crassulacean acid metabolism because it was first studied in members of the plant family Crassulaceae.)   At night,     CAM plants take in CO2 through their open stomata (they tend to have reduced numbers of them).   The CO2 joins with PEP to form the 4-carbon oxaloacetic acid.   This is converted to 4-carbon malic acid that accumulates during the night in the central vacuole of the cells.  In the morning,   the stomata close (thus conserving moisture as well as reducing the inward diffusion of oxygen).   The accumulated malic acid leaves the vacuole and is broken down to release CO2.   The CO2 is taken up into the Calvin (C3) cycle.      Other C4 plants have structural changes in their leaf anatomy so that   their C4 and C3 pathways are separated in different parts of the leaf with   RUBISCO sequestered where the CO2 level is high; the O2 level low.

The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    Nostradamus didn't predict anything for 2012.    Some people think the Mayans did, but they are wrong. The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012." The Mayan calendar contains events that happen AFTER 2012, even after 4000 AD, so clearly the world will not "end" at this point.    (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    The hoaxters mainly choose 12212012 because of numerology (which is also garbage) and the repeating and reversal of "12", and also because December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY ancient civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.

I0XEVeUxaa	1. Where is option "none of the above"?  The term "analytical balance" is often used to apply to milligram scale balances, and I do not hesitate to consider using a balance in any case of the measuring of a reagent.  As far as liquids, you always TARE (zero the balance with the container on it) before adding them to the container.    2. Another nonsense question.  Define analytical balance!  They all differ according to manufacturer    3. Never heard of it.  Some invented concept of a manufacturer of balances to impress the customer during sales.  All analytical balances have performance standards.  If the "Q-test" is important, it will be stated as a specification, whether or not it is called a "Q test"    4. More nonsense.  They are ALL accurate for a particular application.  Rule;  THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT JOB    5.  (4 * MW of H2O) / (MW of BaI2 * 4 H2O) * 100%  MW of H2O = 18.02 g/mol    6.  (4 * MW of carbon) / (MW of PtCl3(CO2)4 ) * 100%  MW of carbon = 12.011 g/mol    7. M = total mass of 1 mole in grams  percent Ca = x * MW of Ca / M * 100%  percent As = y * MW of As / M * 100%  percent O = z * MW of O / M * 100%  We want to know x, y, and z.  MW of Ca = 40.08, of As = 74.92, of O = 16.0  x = 0.302 * M / 40.08 = 0.007535 * M  y = 0.377 * M / 74.29 = 0.005075 * M  z = 0.321 * M / 16.0 = 0.0200625 * M  x, y, and z must be integer values, so as y is the smallest fraction of M, y = 1 from the start, and you compute x and z relative to it.  Set up proportions such that are all equal to M.  1.  x / 0.007535 = y / 0.005075,  x = y * 0.007535 / 0.005075 = 1.48 y, which is approx. 1.5 y.  This works if y = 2 and x = 3  2.  z / 0.0200625 = y / 0.005075, z = y * 0.0200625 / 0.005075 = 3.95 y , which is approximately equal to 4 * y.  Thus if y = 1, z = 4.  If y = 2, z = 8.    Assume y = 1.  The formula is Ca1.5 As O4  But we don't have half atoms in molecules, so  Ca3 As2 O8 is much more likely.    I suggest you get another chemistry instructor if they have an answer for questions 1, 2, and 4.

AA10164889	Some good answers above.  The solid-state transistor was developed at Bell Labs in 1947.    The space program has brought about many innovations and breakthroughs in electronics, miniaturization, chemistry and chemical engineering, and other branches of applied science.    The use of integrated circuits to miniaturize computers would have been more in the time frame of the Apollo project.  Integrated circuits were used in combat aircraft somewhat before the first shuttle flights.    But the general idea that the cutting edge of modern technology has often been in the space program is certainly correct.|`|qDYzdz5daa	You might be thinking of microchips and integrated circuits, which replaced transistors.

I think it would be hard to make an argument that the space program's need for smaller circuitry was a major influence in their development. The space shuttle, by the way, is a fairly recent development in space travel. At the time semiconductor transistors were being invented, we were still working on modified V-2's.

Sam, BillRussel is correct: The beat frequency f_b occurs at a rate that is the difference between the two combined frequencies f_1 and f_2 ... that is,     f_b = | f_1 - f_2 |     Taking f_b = 3 Hz, and f_1 = 430 Hz, we get:     3 = | 430 - f_2 |    That is,     3 = 430 - f_2    or    3 = f_2 - 430     Therefore,     f_2 = 430 - 3 = 427 Hz, or    f_2 = 430 + 3 = 433 Hz.
qJXdyUY3aa	Eat it. (I'm just teasing ya. ;) )    Well, it depends on the type of amphibian or reptile. In general, most amphibians and reptiles are predators. This means they actively hunt for their prey. Some amphibians and reptiles are venomous. That means they use venom, or poison, to kill their prey or they may simply use venom as a defense mechanism. A snake's venom often helps digest the prey.   Other snakes will wrap around their prey and squeeze it very tightly until their victim can't breathe anymore and as a result dies from suffocation. These kinds of snakes are called constrictors.    There is lots and lots of information about reptiles and amphibians online too, I haven't even scratched the surface in my reply about how they eat. :)   Here's some websites for ya to check out:  About constriction- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrictio...

The Big Bang Theory states that 13.7 (approximately) billion years ago, all of the matter we see in the universe was condensed into a single, infinitesimal, incredibly dense point, called a 'singularity'.     Eventually, this singularity 'exploded' (this isn't accurate, but it's the best term in the English language).     Galaxies give off a particular color depending upon how far away from us they are. Scientists have noticed one thing: these galaxies are spreading out farther. We apply this in reverse, we logically conclude that at one point in time, everything was in this singularity.     There is also "cosmic background radiation" left over from the 'Big Bang' - exactly what the theory predicts. Basically observations suggest that the universe began around 13.7 billion years ago. Since then, the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases. The very early universe, which is still poorly understood, was the split second in which the universe was so hot that particles had energies higher than those currently accessible in particle accelerators on Earth.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	The most prominent scientific theory about the origin of the Earth involves a spinning cloud of dust called a solar nebula. This nebula is a product of the Big Bang. Philosophers, religious scholars and scientists have lots of ideas about where the universe came from, but the most widely-held scientific theory is the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, the universe originated in an enormous explosion.    The Big Bang Model is a broadly accepted theory for the origin and evolution of our universe. It postulates that 12 to 14 billion years ago, the portion of the universe we can see today was only a few millimeters across. It has since expanded from this hot dense state into the vast and much cooler cosmos we currently inhabit. We can see remnants of this hot dense matter as the now very cold cosmic microwave background radiation which still pervades the universe and is visible to microwave detectors as a uniform glow across the entire sky.  map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_theory.h|`|92uZ02Xpaa	The Big Bang theory is the most popular theory.

HkXYGAOdaa	Mean, median, and mode are all actually "average" numbers.  Their use depends on the application one has in mind.    You understand mean.    Now one real life application of median is i.e. computer science in which it is used to figure out the middle index of a sorted array.  For their application, the median as the middle index is the most accurate "average"    A real life use of mode is i.e., medical research.  For example, there is a trial research involving 20 human beings taking an FDA approved drug to test for the symptom rash.  The subjects are checked to see how many developed the rash.  so let's say out of 20 subjects, 18 developed a rash after taking it.  This is where the mode "average" is the most helpful.|`|hkGEy88xaa	median is the middle value of the set of data     ex. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11  median is 5, if the set of data has even set of data then median is the middle value of two middle numbers  ex. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12  median: 5.5    mode is/are number(s) that repeat in a set of data   1 2 3 4  4 6  7 9 9 11 15    mode: 4 and 9|`|6sAOBn4maa	median =  middle number in a set of numbers  mode = the most repeated number in a series of numbers.    3,5,5,4,6    median = 5 (middle number)  mode = 5 (most frequenly repeated number)|`|BkMjabPvaa	the mean is your average    the mode is te number(s) that show up the most    the median is the middle number (and if you have two numbers for the middle one add them together and divide the sum by 2)|`|yhfF21Nfaa	there are 3 types of averaging : mean, median and mode.    Mean means adding up all the numbers, then dividing the sum by the total no of numbers.  Eg: 1, 2, 3  1+2+3=6  6/3=2    Median - take a set of numbers and place them in ascending order.  the one in the middle is the median. if there are 2 nos in the middle, take the mean of the two numbers, and that's the median. there can only be one median.  Eg: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  Median is 3.    Mode: the number which gets repeated teh most. if there are two numbers that repeat the same number of times, then there are two modes. there can be more than one mode.  Eg: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5  The modes are 1 and 4.    Got it now? :)    remember: there can only be one median, one mean, but more than one mode.|`|TsjJscmzaa	Mean is the sum of all the numbers in a series divided by the number of numbers in that set. This is the most commonly used average by far.  Mode is the number used most often in series (if there are no repeated numbers then there is no mode) - I have never in my working life used mode for anything, but would be interested in finding out if it has any practical use!  Median is the middle number in a series when all the numbers are in numerical order - median is used quite often to 'cancel out' exceptionally high or low values (for whatever reason) which would otherwise affect the average.  Example:  series of numbers = 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 9, 27, 37  mean = sum of numbers (99) / number of numbers (9) = 11  mode = 3 (most common)  median = 4 (middle number of the series)|`|S0oRG1sQaa	Media=middle number      example: 2,4,5,6,7= 5 is the median  And! Mode is the most common number. Mean is adding all the numbers and divide it by how many numbers are there for example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So,                                         233345 10 12    There are an even number of results here (8).  So there's no "middle."  At that point, take the two mid ones and take their average: (3+4)/2 = 3.5: that's the median.  The result that appears most is "3."  That's the mode.  Now, the sum of them is 42, and there are 8 of them; so the median is; 42/8 = 5.25.  That's how you do it.

R7BuyyWeaa	Well, it's not quite that simple, because the sweet hearts don't fill the container entirely. There is a good amount of volume in the container that is taken up by air. To find out what percentage of each cubic unit is sweet hearts, you must fill a small container of your own with sweet hearts. First find out, how much volume this container is (We'll call this "V"). You then find out how many sweet hearts fit in this container (we'll call this "N"). Then, you divide the volume of the original larger cylinder by the volume of your smaller container (V) and multiply it by the number of sweet hearts in the smaller container (N).    If you would still like to know the volume of a sweet heart, and you have one on hand, you can drop one into a container of water, and measure how much the water rises, multiplying that by the area of the water's surface.    Other than that, I would guess about Half a cubic centimeter.    -giusti

CCeRdaoLaa	Blood is bright red when it contains oxygen, and it is a dark reddish-maroon when it doesn't contain oxygen.  It is never blue, even when it is inside the body.  The blue color is simply the veins themselves with dark blood within.  They show up as blue because they are under the skin, and blue is the only (visible) wavelength with enough energy to penetrate that deep and reflect back out.    If you still don't believe me, then think back to a time when you may have given blood.  The quick finger-prick blood comes out bright red, since it is from capillaries, so already contains some oxygen and absorbs more on contact with the air.  If you've ever had blood drawn from your arm, though, it comes out very dark red.  In this case, blood is drawn from a vein up into a vacuum tube - a little glass vial without any air inside.  The vacuum pulls the blood up into the tube without coming into contact with oxygen (so it remains its dark, deoxygenated color).  The same is true if you donate blood - the blood bags and tubing contains a little bit of air, but not nearly enough to oxygenate the blood.    There is a little loophole, though (and I mention this because I have a younger brother too).  Some invertebrates, like horseshoe crabs, have hemocyanin (instead of hemoglobin) to transport oxygen around their bodies.  Hemocyanin, like the name implies, has a bluish color (since it uses copper instead of iron to hold onto O2).  Humans and all other vertebrates have red hemoglobin, though.|`|jfxXS7oUaa	Show him veins on your hand. The reason you can see them is because the blood inside it is blue.     http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_a...    This website shows the path of blood traveling through the heart. The blue blood (deoxygenated blood) returns to the heart. Red (oxygen rich) blood is pumped to the body.|`|KN4vGxQaaa	Blood is not blue, at least not vertebrates. The blue that you can see is actually the color of the veins, which does not really depend on the blood. Often times in diagrams red and blue are used as colors to indicate whether the blood traveling though a certain vessel is oxygenated or deoxygenated. So, you could be thinking of that.    One of the main components of human blood is hemoglobin, which contains iron and gives the blood a red color. It is true that the color of blood can vary slightly, but it is always some shade of red.|`|gZpXg91Vaa	no it's not blue. The blue thing you see under your skins are veins.
82a60dc48805ec31cf7fc104867ad3dbaa	i have one idea for you... it might be too simple... but here it is    take two sheets of recyclable paper.      cut a slit half way up both sheets using a razor blade or scissors.      slide the cut ends of each sheet of paper into each other.      stand the paper up vertically.  This is your 3D effect.    secure the middle with tape for stability.    With different colored magic markers (or pencils, water color paints, or whatever you want) draw some organelles on each of the 8 sides of paper. you could hand it in just like that...or...you can have some fun with the recycling part.      for example:     (1)  dye some cooked spaghetti with food coloring for chromatin and glue it on to the paper horizontally (like DNA) using a flour and water paste.  and cut up and clear water bottle and staple it around the spaghetti and call it the nuclear envelope    (2) splatter some red pasta sauce around the paper and call it mitochondria    (3) glue vitamins pills to a few panels and call it them ribisomes    (4) paper punch some newspaper, glue them on in a cluster, and  name them as lysosomes.    (5) glue on plastic bottle caps from water bottles and call them vacuoles    (6) etc, etc    keep in mind the more weight you attach to your 8 sided paper 3-D "cross" the more stability it requires.  but it doesn't have to sit.  you can hand it in with a string attached to the top for a true 3D replica of a cell.        I love this project, and I hope your excitement for it matches mine.      Best to you!

AA6Aq94vaa	Rocks on the sea floor deposited by the mid ocean ridges often contain magnetite. As the magnetite cools and crystallizes, they align with the earth's magnetic poles with the north side of the crystal pointing north and the south side pointing south     The earth's magnetic poles(and magnetic field) are caused by actions within the the earth's liquid core. The liquid outer core moving around the solid inner core acts like an electromagnet which creates both the magnetic poles and magnetic field.     As the mid ocean ridges deposit new sea floor containing magnetite, the earth often switches polarity. The rocks on the sea floor align themselves to the poles at the time they form. So,  the mid ocean ridges create new seafloor, pushing the older seafloor away. And then when the polarity switches the magnetite crystals in new seafloor align themselves in a direction opposite to the ones deposited before the switch. This causes parallel bands of magnetic rock forming on either side of the mid-oceanic ridges.

I live in New England, we get lots of them     but of the ones you mentioned I would say an earthquake because they fracture objects on the earth's surface|`|DRVSCxKpaa	Probably the primary cause is differential settling of the sub-base.  This means that the material underneath the pavement material (concrete or asphalt) has settled at different rates because of slight variation in compaction and composition.  All the other factors (traffic, freezing/thawing, penetration of water, etc, even small earth tremors) increase the risk of differential settling.  A good highway engineer will make sure that the sub-base is well-compacted and stable, to prevent differential settlement.  Sometimes, lime is added to the sub-base to bind it together.  This is called 'lime-stabilised sub-base".|`|SBBnWsJJaa	How about spring thaw?    The soil upon which the highway is built thaws out and the soft wet soil beneath it can't support the weight of the cars on the highway.  Cracks and potholes result.

6e4e00a996a0ffeff0cf000863c8c42baa	Mr Ball contributes 8/35 of the money (because 32,000/140,000 = 8/35)  Mr Keats contributes 12/25 of the money (48,000/140,000 = 12/25)  Mr Hunt contributes the rest, which is 140,000 - 32,000 - 48,000 = 60,000, and this is 15/35 of the money (60,000/140,000 = 15/35).    It's only fair that they should get the same proportion of the profit as they put in (i.e. if you put more money in, you should get more of the profit). One thirty-fifth of the profit is 1/35 x 52,500 = 1500.     Mr Ball gets 8/35, which is 8x1500 = 12,000  Mr Keats gets 12/35, which is 12x1500 = 18,000  Mr Hunt gets 15/35, which is 15x1500 = 22,500    and we see that the totals of these comes to 52,500, as we might expect.|`|j29Vh5Ajaa	You can solve this by setting up a percentage of each ones contributions.  Mr. Ball = 32000/ 140000 * profit =12000  Mr. Keats = 48000 / 140000 * profit = 18000  Mr. Hunt = 60000/ 140000 * profit = 22500|`|rPrcUlgTaa	The question wants you to figure out what percentage of the capital everyone donated, and then divide up the profits using the same percentages.    Mr Ball gave 32000 out of 140000  His percentage is 32000/140000 = 22.9%  22.9% of 52500 = .229 * 52500 = $12022.50    Mr Keats gave 48000 out of 140000  His percentage is 48000/140000 = 34.3%  34.3% of 52500 = .343 * 52500 = 18007.50    Mr Hunt gave the rest.  His percentage is (140000-32000-48000)/140000 =   60000/140000 = 42.8%  42.8% of 52500 = .428 * 52500 = $22470.00      Hope that all makes sense

How much has it been damaged? What type of damage? What type of ecosystem?     Have you ever heard of succession? The gradual and orderly process of ecosystem development brought about by changes in community composition and the production of a climax characteristic of a particular geographic region.    The key word here is gradual. So, usually, succession takes place over many years. It's really actually amazing and beautiful when you think of the determination of life (plants and nature). If you have a concrete parking lot that is abandoned for years (no cars parking there or human acitivity), eventually weeds  and plant life will rise from cracks in the cement. If left alone, that parking lot will eventually go through stages of succession that will result in it going back to its natural state (evolutionary changes are  always possible).    So, after my thesis, my best answer is : Many years.    I hope this helps.    Good Luck!

QoVE2erFaa	First solve det(A-I)=0  Here A-I is the matrix with row1=[4-  1 ], row2=[-2  1-], and the det of this =  ^2 -5 +6. Setting this equal to 0 yields  = 2 and 3.  So the eigenvalues are 2 and 3.  {at this point I like to check these- before doing the work for the eigenvectors- by verifying that the sum of the eigenvalues = the trace of A, and the product of the eigenvalues = the det of A [it is a Thm that this must be true]. They do. }    Now to get the eigenvectors:  Solve (A-I)v = 0   where v= {written as a column vector} for each of the eigenvalues ( v will be the eigenvector):    For =2, A-I is: row1=[2 1], row2=[-2 -1]. So (A-I)v=0 gives the equations 2x+y=0  and -2x-y=0. The solution is x = -y/2 where y is a free parameter, so v =  = y {again written as a column vector}. So the eigenvector for =2 is  .  The eigenspace for the eigenvalue 2 is the span of the eigenvectors for =2 which here is simply  span{  }. So the eigenspace for =2 has Dim = 1.    For =3, (A-I)v = 0 gives the system x+y=0  and -2x-2y=0. The solution is x = -y, so v =  = y . So the eigenvector for =3 is . The eigenspace for the eigenvalue 3 is the span of   , so it has Dim=1.     As a check, it's a good idea to see if our answers satisfy Av=v:  For =2, v=,  Av=  which does = 2.  For =3, v=, Av= which does= 3.  {again, all vectors would be written as columns}.    This is a very straight-forward eigenvalue problem so you should learn the method well.    Let me know if you need more details,
JLdqz9CZaa	There are 4 quantum numbers associated with an electron. The four number are as follows: n, l, m, and Ms    n is the principal energy level    l is the shape of orbital for the electron    m is the direction of the orbital    There is a way to find what the possible numbers for l and m are for any energy level.     n can be 1,2,3,4.....etc....til infinity    l can be from 0 up to the value of (n-1)    m can be from -L .....0.....+L    Example.    n= 3    The possible values for l are 0,1,2 (from 0 up to (n-1) )    The possible values for l depend on the value of l    for l =0  m=0  for l=1  m= -1 0 +1  for l=2 m= -2, -1, 0, 1, 2    When they ask for the for the associated orbitals they are asking what orbitals exist for n=4. If you follow my example above for n=3, the possible values for l=0,1,or 2    When L=0 this is an S orbital  When L=1 this is a   P orbital  When L=2 this is a   D orbital    So for n=3 the associated orbitals are 3s,3p,and 3d|`|KJHw0oI3aa	The fourth principal energy level (n = 4) may contain up to four sub-shells:  4s, 4p, 4d, and 4f  Any "s" sub-shell has only one orbital.  Any "p" sub-shell has three orbitals.  Any "d" sub-shell has five orbitals.  Any "f" sub-shell has seven orbitals.  Potentially, the fourth energy level may have a total of 16 orbitals.  I said, "potentially" because it depends on the total number of electrons an atom has.  If it does not have electrons to fill up all the sub-shells in the principal energy level 4, then those orbitals do not exist.

z7BiMSWmaa	The cell cycle is divided into two main parts: interphase and mitosis (see illustration IN LINK). During interphase, the cell grows and replicates its chromosomes. Interphase accounts for all but an hour or two of a 24-h cell cycle, and is subdivided into three phases: gap phase 1 (G1), synthesis (S), and gap phase 2 (G2). Interphase is followed by mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cell division). This relatively brief part of the cell cycle includes some of the most dramatic events in cell biology.    G1 phase    Gap phase 1 begins at the completion of mitosis and cytokinesis and lasts until the beginning of S phase. This phase is generally the longest of the four cell cycle phases and is quite variable in length. During this phase, the cell chooses either to replicate its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or to exit the cell cycle and enter a quiescent state (the G0 phase).      S phase    Replication of the chromosomes is restricted to one specific portion of interphase, called S phase (DNA synthesis phase), which typically lasts about 6 h. In mammalian cells, the start of S phasethe actual initiation of DNA synthesistakes place several hours after the cell has committed to carrying out DNA synthesis. During S phase, each chromosome replicates exactly once to form a pair of physically linked sister chromatids. In animal cells, a pair of centrioles is also duplicated during S phase.       G2 phase    The portion of interphase that follows S phase is called gap phase 2. Some cells can exit the cell cycle from G2 phase, just as they can from G1 phase.      M phase    M phase includes the overlapping processes of mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis is divided into five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cytokinesis usually begins during anaphase and ends at a point after the completion of mitosis. At the end of cytokinesis, the parent cell has formed its two G1 phase progeny and the cell is ready to repeat the cycle.

That function could be in the structuring/packaging of DNA (association with proteins to form chromatin).  It could be in involved with the replication of DNA.  And most importantly, these patterns may be involved in the expression of DNA...its control and the parts that code for proteins or RNA (genes).    Note that bioinformatics is the science (typically computational) in which patterns having biological significance are sought.   This science applies to both DNA and protein.

I0XEVeUxaa	Flatworms (Platyhelminthes) show the what is believed to be evolutionary advance of bilateral rather than radial symmetry, so we can eliminate option D.    They have not evolved a coelom yet (acoelmate), which is a tissue lining serving as a container in which organs making up systems can be stored generally.  So B cannot be true.    Digestive systems digest...they are not involved with circulatory or respiratory systems, which are involved with making sure cells get oxygen gas in particular.    So that means that the organism must have a body geometry that does not have any tissue layers that prevents oxygen diffiusion or limit it.    This would true of option A...its body geometry (surface area-to-volume) must be such that oxygen transport is not a problem if it happens by simple diffusion, rather than through a system that enables oxygen delivery to deeply embedded cells in internal tissue layers.

AA10112320	In general, frogs (Anurans) are adapted for jumping locomotion.   If you compare the skeleton of a frog with that of a salamander, you'll see that in the frog the hindlimbs are much longer than the forelimbs, they have a short vertebral column and no tail (the tail vertebrae are fused as a bony rod, the urostyle).   They also have a specialized communication system by means of sounds; the males have vocal sacs that they use to produce their calls, and both sexes have a very well developed sense of hearing.    That is in general. In particular, frogs are a very diverse group: there are climbing species that live in trees and have special pads in their fingertips that adhere to the surfaces; there are aquatic species with full interdigital membranes; there are terrestrial species adapted to dry climates that have a thick warty skin.   There are also a lot of adaptations related to their breeding methods, from those that release their eggs in the water to those that build foam nests, burrows, or carry their eggs and tadpoles on their backs, or in the stomach, or on special pouches... the diversity is amazing!

Most frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding eyes and the absence of a tail. Most frogs have a semi-aquatic lifestyle, but move easily on land by jumping or climbing. They typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds or lakes, and their larvae, called tadpoles, have gills and develop in water. Adult frogs follow a carnivorous diet, mostly of arthropods, annelids and gastropods. Frogs are most noticeable by their call, which can be widely heard during the night or day, mainly in their mating season.    The distribution of frogs ranges from tropic to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforest's.

In human DNA, for example, the four bases are present in these percentages: A=30.9% and T=29.4%; G=19.9% and C=19.8%. This strongly hinted towards the base pair makeup of the DNA, although Chargaff was not able to make this connection himself. For this research, Chargaff is credited with disproving the tetranucleotide hypothesis (Phoebus Levene's widely accepted hypothesis that DNA was composed of a large number of repeats of GACT). Most workers had previously assumed that deviations from equimolar base ratios (G = A = C = T) were due to experimental error, but Chargaff documented that the variation was real, with [C + G] typically being slightly less abundant. He was able to do this with the newly developed paper chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Chargaff met Francis Crick and James D. Watson at Cambridge in 1952, and, despite not getting on well with them personally, explained his findings to them. Chargaff's research would later help Watson and Crick to deduce the double helical structure of DNA.    The second of Chargaff's rules is that the composition of DNA varies from one species to another, in particular in the relative amounts of A, G, T, and C bases. Such evidence of molecular diversity, which had been presumed absent from DNA, made DNA a more credible candidate for the genetic material than protein.    Besides making these important steps toward the structure of DNA, Chargaff's lab also conducted research on the metabolism of amino acids and inositol, blood coagulation, lipids and lipoproteins, and the biosynthesis of phosphotransferases.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Chargaff contributed a rule, called Chargaff's rule, & the rule states that the nitrogen bases A=T, & C=G in DNA.  A-adenine  T-thymine  C-cytosine  G-guanine|`|qXpxILnRaa	state that DNA from any cell of all organisms should have a 1:1 ratio of pyrimidine and purine bases and, more specifically, that the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine.    Basically that %A=%T AND %C=%G|`|AA12272885	Basically Chargaff's Rules state that the number of purines and pyrimidines in a DNA strand are equal, there will be an equal percentage of adenine and thymine, and cytosine will equal the quanine.

Sugar unit in RNA's monomer is ribose which contain (-OH) group attached to C2; DNA's nucleotide contains deoxyribose (-H) group    3. Nitrogenous bases of RNA are Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Uracil; Nitrogenous bases of DNA are Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine    4. RNA are found in nucleus and cytoplasm of cell; DNA are mostly confined to chromosomes in nucleus and to mitochondria and chloroplasts (in small amounts)    5. There are 3 types of RNA : mRNA, rRNA, tRNA ; DNA have only one type    6. RNA are very short molecules; DNA are longer and bigger molecules    7.

For instance, you could write about the reactivity of the alkalines, alkaline earth metals, and halogens, inert properties of Noble gasses, etc.     As far as a game goes you could create a "Go fish" type game with cards as elements and have them form simple polyatomics or simple compounds    You could also make a periodic table bingo and give hints based on their group, period, or properties.     They sound a bit corny to me, but something is better than nothing.

iyyvbHHnaa	Seems deceptively easy. But remember to keep leap years in mind.  Every 4th year is a leap year. (I may be wrong, so make sure you check this out and make your own adjustments)  Therefore you will have 25 leap years in this case, with 367 days.    Regular years = 75 years  75 years * 365 = 27375 days  27375 * 24 = 657000 hours  657000 * 60 = 39420000 minutes  39420000 = 2365200000 seconds in regular years    Leap years = 25 years  25 * 366 = 9150 days  9150 * 24 = 219600 hours  220200 * 60 = 13176000 minutes  13212000 * 60 = 790560000 seconds in leap years.    Add them both up    3155760000 seconds in a century.  (Thanks Flossy for the correction!)    Note: You know what...to be honest, this depends when this "century" starts. It can include one more or one less leap year depending on when you start counting the years. This question is stupid and so is your teacher. But as long as you show that you've made your adjustment (which your teacher probably will look for) you should get 50 points.    Flossy: You're right. I made a stupid mistake.

b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	In Australia, many zoos have volunteers helping out there. A lot are high school students.  I think many of those volunteers would have a hard time getting permission from mummy if prisoners were working along side them.    Also, care for animals includes knowledge and heartistic concern. Forcing someone to do the care work may miss some early signs the animals need for greater care.    a GOOD thing about your idea, ...  If prisoners are going through study courses to help themselves succeed once they get out, then any prisoner studying things related to zoo animals could qualify to help at zoos .... a bit of work experience|`|eiim3tJuaa	No, the prisoners don't have the knowledge or experience to care for the zoo animals. Either the prisoner or animal would get hurt costing the zoo money.      Entry Level Keepers need to have a degree and experience to even have a chance to become a keeper.  http://www.aazk.org/zkcareer/keeper_jobs...  ...Years ago, zoo keepers weren't required to have any specialized training-they basically needed to be physically strong enough to carry out the manual labor associated with the job. Their basic duties were to feed and clean up after the animals. Period. That is not the case today when zoo keepers are called upon to be skilled record keepers, keen observers of animal behavior, creative mechanics with tools and exhibit construction, and public educators to the millions of visitors who visit the nation's zoos each year. Knowledge of both operant conditioning and enrichment is now a basic requirement. Todays keeper must also understand the role of conservation in the zoo field...    http://www.aazk.org/zkcareer/training.ph...  Today's zookeeper is an educated person. Gone are the days when all you needed was a love for animals, a shovel and a strong back. Now we are expected to know animal husbandry, nutrition, operant conditioning, enrichment and conservation; we are also expected to be able to lift 50 lbs., and to work weekends and holidays. We do this job because we love it, not for the money...    http://www.aza.org/ForEveryone/Careers/  Requirements    The conservation and scientific programs in zoos and aquariums have become highly technical and specialized. Although practical experience with animals may sometimes be substituted for academic training, most entry-level keeper positions now require a four-year college degree.

KRTPJP2baa	Assume one of the trains is stopped and the other is moving at 94mph  Time to cover 658 miles is 658/94 = 7 hours    In 7 hours  freight train covers 41 x 7 = 287 miles  In 7 hours passenger train covers 53 x 7 = 371 miles    So trains meet after 7 hours at 287 miles from freight train start end or 371 miles from passenger train start end.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	That is a badly worded question. If the trains have PASSED each other, the length of each train would need to be known. I will assume there was sufficient rail for the front of each to be truly travelling the 658 miles.  Neglecting that technicality, the average speed of both trains is 47 MPH. Double it = 94 MPH, the closing speed (there's 2 trains). Same result as adding both speeds.  The distance is 658 miles. Divide by the 94.   I make that 7 hrs.   The lead carriages or engines would just be on the line between the foremost point of each, square to their directions of travel. They can't MEET.

QePbhS8Caa	Since I believe the world as we know it is likely to end in 2012, I don't worry much about it. Those few who survive will have to rebuild and the level of technology will likely take a long while to come back to what it was. Also, given my health, I probably wouldn't live to see 2045 anyway.    I think it that it's a possibility, but I don't think it will happen as quickly as  that. The government hasn't even convinced us to get chipped yet. As for robots tossing us off buildings, why does everyone assume our robots will want to kill us so soon? I think they will try to co-exist with us first.

cU2s9Ndyaa	Graham's Law:   r1/r2 = (M2/M1)^1/2 where r1 and r2 are the ratios of diffusion and M is the molar mass the gas.  so..  r=[16(2)+12/1(2)]^1/2 is the ratio of diffusion of Hydrgoen to Carbon Dioxide. It's a large number because the rates of diffusion depend only on the molar mass of the gasses, and of course CO2 is far more massive than H2.    2)  answer from part 1 = r1/r2. Make r2 = 32 seconds and solve for r1.
SvmZlLdaaa	In the majority of species, it isn't. Except in a few creatures in which inbreeding is the normal method of reproduction, most animals can suffer as a result of inbreeding. The reason is that anything detrimental in the family is twice as likely to be passed on to offspring if the parents are related. First-generation inbreds, for example the offspring of a father and daughter, are not usually deformed (though it is possible), but if you continue to inbreed generation after generation you will soon end up with deformed animals. However, the most common result of inbreeding is a compromised immune system. One of the main reasons for animals to reproduce sexually is that mixing of the genes results in more variation in the population - that way, if there is a sudden outbreak of disease, it's likely some individuals will be resistant to it. An inbred animal is often more susceptible to certain diseases than a non-inbred one would be. This is especially likely in the case of the offspring of a brother and sister, since siblings share more genetic material with each other than with either of their parents (meaning that the offspring of siblings has very little genetic variation).    Whilst there may be some degree of inbreeding in wild populations, in the vast majority of species the social system is organised to minimise this because of its detrimental effects. One has only to look at the myriad disorders seen in various breeds of pedigree dogs to see the negative results of years of inbreeding.|`|a341c10e4b45d0b72a48cbb360934201aa	Actually, it's not after a while.  That's why purebred dogs have more problems such as hip dysplasia.  They are often inbred, which does cause problems on down the line.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Animals do not have social morals and ethics.|`|Sw0u2RD7aa	Animals usually dont interbreed unless there is a very small population or humans make them (dogs or horses).  Animals are able to recognize their relatives to minimize inbreeding.  And yes with a lot of inbreeding animals can show developmental effects much like people.|`|273f4d8a2a7dc06d2adecfcbd9d31ba8aa	Inbreeding is not good because of all the diseases and threats is poses.  Humans have had the technology to recognize this problem, whereas other animals have not.  The same risks are posed when animals inbreed, but nature normally makes it so this doesn't happen.  This is why purebred dogs have so many more health problems than mutts, they are mainly inbred by man.|`|zsDqTZDHaa	because when people inbreed they end up with mentally challanged( "retarted", autistic, down syndromic......) and animals only act retarted they cant really be retarted at least i dont think so.|`|CJigVHLIaa	It's really not Okay and doesn't occur that much in nature, but more frequently in dog/cat/horse ownership.

fmr98EBtaa	Just thinking about it, you would need to figure out how much CO2 would be produced by humans over a period of time, preferably expressed as a rate. You would then need to determine the rate at which certain plants consumed CO2, and so long as this rate is greater than the rate of human CO2 exhalation then you should be good to go. However, the rate at which plants take in CO2 is probably not constant and can change based on varying conditions and from plant to plant.|`|MLN2tJuyaa	The thing that comes to my mind is Biosphere 2 (Biosphere 1 being the Earth) which was constructed in Arizona in the late 1980s.

KuPjzXzYaa	it just depends what experiment you get, i doubt they'll ask you how to improve on a titration, after all it is pretty accurate, as the calibration on the instruments you use have small percentage errors, apart from that it just depends on the questions you get.    usually they ask you about problems with a student who used gas collection as a method of measuring something, just have to ask yourself:  was the measuring device used that accurately calibrated? if not provide a suggestion as to a better device, if so, then state why this device is better, do percentage error calculations e.t.c to show what the error of measurement might be  also was the experiment repeated? and averages calculated to get rid of anomalous results? if not then this is a suggestion that you could put in to increase the accuracy of the students experiment.    there are also other things you can include but those are just 2 that seem to be relevant with most papers that ask you to carry out a titration in my experience.    then again i could be totally wrong... whose 100% sure about anything? pigs may actually be able to fly, in a gravity-less area of our universe?|`|ToztjpAsaa	Do you have teachers at your school?

Sorry I couldn't really be much help, if you're really worried speak to your teacher before the exam. They'll probably be able to help you more than anyone on here :)  x|`|CZwFNUoOaa	I did a similar experiment last yr for my AS but I am doing AQA chemistry but am sure its not much different. First dont worry about the experiment its not that hard just make sure you read the instruction thoroughly before you start and go slowly (I hate experiment as well they never seem to work when I do them lol)  -recognising trends is easy draw a graph a state what it shows i.e. the is a strong positive correlation ( as one increases so does the other) this make sit easy to spot anomalies if you draw a line of best fit any points which arent as close to the line as the others are anomalous  - to reach a valid conclusion you need to explain that although your experiment had weaknesses you still think it is reliable as the results follow a trend, you did repeats to make sure the results were accurate and the results were  similar to how you expected them to be  - To assess the reliability explain how you kept the independent variables the same, used the same equipment etc (any  thing you did to make the experiment fair). Then explain some of the weaknesses of the experiment (but make sure you explain it was the inaccuracy of the equipment not you doing things wrong or you will lose marks) you might have to work out % errors of equipment so you can comment on these  -to explain improvements just think of ways you can make the experiment more accurate (remember you dont have to do the experiment so you can suggest any equipment you think would be better even if you dont have access to it) as long as you can justify how it will make your experiment more accurate you can make any suggestions    Also make sure you know all your calculation as i got asked to do calculations on mine so you might be asked also.

If you're accounting for friction (as a result of gravity), you have to exert a force equal to the resisting force of friction to make the net force of the entire system be 0. When the net force is 0, there is no acceleration or deceleration.     To make a car accelerate or decelerate, you apply a force.

kTNz1VJuaa	There are painting techniques that are "electro-static" where the paint gun imparts a positive charge to the paint and the thing being painted is given a negative charge so the paint is attracted to the part.  Most notably, powder coating is done this way.    In powder coating, there is no liquid to carry the pigment; it is dry powder. After the parts are painted they are baked to adhere the paint and you can sweep up any leftover pigment powder & reuse it.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	That's a good answer from redscott 77092.  The static charge means the paint, when sprayed, is actually attracted to the opposite charged workpiece.  Unlike standard spraypainting, the "overspray" (paint being blown past the workpiece into the atmosphere) will curve around and be deposited upon the job.   Little overspray is thus produced, more paint ends up where it was meant to go. As a bonus, you can "paint around corners".

Just before you compute uv - v dx you had two minus signs but when you wrote that part out you still had a minus sign instead of having the multiple of two minus signs become a plus signs.  --------------------------    Integration by parts     u dv = uv -  v du    Let u = ln(x)  Then du = (1/x) dx    Let dv = (x^(-9)) dx  Then v = (-(x^(-8)) / 8)    uv = - [(ln(x) * ((x^(-8)) / 8)]     v du = -  ((x^(-9)) / 8) dx    So  [ln(x) * (x^(-9))] dx =    - [(ln(x) * ((x^(-8)) / 8)] +  ((x^(-9)) / 8) dx = ** + not - ..there are two minuses**     ((x^(-9)) / 8) dx = (x^(-8)) / 64 + C    and     - [(ln(x) * ((x^(-8)) / 8)] = [(-8) * (ln(x) * (x^(-8)] / 64    So you finally get:    [- (8*ln(x) + 1) / (64x^8)] + C.....  ------------------

I suspect you are screwing up defining base and height (which, I do admit, can be awkward at times).    Use Heron's formula...much easier this way.    Area = SquareRoot[(perimeter/2)(perimeter/2-a)(...    For example, if you've got some retarded triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5.    Perimeter = 3+4+5 = 12  Perimeter/2 = 6  Area = Sqrt[(6)(6-5)(6-4)(6-3)]  = 6    This way, you will not be confused with which side is the height and which side is the base.    If you need further help, google Heron's Formula..|`|iJ6QRWnGaa	Yes it is.    for example, say the three sides are 4,8,and 10.    Say it's a right triangle, so the base is 4 and the height is 8.    4x8=32. 32/2= 16. So the area is 16    say you move it so the base is 8 and the height is 4. Since 4x8 still equals 32, the area will still be 16    I'm not sure what you are doing wrong, but make sure that if it is not a right triangle, you are considering one of the sides to be the same as the height.|`|xKVMbHoKaa	yea. its still the same triangle so its gonna have the same area.|`|yhfF21Nfaa	yes, no matter what you do, as long as you don't do anything to the original shape of the triangle, the area will always remain the same :)|`|UYTVuv2vaa	Yes, as long as you are translating/rotating/reflecting it then the area is the same.

b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	I'm assuming that this formula is actually C4H4Cl2. The subscript behind each chemical element symbol tells you how many atoms of that element are in each molecule of the compound. In this case, the formula tells you that each molecule contains four C atoms, four H atoms, and two Cl atoms.  To calculate the molecular weight, multiply the number of each kind of atom by its atomic weight and add them all together. For this compound  4 X at wt of C = 4 X 12 = 48  4 X at wt of H = 4 X 1 = 4  2 X at wt of Cl = 2 X 35.5 = 71  therefore mol wt = 48 + 4 + 71 = 123 g/mol    Does that answer your question?|`|5mhSeHFDaa	Go to your periodic table and look for the molar masses of Carbon and Hydrogen.  multiply carbon by 16 and hydrogen by 4 and add those numbers together.

v3I7288kaa	The sun is huge. It is always supplying constant energy.  The sun is considered a renewable resource because it lasts a very long time. In astronomy, the sun will eventually die out but not for many billions of years. This is a long time so we consider it renewable because it won't run out any time soon unlike coal, oil, gas, etc.|`|07YBD5mJaa	This is a very good question for discussion.    What do we mean by "natural resources"?  The term natural resources has undergone changes in meaning over time.  In the past, natural resources (the term) were considered to be sources of useful commodities (physical substances, such as food, grains, and metals; products; goods for sale; articles of commerce - such as trees, fish, oil, natural gas, and coal).  In a limited  sense, the term natural resources is still used in this way.  More recently, however, the concept of natural resources has been expanded to include the total natural environment  - the entire surface layer of the planet (including whole ecosystems).  Human activities can have an affect on these natural resources.    So, utilizing the definitions above, we would not be considering the Sun as a natural resource, even though it is a resource supplied by nature.  Or should we?  Solar energy from the Sun can be collected, bought and sold as a commodity, and it can be collected on the surface layer of the planet.  But, solar energy is a product of the reactions within the Sun.  It is not the Sun.  The Sun is made up of gases, and it is the source of our light and heat.  Solar energy comes from thermonuclear reactions within the center of the Sun, and a portion of that energy comes to Earth in the form of sunlight which heats the earth.  We have no control over the Sun.   We cannot buy it, sell it or exploit it.  The Sun is not a commodity.  The Sun, itself, is not a resource that we can manage - or mismanage (fortunately).  We can manage or mismanage our forests, our fresh water sources, our fish stocks, our ecosystems.  We can manage or mismanage our non-renewables, such as fossil fuels and minerals.    The sun is 4.5 billion years old.  Astronomers believe that the Sun will be a continuing source of energy for Earth at least another 5 billion years.  If we continue in the current rate of global population increase and continue in the exploitation, mismanagement and pollution of our natural resources which we have control over, we (the human species) may not even be around to watch the sun become a|`|xKVMbHoKaa	because u cant use it all up. u can use up oil and stuff.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	Because it will not run out like oil will. well atleast it won't for a few billion years|`|AA11136356	It's never used up.

233uajnQaa	You could break it down to two, but you will not use the Horizontal side. So, you just worry about the vertical equation.   On the Vertical side you have this equation:   Yf (Force in the Y-Axis)= Yo + Voy (Initial Velocity in the Y axis)*t (time) + 1/2 g(Gravity)* t^2.   On the Horizontal Side,we have= Xf= Vox( Initital Velocity in X-Axis)(time)  Now we must break down the velocity into the components.  For the vertical component: it is 20 Sin (30 degrees)= 10.00 m/s  For Horizontal component: it is 20 Cos (30 degrees)= 17.32 m/s    The second question is asking for t, time. So lets start with the vertical equation above.  Yf= Yo + Voy(t) + 1/2 g(t squared)   Yf is 0 since you started on the ground.  So, 0= [initial velocity in the Y is 10] (t--we don't know it)+ 1/2 (-9.8) (t squared)   0=10t + -4.9t^2  Subtract 10t from both sides.   -10t=-4.9t^2; You have a T on both sides so you can just cross one out from both sides. Meaning that the T with the -10 is gone and the T squared becomes JUST t.   So, -10=-4.9t; divide both sides by -4.9; and T= 2.0408 seconds.    C) The Maximum Height...you can think about it like a PATH "half a U" it takes it half the time to reach the maximum height. [draw a picture, half the U is the highest the path is at. So plug half the time (1.02 seconds) into the equation.  Yf= 0 + 10(1.02) + 1/2 (-9.8) (1.02)^2  Yf= 5.102    This is LONG, and Boring, but I hope it helps....
FT4mVJMzaa	No, the Roche Limit is the limit inside of which tidal forces are too great for self-accretion to occur. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the rotation rate of the planet, which geosynchronous orbit obviously does.|`|jcGeCJnOaa	Not in respect to the Earth. The Roche limit is the generally two and a half times to diameter of a planet. That is the distance at which a large object (ie. a moon) would break up due to tidal forces.     For the Earth the Roche limit would be approximately 31,890 km. Geosynchronous orbit for the Earth is 35784 km. Of course these are lots of objects orbiting the Earth at lower orbits than this. They do not break apart because they are not massive enough for tidal forces to affect them.    If the Earth rotated slower, or if the Earth were more massive, geosynchronous orbit could coincide with the Roche limit. But neither of those conditions apply to us.|`|h0d5pTUtaa	I dont think so the roche limit which occurs due to excessive gravitational pull and the geosynchronous orbit has to do with the time period of rotation of an orbit..and the time period of the satellite is due to the gravity of earth not so strong to break of the satellite which is some 100ds of km away........ but it just pulls the satellite towards itself..

l2BjWA5Baa	First, let's review an important principle of exponents.  If you're multiplying numbers with the same base, then you simply add the powers.  Therefore, we can simplify (5^(4/3)) * (5^x) to 5^(4/3 + x).    Now let me teach you a trick - if all the terms OF A POLYNOMIAL (that means only adding and subtracting) have the same base, you can simply knock out the bases and play with the exponents.  In order to do this, though, you need to rewrite 25 as a power of 5 so that all of your terms have a base of 5.  Hopefully you already know that 25 = 5^2, so rewrite this way:    5^(4/3 + x) = 5^2.        4/3 + x = 2         Subtract 4/3 from both sides (email me if you need to review subtracting fractions) to get x = 2/3, the correct answer!     The only other things you'll need to know to tackle the second problem are these:  When you raise a power to a power, you multiply them (so (2^4)^4 = 2^16, etc).  Finally, when you divide powers with the same base, you subtract the bottom from the top (so (2^3)/(2^x) = 2^(3-x), and so on).    Give it a shot! And email me if you want to check your answer or need further help. Best of luck!|`|nvdbSV5Uaa	(5^(4/3)) * (5^x) = 25    (5^(4/3)) * (5^x) = 5^2    5^(4/3 + x) = 5^2    so   4/3 + x = 2    solving for x = (2/3)      ((2^2)^(1/3)) * ((2^(1/2))^(5/2)) = ((2^((7/3)/(2^x))    ((2^(2/3))) * ((2^(5/4))) = (2^(7/3 - x))    (2^(2/3 + 5/4)) = (2^(7/3 - x))    so (2/3 + 5/4) = (7/3 - x)    8/12 + 15/12 = 28/12 - x    23/12 = 28/12 - x    x = (5/12)      Regards
l2BjWA5Baa	I'll admit, I'm not entirely sure what kind of help you are looking for.  If you need help with specific math problems, post questions and you'll get answers.    If you just want some encouragement, then I'll give you some. Don't worry about it! Pursue what you love. If that's English, then it doesn't matter what garbage other people give you.  If you're worried about feeling stupid for taking pre-alg again, take a deep breath and don't worry about it. Obviously if the class exists, you're not the only one who needs a refresher! It's easy to forget things over the course of a year.  If you are really worried about lagging behind, join a study group/get a tutor/take classes over the summer - since you've already taken these math classes, it may be easy for you to move along pretty quickly once you get back into the pattern of thinking like a mathematician.  English and math are totally different ways of thinking.    Finally, everyone has different gifts. If math isn't yours, don't sweat it! There are no doubt math majors who wish that they could read more than four words per minute or write a coherent sentence. Maybe you could find a math major buddy and swap tutoring sessions!    Best of luck to you, and feel free to email me any time you need help with math homework.|`|hkGEy88xaa	well, some people are good in one thing some other people are good in another, you shouldn't feel that bad because you did the test terrible, probably you can write better essays than some mathematicians ))  so...cheer up, do your class good, maybe by the end of semester you can take the test again and place a bit higher (I don't know how much math you need for english major though, but look forward to have a probably just college algebra more and get done with that "horrible" math for life)   good luck ))|`|4Vchxp32aa	algebra is rather easy.

YrpgsBhqaa	No. This would produce an observable change in the moment of inertia of earth over time, which has not been observed.    Furthermore, the tenants imply that new mass has been created through some sort of electron-positron pairing process, which seems like something obscure enough to the majority of the public to be deemed possible, but in reality, this goes against the first law of thermodynamics (no energy or matter can be spontaneously created). Electron-positron collisions result in 2 gamma rays, which would likely escape the core of the earth eventually, causing the earth to actually *lose* mass over time.    Edit: Upon further inspection, the theory could be possible, because http://www.expanding-earth.org/ states that earth has gained mass through accretion of meteorites and gravitationally-fueled heat reactions in the core of the earth. These theories do not account for any loss of mass though, which could occur through a number of processes. Because of this, I'm deeming the theory implausible unless it comes up with exact numbers for the accretion of meteorites, the energy gained from gravity, the energy absorbed from the sun, and the amount of heat and other energy/mass that is lost from the earth every day.    Also, it isn't a theory; a theory implies wide acceptance by scientists world-wide, and convincing empirical data that is not matched by anything else. The 'theory' should be renamed: The Expanding Earth Hypothesis.

Remember Y2K? Doomsday people were saying planes would fall out of the sky. People said a planetary alignment would cause earthquakes. ALL kinds of BAD things were supposed to happen... AND NONE OF THEM CAME TRUE.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	The whole thing began as astrologers noticed that a point called the winter solstice was crossing the Milky Way (and the Galactic equator).    Astrologers being those who believe that the sky runs our lives, decided that this "event" must mean something special. In a way, this is strange as astrologers have generally ignored the Galactic equator (being a recent invention, it was not part of the "classical" astrology).    So they made "New Age"-type predictions (a new chance for humanity, more peace, brotherly love among the nations, etc.).    Still, not much was made of it, because a lot of our Western Civilization "New Age" stuff is normally based on the Spring Equinox moving through the constellations (e.g., we are moving from the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius).    We (western civilization) had no reason to pay attention to the Winter Solstice.  Until...    ---    Later, someone found that the Mayans had a day-count calendar that reaches a round figure on a date somewhat in the general area of the "event" (even though the "event", described above, does not happen in 2012).    And this date, in the Mayan calendar, had a direct link with the Winter Solstice. On the day we call 2012.12.21, the Mayan calendar reaches the round figure 13.00.00.00.00 in their counting system.    This is not surprising, since the day of Winter solstice was, every year, New Year's Day for the Mayans. If you are setting up a calendar with an important round figure, you fix it so that it falls on New Year's Day. Big celebration. Lots of cake.    "Well", someone thought "this must be an important date that is linked with the event we described earlier". Because of the link to the Winter Solstice. This is where Jos A. came in to the act.    So the New Age predictions started again. Except, this time, some hoaxers got into it and decided to crank up the scare factor. (Some people just love to scare others, just for the fun of it)    This is when began the lies about the Mayan calendar "ending" (it does not) or the Mayans having predicted the end-of-the-world (they did not).    From that point on, there seemed to be a contest, which I have called the Big 2012 Hoax Off, as to who could come up with the biggest boldfaced lie and still get people to believe it.    All this had begun quite some time ago but we did not hear about it until the year 2000 had passed (Y2k -- the Year 2000 end-of-civilization -- had distracted us from these other lies).    ---    Meanwhile, another group had predicted the end-of-the-world for the year 2003. You see, there was to be this Planet X coming close to us, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, even pole flips.  "Nancy L." had been told all this by some aliens from a planet around Zeta Reticuli (some star in the small constellation Reticulum).    Yeah! Right!    Charlatans associated with Nancy had a book for sale on how to survive the end-of-the-world of 2003.    Well, 2003 came and went, and many of us actually managed to survive the end-of-the-world... and we had not even bought their book.    So they revised the book, they changed the date to 2012 (already made popular by astrologers and by Jos). They added Nibiru and Nemesis (two more fictitious bodies) to their Planet X, and they created fake documentaries for YouTube and for television.    The matching 2012 "predictions" by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Egyptians and so on, were also created after 2003 (otherwise, they would have contradicted the 2003 end-of-the-world prediction).    You have to admit that the marketing is far better for 2012 than it was for 2003. A lot more people are talking about the 2012 end-of-the-world than they were about the 2003 end-of-the-world.    But it is still fake.|`|6v1LIdcaaa	Rumors, most of the time, are just what they are, rumors.

No, I won't (if you search you will find all kinds of sites dedicated to lying to you or misleading you).|`|ndjVs0ELaa	forgot bout that stupid prediction.....|`|2JeCyjF8aa	I believe there is something significant about the end of the great cycle for the mayan calendar, although Im not so sure the calendar has been correctly translated, its kinda odd that it would happen to be a date of 12/21/12, if nothing happens in 2012 its only because the calendar wasnt correctly interpreted, not because the mayans were wrong in predicting some major shift in the way we live. It is scientifically accepted that the mayans created the most advanced and accurate way of measuring time, our calendar is based around artificial time meant to only be a way of keeping track of our social structures. This can be seen in the inconsistent leap year, and 12 month calendar. A more accurate way of representing time is to use a 13 month calendar, each with 28 days. I believe we are living in a special time where great things will happen, unlike anything else that has happened for thousands of years.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

This pressure builds and builds until the strain is so great the rocks can no longer bear the tension. Suddenly, there is a movement that releases all the energy some of which has been building up over years. This released energy travels through rocks in the form of vibrations called seismic waves. The waves travel outward from the spot where rocks of the earth's crust snapped under the strain. This spot is called the hypocenter. The spot on the earth's surface right above the hypocenter is called the epicenter. Earthquakes are felt the strongest at the epicenter.|`|PqG7ZPX1aa	maybe california?|`|Q2DY4Mimaa	The Ring of Fire  or the epicenter (the point of the start of the earthquake)|`|6doMlTGoaa	San Francisco in 1908 T.T|`|gF1YoEWSaa	California, Japan, Turkey, and China|`|SKlBAtPjaa	JAPAN.|`|7mjB9maOaa	In the Middle East, I think...........but I'm not 100% sure xP|`|1umOKLqoaa	like where california is. like the ends/sides of the tectonic plates.|`|K8BDsapcaa	The epicenter.

Somewhere, beyond the trench area, there are continental plates, which move at a very slow rate, the rate of the growth of a fingernail. When they move sliding on each other,they cause an earthquake, which erupts, therefore causing big currents, that drive in all directions at great speed, sometimes causing monsoons(floods), and/or tsunamis. Scientists measure earthquakes based on how much damage they cause; they even made a system, called the earthquake-magnitude- the hgiher the magnitude, the stronger the earthquake. When an earthquake has a high magnitude, it can cause even a mega tsunami, which is never seen before more than i think 3 times. What i mean is, very little occur, and a mega tsunami is basically a tsunami only like 100 times stronger. It's currents can be like 200 yards tall, and can flood a whole city, maybe even more. Land earthquakes, occur mostly around the california area, aroudn fault lines, and china. All this information is based on what i learned in 5th grade. peace
I0XEVeUxaa	I live in Turkey.    One thing I can tell from the stories of marine divers are that the marine sponges (members of Porifera) are disappearing from their usual places and numbers.    The Anatolian plateau was deforested by centuries of human civilization for at least 1500-2000 years.  It has certainly affected its climate, since the less biomass causes windstorms that lift away topsoil.  The Turks have a reforestation plan, which is more or less being implemented.      Unfortunately human populations, particularly those of ignorant or uncaring cultures with respect to nature, have devastating effects on climates locally.  The loss of large areas of rain forests (such as Amazon) will have severe effects.  Turkey has 75 million inhabitants, about the same population density as California, BUT Californians have a more devastating effect on climate because Turks tend to live in highly dense cities, living in multi-floor flats, whereas Californians prefer suburban homes with front and back yards, something most Turks and other Mediterranean dwellers don't really have.|`|DU2THcAdaa	You'll find a lot of info in this report from the IPCC: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report...

5mhSeHFDaa	This is a two step problem.  First you need to know the heat capacity of water in the liquid state.  Then use the equation:  Energy in Joules = heat capacity x mass x change in temperature    This will give you the energy needed to raise the temperature to 100.0 degrees Celsius.    Now you have raised the potential energy of water to the point of vaporization you need to calculate the amount of energy needed to completely break the intermolecular bonds, those are the ones inbetween the water molecules, so that the water can go into the vapor state.  For this you will need to know the heat of vaporization of water which is given in joules per mole that is how many joules of energy per mole of water will it take to go to the vapor state.  Convert the grams of water to moles and multiply heat of vaporization by moles of water and add the two energies together.|`|dLlbo591aa	1.143x10^6 J    You use the equation Q = mct  Q = heat needed  m = mass  c  = specific heat of water  t   = temperature    so    Q = 0.19 x 73.38 x (100 - 18) = 1.143x10^6 J      Below is a website that explains further and helps solve your equations.

It's very clean and simple.    = ln| x - 1 | - ln| x + 1 | + C    Done!

When looking at fees, you have to look at all of them.  The water rate in Champaign are obviously subsidized if they are that low.|`|AA12081834	Twice as much stuff to transport?

Its pretty much self explanatory that sewage is needing to be treated to into more useful stuff unlike water its clean and is sanitary. The cost for your sewage is for the chemicals and stuff used to process it to more useful things if possible or the process of recycling it if any is able to be recycled ( trash not bodily waste ) for bodily waste its nasty job and the chemicals are powerful and not cheap used to clean the stuff either but in the end its mainly used to destroy the waste. Well enough said thats why.

They conclude that Edison's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance lamp that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.  Another historian, Thomas Hughes, has attributed Edison's success to the fact that he invented an entire, integrated system of electric lighting. "The lamp was a small component in his system of electric lighting, and no more critical to its effective functioning than the Edison Jumbo generator, the Edison main and feeder, and the parallel-distribution system. Other inventors with generators and incandescent lamps, and with comparable ingenuity and excellence, have long been forgotten because their creators did not preside over their introduction in a system of lighting.|`|8ed76dc0214166dbab342f5721853980aa	THOMAS ELVA EDISON invented electric bulb

You can make one quite quickly if your lab does not have a small one.  Set up a piece of polaroid above a light (ideally monochromatic, but I've done it by standing placing the polaroid on an overhead projector) and put a measuring cylinder above it.  Fill the cylinder (always to the same level in different experiments) with the sucrose solution and use another piece of polaroid and a protractor to measure the angle of rotation of the polarised light.

Update flood procedures for your family, farm or business  (every year):  Make sure everyone knows the emergency phone numbers, and when to call them.  Learn the safest route from your home or business to high ground.  Make arrangements for housing in the event you need to evacuate your home.  Establish meeting places and phone numbers in case family members are separated by rising flood waters.  Teach all family members how and when to turn off gas, electricity and water lines.  Talk to neighbors and share information on facts about floods, preparedness and previous experiences.  Remember, the next flood can always be bigger than floods you have seen before.  Buy sand and sandbags ahead of time.  Learn how to use sandbags from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Minimize flood damage:  Store valuables at higher elevations (second story, if possible).  Store household chemicals above flood levels.  Ensure that underground storage tanks are fully sealed and secure.  Close storm shutters and sandbag doorways.  Have check valves installed in building sewer traps to prevent flood waters from backing up in sewer drains.  Move vehicles and RVs to higher ground.  Keep emergency supplies on hand: Family Emergency Kits  Portable radio, emergency cooking equipment, flashlights, fresh batteries, non-perishable food and drinking water, essential medicines and a first-aid kit.  Consider purchasing a NOAA Emergency Weather Radio  Keep street drains, storm grates and flap gates free of leaves and other debris.  Consider buying flood insurance to protect your property.  Homeowners' insurance does not cover flood loss, but most homeowners' insurance agents also sell flood insurance. Anyone can get flood insurance, even if you are located in an area not mapped as a floodplain, or even if you have never been flooded before.

wSRHWpItaa	Because at no other time in the cell cycle are single DNA molecules supercoiled (forming a chromatid).    The only other time single DNA molecules exist is during interphase. During interphase the DNA molecules are unwound because they are being actively transcribed. In this unwound state they exist as chromatin; the filler of a nucleus.    By the time the DNA molecules get supercoiled into chromatids they have replicated themselves. The two daughter DNA molecules formed from each original DNA molecule hold onto each other so when they supercoil they form the characteristic TWO chromatid "X" shape of a chromosome.
qF5T3vZiaa	The link below goes to a scientific review of this topic as it relates to chromosome number in mammals. You can read the abstract at the link, or click on the Final Full Text graphic to get the complete review in pdf form.    In essence, the author argues that high chromosome number can be advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on the situation. His concluding paragraph says:    "In summary, I propose that there are  two competing strategies in chromosome  evolution and speciation. The first strategy  is characterized by chromosome rearrangements  leading to increased recombination  (e.g., increase in diploid number  or increase in fundamental number), increased  variation and adaptation to more  pliable habitats, and a decrease in the  probability of fixation of new mutations  (both chromosomal and genie). The second  strategy is characterized by chromosome  rearrangements leading to decreased  recombination (e.g., decrease in  diploid number or decrease in fundamental  number), decreased variation and thus  adaptation to a specialized or constant  habitat, and an increase in the probability  of fixation of any new mutations (both  chromosomal and genie). The route that a  particular lineage takes depends on its  starting chromosome constitution and on  the environmental changes it encounters."    In other words, more chromosomes means more variety among offspring, because there are more ways to mix and match (say) 20 chromosomes each from a male and a female than if there are only 6. At the same time, it also means less chance that a favorable new mutation can spread throughout a population (i.e. become fixed). The author argues these are undesirable effects for populations that live in constant, specialized habitats, but desirable effects for populations that live in variable habitats.

But, the Adder's Tongue Fern (Ophioglossum sp.) can have over 1400 chromosomes, depending on the exact species, and it doesn't appear to suffer any detrimental effects.    Chromosome number works differently between plants and animals, however:  In an animal, a polyploidy event during meiosis or mitosis (a non-disjunction that doubles the chromosome number) is almost inevitably lethal, with a few rare exceptions (like some nematodes).  In plants, these events happen all the time, and often cause new varieties (or even species) of plants to aise.|`|mgEiFNHSaa	In short, all having more chromosomes does is make organisms look like their parent generation.

Ct1Z2utdaa	there are blood vessels in the rectum that allow the drug to being absorbed very quickly and avoid what is called first pass metabolism.  This means that when something is taken orally it is taken directly to the liver on a first pass before it goes anywhere else in the body.  I don't know how much would be absorbed via the rectum of a multi-vitamin.  I would tend to think that some of the vitamins would be absorbed while others would not be absorbed at all.  Also since it is a tablet designed to be taken orally it compressed so tightly it would take a very very long time I would think to break down allowing some of the vitamins to absorb leaving behind a rather large amount of the tablet.  A supository is specially formulated to dissolve when it reaches the rectum at that temperature (which is why they are individualy wrapped and sometimes kept refrigerated) because these special butters dissolve at certain temps.

It is just a matter of multiplying, dividing by power of tens (10, 100, 1000)  k means a thousand, so kg means  1000g  c means one hundreth, and you divide the meter by 100 (like 100 cent in a dollar !)    So a cube of 1x1x1 meter is 100x100x100 = 1 000 000 cm3 (cubic centimeter) or 1 cm3 is 0.000001 m3 (just count the zeros !, 6)    So 1g/cm3 = 0.001kg/0.000001m3 = 1000 kg/m3     By the way, a cm3 of water weights 1g and a liter (a cube 10x10x10 cm) which is 1000cm3  is 1kg and a cubic meter of water is a 1000kg also said a metric ton.

Have fun|`|QEEweJUaaa	(The Snow as stopped for now)    Dartmoor, in the south-west of England, is a raised plateau of granite formed by wind and rain weathering its original mountains; erosion has left behind a moorland of hills topped by stone outcrops, steep valleys lined with trees, and meanderings of rivers, streams and blanket bog. Depending on the light and weather, the granite outcrops, called tors', sometimes appear to be man-made castle ruins, or enormous stone-age sculptures that contain a weird supernatural presence of their own.    The Moor rises steeply from the sea and this gives it the highest rainfall in the south of England; in winter a light snow comes quite frequently; and mists more frequently still when the cloud-cover is low, or when the air changes from cold to warm and back again. And then, as quickly as it forms, the mist blows away, shadows chase across the hills, and bright sun explodes the Dartmoor landscape with colour.    People have inhabited the Moor for millennia: ancient footprints are here in the stone circles, the remains of round houses, burial chambers, and imperious megalithic standing stones; medieval people left walls and field systems, quarries, lanes and bridges; and our own upland farmers keep a living landscape with sheep and cows, and the wild' ponies that have become the Dartmoor logo.    Dartmoor has protected itself for years through its misty weather, its mysterious landscape, and its magical stories, and because until recently it was difficult to get here, it is relatively unspoilt and wild. It is a wonderful, but also a difficult, place to live.

Is it because there is a hoax on the internet and you believe in hoaxes?    I will admit that it is a very elaborate hoax that has been prepared over many years.  It is based on the principle that if you can scare people, they will be willing to give you money to "be saved".      This is a principle that have been used by religion for thousands of years (so we know it works).    The 2012 hoax is based on three things (none of which can harm us, unless we decide that they will):    1) Astrology:  The position of the Winter Solstice (not a real object) crosses the Galactic equator (not a real object).  Some astrologers have decided that this could be an important event.    But then, astrologers have always thought that the position of stars and planets dictate our lives (false).    2) Calendar numerology:  On the date we call 2012.12.21 (21 Dec. 2012), an old Mayan day-count calendar reaches the date 13.00.00.00.00 -- the next day will be 13.00.00.00.01.  A fake expert (Jos) has decided that this special round figure must mean something grave (just like when our own calendar went from 1999.12.31 to 2000.01.01 -- that was also an "end-of-civilization" prediction)    Numerology has never worked.  It gets worst if you apply it to calendars, since calendars are not really linked to the workings of the universe.  They are based on past historical events.    My favorite end-of-the-world calendar prediction is for September 2020 (it is also a fake prediction, but it will be more directly linked with the Bible, so it has a better "scare factor")    3) Scaring people is fun and can be profitable.  A lot of the scary predictions about 2012 come from the same people who had predicted the end-of-the-world for... 2003.  There was this Planet X coming our way, was going to cause storms, tsunamis, even flip our poles.    These people had a book for sale on how to survive the end-of-the-world of 2003.  Most of us managed to survive without having to buy their book.  So they rewrote the book, changed the date to 2012, added more features to their Planet X (e.g., Nibiru and Nemesis features).  They also prepared fake "documentaries" for television and for YouTube.    You have to admit that they are doing much better advertising for the 2012 version (more people are talking about it than for the 2003 version).    But it is still fake.    I'm sure that they are already planning the next version (I figure that there will be two more versions before 2020).|`|5H7Wgaknaa	The Mayan Long Count calendar clicks over from 12.19.19.17.19 to 13.0.0.0.0 on 21st December 2012.

jKvA9jwzaa	Presence of variety of plants and animals in an area make  good and effctive ecosystem:  The source of all food is the activity of autotrophs, mainly photosynthesis by plants.   They are called producers because only they can manufacture food from inorganic raw materials.   This food feeds herbivores, called primary consumers.   Carnivores that feed on herbivores are called secondary consumers.   Carnivores that feed on other carnivores are tertiary (or higher) consumers.   Such a path of food consumption is called a food chain.     Each level of consumption in a food chain is called a trophic level.     At each trophic level,   Net production is only a fraction of gross production because the organisms must expend energy to stay alive. Note that the difference between gross and net production is greater for animals than for the producers - reflecting their greater activity.   Much of the energy stored in net production was lost to the system by   decay   being carried downstream  Note the substantial losses in net production as energy passes from one trophic level to the next.   The ratio of net production at one level to net production at the next higher level is called the conversion efficiency. Here it varied from   17% from producers to primary consumers (1478/8833) to   4.5% from primary to secondary consumers (67/1478).   From similar studies in other ecosystems, we can take 10% as the average conversion efficiency from producers to primary consumers.|`|F2ICQKmBaa	1) For maintaining a balance in the food chain  2) For maintaining o2 and co2 balance in the atmosphere    thats all i think of right now :-) hope it helps|`|knKrLZu6aa	search on www.wikipedia.org

gZPxJpSVaa	Taking your questions in order:  1.  If 237 gm. of K2SO4 dissolve in 1 liter of water, then each   milliliter will contain 237 milligrams.  75 ml. will contain 75 times  237 mg, or 17775 mg. which is the same as 17.775 grams.  2.  If the 25-ml. flask is full with water & metal, and 21.3 milliliters  are water,  the remaining volume must be the volume of the metal.  The metal volume is 25 - 21.3, or 3.7 ml.  If the mass of the metal  is 11.6 grams, its density is its mass divided by volume, or   11.6 / 3.7, or 3.135 grams per ml.|`|Ne5I7Ranaa	1.  75 mL / 1 L = .075 / 1 = .075  237g * .075 = 17.775g    2.  To solve this one, we use the principle that any solid fully submerged in a liquid will cause a displacement equal to its volume. So, since the flask reads 25 mL, but only 21.3 mL are water, the metal must have a volume of 3.7 mL. A milliliter is the same as a cubic centimeter, so since we'll be measuring the density of a solid, let's use cubic centimeters.  Density = Mass / Volume  The mass is 11.6 grams, and the volume we found to be 3.7 cm^3, so the density is 3.135 g/cm^3 (or g/mL).

I hope I get best answer!|`|VVWoudjnaa	Sound is a mechanical wave ie. it needs a medium to travel   sound is transmitted through any medium in form of wave which is characterized by conseqtive compressions and rarefactions (crests and troughs) . So it moves with the oscillation of particles of medium through which it passes letting the transfer of energy.  as particles are much nearer in solids so it moves fastest in solids followed by liquids and slowest in gases. Some other factors also influence rate of movement of sound lke temperature which actually affects kinetic energy of particles.

1e8ca8ab530a9730b725fa637728d753aa	the space station is working on that, growing food, recycling everything and over-coming problems that arise with prolonged space missions.    the concept of the mission is that they go equipped to deal with everything and fix problems that arise.    the idea of a supply sat orbiting and possibly landing on the planet also is both credible and intelligent, and definitely a very good one.    as i understand the mission as it is shaping up, if the explorers left today, got there and turned around and came back, they would be gone for about 4 to 5 years depending on the location of mars when they left. the window if i remember is very small for a launch date.    in the early days of moon exploration, the first mission missed its landing zone by a huge margin, and others got better at getting to the area they wanted.    the missions were scrapped early, as a death on the moon, was a political hot potato, NASA could not deal with.    with the loss of 2 shuttles now and crew, dealing with a fatality on a mars mission is perhaps more easily dealt with and future missions would go on.    i honestly hope we have no more deaths, though exploration is written in blood, sweat, terror, exhilaration and lives|`|RfOLqUKlaa	This is an opinion, not a question.

The only advice I would give about using Ambien, is to make sure that you have someone with you the first few times you use it, and tell them to keep an eye on you.  Some people have reactions to Ambien such as sleepwalking, cooking in their sleep, DRIVING in their sleep, etc.  Have someone watch you to make sure you don't get up and do things during the night.  If something like that happens to you, then either stop taking it, or NEVER take it when you're home alone for the night.|`|JIATcwW6aa	If this is what is prescribed, try it.

Any star visible in the northern hemisphere could be called a northern star.    If you mean "what is the North Star" that is a totally different question.  The North Star (also known as Polaris) is the star in the northern sky that our rotational axis points to.  Think of the Earth as a giant spinning top, and extend the axis (the line it spins on) into the sky - it appears to point to Polaris.  This means that the North Star never sets - it is always in the same general spot in the sky.  And since it appears close to the magnetic north pole, it is the star that people can use to help them find north (helps to navigate at sea).
poEJEuwNaa	OK, how to do it:    First, look up the Laplace transform of e^(3x)cos(4x). (Should be in the tables.) Let's call that F(s).     Then the Laplace transform of xe^(3x)cos(4x) is -F(s).    In fact in general the Laplace transform of x^ne^(3x)cos(4x) is (-1)^nF^(n)(s), meaning the nth derivative of F(s). I think that is the step you have been missing.    I get ((s-3)^2-16)/((s-3)^2+16)^2. A little algebra shows that's the same as your answer.    Actually, I just thought of the easier way. Say you have a function f(x) with Laplace transform F(s). Then the Laplace transform of e^(ax)f(x) is F(s-a). A simple subsitution in the integral shows this.    In your example, you look up the Laplace transform of xcos(4x) in the tables. If that is not in your table, you can still use the derivative prinicple above.    The Laplace transform of cos(4x) is s/(s^2+16).     Using the derivative, the Laplace transform of xcos(4x) is (s^2-16)/(s^2+16)^2.    Thus the Laplace transform of xe^(3x)cos(4x) is ((s-3)^2-16)/((s-3)^2+16)^2.

Aluminum is one of the most cost-effective materials to recycle. When recycled without other metals being mixed in, the can/lid combination is perfect for producing new stock for the main part of the can  the loss of magnesium during melting is made up for by the high magnesium content of the lid. Also, reducing ores such as bauxite into aluminum requires large amounts of electricity, making recycling cheaper than producing new metal.----------------------------------...  Many consumers find the taste of a drink from a can to be different from fountain drinks and those from plastic or glass bottles. In addition, some people believe that aluminum leaching into the fluid contained inside can be dangerous to the drinker's health.[6] The exact role (if any) of aluminum in Alzheimer's disease is still being researched and debated, though the scientific consensus is that aluminum plays no role in the development of the disease [7][8]. Aluminum cans contain an internal coating to protect the aluminum from the contents. If the internal coating fails, the contents will create a hole and the can will leak in a matter of days. There is some difference in taste, especially noticeable in beer, presumably due to traces of the processing oils used in making the can.------------------------------------... cans are generally produced through a mechanical cold forming process that starts with punching a flat blank from very stiff cold-rolled sheet. This sheet is typically alloy 3104-H19 or 3004-H19, which is aluminum with about 1% manganese and 1% magnesium to give it strength and formability. The flat blank is first formed into a cup about three inches in diameter. This cup is then pushed through a different forming process called "ironing" which forms the can. The bottom of the can is also shaped at this time. The malleable metal deforms into the shape of an open-top can. With the sophisticated technology of the dies and the forming machines, the side of the can is significantly thinner than either the top and bottom areas, where stiffness is required. One can-making production line can turn out up to 2400 cans per minute.    Plain lids are stamped out from a coil of aluminum, typically alloy 5182-H49, and are transferred to another press that converts them to easy-open ends. The conversion press forms an integral rivet button in the lid and scores the opening, while concurrently forming the tabs in another die from a separate strip of aluminum. The tab is pushed over the button, which is then flattened to form the rivet that attaches the tab to the lid.    Finally, the top rim of the can is trimmed and pressed inward or "necked" to form a taper conical where the can will later be filled and the lid (usually made of an aluminum alloy with magnesium) attached.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_ca...|`|JWk1lKJgaa	an aluminum can is made out of aluminum just like the pyramid on the top of the Washington Monument|`|hXwX8dwsaa	the can is made of aluminum but it's personality smells like beer|`|ZQdKUrOYaa	aluminum

CY495kiYaa	If you can film yourself throwing a ball you can use the program "World in Motion" (aka "Physics Toolkit) to calculate the angle.  Basically this program will allow you to find the angle you typically release the ball at by analyzing a screen shot of you throwing the ball.    If you can film yourself throwing this program will EASILY tell you the angle.  However you'd probably need to do multiple throws in order to determine the AVERAGE angle.    http://www.physicstoolkit.com/index.html      anagah.|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	you could call it a carpenter square it has a 45 degree angle. that's what my husband says n.e.ways...?
ycbkzprjaa	Kinetic energy = (1/2)mv2  Momentum = mv  Sorry for the delay. The answer would be yes only if they had the same mass. For all other conditions, the answer is no, the momentums would be different because of the v2 factor.|`|7uAB1gAWaa	NO.  kinetic energy is 1/2 the mass times the velocity squared: KE=m*(v^2)/2.    Momentum is mass times velocity: p=momentum=mv.    Since the relationships are not both linear (one involves the square of the velocity), one could easily find an example where the kinetic energies are equal but the momentums are different.  Consider a block of mass M1=1 kg and velocity v1=2 m/s, and another block of mass M2=4kg and velocity v2=1 m/s.  Here the kinetic energy of both blocks would be 2 kg m^2/s^2.  But the momentums would be p1=2 kgm/s and p2=4kgm/s, i.e. twice as much momentum!!

hnhWxgZuaa	The normal vector of a line is defined in the 2-dimensional space. Usually we do not define such a notion for a line in the 3-dimensional space.     In the 2-dimensional space, a line is expressed as a(x-p)+b(x-b)=0, which has (a,b) as a normal vector. A 3-dimensional analogy to that equation, is a(x-p)+b(x-q)+c(z-r)=0, which represents a plane. In this equation, P(p,q,r) is a fixed point and Q(x,y,z) is any point, on the plane. Then the equation shows that the dot product of the vector (a,b,c) and the vector PQ equals zero, i.e., (a,b,c) is a perpendicular vector to the plane. So (a,b,c) is a normal vector of the plane.    The example you gave : (x,y,z)=(1,-1,1)+(2,3,-1)t  (*)  represents a line, which has the direction vector (2,3,-1) and pass the point (1,-1,1).  In the 3-dimensional space, if we define the normal vector of a line to be a perpendicular vector to it, we can find a normal vector of (*).  The plane perpendicular to (*) passing (1,-1,1) is,   2(x-1)+3(y-1)+(-1)(z-1)=0.  Take two distinct points A,B on this plane, you will have a normal vector AB for (*).

l2BjWA5Baa	17/(5x-10)   ----------------  (34x+51)/(3x-6)    I hope you can follow this format! What a mess to try to show.    The important concept here is to understand the definition of division: to divide by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal    -for example, 3/2                 is the same as 3/2 * 4/3, right?                       ------                        3/4  Then you just multiply across to get (3*4)/(2*3), which is 4/2, which is 2.    The same principle that we use to divide numerical fractions applies to polynomial fractions.  So let's walk through the first one.    17/(5x-10)                                           ----------------            is the same as        (34x+51)/(3x-6)                          17                    (3x-6)  -----            *    -------------  (5x-10)            (34x + 51)    which is 17(3x-6)             ----------------          (5x-10)(34x+51)    Factor all of the terms (email me if you're rusty on this) to give you     (17)(3)(x-2)  ---------------------             -> cancel out the (x-2) and the (17)  (5)(x-2)(17)(2x+3)    leaving you with   (3)(x-2)  ----------  (5)(2x+3)    And that is as simplified as it gets!    Try the others yourself, and email me if you need further help or want to check answers.  Just take a deep breath and keep in mind that the same rules that apply to working with any actual numbers (fractions, exponents, etc) apply to polynomials.

BAHT7zZWaa	The answer is a given (ATM) but let me put it into prospective.     The Voyager 1 is the furthest object man has sent out into space, it way past Pluto and is still seeing many moon like objects orbiting our sun. In other words still in our solar system.  It's about 10 billion KMs from earth. 0.001 light years.    Our closest star 'Alpha Centauri' is about 4 Light Years away. A light year is about 10 trillion KM (a thousand billion).    The Milky Way itself is about 100,000 light years across! That's absolutely mind boggling, it's very hard to comprehend... really.    Now the closest Galaxy to us is surprisingly close. The Canis Major Dwarf galaxy is only 25,000 Light Years from the edge of the Milky Way. But probably wouldn't want to go there as the Milky Way is 200x bigger and is currently ripping it apart as it orbits us.    The first "real galaxy" or 'spiral galaxy' closest to us is the Andromeda Galaxy and it's about 2.5 billion Light Years away. But we probably won't have to go after it because it's heading towards us and we will collide in about 3 billion years.  The good news about that is that it isn't necessarily doom and gloom. We will merge, and it's impossible ATM to predict if our solar system will even be hit by another star. Think about the great distances between stars.    So that's about what we are up against.    There is talk in the scientific community about how we are going to get to other solar system (not so much other galaxies yet) and there are some great ideas.  One is sending out and an frozen embryo pod in a ship that is continuously accelerating by tiny amounts of propulsion for the whole trip. Of course we'd have to be able to raise those embryos and that's an entirely different problem.

Will we be able to breath underwater? Will be able to time travel? The world has many questions to it, and space travel is one of them.    At this time period, sadly no, us humans don't have high enough technology to withstand the force of space and travel into deeper galaxies. We have been traveling into space for many years now, but sadly we have not reached the outside world of our galaxies.    To be honest, there is no possible way of telling if we will be making it to other galaxies any time soon, or at all. However, as you probably know, humans are evolving everyday. We are creating new inventions, upgrading our tools and so much more. There is a very small chance however we will be able to reach other galazies in the long distance future, only time will tell.     Who knows, maybe some aliens of another galaxy (if they exist) may have a higher intelligence than us humans and someday travel to Earth. Maybe we will uncover secrets of our pasts to unravel the travel of space. Their is always possibilities, and we need to use our noggins to conquore them.    Hope this helps!

They are combined in the exhaust nozzle (in the combustion chamber at the deepest point inside).  That is where the combustion takes place (separate from the fuel tanks)    Solid fuels are built and packed so that the combustion proceeds through the material at a controlled pace: lighting one end does not immediately light up the whole mass.  One layer must burn before the next layer catches fire.    Before they got it all correct, many rockets DID explode back in the late 1950s and early 1960s.    They do not use plutonium as fuel.    Some probes use a non-fissile isotope of plutonium in order to produce electricity (especially probes going away from the Sun, as solar panels would not be as efficient when very far from the Sun)|`|HkCXtuC3aa	The entire fuel supply IS used up, just not all at once. In liquid fuelled rockets they mix the fuel and oxidiser in the engine and ignite it there. Since there is a steady flow of material in one direction the fire doesn't reach the fuel tank, and even if it did the conditions inside the tank do not support combustion (they are pressurised with inert nitrogen or helium, so in the tank there is no oxygen to support combustion of the fuel anyway). It's rather like lighting the spray from an aerosol can: the fire doesn't go into the can because you're shooting the stuff that's burning away from it.    They control the level of thrust by controlling the rate at which fuel and oxidiser is added to the combustion chamber.    Liquid fuel rockets use kerosene or liquid hydrogen as fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidiser.     In the case of solid fuel rockets, the fuel can't all burn at once, just like a lump of coal burns slowly from the outside in rather than exploding.    Things do occsionally go wrong, usually with the engines, and this can lead to the destruction of the rocket and the uncontrolled combustion of the fuel if the tank ruptures.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Try this to start:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket    Then this one:  http://www.nasa.gov/|`|V92XxThoaa	There isn't as much pressure on it coming out, because the speed it goes is lower than when it "crashes" back into the Earth.

r1hURLPAaa	Going down from Li, Na, K to Fr the reactivity decreases, but these metals react easily  for example, with water, in a very exothermic way. This lowered reactivity is related to the atomic weight. As the mass of the nucleus increases with each neutron and proton, so also does the number of electrons (to balance the electric charge). Because these electrons are all at a greater distance from the nucleus, the energy gained from removing one electron diminishes according to the proportionality of r?2. The one free electron in the outer valence shell is in a so-called s-orbital. In all these metals there is only one free electron and these ball-shaped orbitals are denoted by 1s, 2s, 3s, etc., all with an increasing average radius from the nucleus. For all the subsequent groups, characterizations can be formulated based upon similarities in reactivity  the way they react, how many electrons can be shared, etc. As a result, the likelihood of reactants to be able to react together can be determined from the Periodic Table of Elements.     The reason for the decrease in activity as you move down the group is the increasing atomic size and increasing numbers of electron shells. Unlike group 1 elements, the halogens need to gain electrons when forming ionic compounds, so the greater the pull of the nucleus, the greater the chance of gaining an electron. Large halogen atoms such as iodine have a strong shielding effect from electron shells, so they find that gaining an electron is a more difficult task than for a small atom such as fluorine. We can arrange the these elements into a REACTIVITY SERIES which is a kind of rank order in which the most reactive is first:- F > Cl > Br > I.    for 2)   I want you to solve ur self..i will give u the example  Naturally occurring silver contains isotopes of mass numbers 107 and 109, with percentage abundances of 51 and 49 respectively.

Going through the cycle of Moon phases:    New Moon:  The Moon is near the Sun and the lit side is facing away from us.  We can't see it.  period.    First quarter:  the Moon is 90 degrees East of the Sun (to the left, if you live in the Northern temperate regions, like USA or Canada).    90 degrees = 6 hours     The First Quarter Moon rises 6 hours after the Sun.  This means that the Moon rises around noon.  When the sun sets, the Moon is at its highest point due south.  The Moon will set 6 hours after the Sun.    Three days after First Quarter (like around now), the Moon is not yet fully round, but it is much brighter (easier to see during the day).  It has gone about 135 degrees on its orbit (one full orbit = roughly one month).  135 degrees = 9 hours of Earth rotation.    The Moon rises around 3 pm, it gets to its highest point around 9 pm and sets around 3 am    At Full Moon, the Moon is opposite the Sun.  That is 180 degrees along in its orbit.  12 hours behind (or ahead, it's the same thing).    The Full Moon rises at sunset and sets at sunrise.      Last Quarter Moon:  rises at midnight (18 hours after the Sun, or 6 hours before, same thing).  It will be at its highest around sunrise.  It will set around noon.|`|AA11538887	Because it is bright enough.    The stars are in the sky during the day too, but they are not bright enough to see. Except that really bright star you can see high in the southwest just after sunset. That is actually the planet Venus. I saw that in the middle of the day earlier this week. That was because the sky was very clear that day and Venus is very bright and I knew there was a possibility of seeing it in daylight and looked for it. I knew just were in the sky it should be at that time and it took me less than a minute of looking to spot it. After that it was easy to see in the middle of a bright sunny day.

We see the moon because it reflects sunlight.  And the moon moves around the Earth, so the angle the moon makes with the sun changes through the month.  Sometimes the moon rises after the sun and sometimes before - when the moon is close to the sun in the sky (but not too close) we can still see it faintly if the sunlight isn't too bright (such as in winter).|`|xDHEy67taa	of course! depends on the time of the year/day, too.

AA11562326	You're talking about a photovoltaic (solar electric) panel, right?  A solar water heating panel would be significantly cheaper.    I'd recommend checking the internet (or even dig up old Yahoo Answers) on solar electric, and how a practical system is put together.  Usually, one does not specify the area of the panel, but the power that it should generate.  And the power comes from a calculation of your electrical needs.    But to address your question directly, the link below is to a panel that is about 16 square feet, and sells for $839 before rebates.  At that rate, solar panels to fill 150 square feet of area would be about $7500 - $8500.  You would then add another $2000 of stuff to make a practical system, including an inverter, wire, and mounting system.  Again, all these prices are before state and federal rebates.|`|eGTL0DTCaa	im guessing b/w 400 and above|`|ZQdKUrOYaa	200|`|RmwunqnQaa	That's a tough question to answer because it really depends on how many watts the solar panel is capable of producing. You could have a solar panel that size producing 80watts or one producing 200watts.     To figure out the cost just multiply the number of watts by $5 and you'll get a good rough estimate.

ycbkzprjaa	Here's a nice example. CBr2ClF.The name of this molecule is carbon dibromochlorofluoride. The least electronegative (metallic) element is written first in its whole name (carbon). The following elements are written in order of increasing electronegativity (nonmetal). Br  Another - SO2 is sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is less electronegative so it gets named first as its whole name. Oxygen is more, so it gets written next. There are two oxygens, so di- gets inserted.  Special cases are when acids are named. HNO3 is not hydrogen nitrotrioxide. It is named nitric acid. H2SO4 is not dihydrogen sulfotetroxide. This is named sulfuric acid. Notice the number one is never written in the formula. It is understood.  Years ago, we would imply valence states using special suffices. Ex: ferric, ferrous, cupric, cuprous, cobaltic, cobaltous, etc. Today it is more widespread to use Roman numerals because many elements' names do not go well with -ous or -ic. Also, many metals have more than two possible valence states.   I think when you ask crossing numbers, you refer to things like Al2O3, Ca3N2, etc. I understand. When there are more than two elements in a compound, you really can't cross numbers. Especially as in my first example, CBr2ClF. All those halogens are stuck to the middle carbon atom. No crossing here. I could go on, but this is a good start. As you become familiar with seeing it, hearing it, writting it, and working with it, chemical names become clearer in time. Good luck.|`|qEMhbw9Vaa	You only use the roman numerals when you have a combination of a metal and non-metal. Remember, you can only use roman numerals when the anion (non-metal) has more than one oxidation state. You can cross numbers, but that method is a lot more confusing. You only use prefixes when you have a combination has two non-metals.

Abandonment  When the well no longer produces or produces so poorly that it is a liability, it is abandoned. In this process, tubing is removed from the well and sections of well bore are filled with cement to isolate the flow path between gas and water zones from each other, as well as the surface. Completely filling the well bore with cement is costly and unnecessary. The surface around the wellhead is then excavated, and the wellhead and casing are cut off, a cap is welded in place and then buried.    The production from an oil well declines in production. The point at which the well no longer makes a profit and is plugged and abandoned is called the economic limit. The equation to determine the economic limit contains four factors, namely: (1) taxes, (2) operating cost, (3) oil price, and (4) royalty. When oil taxes are raised, the economic limit is raised. When oil price is increased, the economic limit is lowered.    .http://www.answers.com/topic/oil-well Ab...

AA11508270	I don't know if this is as easy as i perceive it to be, but here's a go at it.    Assume Z+ is bounded from above, then there exists an upper bound n, such that n >= k, for any k in Z+.    Let's add 1 to n, then you get: n + 1 which is also in Z+, and is greater n, so there exists no such n, hence  Z+ is not bounded from above.
l2BjWA5Baa	When we took algebra, we were simply taught your second equation there and expected to memorize it and use it as a model to help solve equations with actual numbers (like your first equation).      Approaching the first one from this point of view, it's easy to solve for b by taking the cube room of 216 (which is 6). Now you can plug that in for b (and x in for a, since that's your variable of choice) to get the factored form.

Your second problem is really the pattern.    When you identify the items that are being cubed, then you must write the two factors like you did - (a + b) (a^2 -ab + b^2).     For another example, if you had x^3 + 27, do you see that x and 3 are being cubed? x is our a, 3 is our b. When you see a^2, that means x^2 and -ab is -3x, so forth.    So to factor, (x + 3)(x^2 -3x + 9).    Some things are just better explained in person, not in typed words.|`|Y5NTFzZsaa	x^3 + 216 is x^ + 6^3, the sum of two cubes;  the sum of two cubes is the sum of the bases, times the square of the first, minus their product plus the square of the second:                             (x + 6) (x^2 - 6x + 36)    that comes from multiplying (a + b) (a^2 - ab + b^2) term by term, and gathering like terms at the end.
