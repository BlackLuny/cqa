AA10829445	Yes it is but all books by Michael Connolly are great.  He has written about 15 books with Harry Bosch as the protagonist - kind of a maverick detective in LA.  When I first found a Michael Connolly Harry Bosch novel, I realized it was a series & I looked up the list & bought & read them in order.  My suggestion is for you to do the same if you can and/or want to. Echo Park is kind of in the middle of the 1st 8 books.  I picked up what I thought was a brand new one ( Trunk Music) before my vacation in October & didn't know it was printed in 1998 until I finished it!.  So each one stands on its own but if you become intrigued with the character, it's best to follow them in order because there's a great development in his background & other characters in the series.  He also writes books that do not feature Harry Bosch it'll tell you on the cover if it does.  He is one of my top authors now.  His stories are extremely interesting & never fail to deliver.  I picked his book to read on my 9-10 hour flights & layovers to Israel.  I definitely recommend him & his books.
KYC8SrPnaa	I always buy my tights full footed and make my own holes because they are less expensive at my local dance supply store. I only buy convertible tights if I am going to need them for recital. To make them not fray, you can either use a lighter and carefully go around the hole so it singes the fabric, or sew around the outside. I personally like to singe the fabric.<br>  <br>  Happy Dancing!|`|XNNjFb4Laa	Two ways, A: sew around the hole that you cut, or B: singe the edges of the hole. <br>  But honestly buying the tights is so much easier!|`|05aKFYl5aa	i always bought mine

OHfZFR31aa	You do not have to be 18. That's already too old for most agencies. Elite will start signing girls to the Womens division at age 14 and most models are signed between 14-16 years old. You need to have a parent with you if you are under 18 as you cannot sign any contracts.<br>  <br>  Go to the open calls with both agencies just to see what it's like and what they say. If they think you need to lose weight, but love your overall look, they will tell you to tone up and come back in 6 months. If they think your facial features are still too young looking, they will tell you to come back in a year. <br>  <br>  Don't bother with a smaller agency if one of the big ones like Elite or Boss wants you. Girls with small agencies almost never move to a larger agenty - it happens but is VERY rare. Always shoot for the top.

Modeling classes would be of great benefit, it will show that you are serious.

wKKxUNzyaa	Finally someone else is thinking what I am thinking. I was seriously going to ask the same question! I can barely stand the frustration of my imagination conjuring up something so perfect, so amazing only to have it shattered by a simple word or a movie. Oh how I have come to hate novel's that have been made into movies all because something or someone in particular has ruined them for me!<br>  <br>  Lets use an example. I read Harry Potter as a young child. I could see myself in the story walking just behind Harry as if it were real. Harry was perfect. I thought I had him worked out entirely in both personality and appearance. But no. I cannot even remember how I once saw him. If i try to remember all I see is Daniel Radcliffe - No! I imagined something so different yet, that is all i can see now. It was ruined by a simple movie. <br>  <br>  Edward Cullen fits this exactly. But in this case not the movie but Breaking Dawn ruined him. I saw him at his worst. In ways I didn't need my favorite Twilight character to be seen by myself. I've found that all it really takes is a simple word or phrase or even image to twist what you once saw and ruin it forever. <br>  <br>  Oh why my imagination continues to tourture me i'll never know!|`|Xj6XZR89aa	yeah it's annoying it's a bit like when you read a book and then a film comes out and nothing is how you imagined it!|`|za9b8cHKaa	Yeah, it's interesting how we can picture on thing in our minds ... and then the author tells us something which completely changes our perception.<br>  <br>  What I find even more frustrating is when a movie comes out that is based on one of my favourite books and everything is different in the movie from how I pictured the characters/places.|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	Yeah that happens to me too, & i get frustrated when something happens to my favourite character, i'm like noooooo:[ lol x
Y4RS35M7aa	Like Iron Mike (Ditka?) I grew up in the 50s/60s and there were only three TV networks, but if you lived in/near a big city, you may have one or two more.  In Chicago, we had ABC, CBS, and NBC stations, plus WGN, and independent, and, of course, PBS.  Western shows were tops in the late 50s with every network, every night showing things like "Gunsmoke" "Wyatt Earp" "Wanted, Dead or Alive" and so many more.|`|kTNz1VJuaa	IronMike's story sounds just like mine. When I was young there was an automatic assumption that you would grow up, get married, get a job, have a couple of kids, and work your way up the hierarchy of the company. After 30 or 40 years in that company you would retire and tend your garden until you die.<br>  <br>  Sometime in the 1970's it became profitable for companies to "turn-over" their work force frequently to prevent the need to increase their pay and reduce the need to provide retirement plans and medical insurance for older employees. Along with this forced insecurity, & partly due to the "individualism" cult of the 1970's, it became fashionable to talk about changing careers in middle-age, largely as a part of "finding yourself". This worked out perfectly for those companies that wanted to cull the herd.<br>  <br>  The result has been that just a few years ago I heard one corporate executive ranting & grumbling to his friend that "Employees have no loyalty to the company any more" in spite of the reality that he and his friends helped create those conditions.<br>  <br>  Today it appears that I will have to work until I die of a disease that could have been prevented if I had insurance.|`|w5C0XrNOaa	I grew up in the late 50's and 60's and these were the prices of things, as best as I can remember: Milk was $.75 gal. and it came in glass jugs with a plastic handle for carrying it; gas was 25cents/gal.; a pair of blue jeans was $3-$5; most new cars were $2500-$3500; a 3br., 1 1/2 bath w/ 2 car garage in a decent neighborhood ran in the $15k price range; school lunch was $.35; most candy bars were 5cents; and movies were about $1.25, ($.75 for matinees). My 1st job was at a concession stand at a drive-in theater; I worked 4hrs. a day, 6 days a week and made $.50/hr + all the popcorn I cared for. Oh yeah, we used to buy 45's, (45rpm vinyl records - one song on each side), from the local vending company, (after they took them out of juke boxes), for 3 for $1. We only got 2 tv stations, (cable was just becoming available but most people didn't have it), and they both went off the air at 12:00 or 12:30. We did a lot of reading and bought used paper backs at a couple of places in town for 5-10cents. That's about all I can think of. Hope it helps.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	I grew up in the early seventies in Britain. I had a black and white television and there was no 24 hour TV and only 3 channels. There was no internet and no CDs or DVDs and the only media for playing music was either vinyl records or cassette tapes. Children were subjected to a lot more discipline than today and corporal punishment in schools was used regularly even on children as young as 10 and no one thought anything of it which is a radical difference to attitudes nowadays. Kids then were a lot more active- there were no video games to keep them indoors- and I spent most of my time outdoors doing things like fishing or playing soccer. I also read comic books which contained lots of non politically correct stuff like war stories that always portrayed the Japanese and Germans as incompetent buffoons while the allies were portrayed as the good guys.

zDBGLp3vaa	It is not "sir name".  It is "surname".|`|c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	I found this for you,<br>  Surname: Allen<br>  This distinguished surname with more than fifty heraldic Coats of Arms granted to nameholders, and having several notable entries in the British 'Dictionary of National Biography', is equally widespread in England, Scotland and Ireland. It derives from the Gaelic and Breton personal name of the pre-Christian era 'Ailin' which loosely translates as 'Little rock, although it may also mean 'harmony'. The first recorded name bearer was 'Alawn', a legendary poet of the fifth century a.d., reputed to be one of the three foremost musicians of the period. From early times the spelling form has varied considerably not least in the Celtic countries where it has ranged from Eilian to Alwyn and Alleyne. The Bretons, who were originally British settlers in France, returned as invaders with William, Duke of Normandy, otherwise known as 'The Conqueror' in 1066, and in so doing it is claimed, re-introduced the name into England. Certainly 'Alanus' without a surname, is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book for the county of Suffolk. Early surname recordings include those of Roger Alain of Yorkshire in the rolls of the village of Calverly, in 1246, and Richard Aleyns of Staffordshire, in the Assize Court Rolls of 1309. Other examples are John Allen, prebendary of St Pauls Cathedral, London in 1527, whilst in 1638 another John Allen was a puritan divine, and one of the earliest settlers in the New England colonial city of Plymouth, USA. The coat of arms most associated with the surname has the blazon of a gold field, charged with three black hounds passant, the crest being an eagle rising. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Geoffrey Alein, which was dated 1234, in the 'Feet of Fines' rolls of Cambridgeshire, during the reign of King Henry 111, known as 'The Frenchman', 1216 - 1272. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. <br>  Hope this helps.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	English and Scottish: from a Celtic personal name of great antiquity and obscurity. In England the personal name is now usually spelled Alan, the surname Allen; in Scotland the surname is more often Allan. Various suggestions have been put forward regarding its origin; the most plausible is that it originally meant ‘little rock’. Compare Gaelic ailín, diminutive of ail ‘rock’. The present-day frequency of the surname Allen in England and Ireland is partly accounted for by the popularity of the personal name among Breton followers of William the Conqueror, by whom it was imported first to Britain and then to Ireland. St. Alan(us) was a 5th-century bishop of Quimper, who was a cult figure in medieval Brittany. Another St. Al(l)an was a Cornish or Breton saint of the 6th century, to whom a church in Cornwall is dedicated. <br>  <br>  This is one of the family names I am researching.

OKPFeBtYaa	I found this answer on a website.  Because of the high number, I'm assuming it is adjusted for inflation.  However I could be wrong.  (1918 dollars and 2009 dollars are far different things)<br>  <br>  Russia $22,293,950,000<br>  <br>  A dollar figure does not do justice to the cost to Russia and the world that WW1 caused, for it brought about the Revolution that led to the original "Marxist-Leninist" Society, which became a form of totalitarianism rivaled only by the Nazis in cruelty.<br>  <br>  But this is more of a speculative question, because the war was a primary cause for the civil war in Russia, which essentially ruined the entire economy of the country.  Also the demographic loss of some many people (and many more during the civil war 1918-23)<br>  Russia entered the war to honor a series of interlocking treaties designed by European powers in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Because there were about 5 countries of about equal strength in Europe, there was always the threat of the other 4 ganging up on one.  Europe had been very antsy of war after Napoleon and his acquistions and alliances of central European nations and the resolved to prevent that situation.<br>  However, they created a system of treaties that pitted half the continent (Russia, France, Britain) against the other half. (Germany, Austro-Hungary) with many other lesser players.  To make a long story short, an assasination of a monarch in Austro-Hungary provoked an attack on a lesser country that was allied to Russia, so Russia was forced to declare war on them, and the dominoes began to fall.  <br>  If it sounds like a dumb reason to go to war, its because it is.  <br>  Russia internally had its own problems and was proving less and less able to modernize as the British had done so successfully during the industrial and agricultural revolutions of preceding centuries.  It really had no business playing power politics in Europe, but its size, population, and potential made it  relevant to all of Europe.    <br>  Russia had lost the last two wars it had fought, and the Romanov Tsars were itching for a chance to show their prowess to the world.  First the Russians were smashed by the British and French at Crimea in the 1850's and then got beat by the Japanese in 1905. --quite shameful in a time Russia considered itself a superpower and was beat by a country that at the time was seen as sub-human and stupid. <br>  <br>  So yes, I think your idea has merit.  Tsar Nicholas II bungled just about everything he did, but he did want to prove his military might, and he went to the front in uniform and act as commander in chief.  <br>  He liked to dress up like a soldier, but lacked the brains and the force of character like Peter the Great or Ivan the Terrible, and the times were against him.  The russian autocracy was the most repressive in the entire European continent.  Europe had advanced beyond that by some time.<br>  Nicholas II wasn't as evil, like Stalin, he was more a good natured bungler, like Bush in more modern times.  Only Nicholas had to pay for his ignorance with his life.|`|LRv8SA4Vaa	Not sure. but I do know it cost Germany trillions in today's money, which took them till 1998 to pay it all out.

iNXqiDIYaa	i can't find anything about longenecker but have found this which suggests the poem was not written by him and has a different title<br>  <br>  Question<br>  Hello, <br>  <br>  I would like some help determining the true author of a poem.  While watching a TV program that showed short "best-of" segments of its interviews with sports heroes over the past decades, I was surprised to see an early '70s clip during which a burly, African American linebacker quoted this poem and gave it credit as being a major motivational factor.  Not an athlete myself, I found their subsequent discussion of winners/champions and psychology/attitudes to be quite interesting.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the ending lines of the poem are<br>  "Sooner or later, <br>  the one who wins <br>  is the one who THINKS he can."<br>  <br>  My online searches have turned up with a variety of titles, a variety of authors, as well as variations in the length/wording of the poem itself.<br>  Titles include the following:<br>  "Thinking"<br>  "The Victor"<br>  "The Man Who Thinks He Can"<br>  Authors credited with the poem include Napoleon Hill, Walter D. Wintle, and C.W. Longenecker.<br>  Many Web pages quoting this inspirational poem just list the poet as "Anonymous."<br>  <br>  I would appreciate any information you could provide.  Thanks! <br>  <br>  Answer<br>  Lucinda:<br>  <br>  I don't know how much light I can shed on this subject.  I belong to a group of international reference librarians -- more than 1600 strong in all parts of the world --  and we first got this question in April, 1996.  Although many people had various ideas about the various versions, authors, and titles [such as the ones you mention in your message], the general consensus was NOT to rely on the internet, but to go to the printed sources.<br>  <br>  And THAT created a problem, because we found not one, but TWO versions of the poem in respected anthologies of poetry.  Both versions were attributed to Walter D. Wintle, so I would go with him as your best bet.<br>  <br>  I don't, however, want to suggest that I [or the other librarians involved in this research project] have the ultimate and definitive answer.  Someday, someone might find yet another version.<br>  <br>  Here are the two Wintle versions and their printed sources:<br>  <br>  From "The World's Best Loved Poetry" -- latest edition published in 2002:<br>  <br>  The Man Who Thinks He can<br>  <br>  If you think you dare not, you don't;<br>  If you'd like to win, but think you can't,<br>  It's almost a cinch you won't.<br>  You've got to be sure of yourself before<br>  You can ever win a prize.<br>  Life's battles don't always go<br>  But soon or late the man who wins<br>  Is the man who thinks he can.<br>  <br>  Walter D. Wintle<br>  <br>  From "Poems That Live Forever," published in 1965:<br>  <br>  The Man Who Thinks He Can <br>  <br>  If you think you are beaten, you are; <br>  If you think you dare not, you don't.<br>  If you'd like to win, but think you can't <br>  It's almost a cinch you won't <br>  If you think you'll lose, you're lost,<br>  For out in the world we find <br>  Success begins with a fellow's will;<br>  It's all in the state of mind. <br>  If you think you're outclassed, you are.<br>  You've got to think high to rise. <br>  You've got to be sure of yourself before<br>  You can ever win a prize.<br>  Life's battles don't always go<br>  To the stronger or faster man; <br>  But sooner or later the man who wins<br>  Is the one who thinks he can.<br>  <br>  Walter D. Wintle, "The Man Who Thinks He Can." - Poems That Live Forever, comp. Hazel Feldman 1965 <br>  <br>  Lucinda -- The problem with these little "inspirational poems" is that they are written by unknown/obscure authors.  Other people take great liberty with the poems, changing a few words or lines -- and then TAKING CREDIT for a "new" poem.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you a little.  I advise you to go with Wintle, until some poetic archaeologist digs up an earlier version of the poem.<br>  <br>  Ted Nesbitt

Recent reports of French, Dutch and other rival powers activities in the region appear to be well founded, the Portuguese are certainly engaged in trading activity in the Goa area and have been for some considerable time. It would the french appear to be eying up these territories with a mind to acquiring them.  If the French were to establish bases on the continent, it would prove disastrous to our trade routes between the orient and England as the French would be able to close these routes at will in the event of war.<br>  I recommend we act immediately in order to tap the valuable resources of the region for the benefit of the crown as well as operate as a transit point for further eastward expansion.<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  Sir William "Sticky wicket" Weatherby-Smythe (Mrs)

6DMf7wrHaa	The words flow and your vocabulary is excellent but I would like to know what or whom the poem is about. I imagined a boy or girl talking about the love of their life but it could equally have been a description of fairies. However, I like poetry that rhymes and I definitely like yours. Keep at it and keep it rhyming. Good luck.|`|A9NBtUy6aa	I think it's very good!!<br>  <br>   Your only occasional problem is with rhythm/ metre- for instance the last line doesn't flow so well because it has too many syllables. <br>  <br>  You should try Helium.com- you can post it there and it gets rated against other poems under the title. You can then earn money (though i assure you, very little) if it's a good poem. I have a poem on there that has ended up on somebodies blog cos they thought it was really good... :-S|`|96wixYvMaa	woaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.<br>  <br>  holy shiz on a shiz-stick.|`|Y16olPxlaa	That's amazing.

You have a unbelievable command of language for a 13 year old. Would be interesting if there was a reason behind writing such a poem.|`|706faf24aed2821effd07a401fe0822faa	First off, you definitely have talent with vocabulary and phrasing. Each line is an individual treat to my imagery. Your retort is right as well, as I agree that rhythm can be adjusted. However, syllables themselves hardly grant rhythm, it is wording and punctuation that create the flow.<br>  <br>  My trouble is only with understanding the poem and its meaning, I watched your inspiration and could not concieve the same thoughts. However, this is my problem and not one to concern yourself with. For it is our individual understandings which cannot always be properly communicated or interpreted.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly, it feels to me as though each stanza should be a separate poem. I only felt a connection in the latter three stanzas. However, if you truly understand what you have written, then my advice is of no consequence.<br>  <br>  My advice is to keep writing but not to be satisfied. Even if you feel the work is golden, don't settle. Do as you have done by asking for reviews. I do the same. Take each compliment and critique with a grain of salt and alert ear. Judge the consequences of each advised change as best as you can and see where it takes you. Who am I kidding? You've gotten this far, you probably already knew this.<br>  <br>  Also, repay the favor. I would love to know what you think of my work sometime. Be harsh, be critical, just be honest.|`|Wh8APeXMaa	I think you have a good vocabulary, but you need to think about what you actually want to say. What is the poem supposed to mean? What points are you trying to make? How do you want the reader to feel? <br>  <br>  There are a lot of long words in there, but many of them aren't used correctly. For example, 'In a golden cloud of sunflower's ilk' doesn't make any sense. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you think about what you want to say, then try to think of the most compressed and accurate way of phrasing it, rather than just choosing words that sound 'poetic'.<br>  <br>  Finally, although the rhyme scheme is tight, many of the lines don't scan correctly. Try saying the poem aloud: if you have to pronounce words wrongly, cram too many words into one beat, or use unnatural intonation, then the scansion needs work.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA10729271	hmm, the poem is good, it has a nice sound when read aloud, but i agree that you need to work a little on your rhythm, in the last three stanzas the last line seems a little awkward, like in stanza three instead of 'in heaven she belongs' perhaps 'for heaven she longs' might fit a little better. Also your pronouns are a little confusing--get rid of the 'our' and the 'your', stick to direct references to to the angel in the feminine.<br>  <br>  Also i feel the first two stanzas are the strongest, (perhaps you wrote them at a earlier time, or did you writhe them all at once? i find if i get distracted when writing poetry sometimes you lose your zen) but perhaps if you polish up the last lines of the last three stanzas the imagery will flow better from each transition.|`|psmTrwT3aa	strangely nice and entrancing.|`|uu22BItnaa	fantastic, u didnt reallyneed to post it on yahoo because some1 else doing poetry might rob it<br>  EDIT:jason is a twit ignore him|`|3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	I think you have an excellent vocabulary for a 13 year old and it is a very nice poem.|`|JQXFG2ABaa	For someone of any age let alone only 13 I think your poem is<br>  excellent.

wKKxUNzyaa	Hi, if you were to use this concept for a teen novel you may need to consider actually giving them powers. The whole magical object topic has been used a considerable amount. But if these objects had some other significance than your idea could definitely work. Perhaps if they were discovered and "lost" many thousands of years prior to their "rediscovery" by your characters. That could work. But maybe them just owning the objects is really not enough. It needs something more.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck!|`|TWm5Smlaaa	for a children's book, definitely not a teen novel.|`|dwu1b36xaa	nothing special<br>  <br>  its been overdone sry|`|n7JACV0Iaa	no...not really not for teenagers but for the age group 8 to 10 it would be ok....|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	Not really..

ceBTTCPwaa	The Merchant of Venice is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. Although classified as a comedy in the First Folio, and while it shares certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is perhaps more remembered for its dramatic scenes, and is best known for the character of Shylock.<br>  <br>  The title character is the merchant Antonio, not the Jewish moneylender Shylock, who is the play's most prominent and more famous character. Though Shylock is a tormented character, he is also a tormentor, so whether he is to be viewed with disdain or sympathy is up to the audience (as influenced by the interpretation of the play's director and lead actors).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Merchant_of_Venice" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Merchant_of_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/mov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/mov/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/merchant/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/me...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-76.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/merchantofvenice/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/merchantofveni...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?article_id=604" rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMerchant02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/merchantvenice" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/mrchven.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/merchant2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/merchant2.html</a>|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Merchant of Venice<br>  <br>  study guides:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/mov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/mov/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/merchant/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/me...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerchantof.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-76.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/merchantvenice/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.william-shakespeare.info/shakespeare-play-merchant-of-venice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.william-shakespeare.info/shak...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/william-shakespeare/the-merchant-of-venice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/w...</a>|`|5Fwuya29aa	I'll try to answer your question directly.<br>  shylock hates antonio because antonio hate him simply because he is a jew and spits on him and mocks him for it.  Thus, when antonio is desperate for money, he seizes his chance to make a strange bargain.<br>  really he probably thinks antonio won't make the payment and he'll get his revenge.  so shylock wasn't too bothered about interest. plus, Shylock is a wealthy man, "rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats.<br>  <br>  as for antonio, obviously, he does not have the available cash to lend to bassanio, hence why he needs to borrow money.  and since his flesh would be at risk if they default on the payment, he obviously wants to make the debt as small as possible. why would you want to owe more money if you might die when you can't pay it back?<br>  <br>  another reason might be a racial one, not wanting to give a jew more money, cause interest is profit for shylock. that is just speculation.<br>  <br>  anyway, i hope this saves you time of having to look it all up.<br>  <br>  good luck.

There will always be different things going on & that is the same for the economic effect to each individual. I know I will survive it because of my level of consciousness. It is so different from most.My husband & I quit are jobs years ago. We learned to relax & enjoy life & feel secure no matter what our outer financial condition appeared to be. We do all kinds of work. My husband went out last week & fixed a leaky faucet & put a new tub in a house. I went out & helped someone who just remodeled their kitchen & needed to go though boxes to put everything back. This person has a huge house & a lot of money & I go organize it from time to time. Then I will go to another persons house this week who has a small house that really seems to just like me to talk to but I work as an organizer. I do healing work & astrology or intuitive reading. So we do all kinds of things & enjoy our life like this while others would feel insecure. So we will do well & I really think Obama is going to show us how to go from rags to riches Oprah style so I see this as a great opportunity but it can't work that way for a person who is putting him down.

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Flavia Bujor wrote her book 'The Prophecy of the Stones' when she was 13. <br>  <br>  The second step is practice. You could start by writing a couple of paragraphs every day. In this way, you can enhance both your vocabulary and your writing skills.<br>  <br>  Step three - write your story. You could write every day and then look back what you wrote the next day. In that way, you could edit your story for the better.<br>  <br>  Some feedbacks won't also hurt. You can ask your siblings or your friends or even your parents to read what you wrote.

LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises. For every 100 people that go through these scammy schools and lose their money, there will always be that naturally talented kid that gets work and that these scammy schools take credit for. <br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, Barbara Walters, Heather Locklear, Peter Fonda, Jane Fonda, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! Some of those celebs even threatened legal action for using their names. So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W.

It is NOT an agency, it is a school. The classes are a blast, and they are very fun and you learn a lot. They have about two auditions a month, and people do get agents out of them. I, myself, have received a callback before from one of the auditions. Yes, they are expensive, but as far as I'm concerned, very worth it. You're going to need some training if you want to get far as an actor, and this is a great way to start. You can get your headshots taken with them, they'll show you how to make a resume, and your classes will be extremely informative. Have fun!<br>  <br>  But remember, they do NOT take everybody who auditions, so good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you only want to be an actress/actor for the fame, I would not pursue it. You have to love it, and be willing to work hard. It's hard work, and there's a lot of rejection.

I got a call to a screening at their school just on 3/5/09, of course I was very excited and no sooner later after they talked with me they called my best friend and tell her to get a screening, my friend asked if she could bring friends to audition and stuff, they were so happy my friend swore she heard them choke. So anyways, after I told them I couldn't make it they were so rude to me, I think they said "Miss if you don't have the passion for this don't waste our time by calling" of course I said please make another time for me and they said I will call you back but they never did. My friend attended there for a years and still no change in her life.

After making the mistake, I was binded by a contract and had to make the best of it.<br>  <br>  The last day she had an audition to go to iPOP. Sure enough, she got selected. The price - about 6200 for her and because she is a minor she has to be accompanied by an adult which has to pay 2300.<br>  <br>  All in all, if you have about 11,000 dollars to burn, go for it.<br>  <br>  I have to agree; my daughter really like the classes and she was looking forward to go to the school every Sunday.|`|uvpQDBNCaa	I have multiple friends who attended John Robert Powers.

AA10570173	No. Borosilicate glass is harder and has a higher melting temp than moretti, which is a softer glass.

Oh, not that he's my ideal of the absolute finito. He tells little lies and worries about what people think and he wants to be the President of Brazil. I mean it's such a useless thing for a grown man to want to be and takes about fifty baths a day. I think a man should smell...at least a little bit. No, he's too prim and cautious to be my absolute ideal. If I were free to choose from anybody alive...just snap my fingers and say "Come here, you!"...I wouldn't pick Jose.

5wTjV6tKaa	"wall stretch" Lay down with your butt agaianst th wall and put your legs straight up the wall, like your sitting, but laying down lol. then slowly spread your legs and get into your middle splits. it might not be all the way down. Have someone push each leg down towards the ground (your still laying on your back) about an inch every 2-3 minutes.<br>  This is an excellent stretch and it doesn't put much stress on your legs. Do it 4-7 minutes for around 3x a week, you'll see a big improvement after a while<br>  Also, gravity is helping you out by pushing your legs down.<br>  <br>  this really works wonders, because it helps you acheive your splits without any body weight to force them apart.|`|EUJZdcO9aa	spread both you legs out facing the wall. do this everytime you strecth out or working to improve your flexibilty.<br>  push yourself into the wall until your mid section touches the wall<br>  another way is lift up your left [or right] leg in front of you straight out..dont bend.|`|Ht7F5vATaa	do the same as what Lyna said, but have some one push you into the wall. go as far as you can, hold it making sure your knees are down and back is straight, then go in further. just keep doing this until you are better
9Nw85MAdaa	Omg! I just finished Fiddler!!<br>  but I was cast as a "Woman"<br>  <br>  Yente- very fun role to play! she holds a lot of the humor of the play. I would've loved to play her. She's almost steals the beginning of the show.<br>  <br>  Chava- the part I wanted! She's a fundamental role because she runs off with a Christian man and is exiled from her family. She's quiet and nice, but comes out of her shell when she feels the need to stand up for what she believes in.<br>  <br>  Fruma Sara - we didn't have her in our production, which upset me because she would be so fun! With her you can be crazy and wild, you can fly around the stage and yell and wail. She would be a blast to play! <br>  <br>  All of these are very good parts, over all. I hope you enjoy your experience in Fiddler on the roof just as much as I did. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|zy5qcc0Raa	That's all fine. The little parts sometimes are the best because they show attention to detail, and that lots of people are involved and help make the overall show better than if it was just he main characters.

dlGP3iZ6aa	According to Immanuel Kant, there are two faculties of the mind:  theoretical reason and practical reason.  Theoretical reason allows us to answer the question, "What can I know?", while practical reason allows us to answer the question, "What ought I to do?".<br>  <br>  For Kant, practical reason issues a "categorical imperative" that commands us to act in a accordance with the dictates of reason.  There is only one categorical imperative, but Kant offers three formulations of it:<br>  1) Act as if your maxim were a universal law of nature.  What if everybody did this action? A "maxim" is a personal principle of action, such as "I will never lie," "stealing is wrong."  If your maxim is not one that can be universalized, then it does not issue from the categorical imperative. For example, if your maxim was "lying is permissible", then human relationships would not be possible because we would not know who to trust.  This formulation, then, can be summed up with the question, "What if everyone did this"?<br>  2) The second formulation goes as follows: Treat another rational being as an end in himself, not as a mere means.  This means that we should value the other person solely for who they are and not merely use them to serve our needs.  Of course, in daily life we cannot avoid this (you use the shop clerk in order to get your can of cola).  Kant's point is that a person should not be a "mere" means.  Treat that person as a rational being, much in the same way you would want to be treated.<br>  3) The third formulation is as follows: Act as if your maxim would harmonize with a kingdom of ends.  This means that the action should be consistent with a world in which people are treated as ends in themselves.<br>  <br>  Here's a couple of additional points you should keep in mind:<br>  1) An action is right in and of itself without appeal to consequences.  In this sense, Kant is a "deontological" thinker, not a consquentialist.<br>  2) Only rational beings are worthy of moral consideration.  If you are a dog or a tree, you do not fit into Kant's moral ontology.<br>  <br>  Universalizabilty principle = first formulation;<br>  <br>  Kingdom of ends = a state of human existence in which all rational people treat all other rational people as ends in themselves, not as mere means. (don't confuse it with an other-worldly realm; it's meant to be accomplished on earth)<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|44ujDxwqaa	The moral doctrine of Kant(Categorical Imperative) states that: " Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will rthat it should become a universal law". An imperative that denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that asserts its authority in all circumstances, both required and justified as an end itself. It means to say that a moral act is one that is good for one person in similar circumstances to those in whic the doer finds himself when he executes the action.<br>  <br>  The kingdom of ends principle is one which leads to the duty to further the ends for ourselves and others. If any person desires perfection of himself or others, it would be his moral duty to seek that end for all people equally.. It is also stated as:"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end an never merely as a means to an end. This also means in simpler form that always treat a person as not only a means to an end, but a person with dignity.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	"...that using reason without applying it to experience will only lead to illusions, while experience will be purely subjective without first being subsumed under pure reason"

hN3k3ggSaa	A historical Being - this depends on how influential he was in turning the tide for greatness or for infamy.<br>  An Actor - Did he travel through life convincing others or just himself?<br>  His Body - Was his body merely a commodity to use and abuse according to his vices, or a temple in which the healthy seed of altruistic consciousness grew?<br>  A Lover - To love one person is great, to love all mankind and all living things is noble.<br>  A Worker - a builder for good or evil.<br>  A Believer - the belief must always serve the person's greatest good and higher self, otherwise it is but a mere illusion.|`|tKFO3u60aa	as a historical being, man is like a destroyer<br>  as an actor, an influential, motivational soap opera actor<br>  as his body, a creator<br>  as a lover, a pleasurer<br>  as a worker, a shortsighted laborer<br>  as a believer, imperfect|`|GfNVcq7Naa	A man can only be as historical as the seeds he plants and nurtures in others. Gifts that root and grow are by far the most rewarding.<br>  I feel that in order to be able to do so, he must first accept the fact that he will also always be a student, one who can endure the truth especially within himself. And then be able to share the truth and deliver the basic lessons of life through insight.<br>  I also believe that pay it forward is a honerable way of life. Help others. Even if it costs you your glory, being a bridge is can proove to be more rewarding than glamour it's self.

Who listens to you and cares about you (because he wants to).<br>  <br>  Classical heroes are "Superman", Spiederman" Batman", etc....they are stereotypes: save the world from evil, look handsome (in most cases), have super-powers (what else ;-) ), and in the end they often sacrifice themselves for a loved person.<--- the last point is what I have said before ;-) <br>  <br>  well, that's crossed my mind when I read your question; dind' think long :D <br>  <br>  cheers|`|5VQUeO7aaa	The hero is one who has turned from serving self to serving others as an individuated, self-aware being, polarized to positivity.|`|M3pufPlnaa	Brave, smart strong, long hair, dreamy eyes =]|`|701f7763a843fdbdeed77525744179a3aa	don't afaid to tell the truth|`|hN3k3ggSaa	A Hero is a person who makes that split decision to forego his/her own safety for the greater good of others.

swiOhDo2aa	Greenie is right in the sense that Marx came from a Jewish family and so was ethnically Jewish.<br>  <br>  However, his parents were converted Christians, and Marx himself was brought up in their faith. Despite his background, Marx was ferociously anti-Jewish as well as being racist: he famously, and insultingly, called another Jewish socialist (Ferdinand Lassalle) "A most uncertain friend...a cross between a nig ger ('neger' in German; even more insulting, if possible, than the English equivalent) and a Jew".<br>  <br>  Nice guy, old Karl.|`|AA11304025	yes|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Karl Marx's Anti-Semitism<br>   <br>  <br>  Karl Marx, the progenitor of the most well-known strain of socialist theory in the last century, was born in the city of Trier in 1818 to a married Lutheran couple, both of whom had converted from Judaism before their son was conceived. Karl's father, Heinrich Marx, was descended from a distinguished line that was at the center of German Judaism all the way back to the fourteenth century, where one "Eliesar" was the rabbi for the Mainz community (the core of medieval Talmudic study). Both of Karl Marx's grandfathers were rabbis, and his uncle was the latest in a line of rabbis for Trier that stretched back to 1650. Members of Marx's family had been present for all the horrific events in the persecution of the Jews up to that point, including the 1418 expulsion of the Jews from Trier. "The family tree is itself the Book of Lamentations," James Carroll writes in his Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews. "Open it to any verse, and it will weep." Heinrich Marx was born as Herschel Levi, but changed his name and converted to Lutheran Christianity in his adulthood, possibly in response to the post-Napoleonic backlash against the Jewish Emancipation in Europe. Martin Luther was not known for his love of Judaism, nor could this be seen as anything but a central and integral part of his theological views. The Lutheran tradition in Germany was in no way particularly friendly to Jews - but it was the state religion, and considered far more "enlightened" than membership in the "archaic" Roman Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Karl Marx's mother was also a Lutheran convert from Judaism, and so when Adolf Hitler would refer in much later years to "that Jew Marx", he would be technically correct. Karl Marx, the son of a Protestant lawyer, was also a Jew, and one very aware of his family's history and rich heritage. And yet, Marx's true heritage was that of the Enlightenment and the previous century, particularly that of Voltaire, a prolific writer who denounced the decadence of the Crown and the Church, promoted modernity, democracy, and pluralism - and was also the first "modern" anti-Semite. Voltaire's disdain for the Jews issued largely from his admiration of his inspiration Cicero's own anti-Judaism, and allowed him to simultaneously denounce the horrific persecution of the Jews in the history of the Roman Catholic Church and to write in 1771 that the Jews "are, all of them. . .born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race." Marx knew that his father had indirectly agreed by shrugging off the legacy of his family and their traditional religion like an old cloak, as something outdated and unattractive that impeded his progress to becoming a successful lawyer and a model, and modern, citizen. The influence that this had on Heinrich Marx's son is not known, but Karl Marx would soon more avidly and directly voice his own disdain for Jews, largely in the terms brought by a dual legacy of Lutheran upbringing and study of Voltaire's own "Enlightenment" as to the role of Judaism in history.<br>  <br>  Karl Marx was educated in both Bonn and Berlin, where he became heavily interested in and influenced by G.W.F. Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach, falling in with the "Young Hegelians" who sought to use historical dialectic to understand the modern Europe that was still being created before their very eyes. Marx, upon returning to Trier in 1842, began to submit his own philosophical and historical articles to a Cologne newspaper, Rheinishe Zeitung, that showed the influence of his education. In 1843, Karl Marx's first essay of note was produced: "On The Question of the Jews". Feuerbach was notorious for his claim that the biblical and rabbinic YHWH was "nothing but the personified selfishness of the Israelitish people". But Marx would outshine his mentor in his virulence: "Money," he wrote, "is the jealous god of Israel, beside which no other god may exist." Marx was already distancing himself from his Christian upbringing, but his words were "barely more than a glib rehash of the twisted charges of Christian preachers" (Carroll). Marx reiterated a stereotype of Jews as capitalist puppeteers that was still in its earliest stages: "The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the trader, and, above all of the financier." Marx hoped to uncover what he called "the real Jew": <br>  <br>  Let us not seek the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us seek the secret of the religion in the real Jew. What is the profane basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly cult of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly god? Money.<br>  <br>  Very well: then in emancipating itself from huckstering and money, and thus from real and practical Judaism, our age would emancipate itself.<br>  <br>  An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Yep, just like Hitler...|`|RoLcpujNaa	yes, he was

3whhpHHvaa	If you are in any way familiar with the Tao / Taoism and other like ideas, you will be sure to find that deep thinking is not dangerous.<br>  <br>  In fact, in a lot of practices, such as those involving Meditation, Deep Trance, and intense periods of Silence, it is encouraged to think as deeply as possible. Elevated-level Meditation (speaking from experience with those who practice it) is not only intense concentration, it is soul-searching that influences you to not only think intensely, but even begin to think more broadly and ask more questions.<br>  <br>  Certainly, sometimes you come back without an answer. Sometimes, laying awake in bed at night - night after night - makes you start to lose faith that you have the answer to any particular question. But that doesn't make it dangerous. You will have a greater understanding of the question at hand.<br>  <br>  And you never don't "return." Even if you feel bemused or consumed, your mind eventually counters and recovers from its focus on a difficult question.<br>  <br>  Just remember, sometimes you will feel lost in thought even when you are not. Your brain continues to work on problems on a subconscious level long after you stop actively thinking about it. That's why taking a break or skipping a question temporarily during an algebra test used to work. Your mind keeps on truckin'. Don't fret - it moves on eventually.|`|3tyGltFcaa	Deep thinking is extremely dangerous for two three reasons:<br>  <br>  1. After awhile of deep thinking it will force you to look at different points of view so it will make it almost impossible to completely believe in a god and if their is a god and you dont completely believe in him than your screwed.<br>  <br>  2. It will make you go a little crazy when you realize just how bad the world is and when you realize some of the things you take for granted may not be real.<br>  <br>  3. Deep thinking makes you fall away from the real world.|`|wIb3bXTFaa	Depends on the kind of deep thinking.  Introspective deep thinking has been known to provide some people with profound epiphanies regarding their own lives, resulting in the kind of joy and contentness most people never find.  It has been known to drive others mad.<br>  <br>  Many great philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, and others who have contributed the most to the human cause, were deep thinkers who were often very troubled by the thoughts of a random, chaotic universe, or even the overall uncertainty of life and death.  While these men and women have been instrumental in giving us the comforts in the lives we now live (cell phones, mcdonald's, internet porn, etc), have won Nobel prizes and been revered by all those who would follow in their footsteps (though completely taken for granted by 99% of the population), they have done so at a great cost, as many of them were deeply troubled individuals, who died with more questions than answers, and who were unable to accept a life of simple hapiness.<br>  <br>  And now, on a much lighter note, "Deep Thoughts" by Jack Handey...<br>  <br>  "As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red<br>  again, I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing more than a<br>  bunch of honking and yelling?  Sometimes it seemed that way."|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Albert Einstein did my friend for he could not reconcile his relativity theory with that of quantum physics.  Einstein tried to explain the universe without the uncertainty of it all which is the essence of quantim physics.   Nevertheless he is regarded as a genius today.  <br>  <br>  This is why the spiritual leader who is a deep thinker seeks to put spiritual truth into practical living in the reality of their minds and lives.|`|r6ok7NbEaa	Beware of deep thinking?? Where would we all be if ALL of us actually sat down at least once a day, and got lost in deep thought? If we analyzed things to a deeper sense.

In an Alpha-state, I can sometimes hear what becomes full symphonic original music that I can do nothing but listen to in wonder, but am powerless to write down.<br>  <br>  It's easy to see why some are tempted to crash the gates with LSD or , as is the case with so many successful artists including some close friends, to tempt the Devil by taking heroin.  Admittedly, those that do these things often fall into what could really be called an abyss.  But it's true, too, that in that domain lies a sort of creative consciousness and perception that I can only guess at from my own glimpses. While they access and use the awareness they gain and consistently produce work that is beyond what I can do, and some manage it, my own addictive personality makes it so that such a choice would almost certainly spell disaster.|`|v6CyvHLyaa	My thoughts are shallow and bodiless.

If you have a teacher or friend who knows about instruments, take them with you to check it out. <br>  <br>  You can look on Craigslist or in the Pennysaver (if your area has one) or in your Local Newspaper listings. Sometimes you will even find people willing to give a piano away if you are willing to pay the expense to move it.(Pianos need to be moved in a special way as to not damage them) If you do find one for free, find out from a local moving company how much it will cost you to move before you consent to taking it. <br>  <br>  It may take some time to find the right one and the right deal, but it will be worth it in the long run.

Marriage helps in this way cause an older couple have each other and their children bring connection in their life.<br>  <br>  This feeling is common really to people of all ages.  Because each of us are different and we will feel outside the group at one time or other in our life. <br>  <br>  The only solution really is to find out what makes you tick.

If you feel good about yourself (self esteem) then there's no reason you should feel insignificant.  Feelings of self worth, or self esteem are influenced and affected strongly by your upbringing - how you were treated by your parents etc. but also by your experiences growing up (friends and experiences at school can also impact hugely).<br>  As an adult, although you may still be affected by experiences from your past regardless, feelings of significance will come from how you live your life.  If you're not having any positive effect on your own life or those of others then you're not going to feel very significant!  If you're doing something worthwhile, then you will!<br>  Deal with your past, so that you can then enjoy the future.|`|5VQUeO7aaa	Your soul rejoices in the experiences you bring it, for presentation to the Creator.  Your role is unique, not totally duplicated by anyone.  That is significant.This big "I" that sees thru this little "me" is the Totality.<br>  <br>  You have other bodies.  For example, if you drop the physical body and leave the physical sphere, you may go to the ethereal plane, wearing your ethereal body.  Eventually you will know your body as a Light Body.  It is not matter; it is Light.  All experiences  of other beings are available to you in the Akhashic records.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	I would imagine insignificant feelings are very common place, we all suffer these. As you suggest, such feelings really hinge on comparisons. <br>  <br>  To family and loved ones, we are important, and the world does revolve around our relationships. <br>  In relation to national and global issues, most of us do play a very insignificant role, how could it be otherwise. <br>  In relation to the universe, the Earth itself seems rather insignificant. <br>  <br>  Yet, thinking about it in another way, as far as we know the Earth is the only life bearing planet, humans are the most influential species, and our minds are the most wonderful thing produced by nature. You therefore are unique in the whole of creation, since you have thoughts that are unique among humans. How can you be insignificant, when  you see the world differently to all others?|`|wxSO48E3aa	I've come to the conclusion that everything is equally significant for now.  <br>  <br>  I'm not more significant than anyone or anything else and nothing and nobody is more significant than me.  <br>  <br>  That doesn't make me feel insignificant but I realise that in the grand scale of things I, like everyone  and everything else will pass unnoticed.<br>  <br>  Yes, people will mourn my and your passing while we're still in peoples living memory but after that no-one will remember us or mourn our passing.  <br>  <br>  Beyond that, in the bigger picture, when the earth ends or humans become an extinct species on earth (which ever happens first) nothing that took place here will be remembered and so will have no influence on anything.<br>  <br>  That's why I've come to the conclusion that all things are equally significant.  Everything is significant for now but none more so than any other.|`|26e9cc23c85b5a7644cb7dc61973ef1caa	Well sometimes i do feel very insignificant. I try to quell this feeling, to the point where, at least i'm significant to me, because i'd become suicidal otherwise haha.<br>  <br>  Anyway, i came up with this verse that kinda puts your question in a nutshell, and will make you think. Imagine like a loved one that's passed away says it to you...<br>  <br>  If I died tomorrow,<br>  instead of yesterday<br>  How much does it mean to you,<br>  that I'm here today?|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	"Time will pass, and we shall go away for ever, and we shall be forgotten, our faces will be forgotten, our voices, and how many there were of us; but our sufferings will pass into joy for those who will live after us, happiness and peace will be established upon earth, and they will remember kindly and bless those who have lived before."__ANTON CHEKHOV|`|X3q2DMdmaa	all good Questions.....................but dont kill yourself theres more to life|`|AA11219693	I do not feel insignificant, or that I will die to no significant effect, instead, I feel that ‘I am indispensable in the grand design of all things, in the world, that nothing could have existed without me being in existence all along, but this does not mean that I am right already, as free to do whatever I like. The same is true for all people that I believe at one point of their lives or the other feels the same. There is a question deeper within your mind: You want to know if it is right to feel this intensely about yourself. You see things from the vantage point of you own self, but then, what you see makes you question the validity of your seeing. You need to know the truth. <br>  <br>  I for instance do not think that my existence alone is a reason good enough for me to go on, to do nothing but to keep living without making efforts to know the truth of my life, to make my life a better life. If I am really indispensable, if I feel that ‘everything revolves around me’, then I better be good. If I cannot make myself disperse into nothingness in consequence, then I must be careful about my choices, as what I do, it then is entirely up to me. I need to understand life, take charge, and use it to the best of my discretion.<br>  <br>  I do no agree that this is a ‘twisted world’. I think there is just too much for us to see, to understand and realise, in comparison with the short while we have to live. I think all people see things in more or less similar way; all people have their common likes and dislike, their sense of right and wrong, their shared values. The differences are all the matters of opinion caused by various vantage points there are in life. A poor man, for instance, would see things differently from the one blessed with good fortune; and all sensible people would see God in their own different ways, to the best of their ability and understanding, however the same might be their religious affiliations.<br>  <br>  An increased degree of self-awareness could make one feel anything between queasy in practical matter of our life, and wonderful. This could become possible for certain people to imaginatively detach themselves from the world as an observer; this is possible for any one to feel lonesome and uncomfortably important. I think it is our love for each other, for life, the same love we have for ourselves, that brings us all purposefully and sensible together. I think the realisation of our basic needs, common purposes, our shared dreams, hopes and aspirations enable us to see things from each other’s perspective, making us commonly sensible. <br>  <br>  Instead of staying going too far, or living too long without a purpose, within the wonderful and enigmatic and world of our self, we could learn to carve some good practical purposes out the love we all have. We could learn to make life good, a real success, and a happy life. I can assure you that real success looks the same to most people, would make everyone feel just the same.
AA11219693	We are here to ask questions, the best we can, and then learn to be content and happy with the answers the best that we could get, and this I think is the beginning, and the end of life. For it seems that we are here to ask questions for which there are apparently no definite answers, there is no best answer already I place, but the one from the rest, as in comparison you would chose the one for your question. There then is no good or bad, right or wrong, best of worst already in existence, aside the existence of human beings. <br>  <br>  We are here to make both good and bad happen in the world, and then prove that good overcomes bad, that right prevails over wrong, and love over hatred. This is what we seek to do and see in life, as we are alive. And what lies beyond life, we have no way of knowing, but from the very facts of the life we have, the life we are leading right here and now.<br>  <br>  In this and some deeply philosophical sense I therefore allow myself to think that we have here to achieve the best of ourselves, to shape and form ourselves, into proper human beings. The scale and ultimate limits for our enterprise of life we do not know, as while our bodies reside here in the physical world, our mind suggest us things of the further beyond. <br>  <br>  How far we could go? How good we can become? This is our life what we can make of it? We do not fully know. We just have to keep asking good questions, hoping each time to find the ultimate answer, but in reality each time contenting ourselves with the best so far. In the meantime, however, WE could allow ourselves to succeed in life, the way many other people around us do, and in the consequence be happy just the same.|`|AA11013590	We are here simply because nature created us. We evolved from apes and have become the sentient being on this planet.

N86vHKxtaa	Routing through the Suez canal after it opened in 1869 could save months of travel time when compared to the route around the cape in South Africa.  There was also the issue of weather which is tricky that far south in many seasons of the year.  Transit times would vary a great deal depending on wind and weather for sailing ships.<br>  <br>  The British had a mandate and control of the canal precisely to maintain shorter transit times to India and the Far East.  The term "POSH" which today means upscale or well-to-do, originated as a way to identify the best staterooms on ships transiting the canal to and from India.  Port out and starboard home (posh) put your stateroom on the side facing the best winds  to keep you cool in the desert heat while you transited Suez.|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	Most ships would definitely have used the Suez Canal after it opened - the route was much faster and avoided the frequently dangerous seas of the far south.

W1h3w5gdaa	Honestly the best advice I can give is to go out and find yourself a good instructor (and that doesn't always mean expensive private lessons; keep reading.) I've been teaching for several years and have had hundreds of students. Most of them came to lessons after failing to learn by trying to use books and video systems sold over the Internet.<br>  <br>  It's not that books and systems are inherently bad, it's that most of them are designed to sell you the next lesson in the series. (e.g., they'll teach you the minor pentatonic scale, but you have to buy book 2 to learn the "major" pentatonic scale. They fail to mention that it's the same scale, just moved three frets.)<br>  <br>  Also, these systems are "static" meaning you only learn what is presented to you in the order it was presented. It's missing the most important fundamental of any teaching method; the ability to ask questions!<br>  <br>  Decide what your goal is with guitar, then go find a teacher who will take you there. I prefer instructors that are trained and certified by a network using a specific method, but with enough flexibility to take you in whatever direction you need to go. But I'm biased, because I happen to BE such an instructor, and I wouldn't teach the way I do if I didn't think it was the best way.<br>  <br>  I'll put a link in the source field and you can check out my network's website which has a list of instructors. Some of us give private lessons via e-mail.<br>  <br>  Now, as for beginning tips, I'll tell you this:<br>  <br>  1) Learn a basic finger exercise and practice it for five minutes, really really slowly, every day.<br>  <br>  2) Learn a basic melody, like Mary Had a Little Lamb and play it until it flows naturally.<br>  <br>  3) Learn the following chords: C - A - G - E - D - Am - Dm - Em and memorize how to play them. Practice changing between chords very slowly without losing your rhythm. All guitar chords are based off these eight positions.<br>  <br>  4) Mute your strings and strum along with a lot of different songs. (Muting is just touching all the strings lightly with your left (fret) hand so that when you strum, instead of notes you get a percussive beat sound.)<br>  <br>  5) Learn the C-major scale in open position. (Click the Ultimate Guitar link below and play JUST the first measure. Ignore everything else.) Use your 3rd finger for notes in fret 3, 2nd finger for fret 2, and 1st finger for fret 1. Memorize it and play it all the time. Then figure out how to play it elsewhere on the fretboard.<br>  <br>  6) Learn to play 8-bar and 12-bar blues with a straight beat and a shuffle beat. All rock music (and by extension, most pop music) has its roots in the blues. Understanding this will help you understand a great deal more.<br>  <br>  That should get you started, but you should really get a professional teacher. Check with your local YMCA and if they don't have a guitar program, have them contact the YMCA of Central Kentucky. (Link below.) They have the most successful YMCA Guitar Program in the United States, including sponsorship from Gibson, and should be able to help them get started.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy rockin!!|`|0AUPrCMZaa	best way to learn is a teacher.<br>  <br>  there are the chords in the first position which you usually learn first, easiest songs are relative to the player.<br>  <br>  useful site:  www.guitartricks.com<br>  <br>  you really should consider lessons, if you can't i guess you can grab a book - checkout guitarcenter|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	I would google this:   Free Guitar Chord charts

We shall have to beat him off by whatever weapons we can get hold of - by assassination, poison."<br>  <br>  Of Gallipoli, wartime leader Churchill told Blunt: "God... is bent on the destruction of mankind... That is why he would not let me take Constantinople."<br>  <br>  The diaries, kept in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, show Churchill fiddled his petrol rations. Blunt wrote that he "chuckled over his abuse of Ministerial privilege of using petrol".<br>  <br>  Churchill hated Germany and was part of a left wing government that declared war on it on September 3rd 1939.He failed to see there was a threat from Russia and led us into a war that aided Stalin who was far worse at the time & as its turned out a far worse power to have to face since (Cold War) and in present times.<br>  In the Western world Churchill is held up as a great man but he simply aided Russia to win WWII and in instigating WWII he cost millions of lives.Things would have turned out very diferently if we in Britain had kept nutural.Churchill was a disaster for Europe.He was a war-monger.In the 1920's and 1930's he promoted himself as a seer and his left-wing politics prevailed under pressure from a rise of the right in Germany and what was perceved as a threat to Britain.<br>  We were not threatened if we kept out of Germanys affairs.Germany had a right-wing dictator who's main desire was in the East.<br>  Churchill is respected as Britains greatest according to the BBC.A seer and a prophet and visionary.He saw the threat from Germany coming and made sure it would be directed against Britain & the West<br>  Back in the 1930's he campaigned against Germany as he saw it as a right-wing dictatorship that was evil and would want to rule the world.<br>  A simplistic notion of world politics and one that would lead to confrontation with Germany.<br>  Churchill hated German politics of the time.He must have known a little of Russian politics but did NOTHING to persuade people from the left.Britain became a left-wing country and fought against all right-wing politics and this led to war.It was actually a close call with Chamberlain's Cabinet(including Churchill)voting FOR war with Germany<br>  We (Britain)convinced France to declare war on Germany in September 1939.We did nothing to try and avert war during the EIGHT months of the 'Phoney War'(Sept 1939-April 1940) even though Russia had shown its colours on 17th Sept 1939 and attacked/invaded Poland,Bessarabia,Finland,Lith... & Estonia.<br>  Millions of people died from these countries and they lost their freedom for 50 years until 1989.<br>  Churchilll was myopic in seeing Germany as a threat and opposing him with total war.<br>  He and his government convinced British people our sworn enemy was Germany.<br>  We fell for it<br>  The media was less powerful then and anyway was left-wing too.<br>  We bombed Germany killing hundreds of thousands on both sides and destroying beautiful ancient Cities.<br>  Italy saw therir chance and entered the war.<br>  Japan saw that the time was ripe for them to aquire our Empire in the Far East and thought America would not have the stomach to fight.<br>  <br>  All could have been very different but for Churchill & his persuasive left-wing path to events.<br>  The world would have been a better place without the toad|`|4FWrRRF2aa	Forget the rubbish that has been posted.<br>  <br>  Churchill had the same attitude about Germany as every Briton had.<br>  <br>  Germany was the aggressor nation in WW1, a military tyranny under<br>  <br>  Kaiser Bil. Germany had to be beaten and was.|`|nfUomw3caa	Winston Churchill was prominently involved in both World War I and World War II. Churchill filled several prominent positions during World War I including Minister of Munitions and First Lord of the Admiralty.<br>  <br>  He had several. When the war started he was First Lord of the Admiralty, which meant he was in charge of the navy and everything it did. He was removed from that post after the Gallipoli disaster. He then joined the army and commanded a battalion on the Western Front. Then, after a change in Government, he became Minister of Munitions for the rest of the war.|`|Lw5LaIriaa	He was amazing during the war but when the war was over he was kicked out xD Churchill thought that the war was going to be like in 1066 when William the Conquerer took over England. He thought that we would be fighting fist to fist on the beach like in 1066 but because of the technology advance, we fought with planes and guns, rather than horses and swords.|`|jveO8SONaa	I think his attitude stunk otherwise he would have sided with him in WWII and not made the mistake of opposing him.
79YQAbSRaa	The basic foundation of Christian belief is that Jesus Christ is the son of God and not a mortal man.  He was supposedly crucified, died, and was buried in a tomb.  He supposedly rose from the dead 3 days later (which Christians celebrate as Easter).  Those are the only basic religious beliefs you should be familiar with before reading the DaVinci Code.<br>  <br>  As far as the actualy historical events or geographical locations, some say that Dan Brown took a large bit of dramatic license in writing the book.  For that reason, I would try to enjoy that aspect of the book as pure fiction and not historical fact.<br>  <br>  He got most of the premise for the novel from a book entitled Holy Blood Holy Grail which is also a pretty good read if you're interested.  The authors are Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh.|`|sRw9oiQdaa	You don't need to know anything before you read it.  Everything that comes up is explained to the degree required to understand it.

Also, Google Opus Dei and some summaries of The Bible.  Without an understanding of Christ and his life, prophecies and apostles, it's hard to understand what's going on.<br>  <br>  Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, His birth is just celebrated on that day.  And regardless of what the book discusses, I don't believe he had an illegitimate child with Mary Madelene.|`|AA11624606	I don't think that you need to know very much.

AA12343309	One thing, darker genes are dominant and  it doesn't matter which parent has the darker genes, mother or father.<br>  <br>  Most of your DNA is Autosomal which you get 50-50 from both parents.  It is the DNA that determines your appearance.  You get 23 chromosomes each from both parents. One each determines your sex and they are the two that have your Y & Mitochondrial.<br>  <br>  The other 22 each are made up of your Autosomal.<br>  <br>  One thing your parents have recessive genes that will not show up in their appearance but can in yours.<br>  <br>  Although you get your Autosomal 50-50 from both parents, it is ;not a 25-25-25-25 breakdown from your grandparents.  You get 50% from your paternal grandparents and 50% from your maternal grandparents, but it isn't even steven between grandmother and grandfather whether on the paternal or the maternal side. This will vary in you and will vary in your siblings.  The recessive genes and the variation in DNA received from all your ancestors means that none of you might look exactly alike.<br>  <br>  Too many people look at pigmentation and perhaps height in determining whether someone looks like another.  Definitely your father's darker genes probably will dominate over your mother's lighter genes but if people would look closely at you and your mother, they will see similarities. This will increase as you age.  <br>  <br>  A lot of people don't think my younger sister and I look alike at all. She topped off at 5 ft 2 inches and I topped of at 5 ft6-1/4in.  She is brown eyed and tans very well.  I have a skin cancer type pigmentation, born with red hair, blue eyes and only freckle and burn. Still we both have the same facial shape.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	It's not a matter of ethnicity.  It's that we sometimes look more like or our coloring is more like one parent than the other parent.  I happen to also be part Polish but my other half is Ukranian.  My mother is of Ukranian heritage, born in Poland, and has brown hair & brown eyes, and I have a brother who has her features.  My father is of Polish heritage with blond hair/blue eyes, and my sister and myself look like him.  As someone above has said, your question is more about genetics.|`|eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Brown eyes are a dominant trait while grey, green, hazel, and blue eyes are a recessive trait.  Black hair is also a dominant trait while blonde, light brown, and red hair is a recessive trait.  Knowing that you have inherited these dominant traits, however, doesn't mean a brother or sister might have inherited recessive traits, such as blonde hair and blue eyes, because Mother Nature works in mysterious ways.  <br>  <br>  Statistically, however, whenever parents with different physical traits mate, their children ordinarily inherit the dominant traits.  It matters not whether your parents were Polish and Persian or Portuguese and Pakistani.  Of course, there's no one look for all Poles or all Iranians.<br>  <br>  As for your hair, wait awhile; then, you can use "Just for Men" to cover up the grey.|`|ZxYxB9jCaa	Well, if your parent with the Polish ethnicity has blonde hair, blue eyes, and a light skin color, while your parent with the Persian ethnicity has black/brown hair, black/brown eyes, and olive skin, then you are more likely to have the darker colors, since those genes are stronger.  However, not all Persians have dark features, and not all Polish have light features...it depends.  For instance, my mother’s natural hair color was golden blonde...my mother's cousins have blonde hair and blue eyes...some of my cousins have black hair and black eyes...<br>  <br>  ...about the possibility of your eye/hair color changing...I used to have a very dark brown hair color and dark brown eye color, up until the middle of high school...that is when my hair color changed into this brown color, and it has so many natural caramel like highlights in it, when before it just used to be a single dark brown...my eye color also began to change, but not permanently...some days my eyes look like a golden olive green, while other days they look hazel, and other days they look brown.  It all really depends, and not everyone in your family may be the same. For instance, my sister's hair color changed as well, but her eye color is still a dark (nearly black) brown.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|9Gsx32Skaa	I'm not sure why it is, but like some other people said, the darker features tend to take over the lighter ones. My husband is Persian with the same features as you, and I am American with lighter hair and blue eyes. Our son looks just like his dad. He has dark curly hair (mine is straight) but has green eyes with a little bit of brown(husband has dark brown). Must be something in the genetic make up. I will be watching this question to see what the other people have to say.|`|zDBGLp3vaa	This is the genealogy forum.  Your question is about genetics, not genealogy.  They are not the same thing.  You would get better responses if you re-post this in the biology section, which IS related to genetics.  (Genetics is a science.  Genealogy is history).|`|xux3Y3cnaa	I am betting that it is your father who is Persian.  I have noticed before that many mixed race children look more like the father than the mother.    For instance, when the father is white and the mother is black, the children have lighter skin and brown hair.  My theory is that this is so that the father will know that the child is his because of the physical resemblance (the mother already knows the child is hers through giving birth).  Of course this is only my theory as I don't have enough data.|`|XTmiI44laa	"Is there any chance of my eyes changing color or my hair possibly?<br>  "<br>  <br>  Of course not, but you can get your hair dyed or bleached and get contacts for your eyes in any color you want|`|35191155cc98b21944bbeb0948940f41aa	The polish side would have some dark skin as well.

sRw9oiQdaa	There are too main issues - one with Hanna's illiteracy, but the other with the idea of doing right even when it could mean you will not survive.  Hanna is more ashamed of her inability to read than the fact that the women that she has read to her will be killed.  She doesn't do anything but follow orders despite the 'friendships' she may have formed as they read to her.  She allows evil to happen, and claims that she had no choice.  Did she?  That is the conflict.

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I'm a teenager, and I hate Twilight. Here's why:<br>  <br>  First, I'll comment on the series. All of the books are poorly written. The characters and plot lack depth, the story lacks themes and symbolism (the cover doesn't count) and any hint of other literary devices, and the plot is very messy; a result of not planning the series out.<br>  <br>  The characters. Edward and Bella are uninteresting without each other. They have no real personality. They're both very bland, and though they make the occasional witty remark, the book is filled with nothing but Edward and Bella staring at each other. Bella will say she loves him and that she's not afraid of him. He'll answer that he's not right for her, that they shouldn't be together because he's dangerous, but say that he loves her and he'll be with her, anyway. That's the dialogue between the two main characters for the entire length of the book.<br>  <br>  On top of this, Edward is controlling, manipulative, and stalkerish. In short, borderline abusive. He watches Bella sleep at night, standing in a corner of her room. Watching someone sleep while in bed with them is completely different- *that* is romantic. Not standing in a corner. He follows her to Port Angeles without her knowledge. That's weird. He never lets Bella make her own decisions. She doesn't want to go to prom, but he takes her, anyway. She wants to see Jacob, he disables her car so that she can't. She doesn't want to go to college, but he forces her into filling out applications. It's true that he was trying to have her do the right thing and everything, but he needs to respect her decisions. If she wants to go to college, she'll fill out applications on her own. If she doesn't want to go to prom, she doesn't want to go. And he's manipulative especially in Eclipse. When she tells him she wants to have sex with him, he puts her entire life into a deal. The only way he'll have sex with her is if she marries him, and after that, he'll change her. This site has more information on all of this: <a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/recycle-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/recycle-...</a><br>  <br>  Bella. A flat character who lets Edward walk all over her. A character without morals. She lies to Charlie about where she's going and who she'll be with so that she can be with Edward. (And how does Charlie not notice this, but he's the Police Chief? Plot hole number 1, ladies and gentlemen.) She ignores everyone human because they're simply not good enough for her. They're not supercool vampires. They don't make her happy. She goes into this huge depression after Edward leaves for months and months. What does this say to high schoolers? That if your boyfriend breaks up with you, it's the end of the world?<br>  <br>  The plot. The practically nonexistant plot. In Twilight, any sign of an actual plot comes about 3/4 of the way through the novel. It's absolutely fine to have romance as a plot, but nothing happened at all, besides Edward and Bella fighting each other over whether Bella could be turned or whether the relationship is right, etc. etc. etc. But the plot is slapped on at the end, the ballet thing, as if Meyer realized at the last second that she actually needed a plot. And that was when she introduced James, Laurent, and Victoria. <br>  <br>  In New Moon, she sulks for about five months after Edward leaves. And after those five months, she spends time with Jacob (again, not her human friends) and kind of sort of gets over the pain. And then, once again, there is a plot slapped on at the end, and this is the whole "let's save Edward" thing. (And can I just point out that she, once again, leaves home -and the continent- without telling Charlie what's going on? She lies to him.)<br>  <br>  Eclipse. This has more of a plot. The triangle between Jacob, Edward, and Bella. You need a theme? The problem with themes in this series is that anything with potential is just cancelled out somewhere else in the series. But I'll try. A theme consists of a topic and the message. The topic could be "friendship" or "love." Personally, I think the only theme that doesn't cancel out is "love is friendship." This would apply to Jacob, because they were friends in New Moon before they fell in love. Edward, she was never friends with. Love at first sight, remember? And a moral. See, here's where you have a real problem. I shouldn't have to explain much, because I've already gone over how immoral Bella and Edward are. I guess, again pertaining to Jacob because he is the most realistic character, it could be "peristence is the answer." He wouldn't give up on Bella.<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn. Not only is BD not well written, it's just completely absurd. Meyer broke many of her own rules in order to give the characters their happy ending. Imprinting is rare, but everyone ends up imprinting. The Volturi are supposed to be fierce and power-hungry, but they leave Edward, Bella, and Renesmee as if they were old friends and maybe they'd catch up later, sometime. Aro tore Caius from his lover in order to keep him in the Volturi. But he does nothing to the Cullens? That's hard to believe. And then there's Bella's actual pregnancy. How is that possible? We're never given a reason, Meyer just tells us (last second, once again) that it's happened, before. And even if she could give us a good reason, why didn't Carlisle, the best doctor you could find anywhere, or Edward, a hundred-year-old genius, think that Edward could inject venom into Bella's body while having sex? Venom is the only fluid in the vampire's body. So how could it not get inside Bella and turn her? There was no thought put into this. And lastly, why does everyone get a happy ending when nobody deserved it? Not that they're all bad people, it's just that it's not realistic. Especially for Jacob, who was the doomed character from the very beginning. He lost the girl he loved, but imprinted on her daughter? Not only is that sick, it's just so stupid a thing to do to a character. I know Meyer wanted her characters to be happy and everything, but an emotional attachment to your characters which is that strong is extremely hazardous to the wellfare of your own story. These are only the main problems with BD. Believe me, there were more.<br>  <br>  But I like that the vampires are not conventional. I feel like people are picking at them too much. So what if they sparkle and aren't as seductive as they're "supposed" to be? Not all elves work for Santa- some live in trees. It's called creative license, people. And I like the general idea of the books. It's just that, for all of the reasons above, Stephenie Meyer wasn't quite able to pull it off.|`|YxEwDCquaa	I really like the plot and the way Edward is so understanding. Too understanding if you ask me, it ended up irritating me how Bella constantly went on about Jacob even though she constantly said that she knew who she couldn't live without, which was Edward. It's also weirdly realistic (not the whole vampire thing) but say compared to Harry Potter (which is good aswel) its more real, (secret wizard schools, broomsticks) Its not what you would expect with vampires. I just really like the story of what happens.<br>  <br>  I hate it that all the 'emo's are getting all mad about it because it's for everyone not just them.<br>  <br>  And i hate it how people saw the film (which was a letdown) and diss it and dont bother to read the book because 'it cant be any better than the film'|`|5wg7tKc6aa	I'm 17, and I think Twilight was a decent read a year ago, but as soon as it got all hyped up around March, I couldn't stand the idea of it... and I lost all excitement for Breaking Dawn... my interest in it wore off almost immediately.  For example, I'll read another book, and I'll be in awe for a week, and then forget about it within a month.<br>  <br>  However, this does not apply to a certain...

"books" not the movie so much. <br>  <br>  i like how the books are written, me personally are into books that are romantic and sort of a mystery. it wasnt a big mystery, but i was always excited to see what was to come of the next chapter or page after a big part! <br>  <br>  i would have to say it does have some corny parts but what book is absolutely perfect? none right? yeah well, im not a big reader but something about these books just caught my attention. <br>  <br>  i started reading twilight and it took me like a week to get through... i wasnt really into it at first, but one i got past the slow part i couldnt stop reading it!  i finished new moon, eclipse and breaking dawn within three days ! (not each one seperately, but all together) i couldnt put them down. when i had free time i would read it. <br>  <br>  i love how easy it is to put yourself in there place, it seems so realistic. the tension and the love in it is just gripping, i think that they are well written and layed out very well. <br>  <br>  i would of never expected "that" to happen to bella at the end. the last book someone told me, i couldnt wait to read it. my mom hadnt bought it yet, but even when i knew what happend... it didnt happen the same as what i expected, which made it even better. i guess the frist 3 books were so good that i had to finish reading it and i did. and i absolutely love them. i still read them (series over agian) <br>  <br>  yeah, so thats only part of why i like twilight! =)|`|wKSvnna2aa	The fact that it's not well-written and interesting enough compared to other books I have read, such as Jane Eyre, Lord of the Rings, etc., and how clumsily Meyer handled the plot and character development, really disappointed me.<br>  <br>  (I was 16 when I first read it.)|`|AcnpYMtqaa	I pretty much liked the whole series except for the many times she repeated words such as chagrin and marble and glorious the list can go on and on.<br>  <br>  I also didnt like the interuption of the Jacob "book" in Breaking Dawn <br>  Other then that I Loved it i dont know what it is but the way she describes each and every character and the fact that she gives you the feeling that your in the book sitting in Bellas room or at the fight scenes or wherever the story is set you can see it in your mind.<br>  <br>  Im 13 and watched the movie before the book but agree books are better.

She's a talented writer for not doing it for a living. <br>  Things I don't like...that every preteen girl under the sun is obsessed with it and make the rest of us look bad. I want to be able to like something and not get ridiculed for it, and they make it really difficult.

From that, I have a few paragraphs that relate to why Bella is annoying.<br>  <br>  "On top of this, Edward is controlling, manipulative, and stalkerish. In short, borderline abusive. He watches Bella sleep at night, standing in a corner of her room. Watching someone sleep while in bed with them is completely different- *that* is romantic. Not standing in a corner. He follows her to Port Angeles without her knowledge. That's weird. He never lets Bella make her own decisions. She doesn't want to go to prom, but he takes her, anyway.

I can't think of one good thing about her. Hope this helps.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	She's a Mary Sue. An empty, cardboard cutout of a character that exists for no other reason than to either insert the author into the story, or for readers to step into the character. That's part of why young girls love this story so much -- whenever they say they can relate to a young, awkward girl who feels plain and unsure of herself, they're really saying they find themselves in the story. Unfortunately, that's a sign of a poorly written character. A good story will draw you in, but not make you part of it.<br>  <br>  She's also very anti-feminist, which I find insulting. Young girls deserve something better than a "protagonist" who constantly swoons over her man and can't imagine living without him. <br>  <br>  And who is she in love with? An obsessed stalker. A 100-year-old vampire who would have no reason to take any interest in a plain, clumsy 17-year-old girl.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know, he's the Glittery Vampire Who Just Wants to Cuddle. This is somehow "hot." But it doesn't make for a good -- or believable -- character.|`|A9nsilNNaa	I find that bella is a character that many girls can relate to and project themselves onto. She is plain, clumsy, and quiet. This makes heer a likable character in the books. She also works hard in school and takes care of her parents.

But then, I got somewhat tired of Edward (and his stalkerish quality) and I realized that Bella is actually pretty....annoying.  She's whiny and needy and just has to have things her way.  Really...it's annoying.  She's stubborn too.  I guess her strengths would have to be....honestly, I really can't think of one.  When I see her, I just see an annoying (sorry for being repetitive) girl.  It's....yeah...<br>  <br>  :)|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	The movie and the books suck.

She lets Edward walk all over her - I'll allow that. She does. Ok, maybe holding your resolve around a stunningly beautiful person who has the sweetest smelling breath which would confuzzle any human's mind and has possesion of your heart is hard. But still. I know that Edward is probably only doing the 'No Sex' thin for her safety and all, but that's not the only thing he denies her, or forces upon her. Arguing with your one true love I suppose isn't the best idea but I think she should have a little dignity. <br>  And the essays upon essays of how she just isn't worthy of such a dreamy god-like creature are pointless. Perhaps a bit should have been slipped in about how she felt inferior beside him but should she really care about that? He obviously loves her and it's not as if she won't be happy just because everyone else is talking about how Edward Cullen is going out with Bella Swan. Oh, wait, but no one seems to mind that apart from all the jealous girls because all the guys think she's gorgeous anyway. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you've got to hand it to her; the girl's got guts. Risking her life almost all the time because her true love could kill her at any moment or one of his quirky family members could do it for him. Then there's the whole outsider threat. Of course, she's not fully awear of these dangers because I quote "You're intoxicated by my very presence." Edward was, as always, right. Which brings me back to the point that Edward walks all over her. Not only that, but she spends half her time day dreaming of him. Most teenage girls do that, I agree. But moaning about how gorgeous he is, how cleaver he is, how unique, godlike, perfect and all the other random words that Meyer has picked from the dictionary is really too much. <br>  <br>  I conclude. Bella does my head in - to make it plain. Twilight would be quite a remarkable book if it wasn't for the constant whining. Oh, well. Perhaps, one day, some one will rewrite the whole saga with a different main character or even from some one elses perspective, although that would cut out how much they're deleriously, crazily and stupidly in love.<br>  <br>  <br>  sdj x

cYgJQDQSaa	Hastings was a close run battle, it was blind luck Harold was killed while rallying his troops on his left flank. Tactically, Harold held a strong position on the forward slope of Senlac hill and his shield wall was holding strong against repeated Norman cavalry charges. The Saxon's however tended to lack the discipline of the Normans and would attempt to pursue retreating Normans following attacks.  Repeatedly it looked as though Harold would carry the day (a rumor went through the Norman ranks that William had been killed- William had to ride up and down the line with his helmet raised to show his face to his troops- if one stray arrow made it's mark...).<br>  <br>  As for a post Stamford bridge alternate history, there would have been a battle between Harald and William, as William's ambition was to gain the crown of England.  As to where that battle would have occurred is problem, would Harald have stayed in the "Danelaw" forcing William to advance north (possibly to face a protracted campaign) or would Harald have swung south to seize London? I suspect possibly the latter would have occurred. Harald would have advanced south and he and William would have met somewhere south of London as the Norman advance was based on building a secure beach head and consolidating any gains. Therefore, the battle would have occurred in the Sussex region possibly near the actual site of Hastings. I'm not sure if Harald would have been successful, his men would have been fresher than Harold's but it still would have been close.  The real power would have been who could have rallied the surviving (not that there would have been many- as in hastings they would have fought to the death- even over the body of their dead king) vanquished Saxon lords to thier side. I suspect it would have been too bitter a pill for them to join Harald and William may have seemed more legitimate a heir.|`|bc7f3e18f5c0ec0964528f9f8771a134aa	His name is Harald Hardrada not Harald the Ruthless!

His army was very tired by the long forced march from Yorkshire to Sussex (300 miles on foot). He would have been able to have more say in the tactics and to have been able to choose the place of battle to his greater advantage. Hastings was a close run thing, and an army fresh to battle, fighting on its home turf would have had a great advantage over the invading Normans.

First of all the levels of them are high in adolescence and not as predictable as in later stages of life. Second (and I think most important), we aren't used to them. <br>  <br>  When I was young I took the emotions and moodswings at face value and treated them as if they were as genuine as those produced from significant things.

People who died on the Titanic had a good 'death' in that they didn't die alone, but with friends and servants,they were 'well fed' in the middle of their living time, no period of 'dying' for them - went from 'life' to 'death' via the anasethetic of the cold water.

ANzszvWRaa	The Blessed Virgin has been depicted in many different ways throughout history - up to the early 13th century she was not dressed in blue for example, but in the clothes of a middle-class woman with no particular colour symbolism.<br>  <br>  She is not always shown holding the Immaculate Heart (this is a fairly modern American idea), but may hold various other symbols including the dove of peace or the Lamb of God. Most often, of course, she holds the Christ child and so is easy to identify.<br>  <br>  All of these symbols originate in the medieval period, where Saints and other Holy figures had to be distinguished by some identifying sign (a lamb for St Agnes, a wounded deer for St Giles and so on). Because of the high level of illiteracy among the population, simply writing the name alongside the image would have been useless - but the symbol meant instant recognition.<br>  <br>  Whether she holds a dove, a lamb or the Heart, she is still Our Lady the Blessed Virgin Mary.|`|QkYzOuPdaa	Mary Queen of Peace|`|2cSdPvv6aa	yes i think Lady or Peace <br>  =]|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	Queen of Heaven.<br>  Or Virgin of Fatima.<br>  Or Lady of the Immaculate Conception <br>  <br>  The dove represents the Holy Spirit.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Our Lady of Peace.<br>  <br>  Nuestros Dame de Las Palomas - Our Lady of the Doves.

5pZFw65Waa	Europe: It all started when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy. Early on they signed a pact of peace. Soon Germany was taken over with anti-Jewish propaganda and media. Hitler was angered at the treaty of versailles (signed after the end of world war 1, it restricted Germany's armed forces and Industry). He believed that Germany should have that land back. So behind the backs of other European countries, Germany began building up their army. Hitler blamed Germany's economical crisis and the treaty of versailles on Poland, France and the Jewish people. In 1939, he decided to attack Poland. The Germans staged an attack from Poland and used it to attack Poland. Poland was easily conquered by the Germans. The war at that point was between Poland and Germany. England became uneasy and supplied France with soldiers. They placed most of their soldiers in the east of France. They expected that Germany would use the same strategy as world war 1. But soon Germany had crushed The Netherlands. And now the Blitzkrieg was in full force through France. England and France declared war on Germany. Within month's Germany pushed out the French politicians (who fled to Africa). Soon Germany attacked Russia, breaking a peace treaty. The Russians quickly retaliated and declared war on Germany. At this point only a few European countries had not sided with the Axis or Allies. Not long after, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and The United States declared war on Japan. In an agreement with Japan, Germany declared war on The US. Soon The United States returned the favor. The Second World War was in full swing.<br>  <br>  Pacific: Before war broke out in Germany, Japan invaded parts of China and other Asian countries. Soon the Dutch, British and Australian Armies declared war on Japan. They fought mostly around the Philippines. Japan had the superior Naval force and took over much of the Philippines and the islands surrounding. In addition to that, they began taking over islands deep into the Pacific island. Drunk from victory, the Japanese believed they could take The United States. After month's of planning, the Japanese launched an air attack against Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. At the news of the attack, President Roosevelt declared war on Japan. And soon the United States would be retaliating.|`|hQWucH5uaa	The cause of World war II?<br>  <br>  That's easy.<br>  <br>  In September of 1939 both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany invaded Poland at the same time, and Great Britain honored her treaty with Poland.

c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	UK answer.<br>  Here in the UK  the stillborn register is not available  to the public on any web site. This is information that only the parents or the stillborn child's siblings  after the death of both parents, are privy to. In the event of the death of both parents then death certificates must be shown for both parents as proof of right to view.

I have found that some counties started recording still births in the late-1800s (the stillbirths of my great-great-grandmother's twins in 1883) but others started much later (no record of the stillbirth of what would have been my aunt or uncle in the 1930s.)|`|AA12329250	You will not find stillbirths in the birth and death indexes, as historically only live births had to be registered.  The Stillbirths Register was started on 1st July 1927 but the indexes are not available to be searched by the public.  To find out more about a stillbirth in 1936 you will have to make a special application to the GRO, but only the parents or, if they are deceased, a direct descendant of the parents will be eligible to be given this information.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	I think it is more3 recent than that the legislation came about to have all still births registered and before that not all were .

She and all the members of the 'Flock' – Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman and Angel – are just like ordinary kids – only they have wings and can fly. It may seem like a dream come true to some, but their lives can morph into a living nightmare at any time – like when Angel, the youngest member of the 'Flock', is kidnapped and taken back to the 'School' where she and the others were genetically engineered by sinister scientists. Her friends brave a journey to blazing hot Death Valley, California, to save Angel, but soon enough, they find themselves in yet another nightmare – this one involving fighting off the half-human, half-wolf 'Erasers' in New York City. Whether in the treetops of Central Park or in the bowels of the Manhattan subway system, Max and her adopted family take the ride of their lives. Along the way Max discovers from her old friend and father-figure Jeb – now her betrayed and greatest enemy – that her purpose is save the world – but can she?<br>  There is romance in this book between Max and Fang. :)<br>  <br>  Also try...<br>   The Hunger Games by Suzanne Colins..<br>  <br>  It's about a girl named Katniss who enters the Hunger Games in the place of her beloved sister Prim. The Hunger Games is an annual event held by the Capitol to keep the 12 other districts in line. One boy and one girl is chosen from every district to battle each other until one person remains and is declared winner. Katniss ends up being an actual contender in the games. She also has an angle. She's is deeply head over heels in love with Peeta the boy pick for the Hunger Games. At first the love is artificial but will it become something more? You watch Katniss struggle internally with her feelings, hunger, doing what's right, missing her family, and staying alive. . I will warn you that the book is sad as well as the ending, but there is a sequel.

Cj88zzMkaa	The American Revolution refers to the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrew the governance of the British Empire and then rejected the British monarchy to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. These states then joined against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also: American War of Independence). This resulted in the independent states uniting to form one nation, breaking away from the empire in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence, rejecting not only the governance of Parliament, but also now the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance. After seven years of war came effective American victory on the battlefield in October 1781, with British recognition of the United States' independence and sovereignty in 1783.<br>  <br>  The American Revolution included a series of broad intellectual and social shifts that occurred in the early American society, such as the new republican ideals that took hold in the American population. In some states, sharp political debates broke out over the role of democracy in government, with a number of even the most liberal Founding Fathers fearing mob rule. Consequently, many issues of national governance were not settled until the Constitution of the United States (1787), including the United States Bill of Rights (1789) comprising its first 10 amendments, replaced the relatively weak Articles of Confederation (see Federalist Papers) that framed the first attempt at a national government. In contrast to the loose confederation, the Constitution enshrined the natural rights idealized by republican revolutionaries, and guaranteed them under a relatively strong federated government, as well as allowing for dramatically expanded suffrage for national elections. The American shift to republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of the traditional social hierarchy, and created the ethic that formed the core of American political values.[1]<br>  <br>  the leaders were Samuel Adams,American Patriot ,Morton John,|`|N86vHKxtaa	If you mean the revolution that created the US, then the principal grievances are outlined in the Declaration of Independence which you can find easily on-line and read.<br>  <br>  The principal leaders of that revolution were also the signers of the Declaration, plus a few other figures like George Washington.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	hmmmm, let's see...<br>  <br>  Thomas Franklin<br>  Benjamin Washingson<br>  Sam Adams<br>  William T. Jackson...|`|ItCOMhYGaa	Major and key players in the American revolution were Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. What led to it was the fact that the 13 colonies were being paying taxes more than the people in britain and were not being represented in the British Parliament. So the 13 colonies got together and said, we pay taxes and our ideas arent being heard. Thus resulting in a revolution.

TU7vDI95aa	A History of Western Art (I have the Revised Fourth Edition) by Laurie Schneider Adams.  Obviously, it's very eurocentric, but I've found that it's a great resource overall.|`|rh5vbol9aa	The meaning of the art by Herbert Read.|`|AA10729271	either find a first year art history textbook (can probably get them second hand on ebay) or choose a specific era, style, artist, culture, that appeals to you and find books on them and then expand from there by studying that era further.
CCf6Y7DIaa	this sounds like the kind of thing where if you can't find a friend to do it, you're going to have to pay someone; drawing a caricature takes quite a bit of skill and time, and most artists don't make much money... i sincerely doubt anyone will be willing to do a stranger such a huge favor pro bono.<br>  <br>  you could try making your request at forums for graphic artists and see if any of the residents is willing to take up the challenge (if it doesn't get you outright banned). another option is to go to a less formal picture forum with an 'oekaki' or painter application where there may be graphic artists hungry and eager for something interesting to draw. -obviously, you shouldn't be shocked if you receive something that isn't quite what you're looking for since these are unpaid strangers.
6QLUmax0aa	I think that a combination of both would be a very good way to start. You can take one private lesson to learn the correct posture and left hand positions, and then switch to online lessons to save a significant amount of money and time. If you have a bit of self-discipline, you can actually get more from online lessons. You can then go on with online lessons and have some private tuition say once a month or every two months to sharpen the edges and clarify anything you don't fully understand.<br>  <br>  Let's make a small calculation and try to figure out some points:<br>  Normally, you would take one lesson a week if you want to see any kind of result in say 6-12 months. Let's assume that one hour of guitar lessons costs $40 (which can actually be higher). So, it would make $160 a month and $960 for six months. This is actually an awful lot of money to spend. Instead of this, you can go on with online resources - and there are some very decent resources that can provide value with a very small investment in terms of money- and have one lesson a month which sums up to only $240 in 6 months. You can find below an article I've found that can help you get in the right direction. Hope this helps you a bit.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	the best instruction would be to find an instructor :p<br>  <br>  try craigslist, you would be surprised how many people advertise their services.  I found my piano teacher that way.<br>  <br>  you get first hand experience and knowledge, someone to show you what you are doing wrong and to keep you on track.  to keep you on the ball and pushing you forward.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: what the hell is it with craigs list that people always give me thumbs down??  it worked for me.  jeez.|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	Shortcuts and any questions you have can be answered right then and there.|`|4fApolv3aa	Taking guitar lessons offline or online have both their pros and cons. It really depends on what kind of students you are. There are persons who do good if they study by themselves and there are those who learn faster if they deal with actual coaches. But my personal recommendation is to get the most out of both. It will be good if you learn and read beginner lessons available online, start feeling your guitar as you learn, it's actually surprising how some online resources are very detailed that you already learn how to play the basics without knowing it. At that moment, you can choose to find a coach and your lessons will be easier, easier for the coach to teach you, and easier for you to learn because you are not new with the lessons already.|`|z9rsJkTwaa	It depends on your personality and style of learning.  Some people learn well from videos and books or just have a natural inclination to play the guitar with the proper technique.  Some people might remember things quickly and accurately.  These types of people may not benefit as much from classes or lessons.<br>  <br>  A teacher can help guide a student toward material that is a suitable challenge for them.  He or she can correct technical problems when necessary.  A teacher can also quickly answer your questions.  I think it would be very difficult to have a good understanding of music theory (Jazz or Classical) without an instructor or without discussing the topic with knowledgeable people.<br>  <br>  I learned to play guitar with the guidance of a teacher, and I learned alto saxophone without.  It probably took me twice as long to learn the saxophone than it would have if I had an instructor.  The benefit for learning without a teacher was that I saved thousands of dollars $$$.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to sign up for lessons in a classroom environment, and it costs nothing, then it might be worth it.  It is hard for a teacher to guide a large class of music students, but there is plenty to gain in that environment.  If you are looking to take private lessons, keep in mind that it can be difficult to find a teacher who will take you in the direction that you want to go.  It's not a bad idea to try a few teachers out and then make a decision based on your experiences.

DiRI58buaa	Happiness: Pleasure minus Pain; bigger this number, happier you are<br>  Utility: Amount of Pleasure minus Pain for everyone affected by action.<br>  Higher: Intellectual Pleasures<br>  Lower: "Animal" pleasures- ie sex, food, and drink<br>  <br>  Mill is one of the defenders of classical Utilitarianism.  He is also a hedonist of a special stripe.  As a hedonist, he believes happiness is having a life with lots of pleasure and little pain.  So the value of a life is an equation of Pleasure minus Pain.  As a utilitarian, an act is morally right if and only if it MAXIMIZES the pleasure minus pain contained in the world, for everyone.<br>  What Mill did was make a distinction between higher and lower pleasures.  He did this because people were calling hedonism the philosophy of swine!  So by saying that higher pleasures (intellectual) "count" more than lower (animal) pleasures Mill was trying to defend against the swine objection.

OhWmu0R3aa	In terms of English monarchs, he was probably a little more popular in France than others up to that point; but this was purely based on his marriage to Henrietta Maria, the favourite daughter of Henri IV (one of the most popular French kings), and that she was a catholic. But on the whole most were probably indifferent.<br>  <br>  However, that said, the execution of Charles I in January 1649 sent shockwaves around Europe and a huge upsurge in sympathy for the dead king. His sons, the future Charles II and James II, were cared for at the court of his first cousin, Louis XIV, where the cause for their restoration was championed.|`|dO2VE9Vuaa	Charles the First of France is also called Charlemagne. He was very respected during his time.<br>  Charles the First of England was married to a French Royal Princess Henrietta Marie.After Charles's execution his family sought refuge with the French who supported them for the entire time of the Commonwealth of England's existence|`|zXtOCZIraa	The second son of James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born at Fife in Scotland on 19 November 1600. His father succeeded Queen Elizabeth I and came to the throne of England as King James I in 1603. Charles was created Duke of Albany at his baptism (December 1600) and Duke of York in 1605. He was placed in the care of Lord and Lady Fyvie until the age of four, then moved to England where he was brought up in the household of Sir Robert and Lady Carey. As a child, Charles suffered from weak ankle joints (probably the result of rickets) which slowed his physical development. He was also slow in learning to speak. He outgrew these defects, except for a slight stammer which he never overcame. His education was overseen by Thomas Murray, a Scottish Presbyterian who later became Provost of Eton. Charles was a serious student who excelled at languages, rhetoric and divinity. <br>  <br>  Charles was overshadowed by his brilliant elder brother Prince Henry, to whom he was devoted, but Henry died when Charles was 12 years old. Charles and his sister Elizabeth mourned Henry together, which created a bond between them that affected English foreign policy after Elizabeth married the Elector of the Palatinate. Henry's death made Charles heir to the throne of the Three Kingdoms: England, Scotland and Ireland. By strength of will, he overcame his physical weaknesses to become a good horseman and huntsman. He developed sophisticated tastes in the arts and earnestly applied himself to his religious devotions. Created Prince of Wales in 1616, he was instructed by King James in every aspect of ruling a kingdom. With a profound belief that Kings were appointed by God to rule by Divine Right, Charles succeeded as the second Stuart King in 1625. <br>  <br>  Charles came to the throne amid pressure from English Protestants for intervention against Spain and the Catholic powers in the religious wars raging in Europe (the Thirty Years War, 1618-48). He allowed England's foreign policy to be directed by the unpopular Duke of Buckingham, who launched a series of disastrous military expeditions against Spain and France with the aim of indirectly assisting the Palatinate. Charles dissolved his first two Parliaments when they attempted to impeach Buckingham but he was forced to call a third because he needed funds to pursue his warlike policies. In 1628, Charles' opponents formulated the Petition of Right as a defence against the King's arbitrary use of his powers. Charles grudgingly accepted the Petition in the hope that Parliament would grant him subsidies, but in practice he ignored its provisions.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  After the assassination of Buckingham in 1628, critics in Parliament turned their attention to Charles' religious policy. He angrily dismissed his third Parliament in 1629, imprisoned several of his leading opponents, and declared his intention of ruling alone. The eleven-year period of the King's Personal Rule was also described as the "Eleven Year Tyranny". It was initially successful — during the turmoil of the civil wars, many people looked back upon it as a golden age of peace and prosperity. Charles had made peace with Spain and France by 1630. Trade and commerce grew; the King's finances were stable by 1635. This enabled him to commission great works of art by Rubens and Van Dyck, and also to build up the Royal Navy for England's defence. But without Parliament to grant legal taxes, Charles was obliged to raise income by obscure and highly unpopular means including forced loans, the sale of commercial monopolies and, most notoriously of all, ship-money. Along with Charles' controversial religious policies, these measures alienated many natural supporters of the Crown, including powerful noblemen like Lord Saye and Sele, and wealthy landowners like John Hampden.<br>  <br>  Charles and his advisers made extensive use of the Court of Star Chamber to prosecute opponents. Dating back to the 15th century, Star Chamber had originally been a court of appeal. Under the Stuarts, it came to be used to examine cases of sedition, which in practice meant that the court could be used to suppress opposition to royal policies. Star Chamber sessions were held in secret, with no indictments, no right of appeal, no juries, and no witnesses. It became synonymous with the King's misuse of his power during the Personal Rule.<br>  <br>  In religion, Charles favoured the elaborate and ritualistic High Anglican form of worship. He appointed William Laud Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633. Laud insisted upon strict compliance to the established tenets of the Church and vigorously supported the King's Divine Right. Laud also made extensive use of Star Chamber and the ecclesiastical Court of High Commisson to suppress opposition from Puritans who regarded the High Church Laudian liturgy as dangerously close to Roman Catholicism.

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I'v never read it before but I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too|`|oE1eCjRtaa	It doesn't follow the same path as stephenie meyer's but. If your looking for books containing, romance, Fantasy and adventure, then i would try the black magicians trilogy by Trudi Canavan or The Circle of the gods trilogy also by Trudi canavan.<br>  <br>  I would suggest The "Circle trilogy" by Nora Roberts as that also contains romance fantasy and adventure. it contains a vampire falling in love with a human as well, but you have to read them all to understand it.<br>  <br>  A last author i would recommend is Fiona McIntosh. her books are fab and contain everything any one would ever need, they are how ever probably best to read if you are over 16.|`|ZfWUK5x3aa	I don't know if you've read Harry Potter, but seriously, I adore that series. <br>  <br>  You should read the Shopaholic series if you haven't.

He wrote Wicked. It's the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view and how she grew up and stuff. Really sheds a new light on Dorothy. One of my favorite trilogies is by Liba Brey. She wrote A Great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, and A Sweet and Far Thing. These books were really fantastic. Romance, adventure, fantasy-all in one.

Heinrich Schliemann (1822-1890), who excavated Troy and Mycenae, was notorious in his own time for taking liberties with scientific method in order to prove pet theories and line his own pockets. David Traill, drawing on a trove of unpublished sources, tries a little too hard to paint Schliemann as a deviant--he was not the worst of his kind by a long shot--but he offers a rich account of how archaeology was once done, and of how history is made.
vhlORK4Waa	ADJOINING Northfleet, north-eastward, lies the town and parish of GRAVESEND, having the river Thames for its northern boundary.<br>  <br>  A common misconception is that the name has anything to do with graves - it doesn't.<br>  <br>  You can often read that during the Great Fire of London (1666) there were many deaths in London but not enough time to bury all of the bodies so the bodies were thrown into the Thames and supposedly ended up being washed ashore downstream at Gravesend...apart from the logical observation that many bodies would have come ashore a great deal sooner than Gravesend, is the fact that Gravesend existed in 1268 as a Market License for "Gravesend and Milton" exists from that time. Another issue is that Samuel Pepys, diarist and witness to the Great Fire, records visiting Gravesend in 1650 - 16 years before the fire. <br>  <br>  The historically researched reason is that  it is called in Domesday, GRAVESHAM, and in the Textus Roffensis, GRAVES?NDE. <br>  <br>  Lambarde, as well as Leland, derive the name of this place from the Saxon word Gerefa, a ruler, or portreve. In German, Greve; hence Gravesend signifies the limit or bound of such a rule or office, in Latin, Limes Pr?torius. Leland, in his Itinerary, calls it GREVA.<br>  <br>  THE PARISH OF GRAVESEND lies on the north side of the London road, which runs along the southern side of it at the distance of about one mile from the town, which is situated twenty-two miles from London and eight from Rochester<br>  <br>  Hope this helps clear up your question?!<br>  <br>  Halcon :-))|`|WaI693jHaa	Lots of theories but no definite answer.

They felt that Gandhi was sacrificing Hindu interests in an effort to appease minority groups. They blamed Gandhi for the Partition of India, which left hundreds of thousands of people dead.<br>  <br>  At Godse's trial it became obvious that he was mentally unbalanced and had been hugely manipulated by others. Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as Gandhi's two sons, felt that he and the others on trial for the murder were pawns of RSS higher-ups.<br>  Following the trial and Godse's execution the RSS, was temporarily banned. However, later investigators could find no evidence that the RSS bureaucracy had formally sponsored or even knew of Godse's plot.

AA10017460	My dearest lord and father, loving mother, and family, <br>  O, pardon me for bringing ill news, but when thou dost know the cause of the result, thou shalt be glad I have sent thee this note. <br>  From the beginning shall I start this rueful tale of love and woe. My lover, and since three days past, my wife, hath been Juliet, the one and only daughter of Lord Capulet, whom I know thou detests. Ay, but love cannot be controlled! To me, she is life, earth, and heaven itself, and without her, I would to my grave, to accompany her in her eternal sleep. <br>  After learning my angel’s eyes have closed forever through grief of our parting, the only decision left for me to make is to stay with her forever. Whether we thrive in heaven, or even burn in hell, I care not; I care only for Juliet. To her grave I go, and together we shall lie in the sleep of the dead. <br>  War of our families has led to both our deaths. Love cannot be forced or withdrawn; forbidden love even more so. Fight no more, father; let my death be the sacrifice made for peace. O, I pray that with the death of Juliet and I, love may spring forth, and consume both our families in reconciliation. May peace be with you. <br>  Romeo
pI5jKfmaaa	Moral dualism is the belief of the great balance (in eastern and naturalistic religions) or conflict (in western religions) between the "benevolent" and the "malignant". Most religious systems have some form of moral dualism - in western religions, for instance, a conflict between good and evil.<br>  <br>  During the classical era of Buddhist philosophy in India, philosophers such as Dharmakirti argue for a dualism between states of consciousness and Buddhist atoms (the basic building blocks that make up reality), according to "the standard interpretation" of Dharmakirti's Buddhist metaphysics.[1] Typically in Western philosophy, dualism is considered to be a dualism between mind (nonphysical) and brain (physical), which ultimately involves mind interacting with the physical brain, and therefore also interacting with the micro-particles (basic building blocks) that make up the brain tissue. Buddhist dualism, in Dharmakirti’s sense, is different in that it is not a dualism between the mind and brain, but rather between states of consciousness (nonphysical) and basic building blocks (according to the Buddhist atomism of Dharmakirti, Buddhist atoms are also nonphysical: they are unstructured points of energy). Like so many Buddhists from 600-1000 CE, Dharmakirti’s philosophy involved mereological nihilism, meaning that other than states of consciousness, the only things that exist are momentary quantum particles, much like the particles of quantum physics (quarks, electrons, etc.).|`|u33x2hqzaa	World Citizen said it best.  I would add that in terms of applying dualism to your life, you do this by understanding that you have conflicting ideas & influences in your life and that consequences flow from the choice you make about which influence to play out.  For instance, good & evil do battle in the heart of every person.  The wise person, chooses to do good and keeps evil in check.|`|WMtWiWX3aa	Dualism manifests everywhere and in all aspects of our life. Dualism is in the opposition of day and night, hot and cold, active and passive, matter and space good and bad...<br>  To apply it to our life and within ourselves is though finding the balance of the oppositions and creating the harmony of the two extremes.
pI5jKfmaaa	Idealism is the philosophical theory which maintains that the ultimate nature of reality is based on mind or ideas. It holds that the so-called external or "real world" is inseparable from mind, consciousness, or perception.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism</a><br>  <br>  As a philosophical term, Idealism refers to any view that stresses the central role of the ideal or the spiritual in man's interpretation of experience. It may hold that the world or reality exists essentially as spirit or consciousness, that abstractions and laws are more fundamental in reality than sensory things, or, at least, that whatever exists is known to man in dimensions that are chiefly mental--through and as ideas. Thus the two basic forms of Idealism are metaphysical Idealism, which asserts the ideality of reality, and epistemological Idealism, which holds that in the knowledge process the mind can grasp only the psychic or that its objects are conditioned by their perceptibility. In its metaphysics, Idealism is thus directly opposed to Materialism, the view that the basic substance of the world is matter and that it is known primarily through and as material forms and processes; and in its epistemology, it is opposed to Realism, which holds that in human knowledge objects are grasped and seen as they really are--in their existence outside and independently of the mind. As a philosophy often expressed in bold and expansive syntheses, Idealism is also opposed to various restrictive forms of thought: to Skepticism, with occasional exceptions as in the British Hegelian F.H. Bradley (1846-1924); to Positivism, which stresses observable facts and relations as opposed to ultimates and therefore spurns the speculative "pretensions" of every metaphysic; and often to atheism, since the Idealist commonly extrapolates the concept of mind to embrace an infinite Mind. The essential orientation of Idealism can be sensed through some of its typical tenets: "Truth is the whole, or the Absolute"; "to be is to be perceived"; "reality reveals its ultimate nature more faithfully in its highest qualities (mental) than in its lowest (material)"; "the Ego is both subject and object."<br>    <br>  <a href="http://cyberspacei.com/jesusi/inlight/philosophy/western/Idealism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cyberspacei.com/jesusi/inlight/ph...</a><br>  <br>  Idealism refers to any philosophy that argues that reality is somehow dependent upon the mind rather than independent of it. More extreme versions will deny that the “world” even exists outside of our minds. Narrow versions argue that our understanding of reality reflects the workings of our mind first and foremost — that the properties of objects have no standing independent of minds perceiving them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/philosophyschoolssystems/p/idealism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://atheism.about.com/od/philosophysc...</a>|`|44ujDxwqaa	It is the philosophical theory which maintains that the ultimate nature of reality is based on the mind or ideas. It holds  that the external world or real world is inseperable from the mind, consciousnes, or perception. Reality is what is perceived, feels, and consciously aware of by the mind.|`|u33x2hqzaa	I think it's a belief that there is a rational basis to our lives and that we can both know and live in harmony with the Truth.  Epictetus is my personal favorite philosopher as it relates to applying philosophy to your life.  His philosophy entails both understanding that circumstances are beyond our control but that Zeus (God) gave us a rational mind to think through problems to solutions, to question what we see and to take control of our lives via use of free will based on intelligent, reasoned choice.  In his philosophy there is an upward projectory to life based on our ability to reason and learn to make better, wiser choices in the future.  We become less influenced by the thoughts of others and more self-directed by a desire to learn for ourselves what is true and to base our lives upon it.

ANzszvWRaa	The Church as an institution was immensely important for a long list of reasons:<br>  <br>  * It was controlled and supported by the minority ruling class (the King and his nobles) - they appointed priests, bishops and archbishops, they funded the building of new cathedrals, churches and monasteries and they donated money, land and property to help maintain them. All of this was to ensure their own soul's salvation in the afterlife, but also to help control the majority of the population - along with food, trade, coinage and law, religion was part of the nobility's hold over their subjects.<br>  <br>  * It provided the only opportunities for an education beyond the most rudimentary local village sort (and even this was often provided by parish priests). Since education meant chances for advancement and power, the Church effectively controlled who progressed into high positions.<br>  <br>  * The Church was the centre of life and everyone attended church or chapel regularly. Births, betrothals, marriages and burials were all marked by a blessing or Mass. Beyond this, the Church enforced Holy and Feast days which helped to break up the constant drudgery of hard physical labour.<br>  <br>  * The Church enforced Canon Law (Church Law) which not only applied to the clergy but to everyone in their day-to-day lives. The price of goods and livestock, the morals and behaviour of the population and many aspects of everyday living came under the laws enforced by Bishops at regular court hearings. Penalties varied, but for very minor offences a severe beating would often be the outcome. <br>  <br>  [I have a copy of a Canon Court record from the 12th century regarding a woman named Alice who was charged with slander and using foul language. She failed the ordeal and was judged guilty, being sentenced to walk around the outside of the church while being beaten with clubs - not just once, but on six consecutive Sundays.]<br>  <br>  * The Church was the only form of National Assistance or famine relief that was available in the 12th century. The tithes collected from every peasant and landholder went into the Church's tithe barns; this could in turn be provided back to the needy in the form of alms in times of emergency.|`|GHefTsUyaa	It was the most powerful institution in medieval society because of the hold it had on people's minds.<br>  It's  virtually impossible to understand in to-days secular society the influence the Church had on everyones life.<br>  All folk from the highest to the lowest feared for their immortal souls and what would happen to them if they defied the rule of god,which expressed itself through the church.<br>  The church held a complete grip on the conscience of mortal man.It ruled through fear and threat which,at that time,was considered very <br>  real.<br>  No mortal man dared defy the power of the church then!|`|LdMixoe2aa	One thing that hasn't been mentioned so far is the fact that the Church was a major landowner. By the time of the Reformation I believe it owned nearly a third of England. As landowners people were responsible for paying rent to them (usually in the form of tithes). They also owned several towns and were responsible for setting up markets in churchyards (although this was banned in 1285) and taxing merchants and traders. They had some rights and responsibilities on a par with the nobility. In some villages or towns without a lord and a manor house, the church fulfilled their role instead. Therefore the Church of the 12th century played a huge role in the economy of the country.<br>  <br>  For more information try<br>  <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medieval_church.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/med...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.britainexpress.com/History/TheMedievalChurch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.britainexpress.com/History/Th...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/local_history/village/history_of_a_village_fact_file.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/local...</a> (scroll down until you hit Monastic Charters)|`|LV8uUmehaa	People would have grown up around the Church, going to their local Church regularly.<br>  <br>  When someone fell ill the technology was not advanced, therefore they had to say why they believed something had happened (Good or Bad things), there was God.<br>  <br>  It gave some people something to live for, the poor community of England and Scotland would have been ignored throughout their lives; hence their high belief's in God.

Most british christians today are very laid back and not so effected by it but some cultures such as muslim it is still has very high demands of its people like waking early and praying several times per day.<br>  <br>  In 12th century England & Scotland kings were leading their countries based on the popular belief that the king had 'god on his side.' Kings often spoke of this before battle to have the common folk fight for them. <br>  <br>  Religion was also used as a way of taxing the people. While people would often try to dodge taxes from their king they would never dare dodge taxes from their god.|`|cYgJQDQSaa	Religion was important to all countries in medieval europe, it also affected all strata of society.

spYpsixUaa	Nope, we are not slaves to our hormones.  We can be enslaved to our interpretation of them, though.  I have a nasty habit of ignoring my hunger when I become focused on some work-like activity, and I only notice that I have hungered when my blood-sugar plummets and my mood gets all self-contemptuous (Don't tell Happy that I get that way!).  But overall, I still feel healthy.  In the same sense, pain is a chemical reaction within the nervous system, but some medical mystics have proven that there are techniques which can be used to ignore pain (although wanton use of such a technique is properly discouraged).  The experiencing of pain is a useful event.  In the same way, the experiencing of mood fluctuations caused by hormone and/or enzyme levels can be a beneficial alert system provided by your body.<br>  <br>  I guess you could compare it to being enslaved to a fire alarm siren.  You know that if it goes off, your life depends on noticing that and moving quickly to the door.  So, do you spend all your time doing nothing but watching it, or do you risk not noticing it and let yourself get focused on some captivating activity?|`|Z4YSnC3gaa	Our feelings are an extention of our thoughts which include the biological processes and chemicals that are involved.<br>  <br>  Of course, we have control over our feelings as we have control over our thoughts, the choice of our words, the choice in what we speak about.

The mind is that part of the human being that chooses and make decisions.  The brain is the physical organ on which the mind resides.  Some people say that the brain is a machine whose operation is not understood,  and that the mind is the net effect of this operation.  How the brain works is not a philosophical subject;  such knowledge is covered by medicine,  among other disciplines.  Of course,  the study of mind is a proper subject of philosophy (within limits),  but the relationship between brain and mind is outside philosophy.<br>  <br>  Philosophy would say that humans have free will,  and this is a matter of dispute.  The way I see it,  you have a rock,  and you can predict how it will behave under different circumstances with almost mathematical precision because it is simple.  A human been is much harder to predict.  You cannot tell if a human being would eat a fruit.  It is not merely because you need more information,  such as whether he is hungry,  or likes this particular fruit;  he may choose not to eat it by mere whim.  Free will assumes an ordinary,  healthy human being,  where the machinery of the brain is working properly.<br>  <br>  That said,  it seems the brain is "programed" to shift moods.  "Why" is not a question philosophy can answer,  but can observe it is true.  There may be good reasons why this effect exists,  but philosophy cannot explain them in detail.  The brain is either the result of the hand of God,  or the result of millions of years of evolution.  If from God,  you can safely assume there are good reasons for the shift in moods.  If the result of evolution,  you can safely assume there is survival value in the shift in moods.  Humans are not slaves to this or that hormone in the sense that a car is not slave to this or that particular component.  In a car,  any particular part is present for a reason,  and I extend this reasoning to the brain. <br>  <br>  All this assumes a healthy brain.  Yes,  there are siuations where the machinery of the brain is not working properly,  and medication is properly taken in those cases. That said,  I believe too many people take those medications for what is a normal shift in mood,  where the proper action is not to take medication,  but to embrace the emotion,  learn to articulate what is bothering their minds,  or similar choices.  <br>  <br>  A healthy mind is limited only by the laws of nature.  There is not a slavery in the sense you suggest.|`|HltEZkvQaa	You control your happiness with your actions.You feel bad for a reason.<br>  You need dis-pleasure to learn from your mistakes. <br>  You feel good to let you know you're doing well.<br>  <br>  However, feelings can be ignored/supressed. <br>  Also, if you think positive/ negative your mood will change accordingly (although, as i said before negative feelings have a function don't ignore them (or dwell on them for too long either).<br>  <br>  Humans have powerful enough brains to think about all the factors/consequences of their actions.<br>  <br>  Blaming your behaviour on hormones is a cop out tbh.|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	What, exactly, is your alternative? That our emotions and feelings should arrive some sourceless, amorphous locations, a priori? Maybe, each time we feel something, that God reaches down and 'touches' us? Or that perhaps our emotions are truly "in our head" and they have absolutely no physiological affect on our selves whatsoever?  Obviously the last is false because we all can see with our own eyes the effects of emotions on our bodies as our faces flush, our arms tremble, muscles grow taut or limp...<br>  <br>  Simply because you understand the source of something does not mean that your quality of life should plummet. In fact, for some, that we understand more now, their quality of life should increase; for example those who suffer from life-long battles with depression. Should we resign these souls to battle it out alone or take our understanding and apply it to their lives and help them out?  Your life isn't pre-determined simply because we understand the bio-chemical fundamentals to our emotions.

HwGKErAMaa	If you’re looking for an accurate (or at least close to accurate) European 18th century alternative, they would be rather limited. By that point in time, firearms like the musket and harquebus were taking over the position of blade weapons. Other than certain types of swords and daggers (sometimes paired together), a blade weapon (swords, spears etc.) and flails (like maces) would stick out like a sore thumb. And culture specific weapons like katanas and “monk’s spades” would be equally out-of-place.<br>  <br>  PS: Properly used, a staff could beat a sword in combat. It’s all in the technique and skill of the user.<br>  <br>  PPS: A weapon that doesn't kill? That has to be an oxymoron. However, it's totally possible (and likely) that a person is merely wounded from a weapon, rather than killed. Again, a matter of skill.|`|jDY8KsvTaa	How closely does it need to resemble a sword?<br>  <br>  If it just needs to be a period-appropriate close-combat weapon, maybe a mace or flail would be effective?<br>  <br>  If the character is particularly skilled, quick or sneaky maybe he/she could just use a dagger?|`|AA10248469	Bolo.

p0AUrLgwaa	Actually the 'Americans' who fought at the Alamo were Texans (they called themselves Texicans or Texians). Texas was not a part of the U.S., nor was it trying to be. They were trying to establish the free and independent Republic of Texas. The Battle of the Alamo was fought in order to a) buy time for Sam Houstons army to get organized, and b) they expected to be reinforced by troops from Goliad. Unfortunately the Goliad troops had been overrun and slaughtered by Santa Annas army before they reached San Antonio. Any survivors were executed, just like at the Alamo. .......... incidentally, many of the troops at Goliad were from Georgia originally and were led by Col. Fannin of Georgia. The flag they carried to Texas from Georgia is now the Texas state flag. Bet you didn't know that!|`|kTNz1VJuaa	Originally, Texas was part of Mexico. The early gringo immigrants, who called themselves "Texians", agreed to live by Mexican law.

Santa Anna and the Mexicans wanted Texas as their land, but we wanted to keep it as ours. The battle took place when the nation was being formed and many fights were taking place over land and government with many different countries. While there are some who don't believe we had any business fighting at the Alamo, or even claiming Texas as ours, you will be hard pressed to find someone in the great state of Texas <br>  that would agree. It's just the way we are raised here. We don't have the same views as other states. Probably because we never really intended to become part of the United States, it just worked out better for us and we hold the right to withdraw at any time.|`|zThIaO0Qaa	um they were wrong mexico had already claimed texas as theirs this is just another example of america meddling in things that arent their business george washington was correct when he said yes we can trde with other countries and be friendly but do not get entangled in foreign relations.

However, the help never materialized and thus when Santa Anna finally stormed the fort, the Texians were overwhelmed.

In a charming tip of the literary hat, debut novelist Collins introduces her young heroes Gregor and his little sister Boots into a wonderland through a trip down a long hole-in this case, an opening in a wall of their apartment building's laundry room. While passionately trying to find a way back home, 11-year-old Gregor learns about the Underlanders, their history and their unusual customs. Before long, Vikus, the noble patriarch of the Underlanders, reveals to Gregor an ancient prophecy-and why he believes that the boy is the foretold "overland warrior," come to liberate them from the giant rats. The relationship between Gregor and two-year-old Boots embodies much of the book's charm, and Gregor himself grows up before readers' eyes. His love for his lost father factors heavily into his personality; in a stunning turn of events, he discovers the reason for the disappearance of his father-who also plays a role in the prophecy. Collins does a grand job of world-building, with a fine economy of words-no unnecessary details bog down either the setting or the invigorating story. In her world, a child singing "Patty-Cake" can change the course of history and a stoic rat can mourn the fact that although he is able to read, he cannot write because he has no thumb." <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Gregor-the-Overlander/Suzanne-Collins/e/9780439678131/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Gregor-...</a>

It is amazing how you can write about a relationship like this, I don't know to start to write about it myself and i'm so in love with my husband and would love to write a beautiful poem.

I don't know very many meadows where roses grow. Do you mean wild roses or primroses? I would do a little bit of research to get a flower name that actually grows in meadows. Also, I think you mean "celestial" and not "cellestial." I would also get rid of the word "hark," because it sounds very 19th Century. A nice love poem on its way, though.

It means that she has a great deal of respect for your abilities. <br>  <br>  Beyond that fashion design is a difficult business for all but the most driven to succeed. Very few people actually make it as top designers, most people in the industry end up doing advertising and illustration and sewing. <br>  <br>  It might be too that your Mom would like you to study Law because that is what she wished to do originally, and could not for whatever reasons. Parents sometimes foist their own ambitions onto their children. <br>  She might want you to study Law because she is under the impression that Lawyers make lots of money, some do, others do not. Or she thinks that you would be independent as a result of such a job. Or she simply wishes to be able to tell her friends that her daughter is a Lawyer.|`|HEAAooaWaa	I say go for it.

WshwHtk9aa	Part of the reason for that old saying is that most of the large publishers were in, or had large offices in NYC. That means, the people that read in-coming novels KNEW NYC. They knew what it was like, how people lived and worked and traveled about town. They knew what spots were hot for hanging out, how the weather patterns went, and what native New Yorkers did (and didn't do) for fun.<br>  <br>  So, when some author in podunk Arkansas decided to write a novel set in NYC, they often got all the details wrong. They'd send it off to a publisher in NYC, who would read it, see just how wrong it was in a way the author could not, and refuse to publish it as anyone else familiar with New York would also think the details were wrong.<br>  <br>  The trick, then, is to either use a non-NYC based publisher or to research the living heck out of the subject so that you get it right.<br>  <br>  But it is fine. There are hundreds of books, movies, and television shows that take place in NYC, and for good reason, it is a live, viable, modern city with just about every ethnicity and culture you can imagine within it.<br>  (30 Rock, Law & Order, Die Hard 3, Gossip Girl, Sex in the City, Bonfire of the Vanities, West Side Story, Atlas Shrugged, and many, many more.)<br>  Try this link and tell me no novel set in NYC get's published:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_books_set_in_New_York_City" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_boo...</a>|`|6eaWRGaqaa	As long as it can grab readers, it doesn't matter where it is set! Think of Gossip Girl, that got published, didn't it?<br>  <br>  I love NYC too! I go into the city every few weekends.<br>  -Catherine|`|GW2i2qqUaa	who cares if it wouldnt get published.  If you have something that you must say about New York then say it.  I don't think as writers we should concern ourselves about publishing.  I think if you are writing full time as a career novelist then you may feel you may waste your time writing something unpublishable.  But really, be an artist about it.  Publishers, are the gateway for people that like to read bad literature anyway.  European publishers are better.  I mean some teen ager living in France would probably love to read about New York--would fantasize about going there.  The French also spend more time with art than Americans do.|`|326056bb38492204952cbcb1e17f3898aa	I think that a lot of people would like to know about NYC... They would read it... For instance The Coldest Winter Ever (Its and Urban Novel) It was based on the "Ghetto" of new york. And I went to England and all the youth had read that book... and they were asking me.. Is new york really like that? (I live in Brooklyn, NY)|`|8DwxwhStaa	I think as long as people want to turn the pages to the end and pay to read it (something a publisher would want), almost any subject matter and setting would be acceptable.

oo1bOj9caa	Because the upper class would throw you out and ignore you if you married someone beneath you. You would loose your social contacts and your reputation as well as what they called 'their honour'. Pretty weird concept it was but prevailed during history from the Egyptians to the modern times. Only since the 1950/60s was the class system weakened in most countries. But it still prevails in the USA and UK as well as Japan. If you come from a certain family of the upper class, you have instant recognition by your peers and can be part of their club, meaning being part of the ruling class.|`|bSn1CjFpaa	you were supposed to keep the bloodlines pure, almost like the poor some sort of genetic disease.. plus you didn't gain any land or money for marrying said girl, you were just marrying for love and that was thought to be vulgar for quite some time|`|GNf3tmguaa	if u were from the upper class, you were supposed to marry someone from your class.

draNVjbkaa	He doesn't say the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy when he holds the skull! That's a big mistake and is often used in pop references. He says the "To Be..." in act 3, scene 1 when he is on stage with Claudius, Polonius, and Ophelia. <br>  <br>  When he is holding a skull, he is in a graveyard and finds the skull of Yorrick, the jester who entertained Hamlet as a child.

KHSOVxViaa	The economy was perceived to be grinding to a halt.  There were frequent and widespread strikes in state-owned industries, and the demands of the strikers were often perceived to be excessive, e.g. 50% wage rises.<br>  <br>  These industries were making vast losses, and were drawing in more and more taxpayers' money just to keep them afloat. Products from these state industries were seen to be of poorer quality, and there was no feedback loop to encourage them to make quality products that people and companies wanted.  Productivity was often low compared to their competitors at home and abroad, and the outlook was that things would get worse, not better. <br>  <br>  Many people were unhappy with this use of their taxes, and lost confidence in the Callaghan government to resolve this.  The effect on the economy was severe; inflation topped 20% and people got fed up with frequent price rises.<br>  <br>  Thatcher proposed drastic measures to turn this situation around, such as major reform of strike and picketing laws, a drawing down of taxpayer support for state industries, and the indented de-nationalisation of many of these industries.   It was to be not just a tinkering of the existing system, but a radical change of the economy from a state-owned command economy to a private sector free-market one.<br>  <br>  These policies gave the Conservatives a steady lead in the opinion polls leading up to 1979.  When the election came, they won with a landslide and the policies were implemented, causing much pain but longer-term success.|`|fLMCOSWdaa	Depending on your point of view, you can say that either the Labour Party failed the workers by not introducing socialism and biting the bullet, or that the Unions failed the government by continuing to strike even though Labour were in power.

The two main characters are a Mary Sue and a Gary Stu, who have no flaws and little personality.  There is no real plot, no real conflict occurs, and in the end everything works out perfectly and nothing goes wrong.  They are horrible books aimed at those teens who haven't read much else and so therefor cannot spot the flaws.

But Twilight is mainly about wish fulfillment, so many readers tend to overlook the style. The books are not good texts, they cater to teenage girls.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'm 39, and I've read the first two. No, they are not "genuinely good texts". They are the worst written published books that I have ever read, and most fanfiction puts them to shame.<br>  <br>  The text itself is very simplistic, but with a bizarre random scattering of "big words", many of which are misused. Have you ever read "shipping" fanfic by a 14 year old? It reads pretty much like that - girl meets perfect boy, "true love" ensues for no apparent reason after a couple of days of dislike, all possible obstacles get neatly out of the way at the last minute, they all live happily ever after. Sorry. If you were after an intriguing storyline which happens to be aimed at teens, I recommend Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series.|`|ye6IiFr7aa	yupp!  my cousin (40 years old) read it and loved them!|`|R4WX5twzaa	I agree wholeheartedly with the user "Whollycow." The books are about wish-fulfillment. I'm 19 years old, and I read the whole first book, and let me tell you, that's two days of my life that I'll never get back. The books are really aimed at the 14-16 year old crowd. My step-mom (she's 43 I think) read all of the books and she really liked them, but I can't explain why. I thought they were so juvinile, I felt like reading was making me more stupid. Hooray for irony.<br>  <br>  I guess it's really what kind of books you're into, rather than what age-range they're written for. If you're into the whole "perfect fantasy" thing, then these books are for you, but personally, I think I'll stick with Stephen King.<br>  <br>  EDIT: sbtravelgirl, aren't you missing a book? I thought there was four in the series.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	I'm 19, so close enough to twenty. I read all four books, and I disliked them. There are far better books out there.

I don't do ballet, but I think I can understand. I do other dancing, such as with myself (lol), but when I dance in front of people like a dance off, they always say my moves are too easy. Then, they try and do them, and fall on their booties! It just bugs me.|`|37E2yPGjaa	It annoys me a lot! I do ballet and i have practices where you ar en pointe for 7 hours! It is so painful and VERY hard to get en pointe after 4 hours. Ballet is one of the hardest things out there to do. That is why the dance world is so small.|`|s5yZNq3iaa	Well, if people say its easy, and they can do a pirouette and plie with perfect turnout..then yes they can say it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped xxx|`|V2v66A7Waa	yes; the others never tried it so they are being prejudice.|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	yessssssssssssss it bugs the frekin crap out of|`|6433147ab9f09717fe7b72b8c66ba504aa	i've never heard anyone say that, but ballet sure doesn't seem easy!|`|OdgoiIN9aa	Oh yeah that's definitely annoying. They only say that because the person they saw doing it was good and made it look easy. It is definitely not easy. I'd like to see them take a class for ballet. Let's see if they would say it was easy after that huh?|`|8gHgPuA6aa	to everyone who says it looks and is easy I want you to post a video of you "attempting" to do ballet,then after your done I want you do restate your answer!!!|`|hB6gFOPUaa	Yes, no one really knows about the amount of work a ballet dancer does or how their feet suffer. If they want proof that ballet is hard look at my feet. Ballet is hard deal with it people.|`|vGuZijMFaa	yes, especially when i talk about how sore i am from it.<br>  and people who cannot dance and never have are like "quit whining ballet is so easy."|`|axGcx5kXaa	Definitely. People that say that probably stink at it and are trying to sound athletic.|`|NNX8Qu5Taa	hell yes, i HATE it, if ballet were easy, it would be called football.|`|yqa2sWY7aa	no it annoys me when people say volleyball is easy!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Anyone who says that has obviously never tried it! ^-^|`|ybwqYZ1waa	IF they haven't done it in their life, very. If they are dancers, maybe. If they are professionals, no, because they have spent their life doing so.|`|AA10926364	It only looks easy because the talented people that dance proffesionally make it look so. It is not easy, I am a retired Pro Ballet Dancer and it is definetely not as easy as it looks. I am recovering from a knee replacement at 35 because of the injuries sustained whie dancing. Most of my injuries are as a direct result of the repetitive nature of dance. I now teach because I can never perform again, at least not in the capacity I was active before. When I was about 22, We had a fitness competition with the pro Football team and the Male dancers, The Male dancers prevailed in almost every category including strength except for a few which would include speed, wind sprints, etc...|`|LmM0F2qJaa	YES! But not as much anymore, because, even though it is NOT easy, the only reason most people say it is because it LOOKS easy. <br>  <br>  When I hear some one say that my dance en pointe looks easy, I'm glad; because it means I made it look easy. Of course, I WILL tell them that it wasn't.|`|8S2icURfaa	Yes! I guess it is sort of, but it depends what level your on. It isn't. You use every single muscle in your body all the time. You have to look perfect. Tight and straight.|`|trMsK86jaa	Aye, my mom did ballet and she's suffered from the bone restructuring it does to your feet.

dXW9cPWMaa	Have you read Sara Gruen's "Water for Elephants?" It's a fantastic book. It's not huge, but you do have to take the time to really read it so you get everything. It's about an early-20s boy who drops out of vet school and joins the train circus for a few months, and about what happens to him while he's there. It's absolutely fascinating.<br>  <br>  I always recommend Audrey Niffenegger's "The Time Traveler's Wife," as well. It's kind of sad at times, but overall is an incredible book. It's one of my absolute favorites.<br>  <br>  "Marley & Me," like someone else suggested, is also fantastic, but it will make you cry.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	Twilight series is fantastic for anyone!<br>  <br>  Hunger Games<br>  <br>  Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life|`|qAJZlOmNaa	Check out "The Flying Deuce" by Brian Linn Smith.

Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means.

When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake.

It's set in three time periods, all covering the narrator's and her father's search for Dracula, who's still alive.  It combines a bit of horror, a bit of romance, and a bit of historical fiction.  Amazing.  It should last you quite a few hours.<br>  <br>  The Chrysalids - John Wyndham<br>  This isn't an incredibly long read.

Their only purpose is to reproduce, and so the Handmaids sleep with their commanders (who usually have wives) once a month in hopes that they'll become pregnant and be able to leave after giving birth.  Women aren't allowed to read and only really go out with the other Handmaid's to the market to buy food for the household.

p0AUrLgwaa	Since I have played both for over 20 years, I'll tell you that the approach to both is different. Guitar is a melodic instrument whereas bass is almost a percussion instrument. I can't say which is easier or harder, but most of the bass players I know also play guitar but most guitar players can't play bass. These people who tell you bass is easy because it only has four strings don't know what they're talking about. You've got a huge hole to fill and only four strings to do it with.  Those who say bass is easy aren't doing it right. Listen to Geddy Lee from RUSH. He plays bass right. When one of those wankers can step up and play YYZ, then I'd listen to them.|`|73f1c6fca2f00f0f05402afc4dc0cd03aa	Bass guitar is easier to learn if you already understand its function in a band.  So learning guitar first might help with gaining an understanding of music theory.  Then when you learn bass you'll have a good foundation to start from.  The bass is quicker to learn if you plan on being in a band but for writing music the guitar is the way to go.  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|BpcgdSYZaa	At the end of the day it’s your choice. To be honest I would try both like I did and then choose to learn bass or guitar. It’s a good idea to have one of them as your main instrument. If you try and split your time equally between them you will properly end up okay at both rather than excellent at one.|`|KzbZH4T5aa	bass is becasue you have a easier part in a song usually and only 4 strings. it sounds awesome GO TO BASS!

It's so easy!" so yeah...|`|peybb4Foaa	I play both well...Bass is much easier for me but i dont know about someone else ( i started with guitar)<br>  Bass  too has some difficulties if you try to play some hard songs.Yes you can start faster by bass and youll progress faster.<br>  Actually you can start from Guitar then its much easier to learn bass and you will already have some experience in playing a musical instrument :D

YpcyrLQuaa	I'm still in high school so think of this as peer editing and construction criticism. Essays are tough and so I thought I'd take a few minutes to help.<br>  <br>  I skimmed through your essay and some parts of it were confusing. In paragraph two, you kind of repeated the whole dialogue between Cyprus and Adam. Figure out a way to word it better or cut it short, so it's not that confusing. Other than that, I like the way you use questions. This is a great way to un-bore an essay.<br>  <br>  Also, make your thesis statement more clear. "Is violence ever appropriate?" I'm not entirely sure, but I think from the first paragraph that you agree violence is SOMETIMES appropriate. Stand behind your thesis statement, stand strong.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TIP #1 IF A SENTENCE IS TOO LONG, IT IS PERFECTLY FINE (AND RECOMMENDED) TO BREAK IT INTO TWO SENTENCES. In other words, if you have too many commas, like this, then the sentence just might be too long.<br>  <br>  TIP#2 THE BREAKDOWN OF AN ESSAY: <br>  (5 PARAGRAPHS) <br>  1.INTRODUCTION/THESIS STATEMENT <br>  (Pretty self-explanatory)<br>  2.SUMMARY OF STORY <br>  (This can be no more longer than a page...give them the short version)<br>  3.SUPPORT YOUR THESIS STATEMENT<br>  (State one reason -which supports your thesis statement- that Charles attacks Adam)<br>  4.SUPPORT YOUR THESIS STATEMENT<br>  (State another reason which also supports your thesis statement.)<br>  5.CONCLUSION/EXPLAIN YOUR THESIS STATEMENT<br>  (Here, you can further explain why you agree/disagree if violence is appropriate)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: Here's an example of making a sentence a decent length while keeping your wording and idea.<br>  <br>  Is violence ever appropriate? This is a question that is presented in East of Eden. The story of Cain and Abel is mimicked when Charles violently attacks Aden. Because of this, one would immediately assume through the rest of the book that Charles represents evil and Adam represents good...<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK :)
5Fwuya29aa	you can start by saying that shakespeare always structures his plays in a similar way.  there are always 5 acts and the turning point in the plot is almost always act 3.<br>  <br>  thus, you should use it it show how it changes the aspect of the play.  <br>  1. plotwise, now getting serious- to deaths in one scene.  the play has suddenly turned.  <br>  - this can be signified by mercutio's death, the boys boy, always joking etc.  now he is dead.<br>  - beginning of romeo's isolation.  leads to him being exiled.<br>  -causes juliet's parents to put pressure on her to marry, since they think she is scared about tybalt's death.<br>  -leads to romeo and juliet becoming extremely strained and leads to the events that caused their death.<br>  <br>  2. language<br>  -the play now becomes a tragedy, so the language should change.  imagery etc used by characters would probably become darker.  <br>  I'm very sorry but I haven't read the play in years, so you'll have to work on the tdeas here yourself.<br>  <br>  what we always got points for when talking about language was to see how the language used affected the audience.<br>  <br>  3. character change.  <br>  the events in this scene cause many characters to reveal themselves.<br>  eg. capulet. and juliet and romeo change too.<br>  so maybe explore some of that.<br>  <br>  anyway. then you should conclude with how the scene changes the momentum and tone of the play, prepares the audience for the end. and also, since we know they are destined to die and this scene is so exciting and dramatic, the audience will be glued to their seats finding out how they come to die.<br>  <br>  good luck, sure you'll do well.<br>  x

JQKADWyzaa	It's good.<br>  Mediocre.<br>  <br>  Photography is about making ugly things beautiful. Not taking pictures of already beautifully things.<br>  <br>  However, I can tell that you have the potential, you know the lighting, and angle, and the way to take a beautiful picture, just try to branch out more<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Exposure and lighting are ok, all but the last have soft focusing issues. I find some of the cropping awkward but like the posing.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	I'd like to give you some positive feedback but I can't think of any.  Sorry.<br>  Poor lighting.<br>  Poor composition.<br>  Lousy backgrounds.<br>  All three of those things are very important.  Get yourself some books on basic photography, especially lighting and backgrounds, and practice more and more.<br>  Most beginning photographers do not pay anywhere near enough attention to what's "behind" the subject.  The background can make or break an image.|`|0Dj8pOgoaa	I must tell you... not bad... I like processing... I don;t like soft focus... I see lots of technically issues but you have an eye... you know what ae you doing... and the most important thing... you are thinking !! you trying to find interesting crop... I don;t like couple shadows on your pictures, but its really not bad....  your pictures should be more sharp... when you using this kind of processing... so far not bad... read a bit, some Freeman's books I would recommend... I see some wird feedbacks here... don;t listen that... you have good eye... you looking for something not just taking a pictures... listen just a pros who know how to say: yest this is good... cuz this seasonal photographers are always jealous cuz someone maybe with less experience is taking better pictures... Im not easy guy who telling everyone you have cute photos :P just check my answers you'll see... but in this situation 8/10 for you... keep shooting....|`|rh5vbol9aa	According to me the theme is very important and you have been chosen a marvellous one.|`|VkKS8nQuaa	I'm going to give you some advice on your images, not so much on your photography as I'd need to see much more to make an informed criticism.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems I see with the images as a whole is that they are all soft,... not very sharp images but this could well be (and likely is) the result of having to re-size and upload to the web.  Often, images will deteriorate slightly when doing this and the photographer (you) need to know how to overcome this degradation of image quality before posting.<br>  <br>  With karina, pay special attention to her hair and make efforts because she's made it white to frame her head and hair accordingly.  In the picture of her (karina.jpg) on the edge of the woods, you did well to constrain the depth of field and make her the only in focus subject but at the same time, you lost her head in the background - her white hair blends in with the sky.  Although you chopped a small portion of her head off in this image, it doesn't make it bad.  What DOES make it bad however, is that there is no reason for all that other stuff to be in the image... the weeds beside her are inconsequential to the image - SHE is the subject, not the surroundings so why even have it?  Framing is by rule of thirds, okay but really not necessary for this shot.<br>  <br>  The next image, (karina1.jpg) is again, not very sharp and her hair gets lost in the exposure.  I'm inclined to feel that the white balance in all of these images is off too... did you check it?... it appears to be a little on the yellow side unless it's my monitor (I think not since I do this for a living).  As you can see though, with the background surrounding her hair, she is a little better pronounced in the frame, don't you think?  Watch out for things growing out of people (i.e. the branch coming out of her head)... shoot your subject while being aware of what surrounds them,... if it frames them it can work for you but never do you want something to appear as if it's sticking out of or growing out of the model.  Now that I've mentioned it, it's really bugging you now, right?  <br>  <br>  You will notice too in this image the burned out upper left corner.  Not good.  All you would have had to do was move her maybe 8 inches to your right and you would have eliminated both the stick and that bright spot.  Position is very important... pay attention to it.<br>  <br>  Now, on to the next one (karina2.jpg).  The color is definitely cast incandescent which means you shot this with not just a flash but a room lit by regular bulbs which will cause an orange/yellow color shift.<br>  <br>  If the image is to include her shoes, then they need to be included but not as they are,... too blurry.  Yes, they are not the subject but they are part of the subject so acceptable clarity becomes issue in the proper exposure.  This is definitely a tripod shot or a fast enough lens to allow for hand-holding the camera while gaining that extra depth of acceptable focus (depth of field).<br>  <br>  The arm over her head looks very awkward and unnatural but then maybe that is your intent so I won't go there, however, do you think you need all that space behind her?<br>  <br>  The last two, karina3 and karina4.jpg are pretty decent flash exposures (minus the tree branch).  I like using fill flash at night to eliminate unwanted elements (the things behind the model).  This flash may have been a little bit too close or harsh for the subject to camera distance but it works.  Again, the color shift is off a bit and her skin tones appear unnatural.  Otherwise, I like these two shots.<br>  <br>  I hope you find that my criticism is helpful and not harsh, it is not intended to be.  I do not know what equipment you use, I don't really care.  The tools a photographer uses do not make them a photographer any more than a hammer in the hand, makes one a carpenter.  I do like your work and a little fine tuning by following my advice I hope will serve to improve your images.|`|AisbApmMaa	What I see is the posing is over do. It pulls you away from the model. The one picture the legs is pulling you away from the model. One thing to remember dont have the model face pointing out of frame. Were they look is the way the  viewer will look. If she faces out of frame then have her eyes look the other way into the frame. The frame is the outside of the picture. The picture are not to bad just need work on posing and picture flow. you did a good job of the rule of thirds ( that means dont center the subject).|`|7XaVO1qQaa	i really like these,<br>  my only critique would be that in a couple of them you're relying too heavily on the fact that the  model is drop dead gorgeous and not enough on the composition<br>  anyone can take a good photo of a pretty face,<br>  however if you're going for glamour photography that's fine.<br>  other than that i think they're brilliant.<br>  <br>  also, i really like your backgrounds.|`|d15OFFGeaa	I loved the last picture...<br>  it has the contrast between the girls shirt and a dark background...<br>  the first picture i think its just too close and the  camera was not adjusted well. <br>  I think you have a good concept of taking pictures, but maybe let the model be a little more natural in their poses.

AA11219693	I do not believe that anyone can steal anyone else’s destiny, as I believe destiny to be the best possible way for each person to live through their life, that taking into account all the variables of our person and of our circumstance. For I believe there is the best path for every one to follow in order to ultimately succeed in life. Destiny therefore in my view is not a matter of being content with what we may have, what might automatically come our way next, or what we may find ourselves ending up with at times, but a matter of active search, a constant pursuit. We need to find out what our destiny is, or what is best possible thing for us to do at any particular time in our life – each moment in life could be the moment of revelation of our destiny. <br>  <br>  I therefore believe that instead of someone being able to steal our destiny, as thought it were something we possessed, people could, sometimes, conspire against us to distract us from the best possible course of action, and thus leading us into astray, into some unnatural discomfort or lose, as into accepting a second-rate life as our best. I believe that in life we should keep earnestly searching for the best possible things, and the best possible ways for us to be, to think, to act and ultimately to behave, for when we sincerely and honestly try to find what is good for us, we find what is right fro us, then we seldom fail, and it is then very difficult for the ones in the lurk to ambush or plans and throw everything in disarray. This is very hard to tempt us, to make us afraid, or lose our heart and thereby the greatest opportunities of life, when our purposes taught, when there is no slack in our faithful resolves. <br>  <br>  In life, what matters is not only what we already have, but also what we are seeking to have, what we might have next. The common concept of destiny contains that all-important element of intrigue for us, as we all like to know what will happen next, but this is exactly what destiny is not, I believe destiny, the best and therefore the right course of life, is not what is in place for us merely to know, but to actively seek out, and make into our life as it happens, then the search for destiny remains in reality the search for the maker of our destiny, the best.|`|Fsbsi9SKaa	I could not understand that what is destiny? <br>  But I believe that we have chances.

If we help countless others to the top through our labor, are we not the richer for our journey?  Which is the better destiny?|`|LjsRfaskaa	We make and allow our own destiny.

Each step you learn demi will be harder when you go on point. Not only does your calves have to be strong, but also your thighs, core muscles, ankles etc.<br>  It is ideal to have at least 2-3 years of ballet under your belt before starting pointe classes.

Some teacher's say you just have to be 12, but I don't believe in that. This reason, is because your toes and ankles have to be strong. That is another quality, even if you have been in ballet for years. talk to your instructor.|`|LmM0F2qJaa	You'll have to ask your teacher.

You might end up not liking ballet. Also you may not have the physical strength to do it. Do you have good turn out? A good arch? There is many things to consider when you are going to en pointe. Also you should ask the teacher. It never hurts to ask (: If you are strong enough maybe you could go in a year, but it really depends how you do in the classes. Go to everyclass and work your best. Show that you are dedicated to ballet. Also ask the teacher if you could go on en pointe. If she says no ask her how to get better and so you can go to en pointe. have fun. I love pointe (:|`|wj8DVCBAaa	It really just depends on the kind of rules that your dance teacher gives you<br>  <br>  this is my fifth year taking dance and i started pointe this year<br>  my dance teacher told me that we need to have at least one full good year of ballet or two just you know come every once in a while years. <br>  well pointe your reall do need to know all of the position <br>  lik first, second, third, fourth, and fifth, <br>  you have got to make sure that you know most of your turn <br>  if your dance studio offers a summer class where you can do just pointe in either a group or privite then you might want to ask your parents our gaurdians if you can take that<br>  <br>  i toke a summer class last summer all week with one other person and we both got to do it all year this year<br>  <br>  and then there was two girls who were in it and you know it was just not for them<br>  <br>  so you might really want to take a short pointe class just to see if your feet want to move in them kind of postition or if your ankels are strong enough to hold your weight ( your anckles are the main thing you realy need to watch for !! )<br>  <br>  i toke 4 years of ballet and i wanted to do pointe right when i started because that is the main thing i wanted to do... but i decieded to wait so i would know all the moves already and turns and postitions....good luck hope you get to go on pointe :)|`|vvAKD2ozaa	well ive been doing ballet since i was about 4 or 5 years old and im 14 now and im still not on points, im quite good at it aswell but my teacher doesnt let any of us go on points untill we are 14 or on grade 4 ballet which is our 9th ballet exam but diff people vary, where do you live beacuse it might be different x.
PPwsaeUxaa	I read it as a discussion of how we lose control of ourselves in anger or frustration and how we can also sink into depression. <br>  <br>  Sometimes my body leaves me,<br>  goes into another room<br>  and locks the door. There<br>  <br>  it bangs about<br>  like an angry thief.<br>  <br>  Doesn't this sound a lot like someone who is pissed off and trashing a room? <br>  <br>  In the second part she talks about the "silences" of her body. She cannot feel what her body feels. She feels detached and separated from it. <br>  <br>  What does it do when it sits alone<br>  without a book or anything<br>  resembling love?<br>  <br>  Doesn't that seem a lot like what some people do when they are depressed? <br>  <br>  It expresses the strangeness we sense in our own emotions.|`|AA11359317	This is just my opinion and not an official commentary or anything. But I think it might have something to do with anger, temper, and pouting. The author may be saying that strong feelings separate the normal, logical state of mind or the person's soul from its physical body, that anger is a divisive emotion which makes someone less human, and the body often gets caught up in the anger and sulking to "bang about like an angry thief." The silences in the third stanza seem to be that period of sulking. I have known people who didn't talk to other people, even their own relatives, for years, and that sort of non-communication makes people less human, in a way, as if the spirit and the body were separated and not working together correctly. The last stanza is interesting because it seems the speaker is commenting on that loss of communication, because what makes us most human is the ability to think (or read, which involves processing ideas) on a higher level and to be connected to others whom we love. Anyway, that's just my idea.|`|LqS60B3Baa	The poem starts off great then dies

Myz6awMdaa	I am a double major Biology grad, BSc and all that, and what I don't think is that we evolved from lower life forms to what we are today.  I believe that there is a God, and that this life is actually a training ground for the next to come.  No, I don't mean floating-around-on clouds-in-heaven-when-you-die, either. I believe that God has a purpose for each of us, and life's experiences all are a part of a big patchwork that fits together to make a perfect picture, dark squares, light beautiful squares, murky not so nice squares...At the end when you can sit back and see the whole quilt you'll know which square you were on, when and why. I believe that God is real and that He CARES. I also believe that you can ask  Him and He will answer, if you listen.  I am a Christian-- not a perfect one, and not a preacher, either.  But I know God is there, and if He made us He knows the answers we're looking for.|`|AA11564934	drink|`|GkH5NoFyaa	Clint Eastwood was asked that question in a magazine interview.<br>  <br>  He said that the meaning of life is: "Get your as- out of bed, and go to work/school."|`|26DoxkOBaa	This is what I discovered myself and it’s explained perfectly from a book review of God Speaks written by someone other than myself.<br>  <br>  The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.<br>  <br>  Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simple gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.<br>  <br>  The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in water, conversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.<br>  <br>  When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.<br>  <br>  So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.<br>  <br>  But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.<br>  <br>  Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."<br>  <br>  Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying "There are as many ways to God as there are souls...."<br>  <br>  Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.<br>  <br>  The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."<br>  <br>  The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.|`|X3q2DMdmaa	i thought about this and i only got too there is no meaning but thats jsut as far as i got howed i get that well its just like the concept of infinity for us humans its hard to understand but once you try ot understand you can see how it might be ok so therefore  why does there have to be a meaning to life theres just no meaning we just are<br>  <br>  Obviously that wasnt enough for me and diddnt explain evrything so i said Fu*k you to it and now im nowhere again|`|6mOOskuBaa	Whose life?

OhWmu0R3aa	Sir Thomas More, a personal friend of Henry, didn't actually speak out against the King but rather declined to give an opinion on Henry's break with Rome. He did refuse to sign a request to the Pope to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, but did swear an oath declaring the King the Supreme Head of the English Church "as far as the law of Christ allows" in 1531, after which he tried to resign as Lord Chancellor. Henry refused to accept it. The following year he claimed ill health and Henry granted his request.<br>  <br>  In 1553 he declined an invitation to the King's wedding to Anne Boleyn. More had written to Henry acknowledging Anne's queenship and expressing his desire for his happiness, but his friendship with the old queen, Catherine of Aragon, still prevented him from attending Anne's triumph. His refusal to attend Anne Boleyn's coronation was widely interpreted as a snub against Anne.<br>  He was asked to swear allegiance to the Act of Succession, which led with an anti-Papal preface. He gave no answer.<br>  <br>  He was imprisoned in the Tower on the 17th April 1553 and charged with high treason on the 1st July. As usual with those found guilty of treason he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, but Henry commuted it to a simple beheading. This took place on Tower Green on the 6th July. His head was placed on London Bridge.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Moore refused to sign a letter to the Pope requesting an annulment for King Henry.

It is up to us to create compassion and kindness. The innate human capacity for compassion is often overridden by the delusion of separateness created by the reality that the eyes can't see the connections. Since visual input overrides knowledge, there is a discrepancy between visual and emotional input. The eyes usually win. The next problem is that human emotions are mostly still primitive and few people have a method to train the heart-mind that works. Most religions teach differentiation of belief. What is needed is an all encompassing wisdom. That can be gained through consistent use of the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Nature just is, and those that happen to survive do so because they are "stronger" and better able to survive, not because they were desired or destined to do so. <br>  In a really boiled-down form, ALL of life is a competition for a limited pool of resources. There are too many critters all wanting a limited amount of "stuff" and thus we MUST fight to get our share or else we die and lose out to the creatures that will fight where we won't.<br>  <br>  And what does strongest even mean? To nature, being the "strongest" is often more trying to hit a fluid, moving target than a set one with a clean, clear definition.<br>  <br>  For example, in a fight taking place 65 million years ago, I'd have put my money on a 30 foot T-Rex over a primitive squirrel any day, but the T-Rex grew too large and became ill-equipped to survive when the meteors came and food became scarce and temperatures fell. Suddenly, a small, warm-blooded, fur-covered mammal that needed less food and that could scavenge and eat a wider array of foodstuffs was "stronger" and better able to survive than a giant, muscle-bound, meat-eater. <br>  <br>  Nature is FULL of  examples of creatures that were the strongest, that DID dominate their environments, until one small thing in the environment changed and that previously successful creature stagnated and died out. Some died when the temperature changed. Some died when a specific food or nutrient became scarce. Others died when a new species entered their environment (and even then, the new species may not be physically stronger, it may even be eaten by the older dominant species, but the new species may reproduce faster and consume more resources and that endangers and destroys the older one).<br>  <br>  Even in today's world, who is "the strongest?" <br>  Polar bears are strong, but as they lose their environment their numbers shrink. Are we the strongest with our climate controlled homes, modified foods, and nuclear weapons? We are large and over-populating and dependent on technology; a meteor strike or nuclear war could wipe us out tomorrow. Meanwhile, the lowly cockroach might well survive such events and go on living for a million more years.<br>  So which is truly "stronger?" The cockroach you could crush on a whim today, but that might go on living when your species is gone, or you, who can step on the cockroach? What is strength, then? The ability to kill or the ability to survive? <br>  <br>  Peace does not work as a strategy in nature, not because peace is not nice, but because it can be overcome by a single aggressor. <br>  If I am a pacifist and meet you on the street and say "let's be friends" and you pull a gun and say "give me your money," regardless of which of us is more morally correct or more pleasant, which one of us do you think is really going to walk away from the encounter with my money (i.e. my resources needed for survival)? You will, because you are willing to take it and I would not be willing to defend it. If even 99% of the species on the planet were "peaceful" and agreed to get along, the 1% that was not would soon come to dominate all others. And thus, none of us can afford to be peaceful by nature. Unless it is 100% it is a losing strategy.<br>  <br>  One final point, peace is stagnating. Conflict is strengthening and forces continual change and evolution and invention. The possibility of being eaten makes you develop tools to keep you from being eaten. The possibility that you might not eat, causes you to develop tools to ensure that you do.<br>  Peace is a two-edged sword in that while we would all be peaceful, we would never push for more. Even the most mundane of our modern inventions would not exist if we were not in conflict with our environment and other species. Were it not for disease, we may never have invented the flush toilet, for example.|`|BdI7KXG1aa	It is not the case that nature wants the strongest to survive.The predominant process in nature shaping the evolution of life is "natural selection".The organism that is the fittest for the environment that it is in,survives and reproduces."fitness" in this sense does not mean strongest.It depends on the environmental situation.A famous example is "the slower mouse gets the cheese."|`|gsTpQmGfaa	Humans are peace-loving in nature, we should work in harmony with the planet because we have a high intelligence and should use it responsibly to respect all life.

The kids discover they are caught in a battle between two opposing forces that want very different things for Jonah and Chip's lives. <br>  <br>  Do Jonah and Chip have any choice in the matter?

fI4LqMVMaa	I like it, but there is definitely room for improvement.  Since you want an honest review, I'll list below some of the things that could be done to improve it:<br>  <br>  o The very first sentence is a run on sentence, and needs to be shortened or split into two sentences.<br>  <br>  o This sentence "Seeing his destination just a short way off, Balion decided giving up on his hopeless task and leaned into the wind as he made his way onwards." does not make sense.  Did he decide TO give up on his hopeless task, or did he decide that giving up on his task would be pointless since he was so close anyway?  If he did decide to give up, then why did he press onward?  Why would he even give up if he was so close?  If he didn't give up, then the sentence needs to tell us.  That sentence needs to be clarified.  <br>  <br>  o  In regards to this sentence "You sure they will still be at Jerry’s" unless that is the way the character is supposed to talk, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.  It should be "You're sure..."<br>  <br>  <br>  o Change "If he’s still alive, who’s knows what could have happened since I left!” to "If he’s still alive, WHO knows what could have happened since I left!”<br>  <br>  o This sentence "The two young men had been on the road since early the previous morning, taking turns at jogging whilst walking at a brisk pace had gained them a good half day, but their was still the likely possibility that they could be too late." has gramattical and sense errors, and is a run on sentence.   Try changing it to "The two young men had been on the road since early the previous morning, jogging and walking briskly at intervals to keep their strength up.  While traveling at that pace had gained them a good half a day, there was still a strong chance that they might be too late.<br>  <br>  <br>  o I made some changes in the following sentence "As he ran, Balion thought back to when this had all started.  The previous day, he had been at home by himself when Michal had turned up.  Flustered and weary from running to seek help, Michal explained in short gasps what had happened. His blond hair sweaty and his muscles shaking from fatigue, Michal sank into an offered chair to explain the incident that had occurred at the village (You might want to put in some dialogue here, having Michal actually say that one man was dead and another seriously wounded. He could then explain that he had been sent, by Cecil the Herbman, who said that the mans life was in the balance and his only chance was if Julian could make it to him in time.  It would be better if Michal said this, instead of you telling us he said it.  Then other characters could respond to the news and take action/ask questions, giving you a chance to give the reader more information about what is going on.<br>  <br>  o Immediatly after the information about Julian, you swich back to the reflection on the past.  This transition is a little jarring to the reader, but can be easily fixed.  The following is what I suggest.  I also made a few other changes to the folowing sentances " “Julian could fix anything, so when Balian told a panting Michal that Julian was gone, Michal had panicked.  'What do you mean he’s not here! Where’s he gone? And what about that man? We can’t just leave him to die!" Michal had roared.  Balian tried to placate him, but Michal continued ranting "You're gifted, isn’t there anything you can do?  Why didn't you stop him, why can't you fix this!  We can't let him (name of injured person) die!”  Julian was gone, and there was only one thing for Balian to do: he would just have to see to the injured man himself.<br>  <br>  So that was why Balion was now battling through wind and rain to the Inn of the Clucking Hen, to see if there was anything he could do.  In his head he reviewed all he knew about healing, feeling sick.  He knew in theory what he had to do, but he just wasn’t sure if it would work on a man. He had only practised on animals before, and with mixed success.  He worried that he would mess up, and do more harm then good.<br>  <br>  When Michal and Balian reached the Inn, Michal pushed the heavy door inwards and the wind swept it open.  The strong smells of roasted meats and ale ASSUALTED their senses and the fire in the hearth warmed them.  Smelling the food, Balian realized that he was hungry.  Regretfully, there was no time for that: he had a life to save.<br>  <br>  Balian surveyed the room, looking for the injured man.  Inside the room sat a half dozen men and a like amount of women. The men sat talking in hushed tones, while the women were throwing furtive glances at a man who stood at the bar. Balion recognised a number of the women, and noted that they were both unwed and wearing their best dresses, which was strange.  Balian supposed their dressing up was on account of the man at the bar, a stranger who he did not know.  Whoever the man was he seemed to have captured the females' attention.<br>  <br>  (it doesn't make sense that the whole room goes quiet immediatly when Balian enters, or there wouldn't have been people talking in the description you gave above.  I changed it)   As Balian stood and surveyed the room, people began to notice him and the chatter quieted.  The men gave Balian brief nods of welcome from grim countenances, while the women gave him shy smiles.<br>  <br>  “That’s the injured man's brother, the one I told you about.  Xzen's his name” Said Michal with an indication of his hand to the man standing at the bar. “Come, lets see if the fellow still lives.”<br>  <br>  Michal and Balian made their way over to the bar, and talk began again.  When they reached the bar, Balian looked the stranger over.  Broad shouldered with an angular face, the man had stood with his back to the room.  He turned, however, when the two young men reached him.<br>  <br>  “Xzen, this is Balion, Julian’s grandson.” Michal said to the surprisingly calm stranger.  The stranger, Xzen,  eyed Balion appraisingly.  His gaze slid over Balian's rainsoaked hair and clothing, stopping on the silver ring that adorned his right hand.<br>  “Where is Julian?” asked Xzen in a heavily accented Kingstounge.<br>  <br>  Balion twisted the ring self-consciously, “He’s not here.”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  o You are a good writer.  Your story is compelling, and I must admit I am curious to know what happens.  You simply have to proofread your work.  Pay attention to tenses, switches in location, time, or point of veiw, and gramatical rules.  Watch out for run on or unclear sentances.  Most of all, keep writing.

It jumps around without much rhyme or reason.  I'd say you need to take a serious look the structure of your sentences.<br>  <br>  <br>  Balion pulled at the fabric of his jacket, trying with little success to shut out the wind which rattled through the village of Chal, giving the rain a ferocity of life which was unusual to the sheltered community of stout wooden homes and shops<br>  <br>  This is not a good sentence.  It's a run on and you try to cram a lot of things in at once. Its not a bad image to start with, but you've love control of your structure.  At least I understand what's going on.  Then you throw this in:<br>   The two young men had been on the road since early the previous morning... <br>  and you step away from the here-and-now after just a few paragraphs of story.  Then there's a whole lot of people telling things and saying things to each other, which confuses me because I don't know who these people are, or who I need to remember for that matter.  I'm also not sure /when/ I am.  <br>  <br>  Then you continue to go on about what people had said at some previous point:<br>  What do you mean he’s not here!” Michal had shouted, “Where’s he gone? ..."<br>  which makes me even more confused because I'm not sure when this all happened, and WHEN this story is taking place...<br>  <br>  Then you throw us back into the present with "And that was why Balion was now battling through wind and rain to the Inn of the Clucking Hen, to see if there was anything he could do...." <br>  <br>  which number one, I'm still only know that this character of yours is trudging in a storm to help someone.  who and why got all muddled up in my mind.  Second, that's not a great sentence.  <br>  <br>  Overall I think this has good parts but you really jerk the reader around by going from present, to past, to present in a very short amount of time.  You start with a little bit of narrative then go into summary (and summary is far more boring than real-life action) before the audience has a chance to find their feet.  I'd say cut out that middle man, go with a straight narrative, and reveal the circumstances behind this visit in smaller chunks or at least at a later time, rather than dumping it all in the middle of action.|`|AHuBqplbaa	It's pretty good actually.  some minor issues like 'your' instead of 'you're', and "Seeing Balion the room went quite" should be "Upon seeing balion, the room went quiet."<br>  <br>  I had no problem distinguishing past from present, since you used the subtle, but important "had", but if others got confused, I would chalk it up as something to reformat.<br>  <br>  Seperate this into a couple of sentences to make it more clear.  ie:<br>  "Balion pulled at the fabric of his jacket, failing to shut out the wind which rattled through the village of Chal. The forceful gusts gave the rain a ferocity of life which was unusual to the sheltered community of stout wooden homes and shops"<br>  <br>   I would like to see a little more detail to put myself in the scene - was it a cold wind that gave him shivers?  Was it a dusty wind that hurt his eyes?  Did it flap his hair annoyingly about his face?  Think about how wind can affect someone, how it might affect their mood, how they might feel about it.  This is just an example, of course, I'm not saying you should say all these things, or even describe this part, if you don't feel it is important enough, but imagery can really make a writing come to life.  It's especially important to add a little excitement to the beginning, to draw the reader in.<br>  <br>  Since this is the beginning of the story, I would want it to be more exciting, so that I need to read more.  If the guy that might be dead is important, maybe go into it a bit more, to make it seem a little more important to the characters - give them more feeling about it, because if they don't care, neither will we.<br>  <br>  I would remove the (julian's grandfather) part.  See, only a little bit later you say "Xzen, this is Balion, Julian’s grandson".  This means the first telling is useless, since you properly show it soon enough.<br>  <br>  Anyway, make of it what you will - usually around here advice is frowned on because people just want pats on the back.  Also, if you are serious about wanting good feedback, find a real writing forum - this is not a serious place.  Be warned though - real forums expect people to give reviews in order to receive them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
bGAgDm4qaa	There are several, but here are my favourites.<br>  The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Stephen Donaldon. Hard to get started, the first book is one of the most deppresing books I have ever read, but the books keep getting better.<br>  The Shannara series by Terry Brooks. The very first one, Sword of Shannara is a bit bit lost, he can't seem to make up his mind where he is going. But from then on, it goes from a rather weak post nuclear holocost disaster to one one of the best and true fantasy series.<br>  Anything by Terry Pratchett. His disk world books are fantastic, and very funny.<br>  A rarer one, rrely quoted, is the World of Tiers and the Riverworld books by Philip Jose Farmer.|`|76fa193634e47a7a06961dde2e863ef2aa	Don't take any notice of the poster that states Terry Goodkind's work is awful i too have read the sword of truth series and i thought it was brilliant !|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Try David Eddings - there are several excellent series.<br>  <br>  Goto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eddings" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eddin...</a> to see a full list.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	This is exactly what you should tell a librarian.

cYgJQDQSaa	The traits or a sword master would probably include self restraint and a working knowledge of his weapon and how to use it.  He may well be proficient in several different styles of weapon and fighting, being capable of adapting his attack to suit opponent. Knowledge of weaponry and techniques would mean he'd be able to anticipate threats.<br>  <br>  Physically, depending on the weapon , characteristics may include one arm being more heavily muscled (like Richard the 3rd).  But apart from that there would be no way of knowing perhaps apart from being old - bad swordsmen don't live long.<br>  (I got taught a lesson by an older very experienced swordsman once.  I assumed that as I was younger, faster, fitter, stronger and taller (giving me a longer reach) I would win. I got comprehensively beaten by a far more skilled and cunning opponent.)|`|trMsK86jaa	Well, Miyamoto Mushashi was renowned for being modest and humble when presented by his acheivements, but that probably is after all just a legend (some speculate so) created to propogate the samurai code of Bushido.<br>  <br>  Typically, a Master needs to at least have expertise in some style of sword-fighting considered difficult if not reckless by others.<br>  <br>  If he did indeed exist, Musashi's legendary Two-Sword technique certainly accounts for this,
y2WPkydnaa	Hello. To apply dualism to a person's life would be a bit tricky. I'll be using this definition: Dualism - metaphysical and philosophical duality. One could do this by following a contradictory behavior pattern, in a very very literal sense. But to use the metaphysical sense, one would just have to live their life in a balance, sort of like a Yin Yang existence. I haven't really studied dualism but it would be a little bit harder to follow true dualism than the examples I gave. Good bye.|`|AA11564934	Anyone who believes in a soul is a dualist.

If you look carefully at a seashell, you will notice that the spiralling of it has a certain pattern to it. That is the golden mean in effect as each spiral after the next uses the ratio to find the measurements of the next. You can also see this pattern in the seed of the sunflower, the spiralling effect, the butterfly wingspan versus its length and so on. <br>  <br>  I have attached Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man as it encompasses that golden mean concept behind this famous drawing.|`|TLzknS0eaa	Also known as the golden rectangle ,golden section and sometimes called the rule of thirds in photography<br>  <br>  <a href="http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/goldslide/jbgoldslide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/gold...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/GoldenSection.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/GoldenSect...</a>|`|rh5vbol9aa	The artist, who succesfully transferred his opinions in an art is the  "glolden mean".

2bHacnMBaa	Descartes believed that all things in existence, they are real if the mind can perceive them.  Berkeley said that for anything to exist it must be perceived by the 5 senses.
j5Apt8hWaa	That is rather easy to answer, but maybe not easy to execute.<br>  <br>  First you have to have enough skills to use any camera, any where, under any conditions.<br>  <br>  Most photojournalists have worked for their schools newspaper as a staffer while getting their degree in journalism, mass media or photography and have a working knowledge of the various processed necessary to provide images to the papers photo editor that they can use when laying out the paper in support of the columns of stories written by the staff writers.<br>  <br>  Most students have started out using a 35 mm SLR and used both black and white and colour film (black and white which they process and print before deadline, colour if the school has colour machines to develop and print images or can afford to supply DSLR's to their student photojournalists.<br>  <br>  Currently, photojournalists and editorial photographers own either Nikon or Canon systems with about five different lenses.  Those covering sports and some special assignments can use some of the more exotic lenses like the 400 mm f/2.8, 600 mm f/4 or 200-400 mm f/4}<br>  <br>  Problems are usually unique to each assignment (protective masks can become necessary when covering civil unrest, a ballistic vest if covering combat some place in the world and lens "rain coats" in bad weather, etc)<br>  <br>  Staffing has more to do with the size of the paper, than anything else.  Usually a paper has a core staff, which can be from as few as three or four full timers, some part time staff photographers and stringers<br>  <br>  Overhead can be reduced by hiring photographers who 1) own all their own equipment 2) who work as freelancers and do thus supply their own benefits (retirement, health, dental and disability insurance, vacation time and other commonly accepted benefits usually associated with benefits when an employee.<br>  <br>  if you are interested in working as a photojournalist, you may want to work as a stringer for a small weekly paper and put together some excellent tearsheets as well as a collection of all your editorial images covering all the various subjects typically published in newspapers.<br>  <br>  There should be an organization in OZ like the NPPA (National Press Photographers Association) here in the states.  Attend some of their meetings and start networking with the working pros in your area.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nppa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nppa.org/</a><br>  <br>  I would also suggest that you make an appointment with the photo editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and find out exactly what they are looking for when the hire staff photographers and then work toward that goal.<br>  <br>  Another possibility would be to find your national or international press agency (like AP or Reuters) and work for them as a stringer to get your feet wet, working as a press photographer.

There, he meets his sister, Rhiannon, known as Rhia. Emrys later becomes known as Merlin. The god who lookes like an old man is Dagda, and the evil one is Rhita Gawr.<br>    "As the novel opens, a boy without a name, without a home, and without a memory is determined to find all three. Emrys, as he calls himself, discovers that he possesses a magical power stronger than himself. When he uses this power for hate, he suffers by losing his eyesight. He soon discovers that he has a second sight that allows him to see in a different way. Because he is determined to continue his quest to find the three things he desires, Emrys goes to the land of Fincayra, an island thought to exist only in myth. There Emrys finds some answers and a purpose to his quest. This book is wonderful because the conflict facing Emrys is not only from outside forces but also from within."<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Lost-Years-of-Merlin/T-A-Barron/e/9780399250200/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Los...</a>|`|wh4kcMpLaa	it might be one of this:<br>  <br>  Merlin's Dragon trilogy: <br>  Book I of the Merlin's Dragon trilogy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Great Tree of Avalon trilogy:<br>  <br>  <br>  Book One of The Great Tree of Avalon trilogy:<br>  Child of the Dark Prophecy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Book Two of The Great Tree of Avalon trilogy:<br>  Shadows on the Stars<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Book Three of The Great Tree of Avalon trilogy:<br>  The Eternal Flame<br>  <br>  <br>  The Lost Years of Merlin epic:<br>  <br>  Book One of The Lost Years of Merlin epic:<br>  The Lost Years of Merlin<br>  <br>  Book Two of The Lost Years of Merlin epic:<br>  The Seven Songs of Merlin<br>  <br>  Book Three of The Lost Years of Merlin epic:<br>  The Fires of Merlin<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Book Four of The Lost Years of Merlin epic:<br>  The Mirror of Merlin<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Book Five of The Lost Years of Merlin epic:<br>  The Wings of Merlin<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Adventures of Kate:<br>  <br>  Heartlight<br>  <br>  <br>  The Ancient One<br>  <br>  <br>  The Merlin Effect<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Other Fiction Books:<br>  <br>  Tree Girl<br>  <br>  Picture Books:<br>  <br>  The Day the Stones Walked<br>  <br>  <br>  High as a Hawk<br>  <br>  <br>  Where is Grandpa?<br>  <br>  Non-Fiction Books<br>  <br>  The Hero's Trail<br>  <br>  Nature Books:<br>  <br>  To Walk in Wilderness<br>  <br>  <br>  Rocky Mountain National Park<br>   I got it from his website.
NYU37jfGaa	One point about medieval life that is often overlooked is that not all peasants were the same.  Some were much better off than others, and owned more land, and could afford a better lifestyle. in 'Life in a Medieval Village' Frances and Joseph Gies write:<br>  <br>  'All the village houses belonged to the basic type of medieval building, the "hall" as did the manor house, the barns, and even the church, a single high-ceilinged room, varying in size depending on the number of bays or framed sections.  In peasant houses, bays were usually about fifteen feet square.<br>  <br>  The house of a rich villager might consist of four or even five bays, with entriy in the middle of a long side.  small service rooms were probably partitioned off at one end: a buttery, where drink was kept, and a pantry, for bread, dishes, and utensils, with a passage between leading to a kitchen outside.  A large hall might retain the ancient central hearth, or be heated by a fireplace with a chimney fitted into the wall.<br>  <br>  A middle-level peasant probably lived in a three-bay house, the commonest type.  A cotter (peasants without land) might have a small one-or-two-bay house.  Dwellings commonly still lodged animals as well as human beings, but the byre was more often partititioned off and sometimes positioned at right angles to the living quarters.<br>  <br>  Interiors were lighted bya  few windows, shuttered but unglazed, and by doors, often open during the daytime, through which children and animals wandered freely.  Floors were of beaten earth covered with straw or rushes.  In the centre a fire of wood or of peat burned on a stone heearth, vented through a hole in the roof.  Some hearths were crowned by hoods or funnels to channel the smoke to the makeshift chimney, which might be capped by a barrel with its ends knocked out.  The atmosphere of the house was perpetually smoky from the fire burning all day as water, milk, or porridge simmered on pots on trivets or in footed brass or iron kettles.  At night a fire-cover, a large round ceramic lid with holes, could be put over the blaze.<br>  <br>  The family ate seated on benches or stools at a trestle table, disasembled at night.  Chairs were rarities.  A c upboard or hutch held wooden and earthenware bowls, jugs, and wooden spoons.  Hams, bags and baskets hung from the rafters, away from rats and mice. Clothing, bedding, towels and table linen were stored in chests.  A well-t-do peasant might own silver spoons, brass pots, and pewter dishes.<br>  <br>  The peasant's basic need was subsistence, which meant food and drink produced from grain.  The main necessities of life were bread, pottage or porridge, and ale.  Most peasant bread was made from 'maslin' a mixture of wheat and rye or barley and rye, baked into a coarse dark loaf, consumed in great quantities by men, women and children.<br>  <br>  For the poorer peasant families, pottage was favored over bread as more economical, since it required no milling and therefore escaped both the miller's exaction and the naturla loss of quality in the process.  Peas and beans supplied protein and amino acids to both pottage and bread.  A little fat bacon or salt pork might be added to the pottage along with onions and garlic from the garden.  In spring and summer a variety of vegetables ws available, and some crofts grew fruit trees.  Nuts, berries and roots were gathered in the woods.<br>  <br>  A middling family probably owned a cow or two or three ewes, to provide a supply of milk, cheese, and butter.  Most households kept chickens and pigs to furnish eggs and occasional meat.  Slated and dried fish were available for a price, as were eels, which also might be fished for.|`|kTNz1VJuaa	If they were lucky enough to have a fireplace then there would be a cooking pot hanging above the fire. That and a table was the entire kitchen.<br>  <br>  In some cases, they had a separate "cook house" out back so that an out-of-control fire would not destroy the entire house. It might depend on whether they had a supply of stones to build a chimney.<br>  <br>  Food storage consisted largely of hanging it in a place where animals couldn't get to it. Harvested vegetables would be stored in a "root cellar". The inability to keep meat fresh required that most of it be eaten before it spoils, hence the tradition of "feasting", and the invention of "smoking" meats.|`|ANzszvWRaa	No kitchen, no pantry, no larder, no oven, no stove. For all of those things you would have to look in the house of a wealthy middle-class merchant or the manor house of a baron.<br>  <br>  Peasants lived in one-room houses that were long and narrow. Often one end would house animals such as dairy cows or goats during the winter months - the other end of the house served every purpose such as sleeping, eating, cooking and working. The smoke, stench and noise can only be imagined.<br>  <br>  A central hearth in the earth floor kept the house tolerably warm and was also used for cooking. Food could be hung from the rafters or cross-beams, but most of it was not stored at all, being mainly vegetables. These were grown in the plot next to the cottage and dug up for immediate use. Most cooking was done in earthenware pots placed directly in the fire or hot embers. Bread would be baked daily (again making use of hot embers) and dairy produce such as butter and cheese would also be produced in small quantities as required.<br>  <br>  If you search the web for "Wharram Percy" you will find details of this abandoned medieval village complete with two manor houses, a church and peasant cottages exactly as described above.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	In an average peasant's dwelling of that period you wouldn't have needed much storage space in your kitchen because food wasn't usually plentiful. They probably wouldn't have had a stove or an oven just a fireplace with a griddle that they would use for baking bread etc.

However, if company A has published your other books, it is not always wise to move to company B just because the money is better (there can be good reasons to stay with company A, such as they have already invested in marketing you as an author). If your sales are not the best, company A might choose to not buy your next work (bummer) so you many have to go to company B for less money than you'd like,
YorMkZYAaa	If my memory serves me correctly, YOU are the copyright owner of any material published on blogs, not Myspace (at least not entirely).<br>  <br>  Actually, I found this excerpt from a Google Answers question that states your work is protected on more than one level:<br>  <br>  "Normally, anything published on the internet is automatically copyrighted and belongs to the owner. This means that you may not copy and republish material that you find on the internet without the owner's permission unless otherwise stated. However, with social websites like MySpace, there is another layer of protection. In a nutshell -<br>  <br>  1. You own what you post and likewise everyone else owns what they post.<br>  2. By posting on social websites, you agree to their Terms of Service and by doing so grant them a temporary license to use your work.<br>  3. Therefore, postings are not only protected by the copyright of the original owners but also by the license granted to the websites.<br>  4. To post on social websites, you must own what you post there, in other words, you may not copy someone else's work on Xanga and post iton MySpace without written permission."<br>  <br>  So yes, you can publish it in a book later because it does belong to you.|`|nL8s4ozIaa	u can publish anything unpublished. myspace is not a publishing agency.|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	Well, I wouldn't do that either.

dlGP3iZ6aa	I have problems with this quote.<br>  <br>  First, is culture really something we "buy" into, or is it rather something we find ourselves immersed in without having chosen so? We can certainly choose the extent to which we engage in a culture, but it is impossible to completely dissociate oneself with the culture in which one lives.<br>  <br>  Secondly, "if the culture doesn't work" for who? For me? Who am I to decide whether a culture works? <br>  <br>  Thirdly, what do we mean by "works" here? Whether I simply like it? Whether it is detrimental to humans? In what sense should a culture "work"?<br>  <br>  Fourthly, is "culture" really a clear and singular concept we all have a grasp of? Culture is in fact a combination of many many things that come together and contribute to our social identity.  There are some aspects of culture that might not be good, but to condemn a culture as a whole means that we need to be clear about how we define that culture.<br>  <br>  So, no, I do not think this quote can be connected to a sound philosophy of life.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|de2a032fd31864b266f9f88bfb56b71eaa	Epiphenomenal.<br>  Entirely.
JLdleR96aa	Common Sense, a 50-page pamphlet published anonymously by colonist Thomas Paine, attacked King George III after he had refused to accept the Olive Branch Petition, which asked for a return to former harmony after the violent protests against British taxes.  A quote from the pamphlet reads as follows:<br>      "No man was a warmer wisher for a reconciliation than myself, before the fatal nineteenth of April, 1775, but the moment the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened, sullen tempered Pharaoh of England forever...the wretch, that with the pretended title of Father of his people can unfeelingly hear of their slaughter, and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul"<br>  <br>  <br>  This pamphlet declared that the time had come for colonists to proclaim an independent republic.  Paine argued that independence, which was the American "destiny," would allow America to trade freely with other nations for guns and ammunition and win foreign aid from British enemies.  Finally, Paine stated, independence would give Americans the chance to create a better society-one free from tyranny, with equal social and economic opportunities for all.<br>  <br>  Common Sense sold nearly 500,000 copies and was widely applauded.  In April 1776, George Washington wrote, "I find Common Sense is working a powerful change in the minds of many men."<br>  <br>  It also helped to overcome many colonists' doubts about separating from Britain.<br>  <br>  Finally, the Declaration of Independence drew on the ideas of philosopher John Locke that people enjoy "unalienable rights such as Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."<br>  <br>  Jefferson wrote that governments get their power to govern the people, from the people, and since this was not true in the case of George III, it gave the people the right to alter or abolish any government that threatened their unalienable rights and to install a government that would uphold these principles.  On this reasoning, the American colonies declared their independence from Britain, listing in the declaration the numerous ways King George III has wronged them.<br>  <br>  The Declaration was adopted unanimously by all delegates of the then colonies of the United States.  A rush of pride and anxiety ran through the Patriots (supporters of independence) when they heard the closing vow:<br>  <br>   "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Sacred Honor"|`|D19F6m92aa	Common Sense by Thomas Paine was a simple concise summation of the facts on the ground.  Which was why it was so popular.  However, many people such as John Adams disagreed with it on certain points.  <br>  <br>  The Declaration of Independence was written as a mission statement to the world, stating why we are becoming an independent nation.  It made the whole thing respectable.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Initially the declaration might have come as a shock to some of the social elite in the colonies. A lot of them only wanted justice and fair taxation from the British government and to begin with had no desire for complete independence. It changed the nature of the conflict from a rebellion which could have been ended with some British willingness to compromise into a full scale war that eventually involved the French, Dutch and Spanish which was the last thing the British wanted.

I know you might like photography but there are things to know in order to do it well that you don't know.<br>  <br>  There's a saying that the first rule to photography is that there are no rules.  Although, in principle, that is a truism, the fact is that successful photographers do follow rules of exposure, composition and theme.<br>  <br>  Let me explain each of these to some extent.<br>  <br>  Exposure is the control over the lighting (photography means to draw with light).  In order to have a successful photograph, it's important that you, as the aspiring photographer, gain an understanding of light and it's effect on your media be it film or digital sensor.  Film will record light better than digital at the present time (thank heaven for HDR) but digital can, with programs available, render dreamlike images that until HDR, were only possible with days in the darkroom.  Exposure determines color reproduction, quality of contrast between black and white and is subject to the creative expression of the artist or photographer.<br>  <br>  Composition however, requires training.  There are rules to composition that successful photographers break all the time but in order to succeed in your pursuit of a greatly composed image, you have to understand the purpose or Theme you want to present to the viewer.  Composition is all about showing the viewer what YOU want them to see.  Composition is selective as well as inclusive and exclusive to the view.  Some things you want to be soft and not noticed while others need to jump out and say, LOOK AT ME,... I'm what you're looking at.  The Theme is the result of the composition,... it is the story or effect your image creates be it tears of compassion, joy, or any emotion or question it can generate in the mind of your viewer.  If a picture of a starving child up close conjures up the willingness of a viewer to contribute to the cause to fight hunger in the world, THAT IMAGE IS SUCCESSFUL.<br>  <br>  When you stop to make an image, think of what needs to be in it, why it made you stop and, are there more possibilities.  There are many reasons a person takes a photo and yet tourists only take one.  Why? because they are just that: Tourists<br>  <br>  Photographers see differently.  They see marketability, potential, design and disaster,... a world of potentials standing in one place.|`|AA12323940	I love the goose drinking from the shoreline.  The lines of its feathers and the angle of the body with the angles of the water's interface with the shore gives the feeling of natural continuity (that everything is working together).

The government we live in I honsetly feel, especially when under Bush, tries to use fear to keep us moving along or to keep us still. After reading Rand I no longer read the news the same way.  Al Gore once asked when did entertainment become a bedfellow of news?  It is true, finding news is very difficult in this country.  Obama just lifted a ban on having media photograph the coffins of the dead soliders coming back from Iraq.  No one before noticed that there even was a ban,  There are watchdogs in this country that develop lists of possible people that may cause a disturbance.  It reaslly is creepy.  CNN and Foxnews is horrible.  As a pop star if you speak out against the government you lose all your endorsements--Dixie Chicks.  Obama's increase of taxing people that make over $200,000 I think it was is another classic Rand argument of if you are smart enough to make that kind of money why should the government put a gun to your head and force you to hand it over.

nL8s4ozIaa	What i usually do, is listen to conversations when im having cofee, waiting for the train, or sitting in the park. These conversations help me make characters or plots for stories.<br>   I also read A LOT. and when im done, i often think about how i would have made the story better, and have my own ideas about it. This is not copying or nething. I also watch alot of drama shows. So, my mind it always jumbled with ideas. There is also this website that ive visited to help me with free writing and wrting in general. Check it out!|`|8DwxwhStaa	I can direct you to some sites that will awaken your muse, but the plot and story have to be your own or you will never have the passion to stick with it.

I don't know if they still do, but it might be worth checking.<br>  <br>  You could also ask for guidance at your local Citizens Advice Bureau.|`|KhiWV0Q0aa	lost and found box?|`|jb5LMRbEaa	If your partner's son isn't missing but he/she just lost contact, whitepages.com is really helpful.
iNXqiDIYaa	a brief summary<br>  <br>  The Quest Begins<br>  Something is very wrong in the natural world. Animals and humans battle against harsh winters, scorching summers, and violent storms. As their territory diminishes, the bears lose their way and when spring arrives, the thin and hungry bears have to fight for every mouthful of food.<br>  <br>  In the night skies, the star animals revolve around the Pathway Star, the one still point in the whirling skies. It brings together three bears from different species, each with a tale of extreme hardship. Kallik has lived her life on the ice with her mother and brother. Lusa has never left the zoo where she was born. And Toklo roams the forest with his mother and younger brother, who has always been ill.<br>  <br>  Suddenly separated from those who have always cared for them, these three bears are learning to survive in the wild. With the bear-shaman Ujurak, the bears embark on a long and dangerous quest. They travel through magnificent and often hostile landscapes to the frozen north, where the swirling lights of the Aurora Borealis guide the bears to their journey’s end beyond the stars.
KHSOVxViaa	Many, probably most of the changes in history come from slower, more gradual changes, though sometimes marked with sporadic dramatic events.<br>  <br>  You could pick such a long-term change, and mention some prominent event that was part of that.  There are many to choose from!<br>  <br>  A good example may be The fall of Constantinople.  it was a dramatic event that marked part of the long term encroachment into the Christian lands of Islam in general, and the Ottoman Turks specifically.  It brought to an end the Byzantine Empire, and also marked the end of the Middle Ages.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	The invention of the wheel.

Tambora in 1815 in Indonesia, worldwide temperatures and growing seasons were severely effected and 1816 became known as the year without a summer.<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  Mary Shelley, the author, and her friends were on "summer" vacation at the time, but due to the cold temperatures they had to stay inside. While staying inside they had a contest to see who could write the scariest story. Shelley won, she wrote a story called " Frankenstein ", later it became a book.  That's why in the original book, at the beginning, Frankenstein was discovered in the ice and snow of the North Pole.|`|kTNz1VJuaa	1) pick an event that interests you<br>  <br>  2) write the paper<br>  <br>  3) choose a title after reading your paper several times - it will come automatically
