(Formating memory stick erases all information on memory stick)    or just search for an infrastructure network  and connect to a non-password protected router network then go system update and select that network to download it automatically and install it...    recently released umd's can update it too...
d03016c0ce92c7f681f2c0fa7afdb757aa	When phones get locked it is typically because the person who previously owned the phone didn't pay their bill, or another similar circumstance. You should contact the person that you purchased it from and have them contact T-Mobile. It will be your responsibility to get the previous owner to contact them and get it unlocked. Basically right now the ESN of the phone is Locked/Secured to the account that it was previously set up on.|`|L0KhM9EZaa	If you are talking about a Sim subsidy unlock so you can put another Sim in it then no, sorry.

EY1Il1GJaa	It really depends on the bit-rate and format used (MP3 or AAC) to encode the files as well as the length of the song.  Obviously longer songs as well as those with higher bit rates tend to be larger in file size than others.    However, if you use Apple's standard example (AAC file ripped at 128-Kbps each song 4 minutes long) - a 4GB Nano could store approximately 1,000 songs (an 8GB Nano can store around 2,000 songs).    See this page for details on the Nano:  http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/|`|Hu0rtjHhaa	4 gb = about 1000 4 minute long songs|`|eyMjaLeWaa	I just came across a site that sends you an iPod for free!

3PDO7qXgaa	Because there shouldn't be any.  Cell phone use and driving is very dangerous.      The only positives (if there REALLY is any) are you can have phone conferences on the go.  Skip traffic with GPS enabled on your phone.  Thats all I can think of.|`|c44213d413b75992ba93e58fadb314c3aa	Actually, there aren't many articles supporting cell phone use while driving.  Studies and statistics have shown that a person having a full conversation on the cell phone while driving, is just as dangerous driving drunk.  I watch a lot of Dateline NBC and other informative programs, such as the local news.      Your level of staying alert decreases while driving, and people are more prone to increase their chances of getting into an accident, rather to avoid one.    However, to support your question, I have found a link on line, just check it out below:|`|BRO6NxnBaa	You will have to make the point that it can only be for an emergency (accident, drunk driver, etc...) and a hands free device should be used.|`|AA12376200	the hands free device that they have now is great to start with   g/l on this

1GkqopWnaa	Well. On your phone, when you are on the screen where you would be typing the message, there should be a selection you can choose like "Options" or "Settings". Select that. There SHOULD be things like "Multi-Tap" or "ABC". Somewhere on there, you should be able to change it to T9. If that doesn't work, then you could also go to "Messaging" on your menu. You might see "Settings". Choose this. Look for things that say like ABC of Multi-Tap or ABC2. In your case, it should be ABC2. The reason I said should a lot is because it really depends on the phone and service you have. Every phone has different selections and settings.

e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	GSM phones will not work with Nextel or Sprint.  Sprint's phones and network are CDMA, which doesn't use sim cards.  Nextel's phones and network are iDEN, which uses sim cards, but is not compatible with GSM phones.  If you are looking for an unlocked phone for Nextel, you would have to look for an unlocked iDEN phone.  You can only use other Sprint phones with Sprint due to the ESN number of a non-Sprint phone will not be in Sprint's database of phones.  When buying a Sprint phone(or any CDMA phone for that matter) on eBay, be sure to get the ESN number from the seller BEFORE buying it so that you can call Sprint to make sure that you will be able to activate it.  If the seller refuses to give you the ESN number, do not buy from that person because you will most likely not be able to activate it.|`|61re84dHaa	Nextel and sprint do not use gsm phones.  You need a cdma.  If you are looking for a phone to replace a broken one on Ebay, when you are searching search by carrier - so use Sprint or Nextel.  Verizon, Alltel, Nextel, Sprint are major carriers that use CDMA coverage.  T-Mobile, At&T/Cingular use GSM (they require little sim cards behind the battery).

9FzQYqM9aa	Yes, you should be able to use the converter and plug it into the DVD charger.     However, I have not actually seen either of the coverter/charger you mention and it would be best to make sure you get this confirmed from an electrician before you go about plugging it in. If the specs you mentioned are not correct, it could damage the charger transformer (at the very least!) and maybe also damage the DVD player! so best to pop down to the electrical shop and reconfirm! it will only take 5 mins I guess!!

[NOTE: If your DVD player is DivX compatible, then you can just put the single file on the DVD disc using a burning software like Nero http://www.nero.com/ .

Just because the phone is unlocked does not mean it will roam on any tower at any time...  The various companies have roaming agreements with each other in most areas.  It is possible that the signal is low, and there is no roaming agreement for the tower near you.  This would explain the "emergency only" display as they will process calls of that type without a roamin agreement...    Hope that helps!

5fd3692928eab96b5a98d2e85ee88e3aaa	Apple suggests keeping the volume low. Leave the backlight off as often as possible, put the hold button on when you turn it off, and don't just leave your iPod somewhere where it will turn off after 2 minutes of inactivity.   Also keep your iPod charging until it the battery icon is no longer blinking. (just because the icon says it is fully charged doesn't mean that it is.)  If you plug your iPod into external speakers, turn the iPod volume down and use the volume knob on the speakers to save battery. Then you'll be using the power from the wall socket instead of the iPod battery.  Also avoid extra electronics (like FM radio transmitters) that depend on your iPod's battery to power it. Choose accessories that come with their own battery.|`|mNPMjRFaaa	You could try reducing the volume?  Also don't play the games that makes the battery die quicker.

Sidekicks are GSM phones, which require sim cards in order to work.  They are two completely different technologies and are not compatible with each other.

AA10486529	I haven't seen any "gift cards" for Napster. I use the service and bill it through pay pal. You can create a unlimited library for @ $15 a month and is a good service until you have PC problems. I left Itunes because of it's exclusive DRM which only let you use Ipods. I want to have the music I purchase to be able to play on hardware of the future. Not being forced into re-buying it layer to finance Madonnas hip replacement surgery. Right now I am locked out of Napster because my PC crashed and it said I had deactivated too many PC's.

WwMbpbsKaa	Possibly, they would have to be a MPEG-4   for a iPod to read it. If not you would need a program to read it. I suggest Quicktime Pro. Although, it cost money it works better than conventinal free program. (Normally they are only trial anyway.) Quicktime also works, with iTunes better than other programs. That's why Quicktime is download with iTunes.    The iPod will not be out in stores like Walmart till most of their old systems are sold. Try Radio Shack, same story but since they aren't as big as Walmart, they probably have less in stock than Walmart. OR you can buy off of:  http://www.apple.com  Just click on the iPod link at the top of the page.    I suggest an iPod over a Zune.|`|402dbe86a7e72d74c335e5a8578ed54aaa	yes you can watch movies you download from lime wire or other soft wares but make sure is mp4.
0669bc7b9b40b859d66af10f3bbaf7d9aa	I had the same problem.. this is because the ipod ejects itself .. so you hav to enable ur disk use..     Connect iPod to your computer.   Open iTunes and select the iPod in the source list.   Select the option to Enable disk use  Click OK. or apply before it ejects itself    it worked for me , so i hope it works for u too.
9LCr9ERoaa	Here is the PERFECT camera for you!    You should get the PENTAX Optio W30. It has TONS of features, VERY good picture quality, its sleek & stylish. And to add to all that, its waterproof!

Can you download things onto your phone, such as graphics, ringtones, etc.?  And it all depends on how you get to your voicemail tutorial as to how you set up your voice mail.  Does a Trach Fone come with the feature?  I realize I wasn't much help, but I hope it helped you SOME.  And there should be some sort of Customer Service number you can call.  Either free on your phone or a toll-free number to call from a land line.    GOOD LUCK!  :)|`|OGjYxswjaa	To buy a ringtone from Tracfone does take away mins. Well it lets you choose either to charge a credit card or use your mins. that's if you get them from the site.  You have to put your Serial number and Phone number and it'll give you a list of songs they have for your phone. And....to change ur voicemail message call your voice mail my holding 1 until it dials it and you get a menu to escort you to the right place. If your phone doesn't dial your voice mail try looking for the number in ur phone. good luck!    if you have more problems you can message me if you want :)

MwltNt5Zaa	I would definitely buy now: people will always be upset when they get their new products and there's a better deal in a while. However, I really think this is about the best deal you can get. $250 is as much as the 30GB ipod video was, so they are HIGHLY unlikey to lower the price more, considering that the 80GB video cost $100 more. Also, the main reason for the Video iPod price drop was to combat other retailers, such as Microsoft's Zune, that were selling other players for $250 w/ 30GB hard drives already. Now, the Zune's price just dropped to $199, but I highly doubt that apple will drop he price on the classic, as it will probably be their best seller with such a high storage capacity and low price.|`|fhiTqd29aa	The price is already low as it is (considering how much the iPod Video costed when it came out) an 80 gig iPod is great, but the 160 gig's battery lasts longer + you have more space for movies, but thats all up to you|`|508b33c76e5d9c89b15b1257bd6e9528aa	It's whatever you want to do about it. This whole iPhone price drop nonsense is just stupid. Prices drop people! That's technology. It's nobody's fault but your own if you spent $600 to be one of the first to get one, and the you scream bloody murder when the price drops.     Anyway, it's your own decision on what you want to do. Prices drop, it's just a matter of how long you want to wait, but I don't think the prices will drop until after the holiday season. They also don't go on sale until Sept. 28, so you have time to think.|`|fCLW9woNaa	i think the best thing is to wait. i just got an ipod nano 8gig and then they come out with the ipod nano video!!! the nerve! well you do whatever but i say wait.|`|AA11880577	classic, buy it now.

xzurQOXLaa	yes but wait another week to get it. There currently no problems with it. Steve Jobs even said there arent going to be the same problems but  since it jut came out, wait another week. I have a ipod classic and it works perfectly. i like all the space and the whole metal look it very nice. if you dont like iPods just a a samsung K3 for 90 dollars. I used to have it and it was very good but I like my iPod classic better.|`|xONNVOtOaa	yes i had those issues previously. i had the freezing issue with my video but holding the center button and play button reset it without erasing the songs. i had also bought mine through other places other than apple. but i believe if you take to an apple store, they would still look into it without a charge. the warranty that comes with all ipods cover the first year. the only part they would charge for is the repair itself. if you have looked into getting it repaired through them and if its going to cost as much as a new one, then i would recommend just buying a new one at the apple store. i love going there because you can try them out first and then make a decision. also the employees really know there stuff. i just looked into an ipod touch and went to the store to check all the new ones out first to see if that would be the best one for me. after testing all of them, including the new classic, i finally decided on the ipod touch. i love it!!!|`|7cd952f490d580ac0d6d1904db88b3e2aa	I used to work at an Apple store in the repair section, so I've seen every iPod problem know to man. When it comes to iPod classic, new or old, there are usually 2 answers for why an iPod doesn't work. Either it just broke, or some of the music you loaded on it was corrupted, and therefore corrupted the iPod internal drive. (Skipping songs, volume issues and many other problem come from downloaded music from non iTunes sources.) I've had over 10 iPods so far. 1 broke, the rest are still working. You can try and reset your iPod to factory new standards. There's a program that comes with your iPod to do that. It really cleans it, and erases everything on your iPod. iPod nanos are a bit similar in that bad music files might make it go nuts, but they're significantly more fragile because of the design. Don't buy one unless you have a real need for it: Running/workouts, lower price-     iPod classic: Wait a month or 2 to buy it. They will probably update it once or twice to address any stability issues.|`|AA12336658	If you need to get a new one, I got a free ipod from www.ipodsweepstakes.com  - it's free to enter!

AA12383652	I find it hard to believe that someone who cant answer a question without cussing or take the caps lock off their computer are ipod programmers.      If resetting doesnt help then just take it into the apple store and have the genius bar take a look at it.  It is free for them to take a quick look.    You might want to do a complete restore, but you will lose everything off the ipod.

If you drop kicked it out a window and it's shattered to pieces you may have trouble convincing microsoft to fork over a new one.

seI2KgHUaa	Basically you will need to hook a timer chip with the right timing for the song (5 timer chips, one for green, red, yellow, blue, and orange) and you need to write in the correct timing in hexidecimal for each note, and for every single button. For some buttons (like A and the shoulder buttons) you will need to replicate them and then put the timer chip on the first wire leading TO the button. For the triggers you will need to solder a timer chip to the middle pin, so when the ic sends out a signal it activates the fully triggered position on the pointometer.|`|v3CetSc0aa	if you are asking if you can play with just a controller i know it is possible i have done it.|`|mxKmsf2Daa	that question dose not make sense|`|TgBYy6HBaa	I can't decide if your question "How can I cheat my way to the top of the leaderboards by complex electrical work" is the most annoying question I've seen.

If you're going to go through all the trouble to make a bot, why not spend that time enjoying the game and working your way towards a good score instead of cheating and corrupting the leaderboard?

TgBYy6HBaa	I am going to assume you have a dazzle and are connecting the yellow, white, and red cables to said dazzle.    Then you are plugging in your green blue and red cables into your HDTV.    You have the switch on the AV cables set to HD.      I would try switching to SDTV and seeing if you still get a blank picture first.    Then I would set the dazzle up correctly by splitting the signal so that your xbox is sending two sets of signals.  One to the TV and one to the dazzle.  The signal will be sent through the same original cables so whatever you see on the TV is what will be on the PC.  When you do this the signal quality degrades slightly, but if you're just trying to make a ubar l33t snip3r vid for youtube it won't matter.  If you want HD to the PC then you're going to have to get a signal amplifier, run the cables from the xbox to the amp and then you should have multiple outs that you can send to both the pc and xbox.

TgBYy6HBaa	I don't work for the company, but I am pretty sure I know what's going on here.    As an example we'll say I'm the first person with a broken xbox and you're the second.    I send my broken xbox in for repairs and they send me a new xbox. They fix MY xbox and have it in storage.  Your xbox breaks. You send your's in and as soon as they physically see it, they send you my repaired xbox and start fixing your xbox for the next guy who needs one.    At least that's how most repair/replace operations work.      PS.  To the guy who posted a 5000 word post:    If you receive a manufacturer's waranty it means that they know that a percentage of their devices will fail.  It's too expensive to make everything perfect.  The choice for the company is either make everything absolutely perfect 100% of the time and have the units cost thousands a piece or accept a certain default rate and put the product out cheaper.    In fact, it's far cheaper to save money on production and replace defective units than it is to make every unit work every time.      Microsoft was never suprised that 360s failed.  They only commented on HOW MANY failed.  They were not expecting the 20+ percent failure rate, but they KNEW for a FACT that a percentage would not work.    That goes for every company.  I have experienced ipods, blackberry's, HDTVs, microwaves, GPS devices, and many other electronics fail out of the box only to be happily replaced by the company at no charge.  Did I lash out against these companies?  No.  Do I understand that if I want an xbox at 199 instead of 19,999 that I have to be OK with the reality that there is a 1 in 5 chance that mine will fail?  Yes.      Before you start talking like the enlightened one, try googling "quality control" and learn what that really means.  |`|7tYWqmZnaa	They don't, sometimes they fix your old console. They never send out brand new ones.|`|26b727784ab6c6917ee0c334293b7446aa	Its cheaper to simply repair broken models and dude, get rid of that thing; as I predicted to a friend of mine who seemed to not believe me, 2008 has been the 360's year.  Also this holiday season, Microsoft will seem unstopable however do not be fooled.  Take into consideration for example how calm they were, when that whole RROD fiasco came along, calm, almost as if they were expecting it would happen.  If they were expecting it to happen then that means the 360 may have other flaws that go well beyond just it overheating, for all we know, the system could have a fatal design flaw that may not let it process games the size of what RE5 will be.  Its too early to tell yet, but consider how much the 360 growls and squeals when you play GTA IV; I'm not tech expert but crap man, it sounded to me like the machine was overexerting itself.  Every time it loaded, every time a mission ended, I thought my 360 would melt or something.    I only bought it as a cheap "tide me over while I wait for something better" thing, largely because I did not wish to risk buying a PS3 just yet.  That is ultimately what it is; the 360 is just a hold me over, just like a "practice girl" is.  Now I do not condone that sort of behavior with women and girls but you get the idea.      To give another answer to your question, Microsoft is trying to screw you over; if you bail out now, and get a PS3, you'll save yourself much heartache early next year.  Again, consider how calm they were regarding the RROD, way too calm and unsurprised by it, which makes me wonder what else the company is hiding.  Also consider how reports, even with the so-called improved model, of the RROD have not been reduced, if anything they have become even more frequent.  Microsoft has stated, that new 360 models are better, that the bugs have been fixed but tell me, why do we see more RROD issues than before?    Things will only get worse; the only way Sony can compete, is by making huge games, so freakin' huge, that the 360 can't hope to compete.  Also the technical flaws of that machine are, to me at least, obvious, and not a day goes by that I do not fear seeing that RROD.  I haven't seen it, because I always unplug my console, allowing it too cool completely.  However even that may not save it from the likes of RE5.  Programmers love the 360 because it is very, very easy to program for it, as it is basically a PC on steroids.    With the 360, the same language you use on the PC, you can use on a modified RAM based 360 to program games on, meaning you get done a lot faster, whereas with the PS3, despite its greater power, you have to program on a PC, then convert it, and then test it to see if it works, and because of software translation issues you run into hiccups, thus, game developers hate that thing.    Consider the difference between dating a Russian model, one of those smoking hot, godess like in beauty type, but needing an interpreter, and dating an American playboy centerfold who is not nearly as hot, but still pretty hot and she speaks English.  Most English speakers would rather date the American Playboy girl, simply because she speaks English.  That is kind of how it is with the 360 and the PS3; the 360 is the Playboy girl that speaks English, the game programmer's language, while the PS3, even though a gorgeous, godess like Russian model, speaks Russian, and to speak to her you need an interpreter.    Even so, sooner or later, its only a matter of time before Sony develops a PC with a structure similar to the PS3's, and software language it will have exclusive rights to, when that happens, Microsoft will not be able to compete, and if it tries, it will make games way beyond the limit of what that machine is capable of, too huge for its pathetic cooling system to handle, and when THAT happens, it will be a catastrophe, an RROD holocaust.    There is a landfill in New Mexico with the 360's name on it buddy; get rid of that thing.      Good luck.|`|wos4qTsDaa	sorry but no |`|DZPYKXybaa	they will look to see how long ago you bought the xbox and if it is new they will send you a new model!!!
mL3r2Ox7aa	Get a Sony or a Samsung.     and be sure that its a 1080p and you must buy an HDMI cable to make full use of the HD technology.

GZC0vc5uaa	yes. it's got a few bugs and a lot of the netflix material is also unavailable at this time plus i'd say close to 80% of the xbox population is on at the same time shooting to do the same thing so that will cause slowdown as well. give it a little time and a patch will be released to fix the errors.|`|qngNLLxnaa	its gayin it up for me I hate it|`|zHVw6PKTaa	yup|`|ijld2SHZaa	Well, it didn't freeze up for me but a few of the connections are slow.

But you should be fine, their servers are just loaded down because EVERYONE with xbox live is getting this update.|`|rvBBwdr2aa	Well I search through my friends party look through the people that are in thier parties and then all of a sudden when i try to go back the whole thing just freezes up on me......it is really gay....but i like the new dashboard hopefully a PATCH will be released to fix this soon|`|ERDhkO3Vaa	Ya man. My system has been PERFECT since the day I bought it and as soon as I finished that NXE download and went to my friends page it froze for the first time ever. Its been giving me issues all night.

YZ0rcrceaa	I would choose the Voyager. Yes, you get to touch the iPhone. You could check myspace/facebook on safari. But you can do that with a Voyager also. The reason I would choose the Voyager is that it's on Verizon and it has a physical keyboard. It gives the coolness of a touch screen with the dependability of a keypad. |`|qg3XTq4raa	the iphone hands down   u must pay 30$ for unlimited data 
bX5cZk6Vaa	Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 came out earlier this year around March i believe.  So chances are there's gonna be a whole lot more people playing no.2 rather than the first one.|`|AA11539218	I think they have a second version of it out Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 that came out this year (march 08) and it still has a large following.|`|01Ernkkcaa	Definitely, people still play it but more of them moved to the second installment in the series(Rainbow Six Vegas 2). I recommend you buy the second one, it has many new features compared to the first one and it is much more fun.

tOzSPuM9aa	I wil take that key if you want to give it to me.  And also, i entered the raffle and didnt win, so i guess it really was a raffle.  Im guessing they gave away about 5000-15000 beta keys.  OK thanks, but find out soon becuase the beta ends oct 11 :)  Be sure to pm it so some greedy kid wont try to take it from me.  (Can you even do that? im new here.)

prmvLzNHaa	yes it is .... mgs4,resistance and resistance 2, , far cry 2, and little big planet are worth it ...   ps3 exclusives      xbox exclusives are halo 3,gears of war 1 and 2,halo wars,fable 2,|`|sbNnnPewaa	EDIT-      i now have this game and played it for 8 hrs straight without even realisng  OMG its amazing  i repeat  amazing  kinda easy but dam cute and addictive  i spent over an hr just tryin to figure out how to lift weights into a bucket....this game is mental.....i hav made a crappy level in like 20 mins where u run up a hill jump on a skateboard and fly down a hill and crash ito loads of sponges ....its so dam funny....  everyone in the world needs to buy a ps3 for this  is this the best game in wrld.....im thinkin so....i put it on for half hr b4 bed and ended up sittin here till kids got up:(...im so tired but all i wanna do is play again but kid got lego batman on with his mate :(|`|pl2SocVKaa	yes it is worth getting its a fun good and great game well worth for ps3 a masterful game|`|XnjeTVo3aa	if you are thinking off getting a ps3 don't think about the game that comes with it but just letting you know Little Big Planet is definitely worth it.

Lbp is  a great game, but not completely bug-free (like all games)  im sure the devs are working on fixing the bugs as i type. The online is very good when playing with your friends and you don't HAVE to type to chat you can use a mic also...    The playstation 3 is definitely worth a purchase..if not just for littleBigPlanet but for all the other great games coming out and is out already..
Q3Zo8iJEaa	It would affect your gaming experience in one way: to play any arcade games you purchased, you would need to be connected to xbox live because it is not the original console the arcade games were purchased on.  However microsoft fixed this.  Go here: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/system...  Other than that it should not affect anything if you recovered your gamertag or transfered all of your information using this: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/system...

bOIYk7iCaa	If the RAZR you purchase through eBay is not a T-Mobile phone then you could run into a couple of problems.  As far as I'm aware, T-Mobile and AT&T are the only major providers that use SIM cards.  So you must be sure you buy a phone from either of those carriers.  Secondly, if you do purchase a phone from AT&T, there's a chance that it could be locked to their network.  All you need to do to get it unlocked is call AT&T and ask them for the unlock code...then you're all set!|`|sEe4xmrpaa	yeah it might work|`|C99X5RClaa	yes, but only if the phone is unlocked or tmobile.  if the phone is locked then it will only accept the sim card from the company which it is locked to.|`|a466457e2c6225df30d18dee4f13c077aa	Yes It Should =)  Hope That Helped!
b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	The recording formats that are transferred via USB are a very poor choice for video editing!  Stick with MiniDV or HDV - Digital8 is technically good, but the camcorders are no longer made. You'll need to install a firewire card if your PC hasn't already got one, but it's a small price to pay for easier editing and better quality.|`|rEPjLrEBaa	You can get a LOT of different camcorder in that price range.  You can get high quality, high definition cameras in that price range as well.    If you want to use memory sticks and USB, then get one of Sony's new AVCHD camcorders that record to flash memory.    You will need to get Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum (or Pinnacle Studio Plus) for under $100.  This will allow your computer to import and edit the AVCHD format directly.  If you already have Adobe Premiere Pro CS3, Final Cut Pro 6, Avid Media Composer, or the latest Thomson Grass Valley EDIUS, you don't need to upgrade your video editing software.  If you have a Mac, you can also skip the purchase and use QuickTime Pro ($30) to convert your videos whenever necessary from AVCHD to another format.    You can save a lot of money by using your current computer and editing software that came with your computer for free (Windows Movie Maker or iMovie).  For this, we recommend purchasing a camcorder that records to Digital8, miniDV, or the newer HDV (high definition video).  Sony has HDV camcorders that will memory sticks, but all of these camcorders use Firewire instead of USB.  http://motionpicturecentral.com/forum/ca...

YXDtXMTSaa	There is a step called "Finalize Disc" which needs to be completed to allow DVD's recorded on one player to be  played on other players.    You should put the discs back in the unit used to record them, find the menu or system menu and look for the "Finalize Disc" function, and follow the process.    Try one disc first, finalize it, then attempt to play it on your other players, if they are not ancient players, you should be ok.

THere is a free download in the apple site., here:    http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/    I have had that happen to me before. IT makes it easy if all your things are on it, so all you have to do is restore it. That takes all the info off, and then you can get on your iPod again.    Hope this helps!|`|fz8LGGD4aa	Plug it back to your computer and iTunes will unlock it.    Hope it helps =]|`|gPE0wRTGaa	The only way you can fix it is hooking it up to her iTunes. It may unlock automatically, but if it doesn't the only other way would be completely restoring the iPod to it's factory setting, and then re-uploading all of the songs.

TgBYy6HBaa	I'm glad I'm not the only one who misdials.      What you are experiencing is a marketing technique that is banking on people misdialing.  What people do is they buy a number that is very close to a popular number and then try to sell people products or services similiar to the ones they were trying to reach... or in this case... complimentary to what they were trying to reach.    I used to work for a cell phone company and at one point my boss pointed a misdial to my cell phone and had me try to sell them new plans as they tried to reach the sales number of the real company.  It felt scummy, but even when I explained they mis dialed the phone, they still wanted what I had to sell.    This is the same idea as buying web URLs that are similar to popular web pages.  (example: if the page you want is a webpage.org they will buy webpage.com and hope that you just type .com out of habbit)|`|CdBjZSkBaa	I think you are dialing it wrong.    dial 1-800-469-9269

ACKlp9zwaa	When Rock Band first came out the Guitar Hero guitars would work for it but not Rock Band guitars in Guitar Hero.  Typically, the game is only programmed to look for controllers matching a particular requirement.  When newer stuff comes out it probably will not meet that requirement for older games.    SUPPOSEDLY (and I say that cause I haven't gotten it to work) you can use Rock Band controllers on Guitar Hero World Tour.  I'd look in to it, but I would think You could get RB2 and use those controllers for GHWT.|`|KqOuWwxcaa	Go to MSN.com there is a story about Guitar Hero.... might have the answer.
0UgfalMaaa	so you are using your laptop as a wireless adapter..    huh    Connection Tests: Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)       This test confirms that your network has a sufficient Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). MTU is a setting on your router or gateway that can affect network performance; the MTU diagnostic test will tell you if your router or gateway's MTU is too small.    The MTU determines the largest datagram (a self-contained packet of information) that an IP interface can transmit. The larger the permissable datagram for your router or gateway, the faster the data throughput.    Thus: the larger the datagram, the better the gaming.    Xbox Live requires a minimum MTU setting of 1364, so your router or gateway's MTU must be greater than or equal to 1365. If it's less than 1365 you won't be able to connect to Xbox Live.    If your console does not pass this test, you will not be able to sign in to Xbox Live. In this case, change the MTU setting on your router or gateway to a value of 1365 or greater (see the documentation that came with your device for details).        in other words the mtu is like the speed of the data transfer if it dosen't pass you can't use xbox live or even play with your friends|`|8qx66ivpaa	bro i had the same problem as you few weeks ago  i waited a day without playing then turned it back on the next day n it worked  when you check yout connection the first 2 works then the mtu doesnt that mean the server is probably down you just gotta wait..  |`|7SQO2EUBaa	YUU!

I don't know anybody who didn't own a standard PS2 that is now broken. My cousin's standard PS2 was pretty hardy, it worked for a very long time, but it broke recently.    As for me, I got a slim PS2 a couple of months after they came out. And mine is still working.
gpduRawsaa	From being a owner of a PS3, I think your gonna have to go with the PS3 and not the 360.  The 360 cost 75 dollars a year for online, you cannot play blu-ray, numerous problems have occurred with the 360 (Red Rings of Death), and last if you get a 360 you cant play anymore of your PS2 games.  Now I don't know this for a fact but im pretty sure you can play PS2 games on the newer models if update the software.  Also, I have never had any problems with my PS3 and online is free.  Many good games are coming out this year for the PS3 like Resistance 2 and numerous other games that come out on 360 too like Call of Duty World at War.  In all its your decision buy i recommend you get a PS3 and im sure you will be happy with your decision.    Last, Blu-ray is really really clear if you havent seen a blu-ray movie.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	If you want a good Christmas, get the 360.    If you want a great Christmas, get the PS3.    You really don't need to get anything else with either system except maybe a game or two and a controller or so.  |`|pOi0wewIaa	PS3. It's worth it (trust me)     |`|80c9ee18739b81b41c6788684a35575eaa	get the ps3.  it has a lot of great games coming out this holiday (RESISTANCE 2) and the blu-ray is pretty nice.  also the ps3 online is free, while you have to pay for the xbox.|`|9BlCaQkhaa	You really cant go wrong with the 360.  Its now only 200 bux, and most problems are fixed.  It has the best games out of all three consoles, and also online is by far the best.    IMO the controllers feel more sturdy, and controlelrs seem to work.    Right now PS3 has very few exclusive games worth playing, while 360 has quite a few.  Also, idk about you, but I really don't care about bluray.  When your watching a movie, rarely do you notice the video quality.    Its really what games you want to play    360 exclusives:  -halo 3  -fable 2  -gears of war/gears of war 2    PS3:  -resistance 1/2  -Haze  -socom    I rarely find myself playing my wii at all, and not much PS3, but I do play alot of 360.  |`|17858887a07df0e715f37a4736693c01aa	get the ps3 if your tv is a 1080p the blu- ray movies r great|`|jWY0lMu8aa	"When your watching a movie, rarely do you notice the video quality"    ARE YOU INSANE?!?! If you cant notice the difference, you are watching Blu Rays on a standard 480p     This man has a High Def TV. The difference on 1080 is HUGE. Trust me. Try Pirates of the Carribean.

BkfHgstRaa	taken from an ign walkthrough...    so we begin the epic tale of Stewie, Peter, and Brian's seemingly unrelated  quests to do seemingly pointless stuff. But hey, what's an animated sitcom  these days without pointless narrative, am I right people?    Stewie's up first and his first objective is a doozy: collect 20 weapon  powerups. Start by collecting the 20 inside Stewie's room, then the 4 in the  bathroom, and finally the 8 in Chris' room. You'll need to open wardrobes and  jump up to shelves to get them all.    Once you get 19, return to the bathroom and head down to the main floor. The  final powerup will be outside, but first you must use the mind control ray to  take control of Lois in the kitchen. Guide her around the other end of the  table (away from the microwave oven) and into the living room. Bring her down  to the hoover and use it to push Brian towards the kitchen door. Glorious  freedom!|`|RtP1zoe9aa	you go through the door.|`|hp9LYD4Aaa	That game is old and stupid. Get a PS3.

The console is banned, to test that i am correct, sign into xbox.com.|`|G1NaGF4Raa	The way i see it, is your Xbox itself gets banned.  They don'tt care about your live account, so you could take the HD out and use it in a different xbox.  They have no reason to ban your live account they justdon'tt want anyone to be playing on modded xboxes.  See they check your drive to see if it is flashed with new firmware, and anyone they catch with different firmware, they are going to ban their xbox. Not their live account.
b5386939ea31dd59259dfcae19f7a25daa	The Red lights normally show on the original Xbox 360 because they have cooling problems.  Call Microsoft I think the number is 1800-4my-xbox.  if it is still under warranty then they will fix it for free if not then you will need to pay them.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	How many red lights? What is your error code? Did you unplug it then plug it back in? Did that "fix" it?|`|YeFi54U2aa	red ring of death. it means your 360 has problems and you need to send it in to get it fixed|`|X9T9mMfPaa	I think you might have the "Red Ring of death" which is basically a glitch in the Xbox360. You might want to call Microsoft for support, I heard they were recalling all of the Xbox360's to have them repaired.|`|3a9TPnXcaa	It depends weather you have 1 red light or 3, the most common being the 3 and the 1 eventually leading to the 3, whats happened is the sold joints connected to your GPU chip have overheated and come loose, best bet is to use your warranty and send it away to get fixed properly or if you don't have warranty get someone to fix it which might cost you about $160 max to $120 min, I know because i fixed my 360 myself, took me 2 days but its running just as good as before.

ItEUj0miaa	To get apps you either have to get a Itunes account or get your phoned cracked tutorials are on youtube.com cracking can be dangerous. Ringtones are harder to get legal ringtones you must take a itunes song a crop it down into size in a music program and then pay another $1 or again you can crack it tutorials on youtube.com but again can be dangerous.    Either you go legal:  Itunes store make a account with a credit card.  Pay for apps and download free apps.  RIngtones you must make yourself and still pay for.    Or illegal:  Crack your phone us torrents sites to download apps and use ringtone crack which allows you to use any of you songs for a ringtone. Cracking is dangerous.|`|AA11834922	On your home screen when you unlock your iphone look for the icon that says "App Store" Beneath it.  Touch it, when the screen loads go to the bottom of the screen and look where it says "Search" with a magnifying glass as a symbol. Touch that, then there will be a white bar near the top of the page with the same magnifying glass in it to the left side.  Touch the white bar and a key pad will show upp, type in the name of the app you wish to buy.  When you find the one you like, touch it and there will be a description, rating, and reviews of the App you have selected.  After looking these over, if you want the app, touch the green button on the screen near the upper right which displays the price of the App. After one touch, it will say "Buy Now" in the same spot, touch it again and enter your itunes password. If verified, the App will immediatley start downloading it and you may use it once it is finished.  If it is a large application you downloaded, once it is finished loading you will want to hold down the middle (home) button on your iphone at the same time as you hold the sleep button (top right of the iphone) hold these for about 10 seconds until the screen goes blank. It will restart shortly and you may now use the application.    As for ringtones, you will need to plug your phone into iTunes on your comuter, select a song, and i believe you right click and select make ringtone.  If not, look under the tabs on the upper left of iTunes for something that says create ringtone or something similar.|`|uGtbqLhWaa	This gets a little complicated and I can't give links or full detail because I'm on my iPhone.

Un bon photographe est certes un artiste, mais aussi un grand technicien et il ne suffit pas de savoir cadrer ! La composition d'une photo est essentielle et cela implique un questionnement portant sur le sujet et son contexte, les couleurs, l'angle de la prise de vue, etc. De plus, il faut dornavant penser  la retouche photo grace  des logiciels spcialiss.    Comme bouquin, je te recommende "Le guide de la photo numrique" de Tom Ang paru chez Dessain et Tolra en 2003. Il commence  dater, mais n'empche qu'il demeure un excellent guide.

If you lost your iPod, you could use your files on any manufacturers player. If you convert to AAC, then you limit yourself down to a much smaller range of manufacturers.

To add the files to Windows Media Player, after you have them in mp3, you don't have to but the best way is to find your iTunes folder (usually under "my music"), and move the files to some new folder or just back to "my music."  After you do (or don't) do that you can open up WMP and click F3 to search for media files.  Just click on the file that all of your music is in, or all files (find some hidden stuff sometimes).|`|9AQyHtHHaa	it really doesn't matter there isn't much of a difference|`|L38pnieBaa	It makes the quality of the song less, but it takes less space on your iPod, so it just depends on what you want.  I haven't really noticed any significant decline in the quality of the music, but friends tell me it's lesser.|`|AA12134126	Sure, why not?  _  _  _|`|PDxaVVoIaa	When compared side-by-side, AAC proves itself worthy of replacing MP3 as the new Internet audio standard. Take a look at these AAC advantages over MP3:    Improved compression provides higher-quality results with smaller file sizes   Support for multichannel audio, providing up to 48 full frequency channels   Higher resolution audio, yielding sampling rates up to 96 kHz   Improved decoding efficiency, requiring less processing power for decode   The Data Speaks for Itself  In numerous comparison tests, AAC comes out on top. Check out these impressive results:    AAC compressed audio at 128 Kbps (stereo) has been judged by expert listeners to be indistinguishable from the original uncompressed audio source.*   AAC compressed audio at 96 Kbps generally exceeded the quality of MP3 compressed audio at 128 Kbps. AAC at 128 Kbps provides significantly superior performance than does MP3 at 128 Kbps.*   AAC was the only Internet audio codec evaluated in the range Excellent at 64 Kbps for all of the audio items tested in EBU listening tests.*     So my answer would be yes convert them, many people will answer no to this question for a number of reasons. I.E. time wasting lol! i for one think its well worth the time spent on convertig them to AAC as the quality rapidly increases...  Gd luck...|`|ce19833b1e12d50eeeec8833c96244ddaa	It's not worth it.

dc4b0565434850a3edc68da0a9b29470aa	the Nokia N95 has built in sat nav so that would be the easyest way to get it,                               Nokia 6110  review from                                       "MobileGazette"    ______________________________________...  One of the surprises in last week's 3GSM event, the Nokia 6110 Navigator is a 3G slider phone with inbuilt GPS and Satellite Navigation software.         But wait... didn't Nokia already do this with the N95? Well, yes.. both the 6110 Navigator and N95 are closely related products.    Don't let the "6110" model number fool you into thinking that this is a low end phone.. in fact at 450 before tax and subsidy, the Nokia 6110 Navigator is only around 100 cheaper than the N95.    But before we dwell on the N95/6110 comparison, let's look at the GPS / SatNav system that the 6110 has included. Nokia say that this will be shipped with a "local map" on a memory card, and other maos can be downloaded onto the 6110 through a PC. The 6110 also supports points of interest, traffic information and weather reports (although there may be a cost for these). It's also an HSDPA capable 3.5G device with download speeds of up to 3.6 Mbps.    At first glance, the Nokia 6110 is very similar to the Nokia 6280 or new Nokia E65 sliders. There's a 2.2" 240x320 pixel display, 2 megapixel primary camera, microSD expandable memory and Bluetooth. In terms of 3G phone capabilities, the Nokia 6110 is a pretty average device. Of course, not many other phones have GPS and SatNav!    It's an inexpensive way to get a GPS system, but one critical problem with the 6110 is that the Nokia N95 is a significantly more sophisticated handset. In particular, the N95 sports a 2.6" display (compared to the 2.2" on the 6110), has a 5 megapixel camera and WiFi.    The Nokia 6110 Navigator doesn't appear to be a bad device, but if you can afford a little extra money then we'd suggest looking at the Nokia N95 instead  --------------------------------------...  hope this helps in some way ..|`|Qs0LsBjPaa	N95 is a best/lastest technology and a easiest

However, the DS Lite's game library DESTROYS the PSP's game library.  Sure, the PSP has slick graphics, great sound and a big, beautiful screen, but where are the games?  The list of really good PSP-exclusive games is painfully short.  Other than Killzone: Liberation, Loco Roco, and Metal Gear: Portable Ops, there isn't much else.  Puzzle Quest is great, but you can get it for the DS Lite too.    Furthermore, the DS' touch screen means that there's a larger variety in the types of games that you can play on it vs. the PSP.  PSP games are basically scaled-down PS2 games, which is cool, but isn't really anything different than what's been done before.  The DS has really innovative games like Big Brain Academy, Elite Beat Agents, and Nintendogs.  These are games that introduce new ways of playing, and you can't play them on any other system.    Don't get me wrong, I love the PSP.  It's a great piece of engineering, it's a really powerful system, and you can use it to do a whole bunch of different things.  It's a great gadget.  But if you're looking for the best system for games, it's the DS Lite by a landslide.  I own six games for my PSP, and I own thirty-one - yes, THIRTY-ONE - games for my DS Lite.  Not only does it have more games, but it has more great games as well.

b589e209465a12d019f7b271987321f1aa	To extract the vocal track from an MP3 takes considerable audio engineering know-how. You'd essentially need to figure out what the frequency of the singer's voice is and filter out everything else, which becomes more and more difficult as the frequency of any background noise comes closer to the frequency of the singer's voice.    A better option would be to find them from another source. There are some programs that claim to extract vocal tracks, but the results are generally disappointing. For more information on why, check these articles:    http://www.csp-audio.com/vocalextraction...  http://www.ethanwiner.com/novocals.html|`|c5a54305217dc489c99039b85529c82daa	music match and maybe i tunes|`|506739635906b277aa38dcfcf1b3ce6baa	what worked for me is that i got this program called vocal remover, from www.make-your-own-karaoke.com . it cost 30 dollars tough...    but it works really well for most mp3's but on some of them it sort of ...echos in the back.

3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	If the PS3 was plugged in via component cables before you used the HDMI cables then all you need to do is turn off the power on the front so that the red light is on. Then hold down the same button for a few seconds and the PS3 will beep a few times and then reset itself in order to use the HDMI cable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also check that the cable itself is nice and tight. HDMI cables seem to get very angry when you move them around. jiggle the cable a bit at both end and make sure it is securely plugged into both the TV and the PS3.|`|3TOai9JWaa	On your television you should have these options: VGA-TUNER-VGA COMP-HDMI...You need to switch it to HDMI..You should have a button on your remote labeled SOURCE. Depending on how old your tv is..it sounds like it old..Check it out you should have this option if it has an HDMI connection...Good Luck!|`|TeQhos22aa	You have to change the settings on ps3 first <br>  okay so put your av cable and go to display settings put in the hdmi and yaa|`|13L7xz16aa	Your motherboard is probaly fried.but if thats not the case i dont know|`|0MuRCU5paa	Did you turn the display settings to hdmi?|`|c97c52a8f36c342f3e3b7a1bbb708216aa	You may have to plug in your standard video cable first.  Go to Display Settings, then Video Output Settings and then select HDMI.  Then plug the HDMI cable back in to the PS3 and it should work.|`|lGg8AU1Yaa	okay first you need to put the red yellow and white cords back in, (original setup). go to the tv setting on your PS3 and them when it asks you witch setup you plug in the HDMI and click HDMI setting then you go to the HDMI input and there you go, click yes to save settings and unplug the red yellow and white cords.

AA12116276	First of all, I would guess you're asking should you get an mp3 player or an iPod. Well, an iPod is an mp3 player, as was your Sony. <br>  <br>  Second, you can't use Rhapsody with an iPod, at least not directly. If you get a Sansa and I think a Creative mp3 player, you should be able to use Rhapsody with those. iPods want you to use their software for loading music onto it, i.e. iTunes. If you're using Rhapsody To Go with your Sony, for example, you will lose all those songs if you switch to an iPod. You will either have to buy those songs from iTunes, download them from limewire/torrents or do what I do--get a program that breaks drm on Rhapsody files and then load those songs onto your iPod. I paid about $20 for WMAConvert, and it was worth the money. <br>  <br>  What is a better mp3 player depends on what you need. If I only need 8GB and didn't want to watch videos on my player, I would get a Sansa Clip or some other Sansa player. Most mp3 players with 8GB on them, whether they have video or not, cost less than iPods. I would not buy--and have not ever bought--any iPod other than an iPod Touch just because it offers enough features to somewhat justify its price. Other than that, any iPod is overpriced where other types of mp3 players do just fine.|`|0rpN2419aa	The iPod is absolutely awesome and you will love it.

d92b795cd22c34c27c084a41a4788cefaa	No, but to be safe, UNINSTALL I-Tunes, then reinstall a new version. (And just for the safer side, select "Let me manage my music).    jmealins, PLEASE don't talk... what annoys me more than my own ignorance is the complete ignorance of others.    The reason I-Tunes deletes everything on the IPod is because you TOLD it to. You have it set to auto-update when the IPod is plugged in, and since there is no saved media on the computer, I-Tunes deletes all media on the I-POD.    This, is very helpful if you like to keep your computer collection identical to your ipod collection... but I don't and millions of others agree with me.    And think of it logically... people don't own ONE computer, they own many computers... and if they delete their music off of their computer because it is all in the IPod, it shouldn't just BLANK because of suspected piracy. Besides THAT, Apple has no buisness preventing piracy UNLESS it is their product that is being pirated.    I mean, Microsoft could easily release a patch that detects if a Torrent client is present on the computer and if it is, to format the hard drive (And they would, Microsoft loses millions each year due to piracy), but due to the legal rampifications, they CAN'T do it.|`|c5a54305217dc489c99039b85529c82daa	no|`|cd1910d0b70315cc7ee82750a53f2d10aa	Yes, when you connect an ipod to a different computer and try to sync it, it will need to be wiped before it syncs any of the songs.

You may wish to print a phones price from here and try to get a company store  to match it so you can get an easier to use warrenty. (company stores have better exchange policies)  Nice thing is they ship items very quickly and they are also very reliable when it comes to rebates.     If you go with Ebay I would recommend that you count on needing a new battery for the phone you buy but then if you buy the same model that you have you could then have a backup battery and use your old phone for charging.    Also you should check into the cost of cancelling you may be able to get a phone for free and have a cancelation fee which is less than the price of a new phone. Good luck    Good luck

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The EF 75-300mm lens (in either version) is a cheap, poor quality lens. If you want sharp image quality, this is definitely NOT the lens to get.<br>  <br>  A better lens in this focal range is the EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM, but it will cost you approx. US$200 more.<br>  <br>  And, an even better lens is the EF 70-200mm f/4L USM, which will set you back approx. US$600. This is an excellent price for such a high quality lens. The IS version is better still.<br>  <br>  Remember, the lens you use is the most important factor if you want good, sharp image quality. If you buy a budget telephoto lens, you will most likely regret it, because if the image quality it produces is poor, then you will have wasted your money. That's why, investing extra cash in a good lens to begin with, makes very good sense.<br>  <br>  Have a read of the reviews of all the above lenses to see for yourself how these lenses perform.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	You should get the version with the Image Stabilization, because it will enable you to get shots you could not with the version that does not have any form of image stabilization. When the sun is setting, or when you want to shoot low-noise photographs, you will really appreciate the Image Stabilization in the lens. You will also notice that the version with Image stabilization does come with Canon's USM focusing motor, so you are going to get much faster Autofocus performance.<br>  <br>  From what i have read, the image quality isn't different ( at all ) from the cheaper version, but you do get 2-stop image stabilization. Here is a helpful review:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.the-digital-picture.com/reviews/Canon-EF-75-300mm-f-4-5.6-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-digital-picture.com/revie...</a>|`|i5OVORXgaa	I have that lens and I think it's great!

Especially if you have a Digital Rebel, it has a 1.6X crop effect.  That mean a 28mm = 45mm.  Try look for lens that start wider.  Like the 17-85mm IS lens or the 10-22mm.  Its more expensive but it worth it.
xwSNEYICaa	From having "fundraiser" experience, getting sponsors can be easy.  But, it depends on what you are wanting from it.  If you are wanting businesses to donate money, it is much harder then getting them to donate an item for a prize.  <br>  <br>  First, you need your time/place/event information.  Make this into a flyer, that you will distribute for your tournament, and use them for fundraising.<br>  <br>  Also, make a form that you can fill out with the information about the donation you will get, using things like Name of Business, Address, Donation Information, Value of Donation, ect..   Make sure you send "thank you's" to the business after the tournament.  Many business like to display the letters.<br>  <br>  Next, take your flyers and forms around to businesses and ask to talk to a manager.  Smaller businesses, gyms, restaurants, ect.. are better than Chain Stores (i.e. Best Buy, Wal-Mart, ect..)  Since it is a Wii Tournament, I would try Game Stop and other game stores.  Explain to the manager or owner what you are doing, when it is, and how you will use their donation. <br>  <br>   If you talk to your local newspaper first, they may be able to do an article on it, or at least add it to their calendar section.  This will make it more attractive to businesses, and make them more likely to help you.  Donating a part of the proceeds (money after you take out expenses) to a local or well-known charity will also help.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion: Charge a small fee for entering the tournament and use the donations as prizes.  If you need the money for renting a space, ect... offer a pre-registration special ( for example: $5 fee for registering before March XX, $10 after ..).  This will motivate people to pre-register for a discount.<br>  <br>  You will be surprised at how many businesses will help by donating.  I used to be part of a fundraising committee for a dance studio, and as one of the people mentioned to me, "It's amazing how easy it is to get free stuff, all you need to do is ask".  I would say 1 out 4 businesses would give me something, from a $5 gift card to a $300 gym membership.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

The best thing I can tell you to do is check around whenever you go somewhere to shop.  You can generally find them near the electronics section or front lanes.  Or get on the phone and call around to a few places.    They do not accept checks because they would have to wait for it to clear.  With pre paid you aren't in a contract and if you wrote a check and then they just gave you the minutes but then the check bounced it would be like the company just gave the min away.  So, generally they don't accept checks.    In short, check your local stores.    Hope that helps!|`|47d244d62e953f06f3f23fd44440a3bcaa	maybe a closer store near you some rite aids have phone cards or a local gas station

All people I know end up selling it broken for really cheap and buying a new one.  And no one knows how much because no one knows the extent of the problem because chances are we have never seen it.

ww2E5nxZaa	Okay, first I like to say I am glad your thinking about getting a PS3, because most people have XBOX360s. I have a PS3 and love it. People make it sound like there is no one who plays games online with the PS3, but that's not true. There are plenty of people out there and the game selection has gotten alot better. Plus I don't think there have been many recalls if at all.<br>  <br>  For more info on them go to the PlayStation website at www.us.playstation.com.<br>  <br>  Any my dad got mine for $400 about one in a half years ago. It has a PS3 game, two wireless controllers, a HD hookup and some other things.

If you really want to get your money's worth id recommend buying second hand.

Ebay would be a good place to buy one, so would any games stores which sell second hand ps3's<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|7ylUHV2Saa	the ps3 price will be droped in april/may to 300$ now.<br>  <br>  if you can, get the Uncharted Drakes Fortune ps3 bundle.<br>  it comes with the game Uncharted Drakes Fortune, a 50$ game. the Dualshock 3 controller, a 400$ ps3, the Playstation Network Exclusive game Pain free download voucher, a 10$ game, and a 160GB hard drive, witch if you buy it sepratly, it would be about Aproximatly 70$.<br>  <br>  a 530$ value for 500$.<br>  <br>  <br>  but in april/may, you can get the 80GB ps3 core for 300$ with the console, cables needed, and a controller.

d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	You shouldn't have bought a HTIB system with only 1 HDMI input and output.<br>  <br>  You should take it back, save some more money, and buy Onkyo, Sony or Yamaha home theater receiver that has multi HDMI and component inputs and internal HDMI switching. That way you could hook up your HD cable, Blu-Ray and Xbox and listen to it all in surround sound without having to plug and unplug every time you want to switch sources.<br>  <br>  Right now you are going to be required to unplug the Xbox and plug in the Blu-Ray to see movies. Then you want to watch HD cable, go unplug the Blu-Ray and plug in the HD cable box. You can do all of this with the HDMI cable you just have one input. You can buy a HDMI switch that would allow you to hook up two units and then switch between them but what a pain. <br>  <br>  What you bought is good for one thing only....firewood.|`|ZWHZto1Baa	Hook all of your devices into your tv via whatever connections you have available.

rvMxaNAraa	Yes that is true it does have that but you can side step it.<br>  When you first plug in the ipod it will ask you if you want to sync the ipod, just select 'no.' The ipod will still show up in itunes and all the files on the ipod are visible but not accessible. The ipod will have a set of tabs that will appear to the right of the ipod, when it is selecting. The first tab called 'summary' will have a few check boxes at the bottom. Uncheck the box that says 'sync only checked.'  Now select the boxes that say enable 'disk mode' and 'manually manage music'. In this configuration you can add and delete songs that are on the ipod without disturbing anything that is on the ipod. Also log into your itunes account and authorize the PC once that is done, all the songs that are on the ipod (that were purchased from itunes) can be extracting from the ipod by right clicking the ipod and selecting the option from the drop menu, this will only work for songs that you downloaded from itunes. Once all the songs are in the itunes library that are on the ipod, if you want to convert back to the auto sync method you will need to restore the ipod so make sure everything you want is off the ipod. If you have files on your ipod that are not from itunes but files you converted, there are methods of getting those files off you can use third party programs but you can do it by going through the hidden files accessible through the drive in my computers.|`|ylMZ4mSYaa	Transfer iPod/iPhone/iTouch apps to computer or recover lost or missing music, backup and restore all of iPod/iPhone/iTouch content I recommend you Cucusoft iPhone/iTouch/iPod to Computer Transfer.

It’s a $15 camera that includes a free flashlight.

4f6bfbb68b28201f75fa2be71c4271c8aa	Checkout these official ipod tutorials if you own an ipod  http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?...  http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/...    Be sure to have a descent spyware and virus program or you can scan online free in multiple sources. Make sure you know about safety because many peer to peer networks have viruses. The link below has many resources including free antiviruses.  http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html...            Top P2P programs in order of popularity    1) eDonkey / Overnet http://compnetworking.about.com/gi/dynam...  eDonkey/Overnet is a state-of-the-art P2P file sharing software system. Especially popular in Europe, the two P2P networks eDonkey and Overnet combined support a large base of users and files. The eDonkey P2P client connects to both networks; the Overnet client is being merged into future releases of eDonkey. eDonkey runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers. The free version of eDonkey contains embedded advertising but none of the dreaded "spyware" found in some free file sharing software.     2) Shareaza  http://www.shareaza.com/  Shareaza is an up-and-coming P2P file sharing program. This client offers an extremely powerful search engine capable of connecting to multiple popular P2P networks including eDonkey, BitTorrent and Gnutella. Shareaza file sharing software includes intelligence for detecting fake and/or corrupted files. The free Shareaza download also contains no ads or spyware. As the installed base of Shareaza client users grows, expect Shareaza to become an even better P2P file sharing program.     3) WinMX  http://www.topshareware.com/WinMX-downlo...  WinMX offers a large P2P file sharing network and a feature-rich client program that has evolved over years of development. True, WinMX has a reputation for being complex and more difficult to use than some alternatives. However, WinMX also provides power to users in managing their downloads, and it offers a wide selection of music (MP3) files. Some WinMX users report waiting in long queues to download popular files. WinMX software runs only on the Windows family of operating systems.     4) BitTorrent http://www.bittorrent.com/download  BitTorrent is another free P2P software application. It has attracted a loyal following among those interested in sharing movies and television programs. The offical BitTorrent P2P client generally does not support bandwidth throttling, meaning that it will tend to monopolize a network connection and not allow surfing the Internet or otherwise utilizing the network while files are being downloaded or uploaded. A freely-available alternative BitTorrent client overcomes this limitation.     5) Limewire http://www.limewire.com/english/content/...  The Limewire P2P file sharing program connects to the Gnutella P2P network. Limewire client software is widely recognized for its clean user interface that does not contain adware. Sometimes billed as the "fastest file sharing program," Limewire claims to offer relatively good search and download performance. Free Limewire software downloads are available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Limewire Pro pay clients also exist.     6) Morpheus http://www.morpheus.com/download.asp  Morpheus P2P client application downloads exist in both free and paid Ultra versions. Compared to the free version, the Morpheus Ultra download additionally removes bundled advertising. Morpheus clients are capable of searching Gnutella2, FastTrack, eDonkey2K and Overnet P2P networks.     7) eMule http://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/g...  The eMule project started with the goal of building an improved free eDonkey client. eMule has achieved a large user base, connecting both to the eDonkey P2P file sharing network and a few others. It contains no advertising, and its software base is well-maintained by an open source development team. The chief limitation of eMule's P2P file sharing program is its speed: eMule typically performs downloading much slower than other P2P clients.     8) Ares http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/  Ares is a full-featured free P2P network with its own file sharing programs including Ares Galaxy. Ares clients support decentralized music and other file sharing and include a built-in chat service. Ares strives to offer the simplicity of Kazaa clients with no adware and fast connection times.     9) BearShare http://www.bearshare.com/  The BearShare P2P file sharing program is a popular free software client for the Gnutella P2P network. Both free and pay downloads of BearShare file sharing programs exist.     10) Kazaa http://www.kazaa.com/us/products/downloa...  The Kazaa software family (including the Kazaa Lite family of applications) has been the single-most popular P2P file sharing program / system of all time.

For example if you displaying white bright single line for aminute than change to other channel you will still be able to see that line but of course it's going to disappeared soon.  I bet if you do that longer you'll have that line in your screen forever.    It's different case if the image not sharp and bright like channel logo for example it's very rare it will burn in the screen    But new plasma has anti burn in tech inside.

Burn-in is a small factor.. most companies like Pioneer(thebest) and Samsung(the best Priced)  have technology built in to elimate the chances or fix burnin.  you have to leave the same image on the screen on the same spot for hours for it to burn in. once you change channels its like an etch a sketch effect... the xenon gas shifts around  so its not in the same spot.  go to my website and get my email address.. if you  need more info on technology.  but plasma is the best our there in sizes 37 and up..  LCD 37inches and down. Projection if you want to save money up front and spend it later.  DLP and LCD projection TVs run off of a bulb  and that bulb has a 2 to 4 year life span.  where your getting 10 plus years on  a  lcd or plasma..  and after 10 years your gonna prob. want a new tv anyways.|`|AfZfy7A9aa	Here are some deals from Philips outlet    50 in Pixel Plus Plasma Flat HDTV(50PF9431D/37B ) $1100  42 in Pixel Plus Plasma Flat HDTV(42PF7320A/37B ) $789.99  DVD Home Theater System (HTS3440/37B) $119.99     http://www.mandrekar.com/item3.php?mid=6...

DWU0iCbVaa	It all depends on how much you are looking to spend, guitar prices range from $100 to $50,000. If your little brother is just starting off playing guitar i would suggest going for a cheaper model seeing as he might not even like playing. I have known many people who throw down a lot of money for guitars and then they cant get past the steep learning curve at first and give up.   So for a good beginner guitar i would recommend a Epiphone, this was my first electric and for the money it is the best deal in my opinion. Epiphone is a subsidiary off of Gibson Guitar and they make really nice products for anyone, not just beginners.   A big part of picking a guitar is test playing them before you drop the cash, so i would recommend going to your local guitar shop, one that specializes in guitars because they will have the most knowledge, and just play a few until you find one.|`|zifEvqy2aa	1st how old is he? it makes a difference in the size if he is a teen look at a epiphone special SG you can find them at www.musicians friend.com for about 150 to 200. good entry level guitar

Switch to Sprint.|`|f2cc569f92bb1570b53bfbbc7466f8ffaa	There are a few ways you can do it.  First, are you the only line on your plan or are you on a family share plan?    Either way, you could add a text package to your account.  The available text packages are:  $10 - Unlimited to Verizon, 500 messages to other carriers  $15 - Unlimited to Verizon, 1500 messages to other carriers  $20 - Unlimited to Verizon, 5000 messages to other carriers    http://getitnow.vzwshop.com/index.aspx?i...    The $20 package is really useless.  If you're on a single line plan, you can switch over to the America's Choice Select plan.  It's $20 more per month, but you get unlimited text messaging to everybody.    If you're on a family share plan, the America's Choice Select plan is $30 more per month, but it gives unlimited text messaging to all the lines on the account.

OhLsp1N5aa	1366x768 is the resolution for 720p viewing.  To decide which resolution works best for you, you should consider the distance you will be viewing your TV from.     1080p is better than 720p because of the higher resolution being able to show more detail, however there are some things to consider.    By sitting farther away from your TV you won't be able to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p so save yourself the money and go with 720p (1366x768 resolution)  If you're up close to the TV and want the best resolution available, go with 1080p.  However, at the present time, not much is offered in 1080p.  Blu-Ray and HD-DVD can get 1080p, but the best you'll get from HDTV is 1080i  (which will take advantage of the higher resolution) but many HD channels (mostly sports) will be broadcast in 720p.    To sum it up:    Consider how far you'll be away from your TV, how much money you can spend, and If will have any sources that would fully utilize 1080p (i.e. using your TV as a computer monitor, Blu-Ray, HD-DVD, etc.)    Here is a GREAT article about "when 1080p matters":    http://www.carltonbale.com/2006/11/1080p...

e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	You should have done your research BEFORE you bought it.  You can't use a Sidekick with Sprint or ANY other CDMA carrier.  Sprint's phones and network are CDMA, which doesn't use sim cards.  The Sidekick is a GSM phone, which requires a sim card in order to work.  They are two completely different technologies and are not compatible with each other.  If you want to use the Sidekick, you'll have to switch to T-Mobile as it is only for T-Mobile.  One person mentioned Cingular, but the problem with that is you would have to get it unlocked, and that is very hard to do.  T-Mobile can't even get an unlock code for the Sidekicks.  Even IF you managed to get it unlocked, it is pointless to use it with a different GSM carrier since the data servers the Sidekicks use are only accessible through T-Mobile.|`|3a5TVWY3aa	u cant because cdma phones (which is sprint and verizon) dont use sim cards while gsm phones (cingular and t-mobile), so u cant use it with sprint no matter how hard u tried its impossible because they use different technologies. u can either activate the sidekick with t-mobile or cingular but remember the early termination fee with sprint is $200 per line. hope that helped!!|`|j7Cg2Syaaa	If you have your old phone chip, try sticking it into your sidekick 3.

f2cc569f92bb1570b53bfbbc7466f8ffaa	The enV works much better than the Chocolate.  The Chocolate is a huge pain to deal with.  I've seen dozens of Chocolates come back with a screen that has gone completely white.  The phone works, but you can't see anything on the screen.  Sometimes the touch screen goes out, and you can't use the phone.  Sometimes the phone freaks out when it's opened and starts calling random people.  The Chocolate is a cool looking phone, but it doesn't work very well.    I've never had any problems with the enV, but it is a little bit bigger.      There is a new version of the Chocolate being released in the next two weeks or so (LG VX8550) that is supposed to fix all of the bugs from the previous model.  Hopefully that will happen because I think that Chocolate is a very cool concept.  The newer model also looks a bit better.|`|AA11257113	The en V because the Chocolate is tempermental...if you accidentally press a button it goes to something that you don't even want.

bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	Hi Mac  it is pretty simple and not much to worry about.  If you purchase your phone direct from Motorola, you can either purchase a Cingular branded Plbl or Razr with all the correct settings, or you can purchase the unlocked unbranded version of the phone, go to Cingulars support website and enter the Cingular settings. All features will work.   If your husband does not use the internet, then you would not have to  enter Cingulars settings, the phone will still make and recieve calls and send texts.  If you purchase unlocked unbranded from other sources such as ebay, these will be phones typically  made for sale in the european market, in this case you will have to imput the cingular settings again only if he wants to access the internet.  If you do purchase a European Motorola, just make sure it is a quadband (GSM850/900/1800/1900) Some Razrs and pebls made for the UK are only tri-band (gsm900/1800/1900). If you purchase the European version, it must be quadband for Cingular because Cingular runs on GSM850 in some areas. Hope this helped, if you find something, you can send me the link if you are unsure  Cheers|`|AfZfy7A9aa	There is a new unlocked Motorola RAZR at 30% off price here. I ain't sure about buying a used cellphone.....but you may try site like eBay.    http://www.mandrekar.com/item3.php?pid=1...|`|52HAyfLzaa	Any GSM cell phone that is unlocked will work.  You should not have any problem with any of the features, I only know this because i have both bought and sold many unlocked phones on ebay.  I am also a cingular dealer, so I know what they where trying to do.  That is to scare you away from buying any phone but one that they have in store or over the phone, and that will cost you 200-300 dollars.  Hope that this ansewer helps.

d4148282f321cb514949b5445d6610fbaa	i have an older powershot that does that from time to time. usually, the batteries are low or have died. once the camera no longer has power to run on, it shuts down and stays in whatever state it's in. so if you were taking pictures with the lens open and the power fails, it will be unable to close the lens.|`|Jbr1UquLaa	if it is a cannon power shot.. mine does that sometimes. Just take the battery out put it back in.. and turn it on again. should be fine

AA10508288	It is very dangerous to extract the gold because it involves use of hazardous chemicals.  The amount of gold that you could get is not worth the expense.  If you want to clip all of the gold plated leads and gold plated parts it would require a huge amount of time.  Best of luck.|`|7pWA6nD0aa	well young bill gates i dont think that its going to work this time. otherwise everybody would be doing it. i say just get rid of the old junk its not really worth your time mate. good luck anyway.|`|yEzDz8P4aa	Smash the computers into small pieces and put the mess into a wading pool filled with water.  Buy a miner's pan and fill it 3/4 of the way with the junk, put the pan under the water and swirl it.  Being heavy, the gold will stay in the pan.    This procedure might not work.

TnRpfJjFaa	no if you use your home ac charger. there is a built in regulator in it so that it will not overcharge your phone. the car charger is a different story though. that is a rapid charge system and is designed to be used for no longer than a few hours at most.|`|XCx1Obnuaa	no if, once charge the phone stops charging it should be right. the length of battery life usually depends on what brand it is. i have a nokia n series and it stays on about all week.|`|Rqr5ORbLaa	this is kinda how it works. it may seem crazy, but its almost like the phone has to be trained. lets say at 3o clock in the afternoon and the battery is dead, once u charge it, let if charge until it is fully charged. if u happen to leave it on the charger all nite, then thats fine, but once u take it off the charger, dont recharge until the battery is dead again. if u continue to charge your phone when it does not need it, then the battery will ruin and will never hold a charge.|`|Z5IxPHSgaa	yes it could damage ur battery|`|3a37c6d3eb9e914f155df7ad545276f4aa	The guy at suncom told me to just charge it and then take it off the charger.

Rys4Zc7Uaa	I think this place will work:  http://www.fonefinder.net/    I have tested it for land line and cell phone numbers and they both come up correct.
O3ccN33naa	MP3's wouldn't work. I burn MP3's on to CD's and I can still only get up to 19 songs because of the file size. It is unfortunate you can't use DVD's because that is probably the only way that there is. You can get an MP3 player, or an iPod, or something that like. That is likely the only way. Especially if you just need entertainment for 3 hours on the road or something like that.|`|895c61d53a7ffc4de8304a5ff26a1b3aaa	You can converthe songs into MP3 file. You can just put them in folders and save the folders to CD-Rs but they won't play in CD players. The longest I have seen is 80 minutes so check ebay.com.|`|ddi9mWJiaa	The program you are using to burn most likely has an option to burn a DATA CD. use that to put your songs on there, you will get over 10 times more songs per cd. they will be saved as mp3 instead of wav files.

WKwqxbFOaa	This is easy to do:      1. connect your PSP to your PC with the proper usb cable   2. next put the PSP into USB mode (scroll all the way to the left in the home menu then scroll up/down till you see "USB Connection" highlighted then hit "X" button)  3. next open "My Computer" on your PC and look for the new drive that is detected (this is the PSP)  4. double click on it then open the PSP folder  5. inside there you should see a folder labeled MUSIC, if you don't create it just as you would any other new folder on your PC and name it MUSIC and be sure to use caps or the PSP won't detect it  6. after that you just copy/paste the music from your PC into that folder.    7. if you want the songs on a particular playlist create a folder inside the MUSIC folder that has the name of the playlist and place the songs there (this doesn't have to be in caps). Don't create any sub-folders in the playlist folder you create or the PSP won't see the songs that you put in that sub-folder     I hope that answers your question.  Have fun with your PSP.
Rys4Zc7Uaa	Click no? Or click the x?|`|gjNhqZveaa	usally theres something that says never ask  me this question again and just click that button
TpkOfTStaa	It could be that your phone or battery is defective or try cleaning your contacts|`|rvtOlXMDaa	Might be a bad connection...  Try this:  Pop the battery out.  Take a pencil with a new eraser on it, and gently rub the battery contacts so they are clean and bright.  Do the same to the phone contacts for the battery.  Make sure the eraser does not leave any debris behind on either the phone or the battery.  Pop the battery back in.  Do not turn the phone back on yet!  Fully charge the phone.  Now, turn the phone back on.  Check the battery - see if it holds a charge...  If not, it might be new-battery time...    Hope this helps!    PS - if you use a car charger a lot, they can toast batteries a lot sooner than a wall charger...|`|t562uTmMaa	It's worn out.|`|15zZrVSbaa	how long have you had your phone? sometimes batteries can just get worn out from so many times of being charged and running out. i had this happen once.

8kl3yX4raa	Airplane mode means that the part of the phone that sends and receives phone calls is shut down.  But you will be able to access phone numbers and games and if your phone has an mp3 player or itunes you can also access that!|`|8514de359341a97221d9a6a65946d504aa	airplane mode turns the actual phone portion of your phone off so you can still use the games, or listen to music that is on a memory card in the phone, and tell time. you can still use the phone but you can not to make or receive calls.
5TsTYWz2aa	yes it is worth it. i switched from an ipod video to a zune and have favored the zune slot more becuase of the duarbility, ease of use, screen size, music quality, portability, radio, pictures look amazing in landscape mode, and a website i found which i use to feed my zune with tons of videos ZuneBoards.com.  the only downfall with the zune is the software no the device it tends to really slow up your computer. and no you do not need to change your audio format the zune supports the biggest audio formats used WMA, MP3, and ACC and sure there is more but you rarely see them or use them|`|6d2e742fff31d53f69a79e7c939ae969aa	Yes!   After a crappy experience with my old iPod (which isn't unusual) I got a Zune and can't be happier!  The screen is huge, the earbuds are better, the battery life is better, and it's customizable!  I'd go for it!    Hope that helps...|`|NsRBgpeHaa	anything microsoft goes bad fast|`|cggWLcwKaa	yes its alot better then an ipod. it real easy to work and no you don't need to convert your music to play it on the zune i transfered my whole library from itunes into my zune with out a problem. and i am a very happy costomer with the zune product|`|WAh7F5O8aa	Hi Stevie,  I bought a Zune for my husband to replace his Ipod.  (His Ipod broke several times and after being repaired for the third time in a matter of months, we went with the Zune).  He likes the Zune better than his previous Ipod.  He says he likes the controls better and thinks they are easier to use.  He had quite an extensive library of music he had bought from Itunes and saved to disc.  The music on disc easily uploaded to his Zune.  Hope this helps.|`|f2lSeCDfaa	i think you should consider other players than the zune...you can go on youtube and watch reviews to see what people who own them think about it
tLkfemiOaa	yes u can, limewire is where all of my thousands of songs come from, just instal the program then when u are downloading something open up your iTunes and limewire at the same time then when the download is complete drag the song from ur limewire libary to an iTunes playlist    (if u are lookin for a free place to get Limewire go to filehippo.com)|`|m7GyiWCDaa	Try TubeHunter Ultra which downloads Music/Audios and videos from hundreds of video sharing webs to any format you want.      ===========================  TubeHunter Ultra downloads YouTube/Myspace/Metacafe/Dailymotion videos to PC/iPOD/PSP/ZUNE/MOBILE  Homepage of TubeHunter - "www.neoretix dot com"

UsYV6AS1aa	I have a creative zen V. and so far, as long as it's an MP3 file, it's not been a problem, just drag and drop. Creative music explorer is a good program too. and it lets you compress the files so you can get more on the device. good luck!
We9Y0RNfaa	The camera is a good camera if you looking to take good pics with it, personally I would have purchased through best buy or circuit city. but here is a online reveiw of it.: http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content...|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	it will do fine  be happy with it|`|9739f8fc71f62f7fc5e21dbf4885fe62aa	I have owned one of these cameras, they are fine when they work!!!!!!!! mine was replaced , then repaired, finally I threw it in the bin. There is a problem with digital cameras, they are not made to last.  At the price you can replace  it when you break it.    My pro -film camera, I have used almost daily, is some forty years old and still out performs my  digital Canon and Sony cameras.
UsYV6AS1aa	Not much of an answer, but I'd say you are screwed. Why did you take apart your Zen?
0asH8dJiaa	It probably doesn't support your type of phone.  Check and see if it does.  If that is true then it doesn't work for you service.  Also you might want to try maybe sending it as a like .mid file  by uploading it to a freewebs.com account or  try sending it from an email account as a music file.
0asH8dJiaa	Yep just look in your contacts for the number   PMT  Then follow it through to more options.  Then just turn it off.  Or have whoever owns the plan just go their billing section on the verizon homepage.  And turn it off manually =p|`|AA12225393	The only way I could get it turned off was for me to call and talk to someone and tell them to block it.  There is an option through "My Account" on your phone, or the Verizon website, but they always gave me an error when I tried them.
5hxClRWSaa	the razr. it's much betr than a krazr. krazr are just pieces of plastic...
cGTg3btwaa	Depends on the kind of phone you have. I have a LG en-V and a card reader. All I have to do is drop the mp3's onto a memory card and put into my phone. My wife has a Razr. She has to plug her phone into the computer and sync it with Windows Media. Then she just transfers the songs either directly to the phones memory or onto the memory card in her phone. You may want to call a verizon store. They'll be able to tell you which you can do. Hope this helps.|`|Rm1FgWyDaa	You can use mp3 to ringtone gold to help you , just download it at http://www.oursdownload.com/mp3-to-wav,w...

opmAVQXmaa	T-Mobile uses GSM technology. Sprint/Verizon use CDMA. Nextel uses IDEN. Some older GSM networks are being upgraded to WCDMA so such a  phone would work with GSM as well.
5xm6pS2Saa	Well, I'm not sure what you have, but I have Verizon. All I have to do is click I think the right button but it might be left and then it saves. It says save on it, but that's Verizon. Hope I helped you!
DqckZ8Kxaa	possible if ur prepaid (sim) is tmobile too.
XqIgRhVUaa	yes u can just plug in ur iPod to ur computer and click ur iPods name where the playlists are and it will show ur ipod and below it click restore to factoy setting|`|1fhP1oddaa	You could try formatting it there's a 65% chance this will work    To format = Plug in your mp3* Go to start* Go to my computer* Right click you mp3 and choose format* save music/video to your PC before formatting*
5xm6pS2Saa	I guess you shouldn't have bought a phone in Mexico...bring it to T-Mobile or AT&T and see what's wrong. Or just bring to some cell phone place and have them check it out. Wouldn't hurt, would it?
gRKltmmCaa	You can't download it for free...as far as I know. You get to Vcast through your verizon account online, but you have to pay for the downloads.|`|0bYhcGR8aa	You must buy the music essentials kit 30$.|`|NYIiqLYaaa	I think its based on what format can Vcast play? I don't own a vcast so I dont know I'm sure you can find a mp3 convrter that lets you convert to vcast format.|`|953847b4d89093fd0b835b40bb498800aa	ok. well theres not really v cast for free. go to the get it now section in music and tones. normally the first one to show up will be v cast music. click on it, it will load up and take it from there. now syncing music (like taking songs from iTunes and putting them on ur ipod) convertig to phone is harder. you will have to buy a music software (usuusally available at vzw.com) and then like make folders for music. its kinda confusing and takes awhile
QmsiKRdgaa	Try to run a house fan near the vents of the tv or if you are savy enough install one on the inside of the tv. It keeps blowing bulbs from overheating terrible design from mitsubishi not enough air flow and heat dissipation.|`|fpb41Ge3aa	As they say in India, Holy Cow!  Forgive my crudeness, but what a load of crap!    First, power has always been dirty.  For that reason, power supplies are designed to operate over a range of voltages.  One of the components of a power supply is a voltage regulator.  If power slips too low, well, not enough power and the unit simply shuts off.  Too high and the overload circuit kicks in, cutting off power.  If no overload circuit, well, the worst that happens is the power supply bridge craps out.  A relatively cheap fix for that.    As for the lamps, they run at one brightness.  The brightness setting is an electronic gain control for video, like the volume on the audio.  It has NO effect on the bulb's brightness.    As for a bulb going out in 10 months, I could reluctantly accept that.  Not happily, but stuff happens.  Two bulbs, though, is something wrong.  All Mitsubishi needs to tell you is who you take it to for warranty repair.  Nothing in Indonesia is going to change that.    As someone suggested, get the dealer involved where you bought the unit.  Hold them responsible, even if they try to weasel out of it.  They still sold it to you, so they bear some of the responsibility.|`|BzD6ziaoaa	I would talk to someone at the store where you bought the TV and ask if they can put you in touch with a Mitsubishi representative.  Normally they will have a number that is more direct, since they mostly will only recieve such requests for help if someone's problem has not been solved by using the regular contacts.  Even though there is a lot of frustration pent up if you get to talk to someone higher up, explaining the amount of time you've already spent and telling the representatives some of the questions you've already gone over will help them to understand you and assist you faster.  I think people actually get slower service when they sound upset from the beginning of a call, just because the person trying to answer will try to smooth things over before continuing to the details.    There are a couple of issues with Projection TVs that you should also know about.  I've sold TVs in the past year or so but not any longer.  1.  Bulbs are considered consumable items by the manufacturers in, most but not all cases.  Therefore any claim about an item which is expected to be "used up" is usually not covered unless it can be proven that the unit is actually defective.  2.  You will probably be asked about "dirty power" or fluctuating power service in your neighborhood.  For a projection TV the rise and fall of electrical current to the unit can wear out a bulb very quickly.  Most standard power stips only have a fuse when the power is too much or comes in a surge.  For an HD it is always best to get a surge protector which also says explicitly that it will level the power as well.  These obviously cost a bit more than a just a row of plugs but it can prevent the loss of a bulb prematurely which as you probably know can cost hundreds of dollars.  3.  You will probably be asked about the brightness settings and if you've tried turning them up or not.  If your bulbs have gone completely out. then this is a mute point, but if they have merely gotten dimmer then this decay in brightness is not unnatural.  Same with the previous point an inconstant electrical current can make the dimming process go faster than it should.  If the brightness is all the way up and there is still not enough light to enjoy the picture then yeah you do have an issue.  If it can be fixed with turning up the brightness (even to max) then you wouldn't have an issue in the eyes of the manufacturer.  4.  All manufacturers make lemons so I would not, attribute this problem to Mitsubishi specifically.  When you decide to stick with just the manufacturers warranty, it is basically an unspoken agreement that you will go through all the extensive negotiation with whatever customer service the manufacturer has set up IF you should ever have a claim.  For TVs more than other electronics and for projection TVs most of all, I always suggest a service plan from the retailer, because not only do they replace bulbs (and have a professional come to do it) in many of their protection plans, but their way of handling claims is primarily on the level of satisfaction and not whether an item is technically funtioning or not although there will have to be anactual problem to fix.  Retailers also work on a local level and since coverage is elective (and paid for) the staffing is so much better for customer service in general.

AqWRI3G5aa	i hated both of them when i first saw them, but now after looking at numerous pictures over the course of the 2 days they have been out, i have grown to love their stupid shape and old lady grandma sweater colors. the pastel is not going to sell! at first glance, the color selection looks horrible, but it looks better once you consider that the girls could get all the colors and guys choose from black, red and silver. unless they are gay and get the baby blue and weird green|`|8RHw1ZbNaa	light green|`|LfFjXRRjaa	i think the green is rather strange. but i like the new colors. i'd get the red if i werent getting the itouch|`|rrX983kraa	Blue

ZT1Q1wVgaa	Hello,  I just had the same problem last week but it seems like so many people had this problem with this specific song!    This should fix the issue:  - if you're using iTunes right click the song and "convert to AAC"  - clear the 'mp3' version of the song from your iPOD and put the AAC version on your iPOD.  You could tell which is which by right-clicking the song and selecting "Get Info".  In the "Summary" tab you can see the file type.  MPEG is mp3 and AAC is AAC :)    make sure you have the AAC version for "Flo Rida" on your iPOD and not the mp3 version or it'll skip and stop again! :)    This solution worked for me and I'm sure it'll work for you as well.  Good Luck   Dean|`|GJFBsG62aa	I have the ipod touch, and the same thing happens with me. Maybe Apple hates "low"...Wierd though, because "Low" was  1 on iTunes for almost 5months...Its a conspiracy maybe lol.|`|fP05qJ26aa	i have the same problem on my ipod nano and downloaded it from limewire.  where did you download it from and what ipod .If i were you i would just buy it or forget about it and download a different song from flo rida like elevator.|`|GqHXUGmuaa	where did you download it from?|`|0sDjlH5aaa	Did you download it off iTunes, or something else, off iTunes it should work, I have it, and it works fine, off something like Limewire it might not if you downloaded a bad version.|`|DgWHZhGKaa	it happened to me too. just try some of the versions on limewire b/c i eventually found one that worked.
Iza1LDzmaa	Get a new one completely free (with this trick that I show you) at:  http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=43244526  Use this link which is my referall link to get a free ipod. Just sign up for this website and pick the cell phone offer. NOW HERE'S THE LOOPHOLE- After you get the 2nd message just text back "STOP" and you'll have completed this offer for free. Then get 5 other people to do this and before you know it you'll have your ipod touch for free. This is a legit website that has been featured on CNN and BBC(if you want to youtube it you"ll see.) Most people say that if it sounds to good to be true then it is, but this is for real.|`|493s44V4aa	Sadly you can't do anything about it. There was a dateline episode on this and Apple cannot do anything to track the ipod. sorry bro... :(
UHgAacBfaa	u cant do that.... unless u go to apple, report it stolen?
Oi6r3gamaa	warranty only covers the guarntee the product isnt defective, and will work for a set number of years, and will be replaced if it is their fault if its faulty, broken, badly made. it doesnt cover things we have done to it like loss, damage, opening it up etc|`|AA10173862	the warranty does not cover "loss" but if you bought it with a credit card like Amex, they may cover the loss or theft.|`|oQrIn41zaa	I don't think the warranty covers the iPod if it's lost, it does if it's broken, but contact Apple ? and see if they have anything to say.|`|UHw7Vc3Faa	I doubt the warranty covers a lost ipod.|`|AA12180951	you should go and ask best buy.|`|R8mm8eHPaa	Ask best buy but most probably warranty doesn't cover a lost iPod.|`|YJtoH3DIaa	no they dont give you another off waranty for loss or destruction by fire.
Q3Zo8iJEaa	They will not replace it (for free at least) if they found out you opened it.  I dont know how they tell if you opened it or not.  If you bought it in Christmas 06, the manufacture's warranty is expired, because the warranty is only extended three years for the three red lights problem, not other malfunctions.|`|Q1gDTT2Zaa	i believe the warranty on all x boxs has been extended to 3 years but u should call 4MY XBOX on your phone....thats customer service that handles all that|`|aTU2OeOKaa	Yes.  I'd say "Get it fixed".  But probably not for free :(    ?
b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	Here's a link to the manual - http://www.theusermanualsite.com/manuals...    Import's an option under "File" in After Effects - I don't think you can capture the video that way, though.
EHSTiVBPaa	you can put them anywhere but i use a new folder to put new app's in.  then just open the .jar or .jad what ever comes first and it should install

P61gg2F3aa	dont spray paint it just buy a colourful cover or my friend had bought like this dimond sticker thing that covers the ipod and it is especially made for ipods it looked really good but it was from hong kong lol. i have a ipod classic sliver and its been pretty good so far.|`|eAcbEkXlaa	my friend used red touch up paint for a car...     it looked awesome.   another friend just painted it with hot pink nail polish|`|JB8iDli5aa	I have never heard of that, but before you buy the classic check out the new nano.  It comes in multiple colors and is amazing.  You may think it is too small, but watch a video on it before deciding.|`|PS2LKjGpaa	if you wanna change the colour, you can buy ipod skins. They are like stickers.  You can check it out at:http://www.gelaskins.com/|`|b8x5xO3Kaa	Its not a good idea to spay paint your iPod....But a good alternative is getting a nice color case. I've seen one that is just amazing and looks as though the iPod is actually blue or green or pink or some crazy pattern.  There is also a website where you can get disigns to put on your iPod. (Not so sure where that is...google it maybe?)  And I'v had 3 generations of iPod: the 1rst Gen, the 3rd Gen and the 5th Gen video. I loved them all and they all lasted me at least 5 years each. Go for it :D    Hope it helped :D    Links: http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPa...  http://www.iskin.com/evo4_overview.html|`|H5LPNnRNaa	Colorware. I've never actually ordered any of their services. But it looks like they do good work.     You can either order them colored, or buy one, and send it in.
AA11182485	It has built in wifi it will connect it self.    More Info:    www.unrealgamerz.net/forum|`|ImvZFu7naa	go on to network settings scan 4 ur router then follow wt it says on the screen|`|AA11514979	There's countless threads about this.  I know, I've answered a lot of them.    Connect your PS3 to your laptop (may require a crossover cable, not sure, as I haven't tested this myself).  Connect your laptop to the internet.  Go into Network connections.  Highlight the wireless broadband connection and your ethernet connection.  Select Bridge connection.  Your PS3 should now be able to connect to the internet.    When you want to stop, select unbridge.

Efzn69W7aa	The best way to find out whether it is or isn't Vista compatible is to visit the game's main website.    It seems as if it will work with Vista.    Double check for yourself.    www.google.com -- Type The Singles: Flirt Up Your Life and it will take you to the website.|`|WGYaZCx0aa	The game would usually say Games for Windows on the top of the cover if it was windows vista compatible otherwise it could work but you may need to change the compatibility of the program (like if it works for windows xp pick windows xp as the compatibility program for it)|`|32VdZ322aa	im pretty sure that game will work..... unless it runs with DOS(super old games)...... coz all of my 2000 to 2007 games are all workin with vista......
6CFIgPgoaa	it depends on your dvd player, some player doesn't need burned dvd, but if your dvd player does supports DIVX for sure it will be playable. even the format .avi .mpg will be playable you don't need to convert it.|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	DVD's usually need VOB files, and it should automatically play on insertion.|`|YXDtXMTSaa	There are basically 2 types of DVD's you can make that will play on TV through "most" DVD players. Data DVD and Video DVD.     Converting video files to DVD MPEG  does NOT guarantee that it will play, it is how the DVD is burned that makes the difference. DVD MPEG files can be burned directly to a DVD as a data file, but you will not have any menu features or autoplay. Basically, on the players that will play DataDVDs, you would use the player's remote control arrows and enter buttons to open the MPEG file, and if your player can read MPEG files, it should play.    VideoDVDs, when converted and burned, use a unique combination of file types (IFO, VOB, etc) and combine them in an "Image" or ISO Image, which is then burned to enable menu configuration, autoplay, chapter segmenting and other typical "store-bought" DVD features.    There are MANY software providers that provide VideoDVD burning capability, popular among them are Nero, Adobe Premiere, Ashampoo, AVS, Roxio.    .
