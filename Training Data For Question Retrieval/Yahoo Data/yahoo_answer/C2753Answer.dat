vWsIQO9daa	Well for starters, how about trying the following:   1 Cleaning your room and making sure that it STAYS clean and tidy.   2 Making sure that your homework is done and handed in on time.   3 Sweep the floors in the living room and kitchen without your parents asking you to.   4 Wash and/or dry the dishes.   5 Do not fight and argue with your sisters & brothers.   6 Eat what you are given and don't whine or make "yuck" faces when given it.   7 Don't talk rudly to adults   8 Always share with other kids.   9 Go to bed when you are told to.   10 Research the pet and breed you want to be 100% certain that it is the right one for you.    11 Ask them about getting this new pet in a nice way and don't beg and whine about it.

I wouldn't recomend them as first time dog owners.     here is some info:    The Shar Pei or Chinese Shar-Pei is a breed of dog known for its distinctive features of deep wrinkles and a blue-black tongue. The breed derives from China. The name (, pinyin: sh p; English name probably derived from British spelling of Cantonese equivalent s pih) translates to "sand skin," and refers to the texture of its short, rough coat. As puppies, Shar Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these wrinkles disappear as they "grow into their skin". Shar Pei were once named as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by Time magazine and the Guinness Book of World Records, and the American Kennel Club did not recognize the breed until 1991.    The origin of the Chinese Shar-Pei can be traced to the province of Kwun Tung and has for centuries existed in the southern provinces of China. These dogs helped their peasant masters in various tasks such as herding cattle, guarding the home and family, and have proven themselves to be qualified hunters of "wild game, usually wild pigs."    The Shar-Pei is believed to have shared a common origin with the smooth-coated Chow-Chow because of the blue-black mouths and tongues, possibly the Great Pyrenees, a source of the double dew claws, and the Tibetan Mastiff. It was believed in ancient times that the dark mouth of the Chow-Chow, exposed when barking, helped to ward off evil spirits. The first Shar-Pei may have appeared as a mutation. The Shar-Pei when translated means "sand-skin" or "shark skin." This uniquely rough, loose, prickly coat enabled the Shar-Pei to wriggle out of its opponents grasp while fighting in the dog pits. The coat when stroked against the grain may be abrasive, producing a burning, itching sensation. Their tail is carried over their backs on either side exposing the anus. The first tail set is a tightly curled tail, a "coin" tail. The second tail set is the loose curl, and third is carried in an arch over the back. The Shar-Pei with his tail sticking out straight or between his legs was thought to be cowardly. The tail should denote bravery.    While viewing the body head on, if the toes were slightly turned out this was thought to help the dog with balance according to old-time dog-fighting fanciers. The Chinese crawling dragon with his feet pointed east and west was considered a sign of strength. Because of these poor breeding practices many of the Shar-Pei have bad fronts. A dog with straight forelegs is correct.    Incidentally, any dog in China that protects property is called a fighting dog, whereas in Canada and the United States they are referred to as guard dogs.    Following the establishment of the Peoples' Republic of China as a communist nation, the dog population was virtually wiped out. If not for the efforts of Matgo Law of Hong Kong, the Shar-Pei would not be here today. Due to his dedication to the breed, a small number of Shar-Pei were brought to the United States in the 1960s and early '70s. In 1974 American and Canadian fanciers answered Matgo's appeal for help and in 1976 the first Shar-Pei was registered. The foundation stock brought over from Hong Kong were of poorer quality than the Shar-Pei we see today. In August of 1991 the Shar-Pei officially completed the requirements for recognition by the American Kennel club and was placed in the Non-Sporting Group. In 1992 the Canadian Kennel Club also officially recognized and grouped the Shar-Pei in group 6, Non-Sporting n g events. Since that time several Shar-Pei are now and continuing to become CKC and AKC champions.    Together the United States and Canada can now boast over 100,000 Shar-Pei in the world. This unique breed is also recognized by the FCI, HKKC, and the CSPCGB. The CSPCGB operates independently receiving no input or influence from the [British] Kennel Club. I would also mention that the FCI recognizes the HKKC standard and not the AKC's at this time, as per its general policy of using the standard from the country of the breed's origin.    |`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	The best place to learn about a breed is through the breed clubs:  http://www.spcgb.co.uk/  http://www.midlandsharpei.co.uk/  http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/173  If you are thinking of getting one, make sure you do plenty of research, they are a breed with a lot of health problems and not all have good temperaments.

There are three coat varieties: horse-coat and brush-coat and a rare bear-coat, which is not recognized by the AKC.  The bear-coat, does not falling within AKC standard because this particular Shar-Pei has an undercoat and a topcoat exceeding 1 inch.  The popular theory about the bear-coat is that it's a "throwback" to the chow-chow.  They are actually quite popular as pet quality Shar-Pei, albeit rare, and often confused with the chow by unknowing owners as well as animal shelter workers.  The unusual horse-coat is rough to the touch, extremely prickly and off-standing. The brush-coated variety has longer hair and a smoother feel. The coat on either variety can be up to one inch in length. Coat colors include all solid colors and sables. There is also a lowered, spotted, and a parti colored Shar-Pei coat, which is a disqualifying fault in the show ring according to AKC standard. The small ears fall forward and the tail is carried in a curl. Like the Chow Chow, these dogs have a blue-black tongue. It has a square profile with a broad, full head and wide, padded muzzle. Puppies have more wrinkles than adults. Shar-Pei slowly loose their wrinkles as they get older.    Temperament   The Shar-Pei is very loyal to his handler. It is an intelligent dog that does not always follow orders slavishly. Playful, active, dominant, and brave. They bond with their family, but are not unfriendly toward strangers. If the dog meets cats and children while it is still young, it usually will not have a problem with them. The Chinese Shar-Pei has a frowning expression, but is surprisingly easy-going, calm, independent, and devoted. They make a delightful companion and good watchdogs. The Shar-Pei needs a confident handler. If you are uncertain, inconsistent, too soft, or mild, in the dog's eyes, it will take over as the boss. Shar-Pei need a firm, but gentle, extremely consistent authority figure. The dog must be taught all humans are below him in the pecking order. They are stubborn and bold and need firm obedience training to establish your leadership. They may refuse commands from family members who have not established leadership over them. They need an owner who as the ability to be "Top Dog". These dogs are very clean and almost housebreak themselves. Shar-Pei generally hate water and try as hard as they can to avoid it. Puppies grow very quickly and must be fed accordingly. Mixing other dogs can sometimes be a problem if one of the dogs is displaying dominate behaviors. Socialization is important. However some Shar-Pei are less dominant then others and show lines tend to be less dog-aggressive, mixing well with other dogs. Some Shar-Pei tend to slobber, especially when in pain. It is important to find a reputable breeder when seeking a Shar-Pei. This breed was very popular in the 1980's. It was referred to as one of the "Yuppie Puppies", meaning the breeds that were carelessly over-bred. The dogs temperament depends on how the owner treats the dog. Dogs who are allowed to believe they are the boss over humans will developed behavior issues. Dogs who are not taken for daily pack walks will also begin to display a varying degree of issues. A lot of this breeds health issues depends on the lines it comes from. Good Shar-Pei lines will not have skin problems, which is a hereditary condition.     Height, Weight   Height:  18-20 inches (46-51cm.)  Weight: 40-55 pounds (18-25kg.)    Health Problems   Fevers of unknown origin or swollen hocks syndrome may be the early stages of amolydosis (kidney failure). One misconception is that the Shar-Pei have skin problems due to their wrinkles. Yes some Shar-Pei have skin problems, but it is not because the dog has wrinkles, but rather a hereditary condition. Due to over popularity in the 1980's, some Shar-Pei do have hereditary skin problems. However if you buy from a reputable breeder, this conditions will not be a problem. Be sure to find a breeder who strives for healthy dogs.    Living Conditions   The Chinese Shar-Pei will do okay in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. It is moderately active indoors and will do okay without a yard. Because of their padded head, the Shar-Pei is very sensitive to heat. Shade and water must always be available. Provided they get enough exercise, they will be very peaceful indoors.    Exercise   The Chinese Shar-Pei have a considerable need for exercise, which include a daily walk. Do not over exercise them in the heat, as they are sensitive to it.    Life Expectancy   Up to 10 years.    Grooming   The Shar-Pei should be brushed regularly. Their coat is never trimmed. This breed does not have an undercoat. The "bush" coat sheds a little year round, but the "horse" coat tends to shed only during molting periods. Molting may leave the dog looking unkempt. Bathing about once a week and brushing the coat daily during this period wi|`|i7WJdKUqaa	The Shar-Pei is playful, courageous, dominant, and energetic. By nature, they are very loyal to their owner. They are an intelligent breed that does not respond to commands slavishly. If properly trained and socialized from an early age, they generally get along well with cats, children, and strangers. Despite the breeds frowning expression, they are easy-going, calm, and devoted. They are great watchdogs and companions. Because they are stubborn and bold, they need firm, consistent training from an assured owner. This breed usually despises water, and they will do anything they can to stay away from it. They are clean and often housebreak themselves. Because they have been so over-bred, there are significant differences in personality and health. The temperament of these dogs will vary according to their lineage. Well-bred Shar-Pei lines will get along quite well with other dogs.    size:18  20 inches  weight:40  55 pounds    their health The Shar-Pei is susceptible to hereditary skin problems.

JwYwsrTzaa	I don't believe there is an age limit, but the sooner the better. It is quite easy to have them removed when puppies are first born, but the longer you wait will make it harder and more complicated for your dog and the longer the recovery time will be.    I had a bull terrier who had both sets of dew claws and never had any problems.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	There can't be.

The vet told me that as they age the removal becomes more complicated and dangerous.  I just let him keep them.  One note of caution, however.  One day I came home to find him on the floor unable to move because he had gotten his back dew claw stuck in the round ring of his collar.  He was wise enough to stay put, but after that I never left him alone with his collar on.|`|qPPBcWoDaa	It is easier on the dog to have the dew claws removed at a young age.  If a puppy did not have them removed when they were a few days old, it is best to have them removed when you have the dog spayed/neutered.    You can have them removed if the dog is older put know that it is harder on the dog and takes a longer recovery.  The surgery is more intense and takes much longer to complete.  The longer the "toe" is on the dog, the more cartilage forms and has to be cut into/removed.|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	It should be done when pups are 5 days old.Less hassel then.Older dogs tend to be distressed if you wait til older.|`|775UzN5Jaa	No there is not an age limit, but many people decide to remove during spaying and nurturing or during the first week of life, since they are more like fingernails instead of appendages. Be warned, if u do it during spaying and nurturing the recovery time will be longer  |`|n66jWHWsaa	Preferably, it is best to remove the dewclaws when the puppy is between 3-5 days old.  The procedure at that time is extremely easy and fast and the puppies act as if nothing has happened within minutes.  It is also the time when the tail is docked (if it needs to be for the breed).  After that time, the surgery is much more difficult and extremely painful for the dog.  It basically turns into the equivalent of you having one of your fingers cut off.  The only exception to this is if the dewclaw is on the rear leg and is not attached by any bone, just skin.  Those are much easier to remove and recovery is simple and less painful for the dog.  The best time to have any dewclaws removed that were not done when they should be is when the dog is spayed or neutered so they only have to risk the anesthesia once.  The only reasons to even have the dewclaws removed is if it is the standard for the breed (for show) or for a hunting dog (or any dog) that has an greater potential to possibly get them caught and torn.

She could remember when she was a puppy if you or someone else yelped when she would play bite to teach her not to bite.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	because she cares about whether or not she hurts you? If you tend to make high pitched noises while you're playing, she could think you're yelping.
AA10053661	pssssssssssst.......it's asking you to stop. *shrugs* sorry.|`|AA10937078	The dog hears your howl as a communication, not as a source of pain.  Ever join a "howl in" as a wolf sanctuary?    If you howl loudly, you dog is answering in kind.  They are singing along.    Maybe your lyrics are off color and what your dog is doing is howling in laughter.|`|AA11786965	No! They are singing along! Fun times!|`|AA10992635	Howl all you want.  The dog is just imitating you.  I'd worry more about what your neighbors might think!  lol|`|AA12260782	I personally think they are singing along.|`|AA11121653	The dog thinks you're choking and is really laughing at you.|`|013d120b54c6c34e8397f25e31ef586aaa	No silly YOU are the alpha dog, they are just following you. Unless you have a really bad voice.|`|d0837c72c592dde94aabe62fb7bd3cdcaa	no, it does not hurt there ears they are just singing with u, it is kind of cool. i live in the country and have 2-springers and when the coyotes howl they howl with them, it is really cool to listen!!!!!!!!!!|`|e1d6570a59771e218ce7d61f81b29538aa	no it doesnt hurt them they are singing with you|`|AA11260537	put your self in a dogs place. wouldnt it hurt u? :)|`|207fcb073ed14a6baf5a8e7972f8ac6caa	Some loud sounds can hurt a dog's ears, but most frequencies that hurt a dog's ears are unheard by humans. I'm sure you've heard of dog whistles? Same concept. Other sounds like screaming, yelling, fire engines sounding, fire crackers all disturb dogs, because they're loud & startling sounds.  Of course if your singing is bad...just kidding. I had a Cocker Spaniel who would sing along with me. But my Lab would shake like a leaf if I yelled, even if I was just yelling at the television.  It depends on the individual dog. Perhaps a lullabye for your dog?
krXQaZAfaa	Actually, dogs can get Upper Respiratory Infections/Viruses which hold many of the same symptoms as a human-type cold.  Runny eyes, nose discharge, congestion in the chest/lungs.  Kennel cough can be compaired more to pneumonia in humans.  Hope this helps!|`|4PCRX4sUaa	dogs do get the common cold (and Kennel cough is a more serious dog illness)...it's just that when your dog has a cold you may not notice becuase maybe you work outside the home and aren't always around to notice that he's sleeping more or sneezing often...don't get me wrong -on average they don't get sick as often as we do; the reason for that may be because they have a stronger immune system than we do - they live in nearly controlled environments with a limited number of different people/dogs they have access to (compaired to you) plus they have a stable diet unlike humans and there is never a reason for them to not get a good nights sleep|`|2xRMYebnaa	The "common cold" for us is a general term describing similar symptoms that are caused by hundreds of different viruses.  The same with the word "flu" there are thousands of different viruses, bacterium, and protozoa which can cause similar symptoms... but we give it all the same name.    Some species of viruses are "host specific" meaning they only like humans, or cats, or dogs, etc.  Some are "Zoonotic" which can be transmitted between humans and other animals.     The viruses that cause flu or cold-like symptoms in dogs are mostly host-specific. So the virus that has attacked you just "passes through" your dog... it doesn't stay and cause trouble. Viruses that cause runny noses, coughing, sneezing, fever, aches, watery eyes, diarrhea, and lethargy in dogs are similar, they are being shed, but just pass through you because you do not have a canine body.  If a sick dog were to enter, however...    -RVT  (Registered Veterinary Technician)|`|WK3Q7FR2aa	Our colds and viruses are not zoonotic (not transferrable to canines or felines).  Kennel Cough is very similar to our cold, just doggy form...the vaccination Bordatella is available at your vet clinic (normally required for grooming and boarding). Dogs (mostly your small breeds) have a collapsing trachea (tracheal bronchitis) that causes a lot of coughing when the pet gets excited or his collar is pressed against his neck.|`|AA10984760	I think the closest thing dogs have to the common cold is "kennel cough." It's contagious and is spread through other dogs' sneezes and coughs. It's highly common in dogs who come from the pound because of their close proximity to so many other animals. Kennel cough generally lasts about a week, much like the common cold, and can even lead to pneumonia. I learned this from the Humane Society when I adopted my beagle last August.|`|533cbd5eb0dd99b30a5f8427d0b02ac8aa	Kennel Cough would be like our common cold, but with dogs it takes them a while to get over it.  Our 2 year old dog had it and it took about 2 weeks.  The vet told us the only thing they could do is give antibiotics, but that doesn't really help a cold any.    Miraculously, our 11 year old dog (who sleeps right next to our 2 year old) didn't get it.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	"More recently, dogs have been attacked by flu. Dog flu is a more recent phenomenon, and has been first diagnosed in racing greyhounds in Florida. Dogs are usually down with fever or cough and fever. A runny nose and pneumonia are some other symptoms. Since this is a relatively new phenomenon, most dogs do not have the immunity against the virus that causes it. Inherent immunity from genes is also not present. On the sunny side, most dogs catch the milder form of the flu, and recover within a fortnight or so. The more severe form is a little complicated. It starts with cough, and then proceeds to fever. The dog may also suffer from pneumonia. This is caused by secondary bacterial infections that attack the natural respiratory lining within the respiratory tract, thus making the dog susceptible to other diseases.

You should thank your stars that you baby has not gotten a cold or anything else.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Dogs just don't contract human cold viruses.  Lucky them!

4R34sXT2aa	Bonsoir,    En-dehors d'une maladie ou d'un malaise passager (?a peut aussi arriver), votre minette peut avoir quelque chose qui la gne pour respirer, un morceau d'os ou autre chose de coinc dans sa gorge.  Ce que vous dcrivez ressemble  quelque chose comme ?a en tout cas.     J'ai dj vu un de mes chats faire la mme chose.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I vacuum the substrate and remove some of that messy stuff at every water change. Leaving it be will just cause it to destroy your water quality. You can clean the plastic plants every time too.    For an average stocked tank (most tanks tend to be fairly heavily stocked) needs this done once a week, with a water change of around 20%.    For an understocked and heavily planted tank you can get away with once every two weeks - not many tanks are understocked though sadly.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I say vaccuum once a week or once every other week if you want to be thorough.  Don't make too much noise though if fish are in the tank.  Moving gravel around creates vibrations that are the equivalent of gunshots to us.|`|4SBfe9Tpaa	1/yr|`|N0N4v34Oaa	I vacuum everytime I change the water, just for an added effect of clean. I don't think it's bad to vacuum the gravel regularly. In fact, I'm sure it's pretty good for the fish anyways, so if you have all your tank cleaning supplies out, why not?  As for the plants, you can really clean them whenever you feel you should. Some fish like to pick off the algae from the plants, but it's not their mainstay diet, so you shouldn't worry about that.|`|tTsMMhCaaa	You should clean a fish tank once a day. If you have more than one fish, put them in a filled and clogged sink. Pour or filter out the water in your tank. You should see that there are strange remains of food and fish dung at the bottom with the rocks. Roll up your sleeves and put disposable gloves on. Pick the residue up gently, so it doesn't break apart and go back down again, and drain them in a sink (not the one your fish are in). Once that is done, fill your tank back up with water. Pick up your fish gently and put them back into your tank. Put the tank back where it was, and you're done! Hope this helps!|`|ncG5SQ2aaa	You should never remove the fish from the tank, unless absolutely necessary. I would do a water change of 1/4 to 1/3, (while vacuuming the gravel) and then replace with preconditioned water. Leave the water in a clean bucket with water conditioner for about 3 hours to make sure it has been dechlorinated and all the harmful tap water substances are gone. Then put the water back in your tank, and tada! I would recommend doing this once a month, maybe every 3 weeks depending on what kind of fish you have.|`|emr9t1Ymaa	about twice a month thats what i do|`|PaMbD6lFaa	once a month|`|3VHNW1Z5aa	clean it once a month thats what i do, take the fish out first tho.... never good to start scrubbing when the fish are in lol    but if you cant be bothered cleaning once a month you can get a filter wchich cleans the water and keeps the tank hygeinic constantly...but they do cost
KdLhlP3Yaa	Join a local barn that shows often or find a trainer that has lived there for a length of time she should know about shows in the area. Look at online events or find your local park and recreation website and they should list all the up and coming events too.|`|ZOkEvufKaa	there are some shows out here.  go to snhja.com or go to my website www.foxtailfarm.net or go to talismanfarmlv.com  you should find more information there....
sgr01OCkaa	first of all, in the fourth picture, I think your seat looks generally ok and your arm position is almost perfect, there is a good straight line from your elbow down the reins to the bit and it is good to see that you are looking ahead towards the next jump. as for the jumping one, don't throw yourself forward by standing up in the stirrups like you have, its put you in front of the movement. instead, keep your heels down and bend more from the hips and knees and maybe take your stirrups up a hole or two.  Also you should try to keep your toe about even with the front of the girth, your feet have come back slightly. keep your seat above the seat of the saddle, not in front of it. Your butt should only come an inch or so out of the saddle in order to maintain better contact with the horse. Also relax your shoulder, and allow your arms to be more 'elastic', it looks a bit like you are fighting to hold this horse back, when you are approaching a jump that's fine (you dont want her to rush), but once you are about two to three strides out you should give her her head and let her do what she needs to. It also looks like you are leaning your weight on your horses neck. It is ok to hold onto the neck to assist with a rein release and help you balance but you shouldn't be holding yourself up by her neck, by keeping your seat back this should help though.   as for the horse, it would be good to see her use her shoulder more to bring her legs up better and more evenly underneath her. Because you are restricting her head and making her top heavy by throwing yourself forward it is hard to get a picture of her jumping ability properly because I cant see how she would use her neck and I think if she had proper use of her neck her jumping style would make a prettier picture and allow her to arch her back more.  she is a beautiful mare, she has a nice eye and I think you and her could make a good team.|`|1oOGAY8caa	Beautiful horse! :)     I noticed that your hands/arms are behind you.     http://www.horsegroomingsupplies.com/pic...    If you look at her hands/arms, they are going with her horse. You want to think of reaching towards your horses ears. A good trick for this (and releasing) is to grab mane as your horse comes up as you go over the jump.     I used to have major problems releasing over jumps, so my instructor told me to grab mane and hold myself there. Now, I wasn't putting my weight on my horses neck, just using it as a guide.|`|nKwcGLQraa	while jumping: shorten stirrups a hole or two. hands forward, elbows in! butt closer to the saddle (you should kinda be "bending" forward and just lifting your butt off the saddle to let your horse work with its back, not trow yourself over her neck cause it will get her off balance and front heavy makign it harder for her to jump).    very nice mare though :). i dont knw how high she would be able to jump though. she has a nice build though.|`|XL62syrCaa	You are too far forward in your seat and need to shorten your stirrups so that your hips are more bent. Your want the same "seat" when you are in two point as you have in the saddle. And she looks like a good mare!|`|nI8G21y8aa	beautiful mare, work on your posture|`|5rEWdAuxaa	She is a beautiful mare and if you work well with her she would be great for you. You do look like you are too far forward but when you find a suitable trainer that can be easily fixed with some training. I always try to do the jumping position at a walk, trot and canter on the flat as that helps my posture heaps. She looks a little over weight, or is that angle of the photo. Lovely head and sloping shoulders and not a deep back. Very nice. I would buy her if you worked good with her and share a partnership. I reckon she could jump a little more maybe 50 cm or more if you slowly introduce the new heights and get her going quickly before the jump.|`|gzQAIahaaa	You need to work on your posture and position, you should be able to hold yourself up not leaning on her neck for support. I'm glad you're not doing dressage look at her head and neck in the 2nd last one!    Beautiful mare though.

iyFw76shaa	I used to kick to get my horse started too but it really isn't the right thing to do.  The legs are supposed to be cues, not weapons.  Either get yourself some spurs, or what I do is carry a little quirt (whip?) that has a loop that fits on my wrist.  You can also just use the end of your reins if they are long enough.  I try hard not to use my legs to kick but I confess that it is a hard habit to break.  You say that you tried a crop but you didn't say why that didn't work.  Does he still kick when you use the crop on his flank?|`|sY7g3ttPaa	In my honest opinion, i believe that the circumstances call for a certain airplane manuver, exicuted precicly at this moment.

I guess it is nothing to do with the bowl...      Hope this help...|`|v1tePj44aa	If you leave him be he'll eat...|`|zF8H7THFaa	I would suggest considering the new food you've put it on.  Is it what the breeder was feeding or something new?  He may simply not be adjusted to the taste if it's a new food.  Another option would be the food is bad and he knows it.|`|gOecCNDdaa	Since you recently got him he is just getting accostumed to his new diet, with a different brand of pellets. Call the person who you got him from and ask if you can have a small sample of his other food so that you can combine it with his new food for at least a week until he gets used to it.   Most breeders will usually send you home with your bunny and a small sample of the food they have been using.      If you bought him from a breeder who has pedigreed rabbits or shows their rabbits then the bunny is probably accostumed to a higher percentage of protein in their pellets because these breeders try to give them the best food to keep their fur looking good. I recommend buying pellets with at least %14 of protein in it.|`|XDvTZo4xaa	How does the pellets look? They should look a nice rich green colour not a brownie green colour. Maybe it's not the freshest bag or brand for that matter, try switching but look for a nice healthy green colour. Rabbits can be a bit fussy sometimes, as long as he's eating his hay and veg that's the main thing there diet should be more hay then pellets anyway particularly when they get older as alfalfa based pellets are fattening. |`|qLCFxeBzaa	Hi....I've been raising and showing rabbits for 10 years. Most rabbits will take at least a few days to adjust. If he doesn't eat within a few days then try getting some Calf-Manna (its actually for cows) from Tractor Supply or a feed mill and sprinkle it and mix a little bit across the top layer of his pellets. A very small amount, 1 or 2 tablespoons max. It has a licorice flavor that rabbits love and it helps entice them to eat and can be used to help put a little weight on them. Also, is this a new feed or a the same one the breeder was using? It can cause them to have diarrhea if just switched all of a sudden instead of a gradual change. Which to switch a rabbit to a new feed, its best to mix 3/4 the old feed and 1/4 the new for a couple days, then 1/2 and 1/2 for a couple days, and 3/4 the new feed and 1/4 the old, etc... The best diet for a pet rabbit is a good quality timothy pellet feed with 15-16% crude protein from a reliable store like TSC or a feedmill. Hope this helps and please feel free to contact me with any more questions.

I've been bit by a Polmeranian, that doesn't mean I think they are aggressive or tempermental? no, its LACK OF TRAINING.  Regardless of the breed, dogs that bit are at the fault of the OWNER for not training correctly. Dogs are followers and humans should be the pack leader, if that is not estabilished the dog takes the pack leader responsibility.    In nearly ALL cases the owner did not live up to their responsiblity.  Some of the most friendly dogs I've met are pit bulls, german shepards, boxers and rotts AND I've been bit by a Lab...**      They are very powerful dogs that require a well trained owner.  They are loyal and usually very gentle with children.  You must demand respect and always be the pack leader with them.  If you need info on them because you are considering buying one, I'd suggest you ask yourself the following questions    1) Are you committed to constant training  2) Can you walk the dog at least 15-20 minutes a day  3) Do you have children or other dogs that are untrained?  4) Are you a natural leader or a "push over"?  (no push overs here, unless you can change)  5) Do you a a fully fenced in yard where no one can enter without you knowing.    For more info on this breed visit: http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/akita....|`|AA10515694	:o) I have an akita that is about 11 years old. I've had her since she was a puppy (about 11 weeks). If you are not familiar with this breed, be aware that you are very much behind the 8-ball, and have a ton of learning to do to be a good and responsible owner.     Akitas are very smart, and very hardheaded. There is an old saying, "begin as you intend to continue". That is sooooo very appropriate when it comes to these critters. If you let them jump up on you when they are 3 months old and weigh 20-30 pounds, they will still do it when they are 3  years. You need to condition them to accept touch and manipulation so that you can do things like clean their ears when they are older and check their paws for stickers and such, AND so that your vet can give them their annual exams.     They have a tendancy to be very protective of their core family, and will often stand guard between them and anyone they percieve to be a stranger. Again, they need to be taught how to be appropriately protective, because you don't want problems when you have someone come in to make repairs. They also have a tendancy to be agressive to other animals. Do a lot of socialization with them, and then if this becomes an issue (it did with mine at about 10 months) just be prepared to adjust how you do things. For us, that meant when we were out on walks, she was required to sit and stay when being passed by other animals, and we would give them a wide berth in order to avoid problems.     Akitas are very clean, almost cat-like, and rarely get that doggie odor with proper grooming. They do shed a lot. In some places they will use their fur to spin into a yarn and make garments out of it.     IMHO, akitas are wonderful pets, but they do take a consistant, patient, and firm hand. Especially when they are young, so that when they are older, they already know their boundaries.
AA10781889	Kennel Cough In Dogs  ...also called Canine Cough, Bordetellosis and Infectious Tracheobronchitis    Read about the newly emerging disease called Canine Influenza... also called Canine Flu    Kennel Cough in dogs will stimulate a coarse, dry, hacking cough about three to seven days after the dog is initially infected.  It sounds as if the dog needs to "clear it's throat" and the cough will be triggered by any extra activity or exercise.  Many dogs that acquire Kennel Cough will cough every few minutes, all day long.  Their general state of health and alertness will be unaffected, they usually have no rise in temperature, and do not lose their appetite.  The signs of Canine Cough usually will last from 7 to 21 days and can be very annoying for the dog and the dog's owners.  Life threatening cases of Kennel Cough are extremely rare and a vast majority of dogs that acquire the infection will recover on their own with no medication.  Cough suppressants and occasionally antibiotics are the usual treatment selections.    WHAT IS KENNEL COUGH?  Actually, clinical cases of Kennel Cough are usually caused by several infectious agents working together to damage and irritate the lining of the dog's trachea and upper bronchii.  The damage to the tracheal lining is fairly superficial, but exposes nerve endings that become irritated simply by the passage of air over the damaged tracheal lining.  Once the organisms are eliminated the tracheal lining will heal rapidly. The most common organisms associated with Canine Cough are the bacteria called Bordetella bronchiseptica and two viruses called Parainfluenza virus and Adenovirus and even an organism called Mycoplasma.      HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED?  The causative organisms can be present in the expired air of an infected dog, much the same way that human "colds" are transmitted.  The airborne organisms will be carried in the air in microscopically tiny water vapor or dust particles.  The airborne organisms, if inhaled by a susceptible dog, can attach to the lining of the trachea and upper airway passages, find a warm, moist surface on which to reside and replicate, and eventually damage the cells they infect.      The reason this disease seems so common, and is even named "Kennel" cough, is that wherever there are numbers of dogs confined together in an enclosed environment such as a kennel, animal shelter, or indoor dog show, the disease is much more likely to be spread.  The same is true with the "colds" spread from human to human... they are much more likely to occur in a populated, enclosed environment such as an airplane, elevator, or  office.  All it takes for contagion to occur is a single source (infected dog), an enclosed environment, and susceptible individuals in close proximity to the source of the infection.  Infected dogs can spread the organisms for days to weeks even after seeming to have fully recovered!    NOTE:   Even in the most hygienic, well ventilated, spacious kennels the possibility of a dog acquiring Kennel Cough exists. Kennel Cough can be acquired from your neighbor's dog, from a Champion show dog at a dog show, from the animal hospital where your dog just came in for treatment of a cut paw...  Try not to blame the kennel operator if your dog develops Kennel Cough shortly after that weekend stay at the kennel!  There may have been an infected dog, unknown to anyone, that acted as a source for other dogs in the kennel.    Many dogs will have protective levels of immunity to Kennel Cough via minor exposures to the infective organisms and simply will not acquire the disease even if exposed.  Other dogs that may never have had immunizing subtle exposures will be susceptible to the Bordetella bacteria and associated viruses and develop the signs of coughing and hacking.    HOW IS IT TREATED?  Many dogs that contract Kennel Cough will display only minor signs of coughing that may last seven to ten days and will not require any medication at all.  The majority of dogs with the disease continue to eat, sleep, play and act normally... except for that annoying, dry, non-productive coughing that seems so persistent.  It is always a good idea, though, to have any dog examined if coughing is noticed because some very serious respiratory diseases such as Blastomycosis, Valley Fever, Heartworms and even cardiac disease might display similar sounding coughing.  Your veterinarian, through a careful physical exam and questioning regarding the dog's recent environment, will be able to establish if the dog's respiratory signs are from kennel Cough or some other respiratory insult.    Treatment is generally limited to symptomatic relief of the coughing with non-prescription, and occasionally prescription, cough suppressants.  If the dog is running a fever or there seems to be a persistent and severe cough, antibiotics are occasionally utilized to assist the dog in recovering from Kennel Cough.  It can happen that secondary bacterial invaders will complicate a case of Kennel Cough and prolong the recovery and severely affect the upper airway.  Therefore the use of antibiotics is determined on an individual basis.    HOW IS IT PREVENTED?  Many dogs, exposed to all sorts and numbers of other dogs, will never experience the effects of Canine Cough.  Some dog owners, though, prefer to take advantage of the current vaccines available that are quite effective in preventing the disease.  Usually these dog owners will have to board, show, field trial, or otherwise expose their dog to populations of other canines.  Since the chances of exposure and subsequent infection rise as the dog comes in close proximity with other dogs, the decision to vaccinate or not to vaccinate varies with each individual circumstance.  Generally, if your dog is not boarded or going to field trials or dog shows, you may not have a high level of need for vaccinating your dog against Ke|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	Stop buying antibiotics for one thing.  There are many causes of kennel cough both bacterial and viral.  If she still has it, she is not being helped by the antibiotics. And overuse will hurt her in the long run by killing off the natural flora in her digestive track. Just stop buying them.  Assume she has a viral kennel cough. It will take up to 4-6 weeks to go away.    If it isn't gone in that time period you need another evaluation from the vet.  The breeder shouldn't have lied to you in the first place. It is possible the dog caught it from a vaccine that the breeder gave her or just from the other dogs there.    And I would disagree that it would be a good idea to vaccinate the other dog now.  She is already exposed to the disease.  Don't make it worse by exposing more from the vaccine. She could catch a different strain from the vaccine itself then spread it to the sick dog. Just leave everything as is and wait for it to pass.  It's like a virus in a daycare setting.  Eventually they all become immune and it will pass.|`|CCgfJ3tjaa	a few more days  a week most   get in touch with a pet  and try to isolate your dog from others|`|25df0d9e852a343d355fcb6e2f8c75edaa	My German Shepherd bit someone and had to be quarantined for 10 days at the pound.  I got him back with kennel cough, and had the same concern as you because I have another dog.    Kennel cough did not go from one to the other because they were not cooped up.  I read all I could find and it all said it lasts 2-3 weeks and that treatment was not recommended unless the dog seemed to be showing greater illness.  It lasted a hair longer than 3 weeks, but it did go away without treatment.    As you got the dog on 6/2, this does not sound like kennel cough to me (as if I have some vast experience).  There are only so many anti-biotics a vet can give without killing an infection -- if the infection is something that can be killed.      My best guess at this point is that it is either a chronic condition and the possible reason the dog was available for adoption, a viral infection that will require a change of environment to clear up, or an allergy of some sort that may change with the seasons or with a change in environments.    I don't think I'd buy any more anti-biotics at this point.    Hope this helps.|`|7nEW6rhbaa	Puppy shots are not immediatly effective the day they get them, or even the next day.  Kennel cough can take up to a month, sometimes more to clear up.   Make sure she is eating healthy etc.. hang in their with the medication. Has your other dog been vaccinated for kennel cough?  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...  I am sure you Vet is proffessional and will change medications if need be
AA12107238	At some point you have to let her go.  As hard as it is, if he quality of life is not good and you can not financially keep up the treatments for it to be good you need to euthanize the animal.  Tough decision, I am sorry for you and your long time friend. |`|zeTGmB3faa	Speak to your vet about the quality of your cats life. Does your cat act healthy? Is he drinking and eating well? this is what you need to think about. Many of us have had extra expenditures with our pets, but this is  part of pet ownership. These are decisions that you and the veterinarian should discuss. Best wishes.|`|RsXJfFp0aa	ok if the medicating isnt helping  call the vet they will know what to do and  keep giving your cat the medicans untill the doctor  say to stop or  gives you something  different to  give  your cat good luck  best wishes to you and  your cat!|`|Qw7ymfakaa	I totally understand where you are coming from.    If she was tested for skin cancer could it then be treated ?  If not then i wouldnt bother.

kRssUlazaa	YES!!!! Rats smell terrible if you don't clean thier cage at least once a week. I have a gerbil,(FYI gerbils are half rat and half mouse) and he gets really smelly. His fur get really greasy but I found just about the best product on EARTH! It is a powder that you sprinke on them a couple times then they automatically shake it though their fur and it gets the grease out. It is called Super Pet "Critter Bath Powder". And I did potty train my gerbil. I use litter called Super Pet "Potty Litter" and it works really well. Just to let you know when I say smell I mean they smell like pee!|`|IFGSOd16aa	Rats do not smell bad. at all! people think that because hamsters but its not true<br>  i own 2 and there the best!!<br>  <br>  they are loving and sit right on my shoulder!!<br>  <br>  they can be trained just like does.<br>  i have hamsters the bite :(<br>  rats practically never bite!!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	My boys have soft, pet-able, clean fur. It isn't fluffy or fuzzy. It's more like a short-haired dog's. (I can't compare it to a rabbit's fur. I was six when we had bunnies, and I really don't remember much.)<br>  <br>  I find that rats themselves don't really smell. I have two boys, one who is intact and one who is neutered. The neutered boy is completely odorless, while the intact boy does have a faint musky smell if you press your nose against him. <br>  <br>  It's their cage that has an odor, if you fail to clean it often. That smell is, of course, the odor of animal urine and feces. It isn't strong, though, if you maintain cleanliness.<br>  <br>  What do you mean, how should you cage them? Rats are best housed in large wire cages. The wire must be powder-coated; galvanized will quickly be damaged by the urine and will be very stinky permanently. The cage must contain no less than two cubic feet of space per rat, so for a pair, you'll need a cage that is *at least* four cubic feet, and that's tight. Babies and females must be in a cage that has bar spacing of no less than 1/2 inch, as they can fit through very tiny spaces. Adult males and very large females can be kept in cages with spacing of 1 inch, if necessary. <br>  I'm personally fond of Martin's Cages.<br>  <br>  Yes, many can be litter trained. Rats are generally clean animals who prefer to relieve themselves in specific corners of the cage, and that's where you put the litter box, which should contain a litter that looks clearly different from the bedding. Then just place any stray droppings in the litter box. There are some rats who never take to litter-training, and some who aren't completely reliable. Some can be litter-trained in a week, and others may take a few months of consistent learning. A good litter is Yesterday's News; do not use clay-based cat litters!<br>  <br>  There really are too many tips to cover in a Yahoo answer, so I completely recommend that you check out the <a href="http://www.goosemoose.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.goosemoose.com</a> forum. It's literally brimming with information, and there are plenty of topics that answer a newbie's questions. Seriously, go join, you won't regret it.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh my God, "gerbils are half rat and half mouse?" That literally made me laugh out loud. That's ridiculous. A gerbil is a gerbil. They're native to the deserts of Africa, Asia and India and were first imported to North America in the '50s.|`|9QekHkhfaa	my rats dont smell and i have 2 of them. their cage it self smells, cause i dont clean it often enough. yes they can be litter box trained, a large cage, rabbit size, but make sure the bars are no wider than 1/2 an inch apart or they will squeeze through it|`|2oS5qZq3aa	my best friend has 2 female rats <br>  their hair looks like the guinea pigs hair but it doesn't smell<br>  their cages don't smell unless you use an aquarium <br>  yes, they can be litter box trained but it takes a while since they are not very smart<br>  there is a very important thing that people have to know <br>  rats can make very good pets but ALL rats carry at least one disease <br>  which is not good for humans<br>  they are very aggresive<br>  if you don't feed them they will eat each other or they will bite you<br>  really hard that it will make you bleed<br>  im not saying that rats are bad pets<br>  they can make awesome pets<br>  my fried loves them and hers are very nice and playful<br>  remember to never leave them without food or water<br>  and always play with them<br>  <br>  good luck|`|51St5GEcaa	anyone with a rat who smells is not raising it properly. My rats have no scent and neither does their cage. If you keep a litter box in their cage, they will eventually poop in it, so every time you clean the cage you clean everything but the litter box, so they realize that's the place to go, and then you have litter box -trained rats! They are very clean and very smart. <br>  <br>  And definitely don't smell at all, as long as you train them and clean the cage once a week, and provide a shallow dish for them to bath in every so often|`|xaRyvznHaa	yes, they smell. If you clean them out about every week. And try to take out a lot of rat droppings about everyday that will reduce their oder. They do not have much hair, and im not too sure about litter box training you can try, but i've never tried it and if i did im sure i would be hard, considering they poop a lot. Yes they are like mice but bigger, not a great difference. I would put them in a big cage with a good amount of room, not too much, you don't want to spoil it, lol. Make sure it has a big weel. Do *not* get the cage that is metal and has the weel *attached* to it. My hamster got its head cut off with a cage like that and its just a big piece of CRAP.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. <br>  <br>  :)
AA11304279	Sit with her in your lap and be petting her with one hand and use the other hand with the brush in it so as you are petting her you are brushing her. she will then associate you petting her with brushing and it will be postive. It will take many times to do this but don't hold her down if she tries to run cuz then she will get a negative feeling about it. If she quirms then let her go and then go back and get her and then do it over again. when you go and get her have the brush in hand. Also let her sniff the brush and dont move it away from her fastly that will startle her and she will feel like its a threat.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	if she doesn't need brushing don't do it. if she is long haired then try to do it gently for a few minutes and then a little longer and keep going|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	Does it really matter that your cat gets brushed only to pacify your selfish wishes of you wanting to brush it?|`|Y3xQzZEWaa	Brush her everyday so that she gets used to it. My cat had the same problem, but now he tolerates and enjoys the brush.|`|6ofRCkLAaa	It sounds like she's afraid of the brush. I would suggest leaving the brush in plain sight, so that she can see it, and get used to it.   Or perhaps brush her for as long as you can and then give her a treat, and soon she'll start to realize that if she lets you brush her, she gets a treat.   Hope this helps!|`|w316jSfcaa	you should give her cat treats while you brush her...soon she'll see the brush and think "Hey!! I'm going to get treats"|`|YlDp0Ikwaa	Maybe you should try a differnt brush if the one you are using isnt very good.  i give my cat a brush once and awhile too, i useually keep the water going to make him think hes still in the bah works for me!      =] jackiee|`|nNLMZ7uraa	are you brushing too hard cats skin is more sensitive than dogs or ours give her a treat (cat nip or somthing she likes but does not get all the time ) when she does stay for the brushing let her know its a good thing.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	Try a different brush with soft bristles.     Then when it comes time to brush her, take a treat and just brush her fur, keep giving her treats. When she notices the brush give her a different, better treat.    If this doesn't work, try petting her and giving her treats, letting her see the new brush and sniff it.    Also, try using cat nip, and put it in your hand. Give it to her when she is calm with the brush and she knows it is there.    Don't make a big deal out of brush time.    Just buying a new brush might be enough to get your cat to be Ok with brushing, but I doubt it.      I hope I helped, good luck, tell me the outcome! :)
18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Gelding a 6 month foal is pretty severe. I would have waited until he was a yearling before making that decision.    He'll be terribly lonely and your adult horses will probably beat him up. He's just barely weaned and will try to nurse anything that resembles an adult horse. AND he's new to the herd - any new horse to an established herd (even if it's just 2 horses) will be subject to the pecking order - and he'll get beat up a lot.    I'd put him in with the miniature donkeys - but watch him closely so he doesn't get too beat up by them as well.    But what really concerns me is the early gelding. Wow.|`|74e11e68b5d4a93adef3bdaaea7c5eb2aa	well my first answer is a yes, however you want to make sure that your horses are not going to rip apart each other. otherwise he should be fine if your horses are not very aggressive, we always had babys out in the pasture with ours we just took the one horse out that always caused the problem.|`|TUco8dDaaa	I would keep him with your donkeys as the other horses may try to start a pecking order with him.  He is a bit too small to fend for himself.    You could try and put him in with the rest but watch them carefully to see how they all react to him.    To be safe though, I would keep him with the donkeys and only with the other horses if you are there to watch.    Good Luck with your foal!|`|WgZ7bebNaa	I would put him in the pen with the donkey, but maybe move them to a pasture beside the horses if that is possible.  That way intruding him to the horses is a lot easier because they recognize each other.      I am also worried about him being gelded so early.  I'm guessing though you bought him from an auction, and that is why.  If you know could you maybe shed some light on this.

y8HyP1bzaa	I'd say that would be a good idea, as long as you have enough room.  Especially if he is alone all day, it would be good for him to have a companion.    If you end up doing this though, I recommend getting a kitten or a young cat instead of adopting an adult.  Introducing an adult into a home with an already established adult is like "trespassing on his turf."  A kitten is much less threatening.    Best of luck!|`|rmLrVrAHaa	Its a great idea to get a companion. I got my first cat almost 2 years ago. I felt bad that she was always home alone while I worked all the time so I got her a little buddy. Well .. now lets just say I have 3 cats instead of 1. lol.    Just make sure if you do get a new family member you dont rush the introduction. Introduce them slowly. There are many books and articles over the net you can read on how to introduce a new pet into the home.     Its worth it.. def. worth it. I love my babies more than anything.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	It's a good idea having two cats so they can play together and have something to do when you are gone|`|FBhjhjR0aa	with your place being 600 sq foot, the smell from the liter with 2 cats would be over powering. Just get him some toys, or leave a radio or tv on while you are gone. as long as they can hear someone, they are fine.|`|7955ec36986076dc3013a66eaf3fd877aa	well im not sure if he would like it... kinda depends on the cats personality. but cats are very territorial so it might not go to well...
AA10368524	If it's safe for humans it won't poison your dog, but is it practical to spread it all over your dog? Just keep him inside. Teach him to go on a newspaper.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Unless it states on the container that it is safe to use on pets or animals, I wouldn't use it on my dog.|`|2a6f5d805ecd07579b35f24fb39ece2eaa	just because it's safe for humans most certainly does not mean it's safe for a dog.  dog's aren't human.    to be on the safe side just call your vet.  they will be able to help you.  products like frontline and advantage have a mosquito repellant in their product and are made for and safe for use on dogs.  they also protect from fleas and ticks as well.|`|85F6C8Rnaa	uhhm..maybe not so good thats only for humans??!!

Just because it may be safe for humans to use does not always mean that animals can use it as well.  You need to call your dog's veterinarian and ask about some recommendations for mosquito repellent for your dog.

UvPUopA8aa	No, I think it's cruel to declaw any animal. Do you know what the procedure entails? It's pretty invasive believe it or not, it's more than just removing the nails it's the amputation of the first joint in their toes. It's best just too keep her nails trimmed & wear a long sleeve when you hold her. 8)|`|3Tqfmtxwaa	Would it be cruel to rip your fingernails out? <br>  <br>  Just clip or file them.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Yes, it would be cruel, No it can not be done.  Just keep them trimmed.  And, BTW, it is INCREDIBLY cruel to declaw a rabbit as their nails are weight bearing.  NO VET who has ANY clue about rabbit anatomy will consent to the procedure.  They end up walking on the end of the remaining bone in their toes (the whole first bone is removed), and almost always wind up in severe pain the entire rest of their life, with open sores on the skin covering the area.  They do not have pads on their feet like cats (and declawing cats is really quite cruel anyway, even if they are not in as much pain as a rabbit afterwards).|`|FRakQHszaa	You'll need to cut her nails, but you should never declaw any animal.

Vai dal veterinario; anch'io sarei stata propensa a dire che ha le pulci o forse un problema di forfora e cutaneo , causato dal pelo (io ho un certosino che si gratta  molto, anche a sangue, ed  dovuto al pelo troppo fitto che lo fa dannar, purtroppo nn c' rimedio, il pelo fitto  una caratteristica di questa  razza ), ma anche un'alimentazione troppo ricca di proteine pu causare degli attacchi di prurito.    ciao e una carezza alla  tua bella|`|XSCiF6HNaa	Lo f anche la mia, ma quando vuol esser al considerata,( spero cos anche per la tua), poi la prendo in braccio, la faccio giocare e le passa, ciao|`|SUk7IgQlaa	La prima cosa che viene da pensare  senza dubbio un problema di parassiti,perch non esegui un trattamento specifico per parassiti esterni e non solo quello specifico per pulci.Le ragioni del prurito possono essere molte e forse sarebbe meglio consultare un veterinario per risalire alla causa|`|ef673ea62e5c842e3393d0d4479a237aaa	potrebb essere dermatite|`|UZaNlkxzaa	Ciao! Non saprei ma non mi sembra una cosa molto normale... So che i cani fanno cosi o perch sono affetti da vermi.. o perch soffrono per le ghiandole perianali. Forse vale anche per i mici..

Il collare a strozzo non serve a nulla perch se il cane non viene educato a caminare civilmente continuer a tirare per tutta la vita perch quella  l'unica forma di condotta che conosce. Ti consiglio  di leggere questo libro  "Guida pratica all'educazione gentile del cane. Un nuovo metodo per educare con dolcezza il nostro cane" di Capra Alexa, Robotti Daniele (Prezzo:  27.89) e in caso di fallimento di rivolgerti ad un addestratore cinofilo (solitamente la Protezione Civile organizza corsi di questo genere a prezzi contenuti); l'addestratore in realt addestrer te a capire e a farti capire dal tuo cane.  Ciao!|`|wke3wrd3aa	dipende se il cane e' cocciuto allora si ma se no ...  dolcissima nn farmi mai male anche se lo sgridi devi solo alzare la voce!!|`|pfPTRQFtaa	ma ke domande fai??? meglio educazione gentileee !!!|`|A78NgnBaaa	dipende dal cane e dal suo carattere  devi prima studiarlo i primi giorni come si com porta  ci sono cani che non hanno bisogno di maniere forti,altri si  non bisogna mai esagerare  cani da circo non ne vogliamo vero?|`|kUBKdjpHaa	Niente metodi gentili! tortura il tuo cane! lol! scherzo! non lo farei mai!    Prima di usare qualche metodo devi sapere che i cani sono animali che vivono in branco e di conseguenza riconoscono all'interno del gruppo un solo leader.Quindi a casa tua tu sei il leader e il tuo cane  un tuo sottoposto, detto cos sembra un po' brutto, ma  cos, usando piccoli accorgimenti (tipo:quando apri la porta devi passare prima tu e poi lui/lei) l'animale riconoscer te come suo capogruppo.  Con un po' di pazienza e molto amore riuscirai ad insegnargli/le molte cose.  Io per esempio al mio cane ho insegnato a sedersi e a darmi la zampa a comando dandole come premio dei biscotti.Pu sembrare una cazzata, ma c'ho messo pi di un anno. Cane svogliato!|`|1536ee63bf762c9e0b8beded3c59c004aa	..ehmmm senza ombra de dubbio l'educazione gentile facendo ben capire la differenza dei s e dei no semplicemente alterando il tono della voce ;)|`|wWFhYucaaa	 molto pi efficace il metodo gentile, dolcezza e tanta pazienza!|`|JOLqB0eyaa	penso ke con gentilezza si ottenga di pi....|`|sOwURgnOaa	Sono entrambi molto "efficaci".    La differenza  che con il primo il cane non vede l'ora di eseguire i tuoi comandi perch sa di farti felice e di ricevere in cambio le tue carezze, mentre nel secondo caso esegue gli ordini perch sa che se no poi viene strozzato e ha paura e terrore di essere maltrattato.    Il mio parere su quale sia il migliore penso sia piu che ovvio.|`|WSshj48qaa	io sono per l educazione fatta con amore e tanta gentilezza piena di coccole e magari qualche bel no o un pochino di indifferenza ma odio le botte e soprattutto quelle diavolerie di collari a strozzo ma mandano fuori di testa quei diavoli di addestratori che sembrano prendere gusto nello strangolare i nostri e i loro amici per fargli capire chi comanda e se lo facessimo a loro............i nostri amici nn sono stupidi qualche strattone con dolcezza gi basta e avanza e nn considerarlo e anche meglio.................bacioni da zio Rex amato e coccolato|`|a7By2PZtaa	ma che collare a strozzo! i metodi "gentili" nn servono a molto ma nn devi neanche "pestarlo".. credimi che per loro un tuo "no" cn un "brutto" tono fa + male che uno schiaffo!!!|`|7yFHMUPIaa	Il metodo gentile senza dubbio. I collari a strozzo sono comunque di diversi tipi; i cosiddetti collari a strangolo, che sono deleteri e provocano tracheiti certe. I collari a strozzo veri e propri sono anche di corda e possono essere efficaci. Io, come laureanda in Tecniche di Allevamento del Cane di Razza e Educazione Cinofila, ti consiglio senz'altro di abituare il cane a camminare al guinzaglio con l'aiuto di crocchette.

Se le risposte sono positive ci si pu chiedere di che razza (o non razza) dovr essere il nostro amico a 4 zampe. E per scegliere con coscienza e responsabilit  bene studiare attentamente gli standard di razza nella parte in cui si parla di carattere. Se siamo degli sportivi non  il caso di prendere, ad esempio, un bull-dog che soffrirebbe per gli sforzi fisici causati da lunghe corse. E poi valutare bene anche lo spazio che abbiamo a disposizione (un alano o un S. Bernardo in un monolocale sarebbero.....un p ingombranti!!!!). Scelta la razza (o non razza) e portato a casa il peloso........pazienza, calma, coerenza e tanto amore!|`|ZDhixeB9aa	ahahahahaha gestisciti in modo che il doghs ti gestisca...|`|WSshj48qaa	tanto amore tanta buona pappa tante uscite con tanto di giochi e soprattutto tanta pazienza.........bacioni zio Rex|`|qbcD61F9aa	Dalla consapevolezza che il cane non e' un giocattolo e dall'amore , dalla pazienza e dal tempo che si e' in grado di offrirgli!|`|5h3o0dtaaa	ALIMENTAZIONE: Da piccolo Crocchette per puppy 2/3 volte al giorno coi dosaggi indicati nella tabella informativa a seconda dell'et e della mole. Attenta ai cibi freschi, poco latte finch  piccolo ma poi eliminalo perch da problemi intestinali. Se vuoi preparargli tu da mangiare allora pasta/riso senza sale o olio con carne o pesce bollito, magari una carotina da sgranocchiare per i denti. Mi raccomando, le crocchette di una buona marca (non Frieskis) sono l'alimento pi completo, te lo dir anche il veterinario.  E mi raccomando, non mischiare durante la giornata crocchette e cibo fresco, se inizi col le crocchette allora dagliele anche la sera, se invece cominci col cibo fresco continua con quello.    LAVAGGI: niente lavaggi prima di aver completato il ciclo di vaccinazioni (di solito intorno ai 4/5 mesi) e di solito non pi di 3/4 lavaggi all'anno, 5 se vuoi essere pignolo. Per pulire il pelo tra un bagno e l'altro usa salviette per cuccioli o acqua e aceto per lucidare il pelo e togliere i cattivi odori.  Mi raccomando, non va lavato spesso, gli provocheresti dermatiti, il veterinario pu confermare. 2/3 volte l'anno, al massimo 4!!! Se  cucciolo poi aciugalo bene perch potrebbe ammalarsi, magari per il primo lavaggio portalo da una tolettatura cos si abitua subito a Phon e tronchesine per unghie.    VETERINARIO: Contattare subito un veterinario per un controllo generale e per fissare gli eventuali richiami dei vaccini. Magari fare anche un controllo delle feci per vedere se la sverminazione ha avuto successo e un prelievino per la filaria (tra un po' dovrai gi fargli l'antifilaria perch siamo quasi ad aprile). Mi raccomando, vai all'anagrafe canina e fatti dare il microcip cos tuteli il tuo cucciolo ed anche te se ti scappa o altro. Costa pochi euro e il veterinario si occuper di metterlo al cucciolo.    DENTI: intorno ai 4 mesi il cucciolo comincia a cambiare i denti, compragli ossa di bufalo per aiutarlo, intorno ai 6 mesi dovrebbe averli cambiati tutti. Per tenere i denti sani e puliti (ed un alito fresco) esistono dentifrici e spazzolini per cani, di solito si lava 1/2 volte a settimana, ma se ti  pi comodo esistono prodotti per l'igiene dentale che il cane pu sgranocchiare, alcuni sono aromatizzati. Prendi per prodotti per cuccioli finch  piccolo.    PELO: Tieni il pelo spazzolato, compra una spazzola adatta al tipo di pelo del tuo cucicolo. In questo modo eviti di dover raccogliere palle di pelo in giro per casa e il cucciolo sar felice di essere accudito. Infatti il pelo morto pu dare fastidio al cane, soprattutto nel periodo della muta, verso primavera.    BISOGNI: All'inizio ti far un po' di bisogni in giro per casa. Se lo fa e lo cogli in flagrante allora sgridalo (senza alzare le mani) e fagli capire che non lo deve fare, poi portalo fuori a fare i bisogni. Per i cuccioli sono consigliabili almeno 3/4 uscite al giorno, di cui una anche per giocare e socializzare. Da adulti ne bastano 2/3.    IN CASA: Evita di farlo salire su divani o sul letto perch il cane ragiona per gerarchia ed in questo modo si sentirebbe superiore al padrone. Infatti, nel branco, il capobranco sceglie dove dormire, se gli concedi il tuo letto  come se gli dicessi "Ok, sei tu il capobranco". Il tuo cucciolo deve imparare a rispettare le gerarchie, se cerca di scavalcarti non permetterlo perch potrebbe poi darti problemi da adulto.    Per il resto dagli tanto affetto, fallo giocare con altri cani, abitualo alle situazioni nuove un po' alla volta (tipo macchina o centri commerciali.. in macchina  probabile che vomiti se non  abituato, lasciagli il finestrino un po' aperto per annusare). Se sbaglia fagli capire che ha sbagliato senza sgridarlo o picchiarlo, se  bravo premialo (biscottini per puppy), in questo modo dovrebbe imparare in fretta quali comportamenti evitare.|`|bbJiqWZdaa	io ho iniziato col raccogliere i suoi bisognini in tutti i punti della casa, poi ho conosciuto insieme a lui questo meraviglioso mondo.......|`|Yxcb4G04aa	Dal averlo!!!

Ebbene quando sono arrivato a casa, mi sembrava che quasi piangesse, da quanto mugolava e fischiava, il regalino naturalmente non l'ha degnato di uno sguardo era tutta unicamente per me.. la prima notte ha voluto dormire accanto al letto sul tappeto, cosa che non fa mai perch il suo posto  infondo al letto dove ha la sua brandina.

Mi piace fare colazione ed osservare quei corpicini cosi piccoli che mangiamo  cosi  felici di trovare del cibo buono e nutriente.  Immagino che un animale che vive con noi diventa come una persona speciale che ci fa tanta compagnia e da anche tanto amore.  Io credo che anche gli animali hanno una loro anima e sono convinta che c' un mondo speciale che li attende.  Ti auguro di superare questo momento di tristezza e di sconforto con coraggio e devi pensare che  stato un gatto fortunato perch ha trovato una padroncina che le ha voluto tanto bene.  Credimi con tutte le crudelta' che vengono inflitte su animali anche se ha vissuto solo tre anni ha vissuto nell'amore di una casa calda e accogliente.  Un abbraccio di cuore!!!|`|1bd923f06c9cde1cc57ee684b51c2faaaa	mi spiace moltissimo.... anche io ho perso il mio adorato gatto amonra... ecco perch ho scelto questo nick...|`|uV3vu2kzaa	mi dispiace molto per il tuo gatto, spero che il tuo dolore possa andar via il prima possibile, ciao

Ciao baci|`|a9dace56fe075035bc608d08fffa41baaa	che si sta innervosendo... al contrario del cane che scodinzola quando  contento il gatto manifesta il suo nervoso, l'agitazione muovendo la coda...|`|d1a883971996622015a44b23a825537aaa	il mio gatto lo f quando  agitato|`|7bc852bb0c421dcf6cac5b7517f5d0e4aa	La maggioranza ritiene che se il gatto dimena la coda vuol dire che  arrabbiato, ma questo non  del tutto vero!!!!   la risposta esatta, secondo autorevoli etologi tra i quali Desmond Morris, e che il micio in quel momento si trova in uno stato conflittuale, vorrebbe cio, fare due cose contemporaneamente e non sa quale scegliere.o, peggio ancora, gli  impedito scegliere.   Se ad esempio un gatto miagola che vuole uscire e appena gli avete aperto la porta, si accorge che piove a dirotto, con tutta probabilit si fermer sulla soglia agitando furiosamente la coda. Se poi decider di uscire ugualmente, rientrer, di li a poco, bagnato fradicio e sicuramente agiter la coda ancor pi furiosamente di prima. Poi, appena risoto il conflitto, smetter di dimenarla. Stessa cosa nel caso che lo si accarrezzi quando  in procinto di dormire. di mangiare o semplicemente quando si sta avviando in un'altra stanza.  In casi come questi non  giusto dire che  arrabbiato, poich la rabbia implica un impulso represso ad attaccare, ma non c' alcun pensiero aggressivo nella mente del gatto quando si accorge del temporale o mentre si sposta da una camera all'altra.   Semplicemente quando in lui due desideri sono egualmente forti, il gatto non sa bene a quale obbedire e manifesta il proprio dubbio dimenando la coda!!  Ciaoooomiao a tutti!!!!!.|`|1478341fde951a7bc7346e7852fc335faa	Significa che  agitato e nervoso...se la tiene alta invece  contento.|`|936cdf4cf75afc75d37a84862a588584aa	intendi a scatti? che gli stai martellando le palle, e che  meglio che lo lasci stare! la mia gatta lo fa spesso, ha un caratterino tutto suo, se insisto fa finta di mordermi e poi mi lecca! poi se insisto ancora si alza e va in cantina nel suo scatolone preferito, se la ronfa o si lecca e poi torna a cercar coccole!!!!|`|beec4850e04acc34969938ddb7d4bc20aa	Quando i lgatto muove la coda vuol dire che qualcosa gli da fastidio, qualcosa che non va...E la cosa diventa sempre pi grave in base alla velocit.......Invece quando la coda  ferma vuol dire che tutto va bene...|`|af999da6f59d04ab2dddb14bb094d40baa	che  nervoso (paura?)mentre il cane quando muove la coda dice che  ok(voglia di giocare?)  amico.da qui le incomprensioni fra i due.|`|a06e1a45c0db2196e0112bd6dc92ed6baa	trattasi di orcociclosi felina.... ovvero gli girano le cosiddette..... meglio smettere di rompere...|`|9f0c259a8ade4c2200f4dd6f2b71c938aa	Che e' agitato....Che belli i micini!|`|926da2c60c106802218f5c515f930a40aa	dipende in che modo la muove, ogni movimento ha un suo segnale... difficile  troppo lungo a spiegare in chat. cmq. non    un brutto segno|`|49cca780588fa28ef63925f17591a0b4aa	significa ke  arrabbiato o deluso,geloso...|`|a93610c2b021fe265eac5a74dcfcf44faa	che si sta incazzukkiando....    e che probabilmente ti sta preparando un attentato.... ^ ^    ...Libero di Essere...|`|131143846a14d4787b850d24d13d30b7aa	Significa che in quel momento  abbastanza agitato, cerca di capire quando capita qual' la situazione che in quel momento lo destabilizza.Cerca di rassicurarlo, parlandogli con dolcezza....Con la mia gattina funziona.

Ammazza, e che : un mostro orrendo!  Chiunque salverebbe il cane, mi sembra lampante.  Stellina e bacio.|`|yS6hKX1naa	e chiedi???ovviamente il cane =)=)=)  baci|`|1fz25WbSaa	la risposta a questa domanda  scontata   il cane|`|8mt3cHk9aa	Che discorsi sono? Un essere umano  pi importante di un cane. Salvo l'uomo. Poi lo porto al commissariato.  Un non salvare un uomo potendolo fare  un assassinio.  Mi spiace per il cane ma non se ne parla: questo  buon senso.  --  Cara Malinconoia, rispondo pubblicamente alla mail che mi hai mandato che incollo qui:    "Da: malinconoia87  Oggetto: *  Messaggio: Un essere umano  pi importante di un cane.   FAI SCHIFO , FAI SCHIFO TANTO QUANTO UN PEDOFILO (gia' tanto x stare in tema)"    Non  dato a nessuno di farsi giustizia da soli. Ho detto che salverei l'uomo e che lo porterei al commissariato dove potr essere sottoposto al giudizio di un tribunale che, spero, dovrebbe essere l'ergastolo.  Non sono un paladino dei pedofili, se potessi li strozzerei tutti con le mie mani. Sono padre e lo farei con chiunque provasse ad avvicinarsi a mio figlio.  Stavo solo cercando di immedesimarmi nella situazione descritta. E' facile fantasticare su vendette, ma la realt  un'altra cosa. Per me un cane  un cane e un uomo  un uomo. E' la mia opinione, non intendevo offendere chi la pensa diversamente.  E se al posto del cane ci fosse stato un topo chi avresti salvato? O uno scarafaggio? Vogliamo fare una scala di valori di tutti gli animali? Io salvo comunque l'uomo senza pretendere di giudicarlo come se fossimo nel far west.  Se veramente vivessimo in una societ dove ci si pu far giustizia da soli andremmo tutti in giro armati sparando al primo che ci  antipatico.  Allora secondo te bisognerebbe ripristinare la pena di morte? Magari la ghigliottina?    Fatti una camomilla e datti una calmata ok? E non mi scrivere pi.    --  Malinconoia insiste a disturbarmi nella mia mail:  "Da: malinconoia87  Oggetto: Re: *  Messaggio: scrivo a chi mi pare e piace soprattutto se si scrivono stronzate."    Mi sa che sei una stupida ragazzina testarda. D'ora in poi non ti risponder pi. Risparmiati di mandarmi altre mail, le cestiner senza leggerle.    ---  Lasciando da parte malinconoia vorrei rivolgermi a tutti quelli che salverebbero il cane.  Certo,  la risposta pi istintiva che viene, sarebbe bello liberare il mondo da un pedofilo. So che  un argomento delicato perch la violenza  la prima reazione che viene per un abuso nei confronti dei bambini. Io stesso ammazzerei di botte chiunque provasse ad avvicinarsi a mio figlio (e in questo caso sarebbe legittima difesa).  Solo che ho provato a immedesimarmi nell'improbabile situazione di poter scegliere tra la vita di un uomo e quella di un cane. Non sono praticante di nessuna religione, quindi non  sentimento cattolico di perdono verso chi non sa cosa fa. Lo salverei a malincuore, con la rabbia dentro di me e con la voglia di malmenarlo.  Immagino di aver collezionato un bel numero di pollici in gi perch questa sezione  frequentata da amanti degli animali. E' facile pensare: ricgiambo difende i pedofili quindi pollice in gi.  Ma io non difendo i pedofili. Difendo la giustizia. Secoli di storia dell'uomo che non possono essere buttati nel cesso per un attacco di sentimentalismo.  Il pedofilo  un malato. E' stato bambino anche lui e probabilmente non ha ricevuto amore. Bisogna difendere la societ da loro isolandoli, ma al tempo stesso la societ  cresciuta in modo tale da ritenere barbara la lapidazione e il farsi giustizia da soli.    Io ho provato a fare un ragionamento serio. Voi fate il vostro, per ragionate prima di giudicare.

iLxrVdWBaa	IL CRICETO    Le due specie di criceto pi? comuni sono il criceto dorato o siriano, Mesocricetus auratus, e il criceto russo, Phodopus sungorus, entrambi Roditori della Famiglia Chcetidi. Sono animali notturni e scavano tane nel terreno. Sono piuttosto semplici da allevare in cattivit?, ma hanno una vita molto breve e quindi sono poco adatti come animali da compagnia per i bambini. Sono in genere docili ma all'occorrenza possono infliggere morsi dolorosi.         Criceto dorato    E' un animale tozzo, con una coda molto breve, dei peso di circa 120 gr.  La colorazione originale ? marrone dorata con il ventre bianco  grigiastro, ma in seguito sono state sviluppate molte variet?: cannella, crema, bianco, albino, ecc., e un tipo a pelo lungo detto "teddy bear".    E' un animale molto territoriale e combattivo con i suoi simili e va alloggiato da solo per evitare lotte e cannibalismo,         Criceto russo    Spesso ? erroneamente venduto come lemming.  E' pi? piccolo dei criceto dorato, pesando solo 30-50 gr, anche se la struttura dei corpo ? simile. E' grigio con una striscia dorsale pi? scura e pelo pi? chiaro sul ventre, anche se in commercio sono presenti molte variet?, tra cui crema e arancio. Anche le zampine e la coda sono ricoperte di pelo.    E' molto pi? attivo e vivace dei criceto dorato e quindi ? pi? difficile da maneggiare. Sopporta meglio il freddo che il caldo, e muore a temperature superiori a 35?C.  E' un animale notturno, ma presenta degli sporadici periodi di attivit? durante il giorno.         Caratteristiche anatomiche e fisiologiche dei criceti    Sono caratterizzati dalla presenza delle tasche guanciali, in cui immagazzinano il cibo da trasportare nella tana.    Quando la temperatura scende sotto gli 8?C vanno in ibernazione; se la temperatura sale diventano rapidamente attivi, quindi ? bene che abbiano sempre a disposizione cibo non deperibile e acqua fresca. I criceti in ibernazione possono apparire comatosi o morti al proprietario inesperto.  Anche i criceti sono coprofagi e assumono direttamente dall'ano le feci circa 20 volte al giorno.         Alloggio    La gabbia deve essere sufficientemente spaziosa da permettere una certa attivit?, a prova di fuga, facile da pulire e priva di punte e margini taglienti. I materiali migliori sono acciaio, plastica dura, plexiglas o vetro, che resistono alla corrosione.    E' preferibile un pavimento solido con abbondante lettiera di materiale che non sia tossico e polveroso, quale carta a pezzetti e trucioli. La gabbia va arredata con una ruota e altri oggetti per l'esercizio, ad esempio piccoli tubi orizzontali e verticali posti nella gabbia, attraverso cui i criceti amano molto correre, e scatole con diverse aperture attraverso cui possano infilarsi. E' molto importante fornire una casetta che il criceto utilizzer? come nido.    Almeno una volta alla settimana si deve procedere ad una pulizia accurata della gabbia e degli elementi di arredo.  I contenitori dell'acqua e dei cibo andrebbero puliti e disinfettati tutti i giorni.         Alimentazione    In natura i criceti sono onnivori e si nutrono di piante, semi, frutta e insetti ? sicuramente sconsigliabile una dieta prevalentemente a base di semi, che sono troppo grassi e contengono poche proteine e vitamine.    La dieta viene integrata con piccole quantit? di cereali soffiati senza zucchero, pane integrale, pasta cruda, carne di pollo cotta, tonno senz'olio, uovo sodo, formaggio, frutta e verdura fresche accuratamente lavate. Acqua fresca e pulita deve essere sempre a disposizione.         Riproduzione    In cattivit? i criceti si riproducono tutto l'anno.  La gravidanza dura circa 16 giorni nel criceto dorato e 18 in quello russo. Nei giorni precedenti e successivi al parto la femmina non deve essere disturbata, evitando di maneggiarla e di pulire la gabbia.    Deve avere a disposizione abbondante materiale per fare il nido (sono consigliati fazzoletti di carta) e una scorta di cibo sufficiente. I piccoli non vanno toccati per i primi 7 giorni di vita.  I piccoli alla nascita sono completamente inetti, nudi e con gli occhi chiusi, ma presentano gi? gli incisivi.    E' opportuno lasciare a disposizione del cibo sul pavimento della gabbia, in modo che sia facilmente accessibile, ad esempio dei pellet inumidito; anche l'acqua deve essere facilmente raggiungibile dai piccoli. I piccoli orfani non hanno possibilit? di sopravvivere.         Come maneggiare il criceto    I criceti sono in genere animali docili, ma soprattutto se spaventati o se svegliati bruscamente possono mordere.    Quindi bisogna essere preparati a mantenere la presa anche in questa eventualit?, altrimenti si potrebbe fare un gesto istintivo che lancia il criceto contro una parete o il pavimento. Inoltre i criceti si lanciano facilmente dalle mani con il rischio di cadere a terra e ferirsi.         Dati fisiologici del criceto    La dentatura dei Criceto ? costituita nel suo complesso da due incisivi superiori e da due inferiori, e da tre molari superiori e inferiori per lato. In totale i denti sono 16. I denti incisivi hanno la particolarit? di essere a crescita continua. Il Criceto presenta due tasche guanciali. Esse consentono la raccolta di grandi quantit? di cibo non masticato, che il roditore manger? successivamente. In corrispondenza della regione del dorso, In posizione lievemente laterale, sono presenti due aree di forma circolare, una per lato, di colore bruno scuro o grigio e prive di pelo. Queste due aree sono ricche di ghiandole sebacee. Nel Criceto domestico, l'ambiente e la temperatura hanno completamente soppresso il meccanismo fisiologico del letargo.    In natura il Criceto vive dai 4|`|4a45d3d10c5bd1cc9a0cf9e908341568aa	si si deve abituare al nuovo ambiente e a te, anke io ne ho uno, uno zaffiro...cmq sia il criceto  un animale notturno... normale che stia rintanato, si svegliera intorno alle 9:00/10:00 e iniziera a girare nella ruota...per i morsi temilo solo se  un "orsetto russo"...sono quelli che morsono di piu...per difesa, appena si abitua non ti fara nulla, ti lecchera in segno di affetto!!!  una cosa importantissima: NON mettere assolutamente all'interno della sua gabbietta una cosa chiamata "nido per criceti" crea problemi respiratori ai roditori...  ...per delucidazioni ulteriori sono disponibilissima!  tanti auguri per la felice convivenza!!!|`|a695e853906417dc715709211db371d0aa	Alcuni hanno abitudini notturne, forse sta solo dormendo: tu tienilo sveglio, altrimenti ti perderai tutta la gioia della sua compagnia, appunto perch si metter a gironzolare sempre e solo mentre tu dormi, ed  un peccato.

Piano anche col cibo: ne vorrebbe sempre di pi perch ha l'istinto di metterlo via, ma alla fine marcisce in un angolo.

Logicamente l'hai portato in un posto nuovo  normale che faccia cos, dagli il tempo di abituarsi alle persone in casa, agli orari e a te soprattutto. Puoi anche invogliarlo porgendogli un seme dalla tua mano. Fa' attenzione perch se morde pu essere pericoloso per entrambi (a me una volta un criceto mi ha morso e dopo due giorni  morto) soprattutto per te perch potrebbe portare delle malattie. Cambia la segatura spesso, e lascia la ruota sempre libera di girare e non preoccuparti se mangia in continuazione o morde la gabbia, i suoi denti crescono in continuazione ed ha bisogno sempre di consumarli in ogni modo possibile, fai attenzione che non vada sotto la ruota, morirebbe asfissiato (a una mia amica  capitato e non ha avuto il coraggio di tirarlo fuori cos le  morto davanti). Che altro dire? Mi sembra che sia tutto.

(sono arrivato a 35 in pochi mesi)  2 di solito esce la notte, gira e gioca  3 memorizza i percorsi quindi se ti dovesse scappare e lo trovi stai sicura che un'altra volta che scappa lo ritrovi li al 99%.  4 assicurati che le sbarre della gabbia siano prive di deformazioni in quanto riesce a infilarsi tre le stesse per scappare e riscapper sempre da li)  5 non ti spaventare se rosicchia le sbarre  normale  6 il primo che avevo era veramente dolce e lo potevo portare persino nel taschino ma l'altro era pi cattivo di solito li accarezzavo sulla testa.  7 per prenderlo senza il pericolo che ti morda fai come i gatti per la pelle dietro la testa  8 si spaventa facilmente e grida se ha paura  9 bagnati un p il dito vedrai che lo leccher senza morderti sentirai solo la lingua molto ruvida  10 non ti conviene lasciarlo girare che spesso lascia i "ricordini" in giro  11 nella gabbia metti dell'ovatta o carta penser lui a costruirsi il rifugio    ciaoooo|`|iFFVj7vGaa	aggiungo una cosa per te e per gli altri che usano l'ovatta e il cotone:  NON compratela pi!! E' vero che la vendono con la dicitura *per criceti* ma pu portare danni gravi al roditore. Si pu attorcigliare alla zampina e farla andare in cancrena. Io la usavo e per fortuna non ho avuto incidenti nell'anno che ho avuto il criceto, ma direi che  meglio evitare. Lo scottex va benissimo, il criceto diventa matto a farlo a pezzettini.|`|F0VXayq9aa	Io ne ho avuti 2. E' normalissimo che adesso non esce ha paura! Lascialo li e tutti i giorni con la mano oltre a i semi che gli dai, (se non hai paura) appoggia un seme di girasole all'entrata della casetta, vedrai che poi si fider di te e uscir. Non dimenticare mai di dargli o un po di insalata o carote o delle bucce di frutta.Ti consiglio (per farlo giocare) un rocchetto di cotone finito o una semplice pallina pazza.

U51F70fpaa	I'm so sorry.  Have you tried looking for him?  Asked your neighbors, put up posters, called the local animal shelter?  You could also try setting up humane traps and putting some of his favorite foods inside to lure him in.  He might be too scared and lost to find his way back, but that doesn't mean you can't go looking for him.    In the meantime, fix the cage.  What kind were you using that was outside and had a top that could fall off?  Outside rabbits should be in large, secure hutches.  They're better off indoors though.  Ask your parents if you can move him inside if you find him, or if you get another rabbit.    I hope you find him!  Good luck!|`|1NYipOpUaa	i cry a lot too new bunny|`|af551a884ff1147dc14dcc7e9071a7d8aa	Thats exactly what happened to me ..and ofcoarse its ok to cry ..pets become part of the family. you should go around asking if anyone has seen him.

Quando crescer  probabile che questa prerogativa salti fuori.  Quando guarisce, chiedi al tuo veterinario se devi continuare a svezzarlo per un paio di mesi.  Per esser una peste  normale, ha 5 mesi e se nn gioca e fa le sue esperienze ora, ti ritroverai con 1 gatto ammalato di noia qndo sar grande. Ti consiglio di andare in un negozio di animali e prendergli magari quei giochi a tronchetto con mensoline e cordine dove si pu arrampicare, giocare e fare tute le sue pazzie. In questo modo acquister equilibrio e padronanza delle sue capacit di felino. Inoltre manterr la sua natura di predatore.  Ti posso consigliare che morirai dal ridere a vederlo far pazzie su un trespolo simile|`|9c3e4e54d4dc5f11972626cc10a3c99daa	Io di gatti ne ho tre, 2 femmine di 4 anni e un maschietto di 1 anno...    Una delle due femmine "fa la pasta" ogni benedettissima sera :-))), gli altri non sempre, anzi! Tieni presente che le femmine sono 2 sorelline, che sono entrate in casa mia che avevano 50 giorni, con tutta la serie di acciacchi che si portano dietro quando adotti un micio di strada il 4 dicembre: pulci, vermi, raffreddore, funghi...    Credo che il "far la pasta" sistematico di Francine (la gatta nera) sia iniziato un annetto f, quando aveva 3 anni: ogni sera mi d la buonanotte con una mezz'oretta di coccole, poi va a dormire ai miei piedi (le taglio le unghie spessissimo, senn mi tortura!)... Josie, la gatta bianca (4 anni) si lascia andare una volta ogni 2 o 3 mesi, capisco che  gelosa della sorellina e del nuovo arrivato.    Tigrillo (il maschio tigrato di un anno) invece la pasta la f pochissimo, preferisce strusciare il muso in segno d'affetto, anche lui arriva dalla strada, aveva 3 mesi e mezzo quando l'ho adottato...     Io credo sia un'indole, che si acquisisce in ogni caso... lascia  che lui venga a cercarti "come e quando" vuole... pian piano acquisir confidenza e magari far la pasta... non dimenticare che ce l'hai da poco e non sai che storia ha alle spalle, i gatti sono gi diffidenti per natura... ma quando si affezionano sono deliziosissimi!!!! :-)))    ciao!

Talvolta basta un sospiro per svegliarli o ancora di pi il rumore di qualcuno che sta mettendo cibo nella loro scodella, altre volte invece sono proprio come morti e puoi spostarli da una sedia ad un'altra senza che quasi reagiscano. Ciao...|`|c286027d8b0c082ec8fec016542b8e83aa	S dormono, dormono. Eccome|`|7bc852bb0c421dcf6cac5b7517f5d0e4aa	Dormono, eccome dormono!!!!!! Un gatto adulto dorme circa diciotto ore al giorno alternando fasi di sonno profondo a fasi di sonno paradosso, quello cio che interviene per primo.   Durante le diverse fasi del sonno, durante le quali sogna e talvolta.....russa fragorosamente, il cervello del gatto rimane per attivo. Raccoglie ed elabora continuamente dati sull'ambiente che lo circonda e si sveglia quando capta un'informazione per lui importante, come ad esempio, la tua presenza. Durante il sonno paradosso pu addirittura svegliarsi al semplice rumore di un pacchetto che viene aperto: Questo stato viene definito di semicoscienza.|`|c9e42b972ddb47408df55081b8941758aa	a volte dormono sul serio, per il resto sonecchiano|`|23b968f31483496f18ff5bc047c83e0aaa	I gatti dormono sempre, ma hanno un udito sviluppatissimo, quindi quando tu ti avvicini lui ti sente subito e si sveglia dandoti l'impressione k nn stesse dormendo!!!!!|`|5e97cf3474206969c1e6560f6b10ac3faa	si dormano|`|3de088fb5bc7386da3a56759225eace4aa	Normalmente il gatto schiaccia i suoi sedici sonnellini ogni giorno, ma quando fai anche il pi piccolo rumore e ti avvicini scattano come delle molle perch hanno i sensi molto sviluppati e temono di essere aggrediti.

Ma come fai a dire che il gatto  feroce, o  molto piccolo o  selvatico, feroce no.|`|7bc852bb0c421dcf6cac5b7517f5d0e4aa	I gatti hanno una loro personalit ben marcata che varia da soggetto a soggetto. E' comunque certo che saranno pi tranquilli se vivono in un contesto sereno, pi nervosi se inseriti in un ambiente caotico e litigioso  In quanto alla ferocia, non esistono gatti feroci, bens gatti psicologicamente disturbati, cio malati ed in questo caso l'unico  capace di risolvere il caso  un veterinario specializzato in neuropsicologia veterinaria.|`|8efb0878ee98b366d05d73b2e43518f0aa	Il gatto si affeziona moltissimo al padrone e quando il gatto e tenuto bene ed amato sa ripagare con tanto affetto.

L'ho presa da piccolissima quindi non  mai stata traumatizzata o maltrattata. Ne ho avuta un'altra, trovatella anche lei, che era in fin di vita, malata, denutrita ecc. L'ho salvata ed ha rivelato un carattere dolcissimo e coccolone. Oggi ho due maschi uno trovatello e l'altro a cui e' morta la mamma quando aveva 11 giorni, c'erano, nella cucciolata, lui ed altri 5 mici, 2 di questi non si fanno nemmeno toccare (pensa che li ho nutriti con il biberon ogni due ore per 40 giorni...) gli altri non si staccano mai da noi... vivrebbero in braccio... quindi....|`|150733c2d5677919a3ed03963fbc3b1aaa	rispecchia in parte. penso che il modo come vivi,quindi i rumori in casa,le urla,la mancanza di trnquillit possa influire il carattere del gatto.  quindi rispecchia il padrone  per domare il gatto feroce ,bhe!!  penso che :inizia a dargli dei calmanti,poi lascialo pi tranquillo possibile  ciao|`|330a011504e7337ad68edb48a802b9f8aa	pu essere... ma pu essere che ha anche paura delle persone, per un maltrattamento in passato... ci vuole molta pazienza per calmarlo, per farlo avere fiduccia in te... penso che pi difficile di un cane.|`|8de6fac04857d9d0fa8177705e3e75d3aa	assolutamente si!!!!!!!!!!!  la mia gatta  pigra e mangiona come mia sorella ed inoltre imita i suoi atteggiamenti: se mia sory va in bagno lei ci va pure, se va in cucina a mangiare lei vuole mangiare pure.... sa pure sbadigliare a comando!!!!!!

Possono essere un vero e proprio pericolo per i cani; si attaccano facilmente al pelo e sfruttandone il movimento riescono velocemente a forare la cute e a penetrare e, quasi sempre,  producono ascessi con presenza di pus. Devono essere rimosse con delle pinzette.  Il pericolo maggiore  che possano penetrare nell' orecchio del cane e la conseguenza peggiore  il perforamento del timpano.   Possono anche infilarsi nelle vie respiratorie e provocare starnuti e tosse anche con fuoriuscita di sangue.

The vet put in dissolving stitches so I wouldn't have to bring her back for stitch removal.  I had a large dog crate at the time and kept her in it with a litterbox and her food for 3 or 4 days. Then I let her out and she was as wild as ever even after seeing I was nice to her. She disappeared for a couple days because I guess I freaked her out.  But she's been living on my porch now for 4 years - I've yet to be able to pet her.    The vet may be able to give you some antibiotics you can mix with her food as well. It's not as accurate as putting the meds directly in her mouth but its better than nothing if she won't hold still for it. I treated my stray this way once when her foot got swollen from fighting with something.  She ended up being fine but she refused to be trapped a second time so I could take her into the vet!    You're doing the right thing getting her spayed and it sounds like you care for her and will provide for her.  I think she'll be fine! I have a heating pad in my kitty's outside box during the winter I leave on low and wrap her box in blankets and a tarp to keep the snow out.  She stays in the box when I put her food out and she comes and goes as she pleases - but she always comes back to sleep on my porch.    Good luck and thanks for taking care of the little girl!|`|9c3b098931fe282b48d51d36690c3a76aa	What wonderful correspondents you all are, and you all restore my faith in human nature - putting your pet's welfare before your own. I am a bit cat silly also ( owning a "Snowshoe" ) - Millicent. She was spayed and the op. never bothered her one bit - didn't need a cone, and within a week the wound had healed, and stitchess dissolved. Keep your stray cat warm and cosy, and well fed, and she'll be OK. She will take over your life, and why not, don't they all?|`|RJlsX1m7aa	Probably not.. she will most likely have stitches that will get infected as well as a cone on her head (which usually has to stay on for a few weeks, I believe), making it hard for her to function normally.  If you take her home right after her surgery (rather than have her spend the night at the vet's) she will also be on pain drugs and confused to her surroundings.    Do you have a friend or family member she can live with, or somewhere she can stay until you can find her a suitable home?  If you put up an ad on Craigslist or Kijiji with a little picture, I am sure you can find someone to give her a loving home!  Feel free to message me if you need any more help.. but don't get her fixed and then send her back out there!|`|DNRPrCO3aa	Some vets put a collar after fixing that cats wear about 5days, but some do not. I am not sure your cat can survive wearing it.  Ask a few vets' opinion.  |`|CtW18TGTaa	keep her in til shes healed get her on some flea meds too so she doesnt bring in "visitors" to infest your house even tho its winter cats  should  still be protected from fleas and heartworm. |`|tT5jyle5aa	this surgery is very traumatic for cats, and it requires a relaxing recovery. i don't think it will be safe for her to live outside while she is recovering.  other animals may attack her, or she might get an infection because she will be very weak.      if you can't afford to pay for a vet stay, and you don't know anyone who can keep her inside for a couple of days, maybe your vet would know of someone who could take care of her for a few days.  there are lots of people who foster animals for short periods of time.      another alternative would be for you to get medicine for your allergy, if you were willing to do that.    i think it is really wonderful that you are helping this cat!  you are being responsible and you have a big heart!  |`|pDKm9Wmgaa	She needs to be kept indoors until the sutures come out in 10 days. Otherwise she can pull them out on her own, or they can tear when she jumps in a tree or runs from a dog. |`|mdzuqUCaaa	If your willing to pay you can have her stay at the vet until shes fully healed but It will cost you.    Also claritin and benadryl work very well for allergy's and it will be less expensive then the vet stay.

znGpjsGjaa	It could be a Flemish Giant mix, it does not look like a pure breed.  it has very large ears, that is why I am saying Flemish. They do come in a color called Sandy which is the color of your rabbit. Since it is so young yet it is hard to tell as it has a lot of growing to do before it reaches maturity. A rabbit reaches maturity and it's adult weight when it is between 6-12 months old.    If you got it from a pet store it is most likely a mix.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	precious|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	i own 2 rabbits, one is a dwarf rabbit and the other is a lop of some kind. i haven't been able to indentify what kind of a lop it is, so i understand why you want to know what kind of bunny you have. it's very cute by the way. it would help to know if its full grown or not, or still just a baby. my best guess is that it is a golden palomino rabbit unless it is already full grown. palominos get to be approximately 9lbs when fully grown. they have brown eyes, a coarse, full coat that is a bright, golden shade with a cream or white undercoat. also their ears are a bit longer than some dwarf varieties. i hope this helps.it would be cool if i'm right about your little friend.|`|JQarjZBDaa	oh gawd thts a purdy bunny! cant tell though... take her to the feed store or somthing bet u they can tell ya!|`|BlpJnZOoaa	drawf and awwwwwwwwwwwww|`|xyF4PHzAaa	Awwww....adorible!  Looks like a Palomino rabbit.
bZhIEy1Waa	I'm sorry to have to tell you but its more than likely that your cat has sustained bad injuries in that collision! that's one hell of a speed to hit a soft bodied creature! Cat's will fight or flight - unless their bones are so badly broken that they can't move and so she has run off due to the shock and is probably hiding somewhere very dark and very quiet in the hope that she can nurse herself better. If she can't she just might  attempt to make her way home or she'll pass away where she is if her injuries are too severe, i'm sorry to have to say that. There are some cat's who will use up two or three of their nine lives and come through such an ordeal and i'll pray that your little girl is one of them! Put some posters up where she went missing asking everyone to check their sheds, outhouses, lock-ups and under bushes and under-growth - anywhere dark really. Also, ring around vets surgeries within a twenty mile radius of where she went missing - people may have been passing through and picked her up then delivered her to their vets? Ring your local police station too because the driver may have reported hitting the cat - its a slim chance but one worth taking. This may give you some hope - some years ago i was driving slowly ( due to the conditions of the road ) and a cat jumped out in front of my car ( i couldn't swerve as there were parked car's either side of me ) and so hit the poor soul head on. He bounced under the car and lay screaming in the road behind me - i gently picked him up and laid him on the back seat and drove like a loon to the nearest animal hospital. He was obviously badly hurt, he couldn't move and had gone downhill on the short drive to the hospital, i was distraught so much i couldn't drive home - my partner had to! I rang the hospital first thing the next morning and gave them my name and address and phone number and of course enquired about the cat i'd run over - he was stable but had sustained terrible injuries - boy did i feel terrible! I rang four times a day and put up posters of the accident near where i'd hit him but no-one answered them so i told the vet i'd adopt him if no-one came forward at the end of his surgery time. He had a fractured jaw, a fractured shoulder, had lost five of his claws from his front feet, lost two teeth and had serious kidney damage but he survived! Plus his owner came forward after three weeks, she'd been on holiday to the US! Its not all doom amd gloom even when we think it is - hold onto hope and you might have your prayers answered, i sincerely hope you do. Let us know how things go?|`|e4d2RWHTaa	Cat's keep going and going  Did you ever hear the 9 lives saying?  She'll have to be examined for you to know  unless she broke a leg , then she'd be limping.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	It is possible that the cat was injured, but how much I am not sure. Animals including humans when they have been injured, or have a very close call, I find have something called the fight and flight response, where they will take off and not be found. You should check in the surrounding area(s) as she might be injured and might need some help or assistance.|`|WS2Pq65Daa	I really think you should take her to the vet if you have any doubts! If you can find her feel around for broken bones(SHE COULD HAVE STARTED BLEEDING LATER AND NOT AT THE TIME OF THE IMPACT!)! Take her into you house and keep her WARM give her food and water! Keep her in your house for about a day and see if you notice anything wrong! This is the problem with strays they can easily get killed or hurt with all these roads and people around! I suggest you take all the strays you feed and bring them to a shelter or take them in! IT IS FOR THE BETTER!    Anyway I hope your little kitty is all right and GOOD LUCK!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	you need to locate the cat immediately. The cat could have just been in shock and that's how it was able to run. I've had cats all my life, and I've also had a couple of them get his by cars. One of them was really messed up but he was in shock so bad, that he didn't seem to notice that his back side was pretty much torn off. He had to be put to sleep, there was no saving him.
gQURk7dpaa	Don't worry, this is natural.    My sisters hamster did the same thing.  The thing is, you have got to let them settle into they're new cage for a while.  Provide them with food and clean water every day and wait 1 week before touching them.  They are still scared from the move away fromt heir other hamster buddies.  They have eachother and they will figure it out together.  I would suggest expanding the cage a bit for more room to explore.  They will LOVE that.  Keep them occupied but now with your hands, not even reach in to pet them.     After 1 week is the hard part.  Get some gloves.  Yup.  That's the hardest part.  I don't prefer glove handling unless it's the first time holding them.  I prefer gardening gloves because hamsters can bite HARD.  Now just pick them up.  One day spend time with one and the other spend time with the next day.  Observe them on your gloves and watch if they bite.  If they do, I hate to say this but it's for your safty, keep them on.  Keep observing and after they stop biting and get used to the feel keep one glove off.  You can hold them with either hand and use another to pet.  Once you are sure they are not biting take the other off.  Try not to feed them by hand until they get better because they will relate your hand to their food and bite it.    If your hamsters do, unfortunatly, bite you again, DO NOT BE AGGRESIVE.  Keep your cool because in my theory of hamsters (sorry if that wasn't funny =p)  they can sense emotions like dogs.  Put the hamster in her cage calmly and then go to the nearest sink.  It will sting a lot so keep your hand under the coolest water for 2 minutes.  When your done dissinfect it with bactine or neosporn to make sure it doesn't get infected.  Last just put on a band-aid    Well, I hope I helped and the last step, make sure it has barbies or spongebobs on it ;-).

Shots are the same for all dogs unless they need something for a specific type of treatment. Her grooming is about 30 and they take long to grow there hair back. toys about 15 every like 6 months to a year. Food well they eat very little so what ever brand you perfer.|`|lMYuPrhIaa	Yorkies are pretty loud. They also VERY hard to potty train, because they are so small.    The dog will probably be ok with the birds.    Everything tht is required for a dog, is EXTREMELY expensive. I'd say yearly, vet cost, food, grooming, and everything else it would cost AT LEAST $1000 dollars. That's not including emergencies or anything.|`|PkhDAXxpaa	I have a Yorkie, he is my favorite baby! They are full of personality and all dogs bark. Just remember they are fragile. They are prone to hip disorders, mine had surgery at 8 mths old and it cost $800. They are also prone to gum disease, you MUST have regular dental cleanings, very expensive.|`|1Z0HPPKvaa	Well you could always go to google and type in Yorkie or ask the pet store owner if you get it from the pet store or human society or where ever you purchase your yorkie they are hard to potty train and take allot of patience and need to be washed regularly  because of their long hair especially if its outside alot i had a yorkie and it liked alot of attention so i hope this helps its the best i could do well congrats on your new yorkie|`|mOUKeMw2aa	I also have a yorkie.  I've had her for three years and shes been a great friend.  Can't say I've experienced any of the problems you mentioned though I do believe they hold true for any dog.      Enjoy your new friend which ever you choose.    by the way, its easier to clean a tiny poop in the event of an accident.
AA11392159	Try dabbing some vanilla extract on the back of both their necks... and maybe even put a little on yourself when you are around him for a day or two. Part of the reason they MAY be fighting is the fact that they smell too different from each other.     I was afraid I'd have to give my kitten away after we got her, because our male cat was really mean to her and they weren't getting along at all. I talked to a vet-friend of mine and she suggested the vanilla thing... It worked wonderfully...|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Sounds like the male cat does not like the other cat and if he is crawing you, running after you then that means he is playing with you!|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	do u think that male cat is gay? sorry to say it but just wondering! if not, try to give him some time! he will find out his destiny soon!|`|WLOYtPA1aa	Well, that mean he want her out of his life   so he can win.

You should try to check in with your vet to ask her/him.|`|krqfJViEaa	It depends on which type of hamster.    Syrian hamsters can live to 3-4 years    Dwarf hamsters can live around 1-2 years    (These are the categories of hamsters. Golden, Panda, Blackbear etc. hamsters fall into the category of Syrian hamsters and Russian Dwarf, Robovorski, etc fall into the category of dwarf.)  But of course all hamsters are diff. and a dwarf hamster can live up to 4 years or a syrian can live sometimes only 2 years. etc.   Their all different, but it does depend on how good your hamster is treated and if they catch a disease or not.

NnYB9eXiaa	Yes, female hamsters will eat their young for several reasons: immaturity, sick or injured pup, or they feel threatened.  It's the mother pup that does this, not the father.      PLEASE read the following info before you think about breeding.    Go to the library, get some books out on hamsters.  Talk to a local breeder, see if they'll mentor you.      The following list may look like all negative things, and the first section IS a list of reasons not to breed unless you are completely prepared, the second section contains information you need to know if you still decide to breed.    Please keep all the following things in mind BEFORE you breed:    Don't breed if your hamsters are from a pet store.    Why?    Poor breeding causes things like shortened lifespans, susceptibility to illness, and poor temperement (i.e. aggressive hamsters).    Well bred hamsters are not aggressive; this does not mean they won't ever bite, but it does mean they won't go out of their way to bite and will be generally more receptive to handling and be quite a bit friendlier.    Second, if they are from a pet store you don't know their genetic background.    You may be passing along undesirable traits such as aggressiveness and tendencies towards cancers, illness, and physical deformities.    Third, hamsters can have 14+ babies per litter.    Selling them to a pet store guarantees their death; they will be sold as feeders for reptiles and snakes.    Unless you can line up 14+ homes ahead of time, DO NOT BREED.    Fourth: Hamsters are already seriously overpopulated in pet stores; many go for feeders, many more die before they leave the store.    Unless you have an exceptionally rare mutation, and know its (and its prospective mate's) genetic background and pedigree, you should not breed them.    There is no good reason to breed already poorly, and over bred hamsters.    Please do not breed your hamsters for their sake and the sake of any offspring.    If you want more hamsters, adopt one from a shelter, buy one from a breeder, or as a dead last resort, buy one from a pet store. [Edit from Daisy - try petfinder, freecycle and craigslist as well]    Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal, not just because they were able to buy a male and female.    http://www.pet-care-experts.com/archive....    ----------------------------------    Important information before making a big decision:    1. You'll need quite a few cages, bins are preferable as breeding cages but there is money involved in setting up a hamstery.    2. You generally need a room just for the hamstery, you aren't going to want a lot of disturbance with the pups or pregnant mothers - especially if you have other animals or small children in the house.    3. You'll be spending a lot of time with your hamsters, you need to make sure that you have time with school and other activities to balance this out.    4. You need to be prepared for visits to the vet.  These aren't always inexpensive visits.    5. You'll need lots of research on genetics and health history.  Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal.  You should never breed a hamster bought from a pet store, so you'll need to find a local breeder - perhaps they'll mentor you - again, this will take a lot of your free time.    6.  You need to make sure you have homes lined up *before* you begin breeding.  It's safe to assume a minimum of 2-4 pups and it can be upwards of 14 in a litter.      7.  You really shouldn't try to sell the pups until you've bred multiple times and built up a reputation.  This means you won't be earning money from the pups, so there will be money involved that you won't be able to recoup for awhile.    As far as the actual breeding, and logistics and all of the technical aspects of things, there are many good breeders on this site that can help you.  I'm sure one of them will chime in on that portion of things :)    Just remember, study, research, think, then breed! Try to possibly find an breeder online that will mentor you. Home breeding, when done responsibly is perfectly fine - just be sure you're ready and you start with 2 healthy animals whom you know the genetics and health history of :)|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Hamster mothers will only eat their babies if you held one of the babies, but she will not eat all of the babies.    If your hamster trusts you like 100% then she will allow you to hold the babies. If she does not trust you all the way then do not hold her babies until the babies are about 2 weeks old.    It is a scary process but you MAY NOT TOUCH HER BABIES! Yes they are so cute and all (my hamster just had 11 babies) you wanna do is hold them but you can't.    Good Luck!  Have Fun!  Take This Advice!|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Sometimes if they're sick or you touch the babies some hamsters will. Mine had babies and she didn't eat them. But other people have told me that they do.|`|vjww5cN7aa	Thats happened to me.     The mother almost ate like 12 out of 17 babies... (yes, she had 17 babies at once)    I think they will do it to, erm... "protect" their babies.    I don't think the mother is trying to hurt them.       When I saw the mother doing it, i separated the babies from the mother. I fed the rest of them with kitten formula through a syringe. I suggest doing this, even know it may take a lot of attention. I kept the babies in an empty plastic fish cage..|`|EdN7fkTgaa	The mother will not eat her babies if you don't touch them or disturb her. Well for the father you have to separate him to another cage or he will eat the baby hamsters. If you have a dwarf hamsters you need not separate them as the father will help to take care of the babies. i had experienced taking care of baby hamsters and its Pretty easy.Here is a website you can go to for information on how to take care of baby hamsters:http://www.myhammie.com/baby-hamsters.ph...|`|WFzt2fHOaa	the mom hamster will eat her babies if she is deprived of protein or if she cannot provide enough milk for all the babies.  Its also a bad idea to touch the babies, you will get your scent on them, and she might feel threatened.  please do not breed your hamster if you do not know the genetic background of both parents, and have homes lined up for up to 20 hamsters.  good luck!!|`|x1KRxDuGaa	First of all, I don't recommend breeding hamsters, because all the hamsters at petstores come from mills anyway. They are over bred, and it's just horrible. So please don't breed them. It is hard work, and you have to have the money to pay for a vet if something goes badly. And yes, if you touch the babies, the mother could eat them because they have a different scent on them. Sorry|`|EHqhirz8aa	Yes. If the hamster baby is not separated from it's mother soon after is ready to be on it's own, get the baby hamster immediately out. As in the wild, if there is not "enough" food to feed all the others, the mother will eat a few. So, because of their little tradition, hamsters still do this. I hoped this helped you! But, I wouldn't breed hammies. Look at the world right know. We are in an animals are homeless crisis! Well, it is your choice. :)|`|YWiLfZGsaa	Yes they do- it depends on if they sense something wrong or are afraid or upset at any time. It can be pretty awful.|`|jiXQ8eDFaa	There are a lot of situations that can cause a hamster to eat her young, including/not limited to stress, malnutrition, babies being handled too much, etc. I had it happen as a child when my mother bought me a male and female hamster to witness "the miracle of life." The mother ate her baby's head off. It was miraculous, let me tell you.|`|HF0oDEd0aa	Very important information!    DON'T TOUCH the Babys if you touch them while their still new born and not matured yet if you touch them it may cause HARM to the Babys and may mix thier sent so the mother might not realize them and may abandon them or worse yet EAT THEM! but keep them away from the daddy unless it is a dwarf hamster then your ok with the daddy eating him and put LOADS OF FOOD in the cage cause they might eat the babys if they have MALNUTRITION  and  AVOID CLEANING the cage within this time period|`|krqfJViEaa	Well to make sure that your hammies dont get eaten, do NOT stick your hand in the cage except to replace their food and water. (If you do, they will think that the babies are danger and eat them)   But even if you do this and the mother DOES eat her babies then the babies were most likely ill or sick and had no chance of survival.   But if they were healthy and their was no human contact, the babies will not be eaten by their mothers.    Hope I helped! :)

Science Diet, Eukanuba, Blue Buffalo, Natures Variety, ETC....|`|ThZOfp81aa	I would say Goodlife Recipe.  It has fewer byproducts and such.  If you want to go one-up, I'd suggest Royal Canin.  They have specialty foods for everything, and it's very high quality.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Purina of any kind is really not the best foods.  Wellness, Natural Balance, Innova, Royal Canin are all much better foods.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Neither one is my vote.  And why?  Look at the first couple of ingredients for both of them.    Healthful Life:  Chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, soybean meal, ground wheat, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), salmon meal, salmon, chicken    The Goodlife:  GROUND CORN, CHICKEN BY-PRODUCT MEAL, CORN GLUTEN MEAL, ANIMAL FAT, CHICKEN    Neither one of them contain much in the way of actual meat.  Nature made cats to be obligate carnivores - they were meant to eat meat, not corn.  Corn's a cheap filler with little to no nutritional value for cats.  By-products are another cheap filler.  They aren't meat - they're the scrap "parts" deemed unfit for human consumption - beaks, hides, tendons, spinal chords, diseased and spoiled meat, and even the scrapings off the slaughterhouse floor.  All waste products.  Is this what you wanted to feed to your cat?      I must admit they do a great job of advertising - their packages show pieces of healthy meat, and nice healthy vegetables (which cats really don't need).  Do you want to pay for clever packaging, or a healthy food for your cat?  Buy a food (not at the grocery store) where a real meat is the first ingredient, and has few if any grains or by products.  An analogy is this - boxed macaroni and cheese are cheap, and food for us humans, but it is healthy?  Neither is the filler-laden foods that are so cheap at the grocery store.
nmercOm7aa	All dog (and cat) foods have to be tested on the animal to get AAFCO approval. Some companies do better tests than other.   IAMS does not do good tests.   I believe that Orijen does good testing. You can contact the company for more info.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You can look at this site for additional info but they were filmed before doing testing. Supposedly recently they don't anymore but who knows....    http://www.uncaged.co.uk/iams.htm|`|FWlSFpByaa	Yes they do. Same with Purina and Science diet|`|26PPwzrWaa	yes. Every dog food company has to include animals in feeding test over a 6 month period, but iams and eukanuba takes it a step further by mimicing gingivitis and other crap.   www.pandgkills.com   www.iamscruelty.com     I am not a fan of peta, but these sites tell the truth about the company you are asking about.|`|AA10356572	Iams and Eukanuba are owned by Proctor and Gamble.. one of the companies most notoriously known for cruel animal testing - they also own Febreeze and Swiffer.. and several hundreds of "test animals"|`|giQXgwRCaa	I hear they do--That's why I would NEVER buy an Iams products. They are so cruel.|`|AA10682144	They surely do. So does Purina and Hills brands...|`|ajJViUbcaa	I think all pet foods have to be tested on animals. How else would they be able to know if animals would benefit from eating it?|`|FhVobWpeaa	Yes those cruel money makers do test on animals.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	How  would you do animal testing on a dog !  Do they inject their food into its skin! NO!  Its a taste test stupid!!!!!!|`|yjJFE2dEaa	Yep. Not only do they do animal testing, but they are also responsible for shocking cruelty.

It's horrible!  They force-feed it to sick animals and then cut them open WITH NO PAINKILLERS OR WHILE THEYRE ASLEEP|`|dAJJGWKnaa	idk but they ARE animal products and dogs are animals. i think they kind of have to test them on animals to see if they work or how animals react to them.
Px79AEXtaa	make a game of it inside the house first.  get three or four family members and let each of them have a tiny bag of treats... special treats like little pieces of meat or cheese.  have everyone sit in a different room.  one by one call the dogs name and when she comes, praise her and give her a piece of meat.  every time she comes when called give her a treat, but once in a while just scratch her tummy or pat her and tell her she's a good girl  that way you aren't just food rewarding.  you will be amazed at how fast she learns.  after she masters it inside, try it outside.  you can also buy a clicker at petco... every time you give your dog a treat you can click and the dog will associate the clicker to come when called too.  most dogs learn well by rewarding them.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Repetition and reward.|`|ZIVbFnOuaa	keep practicing and give them a small treat when the come|`|hBAG3u3paa	Just train them some more. Police dogs are trained really good you know! They will eventually start listening to you.|`|OfPSBAu5aa	you have to first train the dog by giving him a reward each time he/she responds to his/her name. Then after a while, train him/her without the treat and pretty soon the dog will understand when you call 'em.|`|oruWntCfaa	well if ur dog dont no its name say its name allot like when u talk to it and like say its name then come and have a treat in ur hand and reward when itcomes and soon u wont need treats|`|tjJGkdppaa	well, if you just got him and he/shes still a puppy, go buy a little tub of little treats and everytime you say the dogs name and he even looks at you, guve him some treat! if hes an older dog (or just not brandy new), be more strick and dont yell, but talk loudly at him/her and when she does come, treats :)|`|geJM58L2aa	You just have to use his/her name often.  I got my puppy about 5 months ago and she's been doing very well with listening when I or my husband call her name.  When we first got her we just watched her for a little while to come up with a name that went with her.  We ended up with Lexi and since then we use her name often. We say "stop Lexi" or "let's go outside Lexi" or we pick her up and say "hi Lexi" or just little things like that so she hears it often and become familiar with it.      Now if we just say "Lexi" she comes over so we don't really need to ask her to come.  In order to get her to listen when we just say "come" we have to say it in a real happy tone so she gets excited and comes over.|`|sWkcLzJtaa	say,"(dogs name), come!" in a high intresting voice. if the dog doesnt come try lying down or saying wii wii! in a super fast, high voice. when the dog comes, give it a treat.|`|VGHY0pUtaa	Keep calling it by that name, give it a treat once in a while if he looks at you while calling him/her.

If your dog is a puppy, then it should be easy just keep calling it.  Like, say it's name when your around it, and when you want it say it's name and it will eventually catch on that, those words your saying is what you call it and when you say those words it means that you want him/her to come.  But if your dog is older and STILL doesn't understand that, then it's going to be hard to teach him/her.  Because dogs learn easier when they are puppies.  It's still manageable though.           Good luck! :)|`|bYU77eteaa	put fishing line around his collar and when you call him..."reel" him in...he has a hard time seeing it so eventually he will be like...sh*t...I better take my a$$ over there cuz I dont know if I'm tied up or what.    Do this for like 5 or 10 minutes a day until he gets it down...it dont take much except consistancy    dont let him get away with anything...even if you accidently tell him to come to you, go through with it because if he can get away with it once...he will try to get away with it again and again    Treats are always nice, but I didn't train my dog with treats...I trained him with praise and dicipline
1jV4xzLaaa	one way to get him to stop would be to thoroughly clean out the crate with special dog mess cleaner (that kills all of the urine enzymes) because if you dont get the smell all the way out, he will keep smelling his own scent and thinks it is a bathroom.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	There could be a few reasons for this. Is her crate too big? It need to be big enough to only turn around and stand up in. Also clean it very good to get the urine scent out. Do you schold her for going in her crate or the house? If so she may be going in there to hide from you to pee. If she is afraid to go in front of you she will hide. This comes from scolding. I learned the hard way with this. And laslty sometimes you will get a dog that will go anywhere. I had a dog before that didnt mind going pee or poop in her crate. Hope one of these solutions will help you.|`|k6yACyHraa	Her cage might be to big and it helps if it is smaller because she will not want to do her business if that is the only place she can go.  But you need to disinfect every thing.  It can also mean that she needs to outside but you are not paying any attention to her, but she knows not to go in the house. If you can just leave a door open to let her go out.  When they are puppies they wake up in the night because they are afraid. to fix this put her cage in your bed room which will make her not wake up in the middle of the night.  When dogs wake up and move around i makes them have to go potty.  Or it may be that someone in your neighborhood that has their alarm clock go off which wakes up your dog you can tell this because it will be the same time everyday.|`|JsBb732Maa	http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Informa...|`|EeJMITyCaa	Your crate may not be small enough. Try finding a smaller crate. Also, wash that crate in vinegear and the the stuff they sell in pet stores to get rid of pet urine and poo scent and then start feeding her in the crate or any crate if the current crate is too big. Dogs usually won't be where they sleep or eat. However, if your crate is too big then your puppy will probably try to pee on one end and sleep on the other. Thats why you need a small crate. Just one big enough for her to turn around.
uBFhKXgHaa	I can't give you a picture because there's no such thing as a teacup Yorkie.    They are not recognized as an actual breed size, the smallest breed size recognized is toy. All 'teacup' dogs are are the runts of toy dogs bred together by backyard breeders to create tiny, sickly dogs with a cutesey name tacked on. They are scams, and only backyard breeders breed them.     Read:  http://www.barkrescue.net/teacup.htm (The Teacup Puppy Phenomenon - The Sad Truth About "Teacup Dogs")  http://www.thebombpoms.com/Teacups.html (The Truth About Teacups)      Darksong~|`|Za8DpfvQaa	I own a teacup hypoallergenic RottBullSheagleCockaPoodleDoo.    This is a very rare breed. And, they are hypoallergenic! I plan to be breeding a litter soon. They will be ACY registered.    Interested? If so, please say so. I am estimating they will be sold for about $3500 for pet proce. No breeding rights available. Leave breeding to the professionals (me)    JOKING!    Here are some pictures:  http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&re...|`|PeUk4TuPaa	well...here are yorkies.......  http://photobucket.com/images/yorkie/|`|q0vKbocHaa	go to http://www.dogbreedinfo.com and type in Teacup Yorkie or simply yorkie. they look exactly the same, except a teacup is smaller|`|26PPwzrWaa	Well, I was about to tell you about the teacup scam but I was beaten to the punch.     Sadly most people insist they have a teacup. I guess teacup does sound better than runt of the litter, especially when they probably paid more than the average price of a well bred yorkie.     http://www.ytca.org/mainview.htm|`|nooi0ldjaa	no such things as a tea cup dog, of any breed.    you could always look up "yorkie pics" on google!|`|L22hVXTIaa	You won't get a response from any "tea cup" Yorkie owners because there is no such thing as a "tea cup" any breed.  "Toy" dogs - the AKC does recognize the "toy" designation have weight and size ranges as specified by the AKC.  All dogs of a certain breed fall somewhere WITHIN the weight range, whether it be at the high end or low end, without exceeding the maximum weight allowed.  Now, with that said, I don't have a picture for you, but "yes" Yorkies are absolutely adorable puppies and gorgeous as adults.  Best of luck to you.
e9bv4ijlaa	these are question you should of asked the vet, not people on the internet|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Asking your vet is better.  We don't know your dog - size breed or age. I would say you are correct about 3,4 days to recover with NO activity at all.  I wouldn't take her on any walks until cleared by vet but guessing after he removes the stitches it will be fine.  She shouldn't be exposed to anything while healing anyway.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Keep her as quiet as you can until the stitches come out.  This is major surgery.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Your vet knows better. What I know is that, Spaying/Neutering has many benefits other than preventing unwanted puppies. You may want to read this, http://dogtime.com/spay-neuter.html to know more about it.
MGAmNxddaa	There really ARE some unknowledgable people here,isn't there? Well,if this was just yesterday,no her breasts would not swell up in one day.And ,it may take 4-5 weeks by looking at her to tell she is pregnant.A vet can do a test in about a week(costs around $75. here)  to tell you if she is pregnant.PS,please tell these uninformed people that when a dog is in heat,THAT is WHEN female dogs get pregnant!!LOL Thanks!|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Man I hate ignorant people. Duh, when a dog is in heat, that is when she will become pregnant!|`|RFfTjnxzaa	There's a very VERY high possibility she's pregnant. Your brother was completely irresponsible. A female in heat must be segregated from any males, period.    Take her to the vet and have an ultrasound performed.    If you choose to let her have the pups, either find homes for them or keep them yourself. Don't abandon them or put them in a shelter. Such actions are irresponsible and give every owner of an intact dog a bad name.|`|sWkcLzJtaa	They are swollen becuase she is in heat. Thought she could pregnant too. Ask a vet. If it was only yesterday, he/she probly cant tell yet, but its worth giving it a try.|`|EXkCsNtRaa	Well it's really possible to be not pregnant  but she could be too. If shes in heat and other male dogs hump her that means shes not pregnant! Sorry if this don't help you but that's all the info that I know!|`|0fuF2sHbaa	Oh yeah, they turn green and start shooting lasers out of their eyes.    You know nothing about dogs, or breeding. Phone the vet, arrange for her to be checked over and spayed.    Too many unsound dogs are irresponsibly bred, and for the same reason so many live a decade of their life locked in a cold cage in a rescue center.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	WHY would you do that? Spay your dog for goodness sakes!|`|eMZthQnKaa	well when a dog is in heat, it is like being on their period. So you might have to wait a couple of weeks and see if she is peeing a lot. If she is then she could be pregnant. If  you still are not sure, just take her to the vet and get her checked out! Hope this helps!!!
ADLupVviaa	It sounds like your lab is stressed and wanting to know why the pup in invading her home. The best way to introduce them is have them both on a lead and walk them around the yard together and reward the lab for behaving herself. (this could take several attempts)   Once they dont react badly to being near each other then let the pup off the lead but keep the lab on the lead incase the lab reacts badly to the pup being allowed to come close and keep rewarding the lab with food for good behavior.    Keep in mind that your lab will have her nose put out with the pup around so make sure she knows she is still loved.    I would recomend you research "Positive re-enforcement" training methods to help with the transtition as it can take several weeks for two dogs to relax with each other.|`|CNer40Xhaa	You made a very irresponible descision. You should have intoduced them on mutual territory. Well. Go to the dog park and let them get to know each other gradually. You might have to give one up if fights break out. Be smart. You might also want to do doga or doggie massage|`|DYxb7P3Baa	introduce them slowly. keep them on a leash and let them go slowly closer. when they seem like they want to go away, then pull them apart . keep doing this until they finally get the hang of it. if she chases him, its probably she wants to play. and drooling doesnt mean shes hungry, big dogs just tend to drool. make sure there is someone watching them if they don't get along well.    good luck xP|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Calm down the jack    not the lab!|`|VHFf1dOMaa	I would suggest a nice Tea or Coffee setting,  Perhaps invite some doggie bones into the mix and before you know it things will be great.    ** I think your dog is probably just nervous, we just got and 8 wk old basset hound along with our year old basset hound and she keeps trying to sit on the puppy.  So I think it'll be just fine :D Give it time and remember to give both of them lots of attention.***|`|fd4a3ae51fa692f02b61eba26cc79c77aa	Buy a dog crate for the pup. This will help introduce the dogs (over time your lab is able to smell and meet the pup but cannot hurt the pup) and is excellent for potty training. The drooling is likely a sign of excitement. I would not put the two together yet, because it sounds like your lab could hurt the pup. Allow your dog to adjust to the pup with the pup safely in a wire dog crate. A crate will allow your pup to have a safe and secure place she can call her own. Feed her in her crate. Take her from it to potty at regular intervals, supervised time out  with you, another potty break then back in the crate. Put your lab in another room when the pup is out for now. As she gets older use the crate only for bed time, to feed her separately, and when you are not at home. Say  "house!" and give her a treat when she goes into the crate and verbal reward.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	My black lab is 8 years old. Labs are hyper and she drools while playing, eating, watching other people eat, etc. LOL.  Labs are very playful and hyper so this is normal. She is just excited. My lab was like that with my cat. They were best friends and they played alot together. Give her time and once she is used to him she will calm down.
w1lh1INHaa	Urinary tract or bladder infection.  Vet, first thing tomorrow.  No, do not wait until Monday.|`|AA10093245	If you're feeding him only dry food, you need to switch it up for canned wet food for a while, he probably has a urinary tract infection. Cats who eat only dry food get this a lot of times, and they are peeing, but it's only a drop or so and it's hard to go. He isn't getting enough liquids and it can become serious.|`|zRmwEFAwaa	He's trying not to be rude by releasing methane gas from his bottom into the litter box.    Obviously NOT pregnant if he's a guy cat ^_^|`|AA10431326	I had a cat do this one time and he had an infection.  Get your cat to the vet.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	If he's straining to use the litter box do not hesitate! Take him to a vet or emergency clinic immediately!  Cats are well-known for getting urinary blockages.  All cats are susceptible, but neutered males are at an even higher risk than other cats.    If you are lucky, it may be that he just has a UTI (which will need antibiotics), but if he is blocked he may need over night care.    Don't wait! Go now!|`|2rdXW293aa	Sounds like a urinary tract infection. Please take your cat to the vet first thing tomorrow. UTIs are *very* uncomfortable for a cat, and require antibiotics. The sooner he's started on those, the better. My cat had a UTI one time, and we had to try 3 different medications before we found one that worked.     You may also want to keep him in the bathroom overnight tonight (with litter box, food and water) in case he starts to pee in other places, so you don't wind up with urine in the carpet, which is a royal pain to get out.    Good luck to you and your kitty!|`|HcLnRvg6aa	maybe its pregnant|`|wlm2BPqwaa	maybe it has diaria
CeF2dg9Kaa	I would do tons of research on Ferret.  I mean learn EVERYTHING you possibly can about them from what they eat (birth to senior) to proper waste management!  After all the research and you decide that you still want a ferret, go to your parents and present them with that you learn.    Also, take responsibilities for your dogs.  Show your parents you are responsible by taking your dogs for walks, bathing and brushing them, feeding them, and cleaning up after them.      We must lead by example.  Good luck.|`|CVXCSTHoaa	They are a lot of responsibility especially two ferrets. ferrets can destroy a house in one day make sure you ferret proof your house if not they will get into bed and couches where you have to get them out, we already had to cut my couch to get my one ferret. And i see you said they need to be out for 2-4 hours a day, actually they should be out of their cage for 4+ hours a day or they will get depressed. I know you said to avoid those but i just wanted to make sure you know.    Now To get your parents to give in is very hard. As mention in some of the above post take care of the dogs make sure your the one feeding, watering, taking out, and cleaning up after them. Also help your mom/dad around the house more clean when your not asked to do dishes and stuff like that to show that you can handle the responsibility.I don't know if it snowing where you are at but if you have a driveway or something go out and shovel it. Also put together some Research and sit down with your parents and give them a presentation on everything you know about ferrets.     Make sure you show you can handle a responsablity to those animals and that may take a month or so of doing things like that, but if you keep up with that stuff it shows you have interest in something.    It took me all most 3 years to finally to get mine and they are very hard work, they are like a young child and they will terroize the house.    Good luck with your parents and hope you can convince them.|`|RWeYKj0qaa	Do you own a pet now?  Have you ever owned a pet?  Why would they think your not responsible enough if you have never owned a pet?  Unless you have and that is what they are basing their opinion on. Ferrets can be smelly if not properly cared for.  They are social and need lots of attention.  Females must be spayed as once they go in heat they will not go out until they are bred.  Males also have to go in heat.  They make great pets.  But like any animal they are dependent on you for their very existence. Be sure of what you want.
ICzM3T8taa	Oatmeal is very bad for birds because oatmeal absorbs water and it can swell up in there bellies and the birds could and most likely will die from it.    Sorry.  Stick with what you have been feeding them.    Good Luck.|`|RVYVg7Craa	What's The Question?|`|2LJV50vhaa	You just buy the special mix for cockatiles.My birds would sometimes eat a grape or piece of apple,but in general it is far better for them to use the balanced proprietary mix supplied in the pet food stores.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Dry oatmeal is not part of a cockatiel's diet. I don't think I'd be supplying it to the babies just yet. Mum and dad will probably just ignore it, anyway.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Please consult your avian vet concerning the diet of your birds, what is toxic to them, what isn't healthy & not needed.....the vet will give you educational materials and teach you what & what not to feed your birds.
po62AbPqaa	you cannot help your rat without a vet...sorry     but your ratty has a bad infection, and even possibly more than one type of infection    she will definitely need antibiotics and the vet will need to prescribe which ones and the dosage     sorry, but having a pet means that it is necessary to make a visit to the vet on occassion....and believe me this is one such occassion    if you choose not to take her to a vet then no doubt serious and irreparable damage can be done to her lungs and ears    good luck with it :>|`|44kEtDvIaa	You can try site below and match symptoms.  Also has some other rat sites with good medical info.  As well, there's an "animal hospital" link and you can send email symptoms.. but be specific and don't abuse their system.  No matter what you do, it looks like the vet has to be an option.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	This is not good-your rat most likely has an inner ear infection.  I had a male rat that started head-tilting 2 days after I adopted him,took him to the vet and she put him on   antibiotics:Baytril/Doxycyline combo 2x a day for approx 10 days.  The problem with inner ear infections is this:it could either somewhat go away no its own (though not completely),it could spread into the sinuses and cause major respiratory problems,which could lead to pneumonia and eventually death.Sorry to say,but I have been through this more times like I like to admit,but I believe that a trip to the vet is your only option.Good luck with your precious little girl!|`|KeevlZnTaa	There is no way to help her without taking her to the vet. The symptoms sound like an ear infection, as well as a respiratory infection. Rats do not get colds, therefore your rat does not have a cold. The fact that she is only 3 months makes it more likely a ear infection, than a tumor or a stroke(which also have head tilt/"circling" symptoms.    The head tilt, and "circling", is the symptom of an ear infection. The sneezing and runny nose is a respiratory infection. There is no way to treat an infection without a course of antibiotics. Unfortunately without treatment the infection will get worse and eventually kill her. As the respiratory infection progresses, she will have more trouble breathing, and you'll begin to hear crackling when she breaths. Infections eventually cause sepsis, and get into the blood.|`|GuOJIftAaa	You HAVE to take her to the vet. I am sorry, that's just how it goes. It sounds like she has a very bad ear infection or has had a stroke. Unless you want her to die, the vet is the only option. I just wish people would understand that when they get pets, they are obligated to take them to the vet when they're sick. If you had a child and it got sick, would you just wait around till it was convinent for you?! No! If you cant afford the vet, you DONT deserve the pet.|`|AA11565057	If you can't take her to a vet and get antibiotics, you should prepare for her to die. Sorry, but you can't treat an infection easily at home! If veterinary care for your pet isn't an option, you shouldn't HAVE a pet. Give her to an animal shelter. If they don't put her down, they will at least shell out the money to get her veterinary care (unlike you!). You can afford to access a computer and internet, so clearly you have particular priorities in life that don't include appropriate care for your pets.    Aside from giving her to a shelter, waiting for her to die, or taking her to a vet, you need to make her as comfortable as possible.    You should make sure that she's getting adequate food. If her appetite isn't good or if she's losing weight, give her ANYTHING that she will eat.    You could consider separating them but if it's a virus, your other rat would have already caught it.|`|4SQx8smEaa	That is not good, how old is your rat?? My rat had the same exact symptoms, he just passed away last night. He lost a lot of weight, and could barely walk, almost like his back legs were paralyzed, and it looked like he had a string of puss in his eye, but it was actually his eye that had turned that color. Please please you have to take your rat to the vet. It is very serious!! Their is a good chance that she may die. It is nothing that you yourself will be able to help her with. All that you can do is make her feel as comfortable as possible. Hope your rat gets better, Good Luck.    I myself also thought that he had a cold, he did get better for awhile, but then it came back about a month later.
Z3OTphZhaa	I prefer dry because it has more nutrients in them than canned food, but when my dogs are puppies, I add a little can to the dry to help them chew better.  I guess it is a matter of opinion, but based on my talks with the vets, the dry food is a better choice.    Unfortunately, I don't have time to prepare home foods.  As a full time worker, a mother, and a son involved in various sports, the last thing I have is time to prepare dog food when I barely have enough to prepare dinner for my growing kid.  Yes, it is obviously more healthy to prepare home foods, but for some, it isn't an option so I use the next best option.|`|xrgzvm6Daa	i mix wet and dry food together, but i dont do it everyday because the wet food gets them really really fat really fast|`|ckuiowpKaa	dried because it cleans their teeth.|`|q93ARca5aa	Dry food typically has more nutrients than wet. I would mix it. Give them both. Dry food will help with cleaner teeth too.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Dry dog food is always better for dogs than canned food.  since maltese typically have bad teeth only feeding canned will not help compared to dry.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Contrary to popular belief dry food does not clean teeth, nor is dry food more nutritious.  Good quality wet foods contain more meat and less carbs. They do not cause obesity, they do not cause tooth problems. Wet food is a more natural food for dogs (dry food is not natural at all).    In order of best diet for dogs: Raw, wet good quality dry.    Some very good qualiy canned foods....Wellness, Wellness Ninety-Five Chicken or Turkey, Canidae, Chicken Soup, Merrick just to name a few.|`|lMYuPrhIaa	dogs or dry food?    EDIT: Dry food is best. Wet food is bad for their teeth and dry food is better for their teeth.    Put cooked carrots and brocolii in there on occasion to change it up. Or add some gravy, rice, or boneless, skinless chicken.|`|5M5BFB5Caa	Dry food is better for a multitude of reasons.  Not only is it healthier (if you read on a dog can it says to feed much less than what most people feed the dog) but it's cheaper.  Also, dry food is less likely to cause early tooth decay and severe dental problems.  With puppies, if they're having trouble eating the dry food, moisten it with a little water (not enough to pull all the nutrients out) just enough to allow the food to soften a little bit until you think the puppy can handle it on it's own.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Either. Whichever your mom chooses, a good teeth brushing will be needed every couple days.     If you dont want to brush the dogs teeth, you can feed a couple raw meaty bones i.e chicken drumsticks, thighs, wings. instead.   www.rawmeatybones.com  www.rawlearning.com  www.rawfed.com/myths    Add: When you eat dry crunchy cooked beyond recognition potato chips, you get a paste on your teeth. When you eat gumbo, you dont get that paste. So how is that different for a dog/cat?    Vet nutritional advice is biased. Just look at the crap they sell in their offices. www.dogfoodproject.com Look at the ingredients to avoid page and where the money goes. Then go to www.dogfoodanalysis.com and look for a dog food you would like to feed based on their ratings. Stay within the 5 to 6 star range to avoid crappy ingredients.     A few suggested foods:   Taste of the wild(sold at feed stores typically)  Innova(sometimes seen at petland)  Chicken soup for the dog lovers soul (typically sold at feed stores)  Solid gold (typically sold at petco)  Wellness (typically sold at petco)  Blue buffalo(typically sold at petsmart)|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Home prepared food is best. I am fifty-five years old and have had dogs since a small child. In those days they were feed table scraps along with bones and offcuts from the butcher. In those days non one ever heard of dogs getting cancer. Now, with dogs fed mass produced dog food, both dry and moist, cancer among dogs is the most common form of illness. I lost two dogs to cancer, and after my vet pointed out that it was only city/urban dogs that got cancer, that working dogs on farm never seemed to get it, I went back to the old way. Working dogs on farms are fed from slaughtered carcasses, uncooked plus a small amount of kibble.

I remember when our pet store opened like 15 years ago they had one. They lady bought it is local and took it everywhere. I havent ever seen anymore but im sure some states it is ok. I dont think it is right and its unfail to the animals.|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	Im pretty sure the answer is no.|`|6UMNhJnhaa	You should call the Californian Pet Control/Regulations Offices and check with them first.|`|g7karw44aa	I strongly disagree with keeping exotic animals as pets, but I am providing you with some information to read. I seriously hope you have looked into the reality of owning a monkey, its risks and costs. Most health insurance companies won't cover some illnesses if they know you have a monkey. Local housing agencies also prohibit monkeys, so check into that.    Please consider the following things before thinking about getting a monkey:  Unless you live in a large city that has an exotic Veterinarian specially trained to treat monkeys, you won't be able to take them to a regular vet office.     The cost: exotic animals are very expensive.  Keeping them, feeding them, providing medical care and everything else costs A LOT.  Do you have the necessary financial means to give your pet quality care?    Do you have the required vaccines to work with monkeys? Are you willing to take the risk of contracting a disease from your monkey or giving your monkey a disease?   Do you know about all of the viruses monkeys carry that can be transmitted to humans?     Are you prepared for a commitment to an animal that can life for 40-60 years?     Are you aware that 99% of the time monkeys turn very aggressive as they reach adulthood, even when hand reared and socialized well?     Will you be able to provide a very specialized diet?     Would you want to spend all of your life in a cage?  Monkey's don't live happily confined.    Can you handle the mess? Contrary to popular belief, monkeys are not easily house broken and even if they are, still throw their feces when angry, mark around the house and will get into everything.    For your sake and the animals, please do a lot of research before you make a final decision. Reading the pros of owning an exotic pet is not the same thing as understanding and being prepared for the cons. Most people don't understand what it truly takes to own an exotic pet or the toll it takes on the animals.    Please leave them in the wild where they belong.    http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/primates/...  http://monkeymaddness.com/articles/reali...  http://cdc.gov  http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/issues_faci...  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...
w1lh1INHaa	Your cat is ill if it is spilling litter, pooping on the floor and chewing paper.  She has been trying to tell you she is sick, and all you have done is scold her.  How would you feel if you told someone you weren't well and needed the doctor and all they did was get cross at you?    You need to get her to the vet for a check up and possibly some meds.  When she is feeling better, she will be more likely to come 'round.    And, when it comes to cats, bribery is fine.  You need to find a way to "apologize" to her for being cross, and if it takes bribery, then do it.  It will be her terms, no need to worry about that, but you need to do something to kick start the comeback.    Good luck, and please get her to a vet real soon for a check up.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	sorry, bribery is all a cat understands. you got mad, she gets even. treats, like beef, will win her back.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	As you might have already learned, a cat will only love you on their terms. It's just the way God made them! Don't allow a long time to pass while she is mad at you. I suggest sitting quietly near her and tossing treats to her. Or see if she'll play with a toy with you.  All the best!|`|BfpchxN2aa	What you can do is you can feed it one by one with the food. Pet it. Let it know you love it,
RzlaAklGaa	i would start by getting your bird's wings clipped. it's not expensive if you go to a groomer in a pet store (it does not hurt the bird at all). then i would just spend quality time with her in a closed room in the house like the bathroom. this will give her a chance to know that you won't hurt her.|`|v6coHbIeaa	Takes lots of work.|`|OxOIhuXEaa	yes    talk to it    give it treats so it knows you're good, not bad    lots of good sites on the net to tell you how|`|io0cByBvaa	yes, but i cant be bothered to type out teh whole process again, so maybe if u go tomy profile and look at some of my other answers, you'll see it there.  good luck

Adult birds dont adapt well to captivity, o at least that is so with the bald eagle. they're so reactive and flighty that it takes a skilled handler to work with them.    Golden eagles are not nearly as flighty as the balds. i'm sure the rule of younger birds adapt to captivity quicker is the same. they seam to be a tad more intelligent than balds, or at least less reactive.    to even keep these animals you have to be a master falconer. as far as bald eagles go. it is next to imposssible to get them as pets, they also are not used in falconry. Golden eagles are used in falconry and can take down deer. the can do alot of damage to game of a handler.|`|OfCgGpHYaa	You can tame any animal even a lion|`|Xb0GiTMuaa	No, you may be able to train one, but like any other wild creature, it will always have a free spirit.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Even if you could, I would find it depressing.

dfb64b243bd35b4224dd85cc89895d3daa	Reddish / orange urine might be caused by the food you feed or some urinary tract disease.    Due to the high concentration of beta carotene from carrots, their urine most probably turned reddish/Orange. High amount of nitrate food will also caused this problem.    Suggestions:     a) Try to change their dietd. Feed them some alfalfa grass, pellets or hay and occasionally some fresh vegetables (Make sure you remove the chemicals from the vegetables before feeding them).    b) If this doesn't help, then send your rabbits to the vet for a thorough check-up.    c) remember to provide them with plenty of clean water, they need lots of water. Make sure the water is clean and filtered. Change the water daily|`|X2TnitFwaa	It's the carrots, but your rabbit should not be living on just carrots and/or pellets. In fact, those two things should make up very little parts of his diet.    The vast majority of his diet should be hay, with some green vegetables. You can give a little bit of pellets every day, but it should not be its main source of food.    The following links have some good information on rabbit nutrition. I strongly recommend you research this, as it's really  important in keeping your rabbit healthy.    http://mybunny.org/info/general.htm    http://mybunny.org/info/rabbit_nutrition...    Hope this helps :]|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Its from the carrots.  They cannot live on carrots for a week. You shouldn't let their food run out like that.|`|tT256JQRaa	its from the carrots, and it comes from other plants and foods too - its nothing to worry about unless they seem to be in pain, and usually clears itself up in 2 - 3 days  or it could be dehydrated, so make sure they have enough water.  if they do seem to be straining or in pain, then it could be a kidney or bladder infection and should be taken to the vets    heres a helpful website on red urine in rabbits for you  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	It's probably from the carrots, but im not exactly sure. I dont think they get periods. Have you fed them beats?

I notice around the time my rabbits have a litter they have a slight tinge of blood in their urine.    there is also a disease where rabbits get blood in their urine?    It could also be just from the carrots but personally id rather be safe than sorry. Get them checked by a Rabbit Specialist Vet as soon as you can.
OxOIhuXEaa	Hi    Sorry for your loss!    I think that if Molly was the daughter then Oli is maybe 4 and a half to 5 yrs? Well that's kinda old, but of course some guinea pigs live to ten and up, and 8 isn't rare. i think maybe don't get a new guinea pig as Oli is kinda old-ish so if maybe you get a new one, they become bonded, then Oli dies, well then the new one would be in grief. So maybe just leave it and give her lots of attention (I'm sure even though they are social, there are many happy solo guinea pigs!) or get a bonded pair and see if they become friends with Oli.    Hope I helped|`|05TcBSZbaa	My sister's mouse died, and her sister, my mouse is depressed. If your animals are constantly exercises, that mean that they are trying to work the sadness out.

dY7CX7qAaa	Over the counter medicine is all crap unfortunately.    You need to take your cat to a vet, to get wormed AND treated with vet quality flea and ticket medication.    Once a flea egg makes it way inside a cat, it becomes a parasitic worm.    So it's vital to do both at the same time.|`|AA10895169	Have to agree with the peeps ahead of me.. it is so unfair to adopt a pet and then let it suffer from neglect.

Do your cat a favor and find him a home where someone will actually care for him.  You need medication from the vet to get rid of the worms.  Failure to provide treatment for an animal is considered animal abuse.  You have no business owning a pet.   If your mother isn't willing to pay more than $20, I'm assuming your cats are not fixed or vaccinated as well.  This means that you are putting other people's pets at risk and contributing to pet overpopulation.|`|37p2xZYjaa	considering i'm an animal lover.  i'd call that neglect.  if the aspca found out about what your doing to that defenseless cat.  they'd probably charge you with animal cruelty and neglect.  and your MOM's god would surely not be happy with how she's not helping you with Goldie.  oh yeah and at least buy some flea killer. it's not expensive at all!|`|sp86FZckaa	Try to find out if there's a vet or shelter near you that would examine her to determine what's wrong with her for really cheap.    And you are right, if you turn her into a shelter she will not be better of.  I just adopted a cat from a shelter, they determined that she had worms, treated her once, and when I took her to a vet she still had them and she was at the shelter for three months.    However my cat did not have any symptoms.  She looked perfectly fine.  so I am afraid that you absolutely need to take her somewhere to get her chaecked out.  The good news is that the meds for her only cost $10, but the poop sample cost $30.  But I wonder, that if you do some research if you wont find someone who could do it for cheaper.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i love cats!|`|xshrKvIRaa	I know you didn't want to hear this answer, but you'll have to take a poop sample to the vet and have them do a fecal test on it, then they'll prescrible a one-time broad spectrum dewormer. Part of being a good pet owner, is taking the pet to the vet when it needs to, the cat can't take itself to the vet, so it relies on a responsible owner!|`|wA8g5mFNaa	If you can't give her proper care maybe you shouldn't have a pet. She is clearly suffering, and needs to see a vet.
McnuekTBaa	No, it is NOT normal, and your turtle is not hibernating.  Most turtles need to be kept very cold (below 40 degrees f) to hibernate properly.  During the winter, many inexperienced reptile keepers let their temperatures drop, which causes reptiles to become sluggish and stop eating. These keepers mistakenly think their reptiles are hibernating, when in actuality, they are usually dying.  Your turtle is not hibernating. You need to raise the temperatures, and research proper care of this species!  This site will help:  http://www.redearslider.com/|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	I can almost guarantee your temps are too low, get a thermometer and possibly a basking light or water heater.  Cold turtles get very sluggish, and they need the higher temps to digest.    Also make sure you have a UVB producing light on him.  They need it to metabolize calcium and this is ESPECIALLY important for baby turtles for proper shell development.|`|3zEKZNFsaa	Depending on what kind of turtle and where you live.  It is probably trying to hibernate.  We have one and he goes into slow eating and sleep mode around November and comes out of it March or April when it starts to warm up.  Then they are veracious about eating.  What I do is check on him every so often and make sure he wakes if disturbed, that way I know he is still alive, just in peaceful slumber.|`|Wc1fn2KDaa	my brothers turtle is like this it is always asleep and mine is soo active.

AA11565057	It sounds like you've really been doing your research - way to go!    I can't believe the number of idiots who think that hampster cages or bright plastic ill-ventilated cages are better just because they're bright and cheery >.    I think that cage looks fine. As far as size goes, you should have at least 2 cubic feet per rat, and the bigger the better. I think that cage would be fine, but do make sure you give them plenty of outside time!    If you're buying from a breeder and have researched enough to know about cages, I think you'll be fine :)|`|ig756kyCaa	sure but go to pet smart|`|MNw4ejFbaa	i have rats and i just got a hamster cage he loves it and it works perfectly, buy second hand trust me|`|ajJViUbcaa	Personally I think that cage would be great for smaller critters than being for adult sized rats.    The cage you picked out is 24"inches long and only 14" wide.  An adult sized rat is usually between 6"- 8" long from nose to butt, and their tail is about as long as their bodies..giving a total length of one rat 12"- 16".  The cage isn't wide enough.|`|26PPwzrWaa	You can build a C&C cage for rats by using mesh grids.     Here is the link:   http://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/rats...|`|FWlSFpByaa	IT's AWESOME! its a great cage but the little wire squares might make there toes get stuck! Just check it out i guess|`|KeIzAmuVaa	they all are so depressing.................cant u find a cage with tu  nels and colors ....like a miniature chuckey cheese lol|`|cnCnSsWraa	i think the 1 named ''the rat tower'' is the best those little fluffys will have plenty space there.|`|nVI0Stvzaa	The Rat Tower is a good size. I ended up adding an addition onto mine that doesn't have any shelves so my boys could climb the walls without running into any shelves...the full middle floor of the Martin's cage prevents this. Honestly, it's actually pretty easy and cheap to make a cage (at least cheaper than a $80 Martin's Cage).     Go to Home Depot or Lowes and ask for "Hardware cloth" or wire mesh, I think it's in the home and garden section. I know Home Depot has it because that's where I got the mesh for the addition I added to mine. Make sure you get pvc coated stuff, not the shiny metal, because plain metal gets really stinky when peed on (for that matter, if you do get a Martin's cage, make sure you spend the extra money for powder coated. Trust me.) Get 2 rolls or so of that. Also get some zip ties (get lots, they're cheap) for holding it together, a metal file, and a pair of wire cutters (if you can borrow the file and cutters from someone, that's even better). Then, go to a dollar store and get an "under the bed box"- make sure it's at least 12 x 24 inches, but the bigger the better.    Okay, measure out how big you need to make all four sides. If you have a 12 x 24 inch under the bed box, cut two panels 24 inches long and two panels 12 inches long. Cut one panel 12 x 24 inches for the top (the under the bed box will be the bottom, so you don't need a panel for that). Cut a pretty big hole in the front for a door and cut a panel slightly larger than the hole. Cut some smaller panels for shelves and ramps (as many as you want). Put it all together with the zip ties (attach the shelves and ramps to the sides before putting all the sides together). Attach the door panel loosely on one side with the zip ties (for the "hinges") and use a twistie tie (like what you find on a loaf of bread) to hold the door shut. There are lots of websites online with plans for pet cages so you can make them yourself. It takes some time and effort, but it's cheaper than buying one and you get to customize it however you want it. Oh, and also at the hardware store, consider getting some linoleum tiles to cover your shelves so that your ratties don't have to walk on wire all the time.    Anyway, to answer your question, yes that cage is a good one. But if you're going for cheap, try making one yourself...plus making one gives you bragging rights in front of all your friends. Have fun!

EJSdI25Naa	Your poor birds are being turned into lunatics by the sheer boredom of the existence you provide for them. Please, do not cut their wings. Can you not construct some sort of outside aviary where they can flex their muscles and have little flights? Provide them with some opportunity to think about. They have their wings naturally and to deprive them of their last tie with their own intended existence is just too cruel.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Some people do it to prevent their birds from flying out a door or window. Accidents happen especially when the birds are allowed to be free roaming.     Wing trimming is not painful in any way, It is not permanent either. So if you don't like it they grow back. Doesn't take long so don't worry.    Have someone teach you how to hold the bird and trim the wing without hurting the bird or cutting the blood feathers....only certain feathers are cut.    You don't have to if you don't want to just keep that in mind.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	My certified avian vet told me if people could see the the birds she patches up weekly because their wings weren't clipped ,there would not be an unclipped bird in the country.     There seems to be some confusion about the term clipping wings by a few people here. Clipping wings does does NOT mean damaging the actual wing structure of the bird to prevent flying. It means to clip the flight feathers shorter so the bird cannot obtain lift to fly away.It doesn't hurt and the feathers will grow back.  If done right the bird will glide smoothly to the floor but will not be able to fly upwards for more than a few feet. However do not rely on wing clipping to prevent your bird from flying away outdoors. A frightened bird can & will fly with clipped wings, get caught up in a breeze and disappear.|`|AA12283580	NO! You do NOT want to injure them! And you especially DON'T want them to attack you.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I think it just depends on your situation.  If your birds are in a safe, closed room/environment with no chance of escape or injury I wouldn't clip them.  My budgies' cage is open constantly so they can have all the freedom they want.  I live in a dormitory, and I am strict about guests knocking!  My roommate and I have clipped their wings before, but we like them to have fun/freedom so we haven't recently been doing it.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Absolutely as soon as possible.  It is for their safety.  It only takes ONE time to fly out the door, into a pan on the stove, be hit by a ceiling fan, or meet up with one of your other pets on the floor,  even if mine climbs down my 5 dogs don't bother him, but you never know for sure with other animals.  I have always keep my birds wings clipped on both sides with no problems.  I also think it makes them more tame.|`|1lP9ALI1aa	i wouldnt    as long as there is no opend windows or ne thing lik that, then its good    unless ur birds go nutzycoocoo|`|sTKJkvFsaa	If you want to be safe, have a leash-type thing attached. Put a thing around their legs and make the cord attaching the leg and the wall or floor really long so they have enough place to fly around. that way, they wont go away and you wont have to hurt them by clipping their wings.|`|AA10566881	If there is a window that the cockatiels can fly into, then I would say yes, clip the wings.  I was overdue on clipping the wings of a cockatiel and she flew into a window and broke her neck.  She died in my hands.  I would hate for that to happen to anyone else.  I know I don't have to tell you how upset I was.  Cockatiels tend to be nervous and fly off when they are startled, so there was absolutely no warning.  If you don't think the cockatiels will fly into anything, then you're all set.  It is totally NOT cruel to clip their wings if they are in danger of hurting themselves when they fly.  Pet birds are not like wild birds with longings to fly off into the wild blue.  Pet birds like to be around their people and their cages.  If they do fly off outdoors, more than likely, they won't make it very long because they simply don't know how to live as wild birds.  Oh!  One more thing:  You don't have to clip their wings too severely, just enough so that they can't get a good speed going and smash into something.  The previous advice on how to do it is good.  Good luck and enjoy your dear birds!  You are a wonderful owner to want to do the very best for them.|`|WvqTPpAYaa	It all depends on what you want, and there are pros and cons for either decision. If you are taming your 'tiels you could clip their wings so they cant fly away from you as quick. Also,birds that can fly away from you seem to challenge you more and it can become exhausting having to chase the bird around. Wing clipping can also keep the bird from crashing into a window or getting hit by the fan. When the bird's wings are clipped it doesn't stop them from completely flying. It actually just lets them glide a little for a softer land.     The only bad thing about this is if you have bigger animals in the house that could potentially hurt or kill your bird. If they are always just in your room or there are no animals in the house then it's really all up to you. Also, their wings grow back at a pretty fast rate so it's not like they'll be like that forever. More like a few months.     You should check with a vet for them to show you how to di it, but it's really quite simple.|`|dLXKNEmHaa	i dont think you need to. if you are taming or training the birds, than yes to prevent  injuries. Your birds seem like the are calm and used to being around.  good luck!|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	No, I don't think you should clip them. You're right, it is sad. As long as you are careful about doors/windows, they should be fine. I don't clip any of my birds, and for my large parrot I have a harness for going outside.    Good luck with your decision.    Edit - Also, if things are going fine as they are now unclipped, why change it anyways? You're not doing anything wrong by keeping things the same.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	Here's what I've done.  Clip their wings.  You don't need to clip to far back, just enough to flutter a few feet, and do *both* wings so they are not lop-sided when they fly.    Let them spend time familiarizing themselves with the room they intend to play in.  Overtime, birds will learn and understand their room's spacial limitations.  Cover mirrors and windows.      In the meantime, their wing feathers will grow back.  When they have returned, your birds should be familiar enough with your room not to have a "freak out" that could damage them.    However, if you for any reason intend to take your birds outside your home (to the vet for instance), CLIP THEM!!!  You don't want the heartbreak of losing your bird.  Those feathers will return.|`|Hv7L5CrGaa	Do what's right and clip your bird's wings. It's safer this way, and better for your bird. Find a avian vet or someone professional to clip the bird's wings.

You only clip the tip of one wing, not really necessary for both, mine already had his clipped when I bought him off a vet, he can still fly but not very well. It's better also instead of having your bird flying around the house pooping and taking hours to catch, mine enjoys whistling out of his cage and I have a better relationship with him because I can pick him up and he won't fly off.  , Don't forget birds wings grow back....|`|EGNgIfjKaa	halukseekerbear wrote:  [ If you want to be safe, have a leash-type thing attached.

This won't prevent the bird from trying to fly away as fast as possible and it will most likely hurt itself badly when the cord suddenly goes taut.

6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Sounds like you have an "early maturing" KITTEN!!  These sound like the classic signs of "heat".  Some kittens have their first "heat" at 4-5 months and CAN (but should NOT) get pregnant!!    Kittens that get pregnant and TRY to have a litter before their bodies are fully prepared, run the risk of dying.  Cats do NOT have to have a litter of kittens before being spayed.  THEY do NOT know the difference, and a spayed cat has a decreased chance of developing CANCER of the uterus and mammary (breast) glands in later years.    So, unless you want to go through this "drama" every few weeks (seemingly) forever, get her spayed SOON..........You won't be sorry.  She'll live a HEALTHIER, happier life (you, too)....    Take her to the vet on Monday and have her spayed!  Until then, do NOT let her get outside, or she won't come home for a week or so!  AND, then she'll be pregnant.    Hope this helps.......Good luck.|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	Oh yes, your baby is in heat.  That fact about her not getting spayed until she is 6 months old is old news.  The new fact is that kitten as young a 3-4 months can come into heat and have kittens.  In fact I just adopted a Mother and daughter (bonded pair) and Mooiepoots has Loki at 3.5 months old.  It was just such good luck (for me) that Mooiepoots was found by animal rescuers and was able to have a successful birth.|`|f1SWISQYaa	Shes a kitten, she wants to play, if her stomach is on the ground and rear is up that means he about to attack, but if your worried call the vet|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i love cats!|`|zeTGmB3faa	It does sound like she is in heat. Some cats do go into heat this early. You will need to be very careful not to let her outside or near an unaltered male cat. Getting pregnant this young would probably kill her and the kittens would not be carried full term. You can have her spayed during a heat cycle but vets prefer to wait. She will be in heat for about 3 weeks. She can be spayed at this age. Please do it ASAP.|`|f63f9f351cf19e94cff59963c9708a3daa	awwwhhhh!!!....it'd be sad if she were in pain or something..i'm sorry i dont know whats wrong, but i've had kittens before and my one kitten was 7 months or soemthing when she gave birth to some more kittnes...she was just naturally tiny so it freaked me out when she was all over the male cat...ughh...creepppyyyy...XD|`|w1lh1INHaa	Yes, your cat is in heat, as females can go into heat as early as three months.  Call the vet and make an appointment for about 2-3 weeks from now for spaying, as females can go into heat every 3-4 weeks, and it is easier and cheaper to have her spayed when she isn't in heat.    No need for the vet tonight, but in a few weeks, definitely.    There really isn't too much you can do, I'm afraid.  You can try rubbing her belly a little, but it is something you really can't help with.

xyPpruSjaa	Hi! Here's an example:    http://twinsqueaks.com/split-tank.html    Here's MY personal experience of making one, it looks really long and hard, but it only took me like 20 minutes xD    I took measurements of the aquarium. You need to find the width and the height.     I went to the hardware store. I told the people the measurements and to save money they cut me a big piece and I just cut the measurements myself with some wire cutters or tin snips. If you don't want sore hands, I suggest you let them cut it xD I made 2 sheets for extra protection.    I went to an office supply store. I bought those transparent report covers. I put away the report covers as you won't need them here, what you WILL need are those plastic slidy things (I have an excellent vocabulary) that hold the report together and I slid them onto the bottom and sides of the mesh to protect the gerbils' that I was introducing eyes and so that it wouldn't scrape against the glass and make scratch marks.     I wedged the squares into the aquarium. They should fit pretty snugly.     I added bedding, water bottles, food bowls, and wheels on each side.     To attach a water bottle to your aquarium buy some sticky backed WHITE velcro, sold at the hardware store for like 3 dollars.    Good luck!

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    The bedding is just going to be sitting in the cage - it's just fine.  We change bedding once a week because it gets soiled with a hamster in the cage - therefor no hamster = clean bedding and no problem.    The biggest concern I have is whether or not you not only cleaned, but *sterilized* the cage.  When an animal dies in a cage, from whatever cause, you should discard any non-plastic, glass or ceramic items (ie wooden, cardboard, straw, chew sticks or treats).    Mix hot water 50/50 with bleach and soak all the place the entire cage and any of the plastic, glass or ceramic items in it for about 5-10 mins to kill any germs. Rinse it all 4-5 times to remove any traces of bleach, then replace the sterilized items and new bedding and nesting material.  You can then put in new wooden chew toys, treats, grass houses, etc.    This way you'll be sure that there's nothing dangerous that could cause a problem for your new hamster :)    Good luck|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Yes the bedding will be fine but just to be sure so that your next/new hamster wont die as soon, put a fresh small coating over top of the rest. Your new hamster will be as happy as ever!|`|HF0oDEd0aa	pine wood is to rough but useing the bedding is softer on them but still put a ltittle bit of pine wood|`|WFzt2fHOaa	I'm sorry you lost your hamster.

gwDftPBsaa	Clover oil. Put your fish in a bucket or bowl with the tank water in of course then add clover oil to it. Its a painless death.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Yes, unfortunately when it comes to dropsy sometimes euthanizing is the best course of action.    The most humane method is to use clove oil. By adding ten drops per gallon of water you can put the fish under (fish surgeons do this) to euthanize the fish you have to OD him on clove oil. Wait until all gill movement has ceased.    Freezing, or flushing is not an acceptable form of euthanasia.    ~The exact cause of dropsy is unknown. But it is a bacterial infection that has been linked to water quality issues. Remember to regularly perform partial water changes and test your water.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	There's a product called "Euthanase" designed for putting down hopelessly ill fish. The active ingredient is clove oil (not clover oil), which acts on fish as an anesthetic. You put the fish in a small bowl of water and add drops of Euthanase until the fish stops breathing.    I've also heard of putting a fish in strong alcoholic spirits, such as vodka or whiskey. Alcohol is also an anesthetic, so it should have much the same effect.    Another method some people use is to put the fish in a small bowl of water and add several effervescent tablets, such as Alka-Seltzer, for example. The bubbles this produces are carbon dioxide, and it will asphyxiate the fish in a very short time. I don't know if this is completely painless, but it's fast, so I'm going to call it reasonably humane.    Dropsy is a symptom, not a disease. It's a sign that the fish is no longer able to regulate the amount of water in its tissues (this is called edema in both fish and people), and can result from a wide number of different causes. In most cases, it doesn't seem to spread to other fish in the tank.    Sorry about your fish. I hope this helps.|`|vp0WdER8aa	the safest and most harmless way is freezing him, NOW BEFORE ANYONE THUMBS ME DOWN LET ME EXPLAIN,     goldfish are coldwater fish and dont feel temp. differences like us humans or other animals, of course they feel the temp. rasing up but they dont feel it going down since they are already coldwater fish.  now what i did to my fish was take a small ziploc bag, add water from the tank and add the fish.  place the bag in the freezer and wait 2 hours.  your fish should be frozen to death, but its ok because they havent felt any pain and i know this because many other fish owners and experts told me about this    i am sure my 3 fish in the past had felt nothing when i did this to them, i am not a bad fish owner, in fact putting your fish to sleep this way is the best thing you could do for him because he wont have to suffer anymore pain and it will be over soon    i feel your sadness, my fish had to be put to rest because of dropsy also, i was so sad :( anyways, i am sorry for your fish, take care :P|`|gQongGHUaa	dropsy fomrs when the fish is kept in poor water comditions.  i would test your water for nitrites, nitrates, and ammonia.  all of  these can cuase dropsy.  also, not getting enough oxygen can cause this.  for example, when the filter is accidentaly turned off,  the fish will try to store oxygen in its body.  however if he stores to much of it, not all of it can be released.  i would reccoment keeping high oxygen levels in your tank and doin 25 percent water changes daily.  the fish may get better, you never know.  also, adding some aqaurium salt to the tank will add electro-lights and make his healing a little more enjoyable.  do not try to kill him.  the best way is to let them die on there own.  just remeber to do the 35 percent water changes,  add the salt, and keep the water well oxygenated.  this should lead to a healthier fish in about 2-3 weeks if done properly.  it is not contageous|`|AraBfesHaa	Well, if you haven't done anything to it yet, give it a salt bath that will draw some of the excess water out of it.  And right, it's an excess of water.  Mardel makes a medication called Maracyn-2.  Personally it's the only thing I've ever seen that specifies it's used for Dropsy.  I've used it a couple of time and it has taken care of the problem.  The main thing is to catch it in time before the kidneys fail.    Now I'm sad :(  It bring me back to the time we lost a pleco to dropsy before we knew what it was.  Believe me, I did alot of research on it after that!  I always have maracyn 2 at the house.  Never without it.  It also treats a variety of other diseases, even more than it says on the box.  It's a little pricey, but worth it.  You can get it at petsmart, and petco, but not walmart.

XPB6Ogj0aa	I am saying yes.  But first, the kitty at the vets, how old was it.  Was it older than 6-7 months?  A very young kitten may not be the best idea.  The kitten will have learned how to interact with other species yet.  An older kitten or an adult cat would be best.    Now you really have to soul search.  Do you have enough energy, time, finances and dedication to take care and socialize a new addition to the family.  If you truthfully can say yes, JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET.    As far as the baby is concerned, children need to know how to interact with animals and the younger they learn the better.  Besides have you ever noticed that animals will put up with a lot more from babies than they will from children or adults.  A baby can pull on a kitty and the kitty will walk away.

There is always room for one more cat.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	As much as I know how it is to want a kitten, or more than one ( I have 11 indoor cats ), I have to say this............    Your fiance is right....AT THIS TIME.  A kitten and a 10 month old just do NOT go together.  You need to wait until you have a chance to TEACH your child how to interact with the two animals that you already have.  Teach him (her?) to RUB the animals, not pet ( kids have no idea how hard they pet ), and when he/she starts to run around the house, a kitten will be traumatized.  Kittens are "fragile" and toddlers can hurt them without even meaning to...Your cat probably doesn't play well, because she doesn't want to get hurt, or hurt the child..............    So, wait another couple of years to get another animal.  Maybe, by that time, you'll be living in a larger place, with more room for "everyone".    BE PATIENT........when your child is old enough to WANT a kitten, then you can decide if he/she knows how to treat one.........    Hope this helps.......Good luck.
zdBInQReaa	I will ask the rabbits in my backyard to make more bunnies and maybe one will be hypo-allergenic! if that does not work, I will contact my neighbor, she has 50+ show bunnies!|`|t6xWtEPtaa	I'LL DO IT!!  Hmm... I'll cross a plush bunny with a Cadbury Creme Egg.    Gonna cost you a pretty penny though.....   :D|`|OxOIhuXEaa	sure!    i'll get a hypo-allergenic male rabbit and give it to my female rabbit, and maybe they'll be half hypo-allergenic!
ywSPNPl6aa	Whenever my husky wants attention, he'll put his head on my hand until I pet him.    And what I love most about my pets is that they will forever be by my side and will never betray me. They will always be with me whether I'm bad or good.|`|aBh7uZkuaa	the thing i love most about my pets is that they will always be with you no matter what.

For me its cats and i really don't have to do much just feed them.|`|PpCTpuwSaa	Hey   I think u already know this but my cat tries to suck my hair, trying to get milk out of it. He also eats everything including bagels and carrots.|`|6UMNhJnhaa	How loveable my dogs are and how they have their own little personalities. I swear, sometimes I can even see them smile and frown. They have just as many emotions as humans They are beautiful creatures and treat any human (almost) the same!|`|cPPw5st1aa	my parakeet gives me a kiss ! he will peck my top lip its sooooo cute!

They are sisters but they don't always get along like most sisters. They snuggle up to each other when they're sleeping and they like to chase each other around and play, but they fight over the wheel and take food from one another (they're not very good at sharing). There's Ruby- a fawn hooded and the smallest, Mae-Belle- a black and white dalmation, and Alice- a PEW (pink-eyed-white).  Mae is the most outgoing and explorative rat that I have ever met. She likes to climb around and never sit still! Ruby, is quite different. She likes to sleep more than anything and would rather cuddle up next to me while I scratch her ears. Alice has many different sides to her. She's stubborn and the dominant rat in the house, but she gets scared easier than the other too (Mae never gets scared) and never leaves my side when she's out because of it. I handled them all equally since I got them at 6 weeks old (January 4) so that shouldn't be the reason why she gets so scared and nervous. That's just how she is.    The thing I love most about my rats is when I walk into the room, they all run toward the door of the cage because they know that I'm going to give them treats. It just makes me feel loved when they get so excited to see me :)|`|xyPpruSjaa	It's so funny when my gerbils try to climb onto my face when I hold them! And when they sniff it tickles so much :]    And when I hold my hamster, he climbs right up to my shoulder and onto my back! Once he went into the hood of my sweatshirt!     :D
8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	Here is a really good website about sea monkeys.     Sometimes Sea-Monkeys take their own sweet time to hatch. Occasionally it takes up to 72 hours.

LAXxaxAZaa	They make bits with a rubber mouthpiece instead of metal. I've never used one, but I'm sure that would be softer.    Here's one example, but they come in a lot of different styles.  http://www.horsetackinternational.com/im...    But I would also try to watch your hands. Keep your hands soft, and use your arm muscles instead. A bit is only as harsh as your hands.|`|FWlSFpByaa	I believe Curb bits are nice but also Junior CowHorse Bit    http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...|`|5eNGp8TRaa	Rubber mouth full cheek:   http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...

Black iron snaffle:  http://www.horsetackinternational.com/Fu...    Horses usually like the black iron.

I'd stick to a snaffle.|`|JL6GXFJOaa	ooh no curbs! that is not soft at all! Well, I dont' know why you say no O rings, but that is the softest. Here is a great one. http://www.sstack.com/shopping/product/d...  You want just a regular joint in the middle. You can also get this in a full cheek and a D ring. Double jointed is even softer. You have to think about how the bit is going to "break" in the horses' mouth. Double join will break more smothely and into 3 peices. One joint breaks into 2. And a curb basically pushes against the roof of the mouth to get the head to lower.

MUfMJYHGaa	It's probably arthritis. You can get him joint supplements and keep him blanketed when it's cold. Have your vet look at him and see if a feed thru or injectable joint  supplement is your best call (Adaquan, Legend ) Look at your feed regimen too. He may need a "warmer" feed ( a little corn , alfalfa) to help him out. Some older horses also have circulatory problems.He may need some horsey "Geritol".|`|JFuVm9k5aa	40mins to an hour is a long time for a horse to warm up unless wuite elderly/moderate to severe arthritis. my 13y/o QH had moderate arthritis in the hock and fetlock and he onlt take about 20 minutes to get where i want him. and the rest of the year his joint supplements/massages/chiropractic adjustments/acupuncture/and adequan and legend shots take good care of him. he is an event horse and gets along nicely for an arthritic, and aging QH.    you didnt mention his age/show or riding history or breed so i cannot helpt you. as far as keeping him warm...blankets?     to lubricate his joints get a supplement if that is the issue.     to help inflamation etc get a joint supplement  you need him to see a vet to see exactly what the stiffness is coming from..previous injury? arthritis? not lubricated joints? muscle stiffness? it could be many things. have them pin point the problem and then you can better help your guy.    also a good joint support supplement and regular adjustments from a chiropractor and masseuse do horses wonders...no matter what age/level/disipline/breed etc. i treat my yearling to adjustments once in a while to prevents injury he can cause from getting himself "out of wacjk" in the pasture.      hope i helped :)    **EDIT**    try platinum performance or platinum performance complete joint. works wonders for all my horses (use the CJ on my competition horses)  16 is a rather good age to be developing some stiffness.  try the Platinum performance complete joint. read about it and you wll iunderstand how it works so well. it is EVERYTHING in one. vitimins, minerals, joint, muscle, antioxidants, etc.  try that and if no imporvement you may need to loominto adequan and legend shots    p.s. i have NEVER heard of using polo wraps for keeping a horse warm...    as long as he is blanketed on cold nights he should be fine.   here is the link...    http://platinumperformance.com/animal/eq...|`|qeR967J7aa	There are some stretches you can do with him before you ride.  Kindof hard to describe.  But the best thing is either a heat linament, or making a soaking stocking.  Just take a tractor inner tube, sew it closed with steel wire at one end [ rolled over, so it holds water].  At the other end, make a strap to slip over the haunches [ cover with sheepskin-- old saddle pad ].  On the crossties, or with a helper, slip it on like a sock over the hock.  Fill with very warm water and epsom salts.  She might be shy at first, but my horses beg for their soak.  Just leave on till the water cools or 20 mins, while you finish barn chores.|`|ajJViUbcaa	You don't mention how old he is or what type of work he's been used for most of his life.  Both of which might be the cause of stiffing up during the cold months.  And as you mentioned he is getting older and is older than what he was last Summer, Spring or Fall.    Ask your vet to come out and give your horse an exam. They may recommend putting him on a supplement to help this issue.
ADLupVviaa	Yeah its normal for dogs. My Schnauzer has never had them so far but my 2 year old staffy still gets them.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Often if a dog eats or drinks too quickly, he can get hiccups. Your dog is still young, so he probably just eats like a puppy. (By that I mean very quickly.) It's normal. I think dog hiccups are cute.|`|GfJXUkh5aa	It probably is... my dog belches and farts.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	try not to worry he will grow out of it as he gets closer to being an adult.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	yep its normal. we have an ebd that gets them all the time. it could be due to eating habits. if he eats fast thats a leading contributor. but its nothing major.|`|RoDjZKknaa	My dog got hiccups a lot as a puppy, less now, but still every once in a while.  She is the first dog I've ever had that gets them too!  She is a Border Collie Queensland cross, don't know what gets her going.  She is a kick tho!|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Yep, it's true. Dogs can and do get hiccups. My dog has had the hiccups before.
x8Vgu6acaa	I have dogs because I like their company.  When I am at home my dogs are inside with me.  If I go somewhere that the dogs are allowed the dogs go with me.    If I am going to be away for a while, such as work, and the dogs are large enough, they are outside in a secure yard with food, water, shade & shelter unless the weather is bad.  But as soon as I get home. they are inside.    I see no point in having a dog if it is relegated to be banned from my presence except for a few moment of feeding/or playing.  Dogs NEED to be with their people to be happy.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Keeping dogs outside only defeats the purpose of having a dog.  They are not part of the family & don't provide any companionship to you or receive any from you.    Not cleaning up except when you don't want to be embarrassed causes them to live in filthy conditions & prone to infection & other illnesses.  Why bother having dogs in the first place?  They can't offer any protection except for the backyard.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	I consider my dogs to be more outside dogs than inside dogs - 1 Kelpie and 1 Malinois.  Having said that my Malinois is lying beside me sleeping while I type this and the Kelpie is in the lounge room I think or he may have taken himself back outside, no sorry he just let himself out of my bedroom (my husband is in there having a nap - the dogs aren't usually allowed in the bedrooms).    Anyway, they sleep outside on the verandah on their dog beds (if they choose) and they are outside while everyone is at work / school.  They are not tied up as we have 5 fully fenced acres for them to roam in but they tend to stay at the house.    When we are home the doors are usually open for them to come and go as they please.  If they start getting too rambunctious inside they may be put outside to play.    This set up works for our family.  We live in a tropical climate so, even in winter, it doesn't get too cold and in winter we put a blanket on their beds if they want to snuggle into it.  If we do have a night or two of "really cold weather" - 10 degrees celcius then the dogs will sleep in the laundry.|`|JsBb732Maa	Out side is fine if you have all that they need, and they get attention.|`|eQaApazjaa	as long as its not that cold where u live..if i was to keep any dog outside where i live it would be VERY cruel. its freeeeezing here. and snowy =[    so as long as its a good temperature and they have space to move around and what not then i dont think its cruel at all. those breeds probably like being outside more than being inside    a lot of ppl only think its cruel bc they associate rottweilers and pitbulls with being tied up and stuff|`|KFu7596Paa	i keep mine inside were it's warm but there only small mixed terriers  and at mo in uk to cold for them out side    your dogs are big with padding rottys are big and chunky and pitts im not really sure but they look like chunky dogs too me only from pics     as long as your dogs have proper bedding and a good suply of food and water and a good shelter they should be fine.     your pitts sound like they share body heat and the rotty will be fine     i dont thnk if your dogs looked are after that living outside is cruel     my dogs would freeze to death out side as its cold and they are smaller breeds dont listen to comments about it being cruel. working dogs like hunting dogs live outside    good luck|`|xxr2Zflvaa	i dont think its curel as long as your giving your dog love and attention  but some nights when its really cold outside i would bring them in. but those dogs are big dogs and they would most likely enjoy running around outside then being cooped up indoors all day.|`|Kp02lQxeaa	depending on the weather in your area it may be fine.  i also believe that pets should have plenty of interaction with people and that is why i choose to keep them indoors.  i am a believer that if a dog seems happier outside that is where it should live.  we had a collie/chow/wolf mix and he didn't like to be inside for any period of time.  he did however have a doghouse outside and access to our garage and chose to sleep there at night.  it is up to you but if you live in a very cold climate that has snow in the winter then you probably should bring your dogs in at night.  dogs with short coats are not equipped for extremely cold temperatures.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Mine get to stay where they want. And, most dogs really like being outdoors. Mine chose to stay out more than in so it can't be all that bad. There are even times when I want them to come inside and snuggle up next to me while I lay down, and they'd rather be outside playing.|`|FWlSFpByaa	I keep my Dog outside during the day but then let her in at night. You have short hair dogs, so they really should be inside|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs do not belong out side when it is 110 degrees or when it is below freezing and the wind is blowing. I can see an outdoor dog in Hawaii basking in the cool ocean breeze, but extremes of weather are cruel. Most outdoor dogs do not receive the socialization and attention they need. How long before the owner notices they have no water. Are they sick,lonely, injured,covered with fleas,would anyone notice? An owner with a house dog is more on top of things.|`|VNvVhDWgaa	Those are big dogs. Unless you have a big house, it's not unfair to keep them outside - except during extreme temperatures and weather conditions. My mom has about a dozen dogs, only 2 of them stay inside any part of the time and only one is a strictly indoor dog, except for potty time. They take extra precautions during the winter and summer months when it gets extremely cold or hot, and some of them are kept in a caged area where they have a doghouse that they all cluster in (of course, they're still puppies).    As long as you are providing a good, warm, safe place for them to sleep, they don't go without food or water, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with keeping a dog outside. In fact, some animals prefer to be outside rather than inside. My friend's golden retriever hated being inside. She would be constantly begging all day long to go outside.    My dog absolutely freaks out about going outside. He wants no part of it, he gets to the door and freezes and that's all she wrote. He just won't go, so i have to use potty pads in the house so he doesn't go on the floor.    We've had dogs most of my life, and we've had inside and outside dogs, and no problems with either or. It sounds like you're doing quite well with your pets (some people don't even bother to clean up their yards - gross), and as long as they still get a lot of love and attention, are receiving regular veterinary care, and are happy, then there's no reason you should worry.    If you have serious questions, you can contact the humane society in your area or local SPCA and have them come and look at your arrangements and let you know if there is anything they think you should change. They will be more than happy to do that, because they would rather be seeing a concerned pet owner trying to do the right thing, than someone abusing their animals any day of the week.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I feel it is breaking the pack. Just my personal opinion. Why have a dog if it isnt allowed to live with you in your den?|`|vFCQcRNEaa	I live in Alaska, and I have 21 outside dogs(though one of them is inside right now because he has a broken foot). I think it really depends on the breed, because if I have my dogs inside, they overheat and are miserable to get back outside.     I would not put hay in your dogs houses either, it's not warm enough. Use straw instead(it's hollow, so it insulates better). It's also cheaper!|`|MpxBbzb0aa	Where do you live?  I live in Chicago and having a pet outside in our extreme weathers is "pure cruelty"  Hope you don't live in a state with extreme weather.    I still believe no dogs should be kept outside, maybe is not cruelty, but is not nice either.|`|oK7HiwAiaa	My dogs live outside.  I'll admit, it makes me a little sad to separate them from their pack at night, but then I consider that I am the boss of the dog, and a dog living with a human has to learn all kinds of weird human rules anyway.  My dogs don't live in a dirty yard. I live out of town on a big block of land surrounded by bush and paddocks. my house is wide and open and the dogs can see us and we talk to them and they sit just inside the door when we are inside. Its unhealthy for a dog to live inside all of the time. Dogs are animals, they don't need to live inside. as long as they have shelter to sleep under they should be fine. Although I'm not opposed to dogs sleeping inside, a house is much cleaner without it.  If your worried about not interacting much with your dogs, maybe you should get out more. People need to live a healthy outdoor life as well.    I really don't like it when people forget that their dogs are animals. as much as they love their pets, people need to accept that dogs aren't equals, they are a companion that was domesticated to serve people, not the other way around. they do a good a good job of it too, and they love serving us.  The thought of a dog Living an artificial indoor human life makes me kind of sad. They were never meant to live that way.
B6zl0AJDaa	My VERY first horse was in her 20's when I got her and was 1/2 Standardbred, pigeon toed in front and base narrow in back.  The mare could trot faster than she could "gallup"...    If you keep splint boots on her when you're gaming her, shouldn't be a problem if the old splint is hard and set.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The money you pay up front for a horse is nothing compared to what you may spend on years of problems that conformation defects can produce.  Pigeon toes are a serious flaw.  Any angular deformity in the legs anywhere causes stresses that produce injuries that accumulate over time.  Farriers cannot "fix" pigeon toe deformity.  Any corrective farrier work throws off the angles of the joints inside of the hooves and legs, and causes inflammatory changes to occur. This horse already has a splint, which is the result of stress that most likely is associtated with the toed- in conformation. The splint may not be considered to be major in and of itself, but it reflects the weakness that bad joint angles represent. While it is true that perfect conformation is all but non- existent, angular deformities in the limbs are not the place to compromise.  I can forgive many imperfections, but I want straight legs from the ground on up. I would keep looking.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	The farrier can "fix" the pigeon toes (actually just making the horse look better, but my friend's horse is pigeon toed, farrier worked on that, and she wins dressage competitions all the time)  My horse has a splint.  Actually, i know many successful horses with splints.  it's no biggie.  My horse can do dressage, and a bunch of english stuff, she's not suited to jump, though.  another horse is a really good jumper.  She is a great jumper.  No, the splint won't stop the horse's success.  EDIT:  Just a little note to the second answerer....  All horses have at least one conformation fault.  If pigeon toedness is the only conformation fault, $1,500 is a great price!  Go for it.  I bought my splinty horse for $3,000 CAN.  the horse that jumps I was talking about was bought by that person for $4,000 CAN.  So, try her out. If you notice her being unsound, or something, then, don't get her.  If she seems fine, please, go ahead.  Too bad the economy's all screwy, hey?|`|IVbwUy9Xaa	Yes they do. I am sooo sorry to tell you this. Please, I am VEARY. But you asked this question for your own good. Truth- horses with splints in their legs should NOT be jumped or worked heavily. I had a horse with splints and they spread with work. They can be ridden, regardless, not heavily. Pigeon toes are not as bad. You should have a farrier and a vet come with you to check her out. Sound like a veary hard working horse. Very very very very very good price!    THANKIES :D|`|XL62syrCaa	The pigeon toes wont hurt her. The splint needs a large amount of rest to let it heal properly. Because of the splint and the pigeon toes I would not pay $1500 for her. Right now in this horse market horses (sound, well trained horses) are being given away! Actually half the time you can't even give them away. Local auctions are selling them for $75. So no you shouldn't buy her. Find a sound horse with no conformation faults.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Splint - If it is set (cold) and does not interfere with the tendon, it is a blemish, not an unsoundness. Pigeon Toes- If not severe, she should be capable of good work, but a pigeon toed horse will tend to "waddle" on the front end and seem a little heavy in front.It's probably what caused the splint.  Interference is common. Get her some shin boots.Ask yourself, is this a really capable horse that I can do things with or do I just like her because I've known her awhile? As much as we want to base a purchase on emotions( she's pretty! I feel sorry for him! I've always wanted a pinto!) it should be based on practicality. It's a big investment (time,money etc) and you need to keep long range goals in sight as well as immediate desires.
BIshtm7oaa	I think english riders sometimes need to relax a bit, but english riders probably think western riders need to be more serious. I think they are better riders overall because they pay more attention to equitation and stuff. They don't look any different then western riders except in clothing, and I think it is nice to dress up once and awhile, whether you are riding or not. I try to look nice at barrel races, a button down shirt and a nice pair of jeans, which is the western equivalent of breeches and a tux type shirt and riding jacket.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	I am primarily a western rider.  I mostly am a barrel racer, but have a very nice western pleasure horse.    When I was a teenager, I had no respect for any of the "pleasure" type riding.  HOWEVER!  When I got to college and it was forced upon me...I realized, "whoa"...this is amazing!  First, you do have to know what you're doing.  Second, everything can be related.    I took dressage and jumping classes in college.  Yes, getting your horse in the correct lead is oh so important for all disciplines, yes - riding with a nice elbow to bit line is important, yes - your leg position is important, yes - your horse's bend is important.  Ok...you get the idea.    Basically - I love riding english.  I think that dressage needs to be the basis of EVERY discipline.  My barrel horse went back to the basics and it helped her oodles.  I was training a horse that had been to the world show in western pleasure and his owner just about died when I told him I was bringing his horse to a schooling dressage show!  LOL!  It was great though and I think all horses AND RIDERs benefit from it.    Best wishes...|`|NevKx5fzaa	I have been riding my whole life and am jumping 4 feet and flying over a fence on horseback IS NOT BOARING!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes it is more prpoper but in westron all they care about is speed. I ride both. and me and my friends goofing off and jumping 4 feet bareback and in the saddle is FUN!!|`|wYBU1B1qaa	I grew up riding English and switched to Western about 7 years ago.  I just enjoyed it more and with an all day ride, found this discipline more functional.  The saddle is more comfortable and I can store everything my horse and I need for the day. I dont' worry about posting either way on a gaited horse so that wasn't the issue for me.  If someone wants to ride English, go for it.  I've pulled up where everyone else was on English saddles and in the tight pants, etc.  I saddled up my horse with my saddle and took off! :D  I think it's just a personal decision to whatever works for you, your horse and your type of riding.|`|c246ac86dcaacf7f923baa2e96250f43aa	Im sorry to say i think english people look very uncomfortable. i have tried english it was ok but not something i wanna do lol. I think it is boring lookin but i do jump a lil in a western saddle just for fun like logs on the trail. different to me but like i said it is my opinion. the clothes look VERY uncomfortable. I don't think you could get me in them lol.  I am a barrel racer and pole bender so i do all of the fast things with a horse. s but just opinions|`|MUfMJYHGaa	I do both..and bareback. It's not the style, it's the person. Sometimes I morph the two...English breeches in a western saddle as I hate riding in jeans. Tennis shoes in an English saddle.I do what's comfy.|`|kTtHlVa0aa	I ride almost always western. it is way more fun!! more relaxed, english is so up tight. english all they ever want to do is make there horse look good and put him in a lot unnatural positions. no horse likes to ride around in an area with his head pulled tight. riding should be about pleasure and having a good time for you and your horse. racing is also english and that should be illegal it is totally cruel and horses die and never know what its like to have fun. i've also seen english people who have never ridden out of the arena and the they do and there cry because there so scared. you should not be riding if you can't ride out of the arena!!|`|rTSwouqXaa	Well, if she is hot then I think.....Wow she looks good in those really tight pants! Ha. The few times I've been around English riders feeling a little full of themselves I take my horse over pretty much any jump they have, true cowboy style one handed with a whoop. Ha    I do enjoy watching english events. Anything where the athletic ability of the horse is showcased I will enjoy and respect.|`|VpfSbqhVaa	I've ridden hunter jump and western pleasure, on the same horse, on the same shows. I'm not used to tights or knee high boots,so I prefer western. Jumping is a real blast though. Anyhow, the other guy broke my balls about the tights, fuzzy helmet, and jacket. I would respond with "real men wear tights." Western people usually see English riders a prissy and stuck up. English riders usually see western riders as rednecks. There's always some drama at horse shows, but you're there so you and your horse can have fun, don't get to caught up in it.|`|IVbwUy9Xaa	Get ready for thumbs down- Although I am an English rider, I, myself have had problems with OTHER english riders. I think we are just as extreame as western and we both work very hard with our horses. We can be very much alike, but also extreamely different. We dress differently, and both oddly. I think you guys dress oddly and casual. You probably think we are fancy-shmacy and like to play dress up! But we ALL can have opinions and be friends. It really depends on the specific diseplin... I ride eventing- we dont exactly give a rip of cloathing!     THANKIES :D|`|FWlSFpByaa	English is very poised, it looks boring to me. Thats my opinion tho|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I grew up on a farm, and my dad just sorta threw me on a horse and said ride with very little instruction and definitely no helmet.  I think that BOTH styles of riding can be intense and skilled disciplines and BOTH can have their drawbacks.  However, something that has become a major pet peeve of mine (usually involving English riders) came from watching too many clips on youtube.com.  Anytime anyone rides without a helmet, no matter what they are doing, they are ridiculed and often it is by people who ride English (I know this sounds very judgemental, but honestly, how many western riders wear helmets?).  I have worked around horses and animals all my life, and while I think there are times a helmet is an extremely wise choice, there are other times that you just have to life a little!      Outside of that little soapbox of mine I honestly see English riders in much the same light as I see the people (like me) who ride Western (for whatever purpose they ride).    :)|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I have ridden, taught and trained both.  I believe that it is just as difficult to be a good rider at either discipline.  It is perhaps easier to be a beginning rider western, but to be an advanced rider of either takes great skill.  The only difference that I noticed is that it seemed easier to teach a western show rider to ride english, than to teach an english rider to ride western at a show level and the same for the horse.  Talking hunt seat here, never figured out why, just noticed it.|`|IWV6fnnJaa	I personally do both. I see the western as more free and rebel. But the English I see more so put together as well as controlled. I thing both are great ways of riding.|`|hwydxZnZaa	i started out riding western.. and i always thought that english riders were crazy for having to wear those funny helmets and those tight pants. and those saddles were hularious too! but i can always count on my mom to make me do something i think is horrible! so i started to ride english lol and it is actually quite fun even though the clothes and helmet are still funny looking
p1e15P7Laa	Well They Are So Tell Your Dad That U Do Not Want It Just Read This Article  Comment: Pro-Pit Mantra, "Cocker Spaniels Bite More Than Pit Bulls"  A reader at DogsBite.org recently commented on the often used pit bull advocate mantra: "But cocker spaniels bite more often than pit bulls!" We've all heard the mantra, the question is, what does it mean and what does it reveal about genetics, breeding, cocker spaniels and pit bulls? It reveals that "cocker rage" was primarily a result of indiscriminate breeding practices. Unlike pit bulls, however, spaniels were never bred for aggression or dogfighting.    Given the volume of indiscriminate breeding of pit bulls, plus a history of breeding for dogfighting, aggression and tenacity, are we supposed to believe that the pit bull's temperament and attack traits are not rooted in genetics? That instead, all of these traits were taught to the dog by its owner? Few people argue that the basis of the cocker spaniel's temperament problem is genetic. Pit bull advocates, however, refuse to apply this principle to their breed.  Comment: The American cocker spaniel started to become popular back in the 1940's, and as its popularity grew, so did the number of back yard breeders looking to cash in. The breed was a good choice for puppy mills and back yard breeders because of its relatively small size; you could cram a lot of them into small kennels in a tiny area, they didn't cost much to feed, and there was a constant, steady demand for them as pets. Today, we see them widely used to create mixed breed "designer" dogs such as the cockapoos by breeders whose only goal is to make money.    But this indiscriminate breeding came with a price...the breed suffered from serious temperament problems, and genetic seizure disorders like "rage syndrome", where the dogs suddenly lash out biting at anything near them. The breed standard for a cheerful, friendly companion dog was ignored by all of these bybers and puppy mills, and many of the dogs produced were nervous, snappish, fearful or otherwise unstable. Here is where the irony lies in the pit bull apologists argument that cockers are more dangerous than pits.    The basis of the American cocker spaniels temperament problems are genetic. Careless breeding created dogs with poor temperaments. No one was breeding cocker spaniels FOR aggressive temperaments, as guard dogs, as fighting dogs, etc. They were simply being bred to make money by filling a demand for a popular family pet; these were lap dogs, little old lady dogs, family dogs. No one was starving them to make them mean, chaining them in the back yard to a barrel, beating them or abusing them. They were not being fought, or used to guard drug operations. An aggressive temperament in a domesticated animal can result from careless or indiscriminate breeding, because temperament in domesticated animals is under a strong genetic control.    Yet according to pit bull advocacy groups, cocker spaniels as a BREED have aggressive temperaments, but pit bulls don't???? Pit bulls, which have been selectively bred for fighting another dog to the death in a pit, it seems, are unaffected by genetics. We can quantify and prove that MANY pit bull breeders are breeding dogs FOR human aggressive and/or dog aggressive temperaments, and the majority of those who are not SELECTING for aggression are not BREEDING AWAY from it. Yet, we are asked to believe that pit bulls could not possibly be suffering from the same problems as cocker spaniels.    The vast majority of pit bulls in the pet population were created by people who not only bred them carelessly, but often bred them for their dangerous aggressive temperaments. Pit bull advocates want us to believe that "its all how you raise them", and that only pit bulls who have been abused or not raised to be "nice" are dangerous. But how do they explain the biting cocker spaniels they are always talking about? Aunt Millie's nasty cocker was socialized, well loved and cared for when it nipped her grandchildren. Yet we are asked to believe, again and again, that the family pit bull that gets loose and mauls the neighbor must have been "trained" to do it.  According to WikiAnswers, 53 cases of US "cocker rage" have occurred in the last 17 years (this answer is likely invalid and was left by a pit bull advocate). Still, every day, at least several US citizens are severely injured by pit bulls. So in the last 15 days, pit bull rage has injured as many people as cocker rage has in 17 years. Much work has been done to eliminate cocker rage as well. The pit bull community, on the other hand, continues to breed for aggression.

cZE4lwROaa	Yes, almost positive it does!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4BBjhHAnaa	I recently got a lop.  He is very sweet.  He loves to run a lot, but he will also curl up with me and sleep or find some hidey-hole around the house to sleep in.    The great thing with a bunny, unlike a cat or dog, you can let it run around for a few hours and then put it back in its cage when you aren't around to watch it.    So far he is not trouble to care for at all.  He's just a baby, so he makes a little bit of a mess when he's out and about, but I am working on litter box training him.    It is more expensive to get them fixed, though, than other pets, but your humane society can probably recommend some good local vets.    Also, I recommend building your own cage rather than buying one. You get a better cage for a lot less, and you can get it done in one afternoon.  Feel free to email me for the specs I used.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	They make wonderful pets. They are warm and affectionate, gentle and loving animals. They are relatively easy to care for, but do require affection to thrive. I had 5, including a rescue. They thrive on love, and will pine away without it.|`|iR1pZ5VTaa	they are fantastic pets you can house train them or they live outside they dont need much care, just feed them once a day and if they are touilet trained change their litter once a week. but dont deal with very hot weather well|`|SGcUTVzPaa	Definitely. Pet store rabbits just aren't the same. Bunnies in general are adorable pets but they scratch and are kinda jumpy and wild. A lop will just sit in your lap. They are such sweeties. I've had about 7 or 8, I've lost track. I keep getting them because they make such great pets. Definitely get one, you'll love it. They're not hard to take care of, you just need to feed it of course and give it water, all the general stuff. Love it and care for it and it will love you right back! If you're looking for a specific kind of lop get a Holland Lop. Good luck.|`|vmm5kNc1aa	i have had 4 and yes they are good pets|`|OxOIhuXEaa	they  are lovely. But they have personalities so not all of them just lay there. Most pet shops don't let them run around so all they do is lay there.     I'm sure mine came from a pet shop (It's a long story how i got mine)  and she does not just lay there, she is very active  (mines a lop too)    So you'll need quite a big area for the rabbit to play    they aren't very hard to take care of    clean their hutch once a week, feed them everyday, play with them    yeah    Hope i helped|`|ACkUDrJbaa	Rabbits are awesome pets, they can be litter trained and trained even to do tricks. (My rabbit is an english angora and he begs and can jump through hoops) From experience if you want more of a pet the bigger size rabbits are more the way to go, as the smaller breeds are a bit skittish. But that also depends how much time you are willing to spend with him or her.   If you are happy to just watch your bun and not so much handle them thats fine too :)    Good luck with whatever you decide.
Ws2QPD0Iaa	Has your gerbil always had it?  If so, it's just hereditary.  It's called a "spiral" and it causes them no harm.  If the tail has broken, it will heal itself, it's nothing to worry about.  Just give your gerbil lots of lovin =]|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	The tail is more of a cartilage than a bone. Don't worry because it's most likely healed by now. Not much can be done now & it's okay if he isn't cosmetically perfect. He doesn't seem to be irritated by it and the worst of the pain is over & gone. Do not worry one ounce.|`|gTXUcd1maa	If your gerbil seems to be bothered by it, or the tail has a cut or anything, go to the vet, but other than that just keep and eye on his tail. Good luck!|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	If it is not bothering it don't worry about it but if it appears to be in pain or if there is open skin at the site take it to a vet so it can be amputated at the point it is broken and stop the pain or possible infection|`|zdBInQReaa	Don't worry! My school's pet mouse got his tail stepped on and he is FINE! sweetest little mouse ever!  Yes it is broken, but it is not in pain, I touch the mouse's tail every day and he does not even seem to mind it! Thank you for being a responsible pet owner and being concerned about your pet!
VHFf1dOMaa	Okay you might call me crazy but dogs often get sore after vaccinations.. One thing I can tell you works well in Dogs and Even Humans.... Soak a Tea bag in luke warm water, and apply it to the place where the dog got the shot, yeh it'll be a little messy but it's really awesome with helping the soreness and this often works with babies and children too.... or even adults who get shots... GOOD LUCK!|`|4LsF70cjaa	ASPIRIN IS BAD FOR DOGS AND CATS.  DO NOT GIVE WITHOUT VET APPROVAL AND ADVICE.  That being said, it sounds like your pup got a bad deal with this second go-round of shots.  He didn't act that way with the first ones, did he?  Anyway, give your vet a call in the morning for advice and just to get this documented for next time.  Good luck with your little guy!|`|YLYAo2zmaa	Dogs can take baby aspirin, but you need to ask your vet how much, an ice pack might be helpful applied to the injection site.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Some dogs react more strongly to their shots. Call the vet|`|IQjO3Weoaa	Doesn't sound it but he might just be overly-sensitive. Dogs react to needles in different way just like humans. Give your vet a call to be on the safe side.|`|Z3OTphZhaa	I had a dog like that.  After every shot, he did not want to be held or touched and if you did, he would yelp because he was so sore.  I contacted the vets and he said give him one baby aspirin (depending on weight of the dog).  Of course that is my vets recommendation and it seemed to help him, but I would contact yours to see what he recommends first.    Here is a link on baby aspirin:  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    Even with the link provided, please call you vet to get his/her suggestion.
jDPULfjKaa	basics    *20 gallon tank is too small. you need at least a 50 gallon tank, or a pen 4 ft long by 2 ft wide by 2 ft tall. get rid of the 20 gallon she would be severely cramped in there    *putting her outside when the weather is nice is NOT an option....UNLESS you live in a place that is very sunny like california, or florida. They need 4-5 hours of complete sunlight, like PURE sunlight at least every single day. if you live in a place that is not sunny, then you will need to bring her inside, keep her in an indoor pen, and purchase a SELF BALLASTED MERCURY VAPOR BULB + REFLECTOR FIXTURE.    it looks like this    the 100-150 watt bulb (around $50-$70 online, and $70+ in stores)  http://www.petmountain.com/shop/standard...    the reflector light fixture  http://www.f3images.com/IMD/250/ES67063/...    This is such a great bulb, really it is wonderful! it provides all the necessary UVA/UVB and heat rays she gets from the sun, but now in a bulb! So basically this is like a "sun in a bulb" You need to get this if you can not provide her with a 24/7 outdoor pen where she always has access to sunlight.    DIET: its more than veggies and fruits its basically 80% rough, slender weeds and plants that they get when grazing. you will need to grow your own plants to keep her healthy. weeds are very important to their diet because they provide LOADS of vitamins a, d and d3 they absolutely need for their development of a healthy shell. will she get sick? of course not! its their natural diet! but they can get sick from being fed the improper diet excluding plants and giving into nutrient poor items like veggies and  fruits. Read all about it: http://www.russiantortoise.org/russianto...    will she hibernate? Russian tortoises hibernate in the wild during winter when it gets too cold to digest. yes you can hibernate her, because this is what they do in the wild. but you will have to constantly measure temps, and create the ideal conditions for her to successfully hibernate. please research about this complex subject on your own.    heat rocks are dangerous just so you know, and should never be used for any kind of reptile due to their ability to give burns    how long will she live?- my guess is that she will easily live 60-100+ years with good loving care from you, her owner.  please do the research, you need to be extremely responsible in this case. good luck|`|PMksnqkxaa	Visit www.Repticzone.com it's a great site.   I don't know much about Turtles but i do know that heating rocks are TERRIBLE for any type of lizard/ turtle/ snake/ tortoise/ etc.. It will burn them because they cannot tell when it is getting too hot until it's too late and they are already burned. As soon as you get the turtle take the heat rock out and throw it in the trash. Use a light bulb instead... Like i said i don't know temperatures or what light bulb wattage so visit repticzone it's a great site.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	I believe you mean a Russian tortoise, not a Russian box turtle since there is no such thing. You have alot of research to do. Heat rocks are no good, give it a heat lamp for basking as well as a UVB light. Glass aquariums are horrible, and despite the fact they aren't the fastest animals, they still need alot of room to move, so a 20 gallon aquarium is no good. There's alot more to keeping them, so here is a good website you need to read: http://www.russiantortoise.org
Z3OTphZhaa	A metal kennel would be better because it is more sturdy.  What I find helpful is a basement which I dog proof during the puppy stage.  I will keep their food, water, a few select toys and a bed and nothing else other than newspaper for their potty needs when gone for long hours.  My basement in cement so my dogs can't destroy it.  It is also helpful because they are not confined to such a small area for long periods and have the ability to walk around.  If you have such a safe area, that may be ideal when gone for long periods.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	buy her a friend pup! :)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	She needs more exercise than shes getting. I know you dont have the time but these large breeds need alot more time to run around.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	try walking her around your local block instead of driving to the park|`|L22hVXTIaa	This dog really can't be asked to stay in a kennel all day.  That borders on cruelty.  Do you have a backyard?  Is there any way she could be out during the day?  You might at least have a friend or relative come over mid day to take her out for a walk.  Or try a doggie day care, but 10 hrs. a day in a crate for a large dog, is a very bad idea.|`|sWkcLzJtaa	keep a small, metal fenced area for her. In the area keep her crate, a water bowl, a food bowl, and a place to potty. Also put some toys in there for her.
wGrRvFePaa	Are you kidding? Go to a vet! In fact, go to an emergency 24 hour pet hospital... Why are you on here asking questions?    I don't get how people can see their animal BLEEDING with a HOLE in them, and sit on the internet typing..    Please just go!|`|ufc4JKRkaa	it sounds like he had an abcess that burst-you need to get to a vet but until you do you need to clean it out with an antiseptic solution-http://www.guinealynx.info/antiseptic_so...    do not use peroxide, neosporin or alchohol-use this, Povidone Iodine (Betadine) -- topical antiseptic microbicide. Safe to use near the eyes. Can also be diluted to a "weak tea" concentration (40 parts water to one part povidone iodine) and used to clean injuries or soak feet. Povidone iodine is less drying and also readily available at any pharmacy.   http://www.medsupplier.com/Images/produc...    If you can't find it ask someone in the store-they may have a generic brand.    Please get this pig the help it needs right away!|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	I presume the only reason you did not rush right out to a vet is that thought that you can't afford one. That is never an excuse when you are a pet owner. I have been in times when money was tight so i had a yard sale to my pet could afford the best medical care. I have raised  as much as $700 on one day by selling things that i thought i could not live with out. The truth is i never missed them and i still had my little joy who had a very expensive surgery and was happy and playing once again.   so do the right thing  get your guinea pig to a vet and pay for it by way of a yard sale if that is what it takes.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	vet, vet oh and did I mention vet? If you cannot afford a vet, go to your local pharmacy. Get some gauze. When you get home take a paper towel and wet it. Get someone to hold your pig and gently rub around and in the sore. After this wrap TIGHTLY with gauze.|`|FWlSFpByaa	Oh no! Bring him to the vet immediatly! You don't want to procrastinate on this! Go NOW|`|YWiLfZGsaa	Yes you do need to get him to a vet asap!

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Nothing is wrong with it, as long as you have a place to put them when they outgrow their tanks, which they will do pretty soon. It's people like the one who posted here recently saying he had koi along with a bunch of other fish in a 10-gallon tank who make me cringe.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Personally i don't think that's too crowded.

The problem is the people that expect koi to live in a 55gal for life. Well I guess they will, it just wont be a very long or happy life.    But as a temporary thing to grow them to a safer size for the pond, its fine.    Ian

z01moLIvaa	I put ferret toys and bird toys in my rat cages. The ones with the paper on them are the best because they love to shred it. Rope and wood toys are good too but they may not find them as interesting. Hanging a hammock up will also be a good idea. And going against what all the other people say, getting a wheel is not a bad idea. Just as long as it's big enough and made safe. The Transoniq Wodent Wheel is the best out there! Any rat fancier will recommend it to you. http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js... I suggest the 12" for rats. My rats have one and they love them! They're hyper little girls so this get their energy out and also makes them stronger. An obsessed wheel runner will get a thing called "wheel tail" or "wheelie tail" where the tail of the rat curls up and touches the back because of holding it up in that position too long while running in the wheel. It's not a bad thing and does no harm to the rat. Most people actually think it's cute. 2 of my girls have this. It doesn't stay curled all the time just every now and then, you'll see it like that.

Also, they usually like to play on a wheel, and you can also get a little cardboard box and cover it up. It's fun for them to find their own way out!|`|yZt3paskaa	my rats love paper bags keeps them busy for hours|`|ajJViUbcaa	An exercise wheel.  Theres one made especially for rats. One complete piece made of plastic, no spaces to get their tail caught anywhere and no bar to get their head caught or whacked when getting on and off the wheel. The base of the wheel is a heavy metal stand, which prevents it from falling over. The wheel can be detached from the base to attached to the bars of a cage.  The wheel is 12" wide, so theres plenty of room to run.   I think buying this wheel was the best choice I made for their cage.    They also have a hammock. I have 9 hairless dumbos and one haired dumbo who's housed with a hairless, so their hammocks are fleeced lined. Thing is, they like to make their own nest out of the fleece inside the hammock and we replace with a new one about every couple of months, because it gets so shedded and can't be washed anymore. We get the canvas like material thats fleeced lined because they last longer than just a fleece hammock.   They also enjoy using the hammock as another level to sit on and can easily jump up on to it.    We also have ropes attached to the cages, twisted tightly to form curves to walk along.    Have your tried giving dog biscuits to your rats? Not only do they like them as a treat, but it also helped trim their teeth.    And they always have an empty roll of industrial sized toilet paper to chew on. It's thick cardboard and about 3"wide so they can't get stuck in. Easy to get if you ask someone to save them for you from where they work, since most businesses used the industrial size instead of household size.    If you haven't already, with the boxes you have in there already...cut holes in the boxes big enough for them to get through, so it's kind of like a maze of different holes to go through.    Another thing they have is a large igloo. Since they sleep in the hammock mostly, the igloo is used to hide food in and to play with. They also go inside and with their head push up moving the igloo around, sometimes tipping it over. But it also gives them something to jump on. They will sleep in the igloo if they get to warm sleeping in the hammock.    Just some ideas to think about :)    Edit in: If you bought the wheel made for rats, try offering it to them again. Sometimes it takes them some time to get used to it. Once they figure it out, they'll be addicted to it.  The type we have, since female hairless rats are a smaller size, two will run side by side on the wheel. Our haired dumbo female housed with a hairless female also run on the wheel together.    We're all Trying to be helpful and giving you the best advise we can based on our experience of owning rats.     Besides, we wrote down wheels Prior to you telling us yours don't like wheels. You should have been more informative in the begining so it wouldn't be given as an idea by so many people.    Another idea! Buy them the biggest Ferret Nation cage made. Lots of room to run and climb in and has multiple levels with ramps.|`|Kka5VGyJaa	some like cat toys and bird bells and stuff|`|gs8N7Hqtaa	for starters my rat doesnt like wheels either    i have a long straw nest thing that i stuff with a mixture of treats and food and strips of kitchen paper...its simple but my guy love rooting around in it and running around with the kitchen paper then using for bedding    also anything that they can shred or chew on    try putting a shallow lid with water in and float a pingpong ball on it so your rat can mess around with the water ...it keep mine occupied for ages|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Wheels are cool. And chew toys. And little huts for them to hide in maybe. Tubes and stuff for them to climb on. :]
MGxDgsKZaa	Believe it or not, that's typical behavior for young cats when they want to play. He doesn't know he's hurting you. Check out this YouTube video; I'm sure it will look familiar!    The Mean Kitty Song  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qit3ALTel...    My advice is to squeal loudly when he bites you. This is what other kittens would do in the litter and it helps them learn what types of play will not be tolerated. Even more importantly, never reward biting with attention. He's trying to initiate play, so if you punish him by ignoring him, he'll eventually give up.    Good luck!!|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Actually, he is playing, and you are prey.  He needs to be trained that you are not prey.  When you try and shake him off, you are behaving just like a prey, so his instincts are reinforced.    You want to remove him, and strongly say NO! to him.  Perhaps shake you finger at him while you say that.  Don't hit him, as he doesn't know better.    I don't know if he is a kitten or not, so there are different approaches depending on his age.  One approach regardless of age is to give him a time out.  In other words, put him in a small dark closet for several minutes, to give him a negative response to his actions.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	You may think he's not playing, but this is common play behavior for cats.  Most kittens grow out of it, but if your kitty persists you need to retrain him.    I'll add a link from The Humane Society.    http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	maybe he has instant rage syndrome... u never know... its a real syndrome by the way|`|7589722c27f9750e98588ac43bc3b956aa	Haha my cat did that as a kitten. She does it now as an adult but usually to guest who don't know what she's up to. Like everyone has said, your kitty is only playing with you, even though it hurts. That butt wiggle means a pounce.    Put a collar with a little bell around your kitty's neck. that way you will have an audio warning.     Then you can bend over and point at your kitty and tell him/her NO very firmly. If that doesn't work get a spray bottle full of water and give them a good squirt.     Next find  a toy. the ones with spring that stand up or can stick to the wall. or a toy catnip mouse. even a ball of paper.    Running will only make it worse. You're getting bitten and you kicking could seriously hurt your cat.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	Your cat plain and simple hates you, and everything about you. If you've spent time with the cat like you should've, the cat would have no problems. Do you know of anything that you might've done to him that might cause that sort of behavior? Of course, if he's foaming, he may have rabies, or he may just be a really aggressive cat. If I were you, I'd probably either have the cat put down, or you could spend the extra cash to try and have him tutored. .... Or neutered. Either way, he'll keep attacking you until you've done something about this. It could progress into something even more serious if left untreated, and he could become extremely violent and do more than just biting.
ktVkRc3Raa	It depends on where the vest is made but if the vest is too tight they will tend to chew it but they will chew it even if it is not too tight.|`|WFzt2fHOaa	I wouldn't take the chance : /  Hamsters hate being constricted and they will probably do just about anything to get the vest off.|`|X16pbn1Daa	I dont think your hamster would appreciate a vest, besides thats what there cute fluffy fur is for, why spoil it? They dont need to wear clothes safe or not, think about your hamster being happy, its not a dress up doll!|`|zdBInQReaa	Why are you putting a vest on a hamster, they probably are toxic! Besides, hamsters are so soft anyway you don't need a vest. They hamster wont want it either!
7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	It's actually not uncommon for Siamese mixes to have vision problems.  I would have his vision checked.  Also,  some cats have difficulty seeing anything too close to their face.  Ever notice how you have to move a kibble back from their face a few inches so they can see it?   They aren't near or far-sighted per se, but their ability to perceive detail is somewhat less efficient than us.|`|qPJPjrkNaa	No he isn't stupid he maybe just doesn't want to focus on it.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	Siamese, especially ones with blue eyes, tend to be cross-eyed. It can cause vision problems and very funny faces! Just hug and love him. I have one also!
djmqoFSTaa	Being it's not full of ice...only part way right??    I would fill the rest with water on top of the ice...and put a heater in it.  Eventually the water will warm up enough to melt the ice on the bottom of the trough.  I really wouldn't fight with it...if I had enough water on top that is heated...for watering the horses.  Just an opinion...|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Boil water (as much as two - ten gallons) and carry it as hot as possible to the trough.  Carefully 'peel back' the rubber enough to make a small 'hole' between the rubber and the ice.  Pour your hot water in, while keeping the rubber away from the ice as much as possible.  If you have a friend who can help, use him/her because you'll need to have at least two of you.  When one side is basically 'free' of ice, do the same thing to the other side of the trough, then using wedges of wood, slowly 'tip' the trough until you can lift it just enough to drop that 'ice chunk' onto the ground.  Then use a trough heater and fill the trough with water for the animals.  And for next time it's winter, put at least 4-7 goldfish into each trough.  Goldfish have just enough natural body heat that only the top of the trough will freeze, so you won't have to work so hard if you need that trough in a hurry.  Don't worry if the fish don't move ... they're alive, in a sort of 'suspended animation' at the bottom of the water, but having them in that can keep the trough from totally freezing in the winter!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Tough one!  At least its not plastic- if you heated plastic trough, it would crack... hm.  Well, to un-freeze it, get a hoze of hot water, and keep pouring that.  Then, once it's unfroze, or at least slushy, take smaller buckets and keep taking it out... then, put in the water heater, and then, fill it with water!  If it doesn't work, then i suggest putting the heater in a different container/trough/watever and then you put water in.  Once the temperature rises, then, it will hopefully melt, then you empty it, and if you want, put the heater in.  EDIT:  Or... put salt on it.  gotta love that salt!|`|IVbwUy9Xaa	Do you have a warm hose? You could try running that over first, and then using a hammer to chunk the ice up. (i have done it) Depending upon how big the trough is, you can slip some gloves on and lift the pices out or tip it... -Hope it helped!    THANKIES :D|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	Can you put in more water and a heater?  If it isn't too cold,, the ice will float on the water and begin to melt. If it is very cold, say highs of twenty or less, you'll need to put a heater in to melt the ice when you've added water.  Don't fill the trough all the way.  If you can get the ice to float, you can try to get the ice out somehow.  I live in Montana, so I can sympathize.  If it is a solid chunk, the heater will be important or get another trough until Spring.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I'm with the hot water people...you might also try pouring the hot water on both the ice and the outside of the tub (flipped over), kind of the same idea as an ice cube tray loosening technique.|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	a pickax and start hacking|`|yiR22Gabaa	Bring hot water to it and just dump it on top. It'll help melt up the ice. Maybe you could try salt, too?|`|8Zmt87LOaa	I don't think there is a good way.  I'd try to find an alternate container to water them in until it was warm weather again.  That large of a container frozen will take forever to thaw out!|`|72688aae7e472777b624289e7b6159acaa	can you bang on the sides... flip it over - bang on the sides of it and get the ice to pop out like an ice cube????  you might just have to go pick up something simple until morning when you can work on it...|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	try to get a trough that flows constantly.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	I don't have experience w/ this, but just trying to help. I love animals is all. :)    This would probably be a pain in the butt, but maybe carry many buckets of hot water & keep trying to melt layers of the ice & scoop it out as it melts. Maybe try breaking some off w/ a pickaxe as you pour hot water. Add more hot & keep doing it until you can fill it up.     Or maybe just get something else to use temporarily until you can access the trough. If you can get out, maybe go buy a kiddie pool or Rubbermaid bins to fill w/ some water.|`|2xOF70S1aa	pour hot water on it and then smash it with a bucket or your boots.  since it's about 50 gallons then you will need a lot of hot water.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	I'm with B B.  Once you've got ice melting/water in it for the horses, there's no need to empty it...|`|647d90c817d50303cceb01679642cbd4aa	boil a big pot of water, dump it on the trough, then flip it over.|`|hwydxZnZaa	Get some steaming hot water and pour it over the ice and then get a hammer and start pounding away on the ice... its alot of work but it will get the job done... ive had to do it a few times|`|BIshtm7oaa	Lots of salt will help it melt. This is tedious but try taking a hair drier/personal heater thingy and holding it next to the frozen water. It might take a while but it will work.    The more important thing is, how do you keep it unfrozen after you've unfrozen it?|`|zfz4Toblaa	You should try putting a lot of salt on the ice, then you get anything that will reach the ice that is HOT(blow dry the ice with a blow dryer, steaming hot water). After the ice softens hammer away with a hammer. You will need to do this process many times before you get the ice out. Just add A LOT of salt and a lot of warmth and hammer away!
9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	yes, benadryl can be given to dogs,  the vet i worked for told owners they could give to puppies that got vaccines (among other things).  Benadryl is not used for parasites.  I would contact your vet and let them know she vomited when you dewormed her.  she may need to be dose again|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Your puppy is puking up worms.  you may want a follow-up with your vet.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	I used to give my dog Benadryl for his allergies.  This is what my vet told me to use as well and he did just fine with it.  Make sure you are following the dosage guidelines set by your vet.  I hope your puppy starts feeling better soon.|`|5PsKGss7aa	Call your vet for a confirmation of dosage.|`|OXNj34gzaa	Please DO NOT PLAY VET.   "...said something about give it some kids benadryl but idk..." is not being sure.  Ask your vet again and MAKE SURE you can actually give that to your puppy.    One wrong move can put your puppy's life in danger.      Please be a responsible owner.|`|IQjO3Weoaa	I highly doubt a trained vet would tell you that. That's a really stupid thing to do. People's insides are very different to dog's insides.|`|sJSEcuToaa	Call the vet...|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	I'm curious why the doctor suggest benadryl.  What was it recommended for?  At the vet clinic I work at, we do suggest benadryl to clients for allergies and in some cases as a mild sedative.  Be sure to consult your vet for the correct dosage, especially in the case of a puppy.|`|VeVHY7OOaa	Yes you can give benadryl to dogs, BUT you need to call your vet & find out how much she wants her to have.  Dogs metabolize differently than people, so you can't follow a human-dosage instruction.  I'm not sure on giving a dog benadryl if you're trying to get rid of worms... doesn't make sense to me to give something to your dog that has central nervous system affects (making the dog sleepy) if you're trying to get the dog to expel the worms though.  Don't give it unless you talk to your vet again!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Only with your vet permission & the dosage she would suggest.  Since she is on other meds, it might affect the outcome.  It won't help with nausea either.
XwHtuIvnaa	Since there isn't much that you can do after the chicken bones have been ingested by your dog, you simply need to monitor him closely for the next few days.    Keep checking his stools to see if the bones pass. Watch for blood in the stool, or any signs that he's straining to defecate.    You should also keep an eye on your dog's temperament. If he becomes moody or listless, take him to a vet immediately.    Perhaps the best thing you can do is try to "cushion" the tiny bones inside your dog's tummy by overfeeding him a little more over the next couple of days. Cooked rice (that's completely cooled first) is ideal, because it is gentle on a dog's stomach and digestive tract. You could serve up a small helping of plain white rice alone, or mix some cooked rice in with your dog's normal dog food.    Then, you just wait and see.    Chances are, everything will come out fine in the end.|`|bZhIEy1Waa	Please don't give him anymore peroxide - i don't for the life of me know why this is the given should a dog be in trouble - have you seen what this acid does to hair? It does the same to a dogs intestines and will make any nausea ten times worse!!! He'll be fine with a wing, there are many soft bones in it and the stomach acids alone will deal with any hard bones that won't pass through. There are only two 'major' bones in a chicken wing but these are quite small and if your dog is of the large size he'll have no trouble. If he's on the small side just keep your eye on him, if he retches or refuses his food in the next 6 hours then take him to your vet but he'll probably escape unharmed, they usually do!!! Little sod's for swallowing thing's they shouldn't and it's only rarely that it causes big trouble. Stop worrying so much, he'll pick up on your unease and it'll make him worry - the things we do so they have a comfortable life ha ha. Best of luck.|`|sKvIgiN4aa	give him a spoon to swallow   next

Give her the treat every time.  2. Use a Post-it. Put in on your hand, and make her touch it.  3. Move the Post-it, on the wall, get her to touch it there.  4. Put it on the light switch. Get her used to touching it there.  5. When she is used to touching the light, remove the Post-it, and get her to touch the light.

Always praise afterwards, and give a treat about evry so other time (as not to upset thier stumach) For their stumach plain dog food is best, but wont really  work if their not a little hungry.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I always like the one where you put a treat or biscuit on his nose then get him to toss it in the air and catch it, but I don't know that that is unique.|`|yacLHWqEaa	ok lets say u want a dog to sit u could either sit yur self and then tell yur dog to do it u Have! to show yur dog wat to do then u  can treat it if it does it right|`|9hSSocD0aa	Teach your dog how to talk.  like my aunt has two great danes  and i have a pit bull. and when my  aunt tells her dog to speak  he stars like howling. hes kinda   sounds like hes saying something.  -XD|`|MJnF0pfFaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uraY7pmUS...|`|4Jsi62esaa	Be creative.

It's really simple and fun to show off to your friends!  Just get your dog to sit and get treats ready.  Softly, push her down (so that she is at a dead position) and say the word you want to accommodate with this trick.  For my dog, I use the word: BANG!  Use a short word so that it is easy to remember.  Now, after saying that word, give your dog a treat.  Make sure she is back up after wards, and just do that process over and over.  It took my dog about 20 minutes to remember it.  So, depending on your dog, it should work if you have patience and perseverance.  Remember, don't give too much treats (your dog will get sick after wards).  For fun, you can also associate a hand symbol with the trick, like holding your hand like a gun.  Hope this helps, and good luck!
4BBjhHAnaa	You can get a rabbit for a lot cheaper than that!!!  Go to a breeder and get one of the pet quality baby buns.  I was going to get one for $20, but then two of the bunnies in that litter ended up with gimp legs so I got him for FREE.      (BTW- the gimp leg doesn't hurt the bunny or make it hard for him to get around.  What happened is he drank too much milk while he was nursing and got too heavy for his leg to support, so now it is slightly turned out)    Also, it is cheaper to build a cage than to buy one.  A bunny likes too have a lot of room, your $80 cage may be just big enough, but it probably isn't very good quality.    I built a sturdy 2'x3'x2' cage for less than $50.  If you want, I could give you the design.  Email me tess.sabo@yahoo.com      As for how to raise the money . . . do some extra chores, shovel your neighbors' driveways.

I'm sorry to say but if you can not cover the adoption fee alone without "saving up" it's very likely you do not have enough money to adequately care for this animal. Getting the cage and the animal itself is usually the cheapest part in the long run.  Save up any money you get for now, and wait till you're old enough to get a job and to pay for an animal's care.

I suggest you find a stable and help with the horses first to make sure you really want a horse and understand that they are hard work (but very well worth it if it's what you like)|`|5M57TTfpaa	i just bought mine for 500, she is perfect. just make sure you have the money to take care of her monthly, not just the money to buy her!|`|AA10356572	depends where you buy from and what country you are in..  how well trained the horse is.. how old.. etc..    read this link    http://www.bukisa.com/articles/17091_how...  how to buy a horse    DO NOT spend all your money on the horse - keep some for emergency and supplies..    most areas have regular auctions but these are risky..|`|wYBU1B1qaa	Thanks go the economy, there are plenty of wonderful free horses out there.  People just can't afford them anymore and would love to place them in a good home.  Just be sure you are fully prepared to care for this animal that can be VERY expensive and requires a lot of time.  If you haven't already, please do your research.  Getting and caring for a horse isn't as easy as it sounds!  Good luck!|`|hwydxZnZaa	it depends... you can always go to a local auction and bid for a horse that way you get what you want for how much you have... but make sure you look the horses over before you bid on one.|`|vylUVn48aa	Horses can cost anywhere from free to thousands of dollars. I bought mine for $1300. However, the first cost is nothing compared to the rest of the costs, like the vet, farrier, boarding, and feed. The farrier costs from $30-$100 every 2 months, depending on whether you shoe your horse. The vet bill depends, however, a service call for me costs $40. Boarding, probably the most expensive, cost $395 a month for me, although that is an extremely expensive stable. We are moving my horse to a stable that is $270 a month. As you can see, horses are quite expensive. You would defiantely find a horse for $600, but it might not suit your needs. I would suggest looking on websites, like craigslist, or going to different stables to see if anything is for sale.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	Do you even know anything about horses?|`|IWV6fnnJaa	Depending on the bread, as well as the ethical background like if the steed has any champion blood in him or her. But to maintain a horse... well that is a different story|`|KqjVgJdSaa	Depends... it depends on breed, age, the amount of training the horse has, experience, and blood lines. But if u only have 600 dollars 4 the horse, and it will be really hard 2 find a horse 4 that low of a price. Plus the actually upkeep of the horse costs way more than the actual horse. And i just need 2 say if ur not experienced don't get a horse ive seen it 2 many times go bad. =)|`|2xOF70S1aa	it depends you can get a horse at an auction pretty cheap sometimes.  if this is your first horse though don't go to an auction.  both my friend and my cousin got horses from an auction and they were drugged before the auction and turned out to be bad horses for a first time rider (which i assume you are).   i bought my horse from some people in a nearby town.  she cost $1,200 but she is a very good horse except when she has her days. i suggest a gelding.   but take your time, it took me about a year to find a good horse.  go and ride the horse you are interested in buying and make sure you feel comfortable riding it and you trust your horse to take care of you.|`|HX5MdJVSaa	I ride english, hunter jumpers and i have been riding for about 7 years and I show successfully on the winter circuit and i would say around 5-7,000 for a decent horse but you have to think about the feed, farrier, vets bills, equipment (saddle,bridle,saddle pad, grooming kit, fencing,barn ect.) but, you can find a lower level horse for around 1000-2500. it is not a cheap sport, but it can be very rewarding and that is what really matters :)|`|c246ac86dcaacf7f923baa2e96250f43aa	It isn't really how much the horse is. Horses cost a lot of money. You have to buy hay (or make it) have a place fot it to stay. shoes (if needed) this all adds up i know i have to pay for most of the things for my horse. My horse cost 1,200.00 that is for a trail horse that i have taught to run barrels and poles. and a few other things. Um if you want a good horse it might cost around 1,000 maybe not. the economy is down really bad right now so you might get to buy a good horse for less than 1,000. just depends. Hope i helped and hope you find what you are looking for = ) Good Luck!!|`|5ceX1Plyaa	yer u can find grat horses on this website! like ones u just wanna ride and stuff not really for show for 600 dollars! u can also get hose equiptment and products from here as well      www.horsedeals.com    just click search at the top right     u can choose the age, gender, minimum and top price hight breed state if u dont live in australia or newzealand , under state there is one called other countries click on that    good luck! i hope that helped    :P   :O   :)   :D|`|TB7q2moCaa	You will not be able to get a good dependable horse for that much. most of the time good horses are at least 1,100. They are to expensive to give away for nothing.|`|GJR8HJjHaa	My first horse was free and he has a lot of training issues (but I love him so he's been a pasture puff for years)  My second horse was $5,000 great bloodlines, 100% sound and competitive at shows right away.  Horse number 3 cost me $20 is well trained but had soundness issues that I have spent about a thousand resolving (and they are now 100% resolved)     So what I mean by this is you CAN get a horse for free/cheap but often their is a good reason for the price. I suggest saving more money for the initial price, a vet check, and as much as possible for emergency's.    Also I can not stress how important having good quality lessons both riding and horsemanship before buying a horse is.
u61yKsE3aa	yes turtles shed as they grow.  If your turtle is still being kept warm and eating then it will still grow and will shed accordingly.  YOu have nothing to worry about|`|jEA6z3jlaa	yeahh its normal i own two turtles both RES, and as they grow they do shed and i noticed alot more often in the winter hahah, but as long as your not feeding them wayy to much its good have fun wit htheir turtles
rMTq7yMyaa	A teddy bear hamster doesn't exist. Its a fake name given to hamsters in pet stores to attract customers.    Its actually called a syrian.    Male syrian. Females tend to be more aggresive.     For more information go to www.hamsterhideout.com/forum|`|LGDpt4jUaa	I think syrians are the nicest, Males are better they are more calm.|`|zdBInQReaa	I don't suggest Syrian/ teddy bear, they are mean to me normally, no idea why. I suggest a Dwarf hamster, though I have read online that they are vicious! Not my hamsters though!|`|krqfJViEaa	Well the breed doesnt matter. It just matters what your hamster's personality is and if it will accept you. If you want to make sure that your hamster is nice, ask the workers their if you can hold them. Pick the one that is not jittery and doesnt bite. (Although if you hold a robo their always jittery so its normal as they are the fastest breed of hamsters.) But if you are a first-time hamster owner a recommended types is a syrian (teddy bear, panda bear, black bear, normal, average) hamster because they are the largest and slower breed. It is SAID that males are more calm and less jittery than females. But like again it just depends on the hamster. So feel free to choose a male or female as you like.    Enjoy hamster picking! :)|`|WFzt2fHOaa	I've had 8 syrian(teddy bear) hamsters and never been bitten (4 boys, 4 girls) The boys were more tame(knew their names and some tricks), and liked to cuddle :)    I had 1 dwarf hamster and was bitten 3 times by him (mainly when I was feeding him)|`|mTJ8wTs3aa	Syrians are great if you're planning on handling the hamster a lot. When choosing a hamster based on the animal. Hamsters react to people based upon their individual personalities, not their gender. It is true that females do have a VERY slight tendency to be more aggressive, but it comes as a trade-off because they also tend to be more active and interactive. Males have a VERY slight tendency to be more sluggish and lethargic than females, but these are extremely generalized rules and the average person wouldn't even be likely to notice the difference. Good luck with your hamster!|`|EHqhirz8aa	Females are more aggressive. I would suggest getting a male. But, if your male isn't tame, it will take longer to tame than females. I hoped this helped! :)|`|X16pbn1Daa	Hamsters male or female can be grumpy and tend to bite alot (not saying this about all hamsters) but in general. Although males would be the bet, have you considered gerbils? As they are usually naturaly friendly if you want a nice pet :)|`|xTpXhLkSaa	That is easy a syrian hamster. They come in different colors and different names like panda hamsters they are still syrians and they live up to 2 or 3 years.Syrian hamsters are good 4 kids ages 3 and up they r very lovely =) hope i helped.And females r nicer.
3sB49YNnaa	I would get them off of alfalfa hay and on to a good grass hay now.  We use grass hay (Coastal Bermuda) from the time they are born and throughout their life.  Alfalfa has a lot of calcium and could be contributing to the "sludge", especially if you are also feeding an alfalfa based pellet, which we recommend unless you are having weight or sludge problems.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I don't see why you should stop feeding them alfalfa hay.  I've also read recently on the internet that cranberry juice (diluted) will help if they have a UTI.  My daughter's guinea pig's cage smells awful after just 2 days of fresh bedding, so, I'm going to give it a try.  Hope it helps yours too, if you choose to try it, of course!|`|FWlSFpByaa	No alfalfa is sooooooo good for your guniea pig. it should be used more for a treat not a daily feeding. It sounds like a urinary tract infection best to bring them to the vet and get antibiotics|`|XuYeLCXaaa	Alfalfa is really good for the little guy... Keep feeding it to the guy!. If he seems to not like it, only give it once in a while.|`|9JKigzKWaa	you do not want to stop feedin him  it  it's one of the best things ur lil piggy can hav  besides carrots:]
iiNAJfGCaa	Last December I graduated from Delaware Valley College with my Bachelor's Degree in Animal Science with an emphasis on Equine Studies. I am currently a barn manager at a highly reputable boarding/training facility in Pennsylvania. Some of my fellow graduates now have the following jobs: assistant manager at Dover Saddlery in New Jersey, sales representative for Merck Animal Pharmaceuticals, feed consultant for Purina, head trainer for a lesson barn in Maryland, and a veterinary assistant at a large animal vet office in Pennsylvania.     A degree in equine studies will give you a big leg up in "business" type jobs as well as give you something to fall back on. If you are seriously thinking of pursuing a degree in Equine Studies I would also recommend taking a minor in business.|`|AA10986942	It will get you nothing but you will probably have fun getting there!  My niece wasted her parents money getting a degree in equine studies... so you can get hired in a barn... big deal anyone with experience can get that job and they didnt have to pay $70,000 for it!|`|EW4zX8lnaa	Unfortunately, it is a pretty useless thing to major in--I would do a minor if I were you. There isn't much you can do so it is good to have a different major that you can rely on when it comes time to get a job--then if you have some great opportunity to get a horse related ob then you still have your ES minor! If you plan on doing Animal Science then i hope you are doing AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics while in high school. You could be a breeder, trainer, have your own farm and teach lessons, start a therapeutic riding center, vet, farrier, and not much else. As for animal science again you could be a breeder, you could research genetics and stuff, work for food processing companies. If I were you, I would do a Business or Economics major with a minor in Equine Studies. Then you have the ability to do any of the animal science stuff (for horses only) and the skills to manage a farm or any other horse related business AND so many other career options having to do with business that i can't even list because it is such a useful degree. Job markets are competitive so it is important to make sure you study something you love, but also something practical.    This is about Animal Science major  http://www.asas.org/career.htm|`|hwydxZnZaa	Go to the College of Northwest website and ask them to send you a packet... I am wanting to do the same thing. They have a lot of different things that you can get a job in. Check it out and hope they have something you would enjoy.. Good luck

fd4a3ae51fa692f02b61eba26cc79c77aa	Squirt bottle, water, FRESH squeezed, strong lemon juice. Refrig lemon H20 so very cold and unpleasant. The mixture becomes stronger overnight and your dog will hate it. Allow dog to bark initial one or two warning barks, which is fine. Anything more, forcefully and directly squirt your dog very close up in the face/nose with a firm verbal "tshh!" and warning look. Then turn away and ignore dog. Repeat if dog does again. Be consistent and do this immediately the moment your dog does unwanted action. Do not threaten dog with bottle, intimidation is useless and unfair.The correction with water bottle and verbal "tshh" must be consistent and done the instant your dog barks excessively so he mentally connects the barking with the unpleasant squirt and understands what you want. Do not praise him when he shuts up, simply turn and walk away after the squirt. Praising him when he shuts up will only confuse him. A loud clap after the initial bark might work as it does with my shep sometimes, but Bassetts are very vocal and stubborn and I doubt it would have any effect on your dog. The fresh icy cold squirt of lemon water directly in the face should work. Also, you need to take Sarge for a brisk moderately long walk 2-3 times EVERY day. It is likely he is not getting nearly enough exercise. Walking also helps you establish the leadership role. I walk my German Shep 3 times every day rain or shine, because she needs it. It is your duty to your dog to make sure your dog is exercised adequately. Neuter him if he is not may help calm him a little as well. And spend time every day teaching your dog, training him, with positive reinforcement, so that you increase your bond, and your dog learns the value and good feelings of a job well done and pleasing you. When you arrive home, ignore Sarge..do not touch him or speak or look at him. After a few minutes, when he has calmed down and is sitting, then you may turn to him and pet him. Giving attention to misbehavior will only reinforce it. Your goal is to communicate to Sarge what you do expect from him, and how to please you, not simply focusing on negative behaviors. he needs to understand what you are asking of him. He is not stupid, you simply need to improve your communication with him, work with him more often,. Also read more about canine behavior via web and books. Many things dogs do seem foolish to us if we do not understand them.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I grew up in a neighborhood where there were two families with Bassets who were "yard dogs."  After hearing the noise those things made (which sounds similar to what you say about Sarge) I didn't want a basset hound - ever.  My son sweet talked me into getting one.  My basset has lived inside since day one.  He talks when he has something to say (like feed me, pet me, take me for a walk), but other than that he's nothing like the basset neighbors I had.    It sounds like Sarge lives outdoors and the main issue is that Sarge keeps your dad from sleeping during the day by making "basset noise."    Your family may not believe in letting dogs live indoors, but bassets are meant to be indoor family dogs.  That basset is making noise because he's lonely.  He isn't getting to be with his pack (you and your family).  Bring that hound inside and let him live in the house and 75-90% of the noise you're complaining about will go away.    Good Luck!|`|85aWKsptaa	dog whisperer|`|lL7WnZlHaa	I would recommend getting a barking collar.

Cats with liver problems can have the iris of the eye change from the normal color to a yellow-orange color.  Also other part can turn yellow.  Do the whites of her eyes, the inside or her ears, her gums, foot pads or skin (check by parting the hair) look yellow.  She really needs a vet.  Liver disease can cause weight loss and nasea.  Nasea can be manifested by drooling.  Mouth problems (infection, tumor, rotten or broken tooth)-could cause weight loss if she she was too painful to eat and the drooling could be from the irritation.  Kidney disease could also cause weight loss and drooling (again due to nasea)--Again however, the color change in the eyes would make me nervous about the liver.  And cats that get sick for any reason and stop eating can develop a condition called hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver).|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	WHY is she eating human food?  WHERE is she getting it?  From the garbage, off the table, being fed TO her, etc??????    Human food is probably the cause of the drooling and weight loss.  So many people cook with garlic, onions, etc and both of these things are TOXIC to cats.    It's waaaaaay PAST time for you to take her to the vet.  Unless, you plan to just let her die?  Is that it?   Contagious or not, your cat is SICK......She needs to be seen by a VET.....ASAP.    Hopefully, the vet will discover what her problem is, and it can be treated.  Waiting for 3 months, you may have waited TOO long for the vet to be ABLE to help.    Hope she gets the attention that she DESERVES......SOON.

iU2fQBtRaa	Well, there are a lot of breeds. I would look into a Border Collie crossed with a Lab. We have a part Black Lab part Border Collie, and Lou is the most dependable, loyal, obedient (once he was trained a bit) and loving dog I've ever known. We know other people who have had a collie with a lab dog and they say the same thing. You should get one with a good personality though, and one that you can take care of and will pay attention.     Lou is a big dog, bu if you want a smaller dog, try looking at toy dogs or something like that.     Virtually all small dog breeds make good little watchdogs--they will all make some sort of commotion (growling or barking)--when a stranger enters their turf. But some breeds are better at this job than others. A few are highly alert and will bark unrelentingly if a stranger is on "their" property. Big dogs are very good watchdogs as well, and they can let you know easily. I find that smaller dogs seem to stay a baby almost, while big dogs are like big loyal teddy bears (some of them:). Still, I would recommend a good big dog. You might not need a dog for a watchdog. You might just want some company. The good thing about  border collie/lab, (and some other dogs) is that they are both those and much more. They are good watchdogs, lovable, and loyal.     They love tennis balls by the way :)|`|1lP9ALI1aa	it depends on wat kind of dog u lik nad wat kind of person u r    if u lik running, mayb a grayhound    so it depends|`|vKhvsb2iaa	Family Dog - Golden Retriever    Guard/Family - Rottweiler/German Shepherd    Herding - Australian Cattle Dog/Anatolian Shepherd    Big Dog - St Bernard/Mastiff        I prefure big dogs as you can see.|`|RIOPLOq7aa	Try researching dogs on the internet and see something you like, research it.|`|QUn9900oaa	There is not a "Best Breed of Dog".

rrFbQZzIaa	i have no clue what this other person is even talking about. A Juvi? Juvenile refers to the age of the dragon, it's not a color morph that I'm at all aware of. And it is not possible to breed your dragon to a albino b/c I'm not even aware of albino dragons being around and if they were, they would be extremely rare. From what I've heard, albino dragons have not survived past a few months b/c of their sensitivity to UV light. So if your dragon is just a plain old boring male, he's not going to be a money making breeder. What you would be better off doing is purchasing two baby or juvi's that are of a certain morph. Go to www.kingsnake.com. There you can browse through tons of dragons for sale and you will get an idea of how much different morphs go for. Dragons typically don't sell for much unless you have a very good looking ones. If your male does not have any good recessive genes, you will probably not end up w/ much of value in your clutches.   PS: Even If albino dragons were around, if you bred your male w/ them, you would not get albinos, as both the mother and father need to carry the Amelanistic gene to create a albino. 3 yrs is a little extreme, 18 months is a fine age to breed a bearded dragon.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	Do NOT breed juveniles. A bearded dragon, male or female, should be at least 3 years old to mate so there is no worry about health problems and to insure the sex.    Visit beardeddragon.org for more information on breeding.|`|MaXJs4zbaa	Yes it possible.    Try it with a juvenile.    Juv's are cool looking
rrFbQZzIaa	no erik, you do not want to do this for one. Two you will not be successful in your outcome. In other post someone had asked about breeding morphs and you said to get a juvi b/c they're cool. Juvenile dragons is in reference to their age, not to their color. Also they are not sexually mature as dragons typically reach sexual maturity at 1 to 2 yrs of age and by this time, they would not be a juvenile. Now If you did get a female, you do not want to breed her until she is about 18 months, meaning she has to be a adult. If you breed a female when she is not ready or too young, she will almost certainly have health problems and may not survive for more than a few months to a few years. Also your clutches that do come out will most likely be duds.   Pet stores will not give you much for bearded dragons. They may give you $10-$25 a baby and that doesn't mean that they will buy every one that you have. If you have a certain dragon morph, they may sell for more. Morphs would be sandfire, translucent, etc and they will garner more money from a store or buyer. If you breed, you have to be aware that if you cannot find a buyer, which happens a lot, you will be stuck w/ 20 bearded dragons who you will have to feed, clean and house. Feeding 20 bearded dragons for a week alone will probably cost $20 at the least and that's just feeding. Pet stores will want your dragons to be well established so you will have to raise them for atleast 2 to 4 weeks. As you see, it's a lot of work and not really a money maker unless you have the right kinds of bearded dragons. So again, you need to wait to breed your bearded dragon  add: 3 yrs to wait is overkill, you can breed after 18 months, that's fine. And to say you cannot guarantee the sex of two dragons until 18 months is one of the most obsurd things I've ever heard in my life. I can sex most of my dragons successfully a week after hatching and by 8-12 months the sex is extremely obvious. I've never had a dragon that I've sexed after 2 months and had it change sexes on me. It's probably b/c the other person works at petco. Possibly one of the worst stores.|`|1c3d47cb23a5e186ce3ede1c1b323befaa	No, DO NOT breed juvenile bearded dragons. you have to wait until they are old enough to breed!!!!!!!!      I hope this helps!|`|shQDvqUDaa	No, only breed beardies when they are ready. Pet stores wont buy the babies.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	It is actually best to wait until both are about 3yrs old. If you start them too early, even if adults, they can get "burnt out".    Pet stores do not buy bearded dragons from individuals who decide to just breed, they usually buy from a major breeding company like sand-fire.     There are too many risks that can come from trying to breed them too young, including the fact that you cannot 100% tell what they are - male or female until they are at least about a year and a half, and sometimes this is still not the right time.     No matter what the sex, you should not house beardies together. They do become territorial and don't like sharing their space. You need at least a 40g for each dragon.
Yu7y6yfraa	First, clean the crate.  Put 1 part Bleach and 9 parts water in a mixture.  Wipe or spray the crate down with this solution.  Let it sit for 10 minuets and then wipe it off with a damp cloth or rinse it off in a tub.    If you dog is small, go for a sink bath.  If your dog is large, go for the tub.  Wash him well with dog shampoo or a mild shampoo.  Dry him very good with a towel and keep him warm until he dries.    Good luck.    I have Min Pins.  With their short hair, I often just wipe them down with a wet cloth.|`|ssiqDLKsaa	just do noramal bathing routines and towel dry him and keep him warm like you would do to yourself butt DO NOT put him outside while he is wet he could get sick    clean the create with a mixture of water and bleach then wash in plain water after scrubbed|`|veRfGJopaa	I personal would ask for advise from a groomer in your area.   I take my cages to a car wash and blast them even if it is cold outside.  I would wash the dog first ..and do not use the cage until you have clean it.  I groom dogs and I use reg Dawn dish soap for cleaning cages leashes etc..   I also use a spray bottle of vinegar and water for accidents in my shop ...so far so good|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Disinfect the cage with bleach and hot water, then rinse it with vinegar and water to kill all traces of any urine smell. Give your dog a bath with dog shampoo if you have it, if not you can use vinegar and water as well, it will clean his coat and also take the urine smell away. Make sure you dry him very well and don't let him outside until he is fully dry.

I doubt 1 Hershey's kiss will kill him but I wouldn't start that as a treat. They are pet "chocolate" treats you can buy.  Good luck.|`|AA11334070	chocolate is poison for dogs, you obviously wouldn't give poison to a human so why give it to an animal.|`|0DxgW7pmaa	No !! even a small amount of choclate can kill a dog even a large one .dont do it!!|`|DK6kYxmGaa	No, it's not OK to give dogs chocolate because it can kill them.    My 11 year old dog (25 pounds chow/shih-tzu mix) ate two HUGE chocolate peanut butter rabbits at Easter time (a couple of weeks apart) when she was around 4 years old, and had NO negative side effects. We didn't even have to take her to the vet---although she chewed through the box and eat the foil wrapper with it. She is one of the RARE dogs that doesn't get effected by chocolate.     Therefore chocolate effects individual dogs differently, but most dogs could very possibly die from it if not immediately taken to the vet.|`|xGvHxTFSaa	no chocolate is horrible for dogs. it is poisonous for them. so are grapes.
b3cfbbeb3bbfc593977384764590fdfeaa	Please take her to an emergency vet if she appears to be in pain for an unexplained reason. Unlike humans, dogs cannot simply say, "hey, this hurts!" if they are in pain.     Her whimpering and crying is a sign that something is not right and it is hurting her. Could be external, could be internal. It also depends on how she is acting otherwise, such as her appetite, energy level, ect.     If she is acting perfectly normal, with absolutely no other symptoms, then it may be okay to wait until morning to get her to a vet.

l9RDuthbaa	You need to ask for a special permit in order to own a monkey (or any  other wild animal).  Wild animals must be kept in a cage the there are directions you must follow to keep them.  You can ask for more details at from the person in charge of wild-animals in captivity: Eti.sabag@npa.org.il|`|RWeYKj0qaa	Have you researched how to take care of a Monkey?  Didn't think so.  Leave them where they belong.|`|TAvSupLnaa	dude, dont get a monkey they SOUND cool
ajJViUbcaa	They need to get used to you first.  Open their cage door and hand them treats. When they can come to your hand without totally reaching their nose out to get a treat, start putting your hand up under them slowly while your hand is in the cage, but allow them to jump off if they want.  Soon they should be tolerant of your hand and might hop on your hand themselves.    Females are skiddish and more active than males by nature. Their the providers for the nest. Males only have one role in life, makes the females pregnant, so theres no reason to be as active.|`|b6IJgvNIaa	Like a lot of animals, mice get used to you by storing your scent in their minds. They smell you a few times, and establish if you are a threat, or a friend. What you should do is put your hand in the cage with a treat (use either a treat made for rodents or a piece of broccoli or something) at the tip of your fingertips. They should (eventually, mice require A LOT of patience) crawl up and take the treat. Do this maybe twice a day for a week and they should calm down. From what you told me, it sounds like they are just a bit scared so they are jumpy. Once they are used to your smell as a friendly smell that gives them yummy food, you can move on to the next step :-) Start to move the treat to where your hand meets your wrist. After the same process, they should crawl up and get the treat. Once they are crawling a bit of a way up your wrist to get the treat, you are in good shape. Remember, this may take a few weeks. When they are quite calm, you may hold them very close to the ground. If you are not comfortable because you are scared they will jump out, (I know this sounds strange, but it really works) you can sit in the bathtub with them and thehy will run around but they can't run away. Always remember to be gentle with your little girls!! Good Luck! x  Abby
5PsKGss7aa	First off, you shouldn't give a dog a bath 2-3 times a week, that's a bit too much..It will dry him out.  You should tell the vet that he still is itchy,or if that vet isnt helping much, then get another.|`|50azgKE8aa	It's very possible it's an anxiety disorder.  If that's the case then he doesn't feel that there's a solid, strong leader in the house.  You see dogs are pack oriented animals and must have an alpha/ leader.  If they don't they become a nervous reck and sometimes even become aggressive.  My advice would be to do some research on cesar millan.  He's a "dog trainer".  And a very good one at that!|`|sQOXjKFNaa	stop washing your pups dry skin!  Allergies can cause the scatching or just dry skin.  Hyrocortozone may help. if that doesnt work call your vet and mention predizone.|`|AA10356572	okay.. dont treat the symptoms - find out what the problem is// sometimes its food related..  read this link     http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/What-is-in-...  even if the dog is on a food the vet suggested check into it becuase if the vet sells the food - of course they will suggest it...|`|5cYgk9FSaa	it could be allergies on his feet, like after we take my dog for a walk, she chews on her feet, so I'd avoid stuff like that, so he wouldn't scratch or chew so much.|`|veRfGJopaa	I am not sure what you mean by his smell.  A groomer in your area may be able to help you and your pet   Until then try this..  Give him a bath in apple cider vinegar and water mixture 1part vinegar to 5 part water (there is no wrong way to mix this)..do not get in his face and eyes.  let your dog sit with this mixture on him for about 3 min  than suds him up in a all natural shampoo..than rinse well  See if this helps him..  Good luck|`|w6LwvPKUaa	Allergies. Prendizone can be prescribed for short period. He may also need an antibiotic for the irritated skin. Have the anal glands been checked? That can cause him to bite at his backside. Benadryl does nothing to help the itch, it just makes the dog too tired to scratch.
wjwsFPMuaa	You will need to take her to the vet to make sure. Most dogs will throw more than one puppy. It's possible the others have died inside her and she's not pushing them out. If that's the case then they need to be removed ASAP or they can kill her.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Yes its possible for her to have had only 1 puppy. To be on the safe side you should take her to the vet to get her checked out.|`|IQjO3Weoaa	Ask your breeding mentor. :)    Or better yet, ring your vet! Surely s/he would be able to tell, since you obviously had an ultrasound a few weeks ago like any responsible breeder would.|`|KxjUim7yaa	After the puppy comes the afterbirth. You should have gotten an x-ray so you know how many were in there. You better take her to the vet to make sure there aren't any dead puppies in there.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	The only way to know is to take her to your vet and have her xrayed to see if she still has any puppies inside.  If she does, this is a life or death situation.

UoYchRxraa	No back pad in the world will fix a back problem. It may help relief pressure but the pain and the issue will still be there for your horse. Like it or not you are going to have to get a chiropractor. You shouldn't attempt to fix his back either, by pulling on his tail of anything. This could make the problem worse. Pulling the tail would also only help the spine, if done correctly. A good chiropractor with work your horse's whole body. It is not just the spine that will need re-aligned the muscles holding the spine in place will need loosened so they don't pull the spine out of place again. Also since your horse is sore in the wither that spot will need worked on as well. Spend the money, make your horse more comfortable. You will both appreciate it. But don't attempt chiropractic work yourself, you could end up seriously or even permanently injuring your horse.|`|hEXb1unraa	No saddle pad in the world is gonna correct an existing back pain issue, you first need to get the problem resolved first then an ortho pad may prevent or help it from reoccurring.|`|hwydxZnZaa	i had a friend who's horse started doing this too him...and he didn't spend money on things like new tack and chiropractors and such but he did ask one a question about what he could do and the lady told him how to put his horse's back back into place which is simple to do.... While standing behind your horse take his tail...Make sure he is standing straight and slightly pull... it will re align his spine and he will probably feel alot better... it might take awhile but only give it a slight pull until he gets used to it.. it sounds mean but its not i do it to my barrel and my roping horses all the time and they've gotten to the point they lift their tails for me to do this even when i'm not trying to lol but try this i hope it works for you like it has me|`|JX0I6x1paa	Definitely consult a chiropractor.  Don't try to treat it yourself.  Any back injury should be treated by a professional as soon as possible.

gwDftPBsaa	EasyBalance is crap and a waste of money. All you need is a water conditioner like Prime or AquaSafe. It seems like your tank isnt even cycled which explains why your fish has ick. Doing a water chaing is a good idea since your ammonia and nitrite levels are high. But just doing a water change will not get rid of the ick. What kind of filteration are you using right now? I would use the medicine that your dad already bought(just make sure it treats for ick) but dont take out the filters. You should however continue doing more water changes in that tank since you didnt cycle it.  Feel free to ask me more questions if there is something you dont get.|`|sZKRnYm8aa	how big is the tank|`|bVaUkTJ3aa	obviously thats not gonna be enough just applying the medecine.  water changes are nessescary for treating any disease. lucky ich is e-z to cure just  raise your temperate by 2-4 degree's  change about 50 percent of the water  i would remove the filter if it is cycled and put it in another tank or youll have to cycle again after its cured.  than just do daily 10% water changes and vacumm from the bottom as that is where the ich lay for 24 hours to breed into more add slime coat+ to help him deal with it a little and feed him his favorite foods

Now that he's in his 55, he has places to hide and only comes out after lights out.|`|gwDftPBsaa	Yes thats ok, hes just comfortable with his enviorment. Nothing to worry about.

3n60UxgQaa	Contrary to the popular belief, a fish's memory, including goldfish's does not suck.  This is easily proven by the fact that most fish will go to the top when they see their food provider.     Every time I near the fish tank, my fish will go to the top expecting food. This is because they associate me with food. Had they only had a three second or so memory, they would have been unable to make this connection. =]  Furthermore, my blood parrot cichlids will dance around when I'm near the tank. However, when my younger brother comes into view, they will hide. This is probably due to the fact that they do not recognize my brother. So I believe that they can even memorize faces. =]|`|yV8fog7Paa	They have the memory of about 3 seconds. I've wondered that too, my ...uhh, ...6 goldfish (the big ones) do the same thing.

It's a reasonable request, especially since he attacks you specifically.|`|TIlxoclXaa	The worst way to get a dog to stop biting is to hit it or use aggression in any way. This just makes them be aggressive back. So, when people tell you to smack the dog on the nose...ignore them. The reason the dog is biting you is because he feels threatened by you. He wants Sally's love and attention and doesn't want people to interfere with that. Getting the dog neutered would help, and it is the responsible thing for the dog owner to do. Here is a trick that Victoria Stillwell uses. I really advocate her techniques because they do not use punishment like Caesar Milan. Instead they use positive reinforcement so the dog doesn't end up feeling threatened by aggression.     1) when the dog snaps at you yelp really loudly like a hurt puppy. This tells the dog he hurt you, because that is what puppies do when they hurt each other during play. However, if he is intentionally hurting you, this may not work. But it's worth a try.    2) The dog doesn't like you because he associates you with stealing attention from him. Get some training treats. Have your friend sit in the room with the dog and the treats. When you walk in the room, she needs to immediately start giving the dog treats and keep giving him treats while your in the room. As soon as he gets aggressive, leave the room and make your friend stop giving him treats. If you keep doing this, he will begin to associate you with treats and will begin to like you if he understands that good things happen when you are around.     3) If the dog is sitting with Sally and starts to be aggressive towards you in any way, Sally should immediately leave the room and not let the dog follow (close a door or something). This way the dog will begin to understand that if he uses aggression in any way, he will not get any attention whatsoever. He is being aggressive because he wants to protect his attention. If she keeps doing this he'll realize that he only gets attention when he is not being aggressive.     Hopefully Sally doesn't have to get her dog put down or anything. A lot of times it is not the dog's fault it is aggressive...it is the owner's. Good luck!|`|W07vMTQvaa	Sally needs to be trained, not the dog.  The dog does not respect her as his leader.  She is probably projecting some sort of insecurity and he is receiving her negative energy.  Do not humanize the dog with emotion.  He is not jealous or mean, he is acting out a natural instinct because he is a dog.  Sally needs to do more than "no, no" when he snaps, she needs to assert herself as pack leader.  Punishment will not work, she must establish herself as the pack leader so he does not feel the need to lead the pack (his people).    As to how to tell her, be frank and tell her that she is doing the dog a disservice by allowing him to mistrust and not be a relaxed, happy dog.  He's anxious and unhappy when he snaps and a dog should be calm and submissive.  She must walk him briskly every day to help get some of that energy out of him.  Go to the Cesar Milan's website and you'll find lots of information.|`|2LaHZXWkaa	Yes, I think neutering him is the first step. It won't cure the problem but it might help to take the aggressive edge off, and strenuouske him a little less intense. And strenuous exercise will undoubtedly help. There is no truer statement than 'a tired dog is a good dog'. If 'Sally' is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, it is doubtful that the dog has any confidence in her ability to deal with the 'threat' of you being close to her. He doesn't think she's capable of looking after herself so he is stepping up.   A crate is a great training tool, but by the sounds of it , there will have to be a rather extensive training protocol that is put in place to fix his behaviour. If he is protective, throwing him in a crate is not going to solve anything on its own. In fact, I'd be worried about him developing territorial issues as well as a result of frustrating his protective urges.  And if all else fails, feel free to tell her that a lawsuit is rapidly coming her way if the dog continues to bite you. I don't know where you live, but as far as I know, it is generally not considered allowable for dogs to bite people !
H3GrDAXPaa	Look in the local phone book for cat breeders, call them and ask if they  can help you - they usually know in a cat club or can help you find a cat club where you can get help.

w1lh1INHaa	I think you need to look into a de-wormer.  Diarrhea and vomiting are ofeten a sign of a tapeworm and/or roundworm infection (just dealt with that with a cat I took in).    You will need to take some feces to the vet so he can check it.  You probably won't even need to take the cat in, and then the vet can prescribe some meds if it is a worm infestation.    I doubt it is the food, and I cannot believe the vet said "just rest."    In the interim, you can help relieve the diarrhea by adding some Metamucil to his food, and feeding him a little canned pumpkin (no spices) if he will eat it (a little tuna juice helps with the pumpkin).    Depending upon your vet, it is very possible he will just give you the medicine even without a fecal exam, but he really does need to see another vet if the idiot you took him to just says "rest."    I think Mr. Bigglesworth is an exemplary and wonderfully uncommon name, and I am sure he will be fine if you can get him some treatment.|`|coY5RuK5aa	Well the smart thing to do would GO TO A VET !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ykDtEahMaa	I think you should take your cat to the dr as soon as you can!

5PsKGss7aa	When our dogs had kennel cough our vet said we could give them a teaspoon of Robitussin DM(i think it was the DM.. Robitussin just makes one that is just a cough depressant, there is nothing else in it .. ) in addition to their medication if they were coughing a lot.   Which we used & did work.  But check with your vet first please to first get the medication too.    (ADD:I dont get whats with the thumbs down.Our vet is a very highly educated one and confirmed that it is alright to give them this in a small,child dosage)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Speak to your veterinarian. If he did prescribe this treatment method please follow his directions. I doubt any vet would because most children's cough meds contain a sugar substitute that is highly toxic to dogs and cats. One of these fake sugars starts with the letter Z.     The last time I was at the vet with my animal, the vet told me she just treated a dog that ingested a sugar free product and he wasn't doing well.....    Always consult your avian vet if you suspect a serious illness as kennel cough.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	I've read cough medicine is pretty useless to anyone, so it wouldn't do your dog much good.

How is it that he gets it every winter?  Have you seen your vet about this issue?  Yes, you can give your dog certain over the counter cough medicines, You MUST contact your vet to find out which one to use and what dosage to give. You can HARM your dog if you do not do this.  I do believe that this would help him if, indeed, the cough was from an upper respiratory infection, however, you also need to confirm that this is truly the case. (Unlikely that it is kennel cough each winter.) There are many disease processes that have a cough associated with them. Check with your vet to make sure. Best of luck.    Lots of guessing going on here. Pretty sure I went to school for this and received a degree and passed National Boards to become certified as a vet tech.   There is a prescription cough medicine for dogs. There are also some vets that will advise their clients to use certain over the counter medicines of all types at various times. Seen it done folks.  Getting a bordetella vacc. will NOT treat an existing kennel cough infection. It is a preventative only and is not given as a normal vaccination yearly. It is given every 6 months if the dog boards on a regular basis.|`|KAiHiHkGaa	uh no i think he'll barf.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	uhh... i wouldnt do that.|`|yiR22Gabaa	It's not a good idea unless you read it from a credited veterinarians association website or in a well-read magazine for pet owners.

"Dextromethorphan/Guaifenesin (Robitussin DM ?)  This product can be used to treat coughing in dogs, cats and ferrets, at a dosage of 0.5 ml/lb every 8 hours. Make sure that it is the DM product only, and remember that coughing can be a symptom of some very serious diseases. It can also cause some mild sedation. "    Edit: MY vet has recommended it for coughing in dogs.I had two dogs with collapsed tracheas and two with congestive heart failure and she told me to use it.It does not work that well,though,and the dogs hate the taste,so I ended up getting a narcotic from my vet for them to take.But it IS safe when used at the prescribed dosage.|`|MGAmNxddaa	YES! You may,and actually it does not even have to be children's.It CANNOT contain any acetaminophen,bcause that can hurt the dog.Someone just wrote me the other night and asked me this.I looked it up to make sure of the dose for her.Robitussin and Triaminic were 2 brands specifically named in my doggy book.For large dogs they may take the adult dose,and  a really small dog gets 1/4 of the adult dose.Kennel cough is not a fatal ailment,although sometimes a dioc is necessary if it continues on too long.The average time span of kennel cough before it clears up is 2 weeks.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	I really would not do that if I were you.

IuYekkPVaa	In the UK there isn't any legislation stating that cats should not be confined.  However, they have been granted a "right to roam", meaning that neither they nor their owners can be charged with trespass if the cat enters someone else's garden or property.  They are exempt from certain laws that apply to dogs and livestock, because the law respects that cats are less likely to cause injury to people or damage to property.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	As far as the United States goes, I am not aware that has ever been done.  In the United States, pets are property and have no rights.  There have been some legislative actions that provide protection for them in the event of vet malpractice and for inheritance, but nothing that meets the premise of your question.    As far as other countries in the world, I can't help you.
qVvIiEWOaa	Im getting my maltichon end of feb.I couldnt make my mind up to get a bichon, maltese or a maltichon.As long as they are loved and cared for like one of the family, they will do there best to please. I asked the lady,out of the two breeds she has,which one is the best. She replied they are both adorable and couldnt choose between them.The mummy is a bichon and the daddy a maltese. I expect whatever one you go and visit as long as the breeder has really taken care of them and they have been bought up in a clean house . You will fall in love with the pup bichon or malichon. I DID .|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Whatever dog breed you find first on www.petfinder.com!    Adopt!|`|OXNj34gzaa	The bichon frise.    If you're considering getting a mutt. PLEASE GET IT FROM A SHELTER. There are too many BYB who are purposely breeding mutts.|`|nYv65TlEaa	if you are going to get a mixed breed,go to a shelter  other wise just bichon breed or maltese breed|`|RFfTjnxzaa	A Maltichon is not recognized as a purebred by any reputable registry (AKC, UKC, CKC). I don't know anything about the "breed" itself, but I can tell you about Maltese and Bichons.    A Bichon is a fairly high-maintenance dog. They require daily brushing and a weekly visit to the groomer to keep them looking their best. They need a nice run around the backyard every day. They are friendly, happy dogs.    A Maltese has the same grooming requirements as a Bichon. A run around the backyard is good, but not necessary. The one Maltese I ever knew was fairly ill-tempered. She bit my mother once, drawing blood. She even bit a cop once (the cop apparently thought this was cute, and that's the only reason she wasn't hauled off on the spot). She was very protective of her owner, though.    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? There are plenty of Maltese and Bichon mixes as well as purebreds out there. Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before 6 months which is too young, so be careful).
3LXbUg1raa	Basically, what your colt needs is to have his balls cut off (which you already said you are planning on doing) and to have a good, knowledgeable trainer work with him (which you also stated you are getting).  It sounds like he basically just needs to establish that you are the boss, not him, and he needs lots and lots of work on ground manners and desensitizing...|`|IVbwUy9Xaa	That sounds like a good idea. Get a nice trainer and look at some videos like Parelli (they have a thing on unbroken// rearling) Also, Gelding him would be the best thing to do.       The other thing that would help is leiing him run in a small arena or pasture. Maybe use a small whip and just stand outside, or if you are comfortable, come in and stand in the middle (basically lounging) This will get energy out and allow him to relax, over time he may become more mellowed out and not have the erge to rear, It may be because of boredom.    THANKIES :D|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	My gelded paint loved to rear up before I got him and everyone tried everything, water balloons, smacking his head, etc.  All I did was started using a breast plate and a nylon halter/bridle combo.  They make tiedowns that attach from the breast plate to the ring on the halter/bridle combo.  Unless they can pull thir head up really high, they cannot rear, just like when they cannot get their head down, they cannot buck.  It took me like two months of doing it this way with Romeo, but he finally figured he wasn't going to win, so he stopped it.  Horses are like little kids.  I didn't feel comfortable doing the other aforementioned tactics because he had previously been abused, and like kids, you don't teach them not to do things, like not hitting by hitting them.    You also have to get a slow, patient farrier.  Rome had been hit in the head with a rasp at his old home and it took him a long time to trust my farrier, but I refused to sedate him.  Once again I did the halter and breast collar thing I keep taking softly to him while hugging his head and stratching his ears.  He usually falls asleep now, big fool.  Heck it two months of walking him like a dog before I could even ride him, every over the last 7 years landed on the ground that even got near him until I got him.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Get a good reputable trainer after you geld this horse and in 6 months as the testosterone leaves his system , you should see a new horse. In the meantime , be assertive with him, but be careful.

You might not have to sell him just wait untill he matures  most young colts are like that :)|`|mVU6hgyaaa	once you geld him it will help alot but if he continuestry wraping the lead rope around his nose and when he goes to rear just aply a little force on the nose and pulll down we had one tht would do tht when you bring him to a trailer ramp|`|kjDba3wDaa	I ride western and barrel racing and such... Some of the answers on here are from english riders, but I'll tell you what I know from doing western.  First, he will calm down when he's gelded, but don't rely on that to cure him.  There are about 42 horses at the barn I ride at, all mares and geldings.  They still act up though so what I've learned is that if they rear or buck or anything of that nature, you make em work!  Eventually, they'll learn that if they do something bad, they're just going to have to do more work and therefore won't do it anymore.  I understand he's only halter-trained, but I'll give you an example for if you were riding him and he reared up.  I personally, don't think a tap in between the ears with a crop would work, but maybe it would.  Anyways, when our horses rear, we make them do circles and 360s over and over and over and over just in place.  You just keep them going and eventually you kinda know when the time to stop is.  I don't mean slow circles, I mean spurring them because otherwise it isn't work.  If they do it again, you just repeat.      Now for being scared of his shadow and rearing because of things like that, well when I first bought my mare, she reared against the hitching post EVERY time I got her out.  She eventually got over it and relaxed.  It might just been the new barn that made her upset.  She's also scared of rakes and the long stick part.  We think she might have  been beaten with it once, but we don't know.  So, to fix that, what you do is everyday you go out, you just talk to them calmly and let them sniff the object.  Move very slowly and rub it against them.  Pet them the whole time and give them a treat afterwards.  (I'm not sure if you're stallion is scared of objects but if he is, then there you go.)    For shadows and random times where he just rears, make him stand there (facing his shadow or whatever he shyed from) until he calms down.  You can't give up, because horses are smart.  They catch on if they can get away with things.     Anyways!  Hope this helped and good luck with your stallion.  I'm sure he'll get over it, he just needs time.
6j9EZXGWaa	If you put him in water that was too cool, you chilled him. He will need to warm back up and maybe then he will start moving again. You really should not handle him while he is in shed. Snakes become irritable while they are in shed and cannot see. This sets the stage for your snake to possibly bite you. Wait till after your snake has completed shedding and, if there is any retained shed, then bath him in warm water to help remove any skin that did not come off.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	um i dont think it was necessary to have put him in the water....
pMUZVP1Oaa	Yes, they can get allergies and asthma, just like people.  If your vet isn't willing to listen or help, find another vet.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes they do but it usually shows up in a different manner than in ppl.  They might have kinda watering eyes & sniffles but generally they scratch & itch & have inflamed spots on their skin. He could easily have environmental allergies.  Go to a different vet or maybe one that just specializes in cats.  Plenty of animals have allergies maybe it was the way you asked the question. I wouldn't give him any meds w/o vet approval. There are many human meds that are fatal to pets esp. cats.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	of course they do! uhh.... about the clotrimeton make sure you check you vet with that one.
L22hVXTIaa	I saw that episode too and I was appalled that people could live like that!  Actually, there have been a couple of episodes where grown dogs regularly poop all over the house and the owners just can't figure out that they NEED TO TAKE THE DOGS OUT once in a while.  They just mop the pee around their kitchen and it made me sick.  But, you can't fix stupid!!  In almost every case, once the people were given a schedule to take their dogs outside (how simple is that!), the problem was almost completely eliminated.  Just when you think you've seen or heard the dumbest thing, someone comes along and takes the trophy!|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I don't understand it either. The only excuse I can see for this kind of thing is if the dog is ill or very elderly, in which case I'd be taking it outside very often. I can sort of understand pee pads if you live in an apartment and outdoors is some distance away, the dog is small, and it's good to have a backup in case the dog is ill and can't get outside. But as a regular thing in a healthy adult dog, that people just sort of haven't figured out a way to deal with, it's completely beyond me.|`|AA11995175	i have a dog that pees in the house a lot, it's not really a big deal if you handle it correctly. while some people may just be too freakin lazy to take the dog out, some dogs have medical conditions which can affect that also. my dog is 13 years old, i got her from the humane society, she was abused for the major portion of her life and was pretty much gonna live out her life in the humane society.  but then i decided to adopt her. she is a good dog, but she pees too much. she has her own bedroom and i have put down the pee pads ( actually the ones i use are just like chair pads you would use for incontinent people) if you leave the pad there for days on end then yeah they will stink but if you change them then it isnt all that bad. so some owners should be more responsible in taking care of their dogs, but some dogs out there have certain issues which can make things difficult. using say pee pads is just a solution to a problem, just like many their solution is to take the dog and chain it outside, or dump it at the pound.|`|VtHvcEtuaa	I think that if people can allow their dogs to be doing that in their houses, they aren't the cleanest people themselves.  It says very much about them and how they keep their house|`|72e320997d1e49b1709c267c372a4a21aa	I don't know about them but one thing is sure: not very freshly.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Maybe they didn't realize how hard housebreaking would be? Or they have a dog that is hard to train. I have 2 dogs inside my own. I have a poodle mix that is 3. She goes on pee pads sometimes. When I got her 3 years ago I would rub her nose and yell at her for having accidents. Stupid of me I know. She is now fearful to go in front of me because I would shout at her. She is in the process of being trained to go outside now but it is very hard to do. I have since learned the proper way to train a dog. My puppy I have now is almost house broken. It seems easier to shout at your dog but it makes it worse. I feel terrible because of how I tried to train her. I clean my carpets good. Now she doesn't have free run of the house until she pees outside. But this is my reason. I couldn't see getting rid of her because of my own stupidity . Live and learn.|`|IjXbenddaa	Some people can survive it, barely, I guess.... But I can't!|`|veRfGJopaa	GOOD QUESTION..I have no ideal..|`|ajJViUbcaa	I think some people get accustomed to the life style their dogs give them.  Although, it's not the dog's fault, it's the owners.|`|sdAbYIV8aa	Gosh i wish i knew...saw the episode with the Greyhounds i have no idea how people could want to eat in there after... think of the bacteria ewwwwwww|`|73npx1tbaa	I guess it's how you are raised? I have three adult dogs in my house and I couldn't handle stepping in a mess in the morning. If one of my girls has to go in the night they come and wake me up to go outside! Dogs that poo in the house just need to be trained better! Oh, I was brought up to believe you don't **** in the kitchen!
hFyodb4Daa	Looks like alot I would skip on the blenny and firefish also you need much more live rock probably 15 more pounds|`|gwDftPBsaa	saltwater setup?  I would go with more corals and less fishes. Your setup would look more beautiful and attractive this way.
AraBfesHaa	My daughter just bought a 29-gallon starter kit at Petsmart for 96.94 (or 94.96) total, including tax.  It includes everything except a stand.  If you want to know what't in the box with it email me and I'll let you know.  It also has a fish net and lots of other stuff.  Petsmart had a sale (20% off) of all their aquariums this month.  Don' tknow if it's still going on or not, but if it is, today would be the last day.  Call them and ask them.  (If not, start crying, maybe they'll let you have it for sale price, LOL  Just tell them someone just told  you about it, you didn't know before).  o.k. now that I've answered your question, I have to add this:    You dont' say what size tank they're in now, but get those plecos out of there and into the 29 ASAP.  They can grow to 2' long, 29-gallons isn't enough for them either, but will hold them for a little while.  If the tank is too small they will be stunted, meaning they will stop growing on the outside but the organs inside will continue to grow, causing them a slow and very awful death.    Your best bet would be to use that $100 and get a 100 gallon tank.  If you don't have the money for anything else, use the filter, air pump and heater from the other tank, but get new ones sized for that tank as soon as you can.  The heater probably won't get the tank up to where it needs to be.  Just turn it up full blast.  That will help, but keep an eye on the temperature.  And without a proper filter, you'll probably have to do more frequent water changes until you can get one.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The fish you have bought all grow very large, so a 29 gallon tank would not be a suitable home for them. You'll need a lot more than 29 gallons. I wouldn't put those fish in anything less than 100 gallons, and I would suggest upgrading to something larger than 100 when they get larger.     Do you realize how large the clown knife will get? http://fishingjones.files.wordpress.com/...  What sort of plecos did you buy?|`|gQongGHUaa	dont get a starter kit, those can cost up too 200 dollars.  jsut get a 70 dollar tank, 10 dollar heater and small filter.  then aquascape with what u have|`|p5eodXcSaa	Remember...For every inch in a fish, they will require one gallon of water in the tank. So, if planning to have plenty of big fishies, you'll have to get a bigger tank.  But, go to: www.petsmart.com and find or browse they're prices there.
EPo7N1xBaa	Some pits have longer snouts, some have shorter snouts. That's a pit for ya, they come in different sizes and shapes, but similiar appearances.|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	The color has nothing to do with his nose.  A pit bull is not standardized by the AKC, so you're going to get different looking ones.  He'll probably just have a long snout and be dark.|`|dsTVW1WTaa	I understand your concern but like..  Why should it matter?  You love him the same even if hes a different color.    And to answer your question, He probably will get black if hes showing and his nose too. Its nothing to worry about he just has a longer nose than much, you might want to check back the papers though and just make sure they arent fakes. I've had that happen to a friend of mine before, they thought it was a reputable breeder, thought they were getting a good yorkie, and it turned out it was some terrier mix.|`|FR2bKa7iaa	he will grow into it
y0cbLn0Yaa	My 10 month old Malinois does pretty much the same thing.  He also is not dominant dog, that honour belongs to my Kelpie.  I think he just likes to be close to us and knows that if we are sitting down he will get a pat and a cuddle.  I think it is too cute.  It could also be partly a security thing as he does lean against the wall outside.    Edit:  To Kevmania - Bronson has been with us since he was 8 weeks old and has most definitely not been neglected or abused.  Of all the dogs we have ever owned I would say he is the most mollycoddled one of them all.  He is just too cute.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Some dogs are just leaners! A lot of the big dogs are for sure. I think it's their way of being close, kinda like a hug.|`|JYTcFXhhaa	she likes them|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Maybe shyness or nervousness? Or maybe she's just being friendly?    In what sorts of situations does she do this?|`|4hNRTWtDaa	It's a dog thing.  Some dogs just do this, because they want you to pay attention to them, and to get petted. :)|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	Have you had her long?  If not do you know anything about her past?  I have done rescue for many years I have noticed that neglected dogs and ones that have not been treated to well will lean into you for comfort because they finally feel loved and safe.  This is almost alway a good thing.|`|5GP3fAuvaa	My dog likes to lean against people when we are sitting down. I think it comforts them, knowing that there is someone there...
jV7SmnaTaa	Yes it is normal for her to have clearn discharge for a few weeks after the pyo surgery.    I would recommend taking her temperature.  Insert a thermometer ~1" into her rectum.  If it is below 102 - that is normal.  If it is above 104 I would consider visiting an ER vet.    Best wishes...|`|o93EwErKaa	I am not really following what you have had done for the dog so far.  Has she been spayed?  If so, than her prognosis is probably very good since the infection will be removed with the uterus.  Most likely, she had what is called open pyometra where the cervix remains open so the bacteria can escape through discharge and that is why she has few symptoms.  It is when the cervix closes, that the bacteria builds up and becomes really toxic to the body.    If you are simply giving antibiotics to clear the infection than her chances are far less than removal of the uterus through spaying.  Not only is it a less successful approach, it is likely to reoccur with the next heat cycle.  This approach is usually only used with very valuable dogs to continue breeding.    If you haven't already done so, than spay her.  Although all surgeries are a risk, the risk you are now facing with pyometra or recurring pyometra is far worse.|`|L22hVXTIaa	When you said she had surgery, I assumed you meant that they spayed her.  When they do a complete spay, the prognosis is usually pretty good unless the infection was too far gone.  I would definitely sit down with one of the vets and get a prognosis from him.  You have spent a lot of money on your dog and you deserve to get a straight forward answer from the vet as to how she is progressing.  Quite some time ago, I had an elderly dog at the vet with severe pancreatitis who was sent home after 4 days in the hospital.  The dog could not eat, drink or stand, and they kept telling me that was "okay, since it will give his pancreas more time to heal."  Yeah, a healthy pancreas inside a dead dog!  Sorry but it still infuriates me.  I finally went in with my dog and I made a scene in the waiting room.  I finally got to talk to their head vet (he quickly took me into one of the rooms to quiet me down) and we had a heart-to-heart talk and I asked some tough questions and finally got answers.  Sorry, to go on so long, but get in there and fight for your dog and some answers to your questions.  Best of luck to you - I know what you're going through.  Hugs to you and your girl.    ADD:  One last thing, if this is the same vet where your other dog died during a simple spay procedure, I think I would get a different vet.|`|rPMMCOhdaa	If your dog has pyometra, she should be spayed immediately unless you plan to breed her, which is a whole 'nother set of directions. There are 2 types open and closed.Open she is draining a tomato soup looking discharge.  Closed she may not drain until she is really sick. She may not act obviously sickly until she is comatose. My ***** did not act sick until she passed out.  Her uterus was about 2 1/2 lbs filled with infection. (Normal weight is a few ounces). The only sign I had was she didn't jump on me. Good Luck,  I am sorry you lost your other dog to anesthesia, but you have limited options with this one.  Also please be aware, her temp may be SUB_NORMAL instead of high with pyo. My ***** was saved, but developed Stump pyometra in her later years  (She was 12 when she developed Stump pyo)
DoHaUEziaa	I know what a pain this can be. I have a very large older dog who thinks he's a teacup (insert breed here) dog. lol. I found the most effective way to stop his barking is first of all teaching him to speak/bark, give him lots of praise and then tell him sternly ENOUGH, then much more praise/treats. You can use whatever phrase works for you. Both my dogs know the command QUIT but I don't have an issue with excessive or noisy barking from them both thankfully. Good luck. Woof woof. Ok, ENOUGH!|`|TTUdERZEaa	you can try getting a small thing you can put on your wall and when ever your dog barks it will wake a high pitched noise that only dogs can hear it works with all my 3 dogs i think i got mine at petco|`|nYK76GJpaa	they have a certain collar for training the dog for barking at petco, petsmart. Try one i heard they work really good|`|HT1Jb7zOaa	trying showing him/her that it is ok can and i is silly because ..... of what ever reason go with him and show him let him investigate then he will know what that noise is next time and not bother about it   it has worked very well for my 2 dogs|`|FR2bKa7iaa	Duct tape hehe.  You can buy shock devices for you're pet so when they bark it gives them a little jolt, but you cant use it all the time of course or you're dog will learn never to bark.|`|ZWgGpQ37aa	Hahaha it takes skill to calm down your dog and to get it stop barking.I have four dogs and they bark at EVERYTHING.What i do is when my dog barks i spray it with water and it stops.I do this because all my dogs are terrified of water and specially cold water.Alot of dogs dont like water so you should spray them when they bark but you'll have to do it a couple times before your dogs stops.
KxxSxznLaa	Take a treat and let your dog realize it is in your hand.  Bring it to her face in a closed fist and tuck it under her lip while still holding onto the treat.  She will try to reach at it eventually with her paw.  When she does, reward her with the treat.  Don't introduce the word "shake" to her until she has the movement down ( 20 successful shakes).  Then continue and use "shake".  Good luck!|`|B8Gwxo1laa	You should gently tap the back of your dog's paw to get him/her to raise it, saying 'shake' or whatever, and give a treat. Do this over and over, then stop tapping, just say the prompt. When he/she does it right, say 'good dog', give treat.  Over and over...|`|CDBRXtnLaa	my dogs a funny one she did it all by herself or maybe i taught her but what i did is i told her to sit then i put a treat in my hand and put it near her face and she knew she couldnt get it out by biting on my hand so she put her paw in the air to get the treat out of my hand and thats how she learns now when i say "High five!" she high fives me|`|dsTVW1WTaa	My dog does the same thing.  She kind of learned it herself, but mainly i went out with her everyday made her sit, and grabbed her paw and said shake, when she did it i rubbed her tummy. [thats her favorite treat out of anything ;] ]|`|pd5rERcfaa	This one is fun and easy.    Say "Shake" or "High five" or whatever you command you want to use.  Then lift your dog's paw up and hold it in your hand.  Drop it, say "good dog!" and give them a treat.  Repeat this and eventually your dog will learn that if she lifts her paw when you say shake, she gets a treat.    Most dogs catch on pretty quickly, good luck!|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=FiggCKvg3i...|`|Fm4RlFKfaa	Dogs will do anything for treats. Starting off you want to give the command first. (Shake, etc.) Immediately take the dog's paw in your hand and raise it up and down. Then giving the treat. You basically are trying to connect the command and the treat together, in the dog's mind. With a lot of practice and persistence your dog should understand that reacting to your command will bring a reward, the treat.|`|ea1fe0ad90bfbd91db5c9fac7052e639aa	If the dog figures out for itself what it is supposed to do the process seems to stick better, but it can take a bit longer to start with. Have the dog sitting in front of you while you hold a really yummy extra special treat in your hand. Tell your dog the command you want to use like "shake hand" then wait. The dog will try everything it already knows to see if that is what you want it to do, eventually it may lift its paw to scratch for treat, anything that even remotely resembles a hand shake should be rewarded with a small treat and plenty of praise. Do this for about 5-10 min a go and train a couple of times a day. Within a week your dog will be shaking paws.|`|vECL7f9uaa	First, u need ur dog to be able to sit.  Once this is completed just force there hand to urs and shake.  After that, reward it with a tasty treat  . Using postive rienforcement is the trick and make sure when ur training to say "shake" so that they know to do so every time u say that|`|FR2bKa7iaa	keep grabbing her paw and lifting it to shoulder length, don't give up and eventually she will fo it on her own.

We can't guess for you.|`|NwpGhT31aa	I have one of those too and she does this every now and then. Probably a cold.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Kennel cough is airborne...does she come in close contact with any other dogs?  She would even be able to pick it up in a park, or by sniffing another dog.  Sounds like a trip to the vet is in order..cough can be a sign of other illness as well.|`|dsTVW1WTaa	Dogs can get kennel cough without going to a kennel ;]  It could be a slight bronchitis, or just a cold. It is cold outside so that could be it too.  But as everyones gonna tell you, take it to a vet just to check. It could be nothing, it could be serious its best just to be safe.
3sB49YNnaa	Sometimes it is easier to do with the pig upright rather than turned over.  We just sit them on a towel on a hard surface (in our case, the top of the wide back of an overstuffed chair).  Ours are used to it and it is a one person job but you might want to have one person control the head while the other gently pulls the foot slightly away from the body and clips the nail avoiding the quick.  They tend to be much less freaked out when they have all four feet on the ground.      You might want to have a little container of corn starch handy in case you miss and go too deep.|`|ufc4JKRkaa	here is a great link with pics  http://www.guinealynx.info/nails.html|`|OxOIhuXEaa	you could go to a vet, or wrap it in a towel and only let one foot stick out (then cut it, and then do it to another one)    or if you let it run on a hard surface rock brick etc. it should wear the nails down    or place a brick in it's cage so it wears the nails down      hope it works
W07vMTQvaa	Sounds like she's enjoying a game.  Do you all "ooh ahh" when she shows you the bone treat?  LOL, she may just be reacting to you!  Give her a treat, pat her head and then ignore her.

They may be tamer than the Big cats, but they are still related. It is their nature to hunt, stalk, and play. Cats always fight or pick on other cats of the same sex as they are trying to prove who is the alpha cat. Even the females do this. When they decide who is boss they will from time to time keep the others in line to remind them they are the boss cat. It's just their nature, just like the cats in the wild.|`|3ybVdfMEaa	Get them fixed. ASAP.     Not only will that cut down on the aggression but it will prevent any female cats in the neighborhood from getting pregnant by your toms. There are enough kittens getting put to sleep in shelters.

jV7SmnaTaa	I would be very concerned about a kidney problem.  Typically when dogs smell like urine they have kidney disease.  I would visit the vet if bathing doesn't help.|`|nYv65TlEaa	can it be whats in her food,talk to your vet|`|FR2bKa7iaa	stop peeing on her.  I think i would go with the kindney prob aswell.|`|AA11440635	I agree with Kati, How old is your dog? My dog used to always smell like urine 2 because he had incontinence (i think that's how u spell it).  That usually is signs of a kidney problem and you really need to take your dog to the vet. Just prepare yourself that it might not be good news as i had to put my dog down. (sob sob) Mind you my dog did have cancer also or they may have been able to save him. Good luck with it hope all works out.|`|c136976c6511524190fa02f0f9005a0eaa	I had that same problem with my Yorkie-Poo.

My Charley goes where the wipes  are. He knows the drill!!  Hope this helps. Check the pet isle they make them for pets also and they are much bigger.    Good Luck!
jWmnSXlLaa	Around 2 -3 lbs. It depends on how big her parents are also.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They don't put on much weight as young pups, it's more for growing.  As she gets older then she will add size & muscle , they come last. The rule is at 16wk double the weight to get adult size. So she should be about 2.5-3lb grown.  Lil bitty doggie!!|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	Here is a link to a chihuahua puppy growth chart that should help.      http://www.prouxchihuahuas.com/id57.html|`|bUL2Pyx3aa	she wont get to much biggerthan 8lb's  unless she is mixed with something.|`|OXNj34gzaa	AN OVERGROWN RAT.

c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	SHE is not retarded.  YOU aren't providing a proper environment for her.  We call that improper husbandry.  My guess is your temps aren't right, you aren't using a digital thermometer and you aren't providing her with a humid hide to aid in shedding.    Go get a digital thermometer with a probe and measure the hottest spot of your tank.  If it's not in the 88-92 range, you need to get it there.  Too far off there is going to reduce appetite, thus her not eating.  Then go get a small tupperware container, cut a hole in the side and fill it with moist sphagnum moss.  Put it on the warm side of the tank.  That should help her skin loosen and be much easier for her to shed.    That said, you should never be "peeling" skin off of your gecko.  Ever.  They have very thin skin you could very easily damage by just ripping it off.  If you need to help her, soak her in warm water up to her armpits and use a q-tip to roll the soft skin off.    She's probably slow because she's too cold... when you get your husbandry to where it should be, she should perk up.  If she doesn't perk up within a week or so, it's a good idea to get her and a fecal sample to a vet to check for parasites.  With the stressful situation she's in right now, it wouldn't surprise me if she has some sort of parasite load.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Seeing as how it is alread 2-3 yrs old it is not going to be easy to introduce new foods to her diet,you may never get her to.But one thing you should try is baby food.This fattens them up quickly,and they are drwn to it because of the smell.As far as not being able to catch the crickets i would use a small rubbermaid bin to feed in.Put her and the crickets in the box and leave her there for twenty minutes.The more you hand feed the less she will hunt.Hope it helped yours truly the lizard lady|`|uo2sGuvWaa	I was going to answer to this but Saucy covered it. I have one thing to add though, you should feed her every other day not every two days.|`|cv1lTP7haa	My brother's leopard gecko was initially slow with catching food, but that was because he was recovering from a disorder caused by nutrient deprivation. If your gecko's that young and moving that slowly, she's in too cold of temperature, isn't feeling well due to an illness or nutrient deprivation, or has some sort of neurological/motor skill problem. Consistent bad shedding means the environment probably isn't suitable for it - make sure she has a hide box kept damp and moist to go in at all times, especially during shedding. Finickiness with food is nothing new to a reptile. You can try appetite enhancers or putting the mealworm in somewhere for a few minutes where it will pick up the cricket's scent. No guarantees. Patience and learning your gecko's feeding routine are the only ways to get her trying new food or eating more consistently.    You might want to see if you can gently get some of the mealworm into her mouth, which would encourage her to bite it and realize that it's actually food.
enC9TvxUaa	-They will and it is normal.|`|Dl0Rbx1Eaa	YES THEY DO    if their is no female and if there is they will really do it to both gender.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	Some do, some don't  It's common for same-sex parrots to form pair bonds with the same sex.  Two males will mate, build a nest, do everything but lay actual eggs.    Similarly, two females will do the same thing and both supply their nest with eggs.    At one bird seminar I attended the number one reason given why breeding pairs of parrots are unsuccessful is because they are the same sex!  This is why parrots often have to be DNA sexed--you can't always tell gender by behavior.    However, not all birds behave this way.  I've had female budgies live together before, none of them displayed homosexual behavior.  I've heard of other people having it, though.
bUL2Pyx3aa	I had 2 siberian hamsters and they had a lot of babies over a period of time. what you want to do is.....    1. keep the father away before she has her babies because he will try to mate with her as soon as she has had them so wait about 3-5 days before you let him back with the mother and babies.he woint eat them he actualy rears them, syrine hamsters will eat them.    2. move the cage into a dark room away from a lot of noise and movement. i covered the cage with a blanket so she will feel secure. DO NOT move the blanket at all.    3. leave her alone in the cage for 4 to 6 weeks only mess with the cage to feed her and give Her water do not take her out. the reason is she will eat her babies because she thinks you are a threat to them so please do not mess with them.    4. feed her boiled eggs and cheese because it makes her make more milk.    5. after she has the babies do not touch them for 4 weeks or until thier eyes open and they have hair. they usuallyy have 6 babies.    we had a lot of babiebecausese the parentkeptpt omatingng sseparatete the boys and the girls. good luck ( my male never ate the babies but the mom did once, the male played with them)|`|rMTq7yMyaa	Post your question at www.hamsterhideout.com/forum    The members are friendly and may be much more informative and helpful than some people on Y!A.    Hoped I helped!|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Male hamsters are better parents than the females actually  - the females are the ones that will eat the young if they're injured, ill, or she feels threatened.    Some advice from Lucy the Hamster Vet:    New pups    A hamster that has given birth should be disturbed as little or possible or she may become agitated and abandon, neglect, or even eat the babies. This means other than providing food and water, you should leave the hamsters and their cage alone as much as possible for the first couple of weeks. While it is tempting to look at the babies and make sure everything is okay, it is best to leave the mom to do her thing. Don't try touching the babies, I know how adorable they are but please don't. While it is okay to have a quick peek in the cage on occasion, avoid siting and watching for long periods. Wait until they are about 2 week old. Also, at 4 weeks old, make sure to separate the male and female pups. (you could end up with a TON more if you don't!) The girls can stay with mom but the boys need their own cage. At 6 weeks they can be re-homed and will all need their own cages.|`|RHUDduUbaa	1.separate male 7 female  2.keep an eye on them they sometimes eat their babies espesially the males|`|oHKpy4IRaa	yes it is true the male will eat the babies if you do not separate them. Do not tuch the babies or the mother (she will be aggressive cuz of the babies). All you need to do is give the mother fresh food and water and do not tuch the babies cuz then the mother will eat them cuz they do not have her scent on them.    good luck|`|ucxBvsX6aa	You should separate the father he'll eat the babies.  But don't touch the babies or mess with the mom until their fur starts coming in. Take it from experience!  And the mom might eat her babies if it's her first litter.   Your best bet after these babies is seperate the mother and father and get rid of the babies quick!   Because they will reproduce fast!  Even when there really small.
