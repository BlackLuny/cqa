I planted the salad greens on 12/28 and they started growing beautifully.  Then just stopped after 10 days @ 1" high.  The light is @ its lowest setting, the pump is working fine, the room temp is 60 degrees.  I used bottled drinking water & followed the unit directions to the letter.  Impossible to contact Aero Customer Service.  I changed out the water & replaced it w/distilled.  The greens are shriveling, drying out, slowly dying.   They are now @ 4 1/2 weeks & still an inch high.  I've given up & will start over & try the cherry toms.  I'm @ a loss (in more ways then one!) and a little pissed to say the least.  Any one have this problem or suggestions?

I am caring for a friend who is bed ridden, while pregnant. Her husband is less that desirable in the cleaning department and has a habit of dropping food everywhere, then walking on it and grinding it in. It doesn't just come up with a vacuum and I don't want to Resolve the entire apartment on my hands and knees seeing as how I am pregnant too. I have a Steam Cleaner myself and wanted to bring it over and really clean it so they don't get nabbed when they want to move out. Its not normal wear and tear for a year old apartment thanks to the husband. She says there isn't anything she knows of in the lease, but shes afraid if something were to get too wet or what not that they will charge her for it. My vac works nice and doesn't leave too much water behind. So I am wondering has anyone had any problems with this in there apartments?      ALSO can I request a Professional to do it? I was talking to some of the moms group about pitching together and getting a Professional to come and do it.

20090128163058AAvPpUD	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Several Elm Tree questions?	How many kinds are there? I have heard of American Elms, Chinese Elms, Red Elm and Piss Elms. I think that maybe the last two are just reference names.    Red Elm because the wood has a reddish color to it and maybe that is actually an American Elm. The tree referred to as Red Elm was killed off with Dutch Elm Disease.    I don't think that the Chinese Elm was affected that much because there are still some around.   I think that the Elm referred to as a Piss Elm is probably a volunteer Chinese Elm that does not get as big because of bad locations like fence lines and other timber growth close by.   Could someone enlighten me on this?   I would also like to know if American Elms would grow in the area again since Dutch Elm disease is long past.

20090128164358AAVXMrY	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Redecorating my room, suggestions?	I'm seventeen and I'm getting ready to redecorate my room. I want it to be a room I'm comfortable bringing my boyfriend home to next year when I'm in college, or a room my friends admire.    I'm really into fashion and my mom refuses to paint black or red in her house, so it throws out black and white or dark maroon and beige.   It's a small room and has a purple carpet I find ugly, but can't get rid of.   Help please!?

20090128165728AAiON5y	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Splitting and running new wire?	Hey guys. My brother and I are doing a little re-vamp in our bathroom. The bathroom has one circuit wire, it comes up through the floor and it goes to one receptacle by the doorway, straight up from that to a switch for a light, then up to the one light in the center of the room. What I want to do is keep this light, but add a vanity light on a wall. I have an idea of how to pursue this.       I was thinking of cutting the wire after it comes up from the receptacle, this will be BEFORE it goes to the light switch, putting in a junction box with one wire coming in the bottom and two coming out the top, connecting all the hots and neutrals and grounds. Both wires coming out the top will have its own switch, so now there will be two switches.       The one switch will control the ceiling light, and the other switch will control the new vanity light. I wanna do it this way because i want the two fixtures to turn on separately.....to save power and be more efficient.        I am sure this plan will work. Can you assure me?   Thanks for all of your help! I appreciate it.      -J.

A contractor recently informed me that it is okay to leave my existing window uncovered in a new shower install. Another contractor stated that this was risky and the window should be "built over" due to future water damage.   I like the idea of still having the natural light in my soon-to-be bathroom, but I don't want the risk of ruining my house foundation. Have I been misinformed or is this a possibility?  Thanks so much for your answers!

20090128172351AA5okPa	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Storm drains not working?	The storm drain in front of our house and the one in front of our neighbor's house across the way drain excrutiatingly slowly. Rain has to completely stop in order for the water to flush away.      Right now there is an ENOURMOUS lake on the street between our properties. It is about 1' 5" deep. We cannot close the gates since the water is too deep there. It comes halfway up our driveway (same with the neighbors) and cars have to slow down or water splashes real high. After the rains, there's always floating debris that has washed ashore our lawns.      So we've called the town many tims as this has been happening on & off over 20yrs now. They always 'fix' the problem with their machinery and to no avail. This keeps happening. What to do? Any suggestions would be extremely helpful.

20090128173754AA0973V	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Why am I running out of hot water in the shower so fast?	We were having issues with our water heater before, at 15 minutes lukewarm/cold water would start coming out of the showerhead.  The plumber replaced the heating elements, but there was no change.  Finally, he replaced the entire thing because the high mineral content of the water had basically filled up the drum (10+ year old heater).  So now we have a new 40 gal heater, but we are still running out of hot water before I can shampoo the conditioner out of my hair.  The temp is set at 130C, and if someone takes a shower right after there IS hot water for a few minutes but then it runs out again.

My 2 year old son really loves the color pink (any shade really) and he has for quite a few months now. His new room is painted a bright pink (like a neon or hot pink color). It looks really cool and he really likes it. I am stuck on how to decorate his room with out it looking too very girly.       He is really into cars (the movie and regular cars). Trucks, trains, firetrucks, school buses, etc. His favorite characters are Carebear's, Blue's Clues, Dora and Diego and a few other cartoon characters. He really loves fish and stars. So, I don't know what to do here. The things he is into don't really go very well with a bright pink room.       I was thinking with going with a star theme, but I'm not totally decided yet. Any decorating ideas would be really helpful. Also accent colors would help to. I would like to put curtains up (I don't really like blinds in his room), but I don't know what color to put with the pink. Thanks in advance for any helpful ideas.

20090128182832AALNkFq	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Gas Furnace Not Working Properly?	I have a gas forced air furnace that shuts off prematurely.  It lights fine and will start burning for a few seconds and then it will stop like it has reached the temperature the thermostat is on.  The thermostat appears to be reading and working properly.  I read somewhere before this problem could be the heat flame sensor.  I have taken a rag and wiped it off just in case there was fine dust.  It will work for a day or two and then start acting up again.  I have also changed the filter and made sure it is clean, but that doesn't work either.  Does this sound like a heat flame sensor or is it something else?  Does it require a technician to come out and fix or is it something I can do?  How much should this cost?
