e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	How to fight spam and scams:     1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.    You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.    Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:  http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...     2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.    When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions.     http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...     3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...    Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.    Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.    MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.    Note: the program is free but limited to one email account. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.    http://www.mailwasher.net/

While it may seem really restrictive sometimes, it can also help new members realize what questions are worth more to answers rather than just answering a bunch of polls.

All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|IxuMTGd4aa	You need to keep answering questions until your get 250 Points.|`|AA10520442	You need 250 points.

Omit the link, and then post the link after you've submitted the answer. It should work after that.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	You've either reached your daily quota for answers or there's a fault with your PC or at Yahoo.

Of course, in doing this, they fail to realize that "answering" a question with a response that in no way attempts to actually answer the question is a violation of community guidelines. The person could not only potentially lose the two points that they got for the answer, but an additional ten points for the violation.|`|nl7tkxc3aa	Wow; i agree.        ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  VROOM!!!!!!!!!      =]|`|AA10076207	it's called points baiting. they answer to get easy points. i hate em,too.|`|m5J36D28aa	They are in a desperate search for a life for themselves.|`|eOb841qbaa	there isnt. its just that they just get 2 points lol.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	to get points|`|tp61e25Eaa	Dumb people think that is a answer.|`|QA7IOoqMaa	To get points, so they can get proper answers to their own questions!!|`|IGz2wBj5aa	I think it's because so many people say the exact same thing.

Yahoo! Answers employee Jane said;"These limits help new members get to know a bit more about Yahoo! Answers before they start just asking and answering like crazy. While it may seem really restrictive sometimes, it can also help new members realize what questions are worth more to answers rather than just answering a bunch of polls.

Not only will this help good answers be rewarded, but it will also help you progress to the next level more quickly."     :o)|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Limits are put in place to prevent spam. If everyone could answer to an unlimited extent, then there would be so much spam floating around the site, and I guess the Yahoo! Answers team doesn't want to deal with a lot of spam. However, once you get to level five, there are pretty much no more limits. I guess once you get to level five, the team trusts you to behave responsibly.|`|UspK4SQBaa	To give you an incentive to work towards a higher level.    Also, a lot of the people with newer accounts are trolls, and without limits, they would post garbage all day and night.|`|AA10520442	Because they want newbies to learn about the site before they are granted unlimited access and they want to limit spambots.|`|9q7UPZIfaa	So you won't cheat with silly, short, and no effort in actually answering the questions.

But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|3PfkXTouaa	holy crap!! thats a nice page!! i really like it! =] keep up the good work!|`|tp61e25Eaa	Interesting.

You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer.

FgFmj8d2aa	I really think getting best answer has more to do with answering questions you're knowledgeable about and/or answering questions with an accurate, well thought out response (even if it's not your expertise but you've researched it for them) than how many you answer. Quality over quantity, to put it simply. For example, I answer a lot of questions on "education" topics and in "words and wordplay" because I'm good at English and writing, and I'm also a teacher.     It's pretty easy to tell the difference between people whose mission it is answer a ton of questions with irrelevant, rude, or "I don't know" answers just to get the 2 points and those who consistently answer questions with higher-quality answers, albeit fewer of them, because they're genuinely interested in helping the asker.     The former are the type that really defeat the purpose of this site and obviously don't have much of anything to contribute.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Well, answer in categories you are knowledgable in. Be thorough, but be succinct, if possible.|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Sometimes they just don't like you.|`|Xe94coYQaa	You just have to be rated high.

They pick the answer that they like the best and a lot of it is people that are in the same little click will give their friends the Best Answer even if it's not correct. Hang in there.
AA10421992	Click on your avatar, go to your profile & click on the green tab "activity summary  There you should see if you may have received a violation.  Check your email inbox as well.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Well, usually you will get an email from yahoo telling you that you have violated the guidelines or that someone has reported you and you will lose points for that. You also lose 5 points for every question that you ask. So if none of these things have happen, then I don't know what's going on. You can email yahoo and ask them to look into it for you. Hope you find those points.

The number of points you get depends on the specific action you take. The points table below summarizes the point values for different actions.

The more points you accumulate, the higher your level. Yahoo! Answers recognizes your level achievements with our special brand of thank you's!

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sorry, but without some background, this question is very hard to answer. On THIS site, the 'answer box' is the text box that you type your answer into when you want to answer a question. For example, I clicked ON your question, click the 'Answer this questin' button under the question and that opened up an 'answer box' for me to type this answer into.

But I did some research and found that she is a photographer from London/UK. I also found that she has an active account with usefilm.com, a very nice photo community. I don't know whether you have to be a member of that site in order to get in touch with another member, but you could try to send a mail to usefilm.com and ask them about it.    https://www.usefilm.com/photographer.asp... - the link to her profile  http://www.usefilm.com/Contact_Us.asp - the contact page for usefilm.com

6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped!

Ive lived through quite a lot of them.|`|jxqNTr9Iaa	I don't think friday the 13th has any misfortune lined up for me,,afterall the unlucky aspect aportioned to friday the 13th comes from it being a friday the 13th that the pope and king of France turned on the Knight's Templer excomunicating them and imprisoning them across most of Europe.    As I have no religion to speak of I can't see any cause for concern (touch wood !!!)    I believe I was accidently cursed yesterday.I bought 20 cigarette's and an energy drink.    The lad behind the counter said,     'You know there a curse on you all day',looking at him perplexed I saw the price on the till display 6.66.    'Well least it aint Friday the 13th n'all',I joked bout it.    Funny enough though almost everything I did yesterday and through today seemed to cause trouble.

T6nmD3X9aa	I am very honest in my answers, sometimes too honest. I joke around too. But every once in a while someone gets ticked at me. I always go back and check them out later on (neurotic I guess) but I am curious. Sometimes askers add on snotty comments about what I said or whatever! Sometimes it is amusing to me, sometimes I get ticked because they ask a question I answered seriously (I am a nurse) and they tell me I dont know what I am talking about, only because they are only waiting to hear the answer they WANT to hear instead.     Usually those people are under 17, but yea, there has been a few     LOL    What about you?    UPDATE: See? I check back! LOL. Best thing I can say about her is that she is an idiot. Best advice: ignore her and block her. You asked questions because you wanted an answer, it was her choice to be obnoxious about it and keep it going. If she thinks she is getting to you she will continue this garbage, ignore her and she will move on to another poor Y! asker.

If you want a cartoon figure then go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and create or modify one and then go to part 3.  2? If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions. Mark the one you want to use as primary.  3? Now for either a cartoon or a picture save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or picture there to use.  BE SURE TO SAVE THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM.

The exact qualifications are kept secret but rumors indicate that it is a minimum of 10% best answers and about 40-50 individual answers in the category every month.    Once you get the badge you must keep up your activity in the category or you will lose it.    ? ??l???q ?|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Yes thats it mate.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To be a TC, you need to show knowledge in one to three different categories, except Polls & Surveys and Jokes & Riddles. Choose the three you want to be a TC in, and just keep answering in the categories. Ideally, you need ten percent best answer, but I'm not sure, for I've seen people with seventeen percent best answer overall with two TC badges. Whatever it is, you need to prove that you are knowledgeable in a certain category, and the Yahoo! Answers community will allow you to have the badge(s).|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.

If he asked how many men I slept with I would tell him honestly! you build a relationship on honesty. And then I would ask him the same question.    Unless you are very promiscuous and have slept with ALOT of men... in that case I would alter the number down a bit! :)|`|RP6dDFTsaa	no I wound not tell a boyfriend, now if it was someone you are talking about getting married and he asks then yes. and as for the question how many men you slept with, take the   divide by 4 then that's the answer.

All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|sxo9dznQaa	you answer people's questions.

AA11307940	Yahoo was contacted about this and say it's a glitch, they have their engineer working on the problem. In the meantime open the inbox, click View All Messages, then unread messages, if you have any late arrivals or in folders they will show.  This has been happening to many of us while using the Classic Mail since Yahoo has been upgrading the Classic and other sites. It did clear on it's own, it took a few days. Yours will too.
AA11307940	In the email that they sent out to us tell us to download our files back to our computer, they are not offering a new service. With our unlimited storage in the email now, they say we can use that. Some are transferring things to My Documents on the computer. Maybe Windows office has storage. If we don't move our files out they will be deleted and not able to get them back. Maybe you could use a backup, I have things on a flash drive for safe keeping.
