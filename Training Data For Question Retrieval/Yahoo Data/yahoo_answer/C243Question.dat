20090202164053AA3SO2m	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What was your MOST embarrassing moment?	I have a few.   Alright, so I have a crush on this one guy.. And i ripped my pants that day so I had to go to the nurse. So when i was walking back from the nurse i came around a corner and it turns out that he was coming around a corner also.. We both knocked straight into each other and i was blushing so hard because he supposedly had a crush on me too. It may not seem as horrible to you as it does to me.. but if you run straight in to your crush.. then you might feel a little like an idiot.    Another time was when I stood up in front of the whole entire class. Everyone was just cracking up and I was like "huh?" i walk back to my seat to see my fly was undone.      I was once on my period so i had my small little clutch with me. i forgot to zip it and things just come pouring out in front of everyone.

There's this girl in my class who's a right missy, a bit snobby and a bit stuck up and I wouldn't ever trust her with a secret.   She's quite pretty apparantly according to boys (and she even says so herself) though, really skinny and all the boys seem to worship her even though she's such a cow! :/   Please help me understand- the boys always flirt with her and she reciprocates and they like keep picking her up and teasing her and she giggles and stuff but sometimes she will be in a huge mood over nothing and ALL the boys want to know whats wrong and even if she's really horrible to them they don't care and they are concerned about her. Everything shes says captures their attention and they find everything that she says really funny, she has hoards of boys around her all the time, but how come?   You can't talk to her properly and she's horrible so what is so attractive about her? Surely looks don't count for everything?   Don't boys like someone they can trust and who is nice rather than her? :s      Thanks :)

20090202140023AATPoUd	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Movie Revolutionary Road?	This movie really looks at that unsatisfying feeling that perhaps all marriages encounter. My friend and I were debating after we saw it. We are both unmarried. I argued that all marriages feel hopeless at some point and I feel that I am sure I will feel hopeless at sometime knowing that my life is figured out, i.e. this is who I will be married to, this is the job I will have, these are the kids I will have. She said that some people manage to make life exciting even among such routine. My life already isn't exciting so I worry I will just be boring WITH another person. That is scary. What do you think?

I'm hearing that aquarians do not make very stable partners, they don't really feel much possessiveness towards their partners (whereas a little is healthy) and they are often aloof-they will be dedicated one day and then the next day disconnected.

20090202135920AAUEyML	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	I've been wondering about this ever since the episode Criss Angel Is A Douchebag...?	In a TV Guide interview done by Eric Kripke, that I can't seem to find anymore, during the hiatus.                 Three things that he said caught my eye:                     1.  The next four episodes were going to be all about the brother.                 2.  Ruby going to get Sam to use his powers again.                     3.  We will find out what the angels really want from Dean.           Okay...two out of three have already happened in the past episodes, and there is only one left until the next hiatus(or so they say) so do we find out what the angels really want from Dean in the episode Sex and Violence?  or Did I just totally read that article wrong?  Can someone ease my confusion?

After a year of that I figured it wasn't my type of field, it was boring to me and complicated. Music was where I wanted to be, piano to be exact.       So I changed my major to music and started taking music classes. My goal was to hopefully become a school piano teacher, not the type that goes to peoples houses and teaches, but the classroom type. So far i'm loving music and its great.    So far I know what classes I have to take, other than that I really dont know what it takes to become a teacher. Do I have to get like some kind of license and credentials and all that stuff? Someone give me some tips so I can start working on it now.

Which of the two is a better conversation starter or looks unique(-er)      It's either a blue totoro shirt. which is very kawaii     http://www.iksentrik.co.uk/images/totoro...       or    a "Beware of Panty Thieves" Shirt.

20090202203638AAlwbFC	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	9 months later...a must read for all men?	Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. So they loaded up Jack's minivan and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.    "I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house."    "Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light." The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.   But about nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend.    He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?"    "Yes, I do." Said Bob.   "Did you, er, happen to getup in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?"    "Well, um, yes!," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out, "I have to admit that I did."    "And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?"   Bob's face turned beet red and he said,   "Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did." "Why do you ask?"                      "She just died and left me everything."

Nothing too complicated, if you can, but I'm willing to practice, obviously.    =/ So, any ideas?            BQ: Uh. What brand are your shoes?

20070311051146AAt4MSt	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Does anyone here watch Naruto on YouTube?	I had been watching Naruto on Cartoonnetwork with my son since it first came on air. I liked the show because it had a lot of action, interesting soundtrack, and a relatively deep plot. I started watching Naruto on Youtube soon after season 2 ended because I was anxious to see the second part of the Chunin exams.  These were the English dubbed versions, and I realized that CN was watering the episides down for the younger american audience. I was amazed at how deep and twisted the characters lives were in the dubbed versions and I started watching 3 and 4 episodes a night. From episode 53 to episode 134 it seemed like all of the characters were developing in strength and wisdom. The action was really intense, and successive episodes seemed to go through waves of incredible intensity as Naruto and Sasuke final face off in a head to head battle. And then something changed. The episodes started to get weaker and less interesting.  Now I'm at episode 177 and the show is really boring.

And in another part of the video, there's a naked woman in a puddle of blood but not a dead woman. A woman bathing in the blood. I believe the artists name started with an M.

20070315152822AAiSMNh	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I can't think of the name of this movie!!!!!?	Back in the 90's I saw a movie about twin sisters who had a rivalry with each other.  They slept with each other's men and used their sex appeal against each other.  There was a sex scene in a hot tub, and it was probably rated NA.  I thought it was called Mirror Image, but can't find a movie with that name with this description.  It's driving me crazy just not being able to remember the name.  The twins were blondes and may have been the same actress playing two roles.  I believe that one of them ends up killing a guy after sleeping with him and pretending to be the sister.  Can anyone help me out?

The film involved something supernatural like ghosts or time travel. It was kind of similar to Tom's Midnight Garden so i might be confusing the two. I think it was a British film...or possibly Australian. And i think the boy wore a white t-shirt for most of it. I know this is extremely vague, but any help at all would be much appreciated!

20070406182437AAksFOl	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Tis joke is kinda wrong...but is it funny??	A joke that has a moral?!?      A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road. He stopped and offered her a lift which she accepted. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly had an accident.      After controlling the car, he stealthfully slid his hand up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Father, remember psalm 129?"      The priest was flustered and apologized profusely. He forced himself to remove his hand. However, he was unable to remove his eyes from her leg.      Further on while changing gear, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again Said, "Father, remember psalm 129?" Once again the priest apologized. "Sorry sister, but the flesh is weak."      Arriving at the convent, the nun got out, gave him a meaningful glance, and went on her way.       On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a bible and looked up psalm 129. It Said, "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."      MORAL OF THE STORY: Always be well informed in your job, or you might miss a great opportunity

I travel much on business,   But no reindeer haul me around,   I do all my traveling firmly on the ground.      I love the time of Christmas,   But that's not my vocational season,   And I assure that is because of a sound economic reason.

But here's the twist, as a rail-thin runway model you'd make a really good living but you'd be nowhere near rich.

20090203000307AA8spHu	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Theories about Heroes: Fugitives that just aired?	Here are the main possibilities that I see for the story so far for Heroes: Fugitives after seeing the first episode that just aired.    It greatly bothers me that Peter has to 'touch' to reacquire any abilities. Both Peter and Sylar have empathized without touching. Are the writers changing the the rules of the show? OR... maybe Peter acquired Arthur's power stealing ability -- which was wholly dependent on touch. Maybe Peter is too perturbed to empathize, and he has been instead stealing powers.    The other thing that bothers me is Nathan. Does he really believe this crap? Maybe. But if not... Well.. maybe he knows something we don't about the future... which is certainly possible given Angela is with him and she is a precog. Also, maybe he lost his powers if Peter stole them when they last flew away together?    But wasn't anything bothersome about Arthur's "death"? He may really be dead. But, even if Sylar seized control of the situation, he could NOT have stopped Arthur's crafty mind-techniques. He could well have made it only APPEAR that he died. In reality he may BE the Nathan in this season. He has several ways of pulling this off. He may be using elaborate telepathy, have shapeshifting, or maybe even some kind of possession ability. If he possessed Nathan, maybe Peter stole is powers when they flew away together. Granted this line of idea does not explain why Bennett and Angela are aiding him.    Any other ideas about the plot of this season so far?

I watched a slasher movie when I was in the 3rd grade.  I shouldn't have but some babysitter let me stay up to watch it.  It's haunted me my whole life.  It starts off with a bunch of girls at a slumber party having a topless pillow fight in a new neighborhood, one that's just being developed.  All the high school girls boyfriends come over to scare them and suddenly there is this crazy murderer around whose chasing them all with chainsaw.  They end up running around the neighborhood and newly built houses to get away from him.  I don't remember what happens because I was totally scarred at that point.  I do remember that the murder wore a black leather jacket.  I want to know what movie this is so I can watch it and laugh so it won't haunt me ever again.  What movie is this?

20090202230523AADtZby	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Which is the best match for a cancer female?	Leo, Taurus, Libra, Aquarius, Capricorn or Pisces?      I like leos but they're so self-centered sometimes that they completely exclude me. Tauruses I feel are too blunt or cold for me? Capricorns I really like, really quite some possibility there. Pisces is definitely an excellent match. Libra is sweet but I totally don't know!?? Umm..Scorpio is attractive to me of course just like they are to everynody else lol but I like them better as friends because I feel like they are too serious or headstrong for me in a relationship. I definitely need someone more lighthearted amd easygoing. Virgo is nice, but it is a tad hmm I dunno like I like how they treat me but they themselves I wouldnt be able to respect bevause they are so analytical. but it is better than taurus cuz taurus can be cold and a little lost when it comes to sensitivity. I love aquriuses great chemistry, but eventually i think we're better off as friends because of their detachment from their emotions. I need them to be more connected to them in a love relationship.      So I think pisces is the best match? It's pretty close with leo to me tho it beats it. But i just wish leos werent so selfcentered dangit lol. So tell me, what are your personal experiences?!? Please share dear moon children!!

20090202222255AAkz0xe	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Pink Floyd - Sorrow, what do these lyrics mean?	And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication   And silent replies that swirl invitation   Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea   A grim intimation of what is to be   There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night   And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight   And silence that speaks so much louder than words,   Of promises broken      I have never been dumbfounded by a Floyd song, but these lines have been bugging me for a long time.      PLEASE don't say the lyrics don't mean anything. I really like this song, but it confuses >.<

I don't know as you can see I'm confused help please??? because some people take it as a christian song ( jason castro) and although it  says hallelujah it seems like he didn't mean it like that it was kind of like a christian turn atheist hallelujah. type thing   here is the jeff Buckley cover of the song if you need to hear it:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AratTMGrH...

As the manager of a pet store, I was the person that customers came to with their problems. When they had complaints I would listen to them and tell them I understood their concerns. I would then try and resolve the issue, if I was unable to do this to their satisfaction then I would direct them to the companies owner.       What was the most/least rewarding aspect of your last job?      My least rewarding aspect was dealing with negative co workers, I get along well with people, but ut caused an unwelcome work atmosphere.       The most rewarding aspect by far was the interaction I got to have with the customers.

A clever Usul figured out a great way to catch fish in the Underwater Fishing Cavern. (However, in the spirit of fairness, we won't reveal her secret!) The first day she went fishing, she caught exactly 31416 pounds of fish!       Even though she had more fish than she knew what to do with, she decided to go fishing again the next day. And she caught exactly 40% of what she caught the day before. Which was still a lot of fish.       She continued fishing every day. And every day she caught exactly 40% of what she caught the previous day.       If she continued fishing every day for twenty years, how many pounds of fish, total, would she catch? Please round to the nearest pound.

The girl was killed by hanging her and using her as a dart board. And the knives were used as darts. The killer died because one of his men poisoned him.      So, can anyone tell me? Thanks!

So even though it looks like they're gona give up the baby for adoption I dont think it is going to happen. Wouldn't that make the show kinda pointless after she has it? I mean originally it was about her struggle being a young teen mother, so if she gives it up for adoption, she's just a run of the mill 15 year old with high school drama. Like every other high school show out there. I think they're gona have her keep it in the end and raise it with Ricky, because without that factor the show is just like all the others, and people may tune out. Plus I hope she keeps it. I know she's 15 but I know people who have made it work.

Hey guys, I need to talk all "street" for this short film I am in, and its not supposed to be a realistic, serious portrayal of it - I am actually a girl who is actually playing a BOY, who THINKS he's all tough and gangster, but isnt...i guess i play a "wigger" - i dunno if thats the proper terminology, but yes, I know I will make a fool of myself..i think thats the point, so I guess the more cheesier or the more "poserish" the talk, the better!    so if any of you guys have any suggestions for saying things such as "how was your weekend",  "last week was so awesome, I did (blank)" - or if you have any good sayings for pick up lines, that'd be very helpful.  But... there cant be any curse words - this video is sort of PG rated, so hopefully that will not limit it too much?       anyways, thank you so much for you help and i know its a weird and awkward question, but i dont know where else to go and i promise i wont try to speak like this in real life  lol :P       thanks :D

20090110101536AAOcJkL	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How would you rate my story?	A Servants Tale       Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess and a plain servant girl; that’s me. Although I live in huge castle, I’m not treated like royalty. My job in the castle is to keep the princess happy, which can be very difficult sometimes. For instance, Princess Emma decided she wanted to have her own party in the ward and I was in charge of everything. Let me tell you that’s a difficult task when the hostess is a princess. The king said OK to the party but he said the guests could not leave the ward, because all other parts were off limits. But, before long all the guests started wandering off towards the keep, so I quickly try to stop them in fear they were going into the private chambers. All of a sudden though a guest informed me her brother went down to check out the dungeon. As I hurried through the castle walls were everyone lives and works I happen to look out one of the windows and see another guest trying to climb one of the wall towers. Terrified, I turn back to go outside to tell him to get down. I really needed help but all the workers were outside watching the jousting tournament and I really didn’t want to get the kings attention or I would be with out job.  As I passed the main hall I noticed another guest sitting in the king’s chair at the table for feasts. No one sits in the king’s chair with out being punished. I took care of that matter and realized I still had a few more. I somehow had to get every guest in the ward before the tournament was over. I quickly run outside and rescue a guest falling of the draw bridge and then usher everyone back inside. Once all the guests were accounted for, I heard the the trumpets signaling the tournament was over for the day. That was a really close call, but thats just one story about how difficult my job is, being a servant to the princess.

Also, I used to lie a lot as a teenager, this is when some ppl I knew would say I reminded them of him, but I don't anymore.  It took such a toll on me that I used to lie like that, that now I have a hard time telling white lies to people in fear (of lying/being hated for it.)      anyways.  why do you think somebody would say you remind them of a television character?  b/c their personality, their physical traits?  etc etc.

He made the Joker seem crazier than ever. I don't know how anyone else can come close to do a better job as Joker. But my question is about the possibilty of another movie, Who do you think the next villian will be? Since Joker was left alive do you think he can still make a cameo in the next one with new actor or should he be left out? Who do you think makes a better villian for the next movie: Riddler, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Catwomen, or 2 Face? Or even a combination of two of them? Do you think Robin will come onto the scene?

The japanese versions i'm having my penpal send me won't seem as special (but they still will! My penpal rocks :D) and also because last time they did a really shitty job of editing and proofing.  I don't know if anyone else noticed, but instead of having pics from the manga on the inbetween chapter pages they only had the logo last time they did this, and also there were a couple typos and they didn't completely cover up the japanese text in one pane (I distinctly remember this).      I'm I just finding things to complain about because I don't have the money to buy the new volumes? i think so
