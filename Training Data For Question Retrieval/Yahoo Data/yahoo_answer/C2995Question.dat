20070611005038AAeqEWC	Environment;Conservation	Semplice astio infondato o invidia o peggio ?	Due u tre giorni fa e apparso un post pieno di sciocchezze a proposito del fatto che Romma abbia i ''nasoni'' con un filo d'acqua continuo e dello spreco di acqua che si farebbe con le fontane ( le più grandi sono con pompe a ciclo chiuso), a bispetto di altre zone d'italia quali  Calabria, Siena, Sardegna   che hanno poca acqua.   Premesso che Roma è ricchissima di acqua fin dal tempo degli Antichi Romani con i suoi numerosi acquedotti, alcuni dei quali funzionanti dopo 2000 anni, perchè tutto questo astio ??? Che cosa toglie Roma a zone che sono a centinaia di chilometri di distanza o separate da mezzo Mar Tirreno ? Si tratta del solito odio verso Roma???. Non credo che Roma tolga niente a nessuno. Sfrutta riserve locali, bene.

20090131120141AAJ2jK6	Environment;Global Warming	A question for "sceptics"?	How do you explain the recent rises in global temperature?        http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warmin...     http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/     http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/pre...       We know they're not caused by the geological events (the movement of tectonic plates), because there's no new mountain ranges around, and those sort of changes take millions of years anyway.      We know it's not caused by solar events, because solar forcing has pretty well be flat for the last 20 or 30 years, while global temperatures over the same period have been rising.        http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi...     http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Climat...       And please do not give vague, unspecific answers like "it's natural" or "it's cyclical" or "climate always changes", because such statements don't really explain anything.

20090225093857AAlsb2U	Environment;Green Living	HOW do you get rid of old VHS video tapes?	I have probably 150-200 old video tapes (or VHS tapes), of old movies and old TV programs that I use to tape and now its no use with dvds and you tube around. Its just been siting out here in my room and Im just sick of having it around.      I need to get rid of it but it takes so much space just throwing it out in the bin plus I dont want to leave out on teh street as little kids from the neighbours might just make a mess by pulling the tape around these VHS.      Is there an environmentally friendly way to get rid of VHS tapes?
