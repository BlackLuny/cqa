As i woke up i were in shock and felt sick.

Hi      i've talked to that girl that i like (she never knew me before), went on 2 dates then i had to travel... we kept in touch on the phone, but then things went cold and she didnt want to carry on with that... she said that she didnt feel that spark when she first met me, and she believes we are very different and stuff... however she said she would like us to be friends, and whenever i call her she talks like it's ok and we can talk for an hour...      the thing is i couldnt really show her who i am due to these circumstances... only saw her twice, the rest was on the phone, i wasnt comfortable dealing with her because of that, and the result is that the image she got of me is distorted... and i was kind of shy, which never happened to me before with any girl...      i really want her bad, and in 2 months im going back to settle in the city where she lives... i'd like to find a way for her to re-discover me, to forget that guy she thought she knew and discover the real me... she said she couldnt have feelings for me, and that she will never have... but i believe i can change that... she also asked me to forget about her and stuff...      from the psychological point of view of women, how can i do that?      im 25 and she's 21...      also, in the process i dont want her to feel that im pushing just to take revenge or hurt her...

20090129044346AAAKmWC	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I get feelings for this girl who is the complete opposite to me?	a few years ago I used to go to this supermarket to shop when I lived with my parents... after shopping there for a while I started to develop jittery feelings for one of the check out chicks. I think she knew it... I asked her for her number and she gave it to me. We went out to coffee eventually.... but the conversation didn't go as planned... we had nothing in common whatsoever lol. I still spoke to her occasionally... but I didn't pursue her... she played so many damn mind games with me it sucked. I reversed it and played mind games with her too... noone takes advantage of the president of Russia lol :)    So anyway she left her job and I didn't see her anymore... I moved out of home and didn't shop at the supermarket where my parents lived. Now I'm back living with my parents 2 years later and now shop at the supermarket once again...    Tonight I saw her in the supermarket as a customer... I couldn't believe it. But I think she noticed me quickly and looked away after half a second (note 2 years has passed since I last saw her). Everytime I walk into the supermarket I think about where she is and what she is up to... I don't know its so stupid.. she is nothing like me at all. Anyway I tried to shop as fast as possible when I noticed her... I just wanted to get out of there because she didn't want to talk to me... which was stupid because I never left her on a bad note.... plus why wouldn't a girl dig the President of Russia? there aint no better guy than me :)    Now I leave the supermarket to quickly get a bottle of alcohol.. (not vodka lol) and guess who is behind me at the cashier. It was her.. but I chose not to say hello to her... because I walked past her enough times for her to notice me... (I wasn't 100% sure it was her) but now I know its her.    The weird thing is.. she must of left her grocery trolley within the supermarket to get some alcohol. She might of saw me walking into the liquor store outside the supermarket? is this just a coincidence?    I guess it would make sense to leave the trolley at the cashier then walk outside to the alcohol shop to buy a carton then come back and put it in the trolley...    Anyway what do you think? would she be worth saying hello to despite her not making any moves? or should I just move on? I don't have trouble getting female attention. The Presidential status does wonders.. lol I'm not Putin.. just a gimmick haha. but I still do well with women in general.    So...???

20090129050900AAAIUNO	Social Science;Psychology	I feel nervous and afraid to do anything with my life and my family doesn't understand. What can i do?	So im pretty sure that i have social anxiety disorder. I rarely leave the house and as a result my life is pretty sad.      I fear going outside and doing anything and i feel extremely nervous and anxious when i actually do have to leave the house. I'm 22 and ever since i graduated high school i rarely leave the house. Actually i missed my last final exam for English so i think i failed and haven't even graduated high school.  Also i have never had a job.      Its because of my social anxiety disorder but i haven't been diagnosed by a doctor and i haven't shared this with my family since i don't have the guts to explain this to them. I'm amazed that they have let me sit here for the last 5 years and not do anything with my life. Maybe they just don't care and have given up on me?       So what should i do in my situation im screwed at life and i have no clue what to do next.

20090129053120AAteGmS	Social Science;Economics	A question about the current world economy.?	Ok. I am intelligent and believe that this little disclaimer excuses me from asking a potentially really stupid question.      So, we know the world economy is pretty much screwed. But as each country prints it's own money, can we not come to a world agreement to have as much money as each country needs to put them back in the position they were before the markets crashed? This way, the money can be given to the citizens so governments wouldn't need to bail out banks, the automotive industry etc, redundancy wouldn't be a problem anymore as people would have the money to spend thus kickstarting the economy.      I know there will be reasons why this can't work, but what we are doing isn't really working either, is it?

I don't know if I want to go or not, but I cried begging my mom not to let me go. I've done this more than once, but I never cried until now.      Whenever we go to visit my grandma's, I try and avoid it and just tell my mom either I have homework, I'm tired or any other excuse..

I don’t usually remember my dreams, but last night I had a weird dream that I couldn’t find any answers to in my dream dictionary.        I dreamed that it was night time (around 7pm and getting later as the dream went on, for some reason that time just sticks).  I had to go to court at midnight to be on trial for murder of some guy (don’t know who), but I didn’t do it, and there was no proof that I could show to prove I didn’t.  I was facing the death penalty if I was found guilty so I was really worried and stressed because it was for something I didn’t do.  My fiancé and I were acting like it was our last night together.  I also remember we were at my parents house and it was a darker type atmosphere (not pitch dark, but not bright either).  That’s about all I could remember.  I probably should have wrote it all down right after I woke up, but I didn’t think about it until I a hour or two later when I started remembering parts.      Any ideas?

I guess I'm a bit of a fogey now, pushing 30, but this site seems awfully full of kids getting people to do their homework/ coursework for them. Would you not be concerned that the info you are getting is inaccurate? If so, do you make an effort to verify the info? If you do, why didn't you just research it yourself in the first place? Don't get me wrong i used to copy off my mates all the time, but at least i knew them/ how bright they were/ the expected quality of their work.

20090129061653AAqWXu8	Social Science;Psychology	If everything is okay, why am I not over it?	When I was younger my mother passed away and we stayed with her best friend's family when my dad had to work. I grew up with this family but was especially close to their little girl. (She was my age.)      Anyway, her dad used to molest us. Sometimes we would hide but for the most part, I protected HER by making her pretend she had other things to do and I would "take one for the team".      After several years they moved away. Our parents got into a fight and we weren't allowed to talk to each other after that.       I always felt guilty for not being there to protect her from her father.      After so many years, we reunite on Myspace and she's beautiful and wonderful.      This is what gets me: She's totally over what her dad did. She forgave him and everything. THIS makes me feel great! I'm sooo happy for her. And she let me know that she didn't need that protection from me.      So why do I still feel like something is missing? I'm not mad anymore because SHE is great. (And that was my worry.) I'm not sad because I feel that this situation made me strong.    But I still can't stop thinking about it or feeling bad for not protecting her.      What do you think?

20090129065318AAfenDQ	Social Science;Psychology	I used to draw nude woman as a kid. Is it a normal behavior for young child?	I used to draw, and I still draw every thing all the time, but now I remember that as a little kid I used to draw nude woman, now I do it in the art academy, and it's like school work, but then… is it normal for a young kid? It all started way back when I was in kinder garden, I saw a picture of a nude woman in the barber shop back room and when I came home I drew nude woman, and knew to hide it from my parents.   And in kinder garden me and few friends, used to try to look under girls skirts.   When I was a bit older, maybe on the third grade, I found a stash of adult magazines and started to draw them. And it was way before I really new what sex is and all that.   I even used to skip gym class to draw nude woman in hiding… was I a perverted kid? I mean I wasn't yet a teenager and most boys hate girls, and ever since I remember my self I liked girls, even today I have only one male friend, the rest are girls.   By the way I still draw some sexy pinups from time to time, but not in the same enthusiasm I did then.

20090129065632AAJN5lT	Social Science;Sociology	Do you feel people should be culturally offended or sensitive, or just personally?	I don't feel people should take things said about their culture personally. I feel it is only appropriate to take things personally if the said "thing" is about the person only. For example, I feel like when I'm talking to one person in Japan, I'm talking to the whole country, culturally speaking. If I somehow make fun of or compliment their culture, they take it personally as if I'm talking to all of Japan.

20090129070309AAsWYEQ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies, why is it when some WOMEN are "stressed" out, they have a tendency to put off their personal life ?	And concentrate on their issues.  Oh baby,  I wish  I could but I have   some issues I need to work out in my life.  Maybe later.  Tick tock,   tick tock.  Wow,  you must have a lot of issues my dear, no disrespect.  But it can't be all that bad, is it ?  You obviously are   dealing with something that is compromising with your well being, it   must be that serious.  Because hey,  guys like to have fun.  And   in the midst of it all, regardless of what is happening, you have   to enjoy life at some point or another.  If you keep being negative, then   it will be that much harder for you to find the solutions to your problems.  And more often than not,  most people are the cause of   their problems.  Whether they would like to admit it or not.  So my   question is this.  Why do some women who are stressed out, and   is in a state of crisis,  have a tendency to block out or put off their   personal life.  Inspiration comes from others around you,  you know.   Please find someone who can help make the journey a little bit easier.   Do you agree ?
20090129070317AAhtb4X	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is my girlfriend's behavour acceptable in Western culture?	I'm from Korea (a peninsula between Japan and China)   I'm often frustrated when I think of my girlfriend in her early twenties ( 10 years younger than me)   I usually spend my time, energy and everything with my girlfriend.   But she sets more value on her friends(whether they are men or women). Quite honestly, I don't look at any other girl but my girlfriend.   On the other hand, she often drinks alcohol in a bar with one of her male friends after midnight. And she normally talks to one of them on the phone after 1 am.   So I often complain to her about that, but she tells me not to worry about that, because she behaves carefully and only loves me.   Even if it's true, I don't like her being with them late at night.   So I wonder if she really loves me. How can she let me down like that? At first, I thought it would be a sort of generation gap, because I'm 10 years older than her.   And I also know that she used to want to play outside her home until late at night in her childhood, owing to her horrible father, an awful drunkard. This is why she relies on her friends more than her family.   But most of my friends agree with me. They don't understand my girlfriend's behaviour, even if she neither kisses her male friend nor has sex with him.   What about the Western society?   Do you normally understand her behaviour? Is it acceptable for a girl to stay with ONE of her male friends in a bar or any closed space after midnight or to talk to her male friends around 1 am?   Has my girlfriend become too westernised?   She says that she is suffocated by my excessive jealousy and interference in her privacy. But I think that my complaint is justifiable at least in Oriental society.    What do you think about that? Who do you think is wrong in the conflict between my girlfriend and me.
20090129080752AAHYTEO	Social Science;Psychology	Why do adults pride themselves in being smarter/better than younger people?  We don't really care. lol.?	I mean, I'm a young guy and I always get all of these "Adult" types to always go on their power trips, I know more than you, I wear a suit or a tie, I do this, I do that, and always go on there ego trips thinking, well, they're intellectually superior, they might hold great jobs, they might be this, that, yadda yadda yadda. I mean, did it ever occur to them, that most of us don't really care?    We have our youth, which alone guarantees us more vitality, a much better s7x life, more opportunities to be socially accepted, making networking easier, and gives our whole life ahead of us, which we can also use to grow intellectually, so basically all these bitter and dried up adults who keep trying to assert how much better they are than the young-ins,...are retarted because one day, we'll most likely be there too, it's just not our time yet, and for the mean time we're enjoying ourselves, while they're unhappy and bitter and resort to ego trips to make themselves feel better.    Ironic isn't it? How even on here, so many people pride themselves in things such as the jobs they have, or how they know alot about..well whatever,...and slamming the younger/less intelligent folks, when in all reality,..one day, those younger people might surpass them?      I mean,..that to me is just low. It's like "oh well I'm CURRENTLY better than you, so I'm going to milk that and dish it out because i can."    Why do some adults do that? it's so stupid.    It's like okay, you have a PH.D, you're this, you're that, you have how many cars,...great, you're still old, you might develop a health problem, and instead of being happy/fulfilled, you're trying to eternally grasp for more, more, more, more, which is just obsessive compulsive, so it means you have mental problems too.        I don't get this lol. It's just funny to me.

I told them that i would like to buy it, but they had to give me an an answer in 5 days time.    so i was living in one of these transient rooms, and my BF tells me that he is going back home- to TN, and i was really scared, because i'd be in NH all alone. He says he'll bring me cheap cigarettes, wine, lamb, and cheese (weird)   so since i'm alone i have to take a job at Shoney's (like Denny's) and i'm a waitress there, but i have to leave early one day and miss a $6 tip.       I woke up to a voice saying "hello"- but no one was there, it really freaked me out.

Hi ok so on here I found another person asking if a woman's sexual peak is real or not and what age. I am also 28 years old and just randomly starting to have an increased sex drive....I mean REALLY increased and I can't satisfy it no matter what I do. I used to have a high sex drive when I was 19-24 but not at all like this. Can someone explain to me what happens when you reach your sexual peak and maybe we can come up with a real answer that isn't based on an inconsistent number. People keep changing the number. First it was 30, then it was 32 so says my fiancee and now it's 30-40 or just 40. This is getting to be ridiculous. Can you not reach a sexual peak at any age? Does it have to be 40? And who says I can't have mine randomly at 28? This is so confusing. If I can figure out exactly what goes on when this happens maybe it will answer a lot of people's questions. I personally don't think you have to be a specific age. I think it varies on a woman's body because we're all different in many ways.

20090129080940AAj74p9	Social Science;Psychology	Will getting a gun permit or learning how to fight help develop a thicker skin?	Due to some conflict and threats from some females, I feel like I finally need to learn how to fight back when I need to. I'm known by everyone to not be much of a fighter, or someone who causes fights and argue. One of the females is known to be my boyfriend' s sisters and their friend. One got mad cuz I won't talk to her, but she's the one who stole $800 from me and ruined our friendship. They're harassing me, has always bullied and mistreated me becuz they know I'm not argumentative and a quiet laid back person. They sending me threats to me and my mom, which makes me mad and want to fight them.     I was thinking if I beat them up or get a gun permit for protection, will that help the situation?

20090129080224AAs60hA	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Ok, i need help interpreting a dream....?	ok, i don't really believe in this because all people look at things differently, so how can there be a universal meaning for things in dreams. but here it goes....      Ok, I dreamt I was wrestling one of my really good friends Sarah. A little information on us. We had been crushing for about 10 or 11 months, but i was with someone else the whole time. It ended with my ex and then me and Sarah decided to give this a try, this was back on sept. 12 (but i don't think the date matters). Well we broke up after a few weeks because her life was getting complicated. her parents were talking about splitting up, her friends were all revolting against each other, and with all the schoolwork she needed to get done (she has 3 AP classes and 3 Honors, the school recommends only takeing 2 AP classes because they are college level) but she felt like she was being unfair to me that we couldn't spend more time together. But w/e, we broke up, and we've kept in close contact and are really close. We actually talked about a week ago about getting back together, but that's a situation i can work out on my own.      Here's the dream, we were wrestling. We were in my school’s wrestling room (I am a Varsity wrestler) and I seem to remember a few other ppl in there, but I’m not even sure they were paying attention and at some points they weren’t even there. But it started out, Sarah was getting back points (if you don't wrestle that means, i was on my back and she had control). Then after a little moving around, I got the reversal and started to cradle her up, I didn’t want to do it hard because obviously I didn’t want to hurt her. The reversal means obviously that i reversed it and got control, and a cradle means to grab a leg and head (sometimes with an arm) and pull them together, creating what looks like a cradle. Then I remember she was on top again and we decided to break, I was on my back while she was on my chest, as we were getting up, we stopped for a second and then we kissed…      So who can help me with this, i seem other's dream interpretations, and some of you people who are good with this have given some pretty thorough explanations. help me out???      thanks

20090129073335AAaJiQ6	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What should I make of this weird dream?	I had a dream last night that I was at school and I read about a girl who was adopted and never knew it, so I became suspicious that my mother wasn't really my mother, but it didn't make any sense because I have my mothers smile and similar coloring. In the dream I ended up asking her: "Are you my mother?" and she told me "No." So I was like "Who is?" and she told me she was not my birth mother, but she is my mother. I let it be left at that for a few days, and then I pushed farther and found out that my dad was my dad, and he had an affair with a woman named Kim (who I looked just like) and out of resentment and love for my mom, when I was born, dad asked Kim and she gave me to mom and dad, and decided to tell me I was theirs. It turned out that I was the only person in the entire extended family that didn't know.      I was so sad, I swear I cried in my sleep. What should I make of this bizarre dream?

20090129075409AAEB6mC	Social Science;Psychology	Reoccurring dream: bees?	all right. so this is a long shot but so far this week i keep having reoccurring dreams about bees. here they are in detail:      first bee dream:      my family and i were coming home but my brother was upset because our cousin forgot what company he worked for and thought he was gay (side note: in reality he’s not). my brother was also sad she forgot about his service in the military so i comforted him and told him i appreciated your sacrifice for our country.      later i am a beekeeper but i manage to make a scary bee-wasp hybrid. i like them at first but one of them stings me, and they become a nuisance because there are so many of them, i can't even turn off my lights.      i go downstairs where my brother and dad are playing chess in the kitchen and tell my brother about my problem. my brother becomes the pied piper for bees and you leads them out of our house.         second bee dream:      i don't remember the details too well but the gist is, my family was trying to run away from bees that had invaded our house. my mom reassured me that she could command the bees and that we would be all right. in the car, my dad and I were waiting for my mom to take care of the bees but I got angry at my dad because he wouldn’t roll up the windows.         third bee dream:      in the ground there is an abundance of honey. it is like a deep lake. there are honey combs coating the surface. I have two rabbits and a dog and they want to get at the honey. but once they move the combs, the bees start to appear. they swarm my rabbits and dogs and I am afraid that we are going to get stung. my family manages to make it back into the house before the bees attack us. my dog  dies. in our house, the bees can’t get in through the screen door. when my dad and I draw the curtains, the bees sting the curtains and their stingers are embedded in the curtain when we draw it back.         any guesses?
20090129075507AAcFuKW	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream: what does this mean?	I rarely remember me dreams, this night it was a mixture of them.      #1. Before school - I got out of my car in the morning and this guy ( we used to like each other ) came side-by-side and interlocked hands and walked around the school and into it. Then at the end of the day he was waiting at the same bus -stop with me and we kind of talked.      It felt so good - even now I close me eyes and fantasize him gripping my hand as we make our way to school.      #2. My teacher was having a 'party' for me failing my math exam.         I am a 15 year old girl, what are these dreams supposed to mean?
20090129075843AA9WDYJ	Social Science;Psychology	Respond or ignore to a nasty, vicious email from Mom?	My husband has essentially cut all ties with his parents, whom he hasent seen in almost 5 years.  Yesterday, she sent him the most vicious and cruel email you can conjure up in your wildest imagination. (and no, I'm really not trying to be dramatic, I'm attempting to emphasis the seriousness of the email). Handwritten, it probably would have been about 3 pages. He hastily replied with a small paragraph essentially saying "I cant believe you said those things to me, I thought about addressing them but I'm too angry to even do it...lets just stop this back and forth stuff and not speak to each other."  Now that the dust has settled and he has re-read their email to him, he's wondering if he should address some of the outrageous things mentioned.  So here's my question -- is it better for my husband in the long run if he replies to the email and addresses the inconsistencies his Mom and Dad made? Or would it be better if he simply lets it go and moves on?
20090129082514AAbKlC8	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is Germain Greer just a bit dotty?	Let me start be saying I actually quite like Greer when she is on tv in Britain as she is a lot she doesn't come across as a fanatical feminist funnily enough.   However, if a middle aged man published a book about young prepubescent girls you would think he was a pedophile wouldn't you?      THE BEAUTIFUL BOY: by Germain Greer      The book generated some controversy because "society is not accustomed to seeing beauty in young males", Greer claims. Greer has described the book as "full of pictures of 'ravishing' pre-adult boys with hairless chests, wide-apart legs and slim waists". She goes on to say that, "I know that the only people who are supposed to like looking at pictures of boys are a subgroup of gay men," she wrote in London's Daily Telegraph. "Well, I'd like to reclaim for women the right to appreciate the short-lived beauty of boys, real boys, not simpering 30-year-olds with shaved chests."[5] She was criticized for these comments with some writers labeling her a paedophile.[6]      Germaine Greer responded vigorously on Andrew Denton's television talk show Enough Rope
20090129082220AAXhAcL	Social Science;Economics	Why does the Fed keep lowering interest rates?  Please read details carefully...?	I know that they have lowered the Federal Funds rate to 0-25 basis points.  Now I have heard that the Fed is buying long-term Treasury securities, basically monetizing the long-term debts of the US in order to lower long-term interest rates too.      My question really boils down to this: if you consider a simply supply and demand situation, where interest rates are the "price" of a loan, doesn't lowering interest rates create more demand and less supply?  This seems counterproductive -- the problem isn't that people don't want to borrow money, it's that the banks are unwilling to lend.  If interest rates were 8%-10% or higher, like they were under the Volker Fed, wouldn't banks be scrambling to see who could lend the most money?      On a side note, since many of the large holders of long-term Treasuries are foreign entities, doesn't monetizing that debt just give our precious dollars to foreigners without ensuring that the money will return to circulation in the American economy?  This also seems counterproductive?      Please, no political answers... If I wanted your opinion on the Democrats or the Obama administration, I would've asked this question in the Politics section.

Despite this new law.    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/obama    There is more than one way to get around this law.  Namely promoting men who are not as qualified as the woman trying to get a particular job.  I used to work for an employer who often did this.  They would promote men who didn't even have close to the education and experience that the woman who were eligible did.  Do you think they will just change tactics, and do you think it will work?
