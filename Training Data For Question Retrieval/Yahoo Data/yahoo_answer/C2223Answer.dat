You might need to check with your city to see if you need some type of permit, too.  Then you'll need barriers to block both ends of the street off, and you'll need to post signs so that drivers will know that they need to detour.<br>  <br>  You could have different stations for games like mini-basketball, a fish pond, and arts & crafts table, and a cake walk.  Our volunteer fire department has a dunking booth that they loan out, so you might want to check and see if anyone has one they will lend you.<br>  <br>  Try to get your parents involved.|`|154dzJ1Faa	I always thought it was called a "block party" because everyone on the block put it on.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_party" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_party</a>|`|qmFERaEWaa	BBQ, & Beer

B9JwxyRfaa	Robert O- The Official Card Game Banlist just came out, and being that the OCG is being handled by Konami, it's safe to say the game's still going on.<br>  <br>  Only thing that immediately comes to mind is 2 Gold Sarcophagus cards.  They're slower then ROTA, but they can search out any card in your deck.|`|QzD3rJtMaa	No need to worry about that.  There might not be a banned list anymore.  UDE has nothing to do with Yugioh anymore.  It was just announced that the Courts have ruled against UDE and forced them to discontinue their support for the game.  So if UDE is no longer supporting Yugioh, that means no more banned list and all tournaments that were temporarily cancelled have been permanently cancelled.  So don't expect a Sneak Preview this weekend.  If there is I can guarantee that there won't be many packs to buy.  This is serious though.  UDE has taken everything Yugioh related off of their website and it looks like www.metagame.com has even shutdown because of it.  Every time I go to Metagame it redirects me to UDE.  Just thought you should know.|`|1VtYZq5Caa	A card that can fix as a replacement of Reinforcement Of The Army and sends cards to the graveyard is Charge Of The Light Brigade but the only problem is that you have to use Lightsworn for that as it searches only lvl1-4 lightsworn cards from the deck to hand.

However the celebrant is responsible for the incremental cost and the new ticket may only be used by the celebrant. The 1-day Magic Your Way ticket good for 12 months (an option for certain passholders and multi-day ticket holders) may not be upgraded. <br>  <br>  <br>  Q: I purchased* a valid Passholder Pass or a Multi-Day Ticket that I will use for admission on my birthday in 2009. Is there anything else I could receive on my birthday?<br>  <br>  A: Yes, you have several options which are available for you to select once you arrive at the Park with your confirmation message, your proper valid ID, and your Passholder Pass or Multi-Day Ticket that you will use for admission on your birthday. You can choose one of the following:<br>  <br>      * A birthday FASTPASS? exchange card+ for a certain number attractions at the Theme Park you visit on your birthday; or<br>      * A birthday fun card in an amount equal to the price of a 1-day Magic Your Way base ticket* for you to use for certain purchases including select merchandise, recreation or tour experiences, or for Disney's PhotoPass? on-site services at participating locations at Walt Disney World?

R02vAa48aa	The link below will take you to the rules of "hold 'em". You have to decide whether you are going to play limit, no limit or pot limit. There are a lot of books out there with poker strategies that yuo can read but I suggest you get an account with one of the online poker sites (pokerstars, fulltilt) and start playing with the "play money". You can read until you go blind but the only way you'll really learn how to play is by really playing.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|UVUYG5jaaa	the more times you ask the same question? the odds improve someone might lie to you...including me!|`|V9XzHBZQaa	Each Player gets 2cards faced down,before this is buy in or blinds which is just to make the pot larger,then comes the first round of betting,from the remainder of the deck burn the 1 card then turn 3cards on the table this is called the flop,second round of betting then u burn 1 card and turn 1 card on the table,third round of betting then u burn 1card and turn 1 card on the table,there should be 5 cards on the table,now final round of betting, use ur 2 cards and combine with 3 cards on the table to make best possible 5 card hand.|`|I4KqAZThaa	Playing a card game by the rules is pretty easy - you learn the rules by the book, practise a few games and voila! you know how to play the game.<br>  There are plenty of sites on the net, such as the one below which can teach you exactly how to play texas hold em poker.

b8033bf8d408fe319ec07b82e0011ba6aa	yes  i do :<br>  <br>  Guild Wars takes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.<br>  You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Guild Wars, also known as Guild Wars Prophecies, is a Competitive/Cooperative Online Role-Playing Game (CORPG) created by ArenaNet, a subsidiary of the South Korean game publisher NCsoft.<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Overview <br>  2 Game Mechanics <br>  2.1 Basics <br>  2.1.1 Professions <br>  2.1.2 Skills <br>  2.1.2.1 Skill Types <br>  2.1.3 Equipment <br>  2.1.4 Builds <br>  2.1.5 Guilds <br>  2.2 PvE Specifics <br>  2.3 PvP Specifics <br>  3 Campaigns <br>  4 Story <br>  4.1 Sorrow's Furnace <br>  4.2 See also <br>  5 Critical response <br>  6 Editions <br>  7 Account Information <br>  7.1 Account Management <br>  8 Notes <br>  9 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Overview<br>  While Guild Wars is considered by many to be an MMORPG it differs in its approach compared to many of its contemporaries. In particular it provides a number of features which support casual online RPG gameplay; a low level cap, instanced game worlds outside of town areas, instant travel and subscription fee free play after purchase of the game. Guild Wars is carefully maintained by the developers to support competitive play in addition to providing an RPG environment and balancing skills and professions. To emphasize these core differences from most MMORPGs the developers have termed the game a Competitive/Cooperative Online Role-Playing Game (CORPG).<br>  <br>  Conceptually, skills (the abilities the player has available to use in game) are very important through both the RPG and competitive parts of the game. A player selects a limited number of skills (up to a maximum of eight) prior to entering a battle and needs to be careful while using those skills during a battle. An adept competitive player needs knowledge of all the game's skills and how they interwork to be most effective. Guild Wars' emphasis on skill selection and implementation of skill use has similarities with many collectible card games.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Game Mechanics<br>   <br>  This modified screenshot illustrates that certain skills can be chained together for added effect.[edit]<br>  Basics<br>  When a new Guild Wars account is created, the new player has four characters to create. A player can choose to create a character (or characters) for either of the two play styles which Guild Wars supports: Player versus player (PvP) or Player versus environment (PvE). The game mechanics for each side are the same but the play style is different for each. A player gives new characters a unique, unchangable name when they are created. The name must have two parts which might be a first and last name, or a title and a name.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Professions<br>  A Guild Wars character is composed of a primary and secondary profession. The primary profession determines the appearance, armour, lead skill set of the character and provides a specialized attribute line. For example, the elementalist receives the Energy Storage attribute line to boost his spell casting capabilites and increase his energy reserves. The secondary profession allows access to skills and non-specialized attributes only and may be changed during the PvE storyline.<br>  <br>   <br>  The six Guild Wars classes from Prophecies, in alphabetical order from left to right.There are six character classes available in Prophecies:<br>  <br>  Elementalist - Classic elemental spell casting class that uses fire, air, earth or water magic for damage and defense. <br>  Mesmer - Manipulates opponents' actions against them and causes damage and confusion through illusions. <br>  Monk - Heals and protects their allies and also smites their opponents with holy damage. <br>  Necromancer - Casts curses on their opponents, utilises corpses of the dead and sacrifices their own health for damage. <br>  Ranger - Ranged attacker utilizing bow, pets and traps. A ranger can summon spirits that affect large areas of the battlefield. <br>  Warrior - Armored melee fighter using weapon, strength and tactics to fight in the front line. <br>  [edit]<br>  Skills<br>  The player may select up to eight skills from their available pool of skills to use when they play the game. Skills are either standard or elite. Elite skills are skills which are considered to be better than average. The player may only equip one elite skill when they make their skill selection.<br>  <br>  Initially the pool of skills available to a character and the player is limited and more skills are made available through game play. There are several different methods to acquire skills:<br>  <br>  Purchase from skill trainers using skill points and gold earned during PvE based play <br>  Capture from a monster using a Signet of Capture during PvE based play <br>  Quests can be obtained during PvE based play which give skills as a reward <br>  Trade in faction points earned during PvP combat to a Priest of Balthazar <br>  Skill unlock packs can also be purchased for real-world money in the official Guild Wars shop <br>  When a skill is first acquired, through the methods described above, it is unlocked for the account of the player, making it available to all PvP characters made on the account.<br>  <br>  The effectiveness of the skills used is based on the attribute line of the skill. To improve the effectiveness of skills the player distributes a limited number of attribute points to these attribute lines. There are at maximum 200 points available to distribute. PvP characters start with all 200, but PvE characters must gain them through leveling and quests. Attributes lines can be increased from 0 to 12, at the increasing cost of 1 to 20 attribute points. Runes are available which can be used to increase the attribute lines of the primary profession.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Skill Types<br>  Attack: An enhanced melee or projectile attack. <br>  Spell: A skill that results in a one-time effect, such as damage, healing, Energy loss or gain. <br>  Enchantment Spell: A spell that causes a positive effect for a period of time (e.g., speed, increased armor, increased Energy). <br>  Hex Spell: A spell that causes a negative effect for a period of time (e.g., movement/attack speed reduction, Health or Energy degeneration). <br>  Signet: A skill that costs no Energy to use but takes time to activate and often to recharge. <br>  Preparation: A skill that enhances your attacks for the next few seconds. <br>  Trap: Creates a trap that you set and leave for your enemy to trigger. <br>  Shout: A motivational phrase that benefits you and nearby allies, or hinders nearby enemies. <br>  Stance : A posture that provides an advantage in battle, either by protecting against attacks or improving your offensive abilities (one stance at a time). <br>  Glyph: A skill that enhances the next spell you cast. <br>  Nature Ritual: Creates a spirit that emits an environmental enchantment affecting allies and foes alike. <br>  Note : there are skills that fit in none of these categories. They are simply labeled "Skill".<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Equipment<br>  There is a lot of equipment available to players.<br>  <br>  Armor is available in suits specialised for a primary profession. There are different functionalities available on different armors, such as higher armor against particular damage types, extra energy or reduced condition or hex duration. <br>  Runes are non-stackable items which are put on armor to improve primary attribute lines usually at cost of health. There are runes available that can increase health and provide some damage reduction. <br>  There are many different types of weapons. They can be used by any class however for the weapon to be most effective the player must allocate enough attribute points to meet the attribute requirements of the weapon. There are two handed weapons, such as bows and hammers, and single handed weapons, such as swords and wands which may be wielded with an off-hand, like a shield. A weapon can have modifiers applied to it, such as bow strings or staff wrappings, which improve or modify the weapons damage or give benefit to the wielder. <br>  [edit]<br>  Builds<br>  A particular combination of skills, attributes and sometimes armour and weapons is known as a build. Some builds are more effective at particular tasks than others, and so are more common than others. A build may be at an individual player level, or include all of the roles in a team to utilise skill interactions across multiple players.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Guilds<br>  As the name of the game suggests, guilds are a part of the game play. After a guild is created the leader can purchase a cape and design it for the whole guild. They may also purchase a Guild Hall, a private place where only guild members can enter. Within the Guild Hall NPC players can be purchased for convenience, for example, a storage agent, dye trader or a materials trader can be lingering in the Guild Hall. Even though a player is not required to join a guild it does add valuable gameplay through comradery. Often, joining a guild is a good way to get help from more experienced players.<br>  <br>  There are four ranks in a guild, Leader, officer, member and guests(from greatest to least). Each rank having its own abilities retaining to the guild. A Leader can kick any member or officer from the guild, change the cape/flag of the guild, promote any member to officer, and demote any officer to member. An Officer may kick any member from the guild, and promote any member to officer. An officer can also invite guests, who are allowed to visit your guild hall but are still allowed to keep membership in their own guild. Guest status is only temporary.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  PvE Specifics<br>  A PvE character is created to play through the story-driven, PvE part of the Guild Wars game. A PvE character is level 1 when it is first created with no skills or secondary profession. Experience is required to level the character, and once the maximum level, 20, has been reached experience is still gained, although skill points are awarded instead of levels. Experience can be gained by:<br>  <br>  Performing NPC quests <br>  Completing the story-driven cooperative missions <br>  Killing monsters <br>  The maximum level is 20 so the time it takes to reach the maximum level is short relative to many contemporary online RPG games. Much of the game play is designed for level 20 players.<br>  <br>  There are no specific servers which players join, outside of selecting their region at account creation. Instead the world is broken into a number of smaller instances which the players can move around in. Towns have a number of instances which can hold up to 100 player characters each. It is in the towns that players form parties to perform quests or missions. A party can consist of one to eight members, depending on location, which can be other player characters or AI driven NPC henchmen. When the party leaves the town an instance of the game world is created for the party.<br>  <br>  The game world is split into different zones. Whenever the party travels between these zones, all enemies and NPCs respawn. Most enemies use only skills available to the players, but some have specialized monster skills granting them abilities players cannot emulate. Enemies also do not have a maximum level cap, so are frequently seen with levels greater than 20. Boss enemies are named and surrounded by an aura indicating their class, for instance a boss using warrior skills has a yellow aura. Players can use Signets of Capture on boss monsters to acquire skills. This is the only way elite skills can be acquired by PvE characters.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  PvP Specifics<br>  A PvP character is created at the maximum level with access to all of the skills, runes, and upgrades which have been unlocked on the account. If the player has no skills currently unlocked they may use a pre-built character to head straight into combat.<br>  <br>  There are a number of different types of PvP available to players<br>  <br>  Random Arena is a 4 versus 4 players combat. Combatants for both team are selected randomly from a pool of waiting players. Team Arena is 4 versus 4 players like Random Arena, but teams may be built by the players prior to combat.<br>  <br>  In Guild vs. Guild (GvG) combat guild teams, consisting of 8 players, battle each other for ranking on the world-wide Guild Wars ladder. This form of PvP combat offers the most strategic combat in the game, requiring good teamwork, communication and build planning. Ladder ranking is used to determine which guilds go to organized tournaments, and there are in-game or monetary rewards for the top ranked guilds in a ladder season.<br>  <br>  Finally Hero's Ascent implements a concept called World at War, in which teams from different regions fight through several PvP arenas up to the last area called the Hall of Heroes. The regions fight for "The Favor of the Gods" . Wins are displayed in the chat box to declare who has "Favor". Holding favor unlocks access to some high level PvE content and allows avatars of gods to be summoned in PvE instances which offer blessings for a small fee.<br>  <br>  An observer mode is available which allows players to watch recent Hall of Heroes and tournament battles. Guild vs. Guild and other Heroes Ascent battles can also be viewed. Battles in the Hall of Heroes are "displayed" every four minutes with a fifteen minute delay(as to not allow exploits). Other Observer Mode battles have to have a rank 1-100 guild in the match inorder to be viewed.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Campaigns<br>  Unlike many contemporary online games players can get access to the Guild Wars servers without a monthly fee. The developers have instead opted for an episodic structure which involves regular releases of campaigns at the rate of about two every year. Unlike "expansion packs", these campaigns are stand-alone games that may be played individually or combined with other campaigns. Players may thus pick and choose the campaigns they wish to participate in.<br>  <br>  Two campaigns have been released: the original, Guild Wars Prophecies, followed by Guild Wars Factions. The third campaign, Guild Wars Nightfall, is currently in development, with a world preview scheduled from September 22-24, 2006, and worldwide release on October 27.<br>  <br>  In addition to the campaign-specific content, there is an amount of core content shared between all campaigns. This core content includes;<br>  <br>  Core professions: the professions of the Prophecies campaign with around 50% of their skills designated as "core skills". <br>  The Battle Isles - a PvP-specific map area that contains the major PvP arenas, the guild halls for guild versus guild matches, and a PvP training area. <br>  Fissure of Woe and Underworld - elite PvE areas which are available to players if their region has the Favor of the Gods and their character has completed the relevant rite of passage. <br>  Players who do not purchase a specific campaign will not get access to the PvE portion of that campaign, nor be able to use the skills and professions specific to that campaign. They may still interact with other players who have purchased that campaign, including trading with them for items specific to the campaigns they haven't purchased.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Story<br>  Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.<br>  Ascalon is at war, fighting the Charr invading from the North. The fight is not going well but the Great Northern Wall protects Ascalon from the worst of the threat. However, the Charr find a way past the wall, and increase their attacks. It is in this setting the player begins a new character and completes initial training quests.<br>  <br>  The Wall is unable to protect Ascalon forever. The Charr are able to use a powerful ritual which calls fire and crystal meteors from the sky, known as "The Searing", destroying the Wall and turning Ascalon into a wasteland.<br>  <br>  In 'post-Searing' Ascalon, Prince Rurik and his father King Adelbern, the leaders of Ascalon, fight a losing battle against continued assaults from the Charr. As the players fight through the wasteland helping where they can, they find the legendary horn Stormcaller, which is said to hold immense power against invaders of Ascalon. Rurik is able to use Stormcaller to weaken the invading Charr and push them out of the capital, Rin. Rurik and Adelbern argue about the next move. Adelbern wants to fight off the Charr but Rurik, after seeing Rin's devastation, wants the people of Ascalon to flee to the safety of Kryta. For this traitorous sentiment the King exiles his son from Ascalon.<br>  <br>  Rurik and his supporters leave Ascalon behind and travel to Kryta through the Northern Shiverpeak mountains. This is not an easy journey as they are impeded by the Stone Summit Dwarves who try to stop their passage. The Deldrimor Dwarves aid Rurik and the refugees through the mountains. The passage comes at a price as Rurik dies at the hands of the Stone Summit trying to ensure the safety of the refugees. The party must continue on to Kryta without him.<br>  <br>  Kryta is the domain of a relatively new religious group called the White Mantle. After completing some tasks for the Mantle the players become trusted members of the group and are requested to find and escort the magical "Chosen" so the Mantle can instruct them. While the White Mantle are escorting the "Chosen" through the Maguuma Jungle they are intercepted by a rebel group known as the Shining Blade. The White Mantle escorts are killed and the "Chosen" are abducted by the Shining Blade.<br>  <br>  The party pursues the Shining Blade deeper into the Jungle. After catching up to them, Evennia, the leader of the Shining Blade, reveals the real purpose of the "Chosen" - to be a sacrifice. The players witness this truth for themselves. Betrayed, the players attack and kill Justicar Habilion, a prominent member of the White Mantle.<br>  <br>  With the assistance of the players the Shining Blade pick up their activities against the White Mantle taking the powerful Scepter of Orr from them. Taking this Scepter to Vizier Khilbron, a knowledgable magician helping the Shining Blade, it is discovered that the Shining Blade have been betrayed and are being routed by the stronger White Mantle. The players flee with the Vizier to the Crystal Desert.<br>  <br>  The Vizier suggests that the players complete Ascension, believing that it will make the players strong enough to fight the White Mantle's "unseen gods". Once ascended the players approach the dragon prophet, Glint. Glint reveals her knowledge of the "Flameseeker Prophecies" which the players are fullfilling. She sends the players to the Southern Shiverpeaks to face the White Mantle and rescue what remains of the now broken Shining Blade.<br>  <br>  The players find that the Southern Shiverpeaks are overrun with White Mantle and their "unseen gods" - the Mursaat. Both races of Dwarves are struggling with this incursion. The Deldrimor Dwarves assist the player in rescuing the remains of the Shining Blade - but at the same time the Stone Summit Dwarves have taken the Deldrimor capital, Thunderhead Keep. The players help take back the keep and hold it against the Mursaat and White Mantle invaders. The Vizier appears and tells the players they need to travel to the Ring of Fire Islands to activate a powerful weapon which will destroy the Mursaat.<br>  <br>  The players fight through the Mursaat into their fortress and free the seals on the Door of Komalie, which they believe will give access to the weapon. Instead players are betrayed when they discover that the Vizier is a Lich using the players to get the Scepter and free terrible creatures known as Titans both of which he wants to use to wrest control over Tyria. The players confront and defeat the Lich, closing the doors they had previously opened.<br>  <br>  The Lich is defeated but the Titans still roam Tyria. Glint instructs the players to defend each of the regions of Tyria against the Titan attacks, and finally eliminate the source of the Titan assaults.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Sorrow's Furnace<br>  The player returns to the Southern Shiverpeaks to assist the Deldrimor Dwarves against the Stone Summit Dwarves. The players enter Sorrow's Furnace on rescue and reconnaisance missions before entering the Furnace a final time to destroy the Stone Summit's Iron Forgeman. This is also where most of the unique items drop in the Prophecies Campaign.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  See also<br>  List of Guild Wars characters <br>  [edit]<br>  Critical response<br>  Guild Wars has been well received by critics and players alike. In 2005, it won several prestigious awards including IGN's Best PC RPG[1] and Gamespy's MMORPG of the Year[2] awards. In 2006 Computer Games Magazine listed Guild Wars as #4 in their Best Game collection, giving it in addition the Best MMO Debut and Best Technology awards.[citation needed] Guild Wars has been listed in every major Editors' Choice category in both print and online publications. In June 2006 ArenaNet announced that they had sold 2 million copies of Guild Wars and Guild Wars Factions.[3]<br>  <br>  Published criticism of Guild Wars has centered around the following key elements. First, that the number and placement of creatures encountered in the PvE world can be overwhelming, especially since the party size and number of skills are both limited to eight. There is also a related problem of repetitiveness, as noted by IGN: "As fun as combat is, and as pretty as it looks, plowing your way through low-level mobs can and will get tiresome, since they don't give much (if any) experience points and will be dropping items that are virtually useless to you."[4]<br>  <br>  Secondly, several reviews have cited the lack of a sophisticated in-game trading system such as auction houses as exist in other MMORPGs, so the only way for players to sell items is to advertise on a trade channel that is shared by all players in the same map (but may be muted by individual players). A related problem is the difficulty of forming parties as the level of a player is only displayed on the player avatars. The common way to form groups is to advertise in the local chat channel. The combination of grouping and spam messages can overwhelm all other communication. Reviews such as the one by IGN have commented that itemization in the game lacks variety because the only way to distinguish suits of armor is by dying them different colors.[4]<br>  <br>  Thirdly, both players and published reviews have commented on the unnatural coupling of cooperative and competitive matches, which require very different playing styles. At the games release, PvP characters were required to "unlock" their skills and items by playing through the cooperative game, even though a PvP player may have no interest in cooperative gaming. This issue, however, has been addressed by ArenaNet, firstly by introducing Balthazar Faction in June 2005 which enabled unlocking through playing PvP[5] and further in August 2006 by making skill unlocks for the individual professions of the Prophecies campaign available in the game's online store. Unlocks for the professions of the Factions campaign are said to follow after the release of the next campaign in October 2006[6].<br>  <br>  In addition to published reviews, there are a number of standard player complaints that are voiced in the various Guild Wars-related fansites. One common complaint is about the continual modifications to skills and items in the game. While ArenaNet claims that these changes are motivated by a desire to fix unbalanced or incorrect behavior, players often see this as nerfing popular combinations. Players also complain that these modifications are often done with no warning, or not done promptly after a fault is discovered. However, it should be noted that many players also accept such changes favourably, as they are perceived as a way to keep gameplay fresh, their complains then being that such updates are not nearly frequent enough.|`|7e34c9da95e7899b9d0bfc2c0ae70553aa	Im no fan of MMO's... sorry.

I was in a similiar situation once.  I went to a wise man on the top of one of the Rocky Mountains and this is what he told me...worked for me: <br>  <br>  First of all, you need to rub chicken seasoning all over your body, save were you were bitten.  Then, go into a hot tub that has been occupied by goldfish for 3 hours, no more, no less.  Stay in the hottub for 1 1/2 hours exactly.  Make sure to rub your nose the ENTIRE time.  Once you have gotten out of the hottub, burn your clothes.  All of them.  You have dirtied them.  Be patient, your almost done.  You must next run down the road of a major highway in a big city wherever you are - buck naked of everything except for a new thong (or bananan hammock in your case).  Once you get arrested, grab your arresting officer (male or female) and make out with him/her until your beaten to the ground and cuffed.  Once you are out of jail, the process is complete.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|a551427c9095eeef13e7a2682947fc16aa	You have 3 days to drink a cure disease potion, after that you have to do a long quest.

51df42f724106d93e7e38b78ec146dd8aa	Sin's overdrive form (which is Braska) is the hardest thing on FFX. Try leveling up A LOT. I did this until my characters had 9999 HP and they could do 9999 damage. TRy using the followint tactic. Get Anima or the Magus sisters as they do loads of damage. What i ended up doing was getting all the aeons and then leveling up in the Omega Ruins. The Omega ruins is a great trainng spot that is wise for a player that can easily kill the fiends at Zanarkand. Coordiantes for Omega ruins are: X:74 Y:36. Beware as this dungeon contains The Ultima Weapon and the Omega Weapon bosses which are also hard. Try equipping things that break HP limit or the Damage limit. Equip an accesory to Yuna that has break HP limit and she can be a very wise asset. She can be VERY usefull once she has 12,000 HP as she can heal your allies fast. Use the following team: Tidus, Auron, and Yuna. Hope you defeat him and good luck!|`|67b070a42bc6b78fecf3b1d5aa381a86aa	Have you got Anima or the Magus Sisters?

You can use a rotary cutter and template to cut out six identical triangles.  Sew 3 of the triangles together (NOTE, if you are not using a triangle template that has blunted points, do not sew point to point, use make a mark a 1/4" from each end-do not sew in that area.  Once joined to the other triangle, you will snip this part off to help eliminate the bulk).  Next, sew the remaining 3 triangles together remembering not to sew to the point.  Continuing, steam each seam and press.  Further, join the two sets of triangles together and steam block.  Finally, you will need to add the corner triangles, the size you cut these depends on the size of triangles that you use.  <br>  <br>  I will give you a link to specific dimensions:<br>  <a href="http://mccallsquilting.com/qb/pattern_905/" rel="nofollow">http://mccallsquilting.com/qb/pattern_90...</a>|`|1f98483c8379cefb4835d42011d464c5aa	Here ya go <a href="http://www.quilterbydesign.com/lessons/kaleidoscope/kaleidoscope.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quilterbydesign.com/lessons/k...</a>|`|8fc0f29e5f684e0f05232b5edaa74fb6aa	My daughter quilts but she isnt home.

Most fast bowlers over a period of time settle down to fast medium or medium pace in order to have more control on their line and length and also to extend their playing career. The run up, action and follow through are the same for fast medium or medium pace bowling. <br>  <br>  Outswing: <br>  To bowl the out swinger, the ball is held with the index and middle finger on the seam, which is upright & angled towards the slips with the shiny surface on the right. <br>  <br>  The thumb is directly underneath. Try to get as close as possible to the stumps when you bowl the Outswinger, as it is most effective then. <br>  <br>  The wrist is ****** and when the ball is released the seam must be vertical and goes down the pitch upright. The two fingers stay behind the seam as long as possible. <br>  <br>  The ball is directed at a spot on the good length of the batsman in line with the off stump. The side on action is most conducive to bowl the outswinger though front on bowlers too, with judicious use of the seam and shine, can bowl outswingers quite consistently. <br>  <br>  The aim must be to send the ball as straight as possible to the batsman and then at the last moment have it swing away late to catch the edge. Try to make the batsman play forward every time you bowl the outswinger. It can also be bowled going slightly wide of the stumps to confuse the batsman. The front arm finishes by the side of the body. <br>  Video :<br>  <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/INTERACTIVE/COACHING/BOWLING/OUTSWING.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cricinfo.com/db/INTERACTIVE/C...</a>

RcOuxDj4aa	I disapprove of Bratz dolls for children. I'm a 27yr old doll collector. I own a couple Bratz dolls myself. <br>  <br>  Their clothes are trashy at best, sporting mini-skirts, low rider jeans, belly shirts, etc. Outfits like these are really inappropriate for young girls. Yes, children are growing up really fast these days, and giving them Bratz dolls isn't the cause, but I don't think people should approve or encourage it with sexy fashion dolls.<br>  <br>  All the dolls emphasize is fashion, make-up, and boys. Like someone else said, it's celebrating a Paris Hilton-esque lifestyle, and most educated people agree that Paris Hilton is the last person anyone should look to as a role model. I think if they toned down their clothing and came out with professions or dolls promoting education, there wouldn't be any problem with the dolls.<br>  <br>  Feel free to use my opinion of you like.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	I work for Argos, which as you may know sells, amongst other things, toys.<br>  Bratz are a big seller for us. The ones that come with make up and hair stuff are really popular, and while making general chit chat with customers who are buying them they often say thier little girls are now "mad about fashion". It doesn't seem to bother most people, in fact a lot think its quite "cute".I have found it a little disturbing though, especially when you hand the toy over the counter to a girl of primary school age and hear her comment on the shade of lip gloss that comes with it.<br>  I don't know about sexualising children, but I definately think they are plunging little girls into a world of worrying about self image that kids don't naturally care about.<br>  <br>  Hope thats helped, you can quote me if I said anything worth while!|`|q3yL0Gruaa	I have a Bratz, I like to play with them!

If parents buy these for young children then to me it's very wrong.<br>  <br>  On the question of sexualising and exploiting I feel that it's generally up to the parents if they buy the Bratz or playboy stuff, you don't have to you can tell the child no, no matter how much they want it. I think kids grow up fast enough these days without having grown up dolls, i think they were orginally aimed at the so called 'tweenager' group of 9-13 year olds, but some consider there kids too old at 9 so they are bought for younger children.|`|a14b96b25b5bf9293d533f13874f2a6aaa	I hate Bratz. They are too sexy with their made up faces and puffy lips. I thought Barbie was bad until I saw the Bratz. The only thing positive I can say about the Bratz is that there is more than one boy doll. Bratz seem ot be modelled after a Paris Hilton type. <br>  I would like to see someone make a teenage doll the size of Barbies and Bratz that are more clean cut looking and not skinny, skinny, maybe more healthy looking. Maybe wearing stuff like Gap clothes and Abercrombie and Hollister...follow the real trends. <br>  They could carry books for school, have sports outfits, maybe drive Hondas and Toyotas, etc.|`|fznvQptlaa	i think bratz focus too much on sex appeal which is absurd because they appeal to kids who have no business thinking about sex.... a very slutty looking doll... quote me|`|j6jmzHSvaa	I think the Bratz are putting too much emphasis on beauty and stuff ... but it's the same as Barbies..

SRf82Bswaa	er xbox 1 or xbox 360 well if 360 there is a switch on  the back of 1 of the leads make sure it switched to tv and not to hd and if xbox 1 make sure it the right av channel is selected|`|b17qQ2W7aa	okay.<br>  try to toggle around with the video plug that goes into the cords. Mine sometimes does that and you just have to fiddle around with it. Try nudging the cable.<br>  or better yet is the video cable even in? (yellow, red, white)<br>  what ever you do don't put in the blue,green and forgot the other colour cords. coz their for HD tvs. so just make sure that the red, white and yellow ones are plugged in and have a bit of a fiddle with them. <br>  If the problem continues try hooking it up to a different tv<br>  if you only have one. Time to buy a new one<br>  also make sure it's on the right a.v channel and there is also a switch on the back of one of the cables that has T.V or H.D make sure it's on tv. then try.

That being the case you should just be able to rename the file changing .txt to .wtf,.<br>  <br>  For you to do this however you will need to have file extensions showing in your windows options.
D2ooLPb6aa	Well if you like Role playing games(RPG) i would go for Oblivion, But if you like war and just shooting everthing comeing your way go for gears, Ive played them Both and they are both good games.

Up to you!|`|22dedbfeb5954c5f4ce2b42003ebeaeeaa	I would have to go with Gears of War.  I played oblivion pretty hard core for a while, but after hitting level 13 I just got sick of it.

kNGMVXBLaa	There no name for him.. weird huh? He's just Prince of Persia<br>  <br>  POP 2008 = Prince of Persia 2008<br>  <br>  Here the original trilogy storyline :<br>  One day, the Sultan of Persia went to wage war in a foreign land and his vizier, Jaffar, is left to rule in his stead. Jaffar locks the nameless protagonist up because the Princess, Jaffar's love interest, has taken an interest in him. Jaffar then locks up the Princess herself, giving her an ultimatum; marry Jaffar, or die within an hour. The nameless protagonist escapes his prison, and climbs to the top of the tower, to where the Princess is imprisoned, facing a variety of resistance along the way. The Princess' room is guarded by Jaffar, whom the Prince defeats, saving Persia, and rescuing the Princess.|`|1qUokeKOaa	no1 has ever called his name in the first they wud just yell prince|`|M3xTT1bUaa	I believe his name isn't said.

Ml9kaf3maa	para mi  el mejor es SILENT HILL  por que trata temas  como el miedo hasta sus  extremos de lo real  y la locura de estar solo en un pueblo lleno de criaturas  a tu asecho sin contar  los sentimientos de amor   que se materialisan en todas las partes de la saga , se podría mencionar que silent hill  atenta contra lo lógico y  desafía al entendimiento  con escenas trastornadas  a las cuales no se les puede en contra entendimiento. Un ejemplo es la escena del vídeo inicial del SILENT HILL 3 en el que aparecen  dos pares de piernas con una especie de polleras roja, las piernas dan una sensacion de que estuvieran tiritando y  en  la parte inferior de la abitacion de parte superior de un torso de una persona moviendo su cabesa a una velocidad  indescriptible y tratando de alcansar con sus brasos en mal estado las piernas ( aun trato de  entender esa imagen, ,jeje) sin contar que en todas la saga los mounstros dan la sensasion de que estuvieran perdidos y atormentados como si sufrieran eternamente atrapados en este infierno, y no como en el RESIDENT  EVIL que aparecen esos zombis que caminan a dos por hora y que lo unico que se hace en el resident es disparar a mansalva. para mi un punto para el SILENT HILL|`|9oMBENcgaa	Excelente tu pregunta esta difícil los dos son muy buenos pero...mmmm Creo que Silent Hill tiene mas suspenso no sabes a que hora te van a salir los ca...nijos. en cambio Resident Evil ya estas preparado para cuando salen.

El el miedo y ademas esta mas dificil Los Acertijos son mas complejos.<br>  En el que tengo la perte de el piano que tenia que encontrar una cancion tarde tanto que preferi buscarlo en internet jeje pierde el chiste pero bueno.<br>  ademas el resident es mas comercial bueno asi lo sieto<br>  La musica de silent da mas miedo.<br>  los moutros No son tan faciles de matar Como que lo de Resident Parecen de los patitos que les disparbas en el supernintendo jej<br>  <br>  Y como pelicula ni una da miedo. Pero esta mas chida silent por la historia|`|1FZN8FKmaa	Resident evil 4|`|HYgTUzpDaa	Silent hill mejor k resident evil|`|PLySSKqEaa	Silent hill.<br>  El 1 por que el simple echo de jugarlo a obscuras y subir el volumen entrabas en ambiente.<br>  Si se sentia la adrenalina y no sabias a que hora te saldria un cabr.on.<br>  Encambi resident era muy predecible.|`|SeqfceBcaa	Me gusto mas Resident Evil!!<br>  <br>  o habia el Alone in the dark, tambien muy bueno|`|ce478f97f830552e922172b069a3fc06aa	Silent HilL sin lugar a dudas<br>  <br>   Juegos<br>  SH1 es muy bueno e innovador, la historia es estupenda, el ambiente, el terror, la niebla con criaturas andando por ahí, acompa?ados de Harry Mason en busca de su hija Cheryl y acompa?ado de Cybil es una locura en el pueblo maldito Silent HilL <br>  <br>  SH2 con James Sunderland en busca de su esposa Mary que ya fallecio acompa?ado de Maria en el pueblo de Silent HilL tiene una historia muy buena, si no es que la mejor, el ambiente sigue siendo el mismo y sigue causando la misma angustia y sensacion de miedo jejeje<br>  <br>  SH3 nos remonta al SH1 por el hecho de que Heather es hija de Harry Mason, nos muestra mas historia de Silent HilL conservando el miedo y mas criaturas de pesadilla<br>  <br>  SH4 con Henry Thownshend tiene mas acción, y mas muertes de personajes secundarios todos mueren!!! jejejeje dependiendo del final que logres Henry tmb, incluye  espiritus malignos, y muchos personajes secundarios.<br>  <br>  todo esto junto con la musica de Akira Yamaoka raya durisimo<br>  <br>  y pues Resident Evil me gusta tmb pero bajo Silent HilL, aunque me gusto mucho el Resident Evil 3 Nemesis y de las peliculas ni una me dio miedo|`|frH20PBtaa	Silent hill, dios que miedo, en varias ocasiones casi me da un infarto, pero Resident Evil 3, cuando te aparece Nemesis de la nada, o por dior!!!! juro q me cage en los pantalones|`|jSW62SLdaa	resident evil|`|jVxOOUfZaa	awebo k resident evil esta bn perro <br>  MATAZON de zombies yea<br>  siempre sera el mejor

XPW18oQBaa	its quite hard to decide for me, the ps3 is a powerful system but not too many good games out, but it also doubles as a blue-ray player and at $600 thats a bargain, i think most blue ray players by themselves are at least $1000(correct me if i'm wrong). the 360 on the other hand has the most games out and a few of them are quite good (GoW, Halo 3 when it comes out just to name 2). i would prefer a 360 because of the amount and variety of the games already out.|`|38PRiO7Taa	Xbox 360.... my reason is only bc of Halo 3, can't wait|`|AA10188900	The 360 based on lots of peoples opinions.|`|QZH5Qlhdaa	ps3|`|0bhvKMZLaa	xbox 360|`|GXAv5auYaa	PS3.

My name is Rick and I work for club penguin. My son Anthony loves that site so I gave him an account that had 50,000 coins on it along with the whole furniture catalogue for his birthday. He was so happy and is still using the account today. His account name is Coolboy60109 so if you see him say hi. Anyway, every club penguin worker gets about hundreds of accounts like the one Anthony has. I was thinking about selling the accounts on my website but then I decided instead to give them away. So anyway, the accounts that I am giving away have 50,000 coins and the whole furniture catalogue. So here are some requirements that you must have for this cheat for the accounts to work: MUST BE A MEMBER, must have at least 1,000 coins, must be over 30 days old, and must have one puffle. So send your account name and password to my email, clubpenguin930@yahoo.com, and your account with all the coins and stuff will be ready 6 hours after I receive your email.<br>  Good Luck and ENJOY!!<br>  -Rick|`|Wvbpa1DMaa	you can get the bracelet in the library, the book of rockhopper.it is at the end of the book.|`|ncaGX2feaa	to to coffe shop the go upstairs and read somthing about rockhopper and u dont have to read it just turn to the back and click the bracelet|`|smKmVCaFaa	The rainbow bracelet is in the end of a book in the Book Room.

BWe1AVXKaa	slightly sooner, even tho they mite of rushed cod5 and it wasnt great, but it wasnt too bad and most people ive talked to just dont like the guns and the fact that its world war. so modern warfare should be great but its because people keep comparing it to cod4 which was great but i dont want to be waiting so long for the next one,|`|FiynePdfaa	i think it should be sooner.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	No, definately NOT sooner... Treyarch pushed out CoD5 and look how crappy it is!  They rushed beta, and released the game in beta state with no intentions of fixing it.  Had the CoD community not gotten all bent out of shape and not threatened them with blackouts and such, they wouldn't have patched it at all.  There is currently no gaming leagues touching it on PC because of the missing /record function, yet another FAIL on Treyarchs part.<br>  <br>  Infinity Ward, who brought us CoD4 is full aware of the issues with the previous release and I'm sure they won't let us down, but there is NO need to rush a game and then see everyone get all bent out of shape.|`|xVMQx7dtaa	George doestn't know what he is talking about:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.play.com/Games/PlayStation3/4-/8771812/Call-Of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2/Product.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.play.com/Games/PlayStation3/4...</a><br>  <br>  I think they might know a little more about what the game will be called!|`|A5mgh8G2aa	it wont be moredern warfare 2 from what ive heard its based on futuristic combat|`|Ymjd99xEaa	it should be and its 21/11/09 btw sadly longer..|`|38b2bd61f1d01dc15bb99e884fe037f5aa	wouldnt that be january 11, 2010(1/11/10) not 13/11/09

l6lh6fT8aa	Absolutely Grixis Slavedriver is worth looking into. Shambling Remains is also a great Grixis creature. Hellspark Elemental could also be worth the slots, if your deck is the aggressive type. <br>  <br>  Dark Temper can serve as very good removal, as well. Kederekt Parasite can punish opponents drawing a lot of cards (and it works well with Spiteful Visions).

eBlNLuf5aa	I dont really recomend using a legendary team. Only two of those pokemon can be used in battle tower which is quite retarded. (no offense) I quite like the idea of you using Giratina. Palkia and Dialga are quite common in most d/p parties so that's ok i guess. Kyogre is a very good Pokemon and is extremely useful. I recomend you teach kyogre water spout (trademark move), thunder (100 accuracy when its raining and something you can use to knock out some strong water types like lapras, milotic, wailord), earthquake to protect you against electric types and lastly ice beam against grass types. Groudon is ..ok i guess... it's not as useful as kyogre but still strong. Salamence is very commonly found in parties. It's stats are pretty high but not well-balanced. I recomend dragonite. <br>  <br>  Your party needs more variety. You have far too many dragons which makes you vunerable. Ice beam, earthquake and dragon claw are quite popular moves so you will have to watch out for those. Sorry. I'm afraid this party is pretty mediocre so l'll give you a 5/10  sorry :(|`|CHgTqcqZaa	average train all up to level 70 at least|`|JWu0BgGYaa	Although legends are cool the often arent even that good when it comes to firepower eg Dialga and Girintina! Alot better to train up no legends to high levels. But hey its cool youve come across so many legends! Im still trying to get my hands on Kyogre and Groudon for my pearl game.|`|Q0RPmlSfaa	Crap.<br>  Obviously you cant train for **** or you're a noob to use an entire legendary team.<br>  Pathetic.|`|si1YTQhyaa	It's a pretty n00by team sry, all legends and a Salamence?<br>  Ya man u gotta get a better team :).|`|crspNObZaa	its ok, not much good if you want to to event battles, generally they dont allow any legendaries, i would definetly raise them to 70 + tho.

epJSFOENaa	I just bought Brain Age 2 about a month ago and I am hooked on it.  The challenges are actually fun and challenging, and admittedly I do feel a bit more alert after training!  The Suduko game is addictive, too.<br>   <br>    There is also a game called "Trauma Center: Under the Knife", that's a pretty engaging simulation where you play a doctor performing surgery.  It's a bit tougher, but once you acquaint yourself with the DS, it is a great buy.|`|4SDqRs6Laa	I have brain age and brain age 2. I love brain age 2! I think there tasks are more fun. And there is a"virus" game that you can unlock (where 3 or more colors will pop and clear?) I'm super curious about brain academy though... I think i'll get it next week :P|`|AKaxLa2Qaa	those games are all well and good but brain age you get bored with very fast. unless you like doing arithmetic problems. it also has sudoku puzzles but you might as well buy a sudoku game for that. big brain academy is fun but it also gets boring fast and was the first game i traded in. my advice.......get Wario Ware Touched. its a little wierd but its fast paced puzzle solving. <br>  <br>  in the game you use the stylus to solve microgames. microgames are 3 to 5 second long games where you do something simple very fast. its actually challenging. the purpose is for you to think fast and solve as many as you can with four lives. the microgames use all of the fun parts of the DS from the stylus to the microphone. i still have yet to be bored with this game. it is my favorite one actually. there are about 140 microgames and it attacks your thinking skills more than you would think. <br>  <br>  you may have to hunt to find it because it is not too common in stores. you definitely cant get it in target. i found mine at a game stop after looking at about 3 other local game stops. but it is my favorite DS game to date.

25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	My favorite wrestlers are The Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan, and Rob Van Dam. (RVD)You may not know these wrestlers because they don't wrestle anymore.

7ec9d10ac92363682041cb9f0c0ee42daa	Nope... The only thing that effects loading performance is the amount of custom content you have in the game.  I have deleted a neighborhood(Veronaville) and everything runs just fine.  The deleted one will not be in you neighborhood list anymore when you start the game so don't worry.|`|9d50e6d6bb553c87af87c8b5d500c61aaa	I would imagen the game as a whole would load faster. but i dont think it will affect game speed or graphics. The only thing that affects graphics and game speed would be a change in ram or a graphics card.<br>  <br>  good luck
3a1d8698de7374f2b6653413be8c6dbfaa	It's totally okay. I'm 21 and beat the game a few years ago. I felt like such a dope because I was 17 or 18 and cried at the end of a video game! My best friend and I played it together and both of us were crying at the end. It's an awesome game and very touching and extremely real feeling. It's still my favorite game.<br>  <br>  I even went so far as to order off ebay some cheap dvds that were made up of all the cutscenes for both FFX adn X2. I wouldn't have done it if they cost a lot but since they were cheap and I love watching the ending and certain scenes I decided to do it.<br>  <br>  And don't worry, your young, you'll find that love. I got lucky and did and I spent all of my school years completely alone. So don't worry, when it's time for you to find them, you will.<br>  <br>  In the meantime keep dreaming and playing. Who knows, maybe that love for the game and dreaming of being Yuna will help you become a designer of some sort (games, writer, etc)!|`|75bfab7a5286ae9d8f3db1048a4891a1aa	There is no secret ending in this game.  FFX-2, the sequel, has the alternate endings.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there is nothing wrong with getting emotionally attached to the games.  That is why they write the stories.  I can pick out my favorite scene from several Final Fantasy games, because they left a lasting impression.  The stories are amazing.  Square-Enix does a great job of making us sympathize with the characters, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  So, crying at the ending of the game isn't a bad thing.  If anything, it is a compliment to Square-Enix.  You prove that they are writing good stories in their games.  (Currently, my favorite ending is FF 9.  Check that one out sometime.)<br>  <br>  Happy gaming!|`|a85b81b1da66924cab49695b0d0972e1aa	I finished the game when I was ten and I didn't cry. I beat Penance, the dark aeons and Nemesis. It's just a video game. I'm sure that there is no alternate ending. If you want cheering up, buy FFX-2 but you need to get 100% to get the happy ending. Good Luck!|`|e7881c8de7d3a94175f10d95a6ec7cb5aa	Not at all...<br>  <br>  It's a beautiful game, and the sign of a good game-maker if it evokes such powerful emotions in you.  Just means they did a good job.<br>  <br>  When I watched Titanic in the theatre... oh, ten years or so ago, I remember people bawling all over the place.  It's no different, really.<br>  <br>  I got a little teary-eyed myself at the end of FFX, and I'm a full ten years older than you.  I had well over 80 hours in the game at that point, and when you devote that much of your time to something, of course you're going to feel emotionally attached to the characters.  It's no different than a heart-wrenching book or movie.<br>  <br>  At any rate... you'll like the perfect ending to FFX-2.  I don't want to spoil anything for you, but it by all means makes up for the depressing FFX ending.  I'd be happy to give you a link to a site where you can watch it, but like I said, I don't want to spoil it.<br>  <br>  If you really want to watch it, go to YouTube and search for FFX-2 Perfect Ending.|`|87fed2be4e234dd87e8b54034d7fc834aa	keep trying. there's a secret ending for perfect scores. goodluck|`|eceb3733dac41acb2209ee932703be3eaa	What a great game that was. I especially enjoyed the wedding scene in the game. RPG games are known very well for people getting emotionally involved and attached to the characters, you do spend loads of hours playing the game with same people and after a while you tend to pick your best and ones you adapt to. The ending is great and well worth the wait of all them hours you put into the game. Ahh, the memories of that game. Good times.|`|AA10580726	Hey,<br>  <br>  It's okay to be emotionally moved by things.  Especially things that touch on parts of your life - like your desire to be loved like that.  We live in a world where people mock others for believing in anything and feeling about anything.  Don't be dragged down by the people in the world who have lost all faith, love, or hope in anything and everyone.<br>  <br>  This is a sign that you are set apart from "normal" people in that you are willing to believe in yourself, and your emotions more than the opinions and bs of the comformists.<br>  <br>  Congratulations.  You are an independent thinker.
rkB9kVSdaa	There are countless ways to earn kinzcash in webkinz world.<br>  The most important is to always do the daily/hourly events in "today's activities", these include wishing well, wheel of wow, gem hunt, etc. You can also do a job at the employment office...if you do a job & you like it/are good at it, stick with that job! You will level up and you'll be able to earn more kinzcash. Sell items you don't want. Be careful when spending your cash. Don't buy toys your pets cannot play with or board games you can simply play in the tournament arena. Don't buy items from the curio shop that you can simply buy in the W-Shop!!! Yes, Arte sometimes has sales but most of the time items are overpriced. He also sells rare items, but don't buy them unless you're collecting and you know for sure that they are rare and not in the W shop. To save money on food, start a garden. You only have to pay for seeds once, and you keep growing food, and webkinz LOVE home grown food. Do your daily kinzcare every single day. It gives you free kinzcash, food, and a chance to win an exclusive item. "The Best Games" really depend on what you're good at and enjoy doing. Some good & easy arcade games are candy bash 2 and cash cow. Try out different games to find out what you're good at and play that game often to improve your skill. Play the game of the day so you can get bonus cash. The tournament arena is my favorite way to earn cash. It's lots of fun and earns you tons of money. You can even play against friends! Good tournament arena multiplayer games include dogbeards bathtub battles, farming frenzy, atomicolicious, supermodelz, and more. Quick tournaments are good because you earn the cash you got from playing the game and the bonus if you are ranked high. The easiest way to get kinzcash is to adopt more webkinz. You get $2000 and lots of free bonuses which depend on what pet it is (your 10th, 20th, etc. ) MOST IMPORTANTLY! SAVEEE! Don't spend your money on things you don't need. If you keep saving, you'll have lots and lots of awesome cash. If you do spend your cash on stuff, earn it back with one of the ways above. And no matter what, don't cheat! Most "cheats" are scams that other users use to get your hard earned cash or even account. If you do cheat and take advantage of the system's glitches you're account will go bye-bye, so don't do it! I've been playing webkinz for over a year and have about 30 webkinz, a gigantic house, and lots of kinzcash! So these tips will hopefully help you! =]
AA12173903	xbox 360 definitely, better graphics, better game choices, but unfortunately higher prices for xbox live and downloadable content, and other stuff...|`|761b1b253238b963d66bc11effcc8b40aa	PS3 has better real next gen HD games on the next generation movie format Blu-ray Disc. You should get PS3 cuzz Xbox 360 just has FPS games only nothing else PS3 has so many cool games exclusive like MGS4 GT5 SOCOM Uncharted Resistance Heavenly Sword Warhawk FFXIII and many more. And PS3 can read and supports all media cards Xbox not even one. PS3 is free online and has the best camera to video chat and PS3 has remote play which is cool if you own a PSP you can play your games from any in the world by using remote play. Also Xbox 360 has no next gen disc format just DVD9 which is too small for next gen games coming out so you might have to sacrife your small HD memory that the Xbox brings. PS3 is the only real true next gen gaming system with everything your ever dream about. With the PLAYSTATION 3 all your wishes are come true every game is made in real uncompress HD unlike Xbox 360 doesn't have real HD graphics. Buy a PS3  Xbox over heats after a couple hours of playing and it has a %33 failure rate it take like 2 months to fix and when u send it to get it fix u get another use system not worth investing your money on crap like Xbox 360 i have 1. The PS3 has no failure rate and is %100 reliable has perfect games buy it you will love it.|`|59lJEXPKaa	both are good but the xbox has better online gaming.  good luck hope to run into you on xbox live|`|7633fb6dd15a1316f3aff2222e6239f1aa	If you get the PS3 then you should buy the 80GB or higher, anything lower is just a waste of money. The PS3 is great bc you can chat with more than one friend unlike the 360. you can also web chat with more than one friend as well. Also on the PS3 if your friend has an enormous collection of games and movies on their PS3 so long as they allow you access you can use whatever they have in their PS3 library.<br>  <br>  the 360 is great for online gaming, especially if you're into multiplayer and FPS (first person shooters) Playstation isn't really big on FPS genre, although Resident Evil series is definitely a great series. <br>  <br>  It all depends on what console you're looking to get, if you're a solo player or more into online play and what your friends have. But all in all i'd suggest getting PS3 until Microsoft can get their act together with the 360 which has a life expectancy of only 3 years max.|`|7rdHYhoKaa	I'd go for a PS3, you'll have the most advantage in the future with it. Xbox360 might have better games at the moment, but you should know xbox360 was released WAY earlier than the PS3. But tbh, the PS3 has got enough games to keep you busy at the moment, also playing online is free.|`|RMjyfOBmaa	Ps3 cuz its true HD plus built in blu-ray|`|U3u2zZHWaa	I will go for Xbox 360|`|XnMOwYtqaa	It depends, there are more games for the Xbox 360 then the PS3, however you have to spend extra $100 on the HD-DVD player which is sold seprate from the console. That could congest the area where you put it.  Or for about $100 (compared to the price of the 360) more you could get the PS3, that comes with a Blu-Ray Dvd player. Note that Blu-Ray Dvd players by themselves are worth about a couple hundred.  And each system exclusive games for their console like Gears of War for the Xbox 360 and Rachet and Clank for PS3.  I have the xbox 360, i love it! But i do plan on buy the PS3 in the future though.|`|mLrD5mbBaa	On paper the PS3 is a better system (by a little) but due to the simple fact the games on 360 are more readily available<br>  I would chose the 360. Online play on 360 blows the ps3 out of the water but let the games decide for you. Its all a matter of opinion...<br>  <br>  Some PS3 exclusives out now (im sure i left some out)<br>  Uncharted<br>  Resistence<br>  Heavenly Sword<br>  Folklore<br>  Ratchet & Clank<br>  MLB & NBA the show<br>  Eye of Judgement<br>  <br>  Some 360 exclusives out now (im sure i left some out)<br>  Mass Effect<br>  Bioshock<br>  Gears of War<br>  Saint's Row<br>  Frontlines fuels of war<br>  Scene It<br>  Ace Combat 6<br>  & of course Halo 3<br>  11 hours ago - Edit - Delete|`|mnEmB8leaa	xbox 360 you noob ps3 sucks no games~~~~<br>  <br>  360 all games all online<br>  <br>  just editing some stuff for the bottom<br>  yes it was in the news "if you had your system for 4 month it be broke soon" come on thats for the luanch systems there are newer systems out there with falcon chips reduce the over heat big time  had my system for 6 months now no proplem so far and have 4 ffriends had there system over year and half no proplems <br>  <br>  then you dont gotta buy a hd player~wtf is the point? zomg you need see 2 more spots of dirt on the ground wow iut gots a built in dvd player you dont need HD to watch great movies and plus if you did have a good tv it would do the hd dvd job and plus you on a HD system<br>  <br>  other thing at the bottom<br>  how the 360 had a 3 year life span? most BS i heard today lol why would you get 3 year warrnty then lol your system blows 2 years and 11 months and get new one from microsoft and your warrnty starts back up just for that new 360 thats 6 year warrnty lol just for the system thats a deal  lol come on|`|uqeW27j5aa	If you go with PS3 (cuz i have one) it has<br>  bluray dvd thing<br>  i think you can play ps2 games<br>  it has 80gb<br>  and its cool<br>  But if you buy XBOX360<br>  in the news they said that the xbox will not work if you played it 4 months i think and there is a big problem about the xbox|`|wPcvdJEnaa	PS3 has blue-ray and a decent hard-drive.<br>  But it is your choice as some games are exclusive to the 360.|`|zBW82dZOaa	Ps3 is better because it has double the power

This is a classic novelty that makes a little plastic "fish" the "fortune telling mind reader." Place the magical red Fortune Telling Fish on the palm of your hand and watch it begin to move, wiggle, curl up or flip off your hand all by itself! Kids love them! Great for in-class demonstrations.

6n4AT6Qbaa	If i was you, i would probably go with buying the Djembe. The Djembe is a very common drum all over. If you want that real strong african sound, then i would go with the Djembe. Bongos and Congo's are also common, but not as Traditional as the Djembe. To go about buying a drum in general keep in mind that Traditionally crafted drums are carved in one single piece from hollowed out hardwood trees. This will define the sound quality. Its also nice to have design on the drum as well. Go for it, and good luck. |`|YRrGv82Zaa	I like  a Djembe.<br>  We have a instrument store's here which encourage using the Instruments.

It takes about an hour or two and afterwords we've spent some deep quality time together and he learned something new. We also take frequent trips to the mall, I grab a coffee (cost $2) and he plays in the public play area for free. We also bake cookies together, make pasta sauces together (he chops mushrooms with a plastic knife), we make homeade playdoh together... anything can be fun if you do it together.. but then again he's only 5, it depends on how old your little ones are.|`|ddb263a51f33d9d468e28d96dd727a30aa	Take them to a museum, the zoo, take advantage of free things offered in the community that are free, like plays or carnivals, kids don't really get out much nowadays it seems they only  get to go to the mall or somewhere where money is required.

Aus dieser Scheibe wird eine Spirale verfertigt, indem man von au?en her einen ca. 1,5 cm breiten Streifen schneidet, so dass das Ganz wie ein Schneckenhaus aussieht. In der Mitte l?sst man ein etwas breiteres Stück, das wird auf die Nadelspitze gesetzt. Nun h?ngt die Spirale nach unten, darf aber nicht den Boden berühren.<br>  <br>  Falls diese mittlere Scheibe von der Nadelspitze rutscht, kann man eine Verst?rkung drunter kleben und ein kleines Loch rein machen, wo die Nadelspitze stecken bleibt.<br>  <br>  So, das Ganz jetzt auf die Zentralheizung oder den kachelofen stellen, dann bewegt die aufsteigende warme Luft die Spirale, das sieht hübsch aus und entlockt den Kindern ein Ah! und Oh! und sie lernen was über Physik.<br>  <br>  Wenn das nicht reicht, k?nnt ihr zum Beispiel aus winzigen Watteb?uschchen etc. kleine Schneeh?schen formen und mit Uhu auf die Spirale verteilen, das sieht dann aus, wenn die Spirale sich dreht, als würden sie die Schr?ge hinunter rutschen. "Sü?!!!"<br>  <br>  Viel Vergnügen!

YvUOGaGHaa	No, you cannot catch them in the wild.<br>  <br>  I think I know why someone might have said something like this. after you SEE all of the Pokemon for the original Pokedex in Dimaond/Pearl, you are allowed to go to an area called Pal Park where you can "migrate" Pokemon from one of your old games. (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Leafgreen, or Firered) Then you go to Pal Park and "catch" them with Pokeballs the area supplies you with that work like Masterballs, so technically you aren't catching them so much as just giving them over from an old game.<br>  <br>  If you have Emerald, and you have Pokemon you don't really want to migrate but you need on Diamond or Pearl, go to my Yahoo! Answers profile and through that my 360 page. There I have a blog that gives you steps you "duplicate" Pokemon in Emerald.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|38a6fd52e4defeb26b6867bcc304b44faa	No, you can't catch them in the wild.|`|jc0ZTvapaa	no it is not|`|n61op6jNaa	No, you can only get the starters at the start, like any other pokemon game.|`|v0En4KOwaa	NO, i wish you could.
