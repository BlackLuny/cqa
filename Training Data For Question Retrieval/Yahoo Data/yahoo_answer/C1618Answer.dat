mDDUsNG9aa	I just moved to the Leigh high valley about 4 years ago and from my experience is this Allentown is ok there is crime there is gangs, but there are nice areas of the city..As far as being an emt I know they just posted paramedic jobs. I posted the link to the offical website..Happy Trails|`|XzLUA7ataa	I worked in center city Allentown for 17 years and was happy to retire and get away from there.  The winter season, is bleak and cold, so unless you are a snow and ski buff the bar scene may be all you find.<br>  You can commute to Philadelphia, New York or the New Jersey Shore resorts, but it takes a couple of hours and you may not be able to to that every weekend.  There is suburban acreage available for sale but it is not inexpensive.  You can attend Kutztown State University to study to become an English teacher, that's about half an hour commute.  There are a few EMT jobs available and training for them but the rate of pay is modest and the hours long. I've never lived in NC.|`|e5d1a8b9a4835a1735077743c45baf18aa	I live in Philly and a lot of the fire departments in smaller towns usually only volunteers. Also Allentown has nothing going on ....except Dorney Park. You have to get on a toll highway to go pretty much anywhere. There is also a lot of crime and unemployment there as well. I know several families who have left Allentown for work. It is also not cheap to live there although you would think it would be. Allentown doesn't have that much of a bar scene...just lots of malls. I would shoot for Charlotte.....you'll probably find more of what you're looking for.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	Allentown is pretty good.  There are some parts better than others, but on a whole it's a nice city.  The Lehigh Valley in general is a good place to live, and if you get bored with it, you're only about an hour from both NYC and Philly.  Allentown has a pretty good bar scene, and several that regularly have rock shows, notably the Crocodile Rock Cafe.  The area has recovered a lot since the steel industry collapsed, and even the worst hit areas of Bethlehem are cleaning up nicely.  There are tons of small towns in the area in addition to Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton, if you want something less urban, and lots of open country left as well, which might help in finding that house.|`|AA12018303	As a transplant from Philadelphia to Allentown, I have to say I made the right choice.  Allentown is like having a miniature version of a big city with all of the comforts of suburban life.  It's not really just Allentown though, it's really the Lehigh Valley which comprises of Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton.  With all of the universities in the area there are no shortage of good bars, and the beauty of Allentown is that beer can still be had for a buck.  I don't know much about Charlotte, but as a late 20 something, I do like it here.|`|fvN18yvGaa	DMGR an N have the best answers...Allentown and the Lehigh valley area offer a little bit of what ever type of living u want..but Im not that sure about the FD.  Allentown is not as big as Philly so its department is small and probaly difficult to get into.. and probaly the only paid dept in the region..

Flight attendants are waitresses with a very short and simple menu, but without the drive to earn good tips.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Flight attendants are safety technicians. Their job is to keep passengers alive in the event of an accident.  They train extensively for that, and most of them do it well. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), their skills are not often called upon, since airline accidents are extremely rare.<br>  <br>  When they are not performing their primary job as safety technicians, they engage in busy work such as catering to passengers and improving public customer relations for the airline. Because this secondary responsibility is so visible, and because accidents that call on their primary responsibilities are so extraordinarily rare, some uninformed people blithely assume that they are mere waitresses.

7uffHRdkaa	I'm not from California, so I couldn't really tell you, but from what I've heard, there's places around Bakersfield that are. Part of this is because many people who settled there in a couple different time periods were southern and mid-western. The ''Okies'' and ''Arkies'' in the 1930's moved out there somewhat because of natural disasters that forced them to leave there homes. Than in the 50's, 60's and 70's, people from Louisana, Texas and Oklahoma moved there to take jobs (many related to oil industry). You could see that under the ''Founding'' tab on the Wikipedia article about Bakersfield. Southern California is really progressive though and this is a highly populated area that draws a lot of new immigrants, so I don't know if this place is the best representation of what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  The problem with this question is people might take the word ''redneck'' the wrong way? I know you didn't me for it to come off condescendingly, but some still will see it that way. I honestly don't know what would be the best proper substitute to use though. You can't really say southern or mid-westerern, because most of these people are Californians. You can't say ''hickish'' because it'll leave the same tone as ''redneck.'' I guess you can say ''rural'', but that doesn't necessarily have to mean backwards or less affluent.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	Yreka<br>  Redding<br>  Fresno<br>  Bakersfield<br>  Oakdale<br>  Willits<br>  Escalon<br>  Visalia<br>  Turlock

wqP8ACpBaa	You can get there two ways. <br>  <br>  I just can't remember the details for I haven't back in Manila in many years.<br>  <br>  First you need to go to EDSA from your place that would be via Aurora. Then at EDSA you get a ride from any BUS going to Makati, Pasay, Alabang, it doesn't matter just as long as it would pass by Ortigas. Ortigas is the key place that you need to go to. Then from there get a ride from a bus or a jeep going to Greenhills & to San Juan in general.<br>  <br>  You can also take the MRT of course. <br>  <br>  Then as I have said, you either go down at Ortigas or at a bus stop fronting Gate 4 of Camp Aguinaldo. It is called Gate 5 as far as I know, & there used to be a gasoline station over there. Then there should be jeeps going to the Greenhills Shopping Center if that is where you are going to, so that is the quicker/easier way to do it.<br>  <br>  The other way is to just go to Ortigas, I do not know where you are in Marikina but there are lot of jeeps that would take you there, possible to Rosario or to Junction or to whatever part of Ortigas. Then from there you can get a ride to San Juan by bus or jeep.|`|BlNqwEnwaa	i did this last augest i caught jeepney to mrt then mrt to marikina i had to transfer 2 times total was 200p took about 1 hr and half becuse i just missed the train for marikina or just take taxi from green hills mall to mrt 60p maybe 80p then mrt i hope that helps|`|xxhlloQkaa	Take a jeep with signboard of Cubao/Aurora via Stop and Shop and then baba kana sa Aurora opposite of Gateway Mall and across the Gateway Mall then there's a stairway connecting from gateway in 2nd level going to farmers then straight ahead until sa may loob ng mrt sa may tawiran doon then baba at doon ka na sumakay ng bus with sign board of Ortigas/MOA/Alabang/Baclaran and asked the conductor na baba ka na sa gate 4 (sa Caltex) then lakad lang konti at may naka stand by ng jeep papunta sa Greenhills/ baba ka na sa may Robinson's Galleria at doon ka na sakay ng jeep papunta sa Greenhills!!!Gud luck!!|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Take a taxi!<br>  Ask the policemen how to go there and he will tell you what bus to take where to take it and will even tell you how much you have to pay!

That means there is no such thing as Cheap! the prices between schools and programs vary but in the end you will be paying pretty much the same thing wherever you go. <br>  <br>  There are two universities in Toronto: The university of Toronto and York, York is probably marginally cheaper<br>  <br>  In Ottawa there are also two universities The university of Ottawa and Carlton they are probably about the same price. <br>  <br>  The cheapest university is likely Nipissing because it's so far North. <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nipissingu.ca/</a> there's a link living expenses would also be cheapest there because it's in a smaller city and it's further North. <br>  <br>  Also that other poster is right your going to have to pay international fees and your tuition will be way higher then a Canadian going to a Canadian school. Also sounds like you need to do more research and find out what schools offer masters degrees in your program - usually graduate students work as Teaching assistants and you earn enough doing that to cover tuition and most of your expenses research some schools and find out for yourself that's the only way to get the whole picture.|`|DTNlqnOEaa	As a non citizen of Canada, you will have to pay MORE than a Canadian, for any University course here.<br>  <br>  Why ?

eCjx7kLAaa	Well, your relating the area to Central PA is correct, in that it's the same sort of old industrial small city area, and that probably has some impact on their language.  As to why they get offended though, I would imagine it's simply because they're northerners, and a good way to insult a northerner is to imply that they are at all southern, regardless of how accurate it may be.  Note, don't call them midwestern either, almost as bad as southern.  It's a cultural hangup from the 1800s.  Northeasterners have a notably small world view of where the cultured part of the country ends, and New Englanders look upon PA as the wilderness, and PA's response is to staunchly defend it's northeasterness.  I doubt many people take it seriously though, it's just a cultural quirk of the area.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	I spent a lot of time in scranton. they don't sound southern at all. it's called coal crackin'. There is a mix of polish,Italian, Lithuanian, german and other northern Europeans from way back. there is local jargon and accent such as 'hayna? = ain't it?  joo eat? =did you eat? bah-ul for bottle..sahs for sause, sammich for sandwitch. You'll hear a different jargon in central Pa and yet anothr in the Pittsburgh area. Example pound is pronounced paand.
2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	i'd say nowadays about 25%, or maybe even fewer. not like in my day in the 1960's when there wasn't so much mobility as there is today.<br>  <br>  i'm a native Manhattanite, having been born in the East Village and growing up in Little Italy...<br>  <br>  and €ura, where the f*ck do you get off insulting us Manhattanites, whether we're native or transplants? i don't go around bashing people from the outer boroughs. you need to grow up...<br>  <br>  EDIT: Tom, point understood. apologies to €ura. Manhattan has always been relatively more expensive that the outer boroughs, even in the depths of the 1970's. but a lot of us "older timers" are still here because we either bought our places when they were giving them away, or have been rent stabilized/controlled for the past 30+ years. in a sense the high prices the newcomers are paying are subsidizing the rest of us. not necessarily fair, but it seems to maintain a lot of the diversity we still enjoy here. and Manhattan is still *the* meeting place of the world, whether you're from Brooklyn or Bangladesh...|`|gJ8F634Haa	Believe it or not, it's higher than what most people think.

You NEVER find anyone who says they're from or were born and raised in Manhattan.  Most of the people who live in Manhattan are stupid enough to pay the rent and deal with the crowds - they're all transplants looking for life of fashion, glamor, or just because they want to feel cool.  And, yes, I agree with the mid-Western comment (though they may or may not be weirdos, I can't be sure of that), and, to a lesser extent the "weirdos" from the rest of the country - the ones who come to be "actresses" or "artists" or some sort or other big star, but become washed out after five years of trying (then they go home or move to Jersey, lol).  <br>  <br>  I've never met a living soul who grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, or Bronx who moved to Manhattan.  I'm from Brooklyn and I wouldn't go unless I was literally paid to.  There are nicer, more convenient, safer and definitely more affordable areas here and in Queens than the whole of Manhattan.  I would say that about 65% to 70% of Queens and Brooklyn are made up of native New Yorkers - those who aren't native are foreign, and, to a lesser extent, the smarter Americans who moved there to pay 50% less rent or students of schools like Brooklyn Law or St. John's (in Queens).  The Bronx (the southern parts, not the north that borders Westchester County) and Staten Island, I would say 90% are natives.<br>  <br>  What's up, doc- where in my answer did I imply that Queens ISN'T a diverse borough?  I know it's a diverse borough, as is Brooklyn - that was the whole point of my answer.  And I can guarantee that some of the speakers of those 125 languages are SECOND generation residents - i.e., they were born and raised in New York (because Queens is still considered part of New York City).  I'm an example of that myself.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	I'd say at most...anywhere between B and C, but thats wishful thinking. <br>  <br>  The problem is, after Giuliani cleaned out the city the midwestern weirdos and yuppie lames just came pouring in...the rents skyrocketed to the point that many, if not most of the native New Yorkers and longtime residents were pushed out and forced to live in the outer boroughs and even in Jersey. <br>  <br>  There's transplants everywhere in this city, but they're mainly concentrated in all of the neighborhoods south of Harlem.
COSvrQUcaa	Well the age is 18. We are allowed to drink under 18 at home with parents. But like sooo many teens are underage drinkers. I'm 16 and whenever i go out with my friends and people my age 99% of them drink like. And we're not out of control teens either.

But our school in in the top 10 in ireland just incase people were thinking it was a hole!<br>  <br>  Thats just what happens.|`|afeoTehEaa	Officially it's 18 but in reality it's about 13.|`|xsP90gEbaa	18|`|XcB06N6maa	i think its 18 :)|`|Ssn0ojAGaa	Here is the proper term:<br>  <br>  Under the intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to drink alcohol. It is also illegal for an adult to buy drink for a minor.<br>  <br>  However the act states: "It shall not be unlawful for a person (other than the holder of a licence of licensed premises) to purchase or deliver intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under the age of 18 years in a private residence with the explicit consent of that person's parent or guardian." <br>  <br>  So in pubs, off licence, etc no, but at home with parent with consent yes.<br>  <br>  Licence holders that allow people between 18-21 years on their premises without appropriate identification can face a fine of €1,500 for a first offence and €2,000 for any subsequent offences. (Appropriate identification includes a National Age Card, a passport, a driving licence, or an identity card issued by a EU member state).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/alcohol_and_the_law" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizensinformation.ie/catego...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also note some clubs, pubs over 21, 23.<br>  <br>  good Luck|`|wEUUnUK2aa	yesh they can order alcohol for you, but its against the law for you to drink it in a public place, under 18s are allowed to drink at home under parents supervision but not in public places as its against the law,|`|wNZ95AK3aa	only over 18's will be allowed into clubs and some are even over 21's.you may sit in a pub at any age once you are with an adult but wont be allowed alcohol|`|bM5zXRsGaa	18, but it's more like whenever you feel like it.|`|GxKfvloHaa	Its 18|`|uJDCoXH9aa	12 =]|`|qKUMaJcXaa	13 i think|`|usmvydiaaa	probs be 18|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's 18.|`|Zadysvg5aa	It is not true that someone can buy alcohol for you at 16.<br>  It is NOT an offence to drink alcohol under the age of 18, but it is against the law for someone to sell alcohol to someone under 18. This misunderstanding came about when a father gave his daughter a glass of wine in a restaurant, with a meal, and the proprietor attempted to remove the wine from the minor. The father sued the restaurant and won his case.<br>  It doesn't mean that 4 guys can go into a bar, 3 of them are 16 and one is 18, and the 18 year old can buy the booze for the minors to drink. If that happens the 16 year old drinkers are not breaking the law but the publican is.

Merchantmen ships delivered fabrics manufactured in Britain to India and China but would return empty or partially full. To solve this problem the East India Company began a vigorous public relations campaign to popularize tea among the common people in Britain and develop it as a viable return cargo.<br>  The escalation of tea importation and sales over the period 1690 to 1750 is mirrored closely by the increase in importation and sales of cane sugar: the British were not drinking just tea but sweet tea.[36] Thus, two of Britain's trading triangles were to meet within the cup: the sugar sourced from Britain's trading triangle encompassing Britain, Africa and the West Indies and the tea from the triangle encompassing Britain, India and China.[36]<br>  Britain had to pay China for its tea, but China had little need of British goods, so much of it was paid for with silver bullion. Critics of tea at this time would point to the damage caused to Britain's wealth by this loss of bullion.[36] As an alternative, Britain began producing opium in India and forced China to trade tea for opium as part of several treaties after the Opium wars. Tea became an important lubricant of Britain's global trade, contributing to Britain's global dominance by the end of the eighteenth century. To this day tea is seen as a symbol of 'Britishness', but also, to some, as a symbol of British Colonialism.[36] The London 2012 section of the paralympic handover in Beijing included tea as part of the routine[clarification needed], such is the strong connection made between Britain and tea. Tea is widely drunk throughout the nation.

It is organised by ID&T and has been held from 1999 to the present day in various venues in the Netherlands twice a year. Traditionally, there was a "small" edition and a big edition each year. In 2002, the small edition failed to sell out its 20,000-person ticket capacity (only 15,000 tickets were sold) and thereafter, Trance Energy was only held once annually, at the Jaarbeurs convention center in Utrecht, Netherlands where it has since been sold out each year.<br>  <br>  While audience in the first years was mostly Dutch, there are now many international visitors, mainly from the European Union but sometimes from other areas around the world. This is due to the festival earning worldwide fame thanks to bootlegs of DJ mixes and some official videos of former editions.<br>  <br>  Drug Policy: Despite the fact that the party is held in the Netherlands, even soft drugs are not allowed inside the party. This is due to the municipality of Utrecht imposing a Zero Tolerance Policy to all events held in Jaarbeurs. All persons who enter are patted down and searched for illicit drugs. Such zero-tolerance policies at dance parties are now becoming common in the Netherlands and are even stricter in cities like Arnhem. Despite this, it is still possible to smuggle in drugs for personal use in one's underwear, for example. Many visitors are not prepared however, and get very disappointed when they either get their drugs confiscated or are fined at the gate.<br>  <br>  The Trance Energy event venue is Jaarbeurs Utrecht on March 7, 2009|`|AA11471769	RYan air fly to eindhoven its only about half an hour to utrecht from there by train?

If you like technological equipment, maybe Best Buy? Radio Shack? If you like retail, maybe Home Depot or Lowes? There's always lots of jobs in mall.

df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	This is an important decision if you are a teacher because it is hard for a teacher to move from one state to another or even from one district to another, in some states.  Often teachers get to retire with a full pension after a fixed number of years, maybe  30, but you start counting all over again if you move to another state. There's a lot to be said for having the option to retire in your early 50's, and if you would rather continue teaching then you can pick up your pension and start teaching in private school or abroad. <br>  <br>  There are some places that are "hidden gems" that I would consider if I were you.  Try to find a good school system in Kentucky or Tennessee or West Virginia.  You will find a nice, supportive community that respects teachers. Your pay will be less than in many places, but your expenses will be much lower, too.  You want a small city or town of 10,000 to 50,000 people.  Discipline is less of a problem than in a big city.  <br>  <br>  The weather in these states meets your criteria for summer and winters and a real fall.  You can live in a pretty mountain valley town with a river running through it.  You can buy an affordable home that is close enough to your school that you can walk to it, and a town where you could raise a family. <br>  <br>  You can explore these places from your computer.  Try Google map to see some of the smaller towns, and then check out real estate prices in by checking real estate listing online.  You can buy a lot of house in West Virginia on a teacher's salary compared to many places.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Canada?<br>  I live in Germany and you get sick of snow really quickly, especially when it melts and is all slushy and dirty in the city.

2ef9de5a6d07c56b24d8e40822fb7f15aa	OK. I'm an American married to a Filipina. Your husband can come here without a visa. However, within 21 days he has to apply for a 2 month visa (at BI or for bit of money at a travel agency). Then he can start getting the paperwork together to get an ACR (Alien Cert. of Residency). Expect to pay maybe 6-7 thou peso to the crooks and thieves at BI (speaking from experience). While this process is going on, your husband can keep extending his visa at BI by 2 month increments.  <br>  BTW, your green card has nothing to do with your husbands ACR. So... Assume he gets it, he will still have to report any changes during the first 2 months of the year for 300P. That's all.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	When you arrived in the Philippines, be sure to extend your visa for a year, before the 12 days visa expire.  You have to brings your papers and documents certifying that you are legally married and your husband has financial support to take care of himself and you too, during his stays in the Philippines.  If you have those two very important documents with you, then you can enjoy your stay here in the Philippines.  If in doubt, contact again the Philippine Embassy, either by phone or by personal visit.  They will only be too glad to help you.|`|VGMFkcziaa	There is nothing to worry about that coz your husband will getting a 23days visa on arrival and yes he is your husband and you're a filipino just bring some document to prove i guess.<br>  <br>  Anyho, you should ask your nearest embassy of  what are the requiremnet you need to bring or to do before you arrive for your husband.

When you arrive in Frankfurt, you'll need to go through passport control there; you will go pass a customs point right past the passport control, but I've never been stopped there in all the times I've flown through Frankfurt. Your checked bags will be checked all the way to Spain and you don't pick them up until you get there as opposed to flying into the US where you pick up your bags at your first arrival point and recheck them. You will have to go through a security checkpoint to get into the section of the airport where your flight to Spain will be. When you get to Spain, you do not go through a passport control again, but you do go through customs when you pick up your bag.|`|AA11471769	no sweat they no what you are doing?

AA11298562	Beats walking.  Are you going alone?  It's best if you have someone with you, even just a girlfriend, it makes you less of a target.  Try to catch the bus in a well-lit area that is near a store or some place with people around.  If you can, carry a can of mace or pepper spray and a cell phone (to call 911 if necessary).<br>  Situations like this are almost never as dangerous as people make them out to be.  99% chance is, nothing will happen.  It's that 1% you have to be prepared for.

AA11043094	You don't just need an adapter (for the different plugs) <br>  you also need a CONVERTER for the different voltage|`|tQsxsuNPaa	The reason you were having trouble with blowing fuses may very well have to do with voltage, though I always thought that you were more likely to blow your own appliance than to blow the electricity the other way! <br>  <br>  Yeah, they only HAVE two prongs in the walls, there.<br>  <br>  What sort of places are you staying in?  How long are you going to be? <br>  <br>  Best suggestion, go to the store, like, just Walmart, and BUY yourself a new iron and hairdryer WITH DUAL VOLTAGE BUILT IN.  Because those kinds of things exist.  Then, all you need is the plug adapter...and you can buy those at any hardware store in Spain...you are better off doing it that way, because the plugs in Spain LOOK like the plugs in some other countries, and you will quite likely wind up with the wrong ones.  There are about two hardware stores on just about every block in Spain, so finding them shouldn't be a problem.  <br>  <br>  That, too, may have been your problem in Argentina.  That the plug you had wasn't quite right for their outlets.  You can buy the necessary adapters at any luggage store in the US...department stores, AAA, or Walmart, Target, Kmart.  But finding someone who is knowledgeable about which ones are for Spain can sometimes be a trick.  I would suggest waiting until you are there.  <br>  <br>  Many hotels actually have what you need at the front desk.|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	The mains voltage in Spain is 230V. 50 HZ USA is 60HZ You will need a transformer not a converter.

You may be lucky.<br>  <br>  Without being too technical, the voltage here in Spain is 230/240. . voltsThe US has, I believe, 110 volts or so. If you plug your iron in  in Spain there will be a strong burning smell probably followed by flames!
zon13nY2aa	You must visit Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. They are next to each other and you will probably need 1 day in each park. Your kids are a good age to go there and you will love all the rides, especially Spiderman at Islands of Adventure.<br>  <br>  There are 4 Disney parks - Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios and Epcot. I recommend going to them all. Magic Kingdom has a lot of attractions aimed at younger children, but it is worth a visit because it is typical Disney and there's still loads to do for older kids too.<br>  <br>  If you fancy having a day at a waterpark then the 2 Disney ones are good. They're called Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon.<br>  <br>  Seaworld is a really good day out, especially if you like sealife! And there are some thrill rides too.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is avoid the school holidays! Avoid Spring Break. Avoid the Summer.<br>  <br>  I can recommend staying at a hotel on International Drive. We usually stay at the Rosen Plaza which is really nice and plush. For a cheaper alternative, the Best Western Plaza International is basic but clean and has everything you need. International Drive is a great base because all the parks are nearby, and there are loads of restaurants along the road.<br>  <br>  If you book through a travel operator like Virgin, for example, you can also buy your park tickets through them and Virgins prices are the cheapest I have found anywhere else! Alternatively use a reputable website such as www.onlineflorida.co.uk<br>  <br>  x|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Try looking at the Seralago hotel in Kissimmee it is right next old town. They have rides and games and even shopping. You can get a 2 room suite so that everyone will have their own bed. I have 2 boys ages 9 and 15. They liked Universal but did not chose to visit that park this year. You can do Universal in one day and Islands of Adventure in one day. My boys truly love Seaworld, Aquatica, and Bush Gardens. We are going to try out Wet n Wild this year. Since you are planning in 2010 look at Discovery Cove (very expensive) but would love to go there. See if you can get a copy of Extreme Seaworld brodcasted on the Travel Channel that shows everything they have to offer.|`|kGCsDFjwaa	we prefer universal, but i guess disney has its pluses.

How long are you going for? jacksonville, St Augustine, Daytona beach and Miami beach are also good places. Cocoa Beach is a beautiful place. it  has lovely beaches and lots of  surf shops etc. i am not sure where you and your family should stay, accomidation is a personal preference, so im not sure about that.

St Augustine is a lovely old Spanish Town, hotel accommodation is easy to source, some a great deals cheaper than others, check out the hotel chains such as Ramada and Howard Johnson (HoJo) or if you don't mind cheaper accommodation try the Motel 6.  If you want to go to the Theme Parks Busch Gardens in Tampa is brilliant and if you buy a Ticket for this park you get a free pass for a day at Sea World.  Try to avoid July, August and September as it can be hot humid and also very wet.  I have found the best time to go is October and November its still around 80 deg Fahrenheit.  Try looking on Expeida for the best flights and go from there - avoid International Drive Hotels. Don't tie yourself to one place and you will have a great time.|`|tv0xUCoGaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Florida Disney world is one of the most popular theme parks in the world.

It has the killer whales, polar bears, dolphins, etc. And Discovery Cove which is expensive but it really is unforgettable, also once your in there everything's all-inclusive and you get to go swimming with the Dolphins but you need to book that before you go, the first time we went to Florida we went to book it while we were out there and they told us we needed to book month's in advance. <br>  Some part's of Disneyland were good, I think any of them are good as long as you avoid Magic Kingdom which is for very small children mostly. But none of the Disneyland's were as good as Universal Studio's but if you're going to Universal Studio's get the FastTrack tickets, you can buy them on the day but there is a limited amount, queue time for rides were about 40 minutes - over an hour but when we had the FastTrack tickets the most we waited was about 20 minutes.<br>  Good places to eat at Florida are Denny's, Ponderosa, Outbacks, Golden Coral and Perkins but there really are so many to choose from. You get free refills on most soft drinks over there as well.<br>  We went in May the first time and I personally thought that this was the best time to go because when we went later on in the year we really did struggle with the heat and my family is a family who loves sun and hot weather. We were trying to walk round Animal Kingdom in DisneyLand on Florida's hottest day of the year and ended up coming home because it was unbearable. <br>  I can't really advise you on hotels as we booked a house for two weeks, but I think that was on a golf course called Golden Dunes which was right next to a Walmart (the equivelent of ASDA) plus had it's own private pool.<br>  We did have to stay in a hotel one night which was uncomfortable and my family really didn't like it which was called Howard Johnson but I'm told that they're quite notorius for not being very nice places to stay. <br>  <br>  Have a nice time!!

wVNwoEfCaa	Israel government doesn't want a viable Palestinian state full stop,.  They do everything in their power to keep that from happening.  How can Gaza, for example make anything out of its self without being able to control their borders?

I think what is going on there is the same reason why there are some suspicions of me in the Jewish community. Look, we don’t do nuance well in politics and especially don’t do it well on Middle East policy. We look at things as black and white, and not gray. It’s conceivable that there are those in the Arab world who say to themselves, “This is a guy who spent some time in the Muslim world, has a middle name of Hussein, and appears more worldly and has called for talks with people, and so he’s not going to be engaging in the same sort of cowboy diplomacy as George Bush,” and that’s something they’re hopeful about. I think that’s a perfectly legitimate perception as long as they’re not confused about my unyielding support for Israel’s security. <br>  <br>  When I visited Ramallah, among a group of Palestinian students, one of the things that I said to those students was: “Look, I am sympathetic to you and the need for you guys to have a country that can function, but understand this: if you’re waiting for America to distance itself from Israel, you are delusional. Because my commitment, our commitment, to Israel’s security is non-negotiable.” I’ve said this in front of audiences where, if there were any doubts about my position, that’d be a place where you’d hear it.<br>  <br>  The following will show you where his heart truly is and who helped him get his career started and his influencial friends.<br>  He did not even live in an "African-American neighborhood but lived in Hyde Park in the Chicago area which is a large mostly Jewish area:<br>  <br>  JG: Go to the kishke question, the gut question: the idea that if Jews know that you love them, then you can say whatever you want about Israel, but if we don’t know you –- Jim Baker, Zbigniew Brzezinski –- then everything is suspect. There seems to be in some quarters, in Florida and other places, a sense that you don’t feel Jewish worry the way a senator from New York would feel it.<br>  <br>  BO: I find that really interesting. I think the idea of Israel and the reality of Israel is one that I find important to me personally. Because it speaks to my history of being uprooted, it speaks to the African-American story of exodus, it describes the history of overcoming great odds and a courage and a commitment to carving out a democracy and prosperity in the midst of hardscrabble land. One of the things I loved about Israel when I went there is that the land itself is a metaphor for rebirth, for what’s been accomplished. What I also love about Israel is the fact that people argue about these issues, and that they’re asking themselves moral questions.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I’m attacked in the press for maybe being too deliberative. My staff teases me sometimes about anguishing over moral questions. I think I learned that partly from Jewish thought, that your actions have consequences and that they matter and that we have moral imperatives. The point is, if you look at my writings and my history, my commitment to Israel and the Jewish people is more than skin-deep and it’s more than political expediency. When it comes to the gut issue, I have such ardent defenders among my Jewish friends in Chicago. I don’t think people have noticed how fiercely they defend me, and how central they are to my success, because they’ve interacted with me long enough to know that I've got it in my gut. During the Wright episode, they didn’t flinch for a minute, because they know me and trust me, and they’ve seen me operate in difficult political situations.<br>  <br>  The other irony in this whole process is that in my early political life in Chicago, one of the raps against me in the black community is that I was too close to the Jews. When I ran against Bobby Rush [for Congress], the perception was that I was Hyde Park, I’m University of Chicago, I’ve got all these Jewish friends. When I started organizing, the two fellow organizers in Chicago were Jews, and I was attacked for associating with them. So I’ve been in the foxhole with my Jewish friends, so when I find on the national level my commitment being questioned, it’s curious.<br>  <br>  Here is another quote showing Obama's support of Israel and that Jerusalem will remain undivided and in full Israeli control.<br>  <br>  In June 2008, Obama became the first presidential candidate ever to publicly back the traditional Israeli position that Jerusalem remain forever undivided under Israel rule. "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided," Obama declared on June 4, 2008.[174][175] Days later, he said, "obviously, it's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations."[176]<br>  <br>  This can be read  further in the following link under section 2.4.11 of Foreign regions and Israel.<br>  <br>  Here is the link:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Barack_Obama#Israel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this will convince people that Obama is not for "real" change but for just more of the same with a good manner of public speaking.  Also it will show his true position on the viability of a real Palestinian separate state.|`|tod8jy9Paa	Just where will this viable state be ? Gaza is in ruins and the West Bank already has 280,000 illegal settlers living there. Israel has stolen all the rest of Palestine's land.It will need a large area to house 4 million Palestinian refugees. So unless Israel are made to go back to its 1967 borders ( and even America can't make them ) there will never be a 2 state solution

I pointed out to him that he needed to wait in line like everyone else.  I reminded him that we were both guests in Russia, that both of us were "lao wai."  He looked me straight in the eye and said, quite seriously, "Chinese people are NEVER 'lao wai.'  We are always 'lao nei.'" <br>  <br>  Why would you use a foreign word to describe someone outside of their homeland?  A Chinese person (non-citizen) in an English-speaking country would be called a number of things:  guest, visitor, foreigner, tourist, immigrant, green-card holder, student, etc.  An English speaker would not refer to that person as a "lao wai" as that term is unique to the Chinese language. <br>  <br>  By the way, I am a "lao wai" in China . . . been here a number of years.  I call myself a "lao wai" here and no one bats an eye about it.  It's a generally accepted term.|`|npmcbe0Raa	Lao wai is a person who is not Chinese.

But since Lao Wai is phrase where Chinese called Westerners and other foreigners in China or elsewhere, so its not so nice as to call them as Lao Wai by others.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	I don't see a problem in that. I understand that "Lao wai" stands for a foreigner in Chinese language.<br>  <br>  Only thing is you need to make sure that they don't have any patent or copyright on the usage of the word in the country you are planning to use it.|`|1LlhqADoaa	lol, If someone calls me "lao wai", It is so funny.<br>  Chinese are used to calling foreigners this designation.|`|kUJ8XbPUaa	Going by the context in which the word is used in China, I would say YES.|`|yJ4AJnrgaa	Will it offend them?
kUJ8XbPUaa	Everyone has a right to moan over everything as long as it makes sense to moan. I guess you are pointing towards China attacking western Imperialism and telling them to look at their own past record.<br>  <br>  I laugh at some of the answers here. West does not deny its past record of imperialism. Someone says that west has reaped the benefits of Asia without contributing much and they have no reason to complain. To him I say "what of Asians themselves reaping the benefits of Asia" or even of Europe? Someone does not lose right to point out a mistake just because he has committed the same mistake in the past. Human rights and sovereign rights do not stop at borders of continents, nor are they monopoly of Asians or Africans for that matter.<br>  <br>  I don't even buy the crap about the blood group being A+ or B- thing. Nor do I buy the narrow and bookish definition offered by Richard, which is taught to a fifth grader. Forgive me Richard to point you out. The sort of Imperialism you describe cannot exist today. I may not have witnessed the World War II but I understand that it was the death knell for that kind of imperialism. What we witness today is Imperialism by proxy. This essay of A J P Taylor will make an excellent reading for you <a href="http://www.panarchy.org/taylor/imperialism.1952.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.panarchy.org/taylor/imperiali...</a><br>  <br>  West didn’t invent imperialism. Imperialism always existed in Asia. There were always efforts on the same line as British/French/Dutch East India Company. Look at the Japan's efforts to secure Korea or even the parts of present day China. Look at South East Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia who came first under the influence of Indian merchants and later gave in to Arab influence. Look at Arab conquest of most of Asia because they were drunk  with the idea of superiority of Islam and changed the face of Asia. Jews were forced to leave their homeland and had to settle in different parts of the world. Zoroastrians forced to leave their homeland to save themselves from forced conversions and suppression by Muslim Invaders. Crusades, even though there was element of religion in them were fought on Imperialistic agenda of Arabs.<br>  <br>  And how can we forget China? Do we believe that vast land mass of China was a tooth fairy? Something that happened overnight with peace loving dynasties? China which is in the habit of playing victim of Imperialism and attacks western nations of being imperialistic, too has not been left behind. China may accuse Japan of aggression but itself has been aggressor to many neighboring nations.<br>  <br>  It was Quing Dynasty that expanded its borders to include Xinjiang and Tibet. In fact Manchus organized their armies around cavalry rather than the traditional infantries because they were more interested in projecting their power over neighboring nations and not just interested in defense. Taiwan and Mongolia too were not traditionally part of China but were conquered over different time frames. At some point of time China even conquered Northern part of Vietnam and Korea.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism_in_Asia#Imperialism_in_China" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism...</a> <br>  <br>  Chinese Domination of Vietnam<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chinese_domination_(History_of_Vietnam)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chine...</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chinese_domination_(History_of_Vietnam)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chin...</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Chinese_domination_(History_of_Vietnam)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Chine...</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Chinese_domination_(History_of_Vietnam)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Chin...</a> <br>  <br>  And for those who say that China has never engaged in imperialism on the western soil, here is the Genghis Khan’s conquest of Europe. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_inva...</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_under_the_Mongol_Empi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction...</a><br>  <br>  I remember a film made in China on the life of Ghengis Khan which portrayed him as Chinese Hero. <br>  <br>  It just so happened that Chinese Emperors found it hard to control the vast stretch of land they had conquered and one dynasty after another fell under this burden to make room for another.<br>  <br>  And we very well see the modern face of Chinese Imperialism in Africa where arms are supplied to rogue states to continue genocide just because those heads of those states are willing to accommodate China's interest. I find a strange similarity between the expressed colonialism of British and the modern day colonialism of Chinese. Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem "The White Man's Burden" in which  he offered a rhetorical command to white men to colonize and rule people of other nations for their own benefit, because they were uncivilized and it was the burden of the white race to civilize them. China too is resorting to "Chinese People's Burden" sort of thing in whatever places it can. The false pretext of not interfering in other nation's internal affairs is just a gimmick they use to support rogue regime and then reap benefits for themselves. This is the new face of Imperialism.<br>  <br>  British, French and Dutch Imperialism is a thing of the past. Even worse is this new face of Imperialism which is trying to rule by proxy while playing the victim card. Not only the nations you mention, everyone has a moral responsibility to speak out.|`|hrXd7GCLaa	The countries that you mention have every right to voice concerns about Asian imperialism, although you neglect to mention which aspect they are moaning about.<br>  <br>  If you had listed UK, France, Holland, Spain, Germany, as they have all reaped the benefits of Asia in the past, without contributing the same amount back, they have little to complain about it this time.<br>  <br>  As they say what goes around, comes around.|`|oeAUkiq5aa	Asian imperalism obviously failed, cos they left nothing, only "Hungary"---Huns~~just a name.<br>  <br>  Another theory is people who are blood type B are creative but not organized, they invent fast but also disappear fast~~~1/3 Asians are blood type B.<br>  <br>  So i can hardly say this "Asian imperalism" ever existed....nothing left by them.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	These countries obviously have a "clean shirt" and they at no occasion have engaged in even Economic Imperialism like China. They can surely speak out without raising a lot of eyebrows here.|`|MR4WwKoZaa	Did an Asian country invade those countries listed above?  I never heard that news.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about the fact that there are significant immigration from Asia, then it's not called imperialism. <br>  <br>  By definition imperialism is an organized effort by government to subjugate another country, or to assimilate another country and claim as one's own.  Immigration is an individual choice.|`|1LlhqADoaa	the countries you mentioned all are some conservative countries. ,without any conflicts with asia.<br>  What asian countries are doing have nothing to do with them. SO they do not need to moan about anything.
MVVQrEasaa	You haven't said whether you are looking for a house or apartment, and whether you are planning on getting a job that will require a commute into downtown - both things that can affect the choices you make.<br>  <br>  Redmond near Marymoor park could be one choice, Somewhere near the Burke Gilman trail, Greenlake, near the Sammamish trail in Bothell all could be possiblitites.  If you don't mind living further out, Snohomish has the Centennial trail as well that is a nice place.<br>  <br>  But your decisions about what you are comfortable with isn't something we can judge for you - you'll have to do that on your own.  And keep in mind that something you may be comfortable with during daylight will be dark from 4:30 PM - 7AM in the winter months.<br>  <br>  One place to do some more research is a book called "Take a Walk" by Sue Muller Hacking - with descriptions of trails and parks in the greater Seattle area south to Olympia, north to Everett and east to Redmond and Isssaquah.|`|7AxLSwrPaa	I'm sorry I can't be very specific, but I've lived in a suburb of Seattle my entire life, and I know for a fact that there will be something near by to almost anywhere you could choose to live. We've got a LOT of forest and greenery, if you're looking for scenery. And even outside of that, Seattle is an extremely health conscious city and you'll fit in. Everyone jogs, every where haha.|`|pgFD4n1Caa	Most of the places I suggest are in Seattle:<br>  <br>  I guess it really depeds on the distance you are willing to walk and jog.<br>  I live in Ballard and I think it is an ideal place to walk and jog because some areas are hilly for an extra good workout and some are flat depending on which block you turn down. Also it is really residential so there are lots of places to walk and jog and it's all fairly safe. I see families, dog walkers, old and young people running an strolling all the time. I'm talking about closer to the Heritage Museum.  <br>  <br>  Another area that is fairly safe is Queen Anne - closer to the top of the hill. I'm a fan of the residential and if you want a really good workout then I guess you could do actual Queen Anne hill.<br>  <br>  Greenlake is pretty popular but there are parts of the circle that I would nnever do at night because it is pretty dark/in woods and not populated. During the day Greenlake is crazy busy and great. Ideally I like the dusk time.<br>  <br>  Another fairly safe during the day especially on the weekends place is the Arboretum. Walking mostly, I wouldn't run because there are some unpaved areas.  <br>  <br>  I've heard they are going to pave an area around Lake Union - now that would be ideal.

Usually you only get the small coins in each country like 10 or 20 cents & nothing higher.|`|MzqZGvalaa	You can get away with slipping the odd coin in here and there, but these are two different countries, you can't use NZ money in Australia any more than you can use Canadian money in the States.<br>  You used to be able to get away with it in some vending machines, but not anymore.  Also NZ has recently changed some of their coins,so they look a lot more different to Australian ones than they used to, they've scalloped the inside edges and stuff.|`|NzHtbpfJaa	No NZ coins can't be used in Australia - as NZ and Aussie are two separate country's and they have two separate currency's  On saying that you can get the odd NZ coin in change at stores by mistake, but they aren't meant to hand them out.  How do they end up here - people can use 5-10-20 cents coins in parking metres, and coin vending machines etc.... so yeah they do get mixed up.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	Technically no, they are not legal currency. <br>  <br>  But I too receive the odd coin, I tend to use it for machine paying, like parking, vending machines, etc. <br>  <br>  A good old trick, the NZ $1 coin was shaped like our $2 coin, so a vending machine knew no difference. <br>  <br>  I was once given plastic money, when I worked in the TAB at a local racetrack, was not impressed.

I also find a get a few American quarters. I think it's just that they're a similar size and get accepted in error|`|MBlY3pw1aa	the currency is different, with a different exchange rate, so technically no, and the new coins are much smaller and out of place looking than the australian coins|`|IhNJbApCaa	no, not legal tender, I wouldn't except it, the New Zealand dollar is worth far less compared to the Australian Dollar.

A company is not a charity and it has the right to operate in whatever manner brings it the highest return. Thanks to many decades of uncontrolled unionism, coupled in many cases with tariff protection, Australian companies can no longer compete in an open market while using Australian employees - they demand too much money for too little work.<br>  <br>  Perhaps if the Government was to allow substantial tax reductions for companies using Australian labour (a loyalty bonus) it might create some incentive to remain.|`|7RbootLlaa	It all comes down to profit. Due to Australians' habit of wanting material things, like plasma tvs, a huge house and mortgage, flash cars etc. To pay for these items workers are always asking for a pay rise - you see them on the news all the time. Take school teachers and police every year they want more money. So then it sets of a change reaction other workers want a pay rise, because they think their job is more important than teachers and police. Take the car manufacting company workers for example.<br>  <br>  Then you have the little people struggling, like checkout chicks, petrol console operators, garbage collectors, sales assistants etc. We need them all, but then they want a pay rise.<br>  <br>  Ok, so then they get a pay rise. But then the companies have to put up their prices to cover these pay rises and to make a bigger profit than the year before. <br>  <br>  Then there's the problem that no one can afford to buy anything. Cars are way too expensive, cost of food has gone though the roof, greedy oil companies put up their price of fuel which helped push prices on everything else up. Then the banks stepped in and wanted a bigger piece of the cake too and put up their interest rates. They are down now, only because so many businesses and people struggling either went broke or went bankrupt.<br>  <br>  Then no one has any money to buy anything. So the companies are losing profits, workers still want a pay rise, but because the companies are not selling anything, they can not afford to give them any, but then they have to start sacking people because profits are not being made.<br>  <br>  So now the companies are saying, we shall go overseas. The chinese work for as little as $1 an hour. Australians work for say $40 an hour. The chinese don't have unions and don't complain for a pay rise. Australians do. (Don't get me wrong, Unions are useful at times).<br>  <br>  The companies can also employ slave labour like a children as young as 5 years. Australia you can not. The children can be paid $1 A DAY.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, it's all based on greed and profits and everyone no matter what they say, everyone is involved one way or another.<br>  Socialism? It's certainly not working.<br>  <br>  Additional: A Car manufactering plant I think in SA. Sales are down, workers wanted a pay rise, workers were told there may be job loses, but the silly buggers wanted a pay rise anyways. Now there are job loses and they are whinging how they are going to put food on the table?|`|90tPT5nlaa	You can vote for political parties that make it easy for business, in particular in relation to labour laws, payroll taxes etc. And that is all that can be done.

AA11455587	Hey.<br>  I am from Europe and I have been to France recently, Paris. I recommend Perfect Hotel from Montmartre (<a href="http://www.paris-hostel.biz/youth.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.paris-hostel.biz/youth.html).</a> It'a clean, friendly, nice place to stay near Sacre Coeur. It was great. As for the attractions..there are sooo many. you can choos almost anything. I fell in love with Paris. My favourites were Jardin du Luxembourg, George Pompidou, the top of Tour Eiffel.<br>  Last summer I was in Spain. I strongly recommend Barcelona. But I also went to Southern Spain. I stayed in a little town Torremolinos and from there I went to Granda to visit the Alhambra (I loved it). I also took one day trip to Morrocco. You cross Gibraltar and you are on the African continent. So it's great. I was in Tangiers and I liked it.<br>  As for Austria I was in Vienna. I stayed at Hotel Ruthensteiner..but I don't recommend it if you have kids. Once you are there you can find at the hotels maps and brochures with the attractions. I saw some of them and I liked Schonbrunn (of course!) (as a tip: you can order tickets online so it's easier when you arrive there) . And go to Prater to see Ferris Wheel.<br>  I was also in Greece. But I haven't seen much, honestly. I was in Thessaloniki which I liked..it's a nice city and in Halkidiki (because it was summer) but there many other attractions you should see..like Athens!, Meteora, Mount Athos.|`|CBUDrMBvaa	I would recommend Greece I have been there before and it is beautiful.

These will let you see the most signifcant places at least from a distance.
p0INzk2Laa	It's not a matter of nationality.  If a person does not show enough respect for the country he or she is visiting, he or she will also get the same treatment.   As for me I can't stand the Arabs, the Koreans (not all), the French (the older people not the young ones).    The Arabs act like they own the entire world, but so does the Americans.  So it's all the same s**t.   The Koreans sometimes misbehave because they simply are used to this in their own country.  Well, they should learn some manners when they travel.  The older French People, some of them have  lived in former French Colonies and used to some kind of "Slavery", the same concept as colonial times in the Philippines so they are used to getting very good treatment even if they act rudely.   The young French Nationals are quite ok.  I have many friends among them.   The Russians are cool. Even if they are naturally rude (it's part of their culture though), they are still far more respectful to the Philippines than the average American.  Besides, a drunken Russian has more profound things to say than an American with a PhD.  Of course there are exceptions to the rule ;)   <br>  <br>  FYI, in response to ChiliConCarne's answer.   there is no such thing as a BLACK SOVIET CITIZEN!!!

RgHIk4mmaa	It's a loaded question. Americans should absolutely know more about the world around them, but it's actually very difficult for them to learn. The paper and news report exclusively American news, it's maddening. In school Americans are NOT taught world history, geography, or about the rest of the world in general. If they are to learn these things on their own, they are of absolutely no value in most careers. <br>  <br>  The main reason I'm defending them so much is that I've seen intelligent Americans trying to overcome these obstacles as best as they can, but foreigners don't take the obstacles they have to face into account.<br>  <br>  In general, I definitely think Americans need to learn about the rest of the world. But the way to do this isn't to walk up to an American abroad and laugh at them for not being able to find Iraq on a map. If they're abroad in the firast place, it's likely because they're trying to learn about the rest of the world. Humour them, pity them, and try to help them understand.|`|amA9G3Zfaa	The ones that actually do lack knowledge of other countries probably should be, however, that question is a generalization. Not all Americans lack knowledge of other countries, there are a great deal of intelligent people in America who care about the rest of the world. Anywhere in the world you will go, there will ALWAYS be people who lack knowledge of other countries.|`|CNp3okAYaa	well I would say YES, but thinking that there are millions of Americans that don't know much about the other states inside USA you can't expect them to know about the other countries.<br>  USA is a lot of territory states, cultures, people but this is not an excuse for them not to know at least the biggest countries on the globe.<br>  <br>  I am European, I spent almost a year near New York, I made friends there that have never been at age age of 25, or 30 to New York, or Philadelphia, the closest biggest cities in the area?? i was amazed, there are millions of Europeans that would walk those distances just to visit NY, or Philly ...|`|sopPnzC0aa	YES, Brian F is n excellent example of this lack of knowledge- he has been asked about the lack of knowledge of *other countries*, but proceeds to talk about American states and has not realised that this question is about countries other than America.|`|V58rYfEsaa	Yep...I dont know a great deal about the rest of the world BUT I do know that Australia is not the be all and end all of the world as the yanks think of their country.|`|TzlNjkCQaa	No, we should be ashamed of Oprah's pancake habit, the mullet hair cut and having invented the cabbage patch..|`|AA11043094	Yes they should! And I speak as an American. The lack of knowledge  about the rest of the world is shameful.|`|vet4adaYaa	If I were European, I would be ashamed of my rude uneducated countrymen whom are obsessed with the U.S.|`|fv8W4iCnaa	"You should be ashamed you make generalizations and you fellow countrymen are complete disrespectful assholes."<br>  <br>  WELL PUT GOOD SIR.<br>  I'm ashamed all these other countries know NOTHING about us.<br>  They pretend to though.<br>  <br>  I talked politics with French-Canadians once in a bar when I went to Qubec, and even in Canada right next door they have no idea. The only reason they hated George Bush is because they were just agreeing with us. <br>  <br>  So anyways, no, no we shouldn't be ashamed.<br>  We should be ashamed of nothing.<br>  America is the greatest country in the world. <br>  (Debatable but lets be honest, if it's so horrid how come we are a superpower? How come so many from other countries spend their lives just to make it here? Once you look at it from outside a patriotic/nationalist point of view, it's really quite clear.)<br>  We should however work on our education in poor states and cities.<br>  We should enlighten everyone about what's going on in the world, they most certainly should know the basics and issues going on around the world, but life is more than worrying about everyone elses **** when 9/10 times it's not going to affect you in any way shape or form.<br>  <br>  Sorry I'm ranting.<br>  What I'm really trying to say is look in the mirror, and get over yourselves.|`|MzqZGvalaa	I think ashamed is a bit strong, embarrassed maybe?  You know Americans are not the only people who don't know a lot about the rest of the world, I think it may just be becoming another racial stereotype anyway.  I came to Australia from Scotland and was told I speak  good English!! By Australians!  I've been asked if I was English and when I said no Scottish have been told it's 'the same thing'!,  Do the men all wear kilts?  Everyone has preconceived notions of things that invariably turn out to be inaccurate or just plain wrong.  Unlike other countries they are not exposed to foreign television shows, which show a little of other countries culture, admittedly somewhat askew, but it's there nonetheless, they only really see US TV.  It's not taught at their schools much either, so it's not really their fault.  Lay of the American bashing, it's getting old.   We all know all their faults and continually pointing them out doesn't seem to be helping.<br>  *And to all the Brian F knockers if you check the map you'll see he is in fact correct- the United States isn't the whole of North America, he's right the continent of North America has 3 countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Count them.  Three.<br>  *people are so quick to point out the bad and forget about the good, like sending Elvis the Big Helicopter (sounds like something from Thomas the Tank Engine ha ha) to help with our bush fires, they're always a big presence at any natural disaster lending machinery and a helping hand.  Everyone knows they're a little pompous, but if you're objective you can see that they're not all bad.  They're not the Big Devil or whatever.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	We are not surrounded on the same continent by other countries. So we are not exposed on a daily basis. There is little opportunity to be around other nationals, unless you live in or near a big city. We don't really need to learn more than English, although it is required to graduate from secondary school. Generally, because we are a mix here, it is easier, safer, to blend into something common to all.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	I think ashamed is a rather strong word. Being ashamed means feeling inferior or unworthy. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, "Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent."<br>  <br>  Also, I would like to add that there is a North America and South America. People frequently refer to North America exclusively when they speak of Americans although technically persons from South America could be called Americans too.<br>  <br>  Being knowledgeable of other countries is especially useful if you plan on traveling, working in international relations, public policy, or in some other capacity for the government. But, if you think about it does it really matter if a person that has never left their country knows the capital of a country that is thousands of miles away? I mean if they're not planning on going there who cares?<br>  <br>  Although I am finishing a master's degree I believe in learning things that are practical. Knowledge of the world is practical for some but not all.|`|f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	Only as far as the europeans are ashamed of their lack of understanding of the size and scope of the US.

Law wise, its just like any other place.<br>  The speed limit on the Interstate is 65 MPH or 75 MPH depending on how rural the area is.  Most county roads are 45 MPH or 50 MPH, with state highways up to 65 MPH.  In some areas cops do patrol heavily so just try to pay attention to speed limit signs.<br>  I've lived near Meridian, what do you specifically want to know about it?|`|7uffHRdkaa	I've never been to Idaho, so I couldn't tell you exactly what the speed limit is, but I'd imagine, assuming the roads are straight and not to slantly in the mountains, it'd probably be 60-65 MPH. You'll see signs up there. Just drive a little slower than those pacing on the road until you see signs, because people will always try to drive faster than what the speed limit is. As to what the other guy said, when I read that, I just laughed lol Sadly, he's probably right. I'd think it's probably boring though.

It has three mosques, free Wi-Fi, a large duty-free area, a few eateries and 44 airline stands. There are also 60 check in gates, 5 baggage claim belts and over 1,000 car parking spaces.<br>  <br>  The airport suffers from over capacity even though the airport has been expanded numerous times. The current capacity stands at 12 million passengers per year. Its 15,000 ft. runway is one of the longest at a civil airport. It is the main base of Qatar Airways. In the past, the airport was mostly used by Qatari Holiday makers and foreign workers coming for the oil and gas sector. Now the airport is attracting more people such as holiday makers and transit travelers, it is also growing as Qatar Airways is expanding more rapidly. British Airways used to operate Concordes on the route.<br>  <br>  The existing airport will be replaced in late 2009 or early 2010 when the first phase of New Doha International Airport is expected to open.<br>  <br>  The airport is currently ranked as a 3 star by skytrax along with 7 other airports

Ssn0ojAGaa	Anybody that will judge you by your accent is an idiot on not worth the time of day. If your accent points out who those idiots are, it saves you time in the long run. Because you won't be wasting your time with a person who judges a book by its cover. I have a friend here in Ireland and one of her parents grew up in America. My friend has grown up in Ireland all their life but has an unusual accent because she picked it off one of their parents (American accent) growing up. It is a mix of Irish accent and American. It sounds quite unusual. Nobody ever came up to us in a pub and insulted her for it. Her accent is fabulous in my opinion because it is part of who she is. She is very confident, intelligent and pretty. So if somebody did insult her, she would be well able to stand up for herself. I would pity the fool on the receiving end. She would have them in tears. She considers herself very much Irish.<br>  <br>  You should not be ashamed of your accent. It is part of who you are. You decide who you are. Not your accent and not other people. Do not try and change your natural accent. If you pick up a few slang words grand. But do purposely go out of your way to change it. People will figure it out. You cannot use a fake accent with your housemates.<br>  <br>  Some of my Limerick flatmates (posher Limerick, I from posh Culchie Cork) use to laugh at how I pronounced kettle. But not in a mean way. Like a friendly way. They use say tackies for sneakers and I thought that was funny.<br>  <br>  Your parents are Irish, you have the right to say you are Irish.<br>  <br>  And there is nothing wrong with taking pride in the Irish Flag.<br>  It is a symbol of peace. <br>  Look it up what colours stand for.<br>  There are variations in the wording do.<br>  <br>  Some say Catholic stands green, Orange for protestants, white peace.<br>  Or Green Nationalist, Orange British supporters, white peace.<br>  Important to note that some famous Irish Protestants fought for Ireland.<br>  So that is probably where the variations lie.<br>  White always stands for peace, non-the less.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and have fun.|`|SWxcuGlOaa	Shane McGowan has an English accent but lord knows everyone loves him, have you ever heard of Des Bishop?<br>  <br>  lol|`|a6JNx1tgaa	Okay... here's the thing. I just saw an answer of yours claiming that there are bombs going off in Belfast every day. I mean, if you have that kind of distorted perception of the North I doubt your perception of the Republic is any better, even if you did live here as a kid. (If you'd been older when you lived here, you'd know better than to make such a ridiculous statement.) Are you really proud of being Irish American or are you proud of what you THINK it means to be Irish American? <br>  <br>  With regard to the term "Irish American", because your dad and grandparents are Irish you're an actual Irish American, not one of the John McCain style bullshitters and you should be proud of your heritage - American included. There might be things about being American that you don't like, but rest assured there are plenty of things about being Irish that I don't like but I'm still proud of where I come from.<br>  <br>  Let's say you do move here for college. It's going to be different to how you think it is, even if you did live here when you were younger. I don't  really know what you mean by "act Irish", but don't feel like you should be anyone other than your Irish American self because people will know you're putting on an act. Over time, you'll naturally adjust to things. Same thing with the accent; don't force it. You might get a bit of a twang and start using Irish slang but it's doubtful you'd ever speak with a full Irish accent. If you've lived here for a while, it's inevitable that your accent will change a little. It pretty much happens to everyone who moves here. You won't look stupid unless you're putting it on.<br>  <br>  A way of "proving" your Irishness would be learning to speak the language. Not by any means necessary, but it might help you feel a bit more confident and most Irish people are fairly impressed by people who didn't grow up here who can speak it. Heck,  not that many of us even speak it to begin with so you'd have a leg up on a lot of people.<br>  <br>  Good luck ^_^|`|7oA361fbaa	Words fail me.|`|zVGhHomRaa	Everyone likes an American in France. <br>  <br>  I'm French-American.|`|3Tlq60FTaa	Hey John,<br>  <br>  Were you born in Ireland? I don't understand why you feel disgusted with yourself. I think you're lucky to be Irish American. Nobody will think you look like a fool trying to act irish. You don't have to act anything, just be yourself and be happy with who you are. People will accept you for you. Be proud of Ireland and America. For they are both part of you. <br>  <br>  I've been living in Ireland my whole life, i'm 26 and there's nothing so great about it. Relax John you're only 17. You shouldn't be worrying about this at all. <br>  <br>  Wow i would love to move to America, you are lucky !!!|`|OyBuEpOTaa	I am 1st generation but was ashamed of my parents for being forieners in the US. As I grew older and began to apppreciate myself for what I am I embraced my parents nationality. However now I wish they had raised me in their country. My dad wasn't totaly happy in the states, but he always was appriciative. When he and his firends raised their glasses they always shouted "for America" He moved back to the old country when he retired, and still displayed the American flag. He always said "a man without a flag is not a man." He made his choise.<br>  As for accents..well he was a real treat. He had a good command of the English language, but spoke with a heavy accent. When he returned to the old country his mother tongue had an English accent. He spoke niether language perfectly. We teased that spoke nothing well. <br>  <br>  You are caught between two countries. This is the quandry we all find ourselves in when we travel, or are first generation. You may find that nowhere is home, if you relocate to ireland. America is part of you, and so is Ireland. Once you learn to appreciate yourself for who you are, your opnion like my own, will change. You don't need an accent to fit in. In fact once you learn to speak Gaelic, you'll speak it well, especially if you grew up bi-lingual or at least heard it a lot. People are so mobile now, you may have to learn more languages. Europeans do.<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped. you should do a little research before you go, and never burn your bridges behind you. People will be curious about you, so you'll have friends.|`|AA11119758	You should be disgusted with yourself-what fooking difference does it make where you grew up?

You'd loose your West Coast accent soon enough if you came over here, and stayed over here for the duration of your course.<br>  <br>  As for being ashamed for being Irish-American - nothing wrong with that, your accent would be regarded as "cute" by all those silly (but by no means stupid) college girls!|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	You are really that obsessed with nationality?You need to get over this and start living your life.

Race/nationality is not the measure of a person.<br>  <br>  You seem to have rose colored glasses on in regard to Ireland. 17 is a bit old for this sort of thing. Ireland/the irish are very nice, but not exactly perfect. No more so than Americans, French, Italians....Perhaps learn more about the history (in depth) of both countries and get a grip.

If the saving fares for 2nd class should be sold out I recommend to check the saving fare availability in first class since the 1st class saving fare tickets (€29.00 or €49.00) are still cheaper than the regular priced 2nd class ticket.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It's not dangerous at all; in fact, it's exactly what is supposed to happen.<br>  <br>  The parts on the edge of the wing that you see "flapping" are in fact being moved deliberately by the pilots or the onboard computers, in order to adjust the path of the airplane in reaction to minor gusts of wind and the like.  These movements keep the aircraft flying on course and at the right altitude within very tight tolerances.  There are hydraulic actuators inside the wing that move these. These same parts of the wing are moved a bit more briskly when it is necessary to turn the aircraft.<br>  <br>  In cruise flight, for small adjustments, you'll see mostly these inboard surfaces moving.  For larger adjustments, you may notice similar surfaces moving towards the outside edge of the wings.  And prior to landing, you'll see the rear edge of the wing extend its way outward to improve lift at low speeds.  All of this is totally, completely normal.<br>  <br>  United Airlines has 56,000 employees, so a layoff of 300 mechanics doesn't have much of an impact on the airline (although it has quite an impact on the people who lose their jobs).|`|fZjgIE9Baa	A Boeing 777's wings can move 8 ft up and down without causing any structural damage to the aircraft|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Flaps just used during takeoff and landing - Nothing to worry about|`|DDsZ3ud8aa	Nothing to worry about, this is normal.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	No worries. The wing is designed the BE, VERY flexible. A long time ago, early 60's, a plane crashed a quarter mile from where my family lived in rural Illinois, about 50 miles west of Chicago. Later, MUCH later, I found out it was an Electra 225 and it came down a few yards short of a house where a family of 8 lived on a farm raising corn, our nearest neighbor to the south. Big fire, all the things you would associate with an aircraft dropping out of the sky. It came down about 3 AM .give or take and it made a LOT of noise. It woke my family and we all went out to see what was burning in the corn field just south of our house. It was bad, VERY bad. The smell of burning flesh is simply horrible and I sincerely hope I NEVER experience that oder again. Anyway, that was right around 1960 give or take a year or two. Long about 1970 or so, they made a movie about this particular aircraft, the Electra 225. I forget the title. Jimmy Stewart was the lead. It was the story of how the character played by Jimmy Stewart finally realized it was metal fatigue which caused the tail assembly to literally break off in flight causing a crash. What he found was a vibration which flexed the tail assembly at a certain speed in flight, which happened to be the standard cruising speed and altitude of the flights that crashed. Thus, saving the day by strengthening the tail assembly support structure to prevent a sympathetic vibration from happening which was the root cause of the metal fatigue which caused the tail to break off. You know what metal fatigue is. It is also called "work hardening". As you flex a piece of metal, MOST work hardens. The internal crystal structure changes, causing the metal to become brittle instead of flexible. The more times you flex the metal the harder and more brittle it becomes. You can demonstrate this for yourself. If you unbend a paper clip and start bending the wire back and forth. Sooner or later, the flex point will harden and finally will totally crack through like glass instead of bending. THAT is an example of work hardening. You WANT that wing to flex. REALLY, you DO want the wing to flex. It is when it STOPS that you are in for a catastrophic failure. This has nothing to do with the number of mechanics. This kind of damage, work hardening, is totally invisible just as it is in the paper clip until it fractures instead of bending. However, JUST before it fails, it does get micro-cracks which ARE detectable simply by knocking on the metal surface and listening to the SOUND it makes. And then, actual visible cracks begin to show and finally, it simply fails completely. At the time in the life-cycle when cracks can be detected, the metal is at 99% of the total life and 1% away from total failure. It is standard for airplanes to be retired at 1/2 or less than the point where actual cracks start to appear and could be seen visually. Bottom line, NO WORRIES about a wing flexing many feet at the tip as it encounters differing pressures which are NORMAL in flight through air. There are ripples in air exactly like there are ripples in water. You will see this effect more near an airport than anywhere else because of the vortexes left behind from a wing from another aircraft moving through the same air space. Like in water when you throw a stone which leaves ripples, aircraft leave an equivalent ripple in the air after passing through. The name for this is turbulence which you will commonly encounter near an airport when either taking off or landing. In the higher atmosphere, it is the same, ripples in the air, but the high atmosphere effect is caused by the movement of the air from the local weather instead of another aircraft.|`|wNZ95AK3aa	perfectly normal nothing to worry about.flaps are only used for landing and take off|`|AA11471769	How the heck do you fly if you dont flap your wings?

Maybe you're doing something wrong in approaching people, especially if you make a point of "meeting women for dating."  That right there sounds awkward at best because it sounds as if you don't even allow a woman a choice in the matter.  Women don't like to be treated like a piece of meat to be selected from the refrigerator.  You meet people in the course of your life, and if there's mutual interest, that's when you start dating.  "Shot down viciously" indicates that you have gotten some pretty negative responses.  Don't blame it on Wisconsin-- people don't react like that unless you do something wrong.
j1Yae2q9aa	I hear that Jappleng will be offering the "Travel" section in April or May but that's probably a little too close to when you're going to Japan.  Alternatively you can also use <a href="http://eventful.com/tokyo/events?c=music&sort_order=Popularity" rel="nofollow">http://eventful.com/tokyo/events?c=music...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
CUMdhfKzaa	It's definitely possible.  Banks are private companies that want business.  Some banks in Japan even have English available on their bank machines.<br>  <br>  Assuming your Japanese is bad, just make sure you open an account at a major bank in a major city's downtown.  If possible, get a Japanese to come with you.<br>  <br>  You can also open up an account at the post office.  All post offices in Japan also have banking services.  It might sound weird, but you can have your bank account at your local post office.<br>  <br>  The benefit of the post office is you don't need a "hanko".  Most banks will require that you do.  A hanko is a personalized stamp that is used the same way that we use signatures in the West.  So, if you want an account at a bank, you're going to have to get one made.<br>  <br>  Lesson from the past:  Before you plan on leaving Japan, give yourself lots of time to close your account before you leave.  I did mine last minute.  They closed my account, but instead of transfering the thousands of dollars worth of funds, they had to give it to me in cash.|`|eAMbWkahaa	Yes it is very much possible.  Even those living in Japan as students can get accounts.  Most people except "tourists" can get an account.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Drop in any JP-Bank near you with your passport(which shows your one year visa) and/or alien card. You will soon be able to open your bank account instantly. You'd better take your own Hanko seal to open the account, too.

There are limitations to how far you can go and how much you can carry with you. It is a great way to see some of the countryside though if you're in shape to do it. <br>  <br>  For the distances you're talking about, the train system is the best tradeoff for most people. <a href="http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en" rel="nofollow">http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en</a> , <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en_EN/flash/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sncf.com/en_EN/flash/</a> The trains are generally an excellent way to get around here.<br>  <br>  There are also buses. <a href="http://www.eurolines.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurolines.com/</a>

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	First, ignore the answer which claimed that the Act of Union was brought about by a Scottish King. NOT TRUE (but then the English education system has long lagged behind that of Scotland). The Act of Union was bought about by a GERMAN monarch. (The Act of Union dates from 1707)<br>  <br>  Secondly, why is it that whenever the question of independence for Scotland is raised, it is ENGLISH politicans that oppose it? Because they know that without Scotland, England CANNOT survive economically. <br>  <br>  The Scottish electorate have voted in a Scottish Natonal Party government. All Scottish by-elections to Westminster show a surge in support for the Scottish National Party. Remember Glasgow East - hitherto one of the safest seat for Labour - now held by the Nationalists!<br>  <br>  The SOONER Scotland regains its independence from the arrogant, greedy, self-centered English - THE BETTER|`|6aw3naCNaa	Hey<br>  <br>  Well ur obviously an American cos you dont know what your talking about lol<br>  <br>  Im Scottish- but Im also very proud to be British<br>  <br>  If we wanted to "run" ourselves, we would<br>  <br>  We have our own Goverment, Parliment, Laws etc but we'r also a very British country and Im happy for it to stay that way.<br>  <br>  I have no problems with England.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	Luckily the whole world will always be able to unite in our dislike of ignorant Americans such as this one who have no idea about anything beyond their own borders and think that everything they do is right and best.<br>  <br>  A) The fact that you can't spell 'British' suggests that you actually have no idea how the British government works.<br>  <br>  B) The British never owned 'most African countries', only most of South africa and a few other small areas on the West coast. Most was oned by the French, Dutch and Germans.<br>  <br>  C) England does not own Scotland, the two countries are united due to the act of Union and, together with Wales and Northern Ireland, make up Britain. Scottish people are British.|`|YwdFUCQtaa	Whilst agreeing wholeheartedly with the previous poster regarding your general level of knowledge about anything at all outside the US of A, I would say that yes, actually I'm English and think that it would be a very good idea if Scotland became fully independent, especially financially. Good luck with your banking system, guys!|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	England was once a series of kingdoms that united in the first millennium.  The union with scotland came much later.|`|jUdGNUUNaa	The Scottish Independents need to break free from their hatred of the English. Even their Regional Anthem 'Flower Of Scotland' defines Scotland in terms of hating the English. <br>  <br>  Both regions of the UK are intertwined beyond recognition, with more 'Scots' living outside of Scotland than in it. What would happen to all the 'Scots' living outside of Scotland? They would have to be repatriated, at least in the short term until their status was sorted out. Can you imagine the chaos?<br>  <br>  The SNP needs to admit that the UK needs Scotland and Scotland needs the UK.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I would also like to point out that calling all English people arrogant is racist and stereotyping, just like Fiona's answer, which deserves to be removed.|`|VFRXrlDVaa	Hahaha.<br>  <br>  Mr Arrogant,<br>  <br>  1) What do you think America is doing? Walking into any old country and taking them over.<br>  <br>  2) Their weren't white people in America before the British. So you're actually accusing yourself of taking over a country. Yes, you took over you're country from Indians.<br>  <br>  3) The British legal system is great. It actually works. Not all this American bullshit you guys seem to have.<br>  <br>  You say, "they shouldn't have to answer to the British" Well guess what mate, they are the British. Britain is England, Scotland and Wales.<br>  <br>  Get some general knowledge before you go spouting your ideas round.|`|DdNAqWulaa	you do know that the British Prime Minister is Scottish don't you -  and that the party in power in Westminster have more seats in Scotland than the opposition|`|Ou7j5QxZaa	Scotland was conquered by England?<br>  <br>  What was England conquered by?<br>  <br>  England wasn't always England.|`|RGEsfb5waa	well, the fact that the Act of Union, creating the Kingdom of Britain, and thus Joining Scotland, England and Wales together was brought about by a SCOTTISH king, and was a joint decision by the countries  Parliaments, it kind of says the English didn't exactly conquer them<br>  <br>  The Scottish do have their own Parliament as do Wales, but the English don't. The Welsh get free Medical prescriptions, paid for by English Tax payers, but the English don't get that, and the Scottish get free University education for themselves, paid for by the English Tax payer, but the English don't get that. <br>  <br>  The Scottish and Welsh can vote and have a say on English Political matters, but the English can't have a say in Welsh or Scottish matters. Does it seem fair? no it doesn't. Basically the English are treated as Second class citizens in their own country while the Scottish and Welsh seem to receive numerous benefits at the English expense.<br>  <br>  To be honest, they have it pretty good, but they can vote to leave at any time, they just need to bring about a referendum, yet they don't because the majority of people are pro Union rather than pro independence. As a union we are financially better off and have more of a say in world politics. On our own as individual countries, we won't have as much influence<br>  <br>  Basically the Union benefits us all in some way or another, and I think you should learn more in the way of facts before you come on here and shove your nose into business that is not yours. Do we tell you how your country should be run?<br>  <br>  On a separate note, the Colinisation of other countries and the Empire was by the BRITISH, not just the ENGLISH. Therefore Scotland was involved in that, because yes, shockingly enough, The Scottish are British, since guess what, they are located on the Island of Great Britian.

DHMoBx5haa	Unfortunately with the economy like it is at the moment, you may just have to take work where you can find it. If you settle on any given town, chances are low that you're going to get a job there in your specialty.<br>  <br>  Most houses in New Zealand come with good back yards. In the cities they're starting to build without any space out back, but there's still plenty out there built sensibly.<br>  <br>  Moving to NZ is difficult, immigration are a painful department to deal with by all accounts. The best advice I'd give is to setup in Wellington or maybe Hamilton until you've got everything sorted then find a job in a nice quiet town. You'd have a better chance at getting a job, and I understand that they take points off if you want to live in Auckland (why anyone does is beyond me and most other people!)|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Wellington A beautiful city in Good weather .

74788eec30ee6b40ea78647eff430315aa	Also mir f?llt zu meinen Marrakesch-Erlebnissen als erstes und sehr sch?nes Erlebnis der Platz der Gaukler ein. Pa? auf, wenn du dort zu fotografieren beabsichtigst - Schlangenbeschw?rer, Schellenm?nner, Affendressuren - diese Leute wollen Unmengen an Geld, dafür dass du sie fotografieren darfst, bis 20 Euro pro Bild haben wir erlebt!!!<br>  In den Soukhs, also den G?sschen rund um den Platz, ist es wundersch?n zu bummeln. Wenn du gern handelst, bist du da richtig auf der Suche nach netten Mitbringseln.<br>  Ansonsten haben wir in Marrakesch die Sadier-Gr?ber besichtigt, was ich auch sehr interessant fand, und den alten Palast angesehen. Die Stadt hat auch sehr sch?ne Gartenanlagen, die zu einem Spaziergang einladen.<br>  Also dann viel Spass und sch?ne Erlebnisse in Marrakesch!|`|a61bcc736a820260594449f3433f8cdbaa	War leider nicht in Marrakesch, nur in Casablanca und Safi. Mein Eindruck war, dass nicht besonders viel Interessantes geboten ist. Casablanca ging ja noch, aber Safi war absolut tote Hose. Interessant ist sicher die marrokanische Baukunst allgemein und beim Besuch von Moscheen sind die Schuhe auszuziehen.<br>  <br>  Insgesamt hat Marrokko einen ziemlich heruntergekommenen Eindruck auf mich gemacht und hammerhart fand ich die Tatsache, dass man in Casablanca einen Toten in einen Teppich gewickelt, einfach auf die Stra?e vor die Tür gelegt hat, damit er abgeholt wird.<br>  <br>  Ich hoffe, dass dich mehr positive Eindrücke erwarten und wünsche Gute Reise!|`|1b5fde7095b1104f6ba132fc2b516c99aa	War nicht in der Innenstadt. Wuerde dir aber einen Fuehrer empfehlen. Nicht das es gefaehrlich sei, nein, nur das Du wieder herausfindest. Ich persoenlich hatte immer ein paar kleine Geldscheine griffbereit, so das Ich nicht and die groesseren Scheine musste, wenn ich etwas kleines kaufen moechte. Einen Geldbeutel empfehle Ich dir nicht. Hatte immer eine kleinen flachen Beutel mit Klettenband im Hosenbund. So konnte Ich den Beutel immer auf die jeweilige Hose kletten. Darin hatte Ich die groesseren Scheine und meinen Personal Ausweis. Der ist klein genug. Zur meiner Zeit war der Reisepaas ein riesiger Lappen.<br>  Fliegst am Samstag. Da hast Du noch Zeit dir einen Leihwagen zu mieten. Musst unbedingt mit dem Auto in das Atlas Gebirge. Bin schon mehrere Male durch Marocco mit dem Auto geduest. Lass dich auf keine Hassler ein. Der Knabe mit der Uniform ist der Boss. Falls Du mal ne rote Ampel ueberfaehrts, spreche kein Franzoesisch oder Arabisch.Kein Englisch ebenfalls. Sei nett und hilfreich und spreche am besten nur tief Schwaebisch. Haha. So hat mich mal ein Gendarm in Casablanca weiter fahren lassen. Lass dich nicht mit Alkohol am Steuer erwischen. Speziell bei einem Unfall. Dann kannst Du nur noch beten.<br>  Da gibt es einige Maroccanische Fussballer die in Deutschland spielen. Mache dir die Namen gelaeufig. Klar, Beckenbauer solltest du natuerlich kennen.<br>  Ein sehr Gastfreundliches Land. Es gibt auch sehr viele Arme Menschen dort. Als Ich vor 20 Jahren dort war , hatten alle zu Essen. Die Polizei ist Knallhart. Wie gesagt, Fussball hilft dir die Wogen zu glaetten. Lass dich nicht in die Politik ein und wenn die ueber Ihren Herrscher sprechen ,nun ja was auch immer.<br>  Bei Arabern ist es nicht hoeflich die linke Hand zu benutzen, weil damit das Gesaess gereinigt wird. Esse mit der rechten Hand.<br>  Manchmal wirst Du sehen , dass zwei Maenner hand in hand gehen. Die sind nicht Schwul. Das ist so ueblich in Arabischen Laendern. Will dir jemand etwas zeigen, nimmt Er dich bei der Hand. Da gibt es natuerlich Klassenunterschiede. Du laesst dich natuerlich nicht von jedem Anfassen.<br>  Mit den Maedles. Klar, die sind scharf wie Rettich. Falls Du alleine reist, werden die dich in der Disco auflauern. Bedenke, einen one night stand ist fast so als Heirates Du das Maedel. Nicht so das Du Verheiratet wirst. Nein, die Damen sind schon ziemlich abgezockt und die lassen Ihren Goldfisch nicht mehr aus den Augen. Das kann dir den Urlaub versauen. Bin nicht fuer Sex Tourismus.<br>  Falls Du dir einen Teppich kaufst. Du hast massig Zeit und am Ende deiner Reise kannst Du dich immer noch dafuer entscheiden. Wir lebten einmal in einem Hotel in Tunesien und die hatten so ne Weberei im Hinterhof. Wir kauften einige Teppiche dort. Die verschicken diese nach Deutschland mit all den Zollpapieren. Bin sicher das Du dasselbe in Marocco findest.<br>  <br>  Manchmal ist es gut , diese feucht Toiletten papier klein Packungen dabei zuhaben. Wenn nicht, die Linke.<br>  <br>  Hab viel Spass

If you are that secretive in the rest of your life you will be lonely in London whatever you do.

Once you get older you probably wont like the hustle and bustle of this great city, but while you are young you'll have everything you like on your doorstep.

Do you work in an industry that exists in London and are your skills transferable.  is there a possibility of a transfer from your existing job to one in London.  Do you have a fallback plan if it doesn't work out (family you can stay with etc.)?  For renting in London you need a months rent as well as a month in advance deposit.  If you're not working you'll need someone to act as guarantor to ensure the rent gets paid.  Best bet would be to apply for jobs in advance and travel down to attend interviews and get a job lined up first - all can follow after that.|`|KQpT68AKaa	Don't generalise. To label London as horrible is the statement of somebody who knows very little about the place. For sure, some areas are horrible but, conversely, some areas are very nice. You just have to be careful which area you move to.

XGsuxRR2aa	No, but most airlines will accommodate special requirements as this for a small fee, which will provide your mom with in flight oxygen.<br>  <br>  When not though, you would need to have a unit such as an oxygen concentrator for travel.<br>  <br>  And full tanks are dangerous to transport, so the airline will not transport them, unless they are empty (which defeats the point), so if you wanted to use tanks (if an oxygen concentrator wouldn't do the job), you would need to arrange for them at your destination.<br>  <br>  If in doubt, call the airline to ask about how they can accommodate you, but you will not be able to carry filled tanks on board.|`|6ya0nYR2aa	I would have thought almost certainly not.<br>  Oxygen is explosive and in a pressurised container would definately not be allowed.<br>  I may be wrong but I doubt it.<br>  If the container is FAA approved and you have a Doctor's letter and you contact the airline well in advance you may get approval but there is no guarantee.|`|47X2zoSaaa	Most don't because the oxygen can blow up during the flight|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Yes, they do, as long as you abide by certain restrictions. Any pressurized container is a potential explosive hazard. Not in the manner of something like dynamite or TNT, but rather more like a balloon that pops. With a tank, it is likely that IF the valve head is hit hard enough, it can literally break off and the small hole with high pressure gas behind it, will turn the tank into a high speed projectile. Watch Mythbusters. They did this with a standard size nitrogen tank, the kind that is about a foot in diameter and five feet tall. A cylinder that size was capable of punching a hole in a concrete wall made from cinder blocks. Even a small tank like this used as you say, can do a great amount of damage and if it hit a person could cause death so I think you can understand why the airline would be concerned about how these tanks are handled. So, they will require that certain precautions be observed to prevent this kind of accident from happening. The problem comes from the pressure differential. By being in a plane, effectively you go up to about 8000 feet and they maintain that pressure while the pressure outside goes MUCH lower as you climb to a cruising altitude of 35000 feet. Here is a formula I found somewhere for determining air pressure at altitude. It is only APPROXIMATE, but it is close. Elevation is in FEET and pressure is in Pounds per Square Inch, PSI.<br>  <br>  Elevation - 361 = A<br>  55,906 - A = B<br>  55,906 + A = C<br>  B/C = D<br>  D * 14.55 = Atmospheric pressure<br>  <br>  Another way to look at the formula is:<br>  (56,267 - elevation)/(55,545 + elevation) * 14.55 = Atmospheric pressure.<br>  <br>  I think I got this from the documentation I have for a watch with a built-in pressure sensor which shows altitude when climbing and depth if diving.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the higher the pressure differential, the more potential energy will be released if the tank suffers a catastrophic failure. The tank will NOT explode because the pressure in the aircraft is less than sea level. It will not explode even if exposed to the outside pressure at 35000 feet, though at that high an altitude, your lungs no longer work because of the low pressure without help, which is why those masks drop. Remember, put YOURS on FIRST before you help someone else put on THEIRS...|`|wNZ95AK3aa	it totally depends on the airline.a lot of airlines will have the oxygen organised for you on board.you need to contact your airline and see what there restrictions are on it.before you travel you will have to pre-book it so dont leave it to the last minute

Although people in the Air Force will probably disagree ha ha, there's a fair bit of rivalry and the Air Force thinks it's 'smarter' than the Army.    My first love was a Cambodian Man (Pebbles, if you're out there, I've never forgotten you, you know what they say about first love, sticks) who was in the Air Force in 1982 and he was just one of the boys, treated just like everyone else.  Except by me, nudge nudge wink wink!  He was posted when we still together and I was too young to up and go as well, I cried and cried ;(<br>  * just a thought, the Air Force is less 'brutal' and 'macho' than the Army, and maybe there is something in the 'smarter' thing as well, have you thought about the Air Force.  They certainly get less bad press, if that's anything to go by.  Just a thought.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	No need to go insulting. People are racist because they're f'd in the head, no other reason. Your back lash shows your racism. <br>  <br>  You are Australian, you can join the Australian army, Australia is not one culture it is many, you won't be the only non caucasian i can assure you.

The Eureka is the newest one and offers views of the bay more so than Rialto. The Rialto is more for the city skyline, the Eureka is an overall look of everything outside the city as well. It also has a glass box you can walk out to that comes off the side of the building. Though it is overated and not neccessary. I would take Eureka.

E arrivato a londra volevo cambiare casa, per puro caso mi è sfortunatamente capitata un altro tizio facente le veci di agenzia ungherese e come volevasi dimostrare le accomodazioni fan schifo!<br>  E io ne ho viste tante di case per potermi trasferire al piu presto!Quindi se prendi un contatto da quel sito(ben fornito) chiedi sempre se stai contrattando con un agenzia o no!<br>  Le case(condivise) migliori sono quelle che stanno nella zona 2 o 3(per qualità/prezzo), le zone sono le fasce concentriche di londra, piu sei all'esterno e piu paghi i mezzi pubblici.
