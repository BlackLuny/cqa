Cobain:  Gifted songwriter, depressed and troubled person with a bad addiction, and stuck dealing with fame he never wanted.  Commited suicide.   Sad that people get to that state, but it happens, a lot.  Deal with it.      MQ-  With sales for In Utero barely reaching the halfway mark of Neverminds... where do you think NIrvana would be today had Kurt not commited suicide?    Would they have rebounded, or just levelled off ( cause for all you kiddies that weren't around then, their fame HAD peaked already, though that is not saying that they weren't still popular.  But his suicide spiked the bands popularity through the roof)?      (and this is not being said to make fun of the guy asking if he should bite the JBs head off.  I actually would rather enjoy that, though one of the answers did remind me of the recent plague of people who really needed to get out more)

It's a male singer, and all I remember is "beyond your front door" and "I made you say underwear"(or something very similar to that"      I know these are really crappy details, but I just heard it on scrubs, but I couldn't really hear the lyrics because they were talking over it.

Open to suggestions as long as they're exciting. Nothing boring or things i've probably done before. Preferably things that I can do as a date, but don't have to be. Groups or by myself, whichever. Don't care if they're slightly illegal (as long as not a felony, lol). Thanks in advance!   I live in CT, and and actually 19 (just said 18 to make things simpler) but i've done all the stuff you can do when you turn 18 already. Im just looking for something that's a major thrill, im getting bored with the same old, same old..   Basically, stuff that will get my (and her) adrenaline pumping would be awesome. (Cliffdiving, rockclimbing, snowboarding, etc. but new original stuff..)

20090307083739AAr09u1	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you do when you have a teacher you can absolutely NOT bear?	There's an awful teacher for one of my community college classes and it's driving me crazy. Her background and the class apparently bring up a lot of hate issues, and she definitely demonstrates this hate. She is angry all the time. She repeatedly tells us what a good teacher she is--therefore, we should accept it when she calls us out in class and treats us like children.      I have taken many classes in many different areas and have a good GPA. So, I know I'm not just complaining for no reason; this woman is an awful teacher. We don't learn anything, and she gives all good grades--after multiply berating us. I'm guessing this latter fact is so we can't technically complain.      Have you ever had a class like this? I don't have the option of dropping; (I need to graduate).

20090307082856AAfXSRq	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Was Watchmen less inappropriate than people said, or am I just mature movie-watcher?	I'm a 13 year old boy and last night I saw Watchmen with my dad. While we were waiting for it to start, this young lady was complaining to the manager and workers that the movies should've been NC-17, and that they wanted a refund. After that, she walked up to my dad and said that the movie really isn't meant for me. We saw it anyway and I could understand how it was rated R, what with the nonstop violence that had blood and gore in it. I turned away around 5 times during it, and there was just ONE part where I ALMOST screamed. Yet, this movie still wasn't enough to brainwash me or give me a nightmare. So, am I just mature with these kinds of movies?

Okay, what happens, is sometimes (not always) when I practice flute, my left hand gets sore right below my pointer finger.  It gets reddish/pink and looks shiny and is soft and weird!!! This happens after I practice for about 20-40 minutes.  It is really sore, and goes away after about 5 minutes if I take a break from practicing, but it gets annoying.   Thanks!   PS the spot that hurts is about the size of a dime, and is at the spot where my pointer finger meets my palm.   And I don't think I am griping the flute to hard, because it is on my palm, not fingers, which is what you hold the flute with!

20090227134114AAn1S3k	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What does this dream mean?	Ok....well I just woke up and this dream scared the crap out of me.      I was sitting in the back seat of this big SUV. The one behind the front passenger seat.... My half sister was sitting beside me in a carseat. (shes like 14 now lol) and her mom Melanie was in the driver seat. The setting was placed at my Great Grandpa's house down at the Lake of the Ozarks. Well, his neighbor has this dock, that's been abandoned/unmaintained for awhile..its falling apart, and pretty rickety. We were parked in front of the long pathway that you walk on to get to the dock. Melanie was like "are you ready?"...well she drove onto the pathway. (i thought it would break)...broke through the wood dock and we landed in the lake. We floated for awhile. Melanie said "ok now we have to find a spot in the line. And there were all these cars lined up (floating on the lake), waiting to drown themselves. Well we floated right into an opening of the line. It was soon before it was our turn. Melanie cracked the windows a lil bit and the water started flowing in. I reached into my pockets (as if something in there would make me want to not die)...all i felt was cigarettes and my cell phone. I looked back at the shore, and all my family was just sitting there in their lawn chairs just watching..  and then I just kind of stopped worrying because none of it mattered to me. I held my breath and then...I woke up!!!

So he told her: "Here's to spending the rest of me life sitting in church beside me wife."       "Oh," she said, "that is very nice, dear."       The next day, Mary ran into one of Paddy's drinking partners in the street.

Till now, he's only been down there twice. Once he fell asleep, and the other time I had to pull him by the ears to make him come".         ANY GOOD JOKES DO TELL :0)

Mrs. Miller is 60 years old, has six grown children and nine grandchildren, and you told her she was pregnant?”       The young physician continued to write his notes and without looking up at his superior, asked, “Does she still have the hiccups?”

20090307071717AAo0CsZ	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	X~X~X~X~X~X~Riddle~X~X~X~X~X~X…	Riddle~   You are driving in your car on the way to a hotel you will stay in.   You go in, and walk to the front desk where a manager is standing.   You ask him for the room key and he says while handing it over~ “Your room number is 503, go up to the third level and go to the door on the right.” Right after he says this the power goes out.    “Excuse me? What room am I in again?” You ask him. He replies “I’m sorry; we aren’t allowed to help when something happens to this hotel.”   So you decide to find it yourself, and you come to a white door, black door, and a blue door. Which do you go in?    You choose the white door. Well, you go up some stairs, and you find a tan door, brown door, and a silver door. Which do you go in?   You choose the silver door and go up some more stairs, when you get to the top of the stairs, you find one door. It is gold. You go in and find four people.    One steps forward and says-“You will die here, but, we will give you the choice of how to die…Death by rope? Death by heart attack? Death by electric chair? Or death by knife?”   Which do you choose? The walls are all steel the windows are steel the door is steel. You can’t run from them being locked.

20090307064740AAzuP60	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Girls, would you still like your crush if he looked ugly on the first date? (college people) - HELP!!?	We're in college. Alright, so this girl has a huge crush on me. I decided to ask her out. It wasn't a formal "date". We were just hanging out for the first time. Of course, normally I look really good (Which was why she crushed on me in the first place)....but last night I didn't sleep for 2 days and literally my face was swollen to the point where my own friends didn't even recognize me!      She still made tons and tons of eye contact and we walked together for 2 hours, roaming NYC at night. The whole time we were flirting with each other like crazy. It was obvious she liked me a lot. But at the end of the night I was really out of it...I was almost dying and I couldn't keep up anymore...I stopped asking her questions and I think she might have been a bit disappointed. She told me to "get some sleeeeep!" and then she said she is going to go home. And that was that. We did get along really well before that though. We basically acted like we were boyfriend/girlfriend already - we were really comfortable with each other. But she knows I haven't slept in 2 days and earlier she even offered me painkillers for my headache.      Girls, do you think she'll still like me and overlook the fact that I looked like total crap and didn't sleep?

A job should be something one should be able to have pride in, serving a real and useful purpose. Me, right now I make coffee and toast for bus drivers and get up exceedingly early to do so - but the bus drivers respect me for doing them a service which means a lot to them, even if it may not signify a lot to anyone else. These mailing schemes must lower the morale of all that are involved, because they do nothing for anyone besides luring folk into deceiving other folk that there might be some real, useful work for them to do at a time when many people are finding themselves out of work. Do you find this equally disgusting as I do?

20090307064610AA7WI0O	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What do you think about the movie "An American Haunting"?	I've watched this movie when it was first released in 2006 with Donald and Sissy. I simply didn't understand this movie. Then it came on cable the other night and I watched it again. I've gotten wiser since then so I figured that my mind might be a little more capable of understanding the plot, but unfortunately... I sorted out the details and came up with nothing once again. The only thing I get from this movie is that the father John Bell molested his daughter and the mother caught him. Honestly where does the ghost come in at? If the daughter is alive and clearly being held in the air and drug up the stairs, why is the ghost mistreating her? I can understand why it would do harm to the father. Then, why did the father see the daughters ghostly image in the mirror and then it all of the sudden becomes the mom? Why would he be seeing her ghost if she is alive? Then her ghost appears again at the end of the movie. So if she is the ghost, then it would seem that she is torturing herself. In any case I need someone to please explain this movie to me...

Last time when I asked about Slipknot,I mentioned that there was no number 9 in the band. Now I would like to know what is the description of #1 Joey Jordison's mask. #0 Sid's original mask is a respirator,#2 Paul's mask is a pig. #3 Chris' mask is a Tengu. #4 James' mask is a jester. #5 Craig's original mask is pantyhose,#6 Shawn's mask is a clown,#7 Mick's mask ia an ice hockey goalie mask,and #8 Corey wore facepaint first. Wikipedia.org could not give me any information on Joey's mask,so I'm assuming that it's either Charlie Manson or the Crow. But then again,I could be wrong.

She showed very caring attitude towards us students in schools, she is like our mother who raise us up! That is why my Whole Class decided to sing to her somthing special together before she leaves as there will be a program in our school! But we cant find the song that is suitable for the above situation! So Can anyone give me song name that is sad or maybe happy song, and it can be old(not before 90s songs) or new one(i prefer new one), NO Rock or Hip Hop, can be male, but female would be better for her I think. Thanks a lot if you have helped! And the lyric must have clear, sweet and nice meaning:) Thanks if you hv helped!

The group of scientists were able to stop time, change people memories, and would switch people around physically. I also partially remember the man going out to see a lighthouse, a main part of his original memories if I recall correctly. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

20090307085224AAEvqHk	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Trying to figure out what movie this is...?	I saw it late last year with my mom - the movie is about this guy who stands up to some punk girl, with issues. She tries to beat the crap outta him at school...lala, guy gets framed for turning her in, and when hes walking home from a party the girl are her guy friends jump him and accidentally kill him. They hide the body in the woods in a sewer. But he's still alive, and his other body follows her around saying 'go back to me. I'm alive.' He sees how her life is, and takes pity on her. Eventually, she takes a bullet for the cause of trying to save him, and in the end, as soon as he wakes up in the hospital, she says "I wanted to do the right thing." and then dies.       Good movie.

20090307085455AAvAlHw	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Anyone remember this 1970s commercial?	My mom tells me when I was little, probably around 1970, that I was terrified of "Dirt Man", a character in a Scope commercial. I don't remember it at all. The other day I saw an episode of MASH where they have to milk a drunk guy for his blood - he says, "Needles make me feel...oogy" and passes out. Something about that actor made me think of Dirt Man. Mom might be wrong about the product, but she's sure it was mouthwash. Thoughts?

Excellent body, nice interior, very nice chrome runs very good. There is a dent in the front right fender and the hood is bent at the hinges. Definetly worth putting some effort in as it is a straight solid car from Tennesse with a nice interior, nice chrome and a strong runner.      do you think this big ole lincoln is a steal for $2500?      the owner says hes not firm on the price and is motivated to sell. whats the lowest you think i can offer that he'll still accept?      i called him, he said it just went over 100,000 miles not much more. the paint is original, not bad but should get new paint. the hinges are bent in the hood and there is a dent on the right fender. there are no major rust spots and the underneath of the car is solid. the interior is nice and still original. i can drive it home, but it will need exhaust work done.

20090307095542AAgiL6j	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	You know you're a singer when...?	random question yeah...   but i was wondering if anyone had any thing like this...      You might be a swimmer if...   whenever you hear an electronic beep, you instinctively jump.   waking up before dawn to exercise seems normal(you might also be crazy).    bugs die of chlorine poisoning when they land on your skin.    the phrase "This set with fins" is better than hearing "You just won $1000."    you answer, "I don't need to" when someone asks when you showered last.    you learn how to squirt water 15 different ways.   your long term goal is to slap your bicep on your lat.   a friend asks how a certain guy dresses and you reply, "I only see him without his clothes off".   your friends have stopped asking you about your plans for the evenings.   you go from store to store desperately trying to find your favorite sports drink.   the first place you go when you're stressed out is a swimming pool.    your heroes are Janet, Jenny, or Amanda.    the phrase, "50 double armed backstroke with a breast stroke kick makes you happier than anything.   being fish-like is a compliment.   your friends don't even call you anymore because they know that you have no time to do anything.   your nightmares consist of a series of numbers ending in 0 or 5.    you sweat chlorine even after showering.   you just don't understand the charm of the swim suit edition.   getting smacked on the butt doesn't bother you at all.   your screenname has something to do with water or the pool.    your hair has a greenish tint and looks like straw.   somewhere on your body there is a small tattoo of a fish or a grouping of rings.   you look forward to holidays because you have a chance to double or triple practice.    hen you talk about "cuts" you don't mean injuries.    all of your friends are swimmers!       ...for a singer? i need one for my friend.   if anyone has anything like it that would be apprieciated.   thanks god bless X

I mean the Madea story and the Candy story linked at the end, but the whole rest of the movie switched stories throughtout the whole movie. It's kind of weird cuz you'll be watchin this poor little ghetto chick being raped and you are abou to, like, cry and then they go to Madea and you start to lyao.

20090307094046AAPsdYE	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Am i suffering from Bipolar Disorder or depression?	Am i suffering from Bipolar Disorder?   Hi guys. I am 21 years old and i recently spent time in a psychiatric hospital where i was diagnosed as having a depressive illness. Upon my discharge i now see a doctor from the hospital who put me on a 2 year course of fluoxetine for the low mood which i have been taking for about a month now. However i really think that i may be suffering from Bipolar Disorder.As well as the depressed periods, there are times when i feel fine and bright. It changes from day to day, one day i can be okay and then the next feel very depressed and have thoughts of harming myself. I have lost quite a bit of weight and my sleep is affected too but my doctor says i just have to wait until the prozac works. Do you think i may be suffering from Bipolar or am i suffering from depression. Thanks

20090307090909AAGK3iP	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	COMICS: Angel: After The Fall #17 and Angel #18?	So today i went to pick up my comics, and i had about 4 months worth waiting at my comic store...       I examined what lay in my bag more carefully when i got home.      Now i thought that AFTER THE FALL ended at issue 17, and i think I'm right, since Angel #18 is not labeled with "AFTER THE FALL"...      So I was curious, because i really DON'T understand this...      Is Angel #18 the next issue CONTINUED from After the Fall, OR is there a whole 'nother Angel comic line and there are 17 issues prior to this one?

20090307090932AAmGcrX	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Can you tell me what song this is?	I understand this will be difficult unless you know right off the bat what song I'm talking about.   The only lyrics I know are:   too ra loo ra loo ra loo ra lay      This just comes up with a bunch of irish folk songs if you search for it on google.   The song I'm talking about sings this particular line (I think it's the chorus) on a ascending scale with that last note going down to the sixth note of the scale.   It's a modern song, probably in the alternative genre.  It's upbeat (I heard a tap dance class dancing to it once-which is why I couldn't hear any of the other lyrics).   If you know this song and could tell me I would really appreciate it!  I'll definitely choose a best answer if I can find out what this song is!
