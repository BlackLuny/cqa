20090219165218AATCpIy	News & Events;Current Events	Did you read the article: "Economic Recession Means Fewer Shark Attacks?"?	Economic Recession Means Fewer Shark Attacks The total number of shark attacks declined from 71 in 2007 to 59 in 2008, the fewest since 2003, when there were 57, said Burgess, who works at the museum.       Is this as crazy as I think it is?  It's seem to be insane to extrapolate that a 19% drop is because of the recession.  In fact, my supposition is that, though they seem correlated...and I suppose on a graph it would be say so..it would be upward slopped.  But, isn't such extrapolation really poor science.  This was an quote from a scientist.

20090219203006AAZnF9q	News & Events;Current Events	Aren’t pork bellies the real sacred cow?	Isn’t this bill one of the most short-sighted proposals drafted as of late? Prof. Peiris can easily explain to you that these types of “blanket protections” especially as they relate to food commodities are not productive but destructive. I coined a phrase for it when I was at Berkeley, and doing my year in Oakland- I called it “ghetto-side economics”    R.M.C.B. Ratnayake’s views and proposals on several other agricultural/staple commodities have had the proven ill effect of driving up prices by reducing availability. Limiting supply and destroying demand by pricing the consumer out of the market. There are many better ways to ensure the increase of milk production and $13M is a negligible amount in comparison to the impending price spike of not only of beef but every other segment from eggs to poultry, from fish to muttons. I will venture to say that it also includes soap and fishnets and tourism. That is in the BILLIONS. If this is about slaughtering animals for food-I would remind you that is better than slaughtering them for naught, for that also occurs. Is killing any cow prohibited or a certain group or designation of cows? Is slaughtering of other animals prohibited such as chickens, goats, lambs, boar etc? Are you going to replace the class of cows that cannot be killed with a class that can produce beef for the domestic market? What is the plan in you suddenly have a spike in the herds or have herds that cannot be tended or managed? Why would you choose to give these protections to a cow of which there are many instead of to the leopard which truly needs a protection or set limits on wild boar whose stocks need to be monitored and at times protected and at times culled?    I am sure that Chandrika and co. or Ranil and friends are in India talking about how they saved the Brahmin cow. I already heard about it at the UN event on 8/27 but was surprised to hear that this proposal was floated through the JVP for from what MIA said it was a religious promotion of the Hindu. I have also heard that it was a promotion of Buddhists. In the Caribbean 2 years ago I heard that “they” were making the country vegan. What I would like to know is who the heck are “they”? Because “they” are wrecking the equilibrium of OUR country. I understand how the cow is valuable, as it is smarter than the drafter of this proposal. Why don’t we make a seat for the garlanded cow at Parliament. We can also invite the she-dog with the silver earrings that was married off to the 3 year old boy.     Mr. Ratnayake has a history of dallying into supply side economics and creating a non-feasible pricing segment by limiting availability thus extending inflation. This quite reminds me of a conversation that I had with his relative Avantha when I was about 10 years old-Avantha had just landed in the States and was in sticker shock over pricing of all goods as his thought process was based solely on currency conversion and not on supply and demand or per capita economic values. When he was expounding on the “outrageous” price of milk (the conversion rate was about 25/1 and milk was 1.25/g) I had to remind him that it was a gallon and not a liter, that with an average minimum income of $4.25/hr the real milk sold in the US was cheaper than the powder sold in Sri Lanka. When he came back to me gloating about 9 months later at the price spike of US milk and the relative decrease in price of powdered milk in Sri Lanka-I told him about the pork bellies. Later that year I met President Reagan-I believe that was when I met Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time also-We spoke about terrorism and pork bellies. If for whatever reason you want to save Brahmin cows make a bill specific to that but keep in mind that the separation of church and state can limit the areas of enforceability, if you are trying to protect the stock of dairy animals create a bill that is specific to that, if you are trying to give away a glass of milk each day to our school children, you must first make sure that it is not costing the government and society at large an equivalence greater than 15rs a glass. Saving all cows isn’t going to increase your milk production because all cows do not produce milk. It may create road congestion, unsanitary conditions and spread of disease but it will not produce more milk. Considering that the ghetto side economics of egg/poultry production has already been thoroughly explored –I do not understand why we would create a society where children have to depend on the government for a glass of real milk. We need to provide milk at a price where mom and dad can afford to serve it to the kids-for growing bodies need more than 1 glass a day. There is no issue about the goodness of government providing a glass for each child but what is wrong with this bill is that it is a religious edict encased in a social policy that has serious economic repercussions across the strata of the food cycle. I remember reading excerpts of a book called The Wheel of

Before you call for my head...this is a hypothetical question:      For those who are on death row, what would you think of offering a sort of option for life (so to speak). Give the option of going through with the sentence...or, being exposed to AIDS or "given" cancer, and using them to test for cures or treatments. If after being cured, they will be set free, or have their sentence commuted to life.      Note: I am not suggesting forcing anyone into this, but giving them this option. Do you believe it to be unethical either way, or could they provide valuable medical advancements for the rest of the world?

It seems to me that Israel (for some reason, can't fathom what it is) has been getting its own way all the time over there. After all, there have been enough ignored resolutions for us to get the idea that Israel is beyond the Law. There's no guessing how far they will go. There is, in theory, nothing whatsoever stopping them launching a nuclear attack on one or all of their neighbours--and getting away with it, if they duly trot out the ubiquitous "Israel has the right to defend itself" afterwards.      What about Adolf, as the UN's Envoy? Does he have the experience necessary to deal with it? Could he sort the situation out, to everyone's satisfaction? What do you think?
