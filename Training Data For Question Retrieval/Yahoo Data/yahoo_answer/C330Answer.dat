Most of his songs are just stolen from other artists, and he wants to be rock and roll, yet he throws rap/hip hop in his songs.  He is a disgrace to real musicians everywhere.|`|WENGBNXhaa	it's their choice if they want to like them or not. everyone is diferent. i like Poison but Kid Rock reminds me alot of Limp Bizkit....i don't listen to both of those that often and they get sort of annoying at times|`|yLz5eA7Daa	If you like them, who care what others think.

ETFaQiTzaa	There is no way that everyone will agree on a single best guitar player, and I understand what you are saying.<br>  <br>  However, I would say that the decision is easy for me, at least.  To Me Jimmy Page is the greatest guitarist, simply because Led Zeppelin's music appeals to me more, and his solos...are amazing.<br>  <br>  But I love Slash, too--and a lot of people say he's way overrated, which leads me to believe he's actually underrated, because his solo in Sweet Child O'Mine is absolutely incredible.<br>  <br>  I also think my taste in guitarist is affected by whether or not I like their music.  For example, if the band has an -amazing- guitarist, yet makes bad music, I'll likely not give him the credit he deserves.<br>  <br>  I find it easier to compare guitarist to each other than vocals (Freddie Mercury and Roger Daltery have nothing in common).  No, what I -really- don't get is comparing musicians of one instrument to musicians of another.  The other day my brother told me that Flea was a better bassist than John Frusciante was a guitarist.  ...I mean, how can you -convert- that?  It makes no sense to me.<br>  <br>  MA: (in no real order)<br>  1)  Jimmy Page<br>  2)  Pete Townsend<br>  3)  George Harrison<br>  4)  John Frusciante<br>  5)  David Gilmour|`|LkN5nr6faa	no, definitely not.<br>  <br>  MA: Vai is my guitar hero<br>  <br>  BA: EVH, Vai, Malmsteen, Gilmour, Satch (i think, it seems to change like the weather) but Vai, Malmsteen, and EVH are always in the top 5|`|sz1YqwUEaa	1.

These processes often end up being little more than popularity contests.  For all we know, the greatest guitarist of all time is probably much more interested in music than being known for greatness, and therefore may not care for fame and recognition, nor for commercial success.  The greatest guitarist of all time, is possibly a person with whom the world has little or no familiarity.|`|KERl45Oyaa	well it's hard to say on toptenz.net they have a top ten list<br>  10.

04b9292c00d775d3c8b879f786d89e14aa	I always respected Slash and after reading his autobiography I respect him even more. It sounded like success went to Axl's head. I read numerous interviews from band that opened for GNR and they all told the same tale about Axl being a a**hole. When the lead singer asks for his own dressing room, the camaraderie of the band doesn't exist anymore. Part of being a band is like being in a gang, sort of, you share all of the experiences of being on the road as a group together. When one of the members doesn't associate with the others, you kind of hate that guy. It's very unfortunate that this group broke up, because I think they would have been a super group still to this day. They would sell millions of records just on there name, like the Stones do, or Aerosmith. I also am a huge Slash fan. So, my answer is....Slash was right for leaving. I would have done the same thing.|`|gHQMj0ODaa	You know, to be honest, I don't think it comes down to being EITHER axl or slash being GnR. (comments above ^^^ ) <br>  Each member was absolutely crucial in the success, as well as each of the five having their own part in the demise of the band. Guns is my Absolute favorite band of all time, and although people DO focus on axl being an asshole most of the time, and criticize him for not showing up to rehearsals, etc, people forget that Slash too had his part. He was such a junkie that he wouldn't even show up for recording Appetite, but then he complained about Axl not showing up for recording sessions in Chicago for UYI? Axl would show up hours upon hours late and have the worst mood swings (you know that though,i'm sure.) Slash is my absolute favorite musician of all time (not to mention that he used to be really hot..they just dont make em like that anymore haha), but like I said, both of them had their own issues. Slash always had the right to leave, just as much as Izzy and Duff had their own rights to leave. After reading his biography and every other GnR book, I'm gonna have to go with Slash on this one.|`|sZwGlfsbaa	I think they were a great musical pairing. Axl had what Slash needed ( at the time, anyway ) and Slash had what Axl needed ( and still needs IMO) . I am going to go out on a limb and say Slash. <br>  <br>  Slash had every right to leave. Axl has this insufferable God complex that would chase anyone away. And this is coming from an fan!|`|UntkEecaaa	I like Slash better. He actually has talent unlike Axl who's a crazy, egotistical psycho. (and I mean that in a good way.) Yeah, Slash had every right to leave and get away form that weirdo.|`|EFaqj3GEaa	Slash even though the boy is overrated to heck. I'd like to shlappa jappa that Axl Rose, the boy has problems. He's flatsom and jetsam|`|oonb6rXYaa	Slash is a lot better than Axl. How do you not release an album for over a decade?|`|BnKpSZaUaa	OH MY GOD SLASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bWeNyjIVaa	Easy!--Slash. For good reason, for one Slash is a better musician than Axl was a singer, in fact when it comes to Metal, I prefer a singer to have a Rock-n-Roll voice like Dave Mustaine, Tom Araya, James Hetfield, Max Cavalera, etc; people who know Metal know who I'm talking about. Besides I thought Guns & Roses sounded Rock-n-Roll when they put out the "Spaghetti Incident". Which reminds me though, my favorite band member of Guns & Roses is their bassist Duff Mckagan which by the way is also in Velvet Revolver too & Neurotic Outsiders plus Seattle punk bands before Guns & Roses like the Fartz & Fastbacks, plus working with GnR's Izzy Stradlin & his Juju Hounds & lots of other bands & he worked with Iggy Pop too. I think if anything with Duff probably because he plays bass he's been underrated terribly bad, but I admire him with what he's done & tell you truth I've been a bit jealous of all the people he's gotten to work with from bands he's been in & working with Iggy Pop, although I've gotten to talk with Iggy, but Duff's gotten to work with Steve Jones of Sex Pistols, Professionals, solo stuff & the band he's been with Duff in--Neurotic Outsiders which he also was with Billy Idol & Steve Stevens as well in Neurotic Outsiders, plus Duff has worked with 3 members of the Cult including Ian Astbury as well. Interesting question but Duff never gets the recognition too. Here's Neurotic Outsiders--<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQoyXlxXq2E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQoyXlxXq...</a><br>  Ironically enough, they also had John Taylor of Duran Duran in Neurotic Outsiders too, which John Taylor has also played with Iggy Pop as well. |`|uU2MODv6aa	Dude, I am a HUGE GNR fan!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love slash and axl, they are awesome!!!!<br>  Its really hard for me to choose but if I had to........gosh.....um........I guess it would have to be slash. <br>  no disrespect to axl cause he rox! |`|Lc43axvlaa	guitar players are a dime a dozen.

And In my opioion Slash did the right thing too cause Axl was holding Slash back from what he really loved to do! I clap my hands for Slash for being like  I don't need Axl and I'm sick and tired of Axl thinking I won't be nothing without him!  I love Slash he inspired me with picking up the guitar!!!!!! I've loved both of them for the last 22 yrs!|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Slash<br>  <br>  because Guns n Roses is not that good now (you can find some songs off chinese Democracy)<br>  Slash's Snakepit was good <br>  Old GnR was good<br>  Velvet Revolver is Good<br>  <br>  theirfore i say Slash because he has on;y been in good bands|`|C7YbYUYPaa	This can't be serious.  I mean I love G n R, but Axl Rose is an egotistic, arrogant, selfish person, and although unique, has a horrible singing voice.<br>  <br>  Slash is widely considered one of the greatest of all time, (as I'm sure you know).  Slash was smart to get out when he did, and even though Velvet Revolver hasn't been a huge success, they are still good and popular.<br>  <br>  Slash over Axl every day.|`|xsn0Gu2Raa	i luv gnr but slash was in the right<br>  axl is a crazy psycho (but hes kinda cool)<br>  i like slash btr anyway<br>  i really want his top hat (so freaking cool)|`|AA10795350	GnR are overrated in general.<br>  <br>  But I have more respect for Slash.

Although he was gay,(which makes me love him more as I love gay men).  The essence of spirit of the word queen as a name and meaning apply to him. He was the greatest legend ever, past or present.

If you like the color of your guitar it will help you play better.  Why?  Because you will be comfortable with it and bond with it easier.  I have 3 guitars..2 white and one black.  That's just me.  I used to have a hot pink one in the 80's.  If you like it that is all that matters.|`|UFE7BJHBaa	If You are a lass, Fiesta red will be great.

wlGIig3Maa	I learned on acoustic then got an electric later.  I think that works best.  Although, if you don't even like acoustic music, just go with electric.  Play what you like so you'll be sure to stick with it.  That's the important thing really.  It doesn't do you any good to buy an acoustic and then quit in 2 months because you aren't enjoying it.|`|TuVtWVFxaa	Yes you can.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes. All you have to do if you want to stick with the acoustic teachers is bring your electric. They will play their acoustic and you will play your electric while you learn. If someone has a problem with that find another teacher.|`|b4ry9jPXaa	Okay look.<br>  Back in the sixties, there was this big boom of guitar players. They all wanted to be like the beatles. My gram said the ones who learned from the acoustic stuck with it, and eventually went on to kick *** with electric. The ones who started with electric, crashed and burned usually. <br>  Also, i started with acoustic, now i'm on electric, and I play punk type stuff. my two other friedns started with electric and haven't picked up a guitar for two years.<br>  Start with acoustic, play it for a few months, then get electric. It'll be better.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I started on the electric and I'm doing OK.  The only reason people go acoustic first is because you learn all the chords and strumming first and it is a little easier to learn.<br>  <br>  Acoustic guitar requires a little more tension on the frets so that helps you when you get to electric too.  They require different skills, but if you want to skip acoustic, go for it.|`|oweQc1OBaa	yes, yes you can. my cousin's guitar teacher said that it is a bit easier to start with electric. i am playing the acoustic right now, but my teacher uses an electric to teach me. hope this helps and goodluck |`|T0ed2lhJaa	hi tes but you need an amp. good luck.|`|arC8sQMVaa	Yeah you can start with what ever you want - no harm done.  I started off with electric and everynow and then i play a bit of acoustic.  A lot of the time you'll find that electic guitars have thinner necks than acoustic guitars, a thinner neck is easier to play for begginers.  <br>  <br>  A good idea some people try is to start off by perchasing a relatively cheep accoustic guitar to practise with and get the feel of the guitar, and ultimatly decide if the guitar is right for you.  Then, if you decide it is, you can move on to elecectric.<br>  <br>  True the type of guitar you use should depend on the song your playing, but its not much of an issue when you first start - chances are your not planning on doing any gigs some time soon, so either guitar is fine for practising and just casual playing.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	Definitely. I started out on electric guitar, though I definitely prefer acoustic. Electric might even be easier, the strings have less tension and it's easier to sound good if you have a lot of distortion blasting through an amp :-P I'd highly recommend learning all of the basic chords at first. Good luck! |`|PJcIRTOAaa	The thing about an electric is being able to keep the strings your not using muted, so the ones you are using don't sound like crap, or feed back on you. I started on electric, and i think if that's what you want to play i'd start out on one. Then if you want to try acoustic it'll be a piece of cake.|`|y6isQwFtaa	Yes, you can.  I started on an electric.<br>  But starting on an acoustic will help build up more finger strength when you are beginning, because they use heavier strings.<br>  A good starter acoustic would probably be cheaper than a good starter electric guitar also.|`|l9fisZoOaa	yes. its basically the same thing except one is electric and one is acoustic.

To each his own, but I say he's brilliant. |`|kdVxvMXSaa	Well, mediocre is going a bit far, but yes he is overrated, probably as much as Steve Clark was underrated by many.|`|4Z0G5x52aa	Absolutely, but the way he makes such amazing music with that "not high quality" skill is truly unbelievable.|`|DphUE9tbaa	I've never heard anything interesting in Guns n Roses and that included the cliched guitar riffs.|`|IFpmyRezaa	I wouldn't call him mediocre, but he is definitely overrated.|`|AA11893861	he's not bad for his time .Jinny Hendrix in my opinion was and is still the greatest with Jimmy Page coming in a very close second|`|PSDAp5Wxaa	Honestly yes, I know a lot of people worship him and he's not bad, but when you break him down he's not that amazing.|`|4PqWY1PEaa	Garden Gnome.|`|saI8SCiGaa	No. A musician isn't judged on whether he's doing difficult solos/passages or not...what's more important is, he's making good music...<br>  <br>  The real mediocre yet overrated guitarists are those who play fast solos, but are simply repeating a handful of set patterns over and over again on different keys...and most of the time, their solos don't really make much sense, it's like they're doing them on the progressions just for the sake of having a guitar solo...|`|p2QWEsb9aa	i dont think that he is mediocre because he really can play....but i dont think that what he does is Truly amazing because its really not that difficult to play. but he is a good guitarist thats for sure.|`|kXxEUWzHaa	yeah!!

eFUprygXaa	The song you're looking for is "Helpless When She Smiles" by the Backstreet Boys.

Dunno, haven't heard the whole song.
C7YbYUYPaa	Liar.  God that glam phase they went through was marvelous wasn't it?<br>  They all look so young though, and Freddie does look in his prime.<br>  <br>  The reason I choose Liar is because it really shows off everyone's talents.  A great guitar riff by Brian, one of the few songs where Roger's drums really stand out, and of course Freddie shines with his vocals.  Kind of tough for any bass guitar to really stand out, but you can defenitly tell Deacon is playing there, and I think Queen is one of the few bands who actually tried to incorporate each instrument into the songs.|`|NwF33thlaa	I am going with Liar. I love both songs, but Liar is one of the first ones I heard. <br>  Yes, he does look great in that video.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	I really like how aggressive "Great King Rat" is (Died syphilis 44 on his birthday/Every second word he swore, yes he was the son of a whore), and the change in the middle section. <br>  <br>  I prefer "Liar" though, because of all the changes (ballady section after the intro, heavy chorus, call and response).

C7YbYUYPaa	Oh man, this is really hard....<br>  <br>  In terms of simply intros, I'll take Sweet Child O Mine.  It is actually really, really simple to play, but I think that is what makes it so great to me.  It is a basic riff, but the sound is just so smooth and it flows so well, I can't help by air guitar to it lol.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick a song, it would be Layla for sure.  Clapton is a better guitarist than Slash, and even though both are love songs, Layla is just a better overall song.  Too hard to choose.|`|Catsy82Caa	I love the intro to Layla, Sweet Child O'Mine is pretty good but a little too loud for me. |`|oUZLZusjaa	This is tough, but as I'm sure most people will, I'm going to have to go with Layla. Don't get me wrong, SCoM is one of the greatest intro riffs out there, but there's just something about the Layla riff that sends shivers down my spine to this very day, no matter how many thousands of times I've already heard the song.|`|8pHArOJdaa	I'll say GNR-Sweet Child O Mine.
C7YbYUYPaa	Hmmm, I'm not exactly sure.<br>  <br>  I had heard this too, and it sounds interesting.  From what I had heard, a lot of the movie would show actual clips from real Queen concerts caught on tape, as to ensure that no one would seem to copy Freddie.  I also heard rumors that Johnny Depp would probably play Freddie, and Depp is a fantastic actor, and one who I think could capture the Mercury persona.<br>  <br>  On the other side of the spectrum, I don't know if I could deal with that.  A lot is unknown about Freddie, considering he was very private, and I'm not sure some hollywood director could capture all that was Freddie Mercury.  I'm afraid that a lot of the bad publicity the media gave Freddie in those days would show up in a movie about him, and that would be a travesty to his legacy.<br>  <br>  As for people suddenly becoming fans, I see the good and the bad.  Like you, I don't want people to take an interest for the wrong reasons, which I think a movie would force.  BUT, if people learned about his story, listened to his songs, and in turn supported Freddie and what he believed in, then I find it O.K.<br>  <br>  The more people who fall in love with Queen's music and Freddie's voice, the longer Freddie Mercury will live on.  His life was music, and his spirit lives on in it.<br>  <br>  |`|DibFrwxlaa	No.  Madonna already made Truth Or Dare.<br>  <br>  It'll be alright.  Queen is more popular than you know, just not perhaps where you are.  And besides, if Queen does become a huge sensation as a result of this you get to be all smug and talk about how you liked them before the movie.|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Oh yes... they made a commercial that had a girl wearing a Nirvana shirt in it (That JcPenny's one that parodied the Breakfast Club) and now I have seen several girls wearing them since it came out.

I AGREE!! haha|`|gO2brrDbaa	Someone on here said they were making a movie about Keith Moon...<br>  <br>  But yeah I see where you're coming from.  It kind of loses its originality if everyone else likes your favorite band.  Then again, why not widen everyone's musical tastes?<br>  <br>  Although it is weird at my school--apparently the new cool music to listen to is Bob Marley, who I've liked for years.|`|frWIjqcQaa	i understand how you feel about this how you dont want everybody in there mother to all of a sudden start loving your favourite musician just because its the cool new thing on tv yeahh that can be annoyin because its like there almost "poser fans" but theres nothing you can really do i mean im sure within a month or so people willl go back to the way things were and you can continue to live your life lol|`|SztleLnUaa	Ok, I can see what you mean.<br>  But think that, that might be a chance for some people to get interested in Queen's music and Freddie.It might be a chance for some other people to discover and appreciate them!<br>  I hope too, that if they do it it would be worth while!<br>  <br>  I adore Freddie myself!|`|u4eN9gbAaa	Like Across the Universe?<br>  <br>  Or the songs from Gutiar Hero?<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeah it makes me mad....<br>  <br>  I'm happy because they like the music (even though those two examples are all cover songs they use....), but I'm not happy that they like it just because it's "in" right now...|`|AA10795350	Right, because NO ONE's heard of Freddie Mercury or Queen. lol This movie will change everything!|`|AA10527931	I would be mad! I had loved them first! I know how you feel. |`|dMLtCenLaa	I absolutely agree. I'm not that old, I'm only 22. But Queen and other classic rock is what I grew up listening to. So I'm very familiar with Freddy Mercury. And I'd hate to see these Miley Cyrus fans suddenly thinking they know everything about Queen.<br>  <br>  It's like that with lots of stuff. The Fray came and played to a small crowd at my college and they were amazing. But no one had heard of them. About 6 months later, "Over my head" hits the radio and everyone loves them. I liked it better when they were just mine. |`|yfxM0P8taa	I wouldn't have a problem if suddenly everybody started liking my favourite musician. It doesn't stop me liking him, it doesn't lessen his talent. <br>  I don't own him so why shouldn't other people enjoy him.<br>  Why shouldn't his talent be shared? That's what the artists would want isn't it? They don't perform in order to be ignored, or appreciated by a select few.<br>  I understand what you are saying about the movie; I hate to see a great artist's life story get twisted around to suit the script.<br>  Now relax and listen to Bohemian Rhapsody again.|`|K4Nt8kZPaa	I sorta can tell what you're saying...<br>  <br>  But imagine what an honor it would be for your favorite musician.<br>  <br>  I would love it if anyone made a movie about Syd Barrett. I would be ecstatic, and i would just ignore the posers =/|`|HJYDXXtBaa	Mad, i'd be glad.|`|Oj33fAbWaa	THERE'S A MOVIE?!<br>  <br>  Dear God, i hope it does him justice...<br>  <br>  These things are often wrongly portrayed. No, that won't happen with me. All my friends know about Queen, and Freddie, and they know how obsessed i am with him. They don't know ALL the songs, and stuff i know, but i'm sure even if they did he wouldn't be their favourite. They're all too much into modern music...<br>  <br>  I'll be able to drag them along to it, without them complaining, cos they know how much i love him. One day, i just went up to my friend Amy and said "Did you know that Freddie mercury weighed 6 pounds 12 when he was born?" Then walked off. They know he's mine.<br>  <br>  If they know you love Freddie, and Queen, then they should know that he was your 'thing' first. Perhaps sing a Queen song they've never heard, and when someone asks, say "oh it's Queen. My favourite band You probably wouldn't know that one, it wasn't released as a single". Or something along those lines, but not being rude.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you liked him anyway, then you are the only true fan. If they all like him because of a film, then it'll pass, and it's all feigned. Just continue to think that they don't know him like you do, and  they don't really care, Don't let them get to you. I always feel that frustration, and i'd feel exactly the same if i were you.<br>  <br>  Wait, are you American? I'm English, i hope it comes out in the UK.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the immense length of writing... =/<br>  <br>  =]|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	First, let me put your mind at ease:  the Disney Channel fans wouldn't go see a movie about Freddie Mercury unless Nick J*nas played him and Hanah Montana played Brian May.<br>  <br>  Having said that, the thing I would be concerned with would be presenting the total story.  I'd hate to see a movie about Freddie just focus on his sex life.  The thing that would bother me more than anything, however, would be ACCURACY.  I cannot stand Hollywood taking liberties with a person's life (they call it "dramatic license," I call it "lying").  Case in point:  in "Walk the Line" Johnny Cash's father was portrayed as a hard guy with a strained relationship with Johnny, while in Cash's autobiography Johnny said his father was a loving man who loved him to death and never had an unkind word for him.<br>  <br>  As for being a snob, I don't know.  I'm sure some of the people who bought "Bohemian Rhapsody" on 45 in 1975 may have had a snobbish attitude toward people who discovered the song because of "Wayne's World."  Others probably said, "Welcome aboard, what took you so long?"<br>  <br>  BTW, who are they looking at to play Freddie Mercury?|`|t7U9rliVaa	Only if they "like" that artist to fit in.  If they watch a movie about them, decide to check out their material, and become an actual fan then I'm fine with that.<br>  <br>  Once they start acting like they know every single thing (and of course, they don't) about them I get mad.

ZQslmW5xaa	I think most people have moments or even days like that.  I deal with it by connecting to my friends - especially my best friend - we tend to prop each other up during such times.  Deep breathing helps me too when all I see is doom and gloom.  <br>  <br>  I try to remind myself of things I've been successful at in the past.  Most of all I try to convince myself that the feeling - however miserable - will pass eventually - since it happens from time to time.<br>  <br>  Another thing that helps is changing my location and what I am doing - like maybe going swimming or taking a bike ride - this seems to help sometimes.<br>  <br>  Hope you're feeling better soon.  You're smart and you will succeed - I just know it.|`|UPcRUvHpaa	?i did, you need to learn to love yourself as you are, a unique human, embrace yourself with all your faults, you have a right to be here, there is a reason why you were born, then you need to make some goals, small ones to start with, each time you succeed you make a longer time duration between goals, i'm not saying that you will see results right away, yet you will.......i promise!<br>  if you need to talk, you can e-mail me, you can talk about anything, or ask me anything, i'll help you if i can!<br>  good luck!?|`|IR9chRTiaa	Yep.

Maybe deep inside i feel grateful for whatever reason that i dont understand sometimes :-)|`|zmNg5YNQaa	I do right now! <br>  <br>  New school, no friends, unpopular, hate my homelife, school is getting tougher, and not a single girl out of the 1000 that go to this bloody school like me!<br>  <br>  Oh and I liked this girl, and I found out she has HUGE issues, and then her friend told me to do nothing, and then she got asked out and said yes! I couldn't have done a thing! and now I like a girl with the same name, and all I can think of is how this is just another rejection waiting to happen, I can't get out of this depression...|`|vsKrGw2caa	yeah during school the other day the teacher asked everyone a different question and i was the only one who got it wrong...i felt soo stupid yeah and i dealt with it by saying that i wasn;t paying attention and that made me seem more stupid<br>  |`|db35fb694f31e55fc8e70ca5bcb5b351aa	Yes, i do sometimes. Mostly because of depression..<br>  I've found talking to a counselor helps, it may take a few people to find someone you click with though.|`|Xuu2AnqJaa	Yes. Sometimes, I get these absolutely horrible bouts of stammering and making absolutely no sense or being very redundant when talking... I'm an extremely shy person.|`|2439e77074611735132c27e74cf8f9a4aa	oh yeah! i just do something i know i will succeed on and feel good about my self and then i go back to what ever i was having problms with and try again  |`|a91f177ecc274eec702b308e6d31994eaa	I drink but you can do better.  Just go with the flow. You'll snap out of it eventually.  If not seek professional advice. |`|VxE46bSFaa	yeah, i do feel similar to that sometimes. I talk to people that love and care about me and then I feel better. |`|ZXGRJuI9aa	i think most people feel like that sometimes|`|tbQWWAxfaa	I feel that way after i ate to much |`|jjMY5EsWaa	im feeling that way right now, amd im not dealing with it well at all|`|9lEmTICwaa	i felt like this earlier today hmmph im still waiting i dont know what for|`|yUMH5u6daa	yep.. I continue my boring day |`|AA10471659	i felt like that many times but i sucked it up and got what ever help I needed and went on with my life|`|QK84psFLaa	yes.... I try to see that though things are bad now, I have a long life, and that the sadness is a reminder that I am alive|`|7Ra7p7xjaa	    Well your not alone and don't let the light dim in you no matter how bad things get around you. We need more lights in the world and you care about doing something and that is worth a lot even if big corporations don't see it, even if it seems like everything is an uphill battle. The only difference between  a successful person and one that thinks they are a complete failure is the successfull person learned from there mistakes and tried something else that did work for them. If you seem to loose one battle just change your battle plan. You are smart and you have the ability to dream and do anything if you are willing to take a chance on failing. But you have limitless choices just rekindle that light and do what you love to do first that gives you the most joy.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Yes.  I hear you.<br>  <br>  I've had days into weeks into months into *whole years* like this.  I've been fighting this all my life, gentle Asker.<br>  <br>  And the only (healthy) things I've found that work halfway reliably for me are:<br>  <br>  --Taking a short time out, to try to relax, and *breathe* deeply and fully.  I learned breathing exercises when I was very young, out of necessity, because of my asthma and allergies, and they've been a godsend since.<br>  <br>  --Taking a longer time out, to do something that *Immediately* gets me out of my own head: reading, volunteering, taking long walks, going out to dance (when I was younger), doing some yoga or weightlifting (ditto).<br>  <br>  Point is, when you can re-focus your mind, either on your own bodily efforts (with the exercise) or on the efforts of other people (by helping them out), this has the effect of firmly saying *NO* to your foul mood, and to the despair it brings.  When you feel unable to succeed, this is when you *have to* try something....absolutely, as hard and as un-intuitive as it sounds.<br>  <br>  --Taking the things you want and need to suceed at, and breaking them down into the tiniest pieces possible.  Breaking it down like: if you need to send someone a difficult letter, don't look at it as doing the whole thing at once.  Take *one hour* to find the materials (pencil, paper, envelope, stamp).  Then the next one, write the letter.  Then the next one, put the letter in the envelope.  Then the next, seal and address the envelope.  Then the next, put the stamp on it.  Then the next, *mail the thing*.<br>  <br>  Go slowly.  Decide to take all day if not all week.  Conscientiously set the pace yourself so that you *succeed one tiny wee piece at a time*.  Yes, it sounds more retarded in text than it is in practice.  The point of it is to break the task down such that you *know for a fact* you can and will succeed and get it done, one piece at a time, one foot in front of the other.<br>  <br>  --And....failing all that.  Affirm to yourself over and over again, "This too shall pass," put the blinders on, and just muddle through, doing the *thing right in front of you* and no more.<br>  <br>  Again, one piece at a time, one foot in front of the other.  Turn the cell phone off.  TV and internet too.  Just plod through.  Grind it out so you can say "I did the damned thing, all right??"  Then *Insist* you feel better for it until you *actually do*.  You did after all keep your word and *get it done*.  ^_^<br>  <br>  I know.  It sounds like a really sucky, mediocre way to live life and get stuff done.  Which is *Why* you need to remember:<br>  <br>  This too shall pass.  Because it will.  Life does get better.<br>  <br>  ^_^  I hope I was helpful.  Hang on and be strong.  Email me if you need to.  Please?|`|5jjLSrCZaa	Not really but if i feel sad I usually listen to music to cheer up.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	if i was a loser i might feel that way|`|9RABAkjOaa	Yeah I feel like that all the time. I feel like I'm unable to succeed at the simplest things, which makes me feel inferior to everyone else. <br>  I can't deal with it. There's not been one way I've found to feel better about it. I just hold everything in and be quiet, then without even realizing, I do the craziest things. People probably look at me like I'm a retard. Well I am. |`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	I have felt this way often for most of my life. Many people feel this way, although many deny it. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you are depressed. I know this may sound silly but it could be seasonal. Some people get depressed in the fall/winter because of the decreasing amount of sunlight. I know this affects me. <br>  <br>  You could see a psychiatrist for this, although in my opinion I dont think that always works. I used to see shrinks and counselors and take meds for this, and eventually I realized I thought most shrinks were crazier than me, and I hated taking my meds.<br>  <br>  A year ago someone shared a video with me called "the secret". It changed my life and the way I see things has not been the same since. It's difficult to describe. But basically it's about how to transform your thoughts to make anything you want come true. I've provided the link below if you're interested.<br>  <br>  Real power comes from INSIDE YOU. You just need to believe it.<br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  |`|atrdhRAlaa	well<br>  <br>  i think u should start looking optimistically, and not be so negative, when u think negatively ur body follows and things become negative but if u feel like things are going for u everything falls into place|`|fWclxi9Baa	i feel like that everyday maybe its because i dont like to have friends who needs them right |`|758ac53ab19478c168253f9f10a138b4aa	No.|`|m3pFnkb6aa	I find something humerous to make me laugh my *** of and then say **** it and move on|`|cC9gfSBHaa	I volunteer, it gets my mind off things, and makes me appreciate what I have a bit more|`|43U5vv7Faa	when im depressed..<br>  yes..<br>  but to suceed i try harder to qet there && than..<br>  i do :)

wDisAke1aa	Another one is Killer Crush by Millencolin. They write songs like that because after years and hundreds of hot babes it apparently gets old and uneventful, they lose feeling for girls like that and they seem to isolate themselves and fat chicks, usually being outcast can relate with them and won't leave them when they are broke or be disgusted when they smoke.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Those rocker guys must be really picky about their fat girls.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	LOL.

'What the Hell is this?' he said to himself as a little 'dust' cloud appeared when he shook them out. <br>  <br>  'April', he hollered into the bathroom, 'Why did you put Talcum Powder in my underwear?' <br>  <br>  She replied with a snicker. 'It's not talcum powder; it's 'Miracle Grow'!!!!!!|`|pLPKo6mBaa	Hahahahha!<br>  <br>  Uh, I have no idea. I know a lot of people at my school like "thick" chicks.

JYj9s5ABaa	J'ai vraiment adorée, ?a fait du bien de revoir nos petit interne (enfin résident maintenant) du Grace Hospital.<br>  Et puis il y a quand même eu quelque petit changement assez intéressant comme l'arrivée de Lexie Grey la soeur de Meredith ou le départ de Burke.<br>  Vivement les épisode de demain d'après les extrait il a l'air vraiment intéressant.|`|Owoi9b9uaa	J'ai vu les 3 premiers épisodes passés mercredi a la télé et j'ai vraiment beaucoup aimé, cette saison a l'air meilleure que la 3ème ! <br>  Ce que j'ai aimé ? C'est un tout en fait, l'histoire Izzie/Georges (quel rebondissement même si on s'y attendait), la fa?on dont ils traitent les nouveaux interne je trouve ?a marrant (surtout cristina !!!) et la demi-soeur de méredith qui fait surface. Ca met un peu de piment ! J'aime trop cette série, vivement mercredi !!!|`|fb3cd70ccc1f65bfb6e2b423e0a4f481aa	Alors la,il ne faut pas me lancer sur Grey's Anatomy ! xD<br>  <br>  En effet ,je les ai déja vu jusqu'au début de la saison 5 , mais je peux te dire quelques petites choses : première chose, Grey's anatomy , c'est du grand art !! =D<br>  <br>  jvais faire court : SAVOURE !!!!   ;-)|`|Ihf2ehsyaa	personnelement j'adore cette serie, j'ai adoré les 4 saisons et je vien de voir le premier episode de la 5eme saison, et c'est vraiment super.<br>  ne vous inkiété pas, pas de spoiliers, j vous laisse admirer le série ;)|`|ePTop5NKaa	Moi "grey's anatomy" j'adore donc c'est vrai que je n'est pas étais si dé?ut que ?a.<br>  Maintenant j'avoue que de les voir tous médecin maintenant ?a m'a fais bizarre mais bon il faut bien que la série et les personnages évolue c'est normal...<br>  Après pour répondre a tes question de savoir si j'ai aimé ou pas aimé??<br>  Je pense pouvoir t'en dire plus mercredi soir, une fois que l'on aura vu d'autres épisodes, car la ?a commencé.|`|u02Z2I3saa	Ils sont tous tjs aussi attachants.Addisson me manque quand même mais j'ai commencé à regarder private practice je ne me sens donc pas si orpheline que ?a.

VxE46bSFaa	Aww don't make 6th grade your last year of trick or treating! Be your favorite character from a movie or something. Last year my costume was pretty stupid when I was in 6th. This year I'm dressing up in school colors and dying my hair and stuff. Try being a little girl at a sleep over. Wear flannel pants and pigtails and carry around a teddy bear and pillow.|`|AXSFFE33aa	lol why are you going to stop trick or treating at 6th grade. I'm 14 and still trick or treat.<br>  <br>  But be a dead cheerleader or something<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aix4nCySslRW4YUXYjdgHIXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081004172826AAdoTv6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QNXvDJyVaa	I think your most pressing issue is your grammar. Are you seriously in 6th grade? What's happening to the American education system??<br>  <br>  And if you stop trick or treating in sixth grade, you're obviously really lame. I'm a freshman in high school and I'm still trick or treating this year.<br>  <br>  As for costume ideas, why are you worried about having an "imbarissing" costume? Halloween is about going all out, not about being self conscious.
PtWb8ux4aa	It is if your a FLY!|`|tdR7ZdiLaa	Definatly! If you have it in its worst form! You really don't want it. Well if you've got it obviously you know but really, it is a phobia. These are a few things it can cause if it is really bad:<br>  <br>  - Sitting crossed legged on a chair instead of properly!<br>  - Constantly looking around you!<br>  - Being completely naked!|`|KPIqG6Caaa	I have a phobia over snakes.<br>  It is so bad I can't even look at pictures of them.<br>  <br>  2 weeks ago we had some in school.<br>  I didn't even have a morning coffee break because to get to the staff room, I'd have had to pass the room where they were.|`|dz2YYh7Saa	Yes it is a real fear.  I have it.  I get physically sick at the very thought of spiders.  I've been this way for about seventeen years.|`|Oey2fUexaa	im afraid of the dark...death.........rapist/murders...pp... with guns...(not the police)  oh yeah and the kkk,racist ppl,gangs................big cocaroaches that live in the south like in texas and florida|`|AA11498376	Yes it is a real fear and I am most afraid of another Religious Right American President (I am European).|`|R4vZjkviaa	Absolutely, it's a real fear. And it's definitely one of mine. |`|tW3I9seAaa	im afraid of the apocalypse, nothing more. <br>  <br>  also im afraid of kids tv shows, cookies and male strip clubs|`|VxE46bSFaa	I think any fear is a real fear. I just have really random fears like of calling people on the phone/ dialing the wrong number.|`|P59iRsNBaa	yeah it's a real fear any word with phobia on the end is a fear of something. it means being really afraid of spiders. |`|Mq0F83Heaa	It is a common fear. I think just stomping a spider is good enough to get over it though.|`|vkdYlgWtaa	Arachnaphobia IS real. It means fear of spiders.|`|PivlQGsdaa	i just shivered at you saying arachnaphobia<br>  cryyyyy|`|lGZasy4Taa	No but anoraknaphobia is!|`|AA11278500	yes it is and its one of mine.that and the fear of dying|`|7hO3YnG7aa	My little sister hass Arachnaphobia, serious one too!<br>  <br>  |`|JLvc2RMraa	Yes it is a real fear.<br>  I am most scared of republicans and guns|`|AA10937948	of spiders<br>  getting bitten by dogs|`|6fVVSeHfaa	I think it's a real fear, considering I have it.|`|O9pLSGO0aa	Not afraid of spiders, that's for sure.<br>  My biggest fear is needles...

This is the way people have been told to think of spiders. But in some cultures, the spider is a delicacy. If you think about it a Spider is basically a crab but on land. And people enjoy eating crab, so why not?|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	I am afraid of being attacked by a very dangerous animal(wolf. bear, tiger, shark, etc.) or being stung or bitten by a poisonous insect or arachnid(spiders, scorpions, etc.).<br>  <br>  In short, I am afraid of dangerous creatures.|`|v77RN9Yhaa	Spiders definitely. I wouldn't be afraid if they weren't poisonous. I know not ALL of them are but I don't know which ones are and which ones aren't so I'm afraid of all of them.|`|6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	losing a loved one|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Yes it is real,my fear is something bad happening to my kids.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	arachnophobia is a real fear. <br>  and my fear is that someday, an evil pirate ghost will jump out at me through the computer screen while answering polls and survey question on Y!Answer. <br>  <br>  my, *ahem*, other phobia is looking other a staircase well, and sharp ledges. |`|cE20wh1laa	it is for me, believe me you wouldnt want to be around when i see them i get the shivers even thinking of them!! but im not just afraid of spiders....any kind of creepy crawly|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	I believe it is, <br>  mine is "Ranidaphobia" fear of frogs|`|HUDSwT3baa	Not really, its just a name given to melodramatic retards.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Heights are pretty scary. That and claustrophobia, being suffocated in a small place.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Yes...<br>  <br>  i'm afraid of cockroaches.|`|p5LH0oACaa	yes. a fear of spiders. my friend has it|`|YJPSKS0vaa	ARGH !!! HELLL YES !!! <br>  <br>  it is as I have it|`|80Igi3Mxaa	fear is just a word and its something we create ourselves in our minds.<br>  <br>  <br>  we fear what we dont understand, and we fear uncertainty. <br>  <br>  something about 8 legs and 4 eyes walking invertedly on a ceiling that doesn't quite agree with my DNA,  just find it 'odd' - thats why its a fear, but in essence its actualy really nothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am most afraid of dying prematurely or dying painfully.|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	Yes. I am terrrified of spiders. I can't even watch one on t.v without seriously having nightmare. You know that movie called Arachnaphobia with Jeff Daniels, well I watched it and I has nightmares for months. I would always be trapped in a small space and they would pour in all over me, I would wake up trying to brush them off because i could still feel them. Even thinking about them gives me the shivers! AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!|`|esRI2Dooaa	Yes some people really are terrified of spiders in a very real way. The fear is irrational, as very few spiders are dangerous, and most of those encountered by humans, especially here in Europe, are completely benign.|`|0tyZ7kxAaa	yeah it is.<br>  I'm afraid of people and myself throwing up.. I'm serious.|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	The chicken is affraid of somebody cooking it for dinner!|`|N7fNwIQSaa	yer i physically shudder whenever i notice a spider and start to move away very fast(i run), it often annoys my mum because she has to get rid of the spiders!|`|eox05Kghaa	Darkness<br>  <br>  Creepy crawlies|`|CsnRznSNaa	Spiders|`|2DNpd4BLaa	airplanes :T|`|it3ecbVEaa	SPIDERS..

And that song came out in the 90s.|`|komayN73aa	ahhhhhhhhhhhh<br>  idk the actual song but we play it at work<br>  it starts out like the interpol song "theres no i in threesome"  and each tiem i get excited cuz i think its interpol and i like them<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  then it turns into the other song :/
VxE46bSFaa	If I'm not in a good mood i get really sarcastic. But most of the time I still post have a nice day so it sounds dumb that i was being sarcastic and happy so i have to change my answer. It does sometimes affect my answers|`|080pnN8uaa	My answers are the ultimate indicator of my moods.|`|jDf4pcY6aa	I'm hangover so my answers are pretty lame right now.

yjSGVfdiaa	Holy cr*p!.... I just got one too.  What the eff?!<br>  <br>  MA:   I can't be mad at Perry Farrell - one of my high school friends is his new guitarist.  But... yeah.... the solo stuff kinda sucks.<br>  <br>  Your answer gave me an idea though.  I'd like to slap the egotistical members of some of my favorite bands for breaking them up and not being able to work together anymore.<br>  <br>  I miss the original bass player from QOTSA - I can't think of his name.<br>  The Pixies - they tour - but no new albums? <br>  The Unicorns - the Islands are not even close<br>  Death From Above 1979 - not one of my favorite bands, but I would really have liked to see them put together another album - it would've been cool to see where they would go<br>  Smashing Pumpkins - stop using the name Billy - the music now is a poor excuse at mimicry.<br>  <br>  I could list more, but I'm good for now.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I'm a huge Pixies fan too, saw them in their reunion tour last year.   Frank was willing to go back into the studio (and had started writing new material, which, allegedly, can be found on his last album "Sevn Fingers"), but Kim Deal shot that down.  Instead she came out with a new Breeders album saying that she hates when her favorite bands get back together - release something new - and it pales in comparison to the old stuff.  We'll probably never see any new stuff from the Pixies sadly, other than "Bam Thwok" and the cover of "Ain't That Pretty at All."  Based on "Bam Thwok" - Kim Deal may have been right, although the cover of 'Ain't That Pretty at All" is awesome.<br>  <br>  I really recommend seeing them live though, if you haven't yet.  Great show.|`|8Etio7HSaa	WOW Congrats!!<br>  I had a hard time figuring out who you are because you're my contact, you are "Bag of Tricks" right?!<br>  <br>  MA: I'd like to slap all of System of a down members, for breaking up!!<br>  Also, Korn for annoying me, lol, I mean they used a beautiful vegetable as their name!! They could have named themselves " brussel" or sth XD<br>  Who else, Maybe also SlipKnot, I mean, Honestly, i liked their old stuff till "All Hope is gone" came out, they deserve it!!<br>  Axl Rose ofcourse!!<br>  I'd like to slap Michael Jackson actually, i want to sucker punch him in his mutilated nose, for what he did to the kids, and to himself, damn some people can be really stupid!!|`|9ryByj4faa	I would slap Miley Cyrus and tell her "***** you can't sing! your only famous of your dad!!!"|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Oh man I would slap Sammy Hagar so hard his momma would feel it.

12QJ9QMRaa	When I was really young..like pre 5th grade..I loved me some COuntry music. (its waht my Dad listened to)<br>  <br>  Well..growing up in Gangsta Rap land...that got ridiculed outta me before Middle School.<br>  <br>  I started listening to lots of Rap in the mid to late 80s.... but it just didnt really work for me... I felt liek a Poser (which is hwat most white kids that try to act Gangsta actually are)<br>  <br>  Well..I had also heard Iron Maiden and Metallica by this point in time..but kept it in the closet for fear of ridicule..til I met a bunch of Metalheads in 8th grade.<br>  <br>  After that I jumped into the total Metal Stereotype with both feet.<br>  <br>  Moved again in my Sr Year... to HillBilly Hell in California (near Sacramento..yet everyone had a Texas accent..the horrors)... and actually rediscovered that there WAS good country.<br>  <br>  By the time I was twenty, I had also re-added Classical (my Moms influenc) Rock and Roll, and had discoverd Blues and Jazz for myself.<br>  <br>  Also around this time..I started listening to Celtic and other Folk musics....<br>  <br>  So..basically since my early 20s (I am 33 now) I have been in this same Open to dang near anything phase.<br>  <br>  Really the only exception would be Pop/Top 40...which I still finds to sound like Nails on a Chalkboard for the most part.  But even then..I like some bands like Evanescence.<br>  <br>  And..I spent the last decade largely despairing the state of Metal..until Roxel and company got me listening to Non US based Metal..... and now its like a Musical Rennassaince.... (not just for Metal..but all kinds of World Music)|`|U8aXa8xEaa	Maybe it's because I'm older now, but I don't really go through phases anymore.  I just have different musical moods from one day to the next.  Today, I am listening to music that is mellow but has a positive message.  No sad stuff.  I just want to relax and feel good today.  But yesterday I was listening to upbeat music.  Energizing.  I listen to mostly classic rock (Beatles, Aerosmith, Boston, Eagles, etc.), but I have some stuff that is current too.|`|87CAVhs2aa	When i was young, elementary school, my favorites were The Monkess and Melissa Etheridge (thanks to my mom).<br>  Then i liked Hilary Duff and Disney in 4th-6th grades (forgive me)<br>  Then in 7th i got into The Beatles (along with Harry Potter) and now i love the classics.<br>  My iTunes is pretty diverse:<br>  Aerosmith<br>  R.E.M.<br>  Melissa Etheridge<br>  The Ramones<br>  The Kinks<br>  The Monkees<br>  John Lennon<br>  Paul McCartney and the Wings<br>  The B-52s<br>  The Rolling Stones<br>  And, of course, half of my music being The Beatles.|`|pVTevFJgaa	I had a Mainstream radio-Rap-hiphop-rnb phase.

I Played them forever.<br>  <br>  I found a local classic rock station that if it was in human form would basically be the love of my life.<br>  <br>  Now I'm  litterally addicted to classic rock and i love it some may say I need help...also every little sub-genre of rock n roll, metal, glam, gosh everything having to do with it...<br>  <br>  Queen all the way|`|PsFGx8Bxaa	when i was in kindergarten i love Nsync (ya that was a dark time ion my life;]) and around 1-5 grade i liked glam bands like Bon Jovi then 5-8th (current) i like Guns N Roses and i don't think this one is a phase cause i pretty much memorized everything about the band|`|iGCrZXTWaa	one and a half year ago, it was my Beatles phase. this past half year is my Rolling Stones phase. and i think next, and soon, will be my David Bowie phase. he's really growing on me. like a lot!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Started out listening to country (I know, wtf right?) when I was younger.<br>  Had a short time where I listened to pop stuff (I was young)<br>  Then I hit the classic rock hard and I have never looked back.

fSYDOxX8aa	Well, I don't hate it, but it doesn't compare to their 70s stuff. I've only actually listened through the whole thing once so far so it might still grow on me like The Miracle (album) did. "Cosmos Rockin'", "Still Burnin'" and "Warboys" aren't too bad and it's good to see that Paul Rodgers isn't trying to mimic Freddie (not that anyone could). |`|TEnvIAjraa	Agreed, totally not the same without Freddie =[|`|7vtQnIsTaa	you forgot to put + paul rogers, no big deal tho<br>  <br>  I don't like it sorry I am a huge fan but it sounds like generic classic rock with hints and overtones of Led Zep especially Mays guitar tone it doesn't even sound like mays Signature guitar tone, more like a Page guitar tone. also and of course its not going to be the same without Freddie still though Rogers is so bland mediocre to say the least. However, you will never accurately and correctly fill Freddy's shoes in Queen its just not going to happen, so even with that in mind Rogers blah...my personal favorite was the very last effort and work of Freddie with queen, innuendo.|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Its good, but how can you replace Freddie Mercury ?<br>  One of the most impressive singers to ever take the rock stage.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDckgX3oU_w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDckgX3oU...</a><br>  <br>  Doing all new songs, is ok, but I would not want to see anyone take Freddie's place in concert...nor could they.<br>  <br>  BTW he was the first famous rock star born  in India.  <br>  |`|WOMjtldKaa	I don't have the album but it's on my wish list.

They had an identity, and that is gone now.  I will listen to it, but it won't be the same.|`|NZsC9eI2aa	Good album, you mustn't think about it as Queen with Freddie, it's a new chapter.

91cHXvIbaa	Hi there. This isn't an easy situation. I have been there several times before. The only people that I really hung around with were people who had a really crass sense of humor and didn't really understand me alot of the time. But I remained friends with them for a while...why? Because there was no one else who seemed to want my company and so I just figured I'd take what I could get. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I mean, I didn't want to just ditch them, I didn't feel like they deserved that. (Although I'm pretty sure that my company wouldn't have been missed all that much.) But after a while of this kinda "friendship" I started to see a change in myself. I was cracking all kinds of stupid mindless crass jokes and not really caring about stuff like I used to. I was putting things that used to be at the center of my life on the back burner. I was filling alot of my free time with hanging around them. They were cool people and all, but I just didn't like the effect they were having on me. I don't know if it was because I wasn't sure of who I was or if it was the fact that I was just around them all the time, but whatever it was, I was changing into something I didn't really want to be. It got to a point where I was just like, "Whoa, back up..." and I just took a while to figure things out. <br>  <br>  Now, I didn't just tell you all of this because I like talking about me. My point in telling this is to prove that the people who you hang out with effect you. Being friends with people who are  very different than you can be a really great thing. But it can also be really bad too. If you both don't have respect for what the other one believes, then eventually one of you will find yourself being pushed into something that you don't want to be pushed into.You really gotta be certain of where you stand and what you believe and why you believe it before you start branching out and making friends with people who you can't really share your values with. Does that make sense? I guess I've always believed that close friendship (or any relationship) should be about being there for one another and sharing the most important parts of your lives with one another. It can be really difficult to do that when you guys are polar opposites, ya know?<br>  <br>  So far I feel like I've been speaking in really general terms. So, as far as your specific situation goes, this is what I think you should do:<br>  <br>  Distance yourself. Just because you don't want to be all "buddy buddy" with them doesn't mean that you have to be mean. Find a different table to eat lunch at (and if nobody sits with you, read or do homework...its not that bad)  If they are in your classes, try to find other people to work with during group work. (Also, don't be the initiator. What I mean is, don't be the one to make it a point to go and say,"Hey, how's it going?" If you happen to run into them, just smile and say a simple, "Hey." Pretty soon, if you just make minor adjustments, the friendship will kind of fizzle out. ( I'm not saying avoid them, just create a good distance, that's all.) If any of them ask why you never want to hang out anymore, just be honest. Say that you don't feel like they get you and some of the stuff they do makes you uncomfortable. Mention that its not because you think that thay are bad people, you just don't want to be around them when they do things like that.<br>  <br>  If they get mad, that's not your problem. There's nothing more that you can do. There's always going to be the chance that things will end badly. But its for the best. Its a part of life. And walking away from those friendships may mean that you have no friends for a while...and that's rough. But you can do it. I had to spend alot of nights at home by myself or chillin with my mom. But it gave me a chance to get my head screwed on straight. I re-examined my relationship with GOD and the other things and people in my life that I knew were supposed to be important. I had one other friend at that time. That may happen to you also. But don't worry too much, you won't be lonely forever. If you're patient and look to talk to some people who compliment you more, you will find some friends. (Keep in mind that you won't find somebody who totally agrees with you on everyhting...but if you find people who are more on the same wavelength as you, you'll find that you have more room to be yourself. make sense?) So maybe join a Bible study, prayer group, some kind of club where you can share your interests with others. Remember: figure out who you are, remain strong in what you believe, show kindness to everybody, but CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS CAREFULLY. You really want to make good friends as a freshmen and fall in wth the right crowd. If you get sucked in to the wrong group of people (no matter how nice they may be), you could easily find yourself making some big mistakes that you really don't want to make!<br>  <br>  I guess that's all I can think to say lol. I hope I didn't confuse you too much...I feel l|`|S4XaFPcRaa	You shouldn't because if your with them other people think that you are that kind of person. They'll judge you of who you are. And you don't want that. Most of all they are bad influence to you. Lately, you're going to act like them. Just tell them the truth that you don't like their attitude and practices and if they'll going to kick you out in their group, you better off without them.|`|c5IQCUgKaa	Talk to everyone and you will make friends and become more confident and people will view you differently (in a good way). Just be honest with you friends and if they don't understand then they aren't worth having as friends anyway. They don't seem like good influences at all. Hope this helped.|`|VxE46bSFaa	Try to make more friends that have more similar interests to you. Don't offend your current friends, but if you don't feel comfortable with them, then you should try to just shift towards others that you do feel comfortable with. |`|CkSEpHhzaa	i wouldnt be friends with them. They may ask you to smoke, or other things they do. i know people like that and i try to stay away from them.|`|yovjR4xfaa	You can be their friends without neccesarily doing everything that they do.  They are probably basically good people.  After all, they did accept you into their clan, right?|`|WJ2lbPnGaa	k first ask urself if u really wannna be their friend ?? if yes then try to be a good influence and make them stop smoking and etc. ! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (and i'm in 8th grade)|`|lNuyRiP5aa	if you really dont feel comfortable being around them, then just drift off on your own.  there are plenty of other kids in your school.  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|fYd5lGOkaa	no.  it's hard to live in sodom without picking up a few bad habits.|`|ZadA3kxoaa	you should stop being their friends|`|Lq2psnTqaa	yes it is a little to much right now sorry|`|msQqxMIbaa	Yes.  Stop being friends with them.  I think you know that that is the right thing to do.|`|VJcypcIhaa	Once you find another group you'd like to hang around with, try hanging out with them a few times a week instead of them. If you transition slowly they probably won't make a big deal about it.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you don't say anything mean or they might show you more of that vulgarness, highschool girls seem to like to spread rumors around...|`|jwRcAOtfaa	graudually leave that group.... still talk to them until one day you dont and they wont even notice<br>  1.talk to a couple of different ppl in classes<br>  2. talk to them more<br>  3 ask to sit with them<br>  4 next day sit with your table <br>  5 go off and onn but spend more time with the other table<br>  6 then stop sitting with them|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Yes, it is too much.<br>  Just kidding.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should stay with them. Some of that bad behavior could rub off on you and you wouldn't even know it. Personally, those type of girls at my school wouldn't even care if someone left...they'd get over it quickly. You don't have to say "Hey, I'm leaving you guys 'cause you're jerks!" You can just slowly ease into other groups of friends. My advice -- don't throw yourself onto another group of people because that can get extremely annoying. Think of a mosquito constantly buzzing in your ear. Ugh.|`|Nzg6orwRaa	be a loner it isnt all bad|`|AoUUfzXgaa	No.<br>  You should stick to the morals that have been instilled in you, and if you dont roll the way they do, then you should be out.<br>  If they act like that, it prob wouldnt hurt them for you to leave.<br>  There are 8 billion people in this world, I'm sure you'll make at least 5 friends this year.<br>  Just stop hanging with them!<br>  Their not good for you!<br>  Good luck!|`|HPnVRcgEaa	Ask them to stop;<br>  If they're really your friends they'll stop,<br>  or at least try to not do it so much.<br>  If they don't want to then try and get some new friends;<br>  You want ones that will listen to you,<br>  and care about your feelings.<br>  <br>  <br>  btw: I'm gonna be Mrs. Draco Malfoy,<br>  So I might run into you some day   :)|`|7f932490a85b0ba15fb134215617447baa	Just start hanging out with a better crowd and slowly ease your way out.<br>  <br>  Just remember- if the new group asks you why you don't hang around with them anymore, don't say anything bad about the crowd you're with now. When word gets around (and it will) the older crowd will be out for revenge. |`|h8fp5qs0aa	If you don't feel comfortable with their behaviour you need to find new friends.<br>  <br>  You are going to have to be very brave and stand up for what is know is morally right. |`|Ga2dMpB7aa	I wouldn't stay friends with them if you don't like their values or the way they talk. You don't have to officially stop being friends--just find some new friends, maybe join a club, and then just let them drift.|`|borw2oKCaa	I think that they definitely are bad influences. If you want to be friends with them its fine as long as you stay true to yourself and what kind of person you want to be.|`|fdcbdb56252d1caf7416c0866d1723c2aa	Don't stop being friends with them---just don't hang around them as much.  Make sure that you always be yourself---have you ever thought that you are a good influence on them? |`|R3IlZpfmaa	ditch them! NOW!

LkN5nr6faa	If the crack is on the actual nut, don't freak out. If the crack is on the wood behind the neck, you have some serious tension problems and that is when I would start to worry (not freak out) and just take it to a guitar shop and see what's going on with it. If the crack is on the actual nut though, and it's not affecting the playing and the strings still stay in line, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	He's right.  He obviously knows his guitars.  Don't freak out, it the nut won't affect your sound.  Wouldn't hurt to get it looked at though.

LkN5nr6faa	Members of the jury have spoken, and the Jury reads Guilty on all charges for Aiden, FOB, PATD, MCR, and Avril Lavigne. The preceding bands will receive a sentence of 6 months in Kevin Jonas' closet and a minimum of 100 community service hours. Community service hours must be served by remaining in the audience of a Disney concert. <br>  <br>  I hereby pronounce Coheed and Cambria guilty of a violation, which entails covering the music of a band that is untouchable. A fine of $150 will be instated.|`|69feb1c38fe2bb2c557c2ca3af25447caa	They all get Double Life sentences x2  for committing such atrocities in the world of Music..<br>  <br>  May God have mercy on their souls, because their a$$e$ belong to Bubba....<br>  <br>  No band that commits the crime of "touching the untouchable" deserves to be in a closet with Kevin Jonas, as he is part of a band that "touched an untouchable" as well.. They deserve life in prison with no chance of parole, and intimate evenings  beside the steel toilet with Bubba...|`|8jd2AHJdaa	All of them should be locked up behind bars for all eternity and the key flushed down a sh!t hole.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I sentence them all to DEATH.

YzUQMXJ0aa	I agree with you. When people say that one of the bands I listen to sucks, it doesn't change my view of the band, but it does offend me because I don't think it's necessary or proper for them to say that. You should never say "that band sucks" as if it's a fact. Music is not something that we like because of facts, it's something we like because of our own tastes and how it sounds in our own ears. No one likes it when something special to them gets dissed, so we should all respect each others' opinions and remember that there's no rule book for how to pick what music you like.|`|K1j0cEXfaa	No, if a person is weak and thin-skinned enough to take offense because someone they don't know on the internet says a certain band sucks, that's that person's problem. I'm not here to coddle someone's feelings. I'm mature enough to realize that not everyone likes the same bands that I like. Hearing someone says that a band I like sucks means nothing to me; everyone is entitled to have an opinion.|`|AgQForcYaa	Okay, I'll use an AVGN-inspired comparison of what I'd rather listen to than them (the crappy band). <br>  <br>  "I'd rather listen to diarrhea coming out of a buffalo's @$$!"|`|yhqa5FIXaa	I completely agree with you. but i am guilty of doing it too and i have tried to stop doing it. it would be a nice day when R&P respects each others opinions|`|puIX9aKgaa	Wow, you need to chill.

It is a fact, they have contributed nothing to music other than to dumb it down even more than it already has... if we stop reminding people that it is NOT acceptable to listen to Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, and all of the other trash bands that kids these days listen to they will think that it is totally ok to behave like this in public.  They need to be ground down until they understand their place in the world (the bottom rung of the evolutionary ladder) and in musical taste (somewhere far below the gutter).|`|HNfxDq24aa	I never say anything sucks, mainly because that's an American phrase. I normally say i don't like that band or it's not my thing, or something along those lines.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	I agree with Mother Russia. I never used the word 'suck', but it is time that I start using offensive language.<br>  <br>  Good job, you have just persuaded one of the people that is not part of the problem, to become part of it.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Yes Ok, I won't say Tokio Hotel sucks anymore...<br>  <br>  I'll just say They Bite, Blow, Then Upchuck!!|`|O5xCjej1aa	I don't say suck I say fail but I only do it for Disney trolls that come over in R&P.|`|3dpIt3PIaa	i can say whatever the deuce i want!|`|t7U9rliVaa	Well...okay.<br>  |`|C7YbYUYPaa	Saying that a band sucks most definitely qualifies as an opinion, correct?<br>  <br>  Therefore, why don't you respect that opinion, and learn to live with it.  Some people just hate certain bands, there is no reason for you to get offended by an opinion.|`|69feb1c38fe2bb2c557c2ca3af25447caa	Dear Jonas Brothers:<br>  <br>  Since we have banned the usage of the word "S" in the most fitting word I could ever have used to describe each one of you, I have decided to use a whole new set of words all together..<br>  <br>   And Here they are..<br>  <br>  You three are really awful and stuff at what you do...<br>  <br>  Take Care<br>  H.Walrus..|`|7B2s7maWaa	You have a point.

So I was tired from studying all night, and it was dark, and probably about 20 degrees outside, and it was sleeting.  And the buses weren't running because it was the last day of school and only about 50 students were still there.<br>  So instead of walking back to my dorm, I walk a half mile in the freezing sleet to the parking lot to get my car.  It takes forever, I'm drenched and shivering...and my car won't start.  So I call my mom to include her in on my pity party when my phone dies.  It's at this moment that I just sit in my car and have a good cry.  Then I walk the mile back to my dorm, call the campus police, and ride in the back of a cop car to the parking lot so that she can jump start my car.<br>  <br>  That's only one example of a bad day--I've had several.  I'm also a repeated victim of Murphy's Law.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Ok so I just bought my brand new truck and I was trying to be extra careful with it.

C7YbYUYPaa	Oh my, I'm not sure I will even buy this anymore.  If this is the only one you like, than I would hate to listen to the rest.  That was so unoriginal, dull, and was nothing like Queen ever did.<br>  <br>  I think it is time for Brian and Roger to call it a career, they are great artists, but they can't keep doing this.|`|7vtQnIsTaa	Hey Stone, can I just paste what I shard with another Gal last night?<br>  <br>  I just don't like the new record that much I mean its good it really is but and I am not going to sit here and tell something that's not true I was let down with the new one and it might have something to do that Freddie is not there as I tried to keep an open heart and mind to Rodgers who isn't a bad vocalist just not for me not my taste. The new one sounds more like Classic Rock like Led Zep type of Classic Rock there isn't that anthem theme and overtone on the record and Mays guitar tone is not even his classic signature guitar tone it sounds more like a Jimmy Page guitar tone. my favorite record to this day is the Last Effort with freddie at least Original Composition effort with him Innuendo, it was both Dark and Optimistic take the title track for example some of Queens most Deepest Lyrical work, Dark Musical Overtones I love the Flamenco Nylon Classical guitar work of May on that track.<br>  |`|vEtub0lkaa	In my personal opinion, Queen died with Freddie.  If they want to keep making music, they should change their name.  It will never be the same and by keeping the name they are living in the past. Not that I blame them, of course, but they want to keep the Golden Days with them but they are long gone.  They have been since 1991.|`|YSrWe0LEaa	Queen isn't the same without Freddie because he was Queen but i still respect Brian and the rest of the band<br>  <br>  R.I.P.

K4Nt8kZPaa	Every day is a Pink Floyd day for me =]|`|gO2brrDbaa	The other day was a Grateful Dead day. I woke up to Scarlet Begonias, then a bunch of their songs came on shuffle while I was on the bus, then they got mentioned in TWO books I was reading, and then in art I read another book about them! It was pretty cool.<br>  Today wasn't any particular day, but I found a bunch of Jackson Browne CDs in the basement, so now I can get more into him.|`|AA11473184	That's freaky! Today has been a Pink Floyd day for me too.<br>  Mainly because I had Maths, and my teacher loves them, so he got them stuck in my head, haha.|`|sZwGlfsbaa	Today has been southern rock day for me. |`|OCnrcoBOaa	I've had many of those days. Today, it has been a Buddy Guy kind of day.<br>  |`|nU7yv87Vaa	Yup, happens every day practically. Today has been a Nazareth day for me.

And also "Wish You Were Here".  :)|`|NQ37mnWkaa	It happens to me every so often...<br>  I more commonly have 'band nights' ~ what I listen to in bed.<br>  <br>  The main ones I can remember are :~<br>  Fleetwood Mac<br>  Blackmore's Night<br>  Old Blind Dogs<br>  The Beatles<br>  Jethro Tull<br>  Led Zeppelin<br>  Meat Loaf<br>  Capercaillie<br>  <br>  Today is a Shelagh McDonald day {night / early morning} ...<br>  <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=KS6QtpAfbh4" rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=KS6QtpAfbh...</a>|`|ssoZ33XIaa	Yeah, very often a band just perfectly fits my mood, or the events, of a whole day.  The other day was very much a The Ataris kind of day for some reason.|`|xgF6W3E6aa	Oh definitely! When I got ready for work this morning I listened to 'Here come the Bastards' by Primus. And all day long it kepting playing in my head especially when I seen a group of supervisors heading my way!|`|3dpIt3PIaa	lol, it seemed like a Zeppelin day for me! =D<br>  <br>  Pink Floyd days rock!!!!|`|sZ43o3r7aa	Today was a very Neil Young day... I just had Prairie Winds playing non stop. Especially It's A Dream.<br>  <br>  Somehow on a cloudy lonely day, it just felt appropriate to put on some Neil Young and stare at the clouds pass. <br>  <br>  There were many other days where I was going by themed bands.... Floyd happens to be one of them. |`|g5DvuTOIaa	 Really? Yesterday and today have been Pink Floyd days for me too. <br>   Last night, my dad was kind enough to blast Wish You Were Here in the car for me. <br>   Their songs are just fitting my mood right now... <br>   I have had a lot of those days. It is usually a different band every day. |`|7vtQnIsTaa	I have had many many many many many many many many Pink Floyd days myself =)|`|7B2s7maWaa	Yes many many many times.

C7YbYUYPaa	I'd be back, but I would spend almost all of my efforts on the classic rock.  Most of my knowledge is classic rock, and I'm not much help on alot of questions in this section.|`|vEnmF72Xaa	I really like R&P, the people in here know their music.<br>  <br>  Only thing that annoys me is when certain questions *cough* Jonas Brothers *cough*....anything to do with that piece of sh*t of a band gets like 40 answers all the time, but when people ask questions about real music they hardly get any answers.|`|nhk5zzaeaa	I'd tell all the regulars to boycott the classic rock section.  Splitting us up isn't cool, plus there is enough classic rock talk here anyways : )|`|KKx8Mb63aa	I'd go there once in a while but I'm not a huge fan of classic rock.|`|TlU3zj61aa	def come back!|`|sZwGlfsbaa	It would take a lot for me to leave R&P. I love it here. I don't think there is rehab for R&P. ( and I love classic rock )|`|lztLa9FGaa	i'm not too into classic rock, so i'd most likely stay here. |`|jyPCm1evaa	I could never leave this place cold turkey. I'd come back :D|`|2p7u0RAeaa	No way...I like classic rock but it is not the main genre I listen to...but I would appear less frequently if there was a punk/post-punk/new wave kind of section:P|`|1eu7WNCmaa	I'd come back. I don't ONLY listen to classic rock.|`|kILkOc6saa	I'd frequent both. I happen to love both kinds.|`|nU7yv87Vaa	I'd boycott the classic rock section...<br>  <br>  Splitting up R&P is not cool.|`|xgF6W3E6aa	I like classic, but it doesn't rule my world. And R&P covers all rock. If you suggest splitting R&P, then why not a Metal, or Punk, or a 90's alternative section? If you did that then I would frequent the 90's alternative more than the other sections. I think the grass is greener right here.|`|rR6lwxjjaa	nope, i would visit there every once in awhile but mostly i would still stay here.<br>  <br>  i love classic rock, but not enough to live there :)|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Nope|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	No.
AA10569146	Van Halen- Eddie and Alex shared the spot light with DLR<br>  <br>  Led Zepplin- Plant,page and Bonham had about equal press time as well as stage time and admiration<br>  <br>  KISS-With all the make up and the sharing of singing duties all 4 members were recognized<br>  <br>  Poison- All 4 members were flamboyant and played the Rock Star card<br>  <br>  Metallica-Musicianship and a war with Napster put them in the media,especially lars and James... plus a movie about them didnt hurt either<br>  <br>  Velvet Revolver- With the lead singer from STP and 3 members from GnR 4 of these band members shared time in the spotlight<br>  <br>  Rolling Stones- Weaving guitar riffs between the medical miracle Keith and Ron Wood definatley gives Mick company at the spotlight<br>  <br>  RUSH- With each member a virtuoso in their own right all 3 share the spotlight equally|`|gDxMoBl9aa	The only member of Led Zeppelin that stayed in the background was John Paul Jones. Everything else about Led Zeppelin was as splashy and flamboyant as it gets. It's hard to say who was the bigger "flaunt it in the face of the World" Rockstar between Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. John Bonham was just basically mayhem incorporated. And their Manager Peter Grant, and Tour Manager Richard Cole were two of the most outrageous thugs and gangsters the English Music scene ever produced. Led Zeppelin set an impossibly high standard of outrageousness for other Bands to follow.|`|s03m87cGaa	I gotta say Rush.  Neil may be even more known than Geddy, and even though Alex is overlooked, Just about everyone still knows who he is.<br>  Also:<br>  Fleetwood Mac<br>  Pink Floyd<br>  Lynyrd Skynyrd|`|i4NkPeATaa	Gun N Roses man! Axl Rose suffered from LSD (lead singer disease) but the other band members made a name for them selves. Everyone knows Slash, the lead guitarist. |`|LkN5nr6faa	Motley Crue without a doubt. They really made a name for themselves in LA in the 1980s. Between Tommy breaking windows in cop cars and pissing in the back seat and Nikki being technically dead for a few minutes, then leaving the hospital when he recovered to cook up the biggest batch of heroin in his life, it's hard not to recognize the debauchery the band has produced. Now, Nikki is clean and makes you wonder if he is even the same person that was in Motley Crue. The band is full of awesome personalities. I think every single member of the Crue is equally strong. They are all we recognized for their own things. They are the most undynamic set of 4 ever, but they still made it work.|`|rFBypeEfaa	First thing coming to mind is GWAR, but i feel like that's too easy since they're acting out characters anyhow, not actually known personalities themselves (not to mention the musicians have changed even though the costumes are the same, so really it's the opposite: the musicians are totally UNknown.)<br>  <br>  migh is certainly right about the Dolls and Kiss.<br>  <br>  Some others...<br>  <br>  The Ramones: Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee for sure. Tommy and Marky held their own for recognition, as well.<br>  <br>  The Monkees: Davy Jones, Mike Nesmith, Micky Dolenz, and Peter Tork... we saw plenty of all 4 on TV, of course!<br>  <br>  Motley Crue: Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, and even Mick Mars are all pretty individually known...<br>  <br>  Cream was kind of a supergroup (all of which I was avoiding because they are obvious, like ELP and CSNY), but Clapton, Bruce, and Baker were definitely more well known for having been in Cream than most other things...|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Queen is like that.<br>  <br>  Obviously Freddie Mercury gets all the press and fame, and it he was very deserving, but the other guys got quite a bit of press too.<br>  <br>  Brian May and Roger Taylor each were very vocal and did a ton of interviews both together and seperate. Roger was probably the second most flamboyant member of Queen, but there was no way he would ever outshine Freddie.  <br>  <br>  BA:  Coming from the same band, John Deacon was the one that people didn't know hardly anything about.  He wrote some of Queen's key songs like Another One Bites The Dust and Friends Will Be Friends, but he stayed in the shadows, because let's face it, the bass player never gets any love.|`|WIguyGcZaa	Definitely The Beatles(: I mean who could forget that they were nicknamed by their personalities? that's awesome!! For those of you that don't remember:<br>  John Lennon- The Smart One<br>  Paul McCartney- The Cute One<br>  George Harrison- The Quiet One because he was always so shy and quiet:) and<br>  Ringo Starr- The Shy One because he was always shy:)<br>  <br>  BQ: Probably Ringo Starr and George Harrison because they hardly ever got the chance to sing like John and Paul did.<br>  Hope I helped!!|`|Lngb8ryFaa	motley crue stand out the most....vince neil in jail for DUI/manslaughter, Tommy Lee with his pamela anderson scandal, Nikki Sixx for ODing on heroine and being "resurrected", all of them being notorious for sex drugs n rock n roll...they really were the bad boys of rock n roll in the 80's|`|5292c54ca6f10000abfcca621a4f8806aa	The Birthday Massacre<br>  <br>  Usually in other bands during interviews and stuff, the singer speaks for all but in this band, at least for the "regular" members of the band, the singer lets them speak for themselves|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	i'd say the new york dolls. david johansen, sylvain sylvain, arthur 'killer' kane, jerry nolan (to a lesser extent) and of course the late great johnny thunders! all great characters!<br>  <br>  'jet boy'- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2cQPln0Fr8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2cQPln0F...</a><br>  <br>  ...and kiss!

Maybe the Rolling Stones? Keith is VERY well known. Brian I think was well known as well. Bill Wyman...well, if he wasn't well known before he married that young girl he certainly was after. I think most people knew/know Charlie also.|`|VFpiph4maa	The Beatles all the way you cant even watch a press Conference with them without having a huge smile spread across your face! they were just Hilarius! loved how they shared a laugh with each other to! everyone knows the 4 boys they were so memorable!|`|2YHJZwksaa	The Rolling Stones - Keith Richards <br>  Jane's Addiction - Dave Navarro<br>  Alice in Chains - Jerry Cantrell <br>  RHCP - Flea/ Frusciante|`|vDjG7omcaa	Dave mustain eo Megadeth <br>  <br>  he was playin in Metallica in his early years|`|9hCezzwRaa	KISS-Everyone knows Gene, Paul, Ace & Peter.

James Brown for soul!!!!|`|2p7u0RAeaa	Dream Theater would be a good example I think.I'm not a massive fan,but they've been called a 'supergroup'- people who like them equally appreciate all members for their musicianship.<br>  <br>  The Velvet Underground does belong to this category too,since when they're mentioned not only Lou Reed,but also Nico(not officially a member,but oh well) and John Cale come to mind-and they always made more sense as a band/group...<br>  <br>  Post-rock bands (usually) don't have a frontman,so everybody tends to think of them as a group(GY!BE is the best-known eopposite.<br>  <br>  The opposite would be the case with Joy Division for example...

ETFaQiTzaa	All of Kings of Leon's songs are simple enough for them to perform live, so they don't change it up too often.<br>  <br>  But they put more feeling into the live version of "Arizona" in my opinion.

I saw them play it live, touring on Brighten the Corners and was actually mildly disappointed when I first got Terror Twilight because it wasn't as heavy and as cool as the album version is it lacked something that the live version provided. Apparently, at least according to Malkmus when they played it live that first time, it was actually inspired by Black Sabbath.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	Great question!!<br>  I absolutely love both, but I have to say the live version of Sigur Rós--Hoppípolla/Meo Blódnasir, in this recording, has to be my favorite and one that I usually listen to when I want to hear this song.

z87Bx9Qhaa	Yes. People get way to worked up over something that may or may not even exist. We as humanity shut people out or lock them in according to their religious behaviour and beliefs. While most of this generation is doubtful, there is still many thick-skulled people who don't give a damn about an actual person, just what 'god' they worship.<br>  It's insanity.<br>  <br>  MQ: The Rolling Stones<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if i came off as a bumbling idiot, i tried to explain best i could|`|Nt1ISIu4aa	I never thought religion had a substantial negative side before but you do offer a different perspective. I think life has the potential to be better if organized religion were abolished, but not neccessarily for everyone. Some people need somewhere to go and something to believe in, so what the result of getting rid of organized religion would be varies from person to person. For some, it has a positive affect, but others could be negatively affected.<br>  <br>  MQ: The Stones :)<br>  <br>  And btw, yesterday was David Lee Roth's birthday!<br>  HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAVE!!! :)|`|AA11187638	Yes, the world would indeed be a better place without religion, and it is one of the biggest obstacles to turning humanity into a truly global civilisation.<br>  <br>  MA: Wings. Stones are overrated.|`|ETFaQiTzaa	I think that there would be a lot of advantages to having no religion, but there would be a lot of downsides, too.  First of all, I'm absolutely f*cking -sick- of people like Fred Phelps who take the Bible WAY too literally.  They pick up certain phrases and -twist- it to their advantage, changing the original meaning.  -Anyone- who can picket a funeral without feeling absolutely worthless is a horrible excuse of a human being--I don't care whose funeral it was.  THAT is one of the pitfalls of religion--that they can validate hate using a message that was meant to save and redeem.<br>  <br>  That said, some people need to believe in a greater being/purpose.  Some people need to hope.  Like someone said, we'd still find reasons to have wars--over stupid insignificant things.  Religion is just the most acceptable cover.<br>  <br>  I, for one, am not sure what I believe at the moment.  I feel like I'm a transcendentalist born in the wrong century, and I hold -morals- in higher esteem than any god.  If more people went along with what -they- felt was right, rather than what a book, or some fanatic told them, then the world might be a better place.<br>  <br>  MA:  The Rolling Stones.  I'm not too crazy about them, but other than "Live and Let Die," I'm not really familiar with Wings' work.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	It's not necessarily organized religion that is the problem, it is the people within these organizations.  People get so uptight about religion and think that it is somehow their duty to put down and hate on members of other religions. |`|wLxmn2xtaa	I think that religion has a lot to offer but organized religion has certainly contributed to more wars and bigotry like you said. Overall, I'd say yeah.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	I really do think that Religion has caused many problems and many things in Science to not be discovered<br>  <br>  <br>  MQ:The Rolling Stones|`|9ntoGPFyaa	Without religion, a majority of the countries wouldn't exist. Pilgrims settled in this dirt for religious tolerance. Think about it.|`|t7U9rliVaa	I think so.<br>  But I can't say for sure. Maybe all hell (no pun intended?) would break loose if it was done away with.  Who knows.<br>  <br>  MQ: Stones|`|DibFrwxlaa	No.  We'd just fight over something else.  If not religion than some other facet of people's identities.  Sure you can point to a bunch of wars inspired by religious differences but I can point to just as many inspired by ideology, nationalism, scarcity of resources, and so on.  <br>  <br>  Religious organizations also do plenty of good around the world.  Schools, hospitals, various poverty programs, hell the Catholic Church and Pope John Paul II helped bring down the Soviets.<br>  <br>  MA:  Stones by far.|`|wXv50mNEaa	As much as I like John Lennon, "Imagine" was a stupid song. People like to say religion is the root of all evil, but in reality evil people just use religion for their own evil purposes. Good people use religion for good purposes. This is something of a generalization, of course.<br>  <br>  MQ: To quote Royal Trux, "Is that a ******* question?" The Stones.|`|MYsSyfQzaa	Yes, it would be a happier co-existence with everyone. I mean I practice Wicca and get bashed on "why don't you believe in God?" or the classic funny but ignorant "can you fly on a broomstick?". I hate it so, yes no religion would be perfect<br>  <br>  MQ- Rolling Stones|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	absolutely! 'personal' religion should be the only thing that matters... and it should be a religion of acceptance of other religions/faiths/beliefs/points of view... whatever...NO-ONE tells me what i should think or believe...<br>  <br>  wings. the stones haven't found my g- spot yet... and i love 'band on the run'!|`|fzqMOD4Waa	Well without organized religion, no church. With no church, no gospel. With no gospel, no Rock and Roll.<br>  <br>  Thus Religion has it's place.<br>  <br>  MQ: Stones|`|7B2s7maWaa	Yes I  believe so.  I definitely think the world would be better off and people would just be happier in general.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  MA:Stones|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Absolutely.  But don't blame men, after all, a lot of Queens forced wars based on religion.<br>  <br>  MA: Wings|`|KKx8Mb63aa	In my opinion it would be.

The new Manson is tired, old and safe...there is nothing shocking about him anymore.His biggest drawcard was his image no denying, without his carefully crafted shocking image nobody would even know who he is today.<br>  <br>  Muse I can't get into because they can't write any decent lyrics. Yes I know Matthew has a beautiful voice...but where is the soul and substance? He sings the worst lyrics imaginable...that's why Muse can never be compared to Radiohead.<br>  <br>  I was hoping that said Elliott Smith instead of Elliot Minor...oh well.|`|k7jGZydJaa	Death Cab For Cutie  I don't know them well enough to rate<br>  Muse (for Sabrina is A Fan Of Muse)   6.5/10<br>  Escape The Fate 1/10<br>  Hellogoodbye  1/10<br>  Brokencyde Don't know them<br>  Mayday Parade  1/10<br>  Sixx: AM Don't know them<br>  Marilyn Manson 3.8/10<br>  Armor For Sleep 1/10<br>  Elliot Minor  Don't know him<br>  We The Kings  1/10<br>  All Time Low 1/10<br>  3oh!3 Don't know them<br>  Self Against City Don't know them<br>  <br>  <br>  The ones I have rated are ones I have heard actual albums from (my best friend loves pop-punk)|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	Death Cab For Cutie 8<br>  Muse 6<br>  Escape The Fate 4<br>  Hellogoodbye 5<br>  Brokencyde 0<br>  Mayday Parade 3<br>  Sixx: AM 5<br>  Marilyn Manson 4<br>  Armor For Sleep 5<br>  Elliot Minor 3<br>  We The Kings 3<br>  All Time Low 3<br>  3oh!3 0<br>  Self Against City 3<br>  |`|AA12298546	Death Cab For Cutie- 6<br>  Muse -?<br>  Escape The Fate- 9<br>  Hellogoodbye-8<br>  Brokencyde- ?<br>  Mayday Parade _ 7<br>  Sixx: AM -6<br>  Marilyn Manson - 8<br>  Armor For Sleep-9<br>  Elliot Minor_?<br>  We The Kings-?<br>  All Time Low-?<br>  3oh!3-?_<br>  Self Against City-?<br>  |`|AgQForcYaa	Myeeeeeh....

I love Queen!!|`|HNfxDq24aa	Well i only have 3 albums<br>  Greatest Hits 1,2,3|`|fSYDOxX8aa	1. A Day at the Races.<br>  A lot of songs I like on this one, "Somebody to Love", "Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy", and "The Millionaire Waltz". Also like "You and I" (don't know why they never played that live) and "Drowse" is probably my favourite track written by Roger Taylor (behind Rock It (Prime Jive)). Tough picking between this album and A Night at the Opera.<br>  <br>  2. Queen (first album)<br>  Highly underrated. "Keep Yourself Alive" is one of the best album openers ever, and this album contains "Liar" and "Son and Daughter". Their sound on this album is harder than any of their subsequent albums.<br>  <br>  3. Queen II<br>  Like the black and white side thing, and the over the top fantasy lyrics (especially on "Ogre Battle" and "March of the Black Queen").<br>  <br>  A Night at the Opera and Sheer Heart Attack come very close (and I also have a weird thing for the Flash Gordon soundtrack). Pretty tough picking a top three.<br>  <br>  My least favourite would be A Kind of Magic.  While it does have "One Vision" and "Who Wants to Live Forever" on it, I just never really got into "Pain is so Close to Pleasure", "Don't Lose Your Head" or "Gimme the Prize".|`|3w1TKncvaa	Yours answers are pretty good, I'd say<br>  <br>  1. Sheer Heart Attack<br>  <br>  2. Queen II<br>  <br>  3. A Night At The Opera (don't like best friend though!)<br>  <br>  Worst would also be Hot Space.<br>  <br>  Not sure about them being 4 most beautiful people though, I prefer ladies... lol|`|Wb59rFmgaa	1. Jazz<br>  2. A night at the Opera (You're my Best friend is ok, my favorite on that album is Love of my life)<br>  3. News of the World<br>  <br>  I agree with you on Hot Space, though I do love "Under pressure" |`|C7YbYUYPaa	Tough to choose.<br>  <br>  1. A Night At The Opera<br>  2. Jazz<br>  3. The Game<br>  <br>  I agree that Hot Space is the worst.  They got too far away to what Queen was really all about, and it showed.|`|nhk5zzaeaa	Eh this is a hard question........but here it goes...<br>  <br>  1. A Night At The Opera.......leaves me breathless everytime, plus come on Bohemian freaking Rhapsody is on there.  I'm going to get the artwork tattooed onto my hip, how cool would it be to have a tattoo designed by Mercury himself!!?<br>  <br>  2. Sheer Heart Attack....yeah this album basically gives me that but in a good way, if thats possible. Killer Queen, Brighton Rock, Stone Cold Crazy, Flick Of The Wrist, Lily Of The Valley, Dear Friends, I could go on but yeah this is one of my faves...<br>  <br>  3. Queen I......I'm really into their early stuff. I love love love their later work also, but I seem to lean towards the stuff they did when they were first coming out.  This is their very first album, it has Liar, one of my faves, Keep Yourself Alive, Doin' Alright, Jesus, and Mad The Swine among others. Just pure Queen I absolutely love it!<br>  <br>  Great Question!<br>  I am a big fan of Under Pressure though...<br>  <br>  My least fave? Yeah I'm with you there....
C7YbYUYPaa	Yea, he is most definitely a key part of Queen songs, but I don't think even he could help this new album.  <br>  <br>   He even said himself that Freddie Mercury WAS Queen, and there could never be a Queen without Freddie.  I think he was on to something with that, becuase even with John's bass guitar and lyrics, you can tell something is missing.  <br>  <br>  They needed John, but without Freddie, it will never, ever have the same feeling.|`|WOMjtldKaa	Yeah, I agree. If he was with the band The Cosmos Rocks would be more similar to a Queen album. But the album is very similar to the other Queen songs even if there isn't Freddie, the music is very similar.|`|UxWjVGrGaa	i doubt that deacon will make any changes.he is a good fella but he lacks the "rock attitude"
C7YbYUYPaa	Yea it is alright for a starter pack.  The amp is pretty small, and you can't do a whole lot with it, but since you get 3 picks, a strap, an amp, the guitar, and an instructional video I would recommend it.<br>  <br>  You can always get a better one later on.|`|oUZLZusjaa	I wouldn't reccomend it. It's a good starter pack thing, but I guarantee you that in a year when you start to get good on guitar you'll want something better.
b1RgKHoiaa	I would tell yuo to go and try them out first..thats like the best thing to do before..and to see if they got it..=)<br>  <br>   please answer mine..thnks <^> <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag8_AizvrW9K0mnEu4bjgsHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081006200641AAv5VAL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I have found Fender Strats to be one of the most versatile guitars available.  Ahead of the Strat would be the Fender Tele.<br>  <br>  The only way the Fender American Standard Strat could be better, other than a custom-built guitar, would be the Fender American Deluxe Strat which adds S-1 switching adding even more versatile.<br>  <br>  <br>  The only electric guitars I would recommend at this time would be Fender Strats and Teles.  They're built very well, they last a long time and they sound great no matter what genre you play.  Both Strats and Teles can be heard in rock, metal, country, blues, jazz and probably a whole lot more!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	 You can play any genre on a strat, and they are great guitars.  Go for the strat.|`|lCWeznyKaa	Go to guitar store and try it out to see if you like it |`|HDYxx5j2aa	go with the ibanez because strats are for heavy metal people(i hate heavy metal)

It was hilarious but I was a little embarress.<br>  <br>  Also at school we have this computer lab and everytime I am leaving from it I pull the door when really I need to push it.

pLPKo6mBaa	" I refuse to listen to anything past 1992, unless it is an old band making new songs."<br>  <br>  Is that supposed to be something to be proud of? Wow. That's like me saying I refuse to listen to anything before 1992.<br>  <br>  I love when people try to pass off ignorance and stubborness as opinions. It's hilarious. Makes me all tingly inside.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	i agree, lots of people that are classic rock fans are closed minded about new music. sure, new music sucks...but only MAINSTREAM music sucks. indie and underground bands are awesome.<br>  <br>  i love classic rock, but i'm more into the 90's and present stuff.<br>  <br>  there are SOOO MANY good modern bands, their just missing out!<br>  examples:<br>  <br>  priestess<br>  the trews!!!<br>  the black keys<br>  attack in black<br>  the flatliners<br>  the salads<br>  SLOAN!!!<br>  oasis<br>  the white stripes<br>  the raconteurs<br>  the red hot chili peppers<br>  the strokes<br>  the arctic monkeys<br>  <br>  i mean, i could go on forever!|`|vFrnGtiDaa	I agree.  Those thumbs up and thumbs down games completely show it too.  If someone mentions a band that no one has heard of, they still get a load of thumbs down.  It is really stupid.<br>  <br>  MQ: Grudge because that whole genre seemed to all die at once when Kurt Cobain died.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Thanks, Vicky.  I am glad you at least agree with me.|`|To5mQxOPaa	I don't think i'm a dick, haha. I like several new bands, but i also know the new bands that I DONT like too. To some extent, i can appreciate people's taste in music...(unless they're in their 20's and like jonas brothers, haha)<br>  <br>  MQ: Grunge probably did.|`|AA12135515	Said it before & saying it again- This is one classic rock fan who is Always on the lookout for good new music. As it says on my profile.|`|un2xSpRRaa	I'm a classic rock fan, and I hate a sh*tload of modern bands, but not just because they're modern, because they suck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Glam Metal.|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	Yeah, they're not that bad, they just have to realize that different people enjoy different things.<br>  <br>  MQ: I think Grunge did...|`|qlcY8aKFaa	It's only there opinion unless they take it to far|`|n22BTpK5aa	"i've always said glam stands for gay LA metal" lemmy kilmister<br>  <br>  but yeah glam died out real quick like a fish out of water|`|PSDAp5Wxaa	Glam Metal definintely brought in more money, Grunge connected deeper with its fans.<br>  <br>  Honestly I don't like either that much.|`|79da0611886f411e4afb19dfff79ade7aa	modern bands stink because that's what they put out, i guess i really don't understand your question. Grudge did, it rocked though.|`|gNsm2tYZaa	grudge<br>  ahahaha where is ur gay son eric??<br>  aha jk <br>  THAT 70'S SHOW ROCKS!!!!|`|gDxMoBl9aa	I don't go for that whole "All New Music sucks" Crap either. It's ridiculous and Close-Minded.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's kind of idiotic to say all Music from before a certain date sucks too.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  I challenge anyone to actually listen to Opeth, Nightwish, Stratovarius, Firewind, or Porcupine Tree and then tell Me all new music "sucks"<br>  <br>  *Edit 2*<br>  Glam & Hair Metal..NOT NOT NOT the same thing.|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	I dunno. I always try and give a band some what of a chance, and I usally listen to them once and don't like them, then, a couple month's later, I try again and change my mind.<br>  <br>  MQ: Grunge|`|7B2s7maWaa	I don't really have a problem with it I listen to classic rock but I also listen to a lot of stuff from today and everything.  Different preferences and opinions not that big of a deal to me. For the most part I see a classic rock fan user list at least one band from today that they like and they really are not that bad at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  MA: Glam Metal|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I have found that most modern rock artists aren't very good at all.  In fact, that's why, instead of sticking to rock, I started listening to country.  I mean, Brad Paisley is one of the best guitarists alive (check him out, if you haven't already).<br>  <br>  Of course, every era of music, no matter how bad, does usually have some talent hidden somewhere.  For 80's metal, there was Cinderella and quite a few others.<br>  <br>  <br>  MQ:  Grudge died faster...I mean, glam bands are still touring and making quite a bit of money.  Some are even coming out with new material.  Grudge, on the other hand, seems to be almost completely dead...except for the few Nirvana fans left, which I think were completely overrated.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  One great modern band that's one of my personal favorites is Cross Canadian Ragweed.  Many people don't know who they are at all.  One reason for this may be the fact that their stupid record label labeled them as country when they're obviously rock!  Give 'em a listen sometime--you won't be sorry...especially if you love great blues-influenced rock!|`|ONWCXzUMaa	As I said before I love all kinds of music. Music is what keeps us alive whether it's man made or made by nature. What  I like about today's music it's the same as the old music in that it keeps all together and talking. And as long as people are talking we are learning.<br>  Thanks everyone for making me a little bit better.<br>  Rock On|`|RKMWeMk9aa	One thing that annoys me here, are the people that post questions about rock being dead, which in my opinion is nonsense, there are plenty of good bands out there stop relying on MTV and the radio and go look for it.<br>  <br>  MQ: Glam

From 1970 - 1975 you had two flavors of rock/pop going on. The hard rock groups building on the sixty sound. <br>  Led Zeppelin, The Who, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc..<br>  The softer side building on the folk sound. <br>  Dobbie Brothers. Simon & Garfunkel, Elton John etc...<br>  Then around 1975/76 the Southern Rock sound took off.<br>  Lynard Skynard, Marshall Tucker. Allman Brothers<br>  Then in 78/79 came Disco. Everybody had burnt out on the Rock sound.<br>  Donna Summer, Bee Gees<br>  So that's how it went down. I can't remember them all off the top of my head. I did live threw the 70's and loved every minute of it. <br>  Download and listen to these groups and artists top tracks during that decade and you'll get a true flavor for the times. |`|XkwiY5F8aa	artists=pink floyd,running wild songs=death or glory,wish you werehere,maggie may,iron man,fox on the run,one way out(lords of dogtown soundtrack)|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Led Zeppelin<br>  Neil Young<br>  Yes<br>  Elton John<br>  <br>  Hard to go wrong with these....|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Queen<br>  Boston<br>  Journey<br>  Foreigner<br>  Led Zeppelin<br>  Bad Company<br>  Heart

They're actually really good...I didn't like them at first because I though Alex Turner would be leaving, but thank goodness he's not. They're quite different from the Arctic Monkeys. They're going to be doing a new album in 2009 :)|`|DZX1XiQ5aa	there ok|`|hF0orCbVaa	I am somewhat of a fan.<br>  I used to listen to them quite a bit.  I don't know when/if they're releasing a third LP, but I hope they change it up next time.  Their first two were very decent, but if they continue on this path, people will get bored.<br>  <br>  Favorite songs: Balaclava, The Bakery, Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured, 505, Too Much To Ask, A Certain Romance.<br>  <br>  Lol, that reminds me, they also did a little tarty cover of "Baby I'm Yours" and I have to admit, it's a little too sweet for them but it was a nice surprise.<br>  <br>  Alex Turner didn't "join", he just collaborated with the frontman for Rascals.  I'm sure it's just a side project; he's not separating from the Arctic Monkeys.  If somehow Turner could get some of that sound and maybe plug it into his Arctic Monkeys, that'd be good.  Because the Shadow Puppets debut was awful.  I didn't like it at all.  All the tracks sounded similar except one or two.|`|6WFIXIWfaa	They are a great band.  In fact, they are one of my favourites.  Their best songs are Leave Before the Lights Go On, Baby I'm Yours, Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts, The Bakery, A Certain Romance, Do Me A Favour, and a whole bunch of others.  Alex Turner is doing a side project with the Miles Kane, in the Last Shadow Puppets, who are also great (my favourite song is The Meeting Place).|`|OnfX196naa	I heard the album is coming out early 2009.<br>  My fav A.M. songs would be Fake Tales of San Francisco, When the Sun goes Down, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor, Brianstorm, Dancing Shoes, Riot Van, Old Yellow Bricks, D is for Dangerous, well, basically, I love all their songs!<br>  Alex didn't join the Last Shadow Puppets. It was only a side project.<br>  I was worried sick at the time, cause I thought he was leving them completely! Thankfully, thats not the case.|`|uOa2dylZaa	i love them i like i bet you look good dancing on the dance floor<br>  flourescent

They are nowehere near as good as their fans make them out to be. Just an ok band who happened to be in the right scene at the right time and Cobain died at the right time.

You're not the only one.  I personally love them, but who cares??  I have never seen "Goonies" or any of the "Back to the Future" movies.  (I was born in 1983.)  Everyone gives me crap about it, but...who cares??  You like what you like.  It's no one else's business|`|IjCNhYa0aa	I personally like them. but that doesn't make you weird for not liking them. everyone has their own personal taste in music.

oYNqNkk5aa	Overrated or not, the Nicholson Shining is considered a "great film."  As a result, no production company will put money into remaking it right - people in the industry aren't likely to see enough of a profit margin.   The best you can hope for is a made-for-tv remake with C-list stars, because that's cheaper to produce.  I'm sorry to say it, but that's the way it is.<br>  <br>  I disagree with your casting choices too... Bale and Watts would probably be good in the roles, but they've been over-cast in similar ones before.  If they want to preserve some sort of professional integrity, they'd never take on a project like this.  You're better off finding actors with equal skill who haven't done something like this before.  Morgan Freeman may be right for Dick Hallorann, but I'm not sure.  I bet you could do better.  Is Scatman Crothers too old/too dead to reprise the role?<br>  <br>  David Fincher could be a good choice for a director (though he didn't direct Big Fish - Tim Burton did).  A skillful screenwriter would also have to be attached to the project, because adapting Stephen King into something that makes sense is not an easy task.  Maybe the Coen brothers could take it on...they haven't done horror in a while.<br>  <br>  All things considered, it could well be an improvement on the '70s Nicholson version, but it ain't happening.|`|2ef430adc8e915f644395c36250a3c50aa	Wow - never thought of Bale as Jack Torrance, but that would be a perfect role for him. I agree - that is a moviethat should be remade. I know there was a tv version with Steven Weber years ago, but that one didn't do it for me either. It's one of my fave Steve King books, but no one has REALLY done it justice in my opinion. Not sure if I agree about Naomi Watts tho - maybe Evangaline Lilly from Lost??|`|WPt9bivgaa	Naomi Watts?! Let me stop you before you make a travesty. If they re-make this movie I wish they would emphasize on method acting, with the influence of Italian Neo-Realism film techniques. I want the movie to appear real and they could start by choosing actors that I don't relate to twenty different films. |`|tplsDlMuaa	I can not tell you how much The Shining scared me. I could not go to sleep for one week! It didn't make any sense at all to me and it was sort of bad acting in my opinion. But besides that, it was a classic horror film and no remake could compare to the orginal. So no, they should not make a remake.|`|I8nIewQHaa	Well not sure about the cast you would like but I do think they should re make it. That would be interesting to see what they would do to make it more in the now. |`|36bTrxHfaa	No way, the original would be almost impossible to top.

Faithful to the novel. Which wasn't that good.<br>  <br>  Anthony Burgess had similar complaints about Clockwork Orange. He went and made a stage play of it, mocking Kubrick. The play was ****.<br>  <br>  The ensemble you've put together could do something more interesting I think. Like film And The As.s Saw The Angel <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_the_***_Saw_the_Angel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_the_***...</a>|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	HECK NO!  I love that movie!.......It is perfect and it still scares the crap out of me!|`|f2XhfAoIaa	No one could play Jack better than Jack Nicholson. He did a great job at the acting. His acting was like the best thing in the whole movie and the most terrifying.<br>  Ok ya Shelley Duvall was not very good, but I don't think they should remake it.<br>  And they cannot fit an entire book into a movie.|`|mIEiQcyMaa	No, no and double no!<br>  Maybe the movie isn't true to the book, but the movie is a classic.|`|AA11249599	Yes.

fSYDOxX8aa	Well, it was the 80's and there were a lot of other hair metal bands around. It probably just came down to the fact that they didn't stand out enough. They also had a public argument with their record company, which probably didn't do them any good.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Damned if I know.<br>  <br>  Night Ranger was made of awesome. Jack Blades and Kelly Keaggy were made of awesome. Night Ranger's first two albums were absolute masterpieces. I love Em.|`|uLEpOpSMaa	Compared to some other hair metal bands, Night Ranger actually did pretty well for themselves.  Their first 3 albums all reached platinum status, so that's not too bad!  Their first hit from 1982 was "Don't Tell Me You Love Me", and they also have the hits "When You Close Your Eyes", "You Can Still Rock In America", and "Sentimental Street".  Their second album "Midnight Madness" had 3 hits on it, which is very respectable.<br>  <br>  But you're right, Night Ranger didn't exactly have that lasting stain power like other hair metal bands such as Poision and Motley Crue.  I think it's because Night Ranger made some decent albums in the early 80s, but they didn't continue to evolve their sound enough and produce enough more hits when the mid 80s rolled over.  So consequently, they just kinda faded out and only received nominal success from then on.|`|jNn91TwDaa	I don't know.I love Sister Christian, altough it took me all my life to figure out the artist & song title.I still don't know what he sing in the chorus.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	They only had a few good songs. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Ranger" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Range...</a><br>  They had a new album in 2008.|`|nhk5zzaeaa	I second you on the wondering part....maybe if I knew more songs by them........<br>  <br>  *motorin......*|`|nRqePqZEaa	Hmm, i've wondered, too!

Congrats Freddie!
nhk5zzaeaa	Well, lets see...<br>  <br>  A Day at The Races has:<br>  <br>  Tie Your Mother Down<br>  You Take My Breath Away<br>  Long Away<br>  The Millionare Waltz<br>  You and I<br>  Somebody To Love<br>  White Man<br>  Good Old Fashioned Loverboy<br>  Drowse<br>  and Teo Torriate....<br>  <br>  Tie Your Mother Down,that has one of my favorite riffs and solos ever, and is probably one of my many favorites by them. Long Away, which is great lyrically and never fails to get stuck in my head for days at a time, The Millionare Waltz, *my fine friend, take me with you and love me forever*I love that part... Somebody to love, something so sincere and applicable to mine and everyone's life...those lyrics were straight from Freddie's heart... Good Old Fashioned Loverboy, so tounge in cheek, and one of my faves also, I love singing to that one : ) and Teo Torriate, the japanese blows me away...<br>  <br>  A Night at the Opera has:<br>  <br>  Death On Two Legs<br>  Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon<br>  I'm In Love With My Car<br>  You're My Best Friend<br>  '39<br>  Sweet Lady<br>  Seaside Rendezvous<br>  The Prophet's song<br>  Love Of My Life<br>  Good Company<br>  Bohemian Rhapsody<br>  and God Save The Queen<br>  <br>  My favorites on that album are basically all of them...Death on two legs is the most morbidly hateful and brilliant song I've ever heard of (Freddie at his best), You're My Best Friend is just plain sweet and shows off Deacon's lyrical skills, Brian sounds great on '39, and the whole song is just different and really cool, The Prophet's song is some deep stuff, Love of My Life is just plain beautiful and breathtaking, and written for the luckiest woman in the world, Mary Austin....Good Company has a great message to it, and well, what could I say about Bohemian Rhapsody that hasn't been said already........gosh, that song is completely original, like nothing else. I consider it to be the single greatest song of all time....If I had one wish it would be to know what the meaning is behind those lyrics, although I know Freddie didn't like it when people analyzed them...<br>  <br>  Although I completely love A Day at the Races, I'm going with A Night At the Opera.......everything on that album is an absolute gem, even down to the artwork.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ha ha, sorry I didn't mean to write you an essay, but this was interesting....  : )|`|yS61H04haa	Hmmm.... this is a hard one!! it boils down to two EPIC songs... Teo Torriate or The Prophet's Song. I love them both.<br>  <br>  I am going to have to go with A Night At The Opera. |`|kdo492J7aa	A Night at the Opera |`|R3oNViF8aa	A Night at the Opera. My first Queen album, so it holds a special place in my heart!|`|00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	I like A Day at the Races slightly better.  It covers a wide range of subjects and is definitely underplayed.|`|b56fPzKFaa	of course..... A night at the opera..:)|`|WOMjtldKaa	I love them both!! I'll have to think for this one....<br>  A Night At The Opera wins.|`|nU7yv87Vaa	I prefer A Night at the Opera. It has four of my five favorite Queen songs, and the overall sense I get from listening to it beats the feeling I get from A Day at the Races.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	Personally, A Day at the Races. <br>  <br>  While A Night at the Opera is often considered the better album, and was definitely the more innovative of the two, more of my favourites were on their later album. "You and I" is one of my favourite Deacon composition and "Drowse" is one of my favourites from Taylor. On A Night at the Opera, I wasn't especially fond of "Sweet Lady" and "I'm in Love With My Car", whereas "White Man" is the only song this applied to on A Day at the Races. It's a tough choice though, since both have some excellent songs.
NQ37mnWkaa	I tend to think of both 'heavy' {h} and 'dark' {d} songs together, though most are one without the other, yet convey the same feelings...<br>  <br>  Fleetwood Mac :~<br>  The Green Manalishi (with the Two Pronged Crown) {d&h}<br>  Gold Dust Woman {d}<br>  Sisters of the Moon {single version} {d}<br>  I'm So Afraid {d&h}<br>  <br>  Jethro Tull :~<br>  No Lullaby {d&h}<br>  Dark Ages {d&h}<br>  <br>  Led Zeppelin :~<br>  No Quarter {d}<br>  Communication Breakdown {h}<br>  <br>  Blackmore's Night :~<br>  Gone with the Wind {d}<br>  I Guess it Doesn't Matter Anymore {d&h}<br>  St Teresa {cover} {d}<br>  Mond Tanz / Child In Time {cover} {d&h}<br>  Locked within the Crystal Ball {d}<br>  Fires at Midnight {live 2002} {d}<br>  <br>  Mike Oldfield :~<br>  Tubular Bells {d&h}<br>  Family Man {d}<br>  Shadow on the Wall {h}<br>  <br>  Sandy Denny :~<br>  Nothing More {d}|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Hmmmmmmm.....<br>  <br>  I guess my pick would be the same as your name.  Stone Cold Crazy is pretty heavy musically and is one of Queen's more uptempo, heavier songs.<br>  <br>  I was going to say Death On Two Legs, but I changed my mind, then I started thinking of all of their early work, and changed my mind again.  I just can't decide.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	Queen - "Son and Daughter" heavy musically, "Dead on Time" heavy musically and (kinda) lyrically.<br>  <br>  Iron Maiden - "For the Greater Good of God" <br>  They're generally heavy musically, but they're particularly heavy lyrically on the latest album.|`|7B2s7maWaa	"Thoughts of  A Dying Atheist" and "Hysteria" both by Muse|`|puIX9aKgaa	In terms of music: ''Little Cream Soda''<br>  In terms of lyrics/content: ''I'm Lonely But I Ain't That Lonely Yet'', ''Red Rain'' or ''Truth Doesn't Make a Noise''.<br>  <br>  Oh and the band is The White Stripes.<br>  <br>  Actually, the whole ''Get Behind Me Satan'' album is filled with deep, dark (and a little depressing) songs. Especially when compared to ''De Stijl''.<br>  The song ''As Ugly As I Seem'' always makes me kind of sad.|`|oonb6rXYaa	The most-well known heavy song is probably Dope Nose.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBIuxfRU2o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBIuxfRU...</a><br>  <br>  But I think it's Fall Together from Maladroit.|`|0763bad2e64e093bce37965f69fe43d2aa	"Down In A Hole" Alice In Chains<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL0cK4gaEuM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL0cK4gaE...</a>|`|K4Nt8kZPaa	Probably "The Nile Song" in terms of music...|`|eQtjnKQAaa	Helter Skelter - The Beatles.|`|4DNDAGbXaa	I have too may favorites, but one I'm stuck on <br>  is Foo Fighters     Statues<br>  <br>  |`|wOc4Dqllaa	Definitely "I Want You (She's So Heavy.)"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg8Y-kn4p0" rel="nofollow">http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg8Y-kn4p...</a>|`|MwSaCettaa	<br>  Tear in Heaven/Eric Clapton<br>  <br>  (written for his deceased Son, Conner)<br>  <br>  ???
CxP7YiwFaa	Longevity doesn't ruin a band, fans do. They constantly pressure musicians to do stuff and they're never happy. Fans will complain that a band sold out if they change up a little bit, and they'll claim the bands releasing the same album for the millionth time if they stay the same. Of course, there are bands who sell out and it's obvious that they do because they go from cool to pop after pressure from record companies. |`|PF6yKkVDaa	metallica, ac/dc, rolling stones. not that those bands new music isn't good compared to todays standards of crap music, but all their new stuff fails miserably compared to their old stuff. oh and that guns n' roses we've been waiting ten years for was a big waste of time too.|`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	thank god someone else follows my theory that all bands burn out sometime. <br>  <br>  Rolling Stones<br>  Ac/Dc ( they were only good with Bon Scott in the first place)<br>  Metallica<br>  the Eagles ( I hate comebacks)]<br>  Bon Jovi<br>  Bruce Springsteen<br>  <br>  good back in the day but you've got to let it die sometime |`|FxX8O1BWaa	for u guys hatin on ac/dc i like rock n roll train and i think it goes up against a lot of they're older material, obviosly not thunderstruc, let there be rock, ect. but it is still good.<br>  <br>  metallica should have been gone =p|`|UwxdGCquaa	Metallica<br>  <br>  What does MP: NQ? mean?<br>  <br>  Please help me with my R&P question :)<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhZRI4_DgotKeFhkpNcyYNsXOxh.;_ylv=3?qid=20081029061434AAkRSMG">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|fGpAU0xwaa	Well I think AC/DC made a bad move by signing a contract with Walmart..<br>  <br>  Gah their music was great in the 70's and 80's but I kinda wish they hadn't sold out|`|7vtQnIsTaa	Metallica they should have been gone a long time ago<br>  <br>  EDIT: LOL Rik|`|vyHe3Lfdaa	maybe<br>  <br>  Rolling Stones|`|VZiUJRoDaa	the ones that come to mind are the "oldies tour" groups that'll come to some outdoor festival near you where the band features maybe two original member if youre lucky...hello Three Dog Night and Creedence Clearwater Revisited!!!|`|cXyy2tkSaa	definatly AC/DC<br>  <br>  cant stand their new stuff <br>  <br>  <br>  also the rolling stones|`|u0vjYpJ8aa	no offence to anyone out there but metallica is getting harder and harder to listen to.|`|Es9bRoEtaa	 Yeah, Metallica....... they should have stopped with the black album.

3cfGSkAiaa	I don't like that Ray Manzarek and Robbie Krieger replaced Jim Morrison with Ian Astbury in their new Doors band. It's fine that they want to keep playing their music, but I don't think they should have replaced Jim with Ian. In fact, I don't think they should have replaced him at all. Ray can sing, can't he? And even if he couldn't sing, I'd get someone besides Ian Astbury. I have nothing against him or The Cult, but he looks like a Jim Morrison wannabe when he performs. It's hard to watch. They will never be The Doors without Jim, so they should just stop pretending. <br>  <br>  I can't think of anything wrong with the original Doors though...|`|S8aQrohzaa	One of my favs is The Misfits, but only the era where Danzig was the singer. I actually really don't like anything they put out with any other singer at all.<br>  <br>  oh, another big fav of mine would be Red Hot Chili Peppers, but I guess I don't really like how it sounds like their music is plateauing, and that they take too long between albums.<br>  <br>  Almost everything other band I love is broken up, and that really sucks |`|AA11039335	I don't think ANYONE likes Queen with Paul Rodgers. <br>  <br>  What I don't like about my favourite band - Aside from the fact they are no more, and Jim is DEAD, is the 'Doors Of The 21st Century' with replacement singers. *shudder*<br>  <br>  The Stooges - The fact that they only released three albums in their prime [and one last year], and they all are, far, far, to short. You feel as if the album's over before it's begun. :(|`|7vtQnIsTaa	Well I cant really complain about their music so I will have to go with personal, They Drink Alcohol Like Fishes, and when they do its no fun to hang out with them because they are Obnoxious Drunken IDIOTS!!<br>  <br>  I probably wont hang with them again in the rest of their career which is inconvenient because W.

J18K52Wtaa	I grew up on a farm with about 200 heads, had to milk twice a day by hand .....was real happy when we got a milking machine and automatic pasteurizer. Modern machinery is wonderful!!!!|`|vvzhSb6Xaa	No, but I watched one being milked at school once when they had this whole week theme of milk. They put a processor thing on her udders and told us about it.

ZzqWzFNiaa	No way, me too. My wife and I just went through the motions. We're in escrow right now, offer is in and accepted and the loan officer says approval is just a formality from here (I'll feel better when I see that "approved" stamp though). At any rate, it's incredibly exciting. It's actually become really frustrating that we are far too aware that we can't move in until at least 12/15. I'm looking forward to working on making the garage a decent rock space. My wife also said that I can set up the second bedroom as a little personal recording space. I can't wait to buy her some drums.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Congrats!

NQ3XZElFaa	I am depressed that Metro Station has ever been associated with techno.<br>  Using synthesizers does not make a band techno.<br>  Duran Duran was not techno. Metro Station is not techno.<br>  They're synth-pop.<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question, there seems to be a  second wave of synth-pop. It was popular in the 80's and it seems to be popular again. There isn't really any explanation, it's just the way music works. We had grunge in the 90's and I wouldn't be surprised if there was a second wave in the next decade or so.<br>  <br>  A Kind of Magic: Did you just use the drummer from Duran Duran as an example? Duran Duran? Anyone who acts like Duran Duran was anything special has no right to criticize modern music.<br>  How does lack of talent explain synthesizers? The Ramones had no real talent but they played raw, punk rock sans synthesizers. Talking Heads had a lot of talent and they used synthesizers. No correlation between talent and synthesizers.|`|CxP7YiwFaa	This is just a guess here, but I'm thinking it has something to do with the way European metal bands like Lordi put bits of Eurodance in their songs. It's not a band thing, but when it becomes a fad, it kind of loses it's originality and spark.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	i don't concider them rock...rock music isn't mear techno..bands like Metro Station are bands that are just trying to fit in with what's in right now even though what's in sounds really lame.|`|Lg7Kgo24aa	because thats what sells to scene kids.|`|oCUcwVPiaa	I've been wondering the same thing myself, but I believe its because that's the direction music and society is going in.

I supported McCain because I am pro gun and I think he has a better policy on National Security.  I don't care how many promises they both made about the economy, those bills still have to get through Congress, and they have already proved worthless in this past decade.<br>  <br>  Not all voters did it for the wrong reasons, but the ones that put Obama over the top did, IMO.

Why? They tend to have less odor to them, they're more convenient (whether taking them in the car or having them up on the couch), they're cuter (smaller dogs are more cute while big dogs are cute in a more masculine sort of way), they eat less and use smaller things (which is good on the budget) and that's all I can think of right now. This is all just personal opinion and preference, I've seen some gorgeous big dogs and to some people cost and convenience don't matter, they just like big dogs! which is tooootally cool.|`|EvbqViIQaa	Good things about big dogs - Sweet to hug; good watch dogs;<br>  <br>  Bad things about big dogs - Hard to handle, (as in walking,) cost more money to feed; can sometimes jump on you and hurt you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good things about small dogs - Can sit on your lap; Don't take up much room; don't eat as much; can't really hurt you by jumping on you.<br>  <br>  Bad things about small dogs - Many are picky so they may not eat certain things; they like to be around you a lot, (this may be good or bad. You could be a person who loves to care for them and always be around them, or you could not have time for them sometimes, so it may get annoying,)|`|Mm3VhbUkaa	I like smaller dogs because they are easier to have in smaller places (like apartments or condominiums), and are easier to take care of. They need less food and water to keep them healthy, rather than giving a lot of food to larger dogs as well as more water. Smaller dogs are less of a hassle and easier to work with that big dogs most of the time due to their size.|`|pRpgbuqiaa	I once lived with a Bichon Frise, which is a small dog. It had a very lively temperament, yet he would "know" when to be a quiet dog. A small dog doesn't eat half as much as a big dog, so the cost of his food was less. He was a dog that could walk on any kind of furniture and not make a mess. He was a dog that didn't shed, he got haircuts. This particular breed of dog is on the expensive side of the spectrum. As a small dog, he was easily housetrained (with newspapers.) His bark wasn't very loud. He was so small he could sleep in mum's bed without taking up half of it. He was a brave and adventurous dog who would play in the snow or rain just for the fun of it. He was an appreciative dog who would show a childlike happiness when he got a treat. When it was Christmastime and the house was full, no one was happier than the Bichon Frise of ours.|`|hS2WxaxMaa	I love big dogs....  everytime I see I giant dog like a Great Dane, Mastiff or Rottweiler, I say "now that's a dog".     Growing up we had 2 dogs.. a Doberman and a German Shepard... so I think bigger dogs were what I always knew and liked. To me, little always equated to yippy little creatures that seemed annoying.<br>  <br>  But I have a small house... so can't have a big dog.. so as much as I love a big dog, I own a small one (Pomeranian) that I love to death...  and he's not even the least biy yippy.  :)|`|jqAG9Ywxaa	BIG DOGS<br>   <br>  Nobody wants some little prissy dog that looks all awkward and ****. We want a big lovable dog that you can actually play with, without breaking one of its bones.<br>  things that make peaople mad about small dogs:<br>  #1: High pitched bark - Who wants to listen to that all day? The sad thing is that many of these small dogs think they are tough so of course they bark every chance they get. Sometimes I use them to tune the high F# key on my piano. Besides that, it is worthless.<br>  <br>  #2: Lack of intelligence: I’m not going to generalize all small dogs. But, from what i’ve seen, I can say with a great degree of confidence that many small breeds of dog have an even smaller brain. E.G. My friend’s dog constantly runs into his glass door. The dog has been doing this for years. YEARS! I do have to say it’s kind of funny, so maybe this technically isn’t a fault.<br>  <br>  #3: Like to get stepped on: Being both small and stupid is not the best combination. Dogs of this size must enjoy getting trampled because they always wait for me to come through the door and strategically place themselves under my feet. If you want to avoid costly vet bills because Fido has the Nike logo engraved in his head, don’t get a small dog.<br>  <br>  #4: Annoying bite: Now no one really wants to get bitten by a dog. But the purpose of a bite is to inflict pain. God forbid anyone would ever try to kidnap your dog, you would hope your dog would be able to deter it in some shape or form. A bite from a small dog sort of feels similar to accupuncture. You get scared at first but then realize it isn’t so bad. This is not a good trait to have.. unless of course your dog bites you all the time.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, small dogs piss me off. |`|W9N426Jqaa	I love big dogs i hate little dogs and heres why.

Plus, they make good snugglers come bed time :)|`|4aca01575221ad287a6cc55371d82a3aaa	I prefer little dogs as they tend to live longer and make better lap dogs.

Everyone has their different obsessions.|`|OI29tkSoaa	They are just excited to watch the movie when it comes out |`|zn3NC3ezaa	Because they're in love with a fictional character named Edward Cullen.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Hehe.<br>  <br>  I absolutely adored it, I really did. <br>  <br>  All books are unoriginal now-a-days. Everything derives directly from Shakespeare. Nothing is new or surprising anymore. <br>  <br>  I own all four books, and I personally think its a good read. I have a predisposition to vampric nature, I've always preferred to read things about it because I love everyone's separate take on the look and actions of it.<br>  <br>  Plus I loved the portrayal of Edward. Its nice to read a good romance when you've got free time alone. <br>  <br>  I'm not OBSESSED, but I do enjoy reading the books. But its not the BEST SERIES EVER OMG! <br>  <br>  I'm a bigger fan of Dean Koontz.<br>  <br>  :)|`|qS2lYAiLaa	i dont know. i liked that book. it was good. but i didnt read it all day everyday just like everybody else. some of my friends are so obsessed with it that they actually bought a twilight shirt and wore it to school. xP|`|7d5ec5e53039b237fbb5c9d8ffa0e9f3aa	I like Twilight but I don't get it either.

It sucks...|`|hfBIBB1Maa	At first i thought the same thing [the "why are all people reading this book?"] but yesterday i started reading the book<br>  and OMG it's freaking awesome!<br>  it's really good even thought it's unrealistic, it really captures you.<br>  If you haven't read it yet you should just give it a try remember don't judge a book by it's cover [in this cause summary]<br>  But some people really get weird with the whole "I love Edward" and the  "I'm Edward's girlfriend" kinda weirdd|`|zhzJoZ26aa	I never liked the series, I read them all and I can name 100 better books, they weren't that bad but yeah. I'm not obsessed with the books but I am obsessed with the movie coming out, for the reason I love Robert Pattinson (Edward in the movie) I fell in love with him in Harry Potter as Cedric, and every movie of his from then was a must see. |`|b24a186d94cd66e3909fc8c200a56ebbaa	Argh this question has been asked so many times, but I still like to answer it for some reason. Well its the fact that theres Edward Cullen which many girls adore. There are many girls who have always thought about having the "Perfect" Boyfriend. And after reading Twilight thats where they saw that one perfect guy. Which is Edward Cullen. They love to read the story wondering what he will do next. Thats how I see it. I liked the books but Im not CRAZY over the book and like drooling over Edward like these fangirls are...geeze it gets annoying...|`|tRE05DNTaa	its just a really good book that is like every girls fantasy. <br>  <br>  Most girls wish they could have there own Edward.<br>  <br>  I personaly LOVE  the books!|`|AtM1l8Bwaa	its about vampires.. of course its unrealistic<br>  <br>  though I read The first one (Twilight) and i liked it|`|EOYVileUaa	I have NO idea.<br>  <br>  I hated it. It was stupid IMO.<br>  <br>  <br>  I stopped after the first book...actually, I didn't even finish it.|`|e61b6f14e6d908535f36e113ec589f3caa	I have no idea|`|dlvtCzSTaa	What's that?|`|Qh7ILfVeaa	The reason why people love it so much is because of the love between Edward and Bella (Edwards the vampire and Bella is the normal human). Stephanie Meyer does a great job and showing how much they love each other. The second book, New Moon, really shows it. I'm personally a big fan of Twilight!   |`|v3fL81Bjaa	Never read it, never will. You want a good series of vampire novels, go read Anne Rice's series, such as The Vampire LeStat.

rMq9D06Faa	More often than I should!<br>  <br>  The one that comes to mind is last summer when my family had a reunion at the beach/campground.  My dad, mom and I took a spontaneous walk down to the water and there were big waves!  We were fully dressed, and the water was cold, so with every wave we tried to only get wet up to a certain point.  My mom is shorter than my dad and I so she would get wetter than us.  One wave almost sucked her in.  It was awesome because that kind of sponaneous family fun is something we haven't had in a LOOOONG time!<br>  <br>  Toward the end, though, I began to realize that will probably be the last time we go to the beach together and a moment that can never be matched!  It made me sad to think that during this great time, that before long I will lose my parents for good!|`|b86b601e857ab3f32e2405d77431eaccaa	"there is no pain so great, as the memory of joy in present sadness."|`|hG48Lhnzaa	Yes, some moments are bittersweet.|`|1CSFFKxYaa	Sometimes, <br>  but only if I really look for it.|`|n4488JyCaa	sometimes|`|DDnxY3k1aa	depending.|`|fWclxi9Baa	never |`|a5g60zfxaa	no|`|cJYAhLFCaa	yes!  i totally know what you mean.  it's bittersweet.  it's like it's so happy, but you know it'll be over in a certain amount of time, so it's also sad.  haha.|`|VxE46bSFaa	Yes, because I feel sad that the certain happy moment is over.

Depends on what they are.  For example.... this upcoming Christmas, I will be very happy because my bf and I have really good jobs and will be able to afford to have a really nice christmas.... Plus! We are both going to be having Christmas parties with work etc.  However we both live accross the country from all of our family, so it will also be a very sad and lonely Christmas.  <br>  Also there are times where you feel sad when someone passes, however if someone passes and they've been suffering there is happiness for their moving forward :)<br>  When I drink and take part in "extra curricular activities"  I'm temporarily happy, but also sad that I can't be strong enough to feel that happiness without the extras.<br>  I also find when I'm super excited about something, and that day arrives, I tend to have been so overwhelmed with excitement before the event, that I'm almost sad that moment has come because it wasn't nearly as exciting living through the event as the build up was prior to the event! <br>  What do you think?|`|rJLeVoMKaa	Definitely.  <br>  <br>  I always try to keep in mind that happy=happens and there is a greater joy I seek.|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	I can find sadness anywhere ... or it finds me.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	no, but i found some cookies in the cookie jar

fwyofOebaa	It better<br>  I already feel like we're screwed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think US is being kinda ridiculous though. People on TV were saying ''I've wanted a black president since I was a little girll.." they OBVIOUSLY wanted him in office because of that. Also, McCain had WAY more experience- he can't even lift up his arms because he was tourtured and a prisoner of war for 5 years because HE WOULDN'T LEAVE HIS PEOPLE. He knew so much and could do so much- but at the same time, I think a lot of the people just wanted Obama because he's a minority, like all the people I know that are black wanted him to win for no other reason than that. I'm not saying that for everyone- Blacks wanted McCain to win as well, just I so far haven't met one African American that wanted him for any other reason. I feel this election was more about race, and don't thumbs down me for saying my opinion.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	I know he will and i think its sad that people still care about skin color instaed of what a person can really do and is willing to do..we need to look past all of that...he will do well...but it'll take him a good while to clean up alll the mess that was left before him...Good luck and God's richest blessings to Obama!! =)<br>  <br>  Obama '08 Ya'll !!! =)|`|jF1xH89Caa	I hope so!

I doubt that thought even occurs to Obama.  We are in a global recession that can only get worse for the next couple of years.  There will continue for much longer the threat of war.  Historically, the Democrats have guided us out of our most serious financial crises.  The election may be seen as a mandate for drastic action and another New Deal could develop out of this.  And Obama could go down in history as the next most beloved President after FDR.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Yes, but not where we want to be.  Socialism has never worked in any country in which it's practiced.  The definition of stupidity is to continue making the same mistake over and over again, hoping for a different result.  That's what we've got on our hands now.  He's an inexperienced politician who has never run anything before, so it's difficult to say what he'll do in these next four years.  He truly was the "green" candidate!|`|iJXFZx7taa	You never know, might even be 8!<br>  <br>  But I think he WILL have a tough time, simply because of the expectations people have for him, and also the fact that it's inevitable that someone will attempt to assassinate him.|`|3b2a23def10204c05ae687cb086abe96aa	In all honesty, without being hateful, or really trying to attack him; I REALLY believe that he is just a charismatic speaker.

0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	It was what was called a "Maxi-Series". They have since been collected into a graphic novel.<br>  <br>  More than likely that's how you'll find it for sale in comic book shops and bookstores. It might even be the only way you'll find it, unless you happen to live near a comic book store that sells collected sets of comic series.<br>  <br>  However, in certain instances, (i.e. The Sandman, Fables,) a graphic novel is the best way to read a series that might be a little confusing.<br>  <br>  One bit of advice, the heroes in Watchmen are based on the old Charlton Comics heroes, Owlman/Blue Beetle, The Comedian/Peacemaker, Rorschach/The Question, Silk Spectre/Nightshade, Dr. Manhattan/Captain Atom, so while the Charlton Heroes were picked up by DC Comics, you might not be familiar with them.

I really have to say no.<br>  <br>  It is not addictive. Anybody who says it is probably also believe Columbus discovered America.<br>  <br>  It's true, nobody has ever died from an overdose.<br>  <br>  BUT:<br>  <br>  Marijuana is a depressant, much like alcohol it numb's the body. In order to emulate that euphoric sense, it minimizes oxygen transfer to the brain. And what happens when the brain is robbed of oxygen??? You start killing brain cells.<br>  <br>  While it is true nobody has ever died from too much pot... It is also true that anybody who was a consistent user of marijuana has EVER achieved anything significant in their lifetime. It WILL create a society of underachievers.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that POT makes people lazy... YES IT DOES (For those who are sitting in their parents house cruising YA right now saying "No it doesn't").<br>  <br>  I do have friends that still smoke, and are productive citizens... But we are not talking about the functional minority. We are talking about the dysfuntional majority that will start popping up as our society plummets into obscurity.<br>  <br>  As for me... Why did I stop??? 15 years ago, I found out I was going to be a Dad and decided that I would need to teach my son how to be a man, not only by my words but by my actions and lifestyle too.|`|Jtp4CUppaa	no|`|ukTR7KNSaa	Yes.  It's not as evil as people want us to think.  It's never killed anyone and does not make one violent.  I'm a drinker, but alcohol is much more of a killer drug.  Cigarettes, too.  Why should those drugs be legal, but not pot?  Besides, it's a natural plant.  There are more uses for it than smoking it as well.  Let it grow.|`|8698ad788d29eb3bfd4384d7ea145f3faa	NEVER -- know people who died from its use .. know what it does to people .. and I certainly do NOT want my LIFE ENDANGERED on the Job or anywhere else by someone under the Influence (that can't respond appropriately or do the job or even care).|`|WOHha0sfaa	Hell NO...<br>  you need a reason??? seriously???<br>  cuz its a drug, unhealthy... cannabis smoke contained more toxic substances than tobacco smoke...|`|270c6c1779a03eafb25d7751b21ab80aaa	Yes, hemp is known to create stronger clothes that last much longer and would bring clothing prices down because of competition.  <br>  <br>  But the cotton industry lobbies to keep it illegal.|`|wnCQPYRmaa	YES!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Because Marijuana is good.....Nay, It's GREAT!!!|`|zemJlYljaa	No.......its a gateway drug most people who try weed are willing to try other harder drugs..........and i have seen this happen many times.|`|3EwI2nGzaa	"Marijuana users are determined to stand up to the injustice of marijuana probation and accomplish legalization, no matter how long or what it takes to succeed. Despite the threat of arrests and a variety of other punishments and sanctions marijuana users have persisted in their support for legalization for over a generation. They refuse to give up their long quest for justice because they believe in the fundamental values of American society. Prohibition has failed to silence marijuana users despite its best attempts over the last generation. The issue of marijuana's legalization is a persistent issue that, like marijuana, will simply not go away. Marijuana will be legalized because marijuana users will continue to fight for it until they succeed."|`|rJddcoaOaa	Yes. As Amsterdamn has shown, legalizing marijuana doesn't create a city of zombies. Legalizing it actually takes away the rebelious aspect of it and most people try it then move on.<br>  And the common line that it leads to harsher drugs is a furfie, it actually leads to harsher people (becuse of the criminal element involved), it's up the the individual whether they want to slip further down the drug chain from there.<br>  Plus it would be cheaper. <br>  More problems from alchohol than marijuana, i'd rather walk into a room of people i dont know who were stoned, than a room of strange drunks.<br>  As they say, god created marijuana, man created alcholhol-who do you trust|`|t2LZIUClaa	No<br>  <br>  It distorts the Mind. <br>  <br>  People get bored with this high want to move on to a bigger one.|`|e24YDIdBaa	you know y its not legall? b.c if it was legall everyone would be planting it in their house and the gov wouldnt be able to make money off of it <br>  TRUE STORY|`|AA10778928	no<br>  because..no...just no|`|7b0ZN5Xwaa	yep it should be and then they should tax the sh*t out of alcohol<br>  because if someone is stoned, they will sit through the light possibly two times and if someone is drunk they will run the red light and possibly hit another car.<br>  the only reason they dont make pot legal is because they cant tax it.  think about how many people have died from alcohol, have been in an accident due to drunk driving or have died because of alcohol... <br>  now think of how many people died because of pot....<br>  and i do drink alcohol <br>  thanks (:|`|eQjkP4oMaa	im high right now|`|Fmhsy8CKaa	Hell yeah! Not only for its medicinal reasons, but it can be turned into fuel for our cars, paper, clothes and ink for pens. It has a million uses and you won't get robbed at gun point because someone is coming down and needs another fix. <br>  <br>  <br>  Weed is not the gate-way drug. That is BS. Alcohol is. I have done way more things while drunk or drinking than I ever had while I was smoking a blunt. I had never tried meth because I smoked a joint, I have snorted a line because I was drinking and figured what the hey.

Currently they are working on a synthetic form that will deliver the benefits without making the patients "high".<br>  <br>  BUT there should be stricter guidelines in order to receive a prescription.  There is far too much abuse in the system, which does a disservice to the legitimate patients. <br>  <br>  Oh, and no I don't use the stuff.|`|aZdxADBAaa	no because it harms the body|`|8P5DZPmHaa	Do I think marijuana should be legalized!?!<br>  WHY NOT?<br>  <br>  1) Because it's a plant and it grows out of the Earth<br>  2) It is a good medicine<br>  3) It doesn't kill anyone<br>  4) Obama smokes it<br>  5) It makes STAR WARS way cooler<br>  6) Opens your mind<br>  7) Makes you want to fornicate.....reproduction is gooooooood for humanity<br>  8) Promotes peace, I mean you're more likely to find a stoner eating a Popsicle than trying to kill someone.<br>  9) soaps, rope, paper, lotions, wax. Cannabis in general has a tremendous number of applicable properties<br>  10) It makes alot of people feel good! Is that such a bad thing?<br>  11) It's taxable!!! If marijuana were integrated into the economy, it would be a BIG TIME CASH CROP!|`|jX0rNoM4aa	we had a session last month!<br>  <br>  it should be legalized!! hahah!<br>  <br>  <br>  Cannabis, also known as marijuana[1] or marihuana, or mariguana,[2] or ganja (from Hindi/Sanskrit: ????? gānjā, hemp),[3] is a psychoactive product of the plant Cannabis sativa, or more often, Cannabis sativa subsp. indica. The herbal form of the drug consists of dried mature flowers and subtending leaves of pistillate (female) plants. The resinous form, known as hashish,[4] consists primarily of glandular trichomes collected from the same plant material. The major biologically active chemical compound in cannabis is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), commonly referred to as THC.<br>  <br>  Humans have been consuming cannabis since prehistory,[5] although in the 20th century there was a rise in its use for recreational, religious or spiritual, and medicinal purposes. It is estimated that about four percent[6] of the world's adult population use cannabis annually and 0.6 percent daily. The possession, use, or sale of psychoactive cannabis products became illegal in most parts of the world in the early 20th century. Since then, some countries have intensified the enforcement of cannabis prohibition while others have reduced the priority of enforcement.<br>  <br>  <br>  A synthetic form of one chemical in marijuana, Δ(delta)-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is a controversial treatment for medical use. The American Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-cannabis organization, claims that cannabis is an ideal therapeutic drug for cancer and AIDS patients, who often suffer from clinical depression, and from nausea and resulting weight loss due to chemotherapy and other aggressive treatments.[27] Other medical uses may included fighting cancer, according to an isolated study by scientists in Italy. This study states that cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in marijuana, inhibits growth of cancer cells in animals.[28]<br>  <br>  The FDA and comparable authorities in Western Europe, including the Netherlands, have not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease. The current view of the United States Food and Drug Administration is that if there is any future of marijuana as a medicine, it lies in its isolated components, the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives.[29]<br>  <br>  A synthetic version of the cannabinoid THC named dronabinol has been shown to relieve symptoms of anorexia and reduce agitation in elderly Alzheimer's patients.[30] Dronabinol has been approved for use with anorexia in patients with HIV/AIDS and chemotherapy-related nausea. This drug, while demonstrating the effectiveness of cannabis at combating several disorders, is more expensive and less available than "pot" and has not been shown to be effective or safe.[31]<br>  <br>  Glaucoma, a condition of increased pressure within the eyeball causing gradual loss of sight, can be treated with medical marijuana to decrease this intraocular pressure. There has been debate for 25 years on the subject. Some data exist, showing a reduction of IOP in glaucoma patients who smoke marijuana,[32] but the effects are short-lived, and the frequency of doses needed to sustain a decreased IOP can cause systemic toxicity. There is also some concern over its use since it can also decrease blood flow to the optic nerve. Marijuana lowers IOP by acting on a cannabinoid receptor on the ciliary body called the CB receptor.[33] Although marijuana is not a good therapeutic choice for glaucoma patients, it may lead researchers to more effective, safer treatments. A promising study shows that agents targeted to ocular CB receptors can reduce IOP in glaucoma patients who have failed other therapies.[34]<br>  <br>  Medical marijuana is used for analgesia, or pain relief. “Marijuana is used for analgesia only in the context of a handful of illnesses (e.g., headache, dysentery, menstrual cramps, and depression) that are often cited by marijuana advocates as medical reasons to justify the drug being available as a prescription medication.”[35] It is also reported to be beneficial for treating certain neurological illnesses such as epilepsy, and bipolar disorder.[36] Case reports have found that cannabis can relieve tics in people with obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome. Patients treated with tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive chemical found in cannabis, reported a significant decrease in both motor and vocal tics, some of 50% or more.[37][38][39] Some decrease in obsessive-compulsive behavior was also found.[37] A recent study has also concluded that cannabinoids found in cannabis might have the ability to prevent Alzheimer's disease.[40] THC has been shown to reduce arterial blockages.[41]<br>  <br>  Another use for medical marijuana is movement disorders. Marijuana is frequently reported to reduce the muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis; this has been acknowledged by the Institute of Medicine, but it noted that these abundant anecdotal reports are not well-supported by clinical data. Evidence from an|`|IM645vQtaa	This may sound weird, but i'm a Christian, and I say that marijuana should be legalized.  I'm not a user, being that i have asthma, i can't smoke anything as it would do me great harm, and i'm not into the stupid generation of reefers.  BUT, it should be legalized for many reasons, actually all drugs should be legalized.  I'm going to get many haters on this, but facts are facts, and in my college classes i had to do research on this and it forced me to change my views.  Most gang wars are fought for the control of territory, and it's all based on their drug trade.  The same thing happened with prohibition and the prohibition of guns.  Gangs, mobsters found a way to make money off of it and kill many people.  If drugs, all drugs were legalized, we would eradicate this problem.  But then people would say that the users would die of overdoses and overuse...etc....well, it could happen, but probably not more than what it is now.  If drugs were legalized, there would be companies producing those drugs, which means we wouldn't get dirty drugs on the street that people WILL buy and they will get sick or die from it.  Also, in the year 2000, the USA spent $40 Billion on their war against drugs, and let me tell you, that money is being spent foolishly, because that war is being lost miserably.  Some European countries, when they legalized marijuana and drugs, they didn't see ANY change in the amount of usage.  Weird huh.  Also, it's cheaper to medically treat a drug addict than it is so far to fight our war on drugs.  By legalizing all drugs, we get less government spending, more money into the economy by this new business.  We put drug dealers and mob countries out of business, saving innocent lives, and treating people that want to be treated with them not being afraid that they are addicts to an illegal drug..does this all make sense? I hope so! You can be the change for new legislative action, we all have to speak up to have our voices heard, i'm speaking up and you can too!  Let's get our great country to prosper, not be pushed into the mud!<br>  |`|5XqV6FzZaa	Yes. Those who don't want it, won't use it anyway. Those who want it, will find it anywhere. At the same time some people think: "Aha! It is forbidden! So, I need to try it to know why". That's a corrupting way of thinking, and it is inherent in many people's minds. So, when it is legalized, people just may lose interest to it.|`|g6BmGlXOaa	yes please !!|`|FQuw7taPaa	yes SMOKING IS|`|LBUxS7BOaa	Actually it should be allowed to be sold in small quantities.  Otherwise illegal.  It should be easy to get since people will get it anyways.  Also it gives them a place where they can get canabis.

ryLbKatoaa	1. I didn't like One Piece, so I'm slightly biased there...<br>  <br>  2. I only watched the first season of Bleach and friends who watched further tell me that the first season is the only one that's really good, so I'd say stop.<br>  <br>  3. Fillers do suck. And from what I've heard, Shippuden saved Naruto, so just skip the rest of the series and watch that. <br>  <br>  4. Yes, there's a point. You learn about a new culture and there are some really amazing stories out there. But I suggest that you watch some shorter anime. Then you won't need to skip episodes and there's less filler. Shorter anime also have less time to deteriorate, therefore concluding successfully before it turns to crap.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	1. If you don't like the fights, I suggest that you stop watching One Piece. The series has tons of fights like that of Luffy and Don Krieg. There are more fighting scenes in this series.<br>  <br>  2. You should continue Bleach.<br>  <br>  3. You should read the manga, Naruto because there are no fillers in the manga<br>  <br>  4. I do because I have nothing to do at home, and its really worth my time.|`|7Sflq2doaa	1) Don't know muck about One Piece, but if you like keep watching<br>  2) oh god yes, keep watching, the current arc on [AS] isn't as good but it just gets better, I've been watching the subbed and they recently finished another filler arc that I say was better than the first.<br>  3) I don't follow Naruto but I'm starting to like it, maybe y ou should switch to subbed<br>  4) you don't have to spend most of your time watching anime but if you're bored and have time to kill you may as well not be bored and watch some anime. I am desperately trying to get a DVR now. |`|JhUHxlf0aa	One Piece is much better then Bleach and Naruto in my opinion, One Piece gets a wayyyy better drawing style in later episodes, and has more feeling and action and bloodshed.|`|ZxJ4SL90aa	1) not sure honestly i used to watch one piece but i swung out it after a while<br>  2) yes continue bleach<br>  3) ye we all hate fillers yes subbed is better :) yes continue<br>  3) lol my life is anime :P<br>  |`|1ARZEto1aa	No to 1, 2, and 3 and yes to 4. <br>  <br>  There are actually GOOD animes worth watching. |`|3fVsb4NNaa	Yes<br>  Yes<br>  Just do it. The fillers mean nothing to the story.<br>  I do. If you like it and it works for you.|`|0STz8nBvaa	1. I have seen a few episodes of One Piece. Personally I couldn't get into it, but there are many fights in that anime. Hmmm, well if you enjoy it so far then continue it! ^_^ You might enjoy the rest as well and if not then discontinue it. <br>  <br>  2. O_O I am so behind on Bleach, but I heard it is a really good anime and from the episodes I did manage to watch it is good. ^_^ <br>  <br>  3. There are a lot of fillers in Naruto. OoO Hmm...I am currently reading the manga which is better in my opinion. ^_^ I haven't seen Shippudden yet, but I heard from others that it is cool. And I know some who continued to watch Naruto even though they didn't care for the fillers...I guess fillers can really take away from the anime series, but hey if you're truly dedicated to it then continue. ^_^<br>  <br>  4. ^^ Well recently I haven't watch much because I am so busy. O_O But I try to watch some anime here and there like today I watched the first episode of Basilisk. XD Someone recommended it to me. Animes are very interesting and fun to get into if you find the right one to fit your preferences. =) Should be something you enjoy watching. Can be inspiring as well in a way...with the stories and characters and art. ^_^

Xqr8JsdFaa	This will be a great experience for you.  I still remember my first concert like it was yesterday.  It was Iron Maiden back in the late 80's for their Somewhere In Time release.  I now work in the concert industry and love everything about the concert experience.  <br>  Just take it all in.  The buzz in the crowd when they kill the houselights, the cheers when the first sound of the band is heard, when they finally bring up the stage lights and the crowd sees the band for the first time.  It's such an electrifying part of the show.<br>  The show you are going to is heavy with pyro, so there will be so much for you to take in and enjoy.  It's almost as much fun to watch the crowd as the band.  Don't be too self concious and just do what feels good...sing at the top of your lungs, jump around, have a blast.  <br>  <br>  You only get one "first concert" and you have picked a great one to go to.  HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	HAVE FUN!! is the only advice I have for you.<br>  <br>  AC/DC is gonna be a rowdy concert, so just watch yourself, and don't jump into anything crazy.  Stick with your brother, and enjoy the show.<br>  <br>  You are very lucky to be going to such a good show for your first concert.|`|AA11102015	Should be a good show. What you may want to do to save your hearing a little is either get some earplugs, or roll up a little bit of napkin from whatever the venue is and stick it in your ear. You'll still be able to hear the band clearly and afterwards your hearing will be fine.<br>  <br>  Saw AC/DC in Madison Square Garden and in the Meadowlands. Kick a$$ shows!|`|oCUcwVPiaa	Just focus on really getting into the music, and have a good time. Just aviod those concert goers that tend to have a bit to much to drink and get out of hand, they can be nasty.|`|Cpsqgw3haa	Keep your horns up \m/<br>  Don't stop headbanging until the concert is over|`|GtJiXYDvaa	just stick with ur bro and don't get lost :P

ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Kurt Cobain was a great frontman with or without his guitar!  Some of his best performances were without the guitar(thinking of the Unplugged performance here), but he was great anyway!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Yea, probably.  He wasn't a very good guitar player anyway, so he should have just been a frontman.|`|LZk1lM7Naa	I LOVE that performance of Drain You. The whole song and the vibe you get from Kurt is great. And everybody loves the scream in it also. <br>  <br>  Yes, he would have been a great singer.|`|dIa1EqM2aa	he was a wonderful lyricist and captivated his fans<br>  <br>  he was a great guitar player but i suppose he could have just sung but i like that he did both<br>  <br>  he was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  |`|rJddcoaOaa	Yes, but i think it gave him something to hide behind.

VxE46bSFaa	You should probably tell her. Most people that I know that sleep talk don't say true things. They tend to just babble on in their sleep about things that don't make any sense. What she said might not have been true. If I accidentally said something personal in my sleep I would want to be told what I had said, so I would at least know what I had said. |`|ubk21UBvaa	well depends how close you are with her. and what its about<br>  example: if your really close friends and its something about her and a guy or something, you can tell her. but if its really really bad, let it pass and if you need to, tell her later. when everything has passes.<br>  <br>  of you told us the general idea of what she said the answers would be better|`|87yovKYlaa	i would tell her you heard her talking in her sleep and that you don't know who else might of heard her. that way she can do damage control with the others by asking them if they heard her talking in her sleep and if so what did they hear.|`|lg6jexk7aa	I had a friend that used to do that - we ended up telling her so that she could be more aware of her actions during her sleep.

I'm sorry, but who really needs their kitchen knives to cut through drywall anyway?|`|n11TSqkbaa	I want to hang with Vincy. I be that guy has some sweet people around him.

kTc3bfrRaa	they  COUNT themselves   crazy!!!|`|xXhkRq0Caa	I don't think people that are truly rich are jerks. It's the people that think they have money that are jerks.

It hard keeping up the facade and perpetrating a fraud.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Bc ppl suck up to them and they get arrogant about it.

They do not know how to adjust their lives - and they make fools of themselves as a result.<br>  <br>  The most common fault I see is in the number of jumped up wealthy men who continue working, or attempting to.  This is just vulgar greed. Examples are people like Rupert Murdoch,  footballers, politicians and senior police officers.  A number of popular musicians whose talent peaked 20 years ago.  Television presenters.  Televangelists. <br>  <br>  We all know the sort.<br>  <br>  When I inherited my considerable fortune, I certainly saw no need to make a public nuisance of myself in that way.   I hadn't worked much before, and I saw no need to draw attention to myself by pretending to do so afterwards.   They should close down all the charities too, they encourage all sorts of nonsense.  Bono and people.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	3.4 Trillion did it for me.<br>  My whole body is jerking.|`|0muvYszmaa	Because the people they are around aren't as "good" in their opinion cause you don't have a lot of money.

But math makes more sense then maths.|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Because they altered the English language|`|kHY0eMVraa	Who calls it Maths?<br>  Math is normal to us.|`|o9UquyzLaa	Why would you call it maths?

"Math" is already short for "mathematics", so by saying "maths", you would basically be saying "mathematicss". Math is also an irregular plural, like deer. Do you say deers? No. It's just one of the irregularities of the English language. Yes, they are using the correct terms. <br>   <br>  In America, if you say it as "maths", someone will probably give you a funny look, like you just said something really dumb; as it is considered here a very bad grammar mistake. I didn't know anyone said "maths". Hmm, that is interesting... <br>  <br>  ---Ash---|`|1QU88lbHaa	Jeez people are defensive, it's a fair enough question, just relax.<br>  Here in Australia we call it maths too, for us math sounds like it can't be a stand alone word in a way so we add s to make it sound like it has owning, or not just an adjective before class or something.<br>  Its just different word customs, like how americans say trunk of the car & we say boot of the car. It all makes sense anyway.|`|AA11593134	I believe since Mathematics is singular and so should be Math for short. You don't say Profs for Professor, right? I've been to few other countries and I think most countries say Math just like we do... So I think it is just in England?<br>  (I know our English originated from England, I believe, but I think this one, we got it right...)<br>  : )|`|AA12004569	Math in school? The only math I ever heard of was that awful headache inducing crap that I have avoided with all my might ever since getting into college.

Different countries just adopt different ways of pronouncing things. It's not worth getting wound up about is it? You could say that about many different things that the Americans say differently from us. They are a different country and adopt different ideas.<br>  <br>  We should all except each other for our different ways. It'd be a funny and boring world if we were all the same.|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	They've developed their own version of the English language. Same reason they spell things differently, like "color" and "colour". And this isn't an ignorant question, it's simple curiosity. The person who said it was should remove the massive chip from their shoulder, the girl is only asking!|`|AA10711210	I don't know. I suppose we say maths because it is short for mathematics.<br>  Math must be short for mathematic, which doesn't make sense to me; but then I always found aspects of the USA mysterious.<br>  <br>  And after a quick run through, I can't be the only one who knows that the full term is "mathematics". 43?|`|1MCSFA86aa	i agree why do you call it maths?<br>  <br>  math sounds better.<br>  <br>  btw, in the states there are different tyes of math like algelbra or precalc. it depends on which course your taking at the time.<br>  and we usually say that instead of math.<br>  <br>  aleast in my school because there is like 20 different math courses<br>  <br>  oh well. everyone is different|`|JOkuaUDvaa	i dunno - there are differnces in english and american - like colour (english) color (american)<br>  or in england there are two types of the word practise/practice - one is a noun and one is a verb :S in ameircan [less confusing] there's the same spelling for both meanings ;)|`|d1RQlCeIaa	i think math sounds weird too, and the Americans who are saying people will think sound like retards for calling it maths are wrong because we all call it maths so no one notices. I think you've got so many answer because a little country row has started here and everyones so insistent on abusing each other over an "s"|`|RFgApGNsaa	because they are odd and american *she said fondly* <br>  <br>   I think the REAL question is:<br>   why do they think we talk funny when its our language???<br>  and think we have the accent|`|yQC7wezBaa	rubber = condom not eraser<br>  a fag is not a cigarette its a very bad word to use in america<br>  pop tarts in america = good food, pop tarts in england = your gonna need a rubber|`|ukFI400eaa	This is a pretty ignorant question. I'm sure Americans think a lot of your customary phrases are weird too. :/|`|AhoB10CTaa	MathS? as in more than one math? you don't call it phsychologyS or englishs or physiologys??|`|m6ZFQV1qaa	Because if you say "maths" instead of "math" people would think you're a retard.|`|3sbjV043aa	Cuz they are americans.|`|VxE46bSFaa	Maths?

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Who said she was killed?<br>  <br>  Alice. (Oh yes that is right.) She is the only one that said she was killed. It could have been a suicide. Shane dumps Jenny and she drowns herself in response.<br>  <br>  If you go by body response it was Max.<br>  <br>  If you go by motive it was Bette.<br>  <br>  The one that logically should be the last person Jenny meets is Tina but that does not seem to happen. <br>  <br>  And then, there is Nikki sitting in the bushes. What was she doing there dressed as she was? She knew what was going on as she was in the clip Jenny made.<br>  <br>  Here is the odd point. No one missed her prior to the dog barking. Tina was looking for her. Bette had already seen her. Shane and Alice were talking about her.<br>  <br>  Where were Max, Kit and Helena? They have no placement at this point and Max went to get a sweater like Tina but she does not seem to put it on. Why? <br>  <br>  And what of Dylan, who has reason to hate Jenny but was not at the party? <br>  <br>  The clues seem to be the music and the dog and the fact that shane and Bette dove in to save Jenny. Who let the dog out? Whose tune spoke of murder. <br>  <br>  I have watched this a couple of times and if I get a clear winner I will tell you.<br>  <br>  I would rule out the two drunk girls Helena and Alice. <br>  <br>  I would not rule out Max even though Jenny was a close friend. No motive but loads of opportunity.<br>  <br>  The person with the most to gain from her death is Shane but the person who seems the mostl likely to kill Jenny is Adele, the girl who wrapped up Lez Girls. Assume Tina told the production company what happened to the negatives and Adele might be there to get the film<br>  <br>  I truly do not know but I am guessing it was Jenny.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	sorry, never watched it. but as for who killed jen, im right here and im fine. thanx for asking though! lol|`|Xy4kHpteaa	I have no idea, that was one of the worst series finales I've ever seen and the show was created by Showtime which is a high quality TV company in the states, they usually strive to have the best finales. Not to mention how short it was, I don't think I've ever seen an eight part American drama series, they usually air twelve episodes at least.<br>  <br>  As for who killed Jenny, I don't think we're supposed to know. The episode set it up so that every character had a reason to kill her even Jenny herself. Personally I think it's up to the viewer to decide who did the crime. I don't know, but somehow I feel like she went and offed herself, for some reason that just feels right, but who knows?|`|p1mSR5Awaa	what? they killed her? damn. i never finished the third season.

wA8Dyhq7aa	I'd go along with the Sedaka, Denver, and Elton/Kiki song.  I actually love Neil Sedaka -- he's a fabulous pop singer and songwriter and his oldies in the 60s ("Happy Birthday Sweet 16," "Calendar Girl," "King of Clowns") are among some of the best songs from the early 60s.<br>  <br>  I'd have to add to the list:<br>  "Take the Money and Run" - Steve Miller.  The worst rhyme in all of 70s music.  The problem is, you can't tell if the rhyme deserving that title is the "Texas / facts is" line or the "El Paso / hassle" line.<br>  <br>  "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" - Vicki Lawrence.  This song is SO STUPID (yeah, little sister is mad because her brother was wronged by "his cheatin' wife" and his best friend so she kills 'em both, but then she keeps her mouth shut and lets 'em hang her brother for murder????), but what can I say.<br>  <br>  "On and On" - Stephen Bishop.  I'm surprised to find this is on a lot of people's "worst songs" list, but I've always found this song appealing.  (BTW, Stephen Bishop played the guy whose guitar John Belushi smashed in "Animal House.")<br>  <br>  And the worst of all....<br>  <br>  "Saturday Night" by the Bay City Rollers.  I guess it came along when I was the right (or wrong) age.  I was never a fan of theirs but this song always stuck out.|`|IatEdBpvaa	I'm totally with you Migh, in fact I was in a record shop a couple of weeks ago and they had Bad Brains - Banned In D.C. playing.  When that was finished, what was next?  Yes, Wilson Phillips debut album.  It was truly a wonderful surreal moment.<br>  <br>  And no, I have no guilty pleasure songs, I'll freely admit to all the cheese I like and take it like a man.  It helps make up the total package.  Here's some that could be included in that category though.<br>  <br>  The Carpenters - Goodbye To Love<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nooeMrCws-A&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nooeMrCws...</a><br>  <br>  Debby Boone - You Light Up My Life<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxo0lsJnx-U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxo0lsJnx...</a><br>  <br>  CW Mccall - Convoy<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb6tjk8SlzQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb6tjk8Sl...</a><br>  <br>  Mac Davis - Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UauHDIlhvTk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UauHDIlhv...</a>|`|283tO9j9aa	Anything by Abba :P They knew how to write a tune!<br>  Baby One More Time- Britney Spears<br>  Without You- Motley Crue<br>  Heaven- Bryan Adams (oh the shame)<br>  Total Eclipse Of The Heart- Bonnie Tyler<br>  <br>  and many others.

Ew7hXGFtaa	ZOMG Karl likes Blind Guardian!!!! :O =P<br>  <br>  Dude, I'm guessing I have seen that video over a 100 times and it gives me chills every time. Blind Guardian is such a great band and they've influenced so many bands today! <br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: That crowd is so pumped to be there and I don't blame them. Blind Guardian always kicks tons of a** but they did especially in that performance. From all the crowd surfers to everyone singing along it just makes me wish I was there!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Not my kind of music at all, but WOW.<br>  <br>  The instrumentals were phenominal and the singer didn't have to act all hardcore to get his point across.  That truly is an awsome song.<br>  <br>  I can't really answer your other question, I don't know too much about it.<br>  <br>  BA: Not quite as crazy, but Queen at Live Aid preforming Radio GaGa had everyone into the song.|`|15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	Not bad.<br>  <br>  But you think new metal bands owe these guys anything? No more than Blind Guardian owes  Steppenwolf or Iron Butterfly whatever they owe them. Steppenwolf was the original metal band and Iron Butterfly gave the genre it's title.. And the lead singer for Blind Guardian here is working the crowd much like Eric Burton, John Kay and Doug Ingle did.<br>  <br>  And as to Doug Ingle and Iron Butterfly (the band that heavy metal took it's name from)? After Iron Butterfly released it's album 'Heavy' with the 17 minute 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida' they made the original mold that all newer bands copied from and heavy metal took it's name from the album 'Heavy.' <br>  <br>  In fact, Blind Guardian does covers of Iron Butterfly's music, including a really horrible version of 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.' <br>  <br>  So, who owes who what debt and when?|`|wDOjkaYUaa	This song is...<br>  <br>  No Bueno!|`|3jt5QXbvaa	It's good, very Iron Maiden sounding. These are the kinds of bands that I love watching play cuz their excelent with their insturments but but I never really like the vocals|`|O5xCjej1aa	That song is a freakin A++. Nice one Karl.|`|7fEVNng5aa	I'm not a big Viking metal guy, so I couldn't really comment on that. The song was pretty damn cool, though. <br>  <br>  BQ- Love seeing the crowd that into the performance. It seemed to take the musicians up a level, too.<br>  <br>  Anecdote time- I saw White Zombie on the tour for La Sexorcisto, in a relatively small theatre here. Not tiny, but certainly no arena. They did a *very* long version of Thunderkiss 65 for the encore. When it started I was down in the pit, but I was getting tired. So I ambled up the stairs to find a place to rest my weary bones, but there was nowhere to go. The entire theatre had turned into a pit. People were launching themselves over seats, down the aisles. It was pandemonium, and I'm honestly shocked nobody died that night. That was the most amped up crowd I've ever been a part of
xANHGLDvaa	lol i agree with you :p<br>  <br>  (no offense)|`|pMnMgt4Vaa	Everyone that has answered this question, stated something regarding the look. How it looks retarded, or ad-normal. Meaning that you are comparing non-BlueTooth users to BlueTooth users. <br>  But in the question, "What Do You Think of People That Use Bluetooth Headsets", is referring to the idea of BlueTooth and not so much as to the people that use them.<br>  I think that the invention of BlueTooth has made many people look and feel more into control. I think that the BlueTooth has made work much easier, and more convenient. -Such as the business man on a business trip, using his cell phone for long periods of time while driving, is now hands free.<br>  Now when I see kids wearing them, it looks ridiculous. <br>  I think that the invention of BlueTooth has changed the way of talking. However,  I think that owning a BlueTooth, and using it in the car and less frequently inside a store or in a restaurant, wouldn't be such a bad idea.<br>  But yes, I agree that there are many people that over use the BlueTooth, just for the advanced technology look.|`|VxE46bSFaa	Haha I think they look really stupid. And they probably think they are just so important that they need their cell phone literally connected to their ear. I hate when someone is trying to talk to someone using bluetooth, but when the bluetooth person responds, you can't tell if they're talking to someone on the phone or whatever.|`|X1HynJM7aa	Well, in California drivers have to use them,which doesn't bother me, but what bothers is when people walk around with<br>  them and are talking on them, they look like a bunch of idiots<br>  talking to themselves.|`|XZBY1JXnaa	Well we have to use them here in California when we're in the car but they do look kinda weird when people use them when they are just walking around.

When I was coming home from my 'vacation', I didn't sleep all night. I was wayyyyyy to excited. So I stayed up watching FNMTV and Room Raiders. Of course I was way to jittery by the time we were getting in the car to drive to the airport. All my energy was gone by the time we boarded our flight. I couldn't even keep my eyes open for the take off.|`|Lljkj0EFaa	Party on and sleep on the train.|`|2ktp7dEUaa	No, just sleep on the train.|`|Nv3eQenUaa	If the train comes to me, I have no problem with it.    <br>  The nearest train station is a long ride away in Atlanta.

You will be a little groggy, but at least you would have gotten a little bit of rest. |`|LSNffo4jaa	Maybe, but if I only sleep 2 or 3 hours I feel worse than if I hadn't even slept.  |`|wDJRyzE9aa	Depends where the train is taking you I suppose.|`|Q7CgXolCaa	Probably not..I honestly feel more tired if I get like 2 or 3 hours of sleep so I usually just stay up in those cases.|`|mggll8dRaa	Get all the Rest (Sleep) that You Can...!!|`|9ilXVowLaa	is the ride long enough to sleep on the train? if so,i'd do that

VxE46bSFaa	Sometimes I have to help move heavy stuff, but I prefer to just tell people when they're too close to the wall. If they can lift it, they should help.|`|nqcnylFpaa	my wife helps me move heavy furniture if she wants to|`|oDGttkmLaa	Well, that makes a little sense.<br>  So, if you and your wife 'offed' someone together...would you dig the shallow grave and she would make a lunch? or would she dig and then you put the body in? OR maybe you'd bury the body and she'd put the lilacs over it so no one could find it?<br>  I just want to know for next time Big Vinnie comes by looking for a hand.|`|EnFguUb1aa	i do both. it's not a gender thing, it's how all people pitch in how they can as an individual. i'm stronger than some of the men i know, and weaker than other men too.|`|GedjSOI9aa	Whoever can carry the heavy lifting stuff then they should do it regardless if it's a man or a woman.|`|IWD93HW7aa	Women can help carry things... and men can help pack up the boxes...|`|l4DpWVnBaa	i think if a woman wants to help let her.|`|KyLPuSoQaa	i think women are even with men they can do anything men can do...i think if a women wants to be stereotyped by people like you who think that women belong in the kitchen...<br>  <br>  thats what i think|`|e701Kqykaa	I think it is up to the woman. She should at least help with something.

The edge lives in the first.<br>  Although, it is a tough call.<br>  John Lennon didn't even like people and contradicted himself all the time. <br>  "Imagine no possessions", he trilled, in one of the most revolting of all pop songs, and heaven knows, there are enough to choose from. One man who couldn't imagine a life without possessions was the man who urged us to give them up. No sooner had he recorded it than he put his Weybridge mansion up for sale, with every penny going to the Jolly Jack Lennon Benevolent Fund."<br>  And Sir(they'll knight anyone these days) Bob Geldof gets the limelight for stupid sh*t like this<br>  <br>  "During the broadcast of Live Aid, Geldof shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities but also by slamming his fist on the table and practically ordering them not to go out to the pub and to stay in and watch the show. The harrowing video of dying, skeletal children that had been made to the tune of "Drive" by The Cars, contributed to the concert's success.<br>  <br>  He's so passionate about the cause. (putting my finger down my throat)<br>  <br>  Just found this from" If*ckinghatecelebrities.com"<br>  The New York Daily News reports that Chris Martin declared from the stage that “[Live 8] is the greatest thing that's ever been organized in the history of the world."<br>  If by “world” he means “self-important British rock stars” and “thing” he means “emptily symbolic rock festival,” then I cannot disagree.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Would you rather Bono did nothing?  Just because you encourage others to give to those who are less fortunate doesn't mean that you don't get to enjoy the wealth you have accumulated. I'm not some raving U2 fan, but I think stuff like that is silly. Sure, it's excessive to buy your hat a first class ticket, but dude's got enough money to live excessively and give a lot of money to charity. Why isn't he allowed to have it both ways? It's not like he rails on, asking people to give but gives nothing. He can do both without being a hypocrite in my opinion. He doesn't tell everyone else to give every possible dime, just to give period. I assume that you can apply the same train of thought to Lennon (though I admit that I know less about him in that respect).<br>  <br>  I just think it sucks that he takes so much flack for trying to help feed poor people and get medicine to sick people. I mean would you prefer he was just another vacuous, pointless rock star whose only contribution is to create jobs by trashing hotel rooms or get drugs off the street by putting them into themselves. I understand if you're tired of the spiel, but it doesn't make him a bad guy.|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Not commenting about the material concerns listed in the above question, that's a non-issue to me. <br>  <br>  I am just going to talk about Lennon.   Love the guy and his music.  I think he is genuine.  One thing that bothers me is the relationship he had with Julian.  Pretty much well documented that John did not cultivate a close relationship with his oldest son.  While his fathership toward Sean was totally loving and nurturing.  My feeling on the matter was John was an all or nothing guy who, when committed, gave everything he had but when the he lost faith in something he complete abandoned it.  Maybe his divorce with his first wife cause him to have guilt feelings.  Those guilt feelings disrupted his ability to be close to Julian.  (I am taking the high road here.  I do not really know why John acted why he acted.  In just looking at what can be seen about the only thing you could conclude is that John Lennon was an a$$hole when it came to his son.)|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	I choose both. Both lived in excess while preaching about sharing all possessions. In other words, share YOUR stuff, but I will keep mine. I have no problem with them living lavishly, but don't preach to me about how bad it is for me to live that way. Don't drive a SUV because it f@cks up the environment, but I will say this while driving my limo to my private jet.<br>  <br>  Anyone else as bad as these two?<br>  Al Gore, Barbra Streisand, and Sheryl Crow comes to mind.|`|AA11039335	Haha!

He tries to make a difference to the state of the world, he is not perfect and doesn't need to be. If one wants to change the world you doesn't have to be perfect, if you wait for the mantle of perfection to drop onto you before acting you will never do anything at all would you? And just what is it that you do to make a difference then? Sit at your keyboard and slag off those who have a go?|`|NQ3XZElFaa	To be fair, I don't think Johnny Rotten was ever seriously political. "God Save the Queen" and "Anarchy in the U.K." were basically publicity stunts. They admitted it was all a swindle, so good for them. I don't know who's more ridiculous: the people who piss and moan about Rotten selling out by appearing in commercials (he was always a sell-out) or the morons who are inspired to become "anarchists" after listening to "Never Mind the Bollocks."<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question, Rage Against the Machine, who constantly preach against capitalism, apparently found a passage in the Communist Manifesto that allows them to sell a special edition of thier album only at Best Buy.

Qw4l9R68aa	The Who!<br>  <br>  That black magic woman won't fool me again!<br>  <br>  Tell your sister people won't remember Britney Spears in 10 years if she's lucky. The Who and Santana will live forever.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Santana easily. I vastly prefer Santana over the Who. I own Santana's entire discography up through the mid 80's. I only own 4 Who Albums.<br>  <br>  Unh Uh, The Who did not "do more" for Rock than Santana, they just sold more records, actually Santana contributed more to Rock by admitting the Latin influence into Rock, The Who are just overrated.|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	The Who! I believe Rodger D. And P. Townsend just won some lifetime awards or something.<br>  <br>  Santana are cool too and I was never in to them but their music has always been playing somewhere throughout my life- They both bring back childhood Memories<br>  <br>  Brittany Spears rules in her own way! She gives crap a different meaning. Not that she is crappy or anything like that-That stuff that she sings just makes me picture crap! I love to put her music on and crack the stereo all the way to off!!!|`|5uzHW4CYaa	The Who, most definitely<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I'm not much into the newer music, anyway. It seems as if most of it is just butchering it. *sigh*|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I like The Who better personally, im just not that into Santana. Well, not at all actually...!|`|GSwjoipVaa	Santana is good but I'd pick The Who anyday.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	The Who did way more for rock and roll than Santana did.<br>  <br>  The only real reason I like Santana is because a couple of its memebers went on to form Journey.  Carlos Santana is a great guitar player, no doubt about it, but they just didn't make that great of music.<br>  <br>  No point in arguing with your sister either man, she obvoiusly isn't going to let you win.  If she is stating that brittany spears is better than The Who, something ain't right.|`|hth11Uilaa	uhhhh<br>  <br>  The Who.<br>  <br>  Obviously. Why are you even debating someone who has a poor taste in music as is? Sorry but, Brittany Spears and "top 100" music blows and people who actually consider it "good music" just are in a different category to me than those who realize how horrific popular music is these days.|`|6D4a6PoVaa	Santana's best song was stolen from Fleetwood Mac.<br>  <br>  The Who by "miles and miles and miles".|`|PtZeqxFjaa	The Who,but I like Santana also,and tell your sister they both played at the first Woodstock|`|oUZLZusjaa	Personally I prefer The Who, never really got into Santana.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Santana.<br>  <br>  Never really liked The Who.<br>  Too cheesy.<br>  Too lame.<br>  <br>  No class.|`|ld1vh7nHaa	i prefer santana. his cover of fleetwood mac's black magic woman is okay.

Never did, but very cool instrument.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Nirvana crap? Sure<br>  <br>  Anyway, most people in this section know quite a bit about the various instruments in rock music.<br>  <br>  Like the guitar, bass, drums, hurdygurdy, dulcimer, banjo, keyboard, sitar, dobro, harmonica, synthesizer, etc.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Probably the most unfitting stereotype I've ever heard.|`|L4f5ONEkaa	wth!<br>  <br>  i know a knowledge of instrumental variety<br>  i play guitar and keyboard/synth<br>  along with the drums and now im learning bass<br>  my step dad teaches guitar and bass<br>  <br>  and i can listen to almost all types of music except country<br>  and i even listen to rap and i still like rock and metal<br>  and all the sub genres that come with it<br>  <br>  we have more knowledge than those miley cyrus and<br>  jonas brother fans and those other crap groups<br>  <br>  and the person below me it does count<br>  i bet i know more about music than you do<br>  and than you ever would|`|KEk728Gsaa	What do you think?

I'd go because well, legally you have to or you're put in jail, and I'd feel like I owed it to the country. Although, I could understand someone dodging the draft, cause like in Vietnam it was practically a suicide mission. Not to disrespect the veterans, my dad was one, but look at the death toll of the Vietnam War and it speaks for it self. But besides all that, I doubt we'll see the draft any time soon.|`|4kmUFEutaa	no I would not go I would come up with something or get a Dr's excuse like I used to when I was in school LOL<br>  <br>  Or I would say that I was gay!

aRDWH8Qraa	that's what a silly teenager would think|`|qUiXiZ6aaa	ain't nothin' wrong with that quote!|`|xUfRRGM8aa	Nothing wrong with being cautious. <br>  <br>  "One cannot be betrayed when one has no people."<br>  <br>  This is true, but I do not live it. There are far worse things to endure than betrayal. Betrayal implies love, and possibility. At least betrayal is a passionate emotion.....better than washing through life with indifference, eh?|`|8c4d7def9b4a2ac0298a97da01d5c5b7aa	Lots of people end up thinking this way, to protect themselves.. But as many people say - it's not good to keep your heart closed and hide behind walls. Life is about loving and receiving love along with all the other emotions. You can't be truly happy by hiding behind your walls. I try to open my heart despite the past bad experiences.|`|qYmDZbW2aa	Yes.  Though one can betray themselves.  <br>  But, yea i guess you could say I live by this since I have a hard time trusting others.|`|12cfaa03d9af3554ae03057ace0f0ef3aa	No, but I know various people who do.<br>  It makes sense, in a way.|`|HwmRwupmaa	I do not immediately trust my friends. But once I start trusting them there's no looking back.. I was betrayed few times too , but percentage  of friends who betrayed me was much much lower when compared to the people who were trustworthy . So I think we can sure trust people by your whole heart. And it is mutual .. when u are trustable , others do not let you down.|`|VxE46bSFaa	I disagree. Even if you won't be betrayed, you'll be deprrived of friendship.|`|YGrmwndLaa	Totally! Cautious trust (or conditional) is closer to my mantra.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	everyday , mine is said a bit differently <br>  <br>  trust no one but yourself, <br>  <br>  <br>  its a tattoo i have in korean on my chest right side over my heart |`|MpTgh6MMaa	i think that makes sense<br>  i should live that way when i think about it|`|jxw1O0EFaa	Confucius, I think.|`|8uCuoLvdaa	yep.<br>  it works.|`|dHfFqVqhaa	sure |`|f8nby9bmaa	you should look at the good things in a person, and keep the bad in the back of your mind<br>  if you don't trust anyone, you don't love anyone<br>  but if you only trust yourself doesn't that make you concieted?<br>  <br>  also, you don't have to trust anyone, just be nice, and don't judge quickly.  I don't trust many people but they know that's the way it is, and i'm still going to give them the respect i give anyone else<br>  <br>  so no i don't live by that, but that doesn't mean it's not ok to trust only certain people.  If you don't confide in others they won't confide in you.  that's what i live by, a moral known by many followed my few!|`|lVb1Gj08aa	After recently just finishing a really bad relationship i've definitely reinstated this idea ha ha although i think its more about living for ones self rather than through another.|`|PWc4pEBUaa	well everybody know this is true but does one really want to live in a world, completely alone?|`|9nsOdcdSaa	Now I do, i've been backstabbed many times.
539aSIVtaa	yeah i agree, but being freinds with everyone is POSSIBLE just not GOOD freinds, more like someone to talk to is all but being good friends with everyone isnt possible, think about the time people! no time for EVERYONE! lol|`|D0GDAhVDaa	yes, they aren't very sincere or there for you.|`|R2BBjtaraa	jdajf|`|WYrNwcZqaa	I love how everyone is going emo, immature.|`|u2wR9XFwaa	No|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Nahh, I don't agree. :)|`|FvBj6bWwaa	no|`|3e25qiOoaa	in a way it does make sense.<br>  cause you know that saying would you rather have a lot of friends or 1 best friend? HA, in yo face rude people.<br>  <br>  because if you think about it, when youre friends with everyone, youre not friends-friends, jsut friends with most, and do you agree with everyones opinions? like theres gotta be someone that annoys you.what they do anoys you and who are you gunna tell and have bff secrets with with your friends with everyone. ugh its really hard to explain|`|2e03d9c0ae13a3d9eea4f64e4eb3a52aaa	Agreed! Those people who try to make everyone happy have no loyalty. I had a friend for many years and then he acted friendly towards 2 of my enemies on the theory that they're MY enemies not his and so he lost my friendship. How in the world can I ever trust someone who is friendly to my enemies?|`|W8mtFq1Aaa	I was gonna say, "Whats that supposed to mean?! Ur so shallow."<br>  <br>  But then I thought about what you said and in a weird way, it could make sense. I hava a friend whos very social and has so many friends that her knowledge about their doings and time spent with them is very limited. She has too many friends.<br>  <br>  But then a again, personally, im a very friendly person. Im more of the quiet type but that works with most ppl so i have A LOT of friends. Most of them are VERYY close to me.<br>  <br>  So I guess I agree and disagree with you.If that makes any sense at all.... |`|2wtSxTMRaa	i somewhat agree. you can't be friends with everyone. i mean, you can on the outside, but you don't go with exactly what everyone says. you have to choose sides.. don't you? hmm... good question. starred as interesting.|`|qYmDZbW2aa	100% agree with this.<br>  Been there, seen that.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	no|`|b7ejGDAwaa	that makes no sense at all|`|VxE46bSFaa	I understand, but I disagree. You can be a friend to everyone, but friendship can survive not being pleased by your friend. True friendship can survive fights.|`|54E62nd5aa	If they're a friend to everyone then obviously there friends to EVERYONE, stop being emo. You're not deep|`|AmfdE0cvaa	no cause everybody is their friend...riiight? :/|`|SH5WQN0Jaa	yea, they cant really choose a side, they just stay in the middle, it soo annoying....|`|UMlow8ndaa	EMO GET A HAIRCUT YOU PUSSSSSSSSSSSSY.|`|dKQN0FXQaa	uhm nooo. they would be freinds to EVERYONE. you need to rephrase,|`|kFnBlYTraa	I Dont Get It|`|B86AhUPwaa	no|`|diYIS9V1aa	ya sure

Such is life...<br>  <br>  I have lost many (due death), long time ago my first girlfriend, then at least two of my former classmates, lost my father when I was 20 (and all of my grandparents are already gone), several colleagues, some business associates lost during few years, and my birthday-party guest list has been shrinking with such speed that after few years I don't need invite anyone (as apparently all of them can be soon found from the graveyard...)<br>  <br>  So, I am no longer optimist.., but realist...<br>  And I am not old...|`|djhCah5Maa	They say only the good die young.

T85WCEltaa	Although Brian May and Roger Taylor are brilliant musicians in their own right, and contributed much to Queen, I agree with your statement - Freddie WAS Queen!  Also, the band currently calling itself Queen is only half the band - they're also missing John Deacon, who again, was an essential ingredient to the band's greatness.  In my ideal world, Brian and Roger would still write brilliant songs, but perform them under a different name.  Listening to 'Queen's' latest offerings (with Paul Rodgers) they have lost their unique sound - Freddie was and is irreplaceable as a frontman.  Like many die-hard fans, I won't be buying any more 'Queen' in the future. :(|`|SbPW2ZVeaa	Absolutely. He was a legend and although Queen continues without him, they'll never be the same.|`|4x5ajsUpaa	Couldn't have put it better myself, you are indeed correct. The band should rest with Freddie (I don't mean they should have the same fate, just let go while they are still highly thought of).|`|9fb116a0ee9f78e1ed0abd04ae59a95baa	Totally|`|VwEUO6reaa	queen were a great band and freddie was the front man...no one can fill his stripy trousers its as simple as that|`|2GdZSXC1aa	Yes i do agree. It just not the same!|`|AA10711210	Yep!|`|qRM0r7eVaa	Defo..no one can replace him.|`|EpVNEzcSaa	it's like a BLT without the B. <br>  without Freddy, they just aren't the complete sandwich.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Agreed, but they aren't trying to be Queen anymore.<br>  <br>  They only still use the Queen part because they had no idea of what to call this new thing they have.  Brian and Roger don't want to replace Freddie, and they aren't trying to move on with Queen.

AN82B8syaa	NO.<br>  I'm probably gonna get tons of thumbs down, but I think chocolate is overrated. Like its cool sometimes, but when people act like chocolate is the best thing ever... its really not.<br>  There was something on Food Network like that where a cake had chocolate gnosh (sp?) filling, chocolate frosting, chocolate shavings and all kinds of crap. It kind of makes me wanna puke.|`|P6j9ns5Taa	chocolate|`|VxE46bSFaa	I love chocolate.

J16qHdJYaa	There's a difference between Urahara 'owning' him and getting blindsided. Yammi also didn't know what Urahara was capable of, so he wouldn't have had a reason to go full-bore on him.|`|pbDTx9FLaa	My guess is that Yammi just wanted to make himself look tough and stuff.
BbiyBG0oaa	Ya, but his bankai is still new to him along with his hollow powers.  His bankai didn't necessarily do much against byakuya it was his inner hollow that actually used getsuga tenshou and surprised him.  Basically his inner hollow is what made him win the fight against byakuya.|`|J16qHdJYaa	He stated in the fight with Byakuya that the Getsuga Tenshou is the only attack he's learned from old man Zangetsu so far. And during the  Arrancar arc, he's been relying on the combination of the Bankai speed and his Hollow strength to get him through. I do agree it *seems* useless now, but if he actually learns something new, it'd be a nice sight.|`|AA10930560	IT IS!!!!! I haven't seen him more patheic than now..AND HE'S IN HIS BANKAI!!!|`|uqjEXAOmaa	ehh, i got out of bleach right after that, it started getting to dragged out|`|hSpsroCXaa	His Bankai has been useless for a while now if he is not in his Vizard form. <br>  <br>  ***SPOILER**** if you don't read the manga.<br>  <br>  In his current situation with Ulquorra in a Second released form <br>  (Him being the only Espada to reach it)<br>  and Ichigo being close to death, i think he will go back into his hollow world or even back against Zangetsu and gain a new ability.<br>  Because i don't think his Bankai or his Vizard form are even close to being complete yet.|`|7fsqT04Iaa	it sjust you
6rR7LTl1aa	Because a Japanese manga-ka wrote it.<br>  <br>  Other than that...everything is "spirit" this-or-somesuch.  It took a jointventure between Urahara Kisuke and Kurotsuchi Mayuri to bring the scientific method to the Court of Pure Souls.|`|AA12024265	The Sei-Rei-Tei, or the Court of Pure Souls, looks like :: <br>  <a href="http://www.bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Seireitei" rel="nofollow">http://www.bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Seireit...</a><br>  <br>  Rukongai closer to Sei-Rei-Tei looks more like Edo Era Kyoto.<br>  <a href="http://www.bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Rukongai" rel="nofollow">http://www.bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Rukonga...</a> , and this link fits both this answer, and ..................<br>  <br>  Rukongai further away from Sei-Rei-Tei looks more like Heian Era Kyoto.<br>  .............................This one, too !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Xv9odLdcaa	They have the technology but the shinigami are "above" human necessities. They wear traditional kimonos so the setting had to match. It adds to the feeling that the shinigami are spiritual and not worldly beings.<br>  It's feudal to give it a distinguished appearance. It is a society of classes and nobility. The parts of the rukongai that are shown are stricken with poverty. Apart from being spiritual, the souls that live in the rukongai are poor so they must struggle. Even if they had technology, like the real world, there would still be poor people and lower classes.<br>  Also, Tite Kubo (the creator) probably wanted to make sure the audience could tell the difference between soul society and the real world. Soul society has a unique appearance that is easily recognizable.

(noticed your display pic)...<br>  <br>  BA: Syd Barrett<br>  Jimi Hendrix<br>  Steven Tyler|`|WENGBNXhaa	"I Don't Want To Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith<br>  it's a good song but it's annoying now<br>  <br>  BA: Nikki Sixx<br>  i'm currently reading his book and i never knew how much drugs messed him up. i feel sort of sad about all the crap he had to go through|`|eokH64z0aa	The Offspring - Sedated <br>  <br>  I liked that movie Idle Hands [lol] when it first came out and bought the soundtrack. Ironically, the soundtrack was 100% better than the movie. Sedated was a song on the CD. |`|eafe4f9115768bed7213bd38347fc7c5aa	Jason Mraz's I'm Yours.<br>  <br>  Its a nice little song, I used to enjoy it, but every time I get in my car I near it on one of the 3 stations I flip between. It is SOOOOOOOOOO overplayed. |`|1XMlA3Btaa	ugh i listened to holiday in cambodia one to many times i guess and now i just cant stand it! to bad though, its a really good song... hahaha|`|yLz5eA7Daa	The entire Wall album was so overplayed when I was younger that I don't care if I ever hear it again.

IizPFrELaa	Controversial<br>  <br>  Bible says "eye for an eye", but is killing someone who killed the right really the "right" thing?|`|EblQojpEaa	No, I believe that we treat serious offenders too lightly. The death penalty to me is an easy way out. I think we should make our prisons like the movie MIDNIGHT EXPRESS then maybe people will start thinking about doing the crimes first. Now they just do it, whats jail, 3 squares and free medical and shelter.<br>  <br>  I think if serious offenders rapist, child molesters and murderors, had to suffer those conditions they would think more before they act. I also think those types of crimes deserve life sentence. No parole, no escape. Just dirt, scraps of food, and abusive prison guards for the rest of their days. I bet the massive populations in todays prisons would be drastically reduced.|`|AA10471659	If the supreme court says it's constitutionally right , Remember that is the decider for our country,  it's right.

Two wrongs don't make a right. "Eye for an eye" is the most barbarian idea, and it's a joke that people still aim to use in today's world. The bible, and religion in general, should have nothing to do with a government, which is not supposed to have opinions, and shouldn't be out for revenge. And consider this: What pays for the death penalty? Tax payers' money. Thus, every time the government executes someone, they are making all of us murderers. If you can morally accept that, than you need to look at yourself a lot harsher than you already do.|`|VxE46bSFaa	I do not agree with the death penalty. By killing someone who killed someone else, you're just killing more and more people. Unless the person was a serial killer or something like that, they shouldn't be given the death penalty.|`|dBB1nOY5aa	only if you murdered someone and the evidence and proof is 100% correct. otherwise i don't believe it is right. i only believe in those shots, not the gas or hanging or shooting like the olden days. nice question, it made me think :)|`|GGh2Rpoqaa	if they intentionally take another person's life,<br>  & they dont plan on repenting // changing their life.|`|xsk9JWqpaa	yes i do, they took someone's life whether it was on purpose or  not, but they took it so now theirs should be too|`|6xdAArNfaa	yes I do..<br>  people that do really bad things and are very dangerous have to pay with their life, or that's what I think.<br>  xD|`|E86nEUdzaa	yes.

Only to child molesters and murderers.|`|vK4tR3mDaa	NO|`|7oS8nB6Baa	if someone kills someone then they deserve to be killed|`|p03Jc7eHaa	if you kill someone in front of people who saw you yes,otherwise no|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Only if it's clearly 100% positive that they are for certain guilty.

rUFBXL3Uaa	Could possibly have something to do with the Guitar Hero game. I saw my little brother playing Guns n Roses songs and this guitar battle thing with Slash.<br>  <br>  Also it's in the media more frequent than usual because of the new album coming out so it's generating loads of hype.<br>  <br>  I don't really like Guns n Roses|`|6J2aNUuFaa	All I can say is that Slash is NOT overrated.  Just like all the most well know lead rock guitarists before him, his image is created by us, the fans; fantasy is what makes rock stars well...rock stars. The fact is, anyone who really pays attention to true musicianship can recognize that Slash really is among the greatest lead rock guitarist.  |`|DQusetDNaa	They have really good production and a general cool sound. I'm not objective since I've liked them since I was a kid, and now it's just nostalgic to hear them, but all of what you said, Slash's overrated solos, Axl's whiny voice, Izzy's sweet guitar, Duff's awesome bass and Matt's solid drumming, that's what I like about them.|`|SNJj0Ayvaa	Nothing really, atleast in my opinion, i agree with what you just said about Slash being overrated and I hate Axl's voice as well, ever since the put GNR on GTA San Andreas, every just seemed to love them, especially younger people who never heard of them before, long story short, they are not even that good of a rock and roll band|`|Y3qHZlQBaa	they were always really popular. Slash is way too overated. He ok, nothing to brag about. Axls voice Is ok but not the best ive ever heard. I think kids like them because they are a band that is apropriate and their parents won't gat pissed if they listen to them as opposed to if they listen to a band like slayer|`|X2WHPMuSaa	All i have to say is OMG. <br>  <br>  Seriously, how can you say Slash is overrated. I'm not here to insult anyone and I would never do that but I think you need to listen to his riffs and licks a few more times. <br>  <br>  I'm curious, what are some of the guitarists that you feel are talented and great?|`|jSfGIreSaa	I've like Guns N' Roses for a while ok. Im 14. i like em because, eh i don't know, i like they're songs! GAh! I can't describe! <br>  <br>  <br>  You forgot Steven Adler!! GOSH! Haha just kidding|`|oonb6rXYaa	I dunno. They are pretty good. I can't explain it. The New Gun 'N Roses is gonna suck, though.|`|4bb2309ab015e2beb168982cffb42893aa	Well the kids like them now because of Guitar Hero. It's better than the other stuff out there, anyway.|`|k7jGZydJaa	I don't know why I like them. I just think their songs sound good.|`|OypAfgDfaa	I grew up around them I guess, my dad is a huge fan...so, rock music just kinda got passed down.|`|wTNAOcl1aa	I like Axl's voice.<br>  <br>  *edit- Yeah, slash is highly overrated, but he's still great. And axl's a good vocalist, but a shitty person.|`|cVqCryr6aa	I'm not sure either, they have some good songs, but they seem to have an awful lot of filler on their albums.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I've always been drawn in by Slash's style.  He is a bluesy kind of guitar player, and I try to play the same style, so I listen to thier stuff.  Axl's voice is one you either love or hate, I personally find it unique and I like it.<br>  <br>  Guns N Roses is just a name younger kids know, be it because of Guitar Hero, or the fact that there are hundreds of shirts being sold at Hot Topic, etc with the GnR name.|`|utTFiz3gaa	I love the old Guns N roses i hate the present one though seriously.. although they did get some pretty good guitarists to fill in for the former members (i'm 16) I think they have awesome songs and i love Slash <3 <br>  <br>  I guess we all have our diff opinions :)<br>  <br>  Maybe the 10-12 year olds like em because they heard their music in guitar hero/rock band.. I mean it doesn't hurt for them to like it<br>  <br>  p.s. i extremely dislike Axl|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I have to go with Lauren. I just like the songs. I really don't have a reason behind it. <br>  I do like Axl's voice in GNR and I do agree that Slash is kind of overrated but at the same time I think hes a very good guitarist.|`|Rmy8bWnsaa	I agree, I never could get into them. Don't know what their appeal is either.|`|Io1aOqKkaa	This is what happens, <br>  Guitar Hero, i like it, but it gets a lot of poser fans for good bands. <br>   So little children that play guitar hero 3 ask, then they find out that the dude that is on the cover of the game is Slash, and they sudendly are i  love with Guns N' Roses, even if they don't know the rest of the band.  Maybe they are little posers know, but someday they will turn to be real fans. <br>   <br>  |`|U48HUZ5Kaa	Im 14 And they make good music. Welcome to the jungle just makes want to do something fun and dangueros while november rain is a great love song. BTW From that list Axl is the only person still in the band.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	I just heard the new lp, and it's better than any of the old stuff. I don't get it either. They only did a few albums, they all sucked but the first one, and it had some real weak stuff on it.  |`|efQ0hac1aa	My brother's definitely a fan. And I do like Axl Rose and Slash. I love Axl's unique voice. The last thing we need is another musician that sounds like all the rest. And Slash is an amazing guitarist. Definitely my favorite guitarist. |`|Buq0tpypaa	because of ******* guitar hero<br>  i think axls voice is to hardcore for the songs he sings<br>  <br>  the only good gnr song is one in a million|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	They don't have much appeal to me, i like a few songs but that's it. Axl has an awful voice. |`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Well at least they are better than the jonas brothers shite|`|WENGBNXhaa	they were awesome but i can't stand Axl at all. he needs a life

LkN5nr6faa	Steve Perry is a spectacular vocalist, and I must also add that I believe Neal Schon is one of the most underrated guitarists of all time. Unfortunately since so many people find it "uncool" to like Journey, Neal is completely overlooked. I love Journey, and I love the musicianship. I'd call them one of the most infectious bands ever.|`|uLEpOpSMaa	I actually think Steve Perry has far superior vocal qualities over Freddie Mercury.  Freddie Mercury has a great voice but he relies more on his high falsetto versus the amount of heart that Perry puts into his singing.  Perry also is better at holding notes with a strong melodic tone for a long time, and rolling his voice effectively.  In most Journey songs, Steve Perry sings with at least 25% more punch than Mercury does in the strongest Queen songs.<br>  <br>  Here's an exercise for all of you saying Mercury is better than Perry.  Sing a verse of "Another One Bites The Dust" by Queen, and then TRY to sing the first part of "Separate Ways" by Journey.  After your voice hurts, make another bias claim about which is better.<br>  <br>  I hate how macho "cool guys" are too stubborn to admit that they actually like Journey.  They are an exceptional band and had more hits than Queen ever did.  I like Queen, but lets not kid ourselves here.<br>  <br>  I saw Journey live in Minneapolis about a year ago, and they still rock hard!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Steve Perry is good, but he is nowhere near Freddie Mercury.  I am a huge fan of both, but Freddie just has way more range.<br>  <br>  I love Journey, and I think they were one of the best bands of the 80s.  Neal Schon is a great guitarist, and very underrated.  Steve Perry doesn't get much credit, mainly because most Journey music was too similar, and he really didn't show much range and difference.<br>  <br>  I  got to see them live in September.  Arnel Pineda, the new lead singer is very good, and sounds very similar to Steve Perry.  The band still sounded really good, they were very entertaining, and I will be sure to see them again if they come back around.|`|utTFiz3gaa	Perry's voice is really great<br>  <br>  I like em!! :)<br>  <br>  I like "Don't stop believing" (of course) and "Lights" :)|`|uti3vIU3aa	I love Journey, but without Steve Perry they will never be the same. I know Neal said that there was a Journey before Steve Perry and there will be a Journey after Steve Perry....but not in my book. Steve Perry was, is, and always will be the heart and soul of Journey. |`|FxX8O1BWaa	whow, he's not freddie mercury material =p<br>  <br>  i don't think he's one of the best voices in rock he's in the top 50 but not top 10 at all. i like journey they have a nice sound to them|`|e6f2a75405d891ee2ea28023f697809eaa	Journey is back with a new singer Arnel Pineda.  Their new album "Revelation" has reached platinum and their just concluded concert tour was one of the most exciting tour this year.|`|DibFrwxlaa	I never liked them.

f8iN0Ujraa	Capisco benissimo, anche io sto cercando di ri-formare una band! Beh io sinceramente di quel sito non mi sono mai fidata più di tanto, non so perchè, però come già detto suggerisco il sito del Mercatino Musicale (dove comunque i musicisti che girano sono sempre quelli, almeno quelli della mia città -_-). Oltre questo ho messo annunci sui vari forum (sia forumfree, nelle sezioni adatte, che forumup, in particolare in un forum di canto) e poi ho adottato il solito vecchio metodo di lasciare il mio numero e una breve descrizione dei requisiti richiesti nelle bacheche dei negozi di musica, di strumenti musicali e nelle scuole di musica (compreso il mio conservatorio): questi ultimi sono quelli che mi hanno fruttato i musicisti migliori! Per cui, gambe in spalla, armati di volantini, scotch e buona volontà e girati tutta la tua città :D La musica non aspetta ;) In bocca al lupo!|`|RtaDDNI9aa	ti accendo una stellina xk anke io sto cercando una cosa del genere x formare una band|`|OcM33f0qaa	io so mercatino musicale un sito molto serio di annunci<br>  ciao|`|szK7bFzOaa	<a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=xiIEn0ezvuo" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=xiIEn0ezvu...</a>
9mPux1fFaa	You forget that just because it is night time where you are doesn't mean it's night time everywhere else! When it's midnight in the UK it's midday somewhere else in the world. So the moon glows because the sun can still reach it. That's why you get half moons (where the sun only reaches half of the moon) or sometimes you get no moon (where the moon is completely hidden from the sun)|`|N5ncEyI0aa	its not shining, its just crying because the sun gives it to him everytime he passes by|`|VxE46bSFaa	It's reflecting the sun's light.|`|gZUPV8feaa	It refelcts off the suns rays - that is the answer. x|`|LYygh76Iaa	Because it wants attention.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	stfu with moons already!<br>  <br>  every one is obsessed with damn moons!|`|Lw9oSwphaa	its reflecting the light of the sun.

POqwp3Fiaa	Ha ha ha, I love that one, gere's another:-<br>  <br>  <br>  Little Johnny comes home from catholic school with a black eye.<br>  <br>  His father sees it and says,<br>  "Johnny, how many times do I have to tell you not to fight with the other boys?" <br>  <br>  "But Dad, it wasn't my fault. We were all in church saying our prayers. We all stood up and my teacher in front of me had her dress in the crack of her butt. I reached over and pulled it out. That's when she hit me!"<br>  <br>  "Johnny," the father said.<br>  "You don't do those kind of things to women."<br>  <br>  Sure enough, the very next day Johnny came home with the other eye black and blue.<br>  <br>  Johnny's father said,<br>  "Johnny, I thought we had a talk!" <br>  <br>  "But Dad," Johnny said.<br>  "It wasn't my fault. There we were in church saying our prayers. We all stood up and my teacher in front of us had her dress in the crack of her butt. Then Louie who was sitting next to me saw it and he reached over and pulled it out. Now I know she doesn't like this, so I pushed it back in!"|`|6Vm28sw4aa	that was toooooo perfect!!!   star for you and three smiley faces!!<br>  <br>  :) :) :)|`|J7EWQHYJaa	LOL!!!<br>  peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet??????|`|1LEa5iVHaa	the girl with the cone joke is better! the eel was stupid|`|AA11164472	Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question. "Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left ?"<br>  "None.",replied Johnny. "'cause the rest would fly away." <br>  "Well, the answer is four," said the teacher. "But I like the way you are thinking." <br>  Little Johnny said, "I have a question for you now. If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one licking her cone, the second biting her cone, and the third one sucking her cone, which one is married?"<br>  "Well," said the teacher nevously, "I guess the one sucking the cone?"<br>  "No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger. But I like the way you are thinking."

YjZJBDY2aa	To be honest. I have heard to many things I don't know what to believe.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	study all in a comparative religion class...that is what i did and found the perfect fit for me. Who knows what happens-|`|MMBZYhu6aa	None of us know for sure....whatever some might tell you.  It is just that some have faith in a certain belief!  I personally believe there is a god/creator.  I am not sure what will happen when I die.  I am not so sure about the heaven and hell idea.  I would like to think that we have many more lives, then we get to go to heaven, when we are ready!  I don't follow a certain belief system.  I also think that if somebody is not religious and they are the best person in the world, then they will go to the "good place" too!  I think your after life depends on who you were as a person, not what you believed!|`|CApnEZ83aa	If you have been baptized and believe then you go to Heaven.|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	Knowing my friends, I'll probably be stuffed and turned into a coat rack.|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	We keep coming back...|`|DG2Nv8vkaa	Logically i don't think there is anything after we die. You close you eyes and that's it. I would like to think that there is more, as it would be a shame to think that all we get is a fraction of time to achieve all that we can. The sad reality is that for some, that fraction of time is filled with misery and suffering. <br>  For that reason i believe that this is were the belief of heaven and an after life comes from. Human kinds inability to accept that this life is all we have. I sometimes think that maybe if we did except that fact more readily would the world be a better place? By which i mean, would people be more motivated to achieve and do more with the short time we have, rather than fill their time with fighting, wars, hate ETC. Would we realise that the time would be better spent achieving goals, learning about each other and realise how lucky we actually are to be blessed with life itself. MAYBE?|`|lxrQyQ5raa	I believe that energy has to go somewhere.  So I think that you come back in another form.  Unless you have unfinished business then I believe you are a ghost of the form of yourself because you have things to settle before you can move on.  I hope though and everyday I want to believe that you go to heaven and be with the ones you love again.|`|v0owu3cBaa	After we die we are buried and put into our graves. If you're a sinner you'll be punnished in the grave or if you were a good person in life you would be granted good stuff in your grave. After some time when the world will come to an end everyone will rise from their graves and will stand before God and will be accountable for all their actions. Their deeds will be balanced and only if the good deeds are heavier than the bad ones then the person will get to go to Heaven or else they will go to hell. <br>  <br>  So watch what you do. Act right. Believe that God is One and Most powerful. According to Jesus that was the most imporrtant thing to believe. Whatever way you act right now will determine what you get after your death! Be careful!|`|w0dSfhBHaa	You go to Heaven or Hell. Praise God, live by his law, and you will go to heaven. Don't... you go to hell.. basically, there is a bunch of small details, but... yeah. Good luck!|`|RtJ11zUZaa	What I believe:  Nothing.  Nothing happens<br>  What I want:  Infinite knowledge|`|fvIXGXopaa	I believe nothing happens.|`|PYmdmuw8aa	I believe you are just a soul in the universe.|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	I believe when you are dead, that's it.|`|T3MqaVZdaa	you have one life so just live it do whatever you want and just don't ruin it for yourself! but it think you are reborn but just don't remember your life before! that what i found pout in religion class|`|fWwsWOauaa	What happens to you after you die depends<br>  on whether or not, you repented of your sins<br>  and accepted Jesus Christ.|`|MTYAwCftaa	don't i wish i knew ... :(|`|yev2iWgWaa	same for all why worry?i had answered in detail about my real feelings

QPPcUyyyaa	Well, the method you're talking about works like this:<br>  <br>  1)  You put the name in a letter.<br>  2)  You send the letter to the Post Office, and have them deposit the letter into a safebox which you own.<br>  3)  You never, ever open the safebox.<br>  <br>  The post office is a government bureacracy (one of the reasons they suck so hard) so they keep records on all their files.  They'll have a government record of when the safebox was opened last, backed up by the post mark on the envelope.<br>  <br>  The idea is that if someone DOES steal your idea, then you can open the box under legal witness and prove in court that your idea pre-dates theirs.  <br>  <br>  It's a stupid idea.  Safeboxes cost money, and your idea isn't worth stealing.  People do this because they don't want someone to steal their inventions or intellectual property, like song lyrics or computer code.  No one's interested in a band name.<br>  <br>  If you're worried, you can always buy a copyright, but those cost money too, and need to be renewed every so often.  <br>  <br>  My advice: stop worrying about it.  Besides, I'm sure someone's already thought up whatever name you've come up with first.  But, if you want to try, you can do it here:|`|vJZYIGJBaa	I'd say stop focusing on your stupid band name start focusing on getting better so that you can make it big, and make millions of dollars.|`|058qleIWaa	hmm im not entirely sure how to go about that. ive had friends that had the same name as another band, my friends were the first to come up with it but the OTHER band got signed first therefor they were able to keep the name and my friends were forced to change theirs.|`|ibeFIUpkaa	Get a Website TODAY<br>  <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.godaddy.com</a><br>  <br>  And register your  band name.<br>  It will be less likely that someone else will want to keep your name if it's already registered.|`|cSa4bWRWaa	Do a patent..thats a sure way.|`|Sdy2G97daa	pick something that is really stupid so no one will want to take it|`|5d1uZn1Yaa	Got to a Notary and have it copyrighted.
NC67WVlEaa	It basically boils down to, "Don't get your hopes up about the band. People say they're great but, they really aren't"<br>  <br>  : )|`|AgQForcYaa	If you hear a lot of people talking about a band, chances are, they aren't worth all the talk the receive. <br>  <br>  You know, Coldplay, Radiohead, Muse, Paramore, Fall Out Boy, Panic At the Disco, and countless other bands.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	It means just that.<br>  <br>  Don't believe all the hype around something.  Or, don't believe all the talk/buzz something is getting.|`|Zs6ykhF0aa	It's basically, "Don't believe what everyone else is saying. It might not be correct. Don't believe all the gossip. Form your own opinions."|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Basically it means don't believe all the garbage that 95% of the sheep espouse.<br>  <br>  BAH!!!!|`|DaH0rOghaa	Fisrt answer got it spot on

It's kind of sexist now that I think aout it. But women are usually the one cleaning or taking care of the house. Few men do.|`|OOvukMJsaa	Wow, you're right. Except for Oxy Clean, Mr. Clean, ShamWow and Bam. Actually, Mr. Clean is usually giving his sponges to women...|`|UVViEAkTaa	you're forgetting mr. clean, & the bam/shamwow guys.<br>  |`|b7ejGDAwaa	mr. clean and that "bam" guy are not women

Just listen to whatever you want to listen to|`|YlCgMDVwaa	Well it depends on your intention to get into it.  Why do you want to get into said extreme genre so badly?|`|4txNIOuCaa	nope.<br>  not unless you are not being yourself. When you start changing how you dress and talk and what you do, then its way to far.<br>  Go ahead try new music, but still be  yourself.<br>  Sometimes people look different than the music you like, so don't change who you are.<br>  I mean, I listen to like Brokencyde and Bring Me The Horizon, but I shop at Hollister... yeah its weird.<br>  Just be yourself, don't force yourself to like something you really don't|`|oI1Vox4paa	nope.  It just means you're open-minded and willing to give something a try for the sake of saying you tried it.  Or in a case that you actually might like it.<br>  <br>  To "Music is Religion":  Not all Metal is crap!  Only when it has the prefix "Nu-" or the suffix "-core".  Then and only then is it crap!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I surely hope someone wouldn't think such a thing.|`|jA1ukKSHaa	No not at all... Everyone has to Tip-Toe into Metal haha

oeO8Tgroaa	Take a good strong heart and stand true to your first calling and you will be fine. Don't sell out the band for one thing and don't let the band be destroyed like so many before you.|`|2T8vRvwMaa	It is a bit tricky to just "form a band and get famous", especially if you've only just started learning how to play the guitar. Once you have learned playing the guitar, you've got to pick up your songwriting talent which is easy if your a decent guitar player. However, there is a difference between being a good songwriter and a good songwriter who writes good enough songs to get famous/recognition. And by the way, don't get "songwriting lessons" and don't bury your head in music theory...why? Because number 1. Songwriting can be learned easily, simply by playing the guitar and knowing the guitar and what sounds good, and you have to be a natural talent to get famous for songwriting anyway. And number 2. If you bury your head in music theory and you become some major music geek, rather than a genuine songwriter, you will have no time for your own creative talent to flourish. How many Violinists playing Mozart are famous and wealthy musicians? None. Why? Because they drowned themselves in theory for whatever amount of time while learning a boring instrument and now they play boring songs that you'd be lucky if old people even like anymore. It doesn't mean they aren't true musicians it just means they aren't in it for the money obviously. However, if you are forming a band for one primary reason which is to get famous...don't, because a true musician likes the music and has a connection with it. Anyone who forms a band for money will end up being hated in future by their fans and they will end up hating eachother. Is that a good answer?|`|ajNTSffmaa	I want to see you two perform all ready.

LAsfAMmMaa	I've heard some people say that people in them are gay... but i doubt that.|`|k1FenuRLaa	less fornicating, less teenage pregnancies|`|AA12069383	i don't know but i don't like them. i think it sets them up to fail in society, especially when it comes to dating.|`|BsAQE1Hyaa	I have never really heard much about all boys or all girl school, most the schools around my city are mainly mixed, and most people I know came from mixed gender schools. I think a lot of private schools are like all girl and all boys. But from what I know most public schools are mixed. I think  they are a good idea actually, I think it would take a lot of pressure of kids to keep up with peers and have relationships and sex  so early on in life.  :D<br>  <br>  Happy holidays x|`|qcuXR1Msaa	I think it's worse in an all girls school cause it's really bitchy, it's actually vile.<br>  But there's no awkward crushes or anything going on.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It doesn't stop teenage pregnancies, like 4 girls dropped out of my year in 6 months from being pregnant, there were at least 2 abortions (don't start the moral argument, I didn't choose it) in that 6 months too.|`|lAi5T2Qsaa	it keeps kids from being thrown into awkward male/female situations and relationships before they are mature enough to handle them and when they do get to have socials and mingle it is closely monitored.  only common in the us in religious schools, mostly catholic.  should be more encouraged|`|ufU0VNLUaa	so that the students can focus on schoolwork instead of dating.its pretty smart if you ask me. But you do need to get out of it sometime lol. its like a prison|`|5yDnw2oRaa	I have had experience of both single sex and mixed schools in the UK.<br>  <br>  Between the ages of 4 and 14 I went to an all girls school and I loved it. Then from the age of 14-18 I went to a mixed comprehensive school, which was terrible. Although the mixed school was the best school in my area I found a lot of the boys to be very loud, disruptive and things to be more complicated. When at the girls school I think that we all grew up feeling very comfortable with ourselves as there were no boys to distract us. We weren't worried about boys fancying us or who had a boyfriend and who didn't. We concentrated on just being friends without jealousy and rivalry. It was also much easier to concentrate and I got much better grades in the girls school. Being with just one sex also eliminates a lot of embarasment when you're a teenage girl. <br>  <br>  Although I spent most of my school education just with girls I always got on very well with boys also.<br>  <br>  In the UK many private schools are single sex (mine was a private convent) but state schools tend to be mixed. I do not know how this compares to America.<br>  <br>  When my partner and I have children we will be sending our children to either a boys or a girls school, not mixed. x<br>  <br>  ADD<br>  I am still friends with most of the girls I went to school with (it was a very small school) and none of them are gay. If you go to a single sex school you end up gay is rubbish. And I found the mixed school a million times bitchier than the girls school. Everyone just got on.|`|w7kb5l1uaa	Stronger long lasting friendships<br>  No distractions<br>  Nothing is off limits to talk about (we talk about sex in class all the time)<br>  Less Drama<br>  Closer to with everyone <br>  Freedom of expression b/c people aren't worried about what boys are going to think about them <br>  Become more professional<br>  Handle situations better|`|Mz2JmNCcaa	It's kind of common in the UK, especially in private schools. In general, apparantly girls work better in an all girls school, most likely thanks to less distractions. However boys work worse. I kind of agree, since I attend an all girls school and our school is higher in the ranks than the other all boys school, but..I dunno, because i can't compare it to anything else. Hope I helped :)|`|XM9iHUeGaa	1. quite common paticually in private and grammar schools.<br>  2. not sure but i think more<br>  3. different learning techniques, less distractions<br>  4. no co-ed all the way - normal life is.|`|kvTt0oXQaa	god knows. whoever came up with the idea must be an absolute idiot though, how can seperating boys from girls benefit anyone?|`|xIFbJXUyaa	in australia it's kinda common  but i don't see any Point in it just limits time boys and girls get to hang out|`|JcEYEPJBaa	not sure but i know allot of those kids who go to schools like that are freaks!

24UPDIBTaa	Originally, ABC Family shot a one hour pilot version of Samurai Girl based on a series of books. Then they decided to turn it into a mini-series, which is what aired. You'd think fulltime series would be the next step, but maybe they weren't happy with the mini-series' ratings.<br>  <br>  You can sign a petition (linked below) urging ABC Family to turn Samurai Girl into a series.<br>  <br>  Frankly the Samurai Girl and Fallen mini-series were more interesting than what ABC Family is about to debut as series to me. <br>  <br>  Venting about ABC Family ensues:<br>  <br>  "Family" programming is always about keying on a somewhat young audience, despite the connotation that it's intended to be watched by the entire family. At best, they market it to youth and see if those youth can bring along other eyeballs (their parents'?) for ratings purposes. Someone should remind ABC Family of this as these new shows' lead actors are older and have a hard time passing for “tweens“, teenagers, and in some cases young adults too. I understand Disney is contractually bound to keep family in the channel's title and may not be thrilled about it, but they should embrace it.<br>  <br>  Coming soon:<br>  <br>  Sophie--<br>  French Canadian show is re-made for English speaking Canadians and then the rights for American broadcast are bought by ABC Family. Show features a 35 year-old actress as a talent agent who gets pregnant by someone other than her boyfriend, life goes off rails, blah, blah, blah. No lead character in the neighborhood of being a teenager. The Secret Life of the American Teenager has several actors that are actually youthful and it already covers a lot of the same territory. It's not something I'd watch, but at least it features an appropriate age group. On the other hand, how does Sophie fit on ABC Family? Even if it's good, it's out of place. This show would be more appropriate on fellow Disney owned channels ABC, SOAPnet, or Lifetime (50% Disney owned).<br>  <br>  Roommates--<br>  The producers behind Reba and Rita Rocks thought it'd be a good idea to do a show about people a couple years beyond college (again not all that relatable to your target audience) in close quarters basically remaking Friends. Were there a lot of Friends fans clamoring for this sort of thing? I'll give them this though, the attempts at humor in the commercials look juvenile. ABC Family would've been better off sticking by The Middleman's cult following than bother with this show.|`|HqRSCXOTaa	..............(\__/)<br>  ..............(='.'=)<br>  ..........☆(")_(")☆?<br>  ????????¨*`?.☆...☆?.?*¨????????

I mean, you've got Rick Moranis, Bill Murray, Dan Akyroid, Sigourney Weaver, and Harold Ramis, all excellent actors. It was absolutely hilarious, and it's a shame it only had two films.<br>  <br>  And oh my God, thank you first answerer!

Instead of it being about Jesus's birth it is about santa and reindeer. The stores set up for it. People begin singing about how they want all this crap instead of the classic songs. I mean my friend's family does purily for having family over and giving away presents. My family is still very religious about it, but the stores set up earilier every year and more sales happen. Craziness. |`|V63jOkvsaa	Well I'm atheist and I don't celebrate Christmas, although I do go to my families Christmas functions.

DibFrwxlaa	The word emo may be short for emotional but in the context of rock music it has a specific connotation that refers to a particular style of music.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	AMEN!!!!!!! Finally someone that shares my thought process on this!!<br>  I think the exact same thing. I am soooo sick of people using the word Emo in the wrong context.<br>  <br>  Emo does mean emotional-whether it's happy/sad/angry/whatever. I think most songs are about emotion of some sort so yes, All lyrics, all genres are emo.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	exactly..thats why its such a stupid label...i get emotional when i listen to "changes" by black sabbath,, so does that make sabbath an emo band??..who the hell ever came up with that stupid word...|`|m0YRAhh4aa	All lyrics, well, most of them, at least, have emotional context. Particularly "emo" stereotyped lyrics tend to have the same type of message, though. You can always tell them apart because they will usually play heartbreak to an extreme, giving instances of death and physical agony to exemplify these emotions.|`|RvnBuOROaa	emo is emotional, but specifically stereotyped as "sad and about love" so in that case most are.<br>  <br>  <br>  i like to not think about stereotypes and genres, becasue its just a way to get mislead about bands.<br>  <br>  <br>  listen to The Rites of Spring.<br>  do they sound emo?<br>  well they triggered the emo movement, and i know a bunch of kids into punk who would be into them if they werent stereotyped "EMO"|`|9FclCgcbaa	thank you for understanding the meaning of 'emo', my dear (:|`|V17liBvXaa	Yeah emo-tional..<br>  <br>  People just call emo kids emo because they are too depressed and weird
RvnBuOROaa	it really depends on how easily you learn.<br>  i'm a ton better at chord theory, because i learned piano. i suggest you invest in either a keyboard, or a diagram of one, because it will help you understand harmony, chords, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8ths.<br>  its really what you want to learn<br>  you could learn rhythm if you had a metronome easily (i did... i just have trouble keeping on track)<br>  notes are a bit harder, but those can be accomplished.  same with symbols in notation.<br>  i suggest you get a good guitar teacher who will not rush (if you rush you won't learn it right) and say your not bad, you just want to learn theory.<br>  <br>  harmony is a bit hard though. same with keys/keytones. and crazy time signatures|`|m0YRAhh4aa	If you practice enough, I am sure you can do whatever you want. Don't give up. It won't all happen overnight, but keep practicing so you can follow your dream!|`|bPIVZXQnaa	I went from not even know what frets were to being able to slam it pretty decent in a matter of three months of playing about 2 hours a day, so if you can dedicate the time, I think you have a pretty good shot at it. Good luck!
fjNxzd6Baa	Are you saying you want completely customizable packaging? Or how about the ultimate al a carte viewing where everything is pay per view? That way you would absolutely never pay for anything you didn't expressly ask for.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	What's this have to do with soaps?|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I agree. It is crazy. We want a few sports channels but to get the few you want, you have to order this whole big thing of them, they go to waste, same with other stuff too. They should let you pick a certain number of channels and have them at a price and leave it at that.

lpyWVR2oaa	This type of relationship only has two outcomes in my opinion:<br>  <br>  1) They find that the other fits into their idealized vision of a 'perfect mate' and are able to merge not only on a mental, physical, emotional realm but more importantly, on a spiritual level as well. The so-called complete and utter Soul Bonding with your Twin Flame. If this happens, which is rather rare in reality, they are really lucky.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  2) When reality hits hard, they find their ideals shattered to the core and disillusionment, dissatisfaction and depression set in. This is more often the case when both don't have realistic expectations of their mates but rather, uphold a PROJECTED preconceived idea of how their mates should me.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	It sounds like a Juno Pluto linkage. But it has to be something more than that. It could be a two way but if they just met then it will fade without something stronger to hold them together.

PjHd7SEHaa	It's called a Magnificat. There are many different types of them too. And there's probably hundreds of versions of them.<br>  I know that Pachelbel wrote 95 magnificat fugues.<br>  There are any number of them composed, you couldn't list them all.|`|3h17hxraaa	The Magnificat is not really a song at all, it is actually a type of prayer called a canticle. It can be sung or spoken and is used by many Christian denominations. In Catholicism it is used in the Liturgy of the Hours or Divine Office. This is the Latin version.<br>  <br>      Magnificat anima mea Dominum,<br>      et exsultavit spiritus meus in Deo salvatore meo,<br>      quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae.<br>      Ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes,<br>      quia fecit mihi magna, qui potens est,<br>      et sanctum nomen eius,<br>      et misericordia eius in progenies et progenies<br>      timentibus eum.<br>      Fecit potentiam in brachio suo,<br>      dispersit superbos mente cordis sui;<br>      deposuit potentes de sede<br>      et exaltavit humiles;<br>      esurientes implevit bonis<br>      et divites dimisit inanes.<br>      Suscepit Israel puerum suum,<br>      recordatus misericordiae,<br>      sicut locutus est ad patres nostros,<br>      Abraham et semini eius in saecula.<br>  <br>  Many, many composers have set this text to music. The choir versions you may have heard are probably the shorter versions used for singing during services. There have also been very large and elaborate "concert" settings by many famous composers, such as JS Bach, Vivaldi, etc. There have been settings composed since the very early Renaissance all the way up to today.<br>  <br>  So whenever the you see the title Magnificat - it will be a version (Latin, English, Italian, etc.) of the text above set to music. The actual number of musical settings is unknown, but there are very many. Hope that helps.|`|NJaZBgDwaa	"What a great question_ I think it should be starred"  *<br>  <br>  <br>  (*Said with disgust and sarcasm at the same time)<br>  Look it up, wikipedia might be a place to start... or google.

The word has little to do with the word 'magnificent')<br>   <br>  The literary merit of this poetic passage leads to suspicion that Mary did not say this, or anything like it!  She is said to have been as young as 13 when first she became pregnant, and was unlikely to have had any education whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Sometimes this recitation is sung, and it is usually sung by a choir.   As others have said, the numbers of such musical settings are utterly incalculable.  <br>   Some that I have long loved are by the Irish composer, Stanford.<br>  <br>  Bach wrote a 'cantata' length version of the Magnificat for soloists, orchestra, and choir.   <br>  You might well like this?  It is highly regarded, and is quite different to the chanted or syllabic versions of the text. <br>  <br>     Many other composers have used these words as the basis for an extended composition.<br>  <br>  Often associated with the Magnificat in liturgical usage is the 'Nunc Dimittis', the 'Song of Simeon', and a setting of both would be published as an 'Evening Service' for the Anglican Church by composers such as Vaughan Williams, and back for several hundred years. <br>    <br>   Some of the more modern versions are really interesting, I feel.   In your search for the Magnificat that you so love, it is very likely that you will find a dozen that you like even more !

Sì <br>  <br>  Opinione completa _______________________________...<br>  Ho finito da poco di leggere questo libro e l’ho trovato davvero interessante. Il Dott. Zichichi sa sempre spiegare con chiarezza gli argomenti che tratta. Sono d’accordo con quello che dice perché fa capire che in realtà tutto quello che si dice sugli oroscopi, astrologia e simili sono soltanto fantasie inventate dall’uomo che non hanno fondamenta scientifiche. L’alzarsi la mattina e leggere l’oroscopo per sapere come andrà la giornata è solo pura illusione. Non esistono le costellazioni così come ci fanno credere gli astrologi. I movimenti che avvengono nello spazio, le eclissi, il nascere a Gennaio anziché a Giugno, non hanno nessuna influenza sulla nostra vita. In più, il professore, spiega con esempi molto chiari che in realtà noi al giorno d’oggi dovremmo essere un segno zodiacale più avanti. Chi nasce sotto il segno dell’ariete in realtà dovrebbe essere Toro. Noi ancora ci rifacciamo alle costellazioni di come erano migliaia di secoli fa.<br>  Questo è solo un argomento che tratta questo bel libro, ma a questo se ne uniscono tanti altri adatti a far capire al lettore che l’astrologia non esiste, la nostra vita non è influita da nessuna costellazione o astro.|`|hUhm5eyoaa	capricorno , perchè l'acquario entra dal 21 gennaio|`|g8XQEfjwaa	Tu sei capricorno cuspide acquario, cioè sono quelle persone che nascono fra i segni. <br>  <br>  CAPRICORNO/ACQUARIO (18 - 19- 20- 21- 22 GENNAIO) <br>  <br>  T posso riassumere in due parole: tradizionalisti ma non conformisti. <br>  <br>  Siete veramente baciati in fronte dalla fortuna, il cielo è l’unico limite sulla strada del successo. Saturno e Urano aiutano a capire profondamente il genere umano e vi rendono intuitivi, pazienti, raffinati, originali, colti, amorosi e comprensivi, cercate di coltivare le capacità musicali e artistiche e di sviluppare la capacità <br>  di giudizio. Avete una mente viva e attiva, un senso chiaro di quello che la gente vuole e desidera, e il talento per arrivare proprio al punto che volete. Il carattere è serio, pragmatico ed ambizioso, con grandi potenzialità di arrivare al successo. Siete costantemente presi tra due fuochi: la tendenza a rispettare le tradizioni e il desiderio di vivere superando le convenzioni. Il modo migliore per affrontare e superare in modo positivo questa dualità è quello di fare appello alla notevole<br>  intelligenza, orientandovi verso studi o professioni che diano spazio anche alla ricca componente creativa che è in voi. Generosi e attenti verso gli altri, offrite un’amicizia sincera e leale e siete molto gradevoli in compagnia. Probabilità di successo nelle arti, nei lavori che portano a contatto con il pubblico, professioni di tipo umanitario. Vi piace combattere da soli le vostre battaglie e assai di rado riversate sugli altri le vostre preoccupazioni e i vostri problemi. La vita affettiva è maggiormente sviluppata in direzione della amicizia, amate attorniarvi di molti amici e cambiarli continuamente, seguendo l’umore del momento.<br>  <br>  Bhe, ti ho fatto un copia e incolla ma almeno ti ho illuminato, ti ho tolto il dubbio e sai una cosa che non avevi proprio idea. <br>  Che dire, sono da invidiare quelli nati nelle cuspide, racchiudono in sè alcuni lati di entrambi i segni. Specialmente tu che l'acquario e il capricorno sono due segno molto diversi. <br>  Ciao, spero sia stato d'aiuto, buon 2009!<br>  10 punti!?!?! xdxd|`|W6ZLuO6Gaa	Sei giusto alla fine del Capricorno.<br>  Il Sole, infatti, transita nel tuo segno dal 22 dicembre al 20 gennaio.<br>  Tutti i nati in questo arco di tempo, estremi compresi, sono capricorno !|`|sM42TGNCaa	Il capricorno e dal 22 dicembre all 20 gennaio, invece l'aquario inizia il 21 dicembre.|`|jBG4l41Maa	ovviamente kaprikorno,l'aquario parte dal giorno 22 quindi fino al 21 kaprikorno..le riviste ke ti danno dell'aquario nn sono molto informate!|`|mdL07kgUaa	sei capricorno... l' acquario,purtroppo per te :-) , inizia il 21|`|6c9U8dHLaa	sei capricorno, dal 21 gennaio cè l'aquario

nI2xSDhLaa	The sex of the person wouldn't matter....they would be dead..|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yahoo answers would NOT be a man. because men can't ask/answer that many questions at one time.|`|ifO1HGbDaa	I think it would be a magical cupcake that knows all it would have pink frosting and a hamster named tony, It doesn't prefer men or women just his genderless hamster XD!<br>  sorry i am just a little bored...|`|7HEZhx46aa	It would be a guy, who acts macho and manly in public, but secretly wears girls' underwear (and maybe even a teddy) in private.

I think she would be more of an older woman like a grandmother one who would be a bit more knowledgeable and also one who tries to keep her family in line when they get out of hand. Now unfortunately there are some in her family that misbehave and think they are better than everyone else "Trolls" but still loves everyone equally no matter who they are. Y!A's reminds me of the grandmother like the one in the movie "Soul Food".|`|1QlOz5wqaa	Yahoo would be a HESHE and who knows what it would be, probably bi.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	No gender... no sex ... no face... they would be a sexless robot|`|8916532c2ff3a2ef7f5a443265ce3b2eaa	Ha, definitely a woman .. whose PMS'ing.

She also is an expert in all subjects and has 5 P.h.d.'s !  If we're going to guess we might as well get intense about it,  she also is a fan on the Yankees.  By the way..she wears cheap sunglasses although she makes 400,000,000.00 a year.<br>  I'm a guy so there's no way that yahoo answers could just be some dude all sweaty and hairy sitting behind the computer with an encyclopedia in his reach...it just couldn't be.|`|a7wEsHfqaa	maybe is SHEMALE.|`|bVsz2VhDaa	It would deff be a girl.. it asks so many questions...|`|02B4F4u0aa	lol...im starring this becuz its interestingly funny!|`|hzxplycYaa	but it's not.|`|d1kmidbJaa	LMAO .... very funny ... you made me laugh...................|`|AA12284792	Now that you ask I think she looks like this:<br>  <br>  A girl with short bob cut that ties it into a pony tail. A cabbie hat thatshadows her face. LArge sunglasses. Bubblegum chesing. Hoodie and jeans. Hands shoved in poket sitting on a bench watching the world.

They should not have to feel guilty for living and that is how it would make them feel.|`|wnkj0b41aa	The mother.|`|kMtoorJoaa	I think the mother would blame herself. The other twin may never be told about the twin and then they won't be able to feel any feelings towards them.|`|LuWT8KQBaa	The mother.

It was her child.|`|PWoFBGzcaa	neither ... **** happens. the twin never knew his or her twin long enough to care and the mother would feel bad but she still got one kid out of it and would get over it quickly.<br>  <br>  technically the mother but honestly who cares.|`|9dNzAaMvaa	mother the mother probably wouldnt tell the other twin the mom would always know that it died though|`|jVZrIvdRaa	I think they would both be sad, but probably the mom more because she was waiting for it to come out, living and breathing.<br>  (:|`|elMLS9fMaa	The mother but the other twin would probably feel really guilty, as if it were their fault.|`|ATU2QDTSaa	Mother|`|KjqgPYw6aa	The mother, because she would be the one to remember who the baby was.|`|a85f7296bd89d164e65c09b343ee8a83aa	the doctor

hP2nzb2haa	Oh ya... sure you can, here the tips and please check out the website from Disney Family... you'll love it. Enjoy!!!<br>  <br>  The Dinosaur Party<br>  Have a prehistoric party with the living lizards. Hire one, if you’re okay with it. Now is the time to indulge in your little ones fascination with the Jurassic cast of characters. Dino parties provide plenty of game and favor ideas.<br>  <br>  Game: Sandbox Fossil Hunt. If you've got an outside sandbox, you're golden. Bury toy plastic dinosaurs (Not tiny plastic dinosaurs toy ones, BEWARE: toddlers still like to put things in their mouth.) in the sand and arm your guests with spoons, handheld sifters, and collection boxes. No outdoor space? Don't worry. You can create your own tabletop sandbox. Large water basins or even big foil turkey roasting pans will do in a pinch. (For inside fossil hunts, figure two children per sand container.) Check a local hardware or garden shop for sand. Be prepared to vacuum up after the party's over.<br>  <br>  Click here:<br>  <a href="http://familyfun.go.com/parties/birthday/feature/famf89dinoparty/famf89dinoparty6.html" rel="nofollow">http://familyfun.go.com/parties/birthday...</a><br>  <br>  Also, check this out:<br>  <a href="http://www.birthdayinabox.com/party-ideas/guides.asp?bgs=16" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthdayinabox.com/party-idea...</a>|`|8570479ada3440ab391f420fea968801aa	if he is into dinosaurs that would be a good ideal. see what he like first.|`|4IwTGwpyaa	Yes.|`|ibeFIUpkaa	Yes but you realize at 2 the party is more for you than him.<br>  <br>  If he's into a TV show like Blue's Clues it would be great also.<br>  <br>  Get a personal cake just for him (Small) and let him go at it.<br>  Take lots of pictures.<br>  <br>  Then serve the regular cake for everyone else.<br>  Have fun :)|`|cSa4bWRWaa	Yes..but make sure your kid likes the idea as well... it's his party, so make sure he'll enjoy it and will remember it for a long time.|`|BmXEfdOTaa	Yes! It's kinda adorable.|`|5d1uZn1Yaa	It is a good idea, but most children at age 2 develop their own likings. If there is a tv show that he really likes, i think it would make him happier than you randomly choosing a nice theme FOR him. For example, my 2 year old LOVES Spongebob Squarepants, and when i decorated her room with Spongebob, she totally went nuts! She loved it. So take into consideration what his faves are, and base his theme on that.

He ordered EchoStar to stop selling those PVRs within 30 days, and to end service to customers who owned existing PVRs.<br>  <br>  Lawyers for EchoStar appealed the decision -- and asked the appeals court to block the injunction. According to TiVo's release, that has happened. The block is only in place until the court determines whether the injunction should be stayed throughout the entire appeals process, which could take months, or even years.<br>  <br>  The temporary stay does not indicate whether the court is leaning in favor of TiVo or EchoStar, but rather a procedural matter|`|bf9af830f3345469c87a84f6130be520aa	It is kinda like a DVR, but has more hard drive space.

a61dba48a983fa5c3d20f3d5a3f752deaa	never happened to me before.. but what has happened is bad customers. Where do people get off calling in an order at 5 minutes to closing? Or sitting in the restaurant diddling away while we have clearly put up the closed sign and are mopping etc.. I have never had a bad waiter/waitress, nor have I had bad service what I have had is bad customers, every single day. So to me that says alot about how people treat the employees making their food.. it seems people have no respect for who is making their food, let alone the work that goes into it. So every once in a while when you get a little bad service or maybe a little bit of sour attitude, just think of how the person serving you has been treated all day by all sorts of other rude customers and then maybe you will have a better understanding. It gets harder and harder to be polite when everyday customers treat you like shlt.|`|74b6205cc366e1878f13dd7b555ef76baa	when they dump my dinner on my head? really i have had great service almost all the time|`|2x6Ca0foaa	Rudeness, and ignoring the needs of the customers.

qNvPOWymaa	The speech was that while Superman will try to hide himself in the guise of Clark Kent, he'll never escape being Superman. He compares the story to what The Bride is doing by trying to convince her that despite trying to run get away from him and live a normal life, she'll always be a violent assassin, something which she demonstrates on her quest for revenge.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	The point is that Quentin Tarantino is not an expert on Superman. Cal El is Superman and Clark Kent and he is not the only super hero to have to hide his true identity.<br>  <br>  What Tarantino was trying to say in an inept manner was that Beatrix was trying to hide who she was by marrying that guy in El Paso but knowing that deep down she is a killer at heart.<br>  <br>  The point was that she was no better than him,(Bill), and she could never escape who she really was, so, BB was no better off in El Paso than she would have been if Beatrix had stayed with Bill.<br>  <br>  Remember Beatrix told Bill she left because of him and what was best for BB.

95432374d687b11ff0a32adb6a14a362aa	i was 11 the first time I shot a gun and it was at a gun range so no.|`|C00Bd6eZaa	No, they should however be TAUGHT to use it SAFELY.  As many things it has the potential to be deadly.  Education is a key to a lot of our cultural woes.  Another large trouble is respect/self-respect.|`|JtDcmqDHaa	its illegal to carry a gun ,unless your a cop or have a permit for it.but if you are older than 18 its ok to have a gun in your house in case ,like if you live alone and you are scared of burglers|`|UbmoEh64aa	No because  your parents can help you learn gun safety and take away the curiosity factor about guns.  I had a gun in my closet at home from 3rd grade on and always knew never to bring it out or even touch it without permission.<br>  We would go hunting and then come home and clean the guns and put them up.  Guess I'm just lucky to have survived such a horrible upbringing, eh?<br>  School rights are of course less because of safety concerns.  The school setting has a decreased expectation of privacy due to the whole building belonging to the school district and being used by 100s of kids.|`|c9f4f25ac9d74e5f1e69bd57259aa983aa	at 18 you should know right from wrong no you dont have the right to buy a gun or use if in any manner. If you dont have anythng to hide in your locker then a warrentless search should be ok  and if you do have something top hide then i agree that a warrantless search is good if you want to harm yourself whatever but dont harm other people that may be at the wrong place at the wrong time. when you get out of school then you have thhe right to buy a gun at 21 use it and pay for it if you mess up and the right to free speech. Warrantless searches ok by me|`|AA10057011	Yes it is illegal. When you turn 18 then you should be able to decide but any age under that is too young. Guns are dangerous enough in the hands of adults. Kids don't need to have them.|`|I2kxvjDQaa	well the locker search at your school is different, cuz its not like its actually the kids locker, its school property, just like if you rent a house and the owner wants the cops to search it, the occupant cant refuse demanding they have a warrant, in that case they dont need one, cuz the owner gave them permission

No me pasó, como nos pasa a la mayoría, que comenzamos a escuchar una banda por algún tema que nos gustó, sino que lo mio fue una búsqueda decidida y pensada.<br>  Uno de los primeros temas que escuché fue COMFORTABLY NUMB y terminé llorando por la sensación que me produjo esa melodía que está en un climax permanente, es lo más fuerte que escuché en mi vida. Cuando unos días después le presté atención a la letra y vi The Wall me di cuenta de que no hay otro grupo que pueda reflejar sensaciones y sentimientos a través de la música como ellos.<br>  Cuando me metí a leer sobre la vida de Waters me enteré que no conoció a su padre porque murió el 2da guerra, a mí me sucede que yo no conocí a mi padre y me sentí profundamente identificada con él y con la manera en que transmite ese sentimiento a través de la música.<br>  Si bien no es un tema que me describe hay una frase que si describe a la perfección un sentimineto personal:<br>  "The child is grown, the dream is gone".<br>  Trad: "El ni?o ha crecido, el sue?o se ha ido (o esfumado)"<br>  Esta frase me pega muy fuerte porque pasé toda mi infancia so?ando con conocer a mi padre, cosa que nunca sucedió y cuando llegué a mi adolescencia desperté de esas fantasías infantiles, cosa que no fue nada facil de superar y que todavía me provoca mucho dolor.<br>  <br>  Y si bien COMFORTABLY NUNB no me identifica como tema, es el que mejor describe mi dolor...<br>  Cada vez que lo escucho se me hace un nudo en la garganta, y ni te cuento lo que fue hace unas semanas escucharlo en vivo a Roger Waters interpretarlo como tema de cierre en el recital.<br>  <br>  Saludos...|`|7fc59f4db32d90be7f94ee472015fcc4aa	LA DE PERDONAME DE LUIS MIGUEL A LOS 13 A?OS Y CUANDO LA VUELVO A ESCUCHAR ME SIGUE DANDO NOSTALGIA!!!!!1 SNIFFF !!!!

So i figure if you're into some other activity, a very bright lit room will keep you up.  Also, i would sometimes drink a red bull in the evening which would have no effect on me, but i'm guessing it kicks in a bit later and keeps me up.  As of now, it's just a habit.

RVr3K5CTaa	Angel est effectivement une série plus adulte et plus sombre en étant plus une parabole sur le monde réel.<br>  <br>  Buffy construit son univers. Au départ, c'est simple, d'un coté les  bons humains, de l'autre les méchants vampires et humains. Puis progressivement, ?a ne commence qu'en saison 3 (le démon qui vend les livres de l'Ascension, qualifié de pas méchant par Buffy), on s'aper?oit qu'il peut y avoir de bons démons, on en arrive à Clem par exemple. Le monde initial de Buffy, c'est la terre est le bon monde, toutes les autres dimensions sont des enfers jusqu'au jour où on apprend qu'il y a aussi un paradis (saison 6). C'est aussi un monde où au début, seuls quelques initiés connaissent les démons et vampires. Puis peu à peu on apprend que d'autres savent (saison 3 avec le dialogue entre le maire et le Shérif et la récompense donnée à Buffy par ses camarades, puis le gouvernement dans la saison 4, puis le trio de la saison 6)<br>  <br>  Angel prend la suite dans un Los Angeles où les démons cohabitent avec les humains dans bien des cas. Avec Lorne on a l'exemple du démon gentil, d'une dimension qui n'est que son monde d'origine pas un enfer. En fait Angel ne fait que montrer qu'il y a plusieurs dimensions avec des habitants de différentes espèces, des gentilles, des méchantes, avec une analogie avec les différentes nations.<br>  Il aborde aussi le racisme avec les mi-démon, mi-humain pourchassés par des démons adeptes de la race pure.<br>  L'apocalypse selon Buffy, c'est seulement la fin du monde des humains provoqués par les méchants démons. Dans Angel, c'est plus fin : l'apocalypse est provoquée par les humains en étant égoistes, de plus en plus violents, cupides etc. Les "méchants" n'ont rien besoin de faire, juste à laisser l'humanité se détruire elle-même.<br>  <br>  Dans la construction de l'univers Buffy, Angel apporte aussi la suite de la naissance du monde (on ne savait que la terre était dominée par les démons jusqu'à ce que les humains les en chasse, le dernier démon mordant un humain créeant les vampires) avec des précisions sur l'Age des démons, les dieux y régnant, la différence entre dieu et démon (à peine abordé dans Buffy avec Glory) etc, grace au personnage d'Illyria, déesse vivante, qui arrive bien trop tard, ne permettant pas d'approfondir.<br>  <br>  Enfin, la fin de Buffy, pleine d'espoir est contrebalancée par celle d'Angel : le mal est imbattable, soit on le combat ouvertement et on perd, soit on fait des compromissions pour tenter d'en affaiblir les effets néfastes et on devient ce mal.<br>  Bref, pour ne pas devenir le méchants, il faut combattre le mal, pas négocier avec les méchants (faites la relation avec la guerre en irak versus les négociations diplomatiques ...)<br>  <br>  Buffy est plus légère, moins orientée vers le monde réel mais la série induit le coté sombre d'Angel, comme un contrebalancier. Angel induit à son tour Buffy en complétant le Buffyverse avec Illyria. Une troisième série aurait pu, en prenant la suite des deux, vraiment super.<br>  <br>  J'aime les deux, chacune pour ses qualités et défauts.|`|66617b20db70de148637123e12f01c67aa	Buffy ! Scénario inventif, jamais les meme méchants, personnages attachants..<br>  J'ai pas accroché à Angel du tout ...|`|edab8a6e6dd779c5494e3d10f916942aaa	Angel, histoire plus "réaliste " et plus adulte.<br>  Buffy c'est pour les gamins.|`|qjD9kmmZaa	buffy.

Les personnages de Buffy sont plus attachant et certains épisodes (surtout ceux centrer sur Alex) sont rigolos, alors qu'avec Angel, j'ai jamais rit .|`|f7f539f834202badbe31b791f6080408aa	Angel est plus sombre mais je n'ai pas encore vu les deux dernières saisons, dur choix mais je préfère Angel car Buffy, même si l'histoire était très cool, était un peu gnangnan-te vers la fin ......|`|xRaGyugTaa	les deux sont bien mais je préfère buffy parce que je ne sais pas lol|`|PYj1l1Ukaa	Angel car j'aime bien cette série........|`|4f2dc39ae2cc820d0e8bc8fcf4c46585aa	Buffy est selon moi plus dr?le.

TOhdRTEeaa	Pues mira... esta muy entretenido pero a la vez te das cuenta de que tan lejos llegan algunas mujeres par alograr fama... yo creia que Hoopz , despues de Goldie, era la mejor para el pero... no, si te has enterado, solamente tres meses (o antes) de que finalizo el programa, ella se dio cuenta de que lo de ellos era solamente una "amistad", pero eso si.. se lanzo como modelo y hasta participo en un video musical.. De aqui que comenzo la segunda temporada donde Flav volvio a invitar a New York, pero de nuevo quedo como segundona siendo la ganadora Delishis, una modelo, y sobre esa relaicon no tengo muchso detalles. Igual algunas ex participantes, quisieron lanzarse como estrellas fugaces, de la otra que me entere fue de la polemica New York a quien le dieron su propio programa en VH1 (osea hasta donde llega la necesidad de rating y eso q este canal no tiene tanta necesidad..) donde ahora ella busca su pareja ideal<br>  Pero en fin creo que si divierte y esperemos ver la segunda temporada aqui en latinoamerica|`|1a71aeabcec7d00215f153889ca70618aa	jajajajjajajjajajajajjajaj admito q yo me volvi adicta aunq era de lo mas oridinario!!! todas eran unas pu.tas q no podian ser mas obvias dq lo unico q querian era el dinero!!!

OkTQpUzZaa	I wouldn't say it is really good, but I did enjoy it overall.  I am NOT a fan of Lindsay Lohan, but she did a good job as the rebellious, sex-crazed teenager.  Some of the things she does and says in the movie are hilarious.  Watch for something she does to a Mormon in the beginning of the movie.  Jane Fonda did a good job too.  There were some serious subjects in the movie (the major one being incest) that should not have come off funny - but they did.  That was probably the only problem I had with the movie, otherwise it was very funny and warm-hearted (in the end with mother and daughter on the side of the road embracing).|`|f920d43ca88934cbc542ccdd99ea037eaa	some parts are good, but mostly sukked.

Je pourrais te citer "la cité interdite" que j'ai vu récemment ou l'esthétisme a une part royale, et d'autant plus royale que les considérations de l'histoire ne sont pas évidentes à appréhender pour un occidental..|`|928f0c836b701d337fb1077365a992d7aa	300, sin city (meme mec d'ailleurs)|`|9cd22da5f5e0ed508fed63371a3f5bd9aa	Angel-A de Besson.

MQol9jqKaa	Virgo<br>  Fechas: 24 ago al 23 sep <br>    Piscis<br>  Fechas: 20 feb al 20 mar <br>   <br>  Hombre Virgo y Mujer Piscis<br>  Relación amorosa conveniente después de los 40 a?os; la virgen tolerará las frecuentes distracciones del pisciano así como su falta de madurez, recordemos que esto último es frecuente en los peces. En el aspecto intelectual, se comprenderán y de acuerdo con lo anteriormente expuesto pueden merecer el calificativo de ser la pareja ideal. Relación idónea en los negocios y la amistad.<br>  <br>  Hombre Piscis y Mujer Virgo<br>  Se comprenden espiritualidad y sexualmente, pero tienden a vivir una relación sadomasoquista... El pex desea nadar y mientras lo hace sue?a e idealiza cuanto le rodea. La/El virgen le detiene para se?alar las faltas y pedirle que regrese a la realidad, lo que significa un verdadero insulto para él, que siente que agreden su inteligencia, su sensibilidad pero sobre todo su libertad... Cuando deciden unirse sentimentalmente nace en ambos una relación odio-amor... Sin embargo como amigos llevan una excelente comunicación en la que combianan la sensibilidad con el frío análisis de Virgo, pero con dicha fórmula obtienen magníficos resultados.|`|dO8qanSUaa	Si, ya que es piscis y el alter de piscis es virgo...asi que adelnate y suerte.<br>  Bye!!|`|njA896iiaa	nooo! son completamente incompatibles virgoy picis pero tu sabras si lo intentas suerte!!!!!|`|vySL8mhRaa	Una persona del 3 de marzo es de piscis, signo opuesto a virgo.

Los virgo son más estables.<br>  si ambos logran equilibrar bien sus puntos débiles, son una pareja muy interesante.<br>  Linnett|`|gBvoyeEBaa	Ambos signos son "opuestos". Polos opuestos se atraen eh ???<br>  No lo dudes pero no lo martirices con tu obseción por el orden y tus estructuras.<br>  Piscis necesita de tus caminos para concretar materialmente cosas y virgo necesita la espiritualidad de piscis, su sencibilidad y su afección por la música y el arte.<br>  Agua y tierra...muy bueno, no lo dudes<br>  Saludos<br>  Luis

Al correr del tiempo se fue perfeccionando el arte hasta convertirse en un factor creador de indiscutible belleza.<br>  Hoy la humanidad ha avanzado por el brillante camino de la civilización y ha podido determinar el tipo de persona que se los tira, por el sonido o modulación del PEDO al salir.<br>  Hay PEDOS brillantes, sonoros, soplados, inodoros, alegres y calculados, los hay sin excepción de frió, calor, de largo o corto metraje y los hay fugitivos y voluntarios.<br>  Su modulación tan importante depende de la posicionen que este la persona al tirárselo; si esta parada, el PEDO saldrá con un sonido opaco cavernoso. Si hace el culito hacia fuera, saldrá mas aguado. Si hace flexión completa como si fuera a juntar cinco centavos , entonces el pedo saldrá con un sonido perfecto, resonante y melodioso. Puede lograrse su modulación levantando la pierna hacia atrás.<br>  Si el individuo en vez de dejar libre el transito al PEDO, frunce y junta las nalgas, comete el peor de los delitos, llamémosle PEDICIDIO. Nunca ahogue un PEDO, pues es su mejor amigo. <br>  Un eminente naturalista psicológico (el célebre Doctor Japonés SIPUJA SEKAGA) ha tenido una genial idea; identificar las personas por medio del PEDO.<br>  AVERIGüE SU TIPO Y BúSQUELO EN LA LISTA SIGUIENTE:<br>  INFELIZ: El que se tira un pedo y se surra.<br>  ESTRATéGICO: El que se tira un pedo y lo disimula con tos.<br>  FOTOGéNICO: El que se tira un pedo frente al espejo.<br>  CIENTíFICO: El que embotella los pedos.<br>  FOTOGéNICO: El que se tira un pedo frente al espejo.<br>  CIENTíFICO: El que embotella los pedos.<br>  DE MALA FE: El que se tira un pedo y le echa la culpa al vecino. <br>  ANTISOCIAL: Al que no le gustan los pedos ajenos.<br>  PESIMISTA: El que no se tira un pedo por miedo a surrarse.<br>  MISERABLE: El que no se tira un pedo por no desgastarse el ano.<br>  IMPúDICO: El que se tira un pedo y se surra de risa.<br>  CONCHUDO: El que va a un velorio, se tira un pedo y le echa la culpa al muerto<br>  DADIVOSO: El que no le niega un pedo a nadie.<br>  AMABLE: El que le encantan los pedos de los demás.<br>  MíSTICO: El que se tira un sonoro pedo en misa.<br>  SIN VERGüENZA: El que se tira un pedo en casa y pregunta "Quién esta tocando la puerta?"<br>  Si usted quiere alcanzar la perfección pedorífica deberá en los cuatro días siguientes, de comer repollo, huevos cocidos, frijoles negros y rábanos.|`|ptCyxkMwaa	eso estuvo bastante cruel

They have improved their manufacturing abilities to make them at the same (or better) quality level, but for a lower manufacturing cost.  this results in either lower prices to the consumers, or to no price increases for new models.  <br>  <br>  I recently met part of the Honda R&D group that redesigns the Accord.  I told them how much I love my 2003 Accord EX, and they told me that the 2008 Accords will be another phenominal model (best since the 2003), and will be sold without any price increase.  Bigger car, bigger engine, more luxurious, etc.  <br>  <br>  Honda works on the right things to reduce their overall costs, which gets passed on to us.  The American manufacturers cut quality (cheaper parts from cheaper suppliers), so you pay for it in repairs.<br>  <br>  I've had my 2003 Accord for 3 1/2 years, and just now put any money into it -- breaks, tires, changed transmission fluid, etc.  These cars last forever!

PqJ51l3daa	La domanda è: "se tu fossi nei panni dell'altro, quale mi diresti che è la porta del paradiso?". Ora, supponendo che la porta del paradiso è a destra sorvegliata da quello che dice la verità e la porta dell'inferno è a sinistra con quello delle bugie, facendo alla "guardia"della verità quella domanda, essendo sincero si immedesimerà nei panni del bugiardo e ti dirà che la porta giusta è a sinistra. Se invece la domanda la fai al bugiardo, questo ti dirà sempre e comunque una bugia, perciò ti dirà anche lui di aprire la porta a sinistra. Quindi basterà andare, in entrambi i casi, a destra.

Its so unbelievable how messed up that movie is.<br>  <br>  I consider the Justice League series the best thing to happen to television since... well ever.

Unfortunately, they weren't able to produce enough episodes to fully cover all the ends of the DC universe.<br>  <br>  But we still have Legion of Superheroes.|`|g0SLq7XHaa	Yah dude batman beyond kicked *** it is my favorite batman ever!!!!<br>  do you know where to find episodes on the internet?

Donc deja, M6 a eu la chance de pouvoir diffuser les 10 premiers épisodes de la saison 3. Mais à raison d'un épisode par jour, il est impossible de diffuser ceux qui ne sont pas encore passé au Etats Unis !<br>  <br>  Donc en attendant, m6 diffuse le bidesque "saga nouvelle star" qui ne réunit que 6 % du public (contre 10% pour veronica mars).<br>  <br>  Il ne serait pas étonnant de revoir debarqeur notre chere veronica mars prochainement, de la 1ere saison jusqu'à la 3eme inedite. Donc , faites bien attention lorsque Veronica Mars est rediffusé à surveiller quand les inédits arrivent !!|`|4b11d54eb33b967efcc4eb5c6f40cf01aa	fin de la saison surement|`|77e5b02d0f9c493914d2cb1a4aeedaabaa	je sais pas|`|fee457a3baf02061843c71ebef989cc0aa	C'est la politique M6, qui gère très mal ses programmes.

Du coup, on se dit "c'est une redif", on ne regarde pas forcément régulièrement et on rate les inédits ...|`|xRaGyugTaa	pour elle ne sait pas arrêter hihihihihihihihihi|`|zO2noPRkaa	parce que la fin de la saison 3 est en cours de doublage

Et que comme le cascadeur a échoué il s'est fait tuer et c'est pourquoi le cascadeur qui devait se douter qu'il allait mourir a écrit le nom de véronica sur sa main pour la prévenir... Donc du coup d'après moi il doit avoir un tueur dans la nature qui va essayer de tuer véronica.

Je le regardais aussi quand j'étais gosse. Il y a eu aussi une série de dessins animés.

UbmbPNFLaa	Logan sans hésiter ! Trop mignon quand il est venu la sauver hier !!! Duncan est trop lisse et trop propre sur lui (même s'il a des c?tés sombres). Logan c'est le genre tête à claque irrésistible. Je suis certaine qu'ils vont former un couple explosif avec des ruptures, des réconciliations... Vive Veronica et Logan !!! Et Logan est quand même plus mignon.|`|b5c28d5e0e87e446ce1c4c90d8bac834aa	Je suis une fane inconditionnelle de Logan..

(a un certain moment logan deviendra détestable et ensuite très touchant)<br>  veronica sera toujours là a la rescousse<br>  j'en dis pas plus je te laisse découvrir tout ?a toute seule ?a va etre de mieux en mieux

It still continues to throb the hearts of many.

Sometimes we need to buy music chores and sometimes we get it free from our friends or relatives. Internet is gaining ground everyday in everybody’s life. Life is, slowly, becoming incomplete without Internet. Internet is a rich source of music, ringtones too. It provides music, ringtones; paid and free, both.

VVRanrdBaa	Il y a eu 5 saisons d'Angel, et les producteurs ont décidés d'arrêter la série après cette 5ième saison car ils préfèraient terminer en beauté plut?t que de laisser la série mourir à la tv et de la retirer à cause de cela. (En passant, des gens meurent vraiment dans Buffy/Angel: Tara, Jenny, Joyce, Cordelia, Anya, Doyle...ce n'est pas parce qu'on les revoit en flashback qu'ils sont réssucités...) Et mon émission favorite est How i Met Your Mother, qui met en vedette Alyson Hannigan (Willow dans Buffy).|`|RVr3K5CTaa	Il existe 5 saisons à Angel, qui a survé?u un an à la fin de Buffy permettant de transférer le personnage de Spike de l'un à l'autre (personne ne meurt jamais dans Buffy/Angel)<br>  La série ne s'arrête pas du jour au lendemain, un épisode de fin clot la série d'une manière assez magistrale bien que peu conventionnelle, après une dernière saison en demi-teinte.|`|e195f1f0685948d02f311675e8de10b0aa	la 1 ère question j'on est uncune idée,mon feuilleton prefére c'est Dead Zone sans uncun doute.|`|08jDYegfaa	J'adore Les Sopranos et 24 (chrono)...

fUh5RPnZaa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  Tous les 21 Juin en France, on célèbre l'arrivée de l'été en organisant ( entre autre) la fête de la musique :)<br>  <br>  Beaucoup de musiciens se retrouvent sur des scènes, dans les rues, dans les bars/cafés... et tout le monde chante et danse<br>  <br>  C'est aussi la date de naissance de quelques célébrités dans le monde : Jean-Paul Sartre, Michel Platini, Manu Chao, Fran?oise Sagan, Abdel Halim Hafez, Chirine Ebadi, Prince William...<br>  <br>  PS : Le 21 Mars c'est le 1er jour du printemps (c'est aussi le jour de l'an pour les Iraniens )<br>  <br>  voili voilou :)|`|6R289ckRaa	Le 21 juin c'est le jour de l'été|`|7d514be30b582ebca41ae69d7677a997aa	La Fête de la Musique a lieu à travers le monde le 21 juin (premier jour de l'été de chaque année).<br>  <br>  Elle est imaginée en 1981 par Marcel Landowski, et popularisée par Jack Lang alors ministre de la culture fran?ais. Sa première édition a lieu le 21 juin 1982. C'est l'occasion d'une liesse populaire et la manifestation conna?t un succès croissant au cours des décennies suivantes. Le 21 juin a été choisi car ce jour est le premier jour d'été et aussi le solstice d'été (le jour le plus long de l'année) : cette date symbolise ainsi le sacre de la nature à travers cette journée festive, à l'image des fêtes pa?ennes dédiées à la nature ou aux moissons durant l'Antiquité (fêtes de la Saint-Jean).<br>  <br>  Elle a pour vocation de promouvoir la musique de deux fa?ons. Sous le slogan homophone à son nom, faites de la musique, elle encourage les musiciens amateurs à se produire bénévolement dans les rues. Grace à l'organisation de nombreux concerts gratuits, d'amateurs mais aussi de professionnels, elle permet à un public large d'accéder à des musiques de toutes sortes et origines (musique classique, jazz, rock, world music, musique traditionnelle, etc.).<br>  <br>  La musique étant un vecteur de communication universel, cette fête s'est aujourd'hui complètement internationalisée : en moins de 15 ans, elle s'est diffusée dans 110 pays sur les 5 continents.|`|Ci1mK2TDaa	Le 21 juin ! <br>  ...fête instaurée par Jack Lang<br>  Pour t'en souvenir: c'est le jour où nous passons en été|`|NELPwbWwaa	Le 21 juin bien s?r !<br>  <br>  Je m'en souviens très bien car depuis que Jack Lang a instauré cet évènement, je sais que nous avons juste après 364 jours de tranquillité...<br>  <br>  Et je ne compte pas les années bissextiles !<br>  -|`|RMVVjNd4aa	Date exacte jeudi 21 juin|`|YPxxI4AFaa	21 juin|`|30291753b37bf6cc19aee6016b460d16aa	Le 21 juin|`|23d5e4755b5554630c7417b8e95f0da1aa	21 juin|`|805748daeb99562b3360b6a2d0cf2c26aa	si tu aimes la musique c'est tous les jours !|`|8f567247095980ec6015283c3927d554aa	Le 21 juin comme tous les ans.|`|b6d3761f599712c27b8fc3aebd624897aa	21 juin mon pote!|`|e4c8361415c14178cc141d4898ee5e30aa	Justement en parlant de musique, va découvrir ce nouvel et jeune artiste sur ce blog : il a à peine vingt ans, il vient de sortir son 2ème CD dont il est ( comme le premier ) auteur, compositeur et interprête, il s'appelle Bruce, c'est excellent !<br>  bruce_maccopperfield.musicblog.fr|`|472ab4a6042aa45d8fe7216f665c2efcaa	21 juin<br>  le jour de l'été !!|`|8822a8af03f83ce0354844aae9442304aa	c'est toujours le 21 juin.|`|b2716fa9f6508f312fa3b0cd3aa0893faa	Comme toutes les années c'est le 21 juin. je m'en souviens parce qu'il y a 3 evenements ce jour là: c'est l'été, fete de la musique et l'anniversaire de mon pere.|`|be3b92239f937b886f7c29be4e60eecbaa	Le 21 juin !

C'est une des rares séries où on ne peut pas trouver, au bout d'autant de saisons, une baisse de régime dans aucune saison. Au contraire, elle se bonifie avec le temps.<br>  On pensait avoir atteint un sommet avec le final de la saison 5 (celui de Tarentino où Nick est enfermé dans son cercueil), mais non, ?a continue de plus belle durant la saison 6 et maintenant la 7 (la mort de Sam par exemple ou l'épisode raconté par les morts, ils sont tous bien)<br>  C'est une série qui ne dé?oit pas au fil du temps, contrairement à Miami qui sombre dans le pathétique avec les malheurs d'Horatio.<br>  <br>  La saison 2 de House est encore mieux que la saison 1 avec un double épisode de fin fabuleux. C'est original, le personnage est atypique (comme l'est Grissom, ce qui fait l'intérêt des Experts) au possible mais très attachant. La série est très bien construite. Un must du genre.<br>  <br>  En plus léger, Bones et Grey's anatomy sont très bonnes.<br>  <br>  La saison 3 d'Atlantis est bonne aussi, à ne pas louper.

I don't go to Ybor much but the state museum is in an old bakery bldng,the columbia restaurant is OK but hugely overpriced. the Silver Ring is good for cuban sandwiches but I haven't been ther since they moved..these are Tampa places-I'm assuming most cities have amusement parks,aquariums& generic stuff

Et ma mère, ha ma mère, une princesse en tablier. Et les jours qui fondaient comme ces pains à la vanille, qu'on trempait, tous les trois, dans notre même bol de café. <br>  <br>  Elle était le jardin de son ame, il était la lumière de ses yeux, et miracle des miracles ni le temps ni les obstacles n'ont éteint leurs feux. <br>  <br>  Et comme je plongeais du haut de mes dimanches, dans leur grand lit aux larges vagues blanches, et j'étais bien contre eux et comme il sentait bon le grand berceau des amoureux. Mon père qui rit, ma mère qui se penche pour me chanter sa plus jolie chanson, quel chef d'oeuvre mon enfance, nous étions bénis des dieux, nous étions des gens heureux...<br>  <br>  Elle est belle mon histoire, t'as marché, elle t'a plu, j'ai menti, j'ai triché, voilà la vérité, toute nue.<br>  <br>  Imagine maintenant, toute une enfance sans caresses, une guerre de vingt ans, à coup de gifles et d'avocats. Dans mon ?le, ?a battait. Trois naufragés de la tendresse, trois ratés de l'amour, notre famille c'était ?a.<br>  <br>  Et je fus déporté de collège en h?tels, je n'ai vu que des gares comme décor de No?l. J'attendis vingt ans pour na?tre, accoudé à la fenêtre du calendrier.<br>  <br>  Et mon père et ma mère, mes pauvres aigles qui vieillissent, pansent encore leurs blessures pour mieux pouvoir se déchirer. C'est la haine, comme un sport, avec des larmes en bénéfice, des injures, des factures, le cinéma des divorcés.<br>  <br>  Maintenant c'est fini, plus de larmes, allez viens, on s'en va tous les deux, on défie tous les obstacles, on se paye le miracle d'être un couple heureux.<br>  <br>  Et nous naviguerons du haut de nos dimanches dans un grand lit aux larges vagues blanches, et nous nous aimerons et dormirons tous deux au grand berceau des amoureux,<br>  <br>  C'est aujourd'hui que notre vie commence, elle sera la meilleure de mes chansons.

Géniale les épisodes sont encores plus marrants. J'adore cet humour et les personnages sont tous géniaux.<br>  <br>  Dans la saison 1 je remarque que les autres personnages étaient un peu moins fouillé. je ris un peu moins que dans la 2 (meme si l'épisode ou il crache sur le chrirugien avant d'opérer et à mourir de rire... dans le contexte).|`|UhvMG4jSaa	j'ai jamais pris le temps de regarder )=|`|dk6bxNEyaa	j'adore mais regrette que ca passe si tard je m'endors devant et rate souvent la fin <br>  par contre perso j'aimerai tomber sur un toubib aussi compétent mais pas aussi cynique le moins qu'on puisse dire c qu'il ne prend pas de gants pour t'annoncer une mauvaise nouvelle <br>  enfin un toubi humain avec ses qualités mais aussi ses defauts|`|4q0Ky4iXaa	Moi j'ai regardé un épisode, mais je n'ai pas vraiment aimé.<br>  Maintenant c'est vrai que le peronnage principal est sympas et original...|`|6d45e0748b718d90ff0fab5faab3a83caa	J'aime bien la série et le r?le.<br>  Mais perso, j'aimerais pas l'avoir comme docteur.|`|824d5db6e16aeb2feb3ea8401d53ddfdaa	J'adore|`|9c763284fd6d881f1161276d47532dc2aa	J'adore le c?té cynique du personnage et ses réponses décalées tout en étant souvent pertinentes...Un vrai régal.

0b4b874b9ce8b5a2b74475be7022ac5daa	Bonjour!!<br>  <br>  Bah en fait j'aime surtout le 3) Faire du cata, et en prendre plein la figure...<br>  <br>  Mais souvent ?a débouche sur le 2. Même sans dessaler on fini toujours par prendre un bain.... Et du coup faut sécher au soleil! Puis une fois accosté se prélasser a l'ombre d'un chêne vert sur le bord des dunes, histoire de trouver un peu d'ombre et de savourer tout le sel qui commence a craqueler la peau et a lui donner un si bon gout!<br>  <br>  T'as même pas demandé ce qu'on aimait pas à la plage^^<br>  <br>  -Les chiens qui chient<br>  -les cons qui font des feux et laissent les cadavres de bouteilles qui nous tranchent le pieds qu'on arrive pas a soigner parce qu'on a tout les temps les pieds dans l'eau >.<<br>  (par contre un bon feu de camp maitrisé, et nettoyer au petit matin, c'est trés bon^^ mais gaffe à la marrée quand même XD)<br>  -Se prendre une lame de fond, une déferlante ou tout autre surprise de la mer (c'est un peu fort la mer^^)<br>  -les h?tels qui s'approprient les plages devant leurs usines et qui en interdisent l'entrée >.<<br>  -les décharges qui deversent leur flux de merdouilles sur les plages des landes >.<<br>  -Les bateaux qui dégazent au large les soirs de tempêtes et qui nous obligent à euthanasier des centaines d'oiseaux en centre de soins >.<<br>  -Les plongeurs du dimanche qui nage avec leur harpon la pointe en avant, surtout quand ils te le plantent dans l'épaule (souvenir de corse^^)<br>  -Les Jet Ski qui t'en foutent plein les oreilles de 8 heure du mat a 22h.... Et qui croient que la mer est un circuit sans risque.<br>  -Pour finir... le plus grave.... Avoir du sable dans le maillot de bain >.<<br>  <br>  Voila... désolé, c'est la saison qui veut ?a... fini la tranquillité... L'été arrive mais avec elle une bonne dose de cons....<br>  <br>  Heureusement qu'on est pas tous inconscient!!<br>  <br>  Les autres choses que j'aime à la plage : <br>  <br>  -Courir sur le sable brulant parce que tu peux pas marcher dessus téllement il est chaud XD<br>  -Les poissons même si ils pissent dedans! (des fois je le fais aussi... *ssshhhht*)<br>  -Les couchers de soleil, ou les levers suivant ou on est...<br>  -Avoir du sable entre les orteils (dés qu'on arrive en ville la sensation de manque se fait sentir^^)<br>  -Rester comme un con pendant une heure ou deux a regarder les vagues, ou les pas vagues....<br>  -écouter rouler les galets!<br>  -Regarder les gens se noyer (heu là c'est pas vrai, c'est juste pour vous réveiller^^)<br>  -Marcher sur un oursin.... (là c'est pour ME réveiller^^)<br>  -Passer la nuit au clair de lune après avoir éteint le feu et ramasser le plus gros des ordure avant le fin ménage de demain... ou même pas une capsule trainera à terre^^<br>  -Suivre les bécasseaux sanderlings qui courent avec les vagues... on dirait des tout p'**** surfers qui hésitent a prendre une vague^^ XD<br>  -le bruit des goélands et les cliquetis des mats, les craquement des embarquadères.<br>  <br>  Bref, la mer... Que ?a soit falaises, sable, galet, ou même vasière... Je crois que je pourais pas vivre sans >.<<br>  Mettez moi à Paris Je tiens pas une semaine... Mettez moi à la montagne, je m'y ferai... mais merde, faudrat du temps^^<br>  <br>  Et toi Vinie? tu préfères quoi?|`|11b5fee27d6a483729ed2ba2d966a2eeaa	bronzer|`|4a8ce3bb320042f4fefa1285c6f5f85eaa	je suis de nature bronzé  ( couleur bronzeur )  et quand j'ai  l'occasion d'être à la mer je me mets tout nu pour redorer ma couleur , et  puisque mon passe temps préféré est la pèche , je me trouve souvent sur mon zodiac avec ma canne à pèche , et par la mémé occasion je pique une tète dans l'eau .|`|u87xNsFgaa	les sorties en bateau,,catamaran,,c est geant,,j ai fait les antilles,, de bas en haut,, jusqu a cuba,,un vrai bonheur,, une sensation de liberte, un epanouissement total,,|`|53caa7bcbc84de04a96236b355593570aa	le bateau, j'adore le bateau, filer sur l'eau !|`|KK9q0kynaa	je prefere me baigner car j'adore etre dans l'eau|`|Soq05pZdaa	me dorer au soleil<br>  j'adoooore enfouir mes pieds dans le sable, l'odeur de la crème solaire<br>  <br>  inconvenient : le monde !

It is only, when one can talk to you with his/her instrument, tell you about tears so that you cry<br>  or bring a smile to your face about something in your life, or<br>  you become one with the store being told by the music that is being played.  Then are you a musician!  Then and only then, can you say that, you can play that instrument.<br>  <br>  No one can pick the instrument for you, you have to do that yourself. How should you learn to play if you have not the interest to select your own instrument based on YOUR feelings?|`|AA11921492	guitar or drums, make sure its  a drum set|`|b0c3033edbba47a9ad1c3b33ec3e1a4faa	I always liked playing the piano...<br>  It was simple and fun.|`|e4897d2482cd45ac1c3ff1f0766b342faa	start with a Jews Harp, <br>  work your way up from there...|`|fe604fbd41c4024bdda8165e3550432daa	Clarinet is a good one to start with too. Not to heavy and once you have learned that, it's even easier to try other wind instruments, like the sax, or flute.<br>  <br>  Love the drums too, that is a great starting instrument.<br>  <br>  You just need to make the commitment to learn any instrument; you will find your niche.  <br>  <br>  I also suggest really listening to your music, find out what instrument you really think is cool to learn.  It makes it easier if you really want to learn it.|`|1565c0925eb45cbd3dfb998fe9059370aa	why just one? try different instruments until you find something you love and are good at. ive found a few of them im good at and no matter what people say don't quit your instrument if you get teased- last year we had a guy flute who was awesome and he quit cuz he got teased- that sucked- but just find one your good at and stick to it if its one you love- i suggest either flute, drums, piano or guitar since its all of what i play|`|1e245a65847065a98a203e9b024d5693aa	Before anything else, try to ask yourself the kind of music you loved most, and wanted to accompany. I suggest you choose between guitar or keyboards. why? because you can be a solo performer.|`|2a68286b633cb40a97e6900ed747fca2aa	Most instruments require a fair amout of dedication.  I guess that is one of those questions you need to ask yourself.  What instrument do you want to learn how to play?  When you answer that question, then you will have a drive that will cause you to want to learn to play it. whatever it is...|`|40948a722ff133a751dba013bfbb4f32aa	GUITAR... totally the best instrument ever made|`|94919056dbd2381993965ac48f8fd091aa	Violin, its so pretty or piano because if you do that you can go to drums after a few years.|`|9b848551e25b92d99e9125484dbc79feaa	electric guitar or the drums u can rock out anytime u want|`|bf0e37a6a4e73d161c32c64a9cce00b5aa	Your previous answer is right a trombone is easy to play but real hard to carry around.I would rather have played something smaller.|`|8f29503ab02482b65f5ecba74a78f7ddaa	Play whatever your heart disires.|`|AA12398821	trombone.<br>  very easy.<br>  very fun.<br>  i love it.

Vivement lundi pour savoir la suite !|`|XBJEyHl8aa	c vraiment une série pour les neuneus|`|b1a826a4fafd76d5ba217433c7ca6107aa	C'est possible oui et si Arnaud s'appelait en réalité Arnaud Garcia et avait un lien de parenté avec celui que Franck a tué?<br>  Mais johanna est tellement une tête a claques qu'elle ne l'a pas volée son agression. et puis de toutes fa?ons c'est facile de faire porter le chapeau à Bob et en ce qui le concerne il n'y arien de honteux à vouloir faire faire des trucs pour les clubs et la FM pke ce qu'elle chante Maidi c'est pas terrible, non?<br>  Mais alors cela voudrait dire que les filles du mistral ont un problème alors pke à chaque fois qu'elles sortent avec des mecs elles se font avoir regarde donc Ninon et Samuel<br>  Celui sur lequel je m'interroge par contre c'est Vassago aurait il des pouvoirs magiques?

2088750e2e24db94af84bd0688460755aa	Yup, "Herman's" right.  Contrary to popular belief, no, the Rose and "Sharon" are not dead, nor did they die during the course of the movie. They're still in Alessa's alternate dimension. Elaborating on that point, here's the deal...<br>  <br>  There are three parts of Alessa:<br>  <br>  - Alessa (the original body)<br>  <br>  - Sharon (Alessa's good side)<br>  <br>  - Dark Alessa (Alessa's evil side)<br>  <br>  Sharon and Dark Alessa are basically physical manifestations of the two sides of Alessa - the good side and the evil side. As for how Alessa created these physical manifestations (and the alternate dimensions), it can only be assumed that she possessed some kind of supernatural power (which in addition to the fact that she had no father, would obviously lead everyone associated with the cult to call her a witch). That being the case, this is what happened:<br>  <br>  1) Dark Alessa does not, in fact, take over or possess Sharon. Dark Alessa (the evil side) simply recombines with Sharon (the good side), creating a new and complete "reincarnated" Alessa.<br>  <br>  2) Alessa's pact with her evil counterpart not only ensures that she will help her exact her revenge, but that Alessa, after making herself "whole" again, will also be granted a new life with a better mother: Rose.<br>  <br>  3) And as for the ending:<br>  <br>  Alessa's plan works - she gets her much deserved revenge on the cultists, Dark Alessa and Sharon recombine and create a newly "reborn" Alessa, and she ends up with Rose (who either isn't aware or just doesn't care that this little girl isn't her Sharon anymore) as her new mother. Now with Sharon's memories to work with after reuniting her two halves, Alessa can extend her alternate dimension and create a world just like the one Sharon and Rose lived in, where they can stay forever. In other words, Alessa doesn't want them to leave her alternate dimension and in her eyes, for good reason. The real world is where Alessa was hurt, abused and humiliated. In the real world, she felt unsafe, unloved and that the people are untrustworthy (especially men, considering that the absence of her father - assuming he even existed - was the source of her torment, in addition to her horrific experience with the school janitor). Alessa wants to live out the rest of her new life with her new loving mommy in her alternate dimension, where she's in control and she feels safe. However, this is also how Dahlia's warning to Rose, "Be careful what you choose," comes to pass. Unfortunately for Rose, this end result means that she is essentially trapped in Alessa's alternate dimension indefinitely.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  :)|`|qNvPOWymaa	They are still alive but trapped in the world of Silent Hill, a dimension created by Alessa to punish the cult that burned her, and which she dragged Rose and her daughter in to.<br>  <br>  The game explains it, which the movie does not do so well. They are not dead.|`|77e8f9f08896c64a7ad25d70338f90f4aa	i'd say that once they entered the town,the town basically held them back so they can't go to the present.|`|AA10576750	They died in the car accident when they swerved to miss the girl. Basically for most of the movie they were both dead. The people in the church were all dead too. Silent Hill is basically a form of purgatory. Thats why when she called her husband the he couldn't hear her very well.Theres a second Silent Hill movie coming out next year too. Its gonna rock!|`|SXJTZP5zaa	Ok, they did die, then once they were dead their souls could go back home, cause it was over, so they did.

Tous les bons ingrédients pour faire une bonne série y sont : humour, rebondissements, suspense, tout ce qu'il faut, quoi. Le générique de la saison 1 vaut vraiment le détour et pour la saison 2, c'est toujours la même chanson, mais chantée différemment à chaque épisode, c'est un vrai plaisir à chaque fois !<br>  Je ne t'en dis pas plus pour ne pas gacher ton plaisir mais sache que j'adore toutes les séries que tu as citées et je pense que tu aimeras celle-là.<br>  Et aussi, comme dans une réponse ci-dessus, je te conseille Oz, sur l'univers carcéral aux EU. La série est déjà finie depuis longtemps (comme Six Feet Under) mais elle est vraiment géniale (comme Six Feet Under encore une fois).

Par contre à aucun moment dans les pubs l'ociloscope dépassait les sons les plus fort des émission, au même niveau, mais toujours au niveau le plus haut.<br>  <br>  Je pense que pour les annonceux publicitaire la télécommande fus la pire invention, lorsqu'il fallais se lever pour voir changer de chaines les gens regardaient surement plus les pubs.|`|f768ee9dd3b7a63fa05c0a49ebc423ddaa	Tu a raison cela devrait être au même niveau sonore !|`|37a01aa57212013c511d3f02648352aeaa	pour te réveiller, attirer ton attention.<br>  Inconsciemment en baissant le volume t'as porté un certaine intérêt à la publicité, donc ils ont gagné !<br>  Moi je zappe ou je laisse tant pis, on a pas l'choix !|`|3Sr7CJjRaa	pour tenter de te vendre encore plus de camelote|`|7ZuYoofJaa	c'est pour nous avertir de changer de chaine|`|8df582cba10f24d0725c6a7d9ba96d9baa	C'est en fait la même chose qu'un message subliminal : pour que la pub s'imprime mieux dans ton cerveau.

Avec une pub, tu arrives très bien à imaginer de quoi il sagit, tu arrives à suivre sans même voir les images, c'est comme pour la radio, mais quand c'est un programme tv, feuilleton, jeux... il est préférable être devant l'écran pour mieux comprendre, voilà...|`|b9503872458faa27bbc122ed5b40fa5eaa	Coucou,<br>  <br>  Pour qu'on entende des wc!<br>  En fait, c'est censé être formellement interdit.

3qDOBR1waa	Music can add to the emotions of a film.  Generally a score is used to heighten the dominant emotion that the scene is conveying In Spielberg's films  often use John Williams' music to heighten the feeling of sadness the film conveys.  I doubt Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for A Dream would be as powerful without the score.<br>  <br>  Although directors can use music to convey the emotion they want by using music that fits the mood.  Some are able to heighten the emotion of the scene by using music that is opposite what the emotions of the scene call for.  Stanley Kubrick was a master of this. In his film A Clockwork Orange he has the main character sing "Singin' in the Rain" while preforming a violent rape.  This song shows the main character's joy while committing this horrendous act of violence.  The extreme difference between the happy song and brutal action makes the action seem much worse.  Another example of this occurs in his film Full Metal Jacket, at the end of the film the soldiers march off after killing some Viet Cong soldiers while the Mickey Mouse club song is playing.   Suggesting a childlike sense of play for soldiers who are killing people.<br>  <br>  However there are powerful films that don't use scores to heighten emotions.  In Alain Resnais' film Hiroshima Mon Amour, the main character is a French woman staying in Hiroshima.  She is telling the tail of the German soldier she loved during the occupation, as she tells the story there isn't any sound effects and score.  The director just focuses on her memories and narration.  This scene just focuses on her emotions with out sentimentalizing them.  Additionally it puts the viewer into the main character's psyche, since she is so focused on her memories she blocks everything else out.  If there had been a piece of music in that scene the effect would be lost.|`|Tg7QN99Waa	I think it really helps lead you to where the film makers want to take you.|`|AA11581131	Yes, I quite agree! - music IS very important. George Lucas spent time and money on the best music because of it's impact. <br>  Memories of Mothra and Godzillia theme music bring many sences back clearly to mind, years later. <br>  (I'm not big on crying, tearful movies.)<br>  All monster movies have music, builds suspence. <br>  Also used in comedies.|`|Cd5avmhWaa	I agree, I think that the music in the background definately helps make the movie, it's way better with it.

Oui, c'est clair que pour l'enrichissement personnel, ca vaut le détour, le tout c'est d'être en bonne condition physique et psychologique|`|XIR2rPGTaa	non ni à aucune autre émission de télé-réalité.

J'me marre!|`|aab65a7ae08a0c730019f96ddf743557aa	j'adore cette émission mais je ne pense pas que les candidats profitent énormément la découverte de notre culture, c'est toujours la course.<br>  Donc non, autant oarti soi même et visiter que faire la course|`|c2sOJUE8aa	tu sais tu peux le faire tout seul ce trip, tu pars en Chine avec trois francs six sous ;))|`|8082679102e671b0f0ae60511e1c8e78aa	non absolument pas j'ai besoin d'un minimum de confort|`|t3OWxn7faa	certainement pas.<br>  ce n'est pas comme ?a que je con?ois la découverte d'un pays. certains pensent beaucoup à la compétition, à la victoire et se moquent complètement des gens, sont même parfois carrément méprisants. je trouve ?a lamentable|`|8b844b702a1517d664e1689d0b6830aaaa	oui beaucoup c'est le genre d'émissions auxquelles j'aimerais participer (il y en a peu).....sans doute mon c?té voyageur-routard et mon plaisir de découvrir de nouveaux pays et cultures<br>  Je ne connais de la Chine que Pekin|`|4cb4f2d36c83922998c45086c7b39917aa	carrément, j'adore, je pense que ?à peut-etre une expérience énorme, riche en rencontre et en émotions meme si épuisant physiquement! <br>  une véritable introspection: en faisant ce voyage je crois qu'on apprend énormément de chose sur soi!

AA10598858	Don't tell her quietly. If you are really positive that she cannot sing, and you don't want her to embarrass herself, you NEED to tell her. Possibly, as immediately as you can. Thats' very friendly that you would think of your friend and her embarrassing herself. I, myself, would just let my friend embarrass herself and laugh. But that's how cruel and mean I am.|`|41Msm6M1aa	Tell her to go out for "American Idol" It seems to be a magnet for pple who can't sing who think they can. She'll learn the hard way but atleast the criticism won't be from your mouth. Just Kidding.|`|AA10989788	How about you suggest that you and her hold a practice session together before the show.  When she asks how she's doing, say something along the lines of, "Let's practice some more, I want you to wow everyone!"

Une belle recette et le succès forcément au RDV.<br>  <br>  Mais indépendamment des artifices marketing du succès, Charmed a su développer une approche originale d'un thème fantastique : les sorcières. Tout au long des saisons, les auteurs ont su développer une mythologie propre à la série et cohérente. Sorcières, pouvoir supérieur du bien, démons, êtres intermédiaires (non humains mais non démoniaques) etc, le tout dans un monde organisé, avec une histoire logique.<br>  <br>  Charmed a su faire un peu comme Buffy (sans être aussi abouti que Buffy/Angel) : les gamines regardent ?a comme ils regardent un soap (ne s'interessant qu'aux histoires d'amour, s'amourachant des personnages sans comprendre le coté fantastique), et les fans de fantastiques ont pu trouver leur compte avec un CharmedVerse assez complet, cohérent et original.|`|c86cb536041e307514081e03b00133c8aa	fan mais surtout fan de Shannen Doherty (Prudence Halliwel) et Alyssa Milano (Phoebe Halliwel).<br>  j'adore l'actrice Shannen, mais j'ai remarqué qu'elle ne restait jamais lontemps dans les séries même qd les séries sont au top.|`|1c9296e6faf3b8c9383350294700bb70aa	pheobe elle fascine vraiment c'est ma prefere|`|45a409fe0dbd93ac3c87f2d6b9a3d4a6aa	j'aime cette série, et je regarde même si c'est des redifusions !!!!!<br>  febe !!!!!!<br>  mais désolé pour l'horthographe !!!!!|`|b5c28d5e0e87e446ce1c4c90d8bac834aa	personnellement, ma préférée c'était Phoebe.. elle était mignonne, intelligente et c'était une des plus humaines des trois (avec toutes ses histoires d'amour ratées!)|`|xRaGyugTaa	j'adore cette série et j'adore phoebe elle est trop belle et puis j adore son pouvoir j'aurai aimer avoir son don de pouvoir savoir ce que pense les gens c'est trop coooooooollllllllllll
VJ8vFfpeaa	Técnicamente, la película fue hecha con bastante provecho. La fotografía, las actuaciones, el guión, dirección y producción  son satisfacientes.<br>  <br>  En cuando al argumento, es un tema bastante escabroso, pero que, viéndolo de una manera objetiva, puede llegar a suceder. La humanidad está cayendo al abismo y el tema de la peli es sólo una de las miles de posibilidades latentes para nuestro futuro.<br>  <br>  Un mundo no tan lejano, lleno de mezquindad, sordidez, violencia, maltrato y guerra, nos hace pensar.<br>  <br>  Las películas no son sólo para entretener, ya que hay muchas que nos muestran realidades que -en un buen entendimiento por parte del espectador- nos hacen reflexionar. Por eso creo que "Children of man" es una magnífica película.|`|1fa0ae22a2392abcda44a19bb1bda5fcaa	holas, el argumento de la pela da mucho q pensar. Es un futuro al q posiblemente llegaremos si seguimos con la destrucción de nosotros mismos. La fotografía es excelente, los claroscuros del director dan ese toque de frialdad y misterio q envuelve a la película. El final muy fuera de lo común que lo hace muy interesante, un final metafórico.|`|3fTzxeuFaa	es del tipo de películas que hay que analizar porque tiene distintos mensajes. una historia futurista, guerra, conflictos, racismo, supervivencia, hambre, como los constantes abortos cambiaron el curso de los genes de las personas al punto de que nadie podía concebir.... una buena película.|`|940826e7e59c09efdac14b885186202caa	Un super churro.... sin guion y sin chiste... sin nada interesante, ...   es perder el tiempo ver esa pelicula...|`|fde24668f9670c25fe1adb8dff3b5f7daa	muy buena<br>  a mi me gusto|`|4HDivDKyaa	me parece una magnifica fotografia y la historia es bueno pero  la verdad no es un a de mis<br>   favoritas|`|546eb02d1dd7ed293244cc8b9fe55969aa	Hola. La verdad que me encantó la idea de la película, me parece que con esa trama se puede hacer un muy buen guión.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, eso no se vio reflejado en la película que hicieron. En mi opinión, no supieron aprovechar esa buena idea. <br>  <br>  Mi sensación fue como estar esperando que "pase algo" y no pasaba nada, no me atrapó y eso también se reflejó en lo que fue el final del film que fue más que tonto. <br>  <br>  Fui muy entusiasmada a verla, pero me desilucioné y no la recomiendo.|`|8sWvwwjJaa	A mi me parecí una buena historia, en lo personal me dejo muy satisfecha, es una de las que ha valido la pena ultimamente, ya que estan sacando cada peli, pero en fin; yo si la recomendé mucho, a fin de cuentas no esta tan alejada de la realidad en este mundo en el que cada día nos degradamos mas y mas.|`|PUfslrdnaa	No la he visto.|`|TOhdRTEeaa	no me gusto, mala trama, buena historia, mal uso de ella
U7mJNlgnaa	Well, it really depends on what she likes and how much work she wants to put into the costume; but here are a few quick ideas.<br>  ----------<br>  <br>  You could find a school girl uniform for her at just about any costume shop and maybe even at Goodwill or some other thrift shop. It's a good all purpose anime-girl costume. You can also get kimonos at costume shops. Hot Topic and similar gothic themed stores are also good for finding costumes. <br>  <br>  Kanzaki Hitomi from Escaflowne:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/8264/hitomi39.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/82...</a><br>  <br>  Fu from Samurai Champloo:<br>  <a href="http://www.discountanimedvd.com/dvd_images/21703.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.discountanimedvd.com/dvd_imag...</a><br>  <br>  Kamiya Kaoru from Rurouni Kenshin:<br>  <a href="http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~emhale/Kaoruinkimono.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~emhale/Kaoruin...</a><br>  <br>  Komagata Yumi from Rurouni Kenshin:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/komagata_yumi_chan/image/c26.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/komagata_yumi_c...</a><br>  <br>  Elegant Gothic Lolita (not anime specific):<br>  <a href="http://www.morbidoutlook.com/fashion/articles/2002_07_gothiclolita.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.morbidoutlook.com/fashion/art...</a><br>  <br>  Elena from Final Fantasy VII:<br>  <a href="http://ic3.deviantart.com/fs7/i/2005/229/5/5/FFVII_Turks_Tseng_and_Elena_by_BlueRecluse.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ic3.deviantart.com/fs7/i/2005/229...</a><br>  --------------<br>  <br>  Here's a cosplay site where you can get more ideas:<br>  <a href="http://images.cosplay.com/" rel="nofollow">http://images.cosplay.com/</a><br>  <br>  And don't let your friend be limited by her actual physcial appearence; there are all kinds of wigs, masks, and makeup that available at costume shops if she wants/needs to tweak her look some. She can even dress as a male character if she wants to.|`|LHQ5RKMGaa	I think it depends more on who she likes most, since that's what you (and her) would want to spend your money on.<br>  <br>  I have been to a convention before (and it rocks), and I can tell you from experience that it DOES NOT MATTER what color hair you have, or eyes. It's called hair dye. :P<br>  <br>  It may take time and effort, but you can totally transform yourself into someone you're not (like... an anime character). Or buy a wig. That works too.<br>  <br>  I don't find myself resembling anybody in the anime/manga world, and I have the same traits as your friend. But if I wanted to be... Tayuya, or someone, then I would dye my hair, and probably sew a costume together. Or go online and order certain trademark items from cosplaying websites. It can take some cash.<br>  <br>  If you want to make an outfit, then go to a fabric store (like JoAnn's, or Wal-Mart), and search for pattern packets. Look for a clothing piece that MOSTLY RESEMBLES the clothing you want to make. Be prepared to sew, and get help if you need it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I don't really have any websites, or anything. Search around. Dogpile. Google. Anything you want, but make sure to keep an open mind. Spending $300 on some random outfit that you don't even want to wear when the time comes is NOT a good idea. <br>  <br>  Have fun! (try the Ramuné soda, it's delicious!)

La solución está o en que hagas horarios para que tus hijos vean la tele o hables con ellos para explicarles las cosas, no dejes que la televisión sea una guia de sus valores, tu tienes que serlo. Si le cambias de canal cuando pasan los anuncios lo único que vas a lograr es que les de mas morbo verlos, de cualquier forma no puedes comntrolar sus platicas cuando estan lejos de ti o sus pensamientos; mejor habla claramente con ellos|`|e5ae7f5ab52bdb3be8ccbed2eabc33feaa	mira....no se de donde sos...pero en Buenos Aires los chicos pueden ver sexo en cualquier calle....no creo q les produzca alguna reaccion verlo en tv asi....tan ficticio....cuando lo ven en todo horario..... sean parejita, violaciones o depravados masturbandose en los colectivos|`|2WVLKSMPaa	Mira en una ocacion me toco estar en unas conferencias donde estaban esos se?ores de los medios de comunicacion, claro que directamente pregunte lo mismo que tu, y sabes su respuesta cambiele, nosotros no somos responsables de lo que ven sus hijos si no usted, y aseguraron que su programacion sigue un orden y es en horario donde los menores ya debe estar dormidos, de igual manera el anuncio de bebidas alcoholicas los domingos es en horario deportivo asi que es responsabilidad de los adultos que permitimos que nuestros hijos vean esos comerciales.<br>  asi que legislacion olvidalo, aqui no aplica, porque ese es el negocio de ellos.|`|34e8bee156d5a249cc4280e49dd2d522aa	Las quejas se deben hacer al Ente Regulador de Los Medios, si es que estas en Argentina.<br>  saluditos|`|qRmztwdlaa	asi es los comerciales de axe, de condones de m force son muy explicitos, luego porque tanto embarazo en ni?as de poca edad, si no hay cultura en las mendigas televisoras al menos en mexico y si tu vez los ni?os se duermen a las 10 u 11 y a esas horas ya estan peor de degenerados los de las televisoras, les interesa el dinero el publico jamas! lo que debes hacer es mejor buscarle actividades que alejen a tus hijos de la television y las computadoras! hay cosas mejores|`|2fd112d8e1176b1b53a146bf00d0c769aa	Ijole, se a lo que te refieres, aqui en México es parecido, las novelas con contenido de adultos pasa en horario adulto, pero la propaganda, en la que precisamente pasan esas escenas las ponen a cualquier hora!, y como madre es mortificante... no es que una sea mocha, pero hay edades en la que los ni?os deben estar alejados de eso, por lo menos hasta que puedan entenderlo!...<br>  <br>  Creo, que no hay mucho que haces, hablamos de televisoras que requieren dinero y se mueven por ahí, y como dicen, lo más fácil sería que estes atenta y le cambies al canal...<br>  <br>  Otra sería que escribieras un mail o carta a la televisora con copia a algún medio impreso haciendo pública tu preocupación de que pasen propaganda no apta en horarios no aptos para ni?os, de esa manera quedará registrado ante la televisora y ante la opinion pública (por medio del medio impreso)y tal vez pueda hacerse algo... tal vez... =/<br>  <br>  En fin, es solo una idea... saludos|`|Otdh4dJxaa	deverian ser mas lucrativos ya casi ponen a adan y eva en el comercial de decisiones!! y si esto pasa! entonces si!  la gente entonces reclamaria  y quiza talves puedan cambiar el comercial por otro de menor  riesgo!! pero dejame decirte  todas las televisoras de cualquier pais se basan en "reiting" o cualquiera que sea la palabra? si la gente quiere sexo la televisora pone sexo es algo torpe pero ellos tienen que ganar dinero...asi que morbosos y nacos a seguir mirando tv

It's going to be a sci-fi thriller taking place in the future, which will give Hilary a serious role far from the comedy that you and I as we know it. As for the movie's rating....uhmmm....I don't predict movie ratings for upcoming movies, so I'm going to say that "Talking With Dog" is, as of now, not yet rated.|`|OOiuBMnVaa	i am sure it is rated "R".

gV7aZbgvaa	"Storm Cloud Cantata"<br>  Written by Arthur Benjamin and D.B. Wyndham-Lewis<br>  Performed by London Symphony Orchestra<br>  Conducted by Bernard Herrmann|`|gHMoVoFZaa	"Storm Cloud Cantata"<br>  Written by Arthur Benjamin and D.B. Wyndham-Lewis<br>  Performed by London Symphony Orchestra|`|Eoa2nVY0aa	"Benjamin had composed a dramatic Storm Clouds Cantata for a tension-filled scene in the Royal Albert Hall during which the heroine of the film must stop an assassin from shooting a visiting foreign statesman.  The assassin has memorized the music by listening to a recording and waits patiently for the thunderous climax of cymbals which will muffle the sound of his gun.  But the heroine, in desperation, screams just at the moment when the cymbals crash.  The prime minister is distracted by her scream and the assassin’s bullet only wounds him." <br>  <br>  I think these two guys are right, there really is a cymbal crash and orchestral section in the cantata, even if that is not the traditional nature of a cantata. IMDB, a Hitchcock fan site, all sorts of sites confirm that the cantata is the 'finale' piece.

LYRICS<br>  <br>  "Where Did Your Heart Go?"<br>  <br>  I spend my nights down on the wharf<br>  In unlit alleyways<br>  By the church downtown<br>  Where Sally prays<br>  Come down sometime<br>  We'll share a rusty can of corn...<br>  And listen to the radio<br>  I love you, I love you, it says...<br>  <br>  [CHORUS:]<br>  Where did your heart go<br>  Did you put it on a train<br>  Did you leave it in the rain<br>  Or down in Mexico<br>  <br>  You cry, but I don't know<br>  I've heard it all before<br>  There it goes again, the slamming of the door<br>  Sometimes the river calls me<br>  And at night it calls my name<br>  Says "put your troubles down beside me"<br>  Things have always been the same...<br>  And rock 'n' roll won't teach me<br>  What the river said that night<br>  I jumped into this beauty<br>  And drifted out of sight...<br>  <br>  [CHORUS]

What makes enemies?  Pick a reason, any reason.  I think we'll make it to 3000 and beyond but the wars won't stop...ever.  We'll manage to keep from destroying the population but until a bigger threat shows up (the Klingons or some other race from another planet) we will continue to fight and kill each other.|`|PheMWa54aa	world wars won't happen as long as we all don't lose our minds and forget humanity.but with so many terrorists and their inhuman actions taking place,we can't be sure.religion is gaining importance even in terrorism and pollitics,so we have a reason to worry.<br>  and i think humans can make it to the year 3000,why not?<br>  nothing is impossible,right??<br>  maybe we will evolve with some different characteristics,both physically and mentally,but humans will exist!!! :)|`|N5r5AU0yaa	YEs.

My version goes:<br>  <br>  (1) Were you there when they crucified my Lord...<br>  <br>  (2) Were you there when they nailed him to the tree...<br>  <br>  (3) Were you there when they laid him in the tomb...<br>  <br>  (4) Were you there when he rose to live again...

YaerqW3xaa	That's great and all, but who would expect MTV to make a Beatles video game? <br>  <br>  We'll just have to wait, and see |`|C7YbYUYPaa	Well, like all of these video games, there is one positive in the whole thing.  The reality is, young kids are the majoirty of video game players, and if it takes a video game to expose the younger generation to Beatles music, then so be it.<br>  <br>  As long as it is done tastefully, I think it will be ok.  Then again, there are a lot of fans who are more devoted to the Beales than I am, so I'm curious to see what they think.|`|hZegT1raaa	i would ordinarily say that this is just a travesty and that they will destroy the band's music, but considering the people that are working on the game i will give it a chance at potential success|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Since Paul, Ringo, and George & John's wives are collaborating on it I guess I'm going to have to trust their judgement.<br>  After seeing so many other music artist's sell out to the corporate world it doesn't surprise me at all.<br>  The one good thing is that their music will be introduced to people that might never have heard it otherwise!<br>  I do love video games too.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	NOoooooooooooooooo!! This is coming from the station that brought us Bevis and Butthead, Sleezy dating shows, pathetic 'real life' drama tv shows, TRL, 3 minutes worth of actual videos daily, ridiculously immature and lewd cartoons, a show called "jackass", and a slew of terrible low rate films.<br>  <br>  They will RUIN the Beatles legacy.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I guess I won't be adding any real insights here, but I pretty much echo the sentiments of Beatle Fanatic. I enjoy these guitar hero type games anyways, I love the Beatles, and this has been done with the public blessings of everyone whose legacy is at stake. I'm for it. Plus, like many have said, more people have more reasons to listen to the Beatles now. Gotta like that.|`|AA11039335	I think, it's incredibly retarded. Made because they know Beatles fans will buy anything with the band name on it. Yeah, looks pretty awful. |`|4LH9RXtuaa	Saddened - but, it's MTV, the immortal destroyer of music. I think the only good thing that ever came from MTV is the "Unplugged" series (the older ones - when they were actually a music channel).|`|69feb1c38fe2bb2c557c2ca3af25447caa	I'm a complete sucker for anything Beatles related and already know that come Holiday 09, that will be under my tree.. From me, or someone else..|`|qTrxgerBaa	sounds like fun?<br>  <br>  lol beatles rockband ...wait the beatles are a pop band so shouldnt it be a the beatles popband?|`|jyPCm1evaa	Like said before, exposing Beatles music to people would be good.<br>  <br>  But from MTV? Two words: Oh, no.|`|AgQForcYaa	Hmmm....<br>  <br>  Do not know if want....<br>  <br>  But will probably buy anyway. |`|3adf34a77d61d407aad0b9e439793108aa	they have done enough damage since the mid 1980s|`|Pwdh9lDDaa	I agree with Happiness Is A Warm Gun|`|njIIixmcaa	i have no clue how that is gonna turn out|`|64qRgtrBaa	Well, it seems that Paul, Ringo, Yoko and Olivia have all been involved with the creative process, so it probably won't be a complete waste. And it'd be nice to see a younger generation introduced to the brilliance of The Beatles the way the Guitar Hero games introduced classic rock to them. I'm surprised that MTV is making it though, as if they know d*ck about the Beatles, or any music of good taste for that matter.|`|tbYncGouaa	I feel like this is where gaming companies should reach for ideas in the Rock Band and Guitar Hero games. I mean it's great for sales, people buy these like hotcakes. But just think on how huge it would be if they made it on bands that were already solid in being famous for great music. The Beatles are a perfect example of this because I know i would and a lot of other people would love to play through the Beatles catalog with friends and family. This olden music is going to bring people together becuase it's got a much larger fan base then most bands that they put in them already, considering they're new and only reach for a certain age demographic. But the Beatles has a long reach in the age demographic. Ranging from people my age (18) to adults, some little kids, and some elders. If these people can grasp a firm grip onto these plastic controllers then you got yourself a good time. <br>  <br>  I know if they make Rock Band: Beatles Addition I'd definitely put the green down for that. If this goes well i would expect them to make a Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, ETC ETC. This could breathe more life into an already popular series. |`|33mNRNzCaa	im torn.i love guitar hero but iv ben a classic rock fan long before i heard of GH and im tired of my friends saying they love Alice Cooper when all they know is Schools Out, but one of my earliest memories is my dad playing I Want to Hold Your Hand and i love the Beatles|`|XMxrkun5aa	whatttt?<br>  <br>  ughh. i mean, yeah i'll buy it. because i can't pass up something dealing with the beatles. <br>  <br>  but does mtv have to ruin everything that's beautiful and turn it to conformist mush? is that their personal goal?|`|snyRxsoIaa	Only if they keep it real and don't try to modernize the Beatles or their style of music then cool.No physco Beatles......Blessings of Sweets Treats.......|`|x18w912Xaa	can I get a HELL YEAH? lol SWEET|`|Cclr5Z3paa	sounds boring, honestly.|`|MVOeApxSaa	Say WHAT now?

Phenomenal. <br>  Killer Rock and Roll outfit with 2 great singer/songwriters. <br>  Screwed over by MTV and being pushed into playing up sexy images, The girls got lambasted for Ann's weight gain.  How can one's appearance have any effect on her vocal performance is beyond me, but some would claim that it's not too much to ask that she stay thin.<br>  Either way, this band was pure rock.<br>  I am pretty sure they still do small tours now, and that they are having fun doing it.  I am sure the audience is having a great time as well.|`|8be96da2ae739749ab803e1abbc1c224aa	Ann & Nancy Wilson....Great singing sisters!<br>  Love all their songs.

gDxMoBl9aa	Argh!!!!<br>  <br>  Wow this is tough, gimmie a minute to think here..<br>  <br>  Can't erase the 2,000's cause I love too many new Bands<br>  I would NEVER consider erasing the 60's, 70's or 80's<br>  <br>  That leaves the 50's and the 90's...Hmmmmm<br>  <br>  Well if I erase the 90's I'd lose AIC, The Four Horsemen, and Faith No More, so that won't do.<br>  <br>  Goodbye 1950's then I rekon. No great loss (To Me at least) with Elvis and all. In My opinion sure it might be the birth of all Rock and Roll but compared to what came after it's all unbearably weak and boresome...<br>  <br>  I'm gonna get bombed, lol.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  The early and Mid 80's were one of the most unique and revolutionary Eras in all Music. Anyone that doesn't recognize that doesn't know beans from applebutter.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  Anyone that's not finding Great Music from the 2000's..isn't looking hard enough. When I first came here to R&P I felt the same way as many of these answerers, but the Music is out there, believe Me, look and Ye shall find.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Well.... I'd say the 50s because I really don't like that music much, but I realize it laid the groundwork for what was to come.... the 60s & 70s ~ also pivotal years. The 90s up to now has been fairly interesting, so I guess that leaves the 80s. And I may be prejudiced because I sorta missed out on a lot of the 80s music scene...|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	the 2000s, I like music from all the other decades and I can live without the music of this one, it's just not that good!|`|cUjcn2lsaa	The 2000s...........I like very few bands that were formed in this decade.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	I would have to go with the 2000's (and it might have something to do with the fact that I mainly listen to country music now)...DEFINITELY not the 60's, 70's, or 80's!  Those were all classic rock decades in their own right with incredible music geniuses.<br>  <br>  I personally, however, dislike the 50's era "rock and roll" music.  But you can't erase that decade because that was when it all began.|`|fzqMOD4Waa	1990s. I would miss quite a few bands, mostly of the Brit-Pop era, and a few great albums would die, but it would be less of a loss to me personally than others.<br>  <br>  And it would put an end to the boy band problem.|`|hZegT1raaa	i would throw the 2000s out...the only relatively new bands i can think of that i truly enjoy listening to are coldplay and airbourne, and compared to the rest of the decades the volume of good music is just too small|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	I would erase nothing.<br>  It all sums up. Taking any factor out of the equation alters the result.<br>  <br>  Like deleting some years of your own life......good or bad it made you who you are.|`|komayN73aa	id erase anyone who wants to erase any decade of music for being as ignorant as they are|`|McN2I1E6aa	1840 - 1850<br>  <br>  Alot of import music from the west indies and asia minor came to America.  Not a good time for music!|`|EQP8VZwiaa	That's impossible to answer. Where would the influences for new music come from?|`|C7YbYUYPaa	2000's for sure.  This new stuff is all terrible if you ask me.|`|kdVxvMXSaa	2000's.  If you erase the 50's, nothing would be built upon that for the 60's, same goes for subsequent decades.  <br>  <br>  And I will stand by the fact that I have yet to hear anything earth-shatteringly good in this decade.  Decent, mediocre?  Yeah, but nothing truly ground breaking that has captured my attention.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Getting rid of the 90's does little for the boy band phenomenon.  NKOTB or New Edition anyone?|`|wEt9UEB7aa	Normally I would say the '00s, but that erases my favorite band, Dream Theater...DEFINITELY not the '60s or '70s, probably not the '80s, too much good stuff from there...the '90s had some good Michael Jackson Stuff...the '50s had Chuck Berry...so I would go for the '10s. Who's ever heard music from the '10s anyway?|`|ebBfz2zhaa	Well Def Not the 80s then there would be no GNR and no the 2000s then there would be no velvet revolver. Not the 70s or 60s no led zep pink floyd etc. NO the 90s coz of nirvana pearl jam etc. So bye bye 50s no big loss to me|`|69feb1c38fe2bb2c557c2ca3af25447caa	No decades can be erased...<br>  <br>  The good in every decade still outweighs the bad 2-1...<br>  <br>  I guess the only option would be to delete certain bands from certain decades and leave the rest alone..|`|2YHJZwksaa	I'm joining the party and taking out the 50's <br>  <br>  Although I wonder by doing this and all the bands that were influenced by many of the pioneers of rock where would that leave us today ??|`|wlmNqGyjaa	I say 2000's nothing amazing, also most the bands i like were back in the 90s too. |`|PsFGx8Bxaa	now<br>  because bands like the Jonas Brothers are considered rock|`|JLvc2RMraa	2000's, because I have not heard anything that I really like in this decade.

There really hasn't been anything new.  Everything that's come out in the last few years has just been responses and variations on the music that has come before.

C7YbYUYPaa	I am pro gun, but it has a lot to do with my upbringing.<br>  <br>  My family has always had guns, and they have always been used appropriately.  I grew up in a hunting family, and my dad was the same way.  I was taught to treat the gun with respect and always use the most extreme caution.  Guns, to me, are not simply terrible, killing machines.  They are, in fact, useful tools for not only survival, but also for your own defense.<br>  <br>  I think the biggest problem this country in particular has, is that these people own guns, and have no fear of them.  I was taught to fear the gun, because if you don't, it will hurt you, or someone else.  <br>  <br>  You can't get rid of guns just because the wrong people are able to get their hands on them.  For every hood and thug that gets his hands on a gun for robbery or murder, you have an outdoorsman using that gun to provide for his family or a trapshooter.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I guess you could say I'm kind of in the middle when it comes to this subject. I do think people should be able to own guns and in no way do I think people who own guns should have there guns taken away.<br>  <br>  But, I really would love to see laws about getting guns way stronger than they are. With every serial killer you see, you always hear the same thing about him being able to get a gun easily. Think about the Virginia Tech killings, that kid didn't have to go illegally or to some complicated scheme to get a gun. They pretty much gave it right to him.|`|6D4a6PoVaa	Damn...articulation is not my thing.  I'll just take a line from Dilbert.<br>  <br>  Everyone should have guns.  Bazookas, AK47s, the works.  I believe, however, that only I should have ammunition.|`|GhI9wYUiaa	guns are useful for hunting. but nobody hunts with a 9mm. i think that people should be raised not to shoot people, rather than reforming all the gunr egulation things.|`|LkN5nr6faa	There is a reason my middle name is "Uncle Ted"<br>  <br>  =P|`|3g3SCnDDaa	While I would never own a gun in my lifetime, I respect the rights that are set down by the second amendment. I personally would not be able to bear owning a gun, (for some reason it strikes me as crude and unnecessary). However, all but a couple of my father's brothers own some kind of gun, and they happen to be responsible with its use. So if anything I believe people should be allowed to own a weapon, however, I shudder to think that there are people that carry their guns with them in public, that's just a mistake waiting to happen in my opinion. Again, I would never own a gun. People say that if someone were to break into your home, what could you do without a fire arm? First, people have been sued by burglars (yes, you read right), for having been shot while they were intruding upon someones house, and have won! Now, this isn't something that always happens, obviously, but I'm never taking that risk. I could never live with taking someone else's life, but in the event that I someday marry and have a family, if it would mean protecting them when their lives are in danger, I would do what I could to prevent their being harmed. I'm more of a bat kind of guy. But, the fact that I'm a very peaceful person in nature also points out why I disaprove of gun use, at least for myself. I don't believe owning one would make me anymore of a man, plus I wouldn't want to have to deal with the possibility of accidently ending someone's life. When my father was a kid, he had two cousins. One day, while their parents were outside talking to some relatives, the two boys went into their parent's room and found their father's gun in the closet. (This was around 1960, 1961). Anyway, they were only 5-8 years old, and they started playing with it. In that process, one of my father's cousins were killed. The other cousin, so stricken with the grief, killed himself many years later. I wouldn't be able to take it if something like that happened to me, or anyone in my own family. I acknowledge that there are many responsible people out there, and so I will not say fire arms should be illegal, but I will say for sure that I will never own one. Peace!|`|rR6lwxjjaa	im totally liberal on most subjects: gay marriage, tax policies, foreign policy, health care, education, the patriot act being a horrible bill, etc. etc.<br>  but i have to say that im in totally in favor of letting americans keep their guns; i own guns, my dad owns guns, my brother owns guns.  hell ive been shooting since i was 5 years old and i dont plan on quitting anytime soon... no matter what laws they might pass.<br>  <br>  REASONS: (i ranted now ill just list them in short reasons)<br>  - the government couldnt possible pay for the manpower it would take to enfore such a law that would ban all guns.  therefore only law abiding citizens *and not even all of them* would obey the law in the first place, and law abiding citizens dont go out and commit gun crimes like robbery or murder.  This makes the bill ruefully inadequate and the enforcement of such legislation would detract from the government's ability to deal with other *more or equally important* issues that plague society (like drugs and such)<br>  -with more gun education children who think of guns as toys due to movies and tv would come to think of them as the deadly weapons they are, respect their power, and there would be a drastic decrease in accidental shootings in homes where parents keep hidden guns but fail to teach their children proper safety.<br>  -people should not lose the power to defend themselves against criminals<br>  -I sincerely doubt that the gun bans would apply to the police and other government agencies, and if they can carry guns i believe the people should be able to as well.<br>  -guns are great for recreational purposes if one is properly educated to the dangers.  E.G. turkey shoots, hunting, target practicing, trap and skeet shooting.|`|yjSGVfdiaa	I'm pro-gun regulation.<br>  <br>  I'll probably never own one myself, but don't see a reason to completely outlaw them.  The reasons are many and mostly have already been outlined before I threw my two cents in.  If you are sane, well adjusted, have no criminal record, and of majority age - you should be able to get a gun - to hunt, for protection, etc.<br>  <br>  It's the same reason I'm pro-choice.

I'm not sure why.  I guess I thought banning guns would end gun related deaths.  And maybe it would.  But it would also trample the 2nd Amendment.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I joined the Army about five years ago and I spent the first three months carrying an M-16 everywhere I went.  It just became this piece of metal, nothing more, nothing less.  <br>  <br>  Now, I have fired all manner of crazy weapons, including some really weird Russian and Chinese stuff in Afghanistan and while I'm not going to join the NRA or purchase any weapons myself, I have no problem with others owning arsenals if that's what they want to do.

I believe in our right to have a gun but we don't need armour piercing bullets, automatic sub machine guns, or super type guns out on the streets. Life is full of bargains and compromise and I am a strong supporter of Obama Gun Laws. Some tend to think that his laws will take the guns out of our hands and that is Absolutely not true. His laws will regulate what type, what type of ammo, and who can get them a little bit more than what we have now. DON'T BE FOOLED BY OBAMA HATERS!!!

The facts are that Obama has some awesome gun reform that will help stupid sh!t from happening that happens way to much today.|`|yS61H04haa	I am pro guns.

A gun or two for those who like to hunt (which I'm anti too by the way) is fine, but nobody needs an arsenal in their home.

I have been a member of the NRA now for probably 10 years. It goes back to when I was a child, my step father who is still my step father and I would go hunting at least once a year. Deer season and we got permits every single year prior of course. I live in a big city that has grown Immensely the last 15 years. We have a very high crime rate as well as high violence and assault statistics. I live in a pretty decent community and its up town or central phoenix rather but there is still a lot of crime here. Without a firearm in the central city I feel almost naked for some reason. I just happen to know a lot of Sh** happens here and there are just a lot of sickos here and I don't know I don't trust ONE SINGLE PERSON PERIOD!!. So if someone wants to try and take advantage of me for whatever reason in a violent fashion whatsoever I will Fire at them.

I've been to the pistol range myself, just for kicks. That said, I don't own one, because I'd probably end up shooting someone. Most murders in the U.S. are committed by people the victims knew- family, spouses, "friends"- not strangers. That said the Second Amendment talks about a "well-regulated militia" which by definition means the purchase, ownership, and use of guns will be REGULATED (legislation, control of some kind). I find it absolutely loony that one needs a driver's license to own and operate a car in this country, but doesn't need a license to own and operate a gun. Somebody should be shot! (lol). Hey, and if the Right-wing Rednecks (also sarcasm) ever get too far out of hand, it may be necessary to own a gun and start a revolution.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh and I forgot.

VxE46bSFaa	I've had a lot, and I don't recall getting any bad dreams while I had them.|`|RaQH7GuCaa	Yes i have one that i made in like the third grade. It's HARD to make but its pretty! Ummmm... I actually haven't really noticed a difference... but that might just be because i haven't payed enough attention. You should get one and try it to see it it does anything for you. I didnt have many bad dreams anyway before so idk. If you get a lot of bad nightmares then i would try the Dream Catcher.|`|NfSz1VBZaa	Mine I got long time ago and always end up in the dresser or somewhere the dreams don't fly to.|`|AA11466534	I have one and so does my parents, sister, brother.   Yes they do work but only if real indians make them. If you do get a bad dream you are to take them down and shake the dreams out. Get one they have to be above you they really do work.  Try one you will see let me know ;-)

DbRce6wAaa	Hmm.. your right! It took forever to beat ONE in Guitar Hero 3. I'd love to see the challenge in Rock Band xD.<br>  <br>  But, there are only a few songs in Rock Band that are in the GH seris. In RB2, and GH:WT, there will be similar artists, but not similar songs. <br>  Well, if you have a PS3 or 360, you can just purchase teh song from the network and just pay, idk, a few bucks for the download. So, either way, your still good. (unless you don't have a PS3 or 360, then your just screwed like me >.< lol)  |`|DAxZ2BLmaa	Yeah its good but You got BATTERY on rb2 it is 10 times better than ONE geez but it is a very good song! I was helping you.<br>  <br>  EDIT:You guitar hero posers or in your case RB1&2 posers are something else.ONE was already on a game(guitar hero 3 )they cant put it on another game! its not rite.<br>  BY the way: I was helping you, Im not fat you can count on that, Im not a geek, so dont call me one, All I was was helping you! <br>  <br>  EDIT: thank you, ONE is amazing but in all honesty, MASTER OF PUPPETS is wayyyy better then AJFA!|`|oUZLZusjaa	Same reason any other song is or isn't on there. I guess that just wasn't a song that they wanted to put in the game, or maybe they couldn't get the rights to use the original recording of the song, so they didn't put it in.|`|5IYIYC1Saa	well one is too good for that game anyway. to hardcore and people will never be as good as the original performers as metallica even if it is a game or they just don't think it's easy enough for people to handle|`|RuvJUgnIaa	That's probably because it was on Guitar Hero 3 :P|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Well, it does have a rather long, boring intro to it, and I can't imagine it would be a whole lot of fun to play.

GG8x2kmfaa	Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, Dimebag, and Buckethead.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Jimi Hendrix. He was a lefty just like me. My Brother tried to teach me, but he is right handed and doesn't think like a lefty.<br>  <br>  Plus he's HENDRIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  How cool would that be?|`|Z5VCTFruaa	Johnny Marr because he is a great guitarist and that's the kind of music I would like to learn to play |`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Jimi Hendrix, he was awesome and I need to learn left handed anyway|`|YA4qCDukaa	jimi hendrix or jimmy paige....|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Brian May.  no doubt.|`|mkshF2Pfaa	I find that it's better to LEARN on one's own- that way you develop a more natural feel for the instrument... The polishing is what the instructors are for... But as far as techniques go...<br>  <br>  Adam Jones from Tool, or Billy Howerdel (APC). <br>  <br>  After them, Mark Morton (Lamb of God), Zakk Wylde, Darron from System of a Down (I forget his last name), and the Slipknot guys (just for fun, really- they've got some fascinating concepts for sound, I'd more so just like to observe them in the writing process).|`|DnWsMhwLaa	joe satriani (can do anything he wants, and he taught steve vai and charlie hunter, so he has a proven record as a teacher, too), correy harris (can do so many diverse things, can play in so many genres fingerpick ect plus incredibly knowledgable) and joe pass (one word: tone. well, more than one word, expert tone, expert spacing, a real master at taking and leaving space in his solos)<br>  <br>  i would say jimi, but he doesnt strike me as much of a teacher.|`|3cfGSkAiaa	As someone said already, Jimi was a lefty. I play lefty as well, so I'd pick him. Actually, I'd probably pick him even if I wasn't left handed!|`|9hCezzwRaa	I would like to take lessons from the greatest thrash guitarist ever.  Alex Skolnick.  If I could ever play half as good as him I could die a happy man.|`|9hFexadLaa	Kurt Cobain - hes my idol<br>  <br>  Zakk Wylde - hes a beast<br>  <br>  Eddie Van Halen - none better<br>  <br>  Jimmy Paige - STAIRWAY|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	Alex Skolnick<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Tony MacAlpine|`|CwUeQ5ERaa	Dimebag. |`|GhI9wYUiaa	pete townsend, and jimmy paige|`|F19vsdLDaa	The two I would love to be given personal lessons by:<br>  <br>  Zakk Wylde<br>  <br>  David Gilmour<br>  <br>  Both have unique sounds and have amazing feeling in their style. Zakk makes his guitar sound like a dream and the bends and tapping all so fast and still melodic, not trashy. And Dave is one of the most influential guitarists of all time. Ask anyone, I'm sure they know at least one Pink Floyd song. His technique and sound are one in a million.<br>  <br>  Runners Up: Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimmy Page|`|BCFmz8Ydaa	James Hetfield: for that insane downpicking he does and awesome riffs,<br>  he can play Battery and sing it at the same time<br>  <br>  Tom Morrello: for those mad effects<br>  <br>  Dimebag: for those Monster style riffs and squeals<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|A3krb9Ffaa	I would have to say Malmsteen, Vai, Satriani or even Petrucci.<br>  I have also always been a fan of Carlos Santana.|`|PJcIRTOAaa	Definetly Dimebag, and James Hetfield for his killer rythm playing.|`|Tv0zrUOwaa	Yngwie Malmsteen, extremely good, or Steve Vai best 7 string player ever. Jimmy Page and Joe Satriani would be great as well|`|upQCNyxKaa	If only Dimebag were still alive today.|`|kzMUBU7Jaa	MetallicA's Kirk Hammett or the Eagles Don Felder|`|srUCvZtLaa	Noodles or Dan Jacobs|`|V0S92gZLaa	Well, out of all of my idols, I narrowed it down to four:<br>  <br>  Kirk Hammet: I am a hardcore Metallica fan, for one thing. Also, his solos are incredibly fast and intense, for one thing. For another, they are melodic. He has a way of playing that just channels pure emotion into his playing. Just listen to the solo(s) of Fade to Black -- all 3 or 4 of them!!! Amazing. Pure brilliance<br>  <br>  John Petrucci of Dream Theater: I would LOVE to learn how to have his technicality, meticulous preciseness, and utterly completely mind-blowing speed. NO ONE would mess with me! Just listen to Paradigm Shift from his side project Liquid Tension Experiment. Pure beastiness.<br>  <br>  Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains: He writes some of the best acoustic riffs and songs. I would want to learn from his songwriting skills and also from his emotional soloing. He also makes incredibly simple, yet awesome grunge/metal riffs. For acoustic brilliance, check out Down In A Hole, Heaven Beside You, and Nutshell. For simple, yet awesome metal riffs, check out Man In A Box, Again, and Them Bones. And, for solos, check out any of the above mentioned songs plus any other AIC songs you find.<br>  <br>  George Lynch: I am a hardcore '80's metal/hair metal fan. I could have chosen Snake Sabo from Skid Row, Glen Tipton/K. K. Downing of Judas Priest, or Mick Mars of Motley Crue, but Geoge Lynch is definately the most talented out of the hair metal era. His crazy legato technique and ability to make anything from the ballad of Alone Again to the heavy-ish-ness of Breaking The Chains. See: Mr. Scary for scary-awesome guitar work, Alone Again for power ballad needs, and In My Dreams and Breaking The Chains for generic hair-metal-era music.<br>  <br>  And, btw, my wish to be taught by George Lynch may come true!!!! He's coming to a local guitar shop on October 28 for one of his Extreme Rock Guitar workshops!!!! And I am PUMPED!!!!

C7YbYUYPaa	  I think you are making the right choice in Fender, but after that I'm not much help.  The only guitar I've ever played was my Strat, and I haven't felt the need to get a different one yet.  Happy hunting though, you know as well as I do that the feel of the guitar is the most important part.<br>  <br>  MA: Oh yea, I rarely listen to CD's.  All of my stuff is vinyl.<br>  BA: Yea, I find that show hilarious, but sometimes it can be really horrible.

They inspired many people they started a peace movement that would ultimately make them legendary.

They will always be remembered as one of the most influential bands of their time and now.|`|I5PYvCz8aa	Aerosmith.  They were the American Rolling Stones and a huge influence on every hard rock band since the late 70's.<br>  <br>  Van Halen.  All of those "hair metal" bands in the 80's were basically trying to be Van Halen.  Look at the David Lee Roth era.  Edward Van Halen was the most influential rock guitarist since Hendrix, and he forever changed the way we perceive those who play the electric guitar.  How many people started playing guitar because of him, or because of someone else who started playing  guitar because of him?<br>  <br>  Again, Black Sabbath.  These guys invented heavy metal, Ozzy Osbourne, and they gave birth to everything that came after.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Queen.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of musicians that have cited Queen as their inspiration, but namely Freddie Mercury and Brian May.

Try to stretch (like you are warming up) before you go to see her. <br>  <br>  Don't go to anyone who has a shop next to a bar!

LkN5nr6faa	It might inspire someone to pick up a guitar, and if one person picks up a guitar because of a video game, then the game is a success in my opinion. Music is so overlooked as a hobby and pastime nowadays that anytime someone can get into music (in any possible means) it makes me happy.|`|nhk5zzaeaa	Totally agree here...|`|Mo5xfgOnaa	I partly agree with you (on the grounds that it isn't all bad.) Not on the same point to be exact. <br>  <br>  I don't believe this game inspires kids to take up guitar as much as you think, if anything I think it consumes their time leaving little for 'real' artistic pursuits. (At least that's the case with most of the Guitar Hero players I know.) On the other hand, I do agree that the game introduces today's kids to classic rock.  Still my biggest grievance with the game is that it cheapens the impact of these great songs from the past. I've always listened to classic rock and I can't tell you how many times some Guitar Hero playing kid ruins it for me when he says some moronic statement like "Hey I know this song! I got x thousand points playing it on expert." Seriously, I'm thinking, "You simple minded fool. This is a great song with more depth and to you that's all that it conjures?" So yeah, I said my piece.|`|h26FZfrbaa	This game raises some serious questions.  No doubt it moves guitars off the shelves, but how many of those guitars end up collecting dust because learning to really play the thing requires study, discipline, and a certain amount of talent?<br>  One can no more claim to be a musician by playing guitar hero than could claim to be a surgeon by playing "Operation"<br>  It is really a driving game where one must hit targets on a highway, (or in this case a "fretboard"), and the music is incidental.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	It may increase the sale of $100 starter packs of crappy guitars combined with worse amplifiers to kids who think it would be "kewl" to play a real guitar.<br>  But those kids are going to quickly find out that it's actually a lot harder than the game makes it look and give up (helped along by wanting "free online websites" for instruction and having rubbish for equipment).<br>  Some of them would likely have picked up a decent instrument at some point and actually learned to play rather nicely, rather than now being lost forever.<br>  <br>  So while it may increase guitar sales of lowend instruments (which might in turn subsidise the production of decent instruments, keeping their prices relatively lower), it IMO won't increase the number of people who can actually play the guitar (though it may indeed increase the number of idiot kids who think they are Jimmy Hendrix or SRV when in fact they don't know a G-string from a piece of underwear).|`|SxAOmZJnaa	That is exactly what I have said all along, it motivates kids to go out and take guitar lessons.|`|vFrnGtiDaa	I view guitar hero as introducing people to some great bands.  I mean, the stuff you don't ALWAYS hear on the radio.  Lets face it.  Too many people rely on MTV and the radio for their music sources.  Guitar hero actually introduces people to more unknown bands that deserve some spotlight.  While people may argue that they don't like the fact that a person rants about one or two songs they hear on Guitar Hero, I think it is still good that a new band is at least presented to new fans.  Hopefully, some of those people who found out about those bands on Guitar Hero actually looked up more of the band's songs and became a real fan.|`|Io1aOqKkaa	When i first got my Guitar Hero it did inspired me to play guitar, but after that i started playing more and when my cousin wouldn't let me play the guitar part, i started to like bass better. <br>   <br>  I would love to play guitar or bass, but guitar hero did introduced me into AFI and Slipknot, maybe not the best bands ever but i thank guitar hero for introducing me into them.|`|3cfGSkAiaa	No, you are not completely wrong.<br>  My youngest brother took up drums because Rock Band got him interested in it. That really pissed me off though. I'd been urging him to let me teach him guitar or bass for years. But now that the video game says it's cool he does it xD|`|Phy5JyU2aa	yeah. i was 13 when the 1st one came out, and after it did, iw anted to leanr to play the real guitar. im 16 now, and im learning to play guitar, and i probably wouldnt have been as motivated to learn as i am now.<br>  <br>  |`|1CSFFKxYaa	I agree with you completely. In fact, after playing Guitar Hero, I may actually take up actual guitar lessons. If I feel this happy playing 'pretend guitar', I'm probably going to be absolutely jubilant when I do the real thing.|`|KfX1z8hOaa	Well maybe yes, and maybe no. Some/most of the kids will start getting discouraged when they can't play as good as the guitar hero songs and might quit right away, and just go the virtual way.|`|lCWeznyKaa	NOpe, I just hate ppl who know think they know about music because of guitar hero |`|bcf90f443eae0481fa2ec135dbb5f0fcaa	im sure you are right and it does inspire alot of people to play the guitar|`|603aff9cf92cd0943b62e2b0ef483ff7aa	well as a guitar hero player and real guitar player, i think it can be good or bad for getting kids to play real guitar, but i think the real good thing about it is that it turns people on to real good music whereas a lot of kids wouldnt get exposed to it.|`|UtiHQVSUaa	ya know, that is a good point and i haven't really thought of it that way, but not everybody has the persistence to play the guitar for long, and we'll have a wave of crappy, cocky guitarist hitting the earth|`|2yHSLTPoaa	Actually, I'm 13 and ever since I started playing guitar hero, it HAS inspired me to play real guitar. My uncle who has been playing guitar for many years is now teaching me how to play! (:|`|MPIb4LsZaa	Alot of people stand up to play guitar hero, at least that's more active than sitting down.|`|RarFFlF4aa	I think you share a view with Led Zeppelin.<br>  They refuse to join the game for some similar reasons.

During the 80's they were highly recognized and popular. Today's kids may not have heard of them, but that doesn't take away from who they were.|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Definitely true, along with Supertramp!|`|EblQojpEaa	Talking heads are great!

C7YbYUYPaa	Those days are gone I'm afraid.  The Mick Jaggers, David Bowies, Robert Plants, and Freddie Mercurys are no more.  The main problem with this new generation of frontmen?  They lack talent.  Call me closeminded, but I have yet to hear a good vocalist in these newer bands.|`|5k9XizbMaa	I'm with you on this one, people just don't care anymore.

3zxyzNOWaa	80's beyotch|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	The 80s Hair Metal or 70s Punk Scenes were waaaaaay better than todays music.<br>  <br>  Not very many good bands out of todays music. Very few good 'uns.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	I prefer 70's and 80's bands. Nowadays, I listen to a few songs here and there, but rarely the entirety of a single band's catalogue.|`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	Classic, just because familiar songs are comforting. Realistically though, there are great songs in every decade. A person just has to go out there and find them.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Classic Rock all the way.  Today's music misses the feeling that the 60s 70s and 80s had.  Those guys poured their hear and soul into those songs.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Play both and all music is great. |`|T0ed2lhJaa	hi clssic rock todays bands arnt that good.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	The classics are way better.  I'm 16, going on 17, and people pretty much expect me to like the crap of today... my dad puts the blame of all the sh*tty music on me, and my generation, for whatever reason... yet i hate the music today.  I'm listening to those 60's, 70's, 80's bands each night.  Each band is so unique, and each song is so amazing- today, everything sounds the same.|`|0fc5476eec74c43513d46d4ec3202519aa	I prefer anything up until the mid 90's.  With the exception of a few new bands, pretty much any bands that formed after then are all just god awful.  Case in point:  Panic at the disco.  Fall out Boy.  Alkaline Trio (im not sure when they started but they went south quickly)<br>  <br>  bands that formed before then that still kick *** today, and stay true to their sound:  Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Local H, System of a Down (even if they are 'on hiatus'), and a few others that totally rule.<br>  <br>  Otherwise,  the 70's scene, the "grunge" scene,  thats where i wish i was at.  The music that came out of there rocks so hard its not even funny.|`|SMPRH189aa	i like metallica if that count as old lol<br>  <br>  but seriously<br>  now rock is more in my catergory|`|KBQq5VPYaa	Easiest question ever.

lMOXHh45aa	you know, the other day when i asked to rate *MY* beat i was hopin you would tell me, but just cosigned what i said about that person with that picture... so imma wait lol, i'll rate yours once you rate mines <br>  <br>  EDIT: oh ok... i gotta give this about a 6/10, it's a lil too repetitive for me, and it didn't seem to have any chorus|`|7gH7sgi6aa	I really enjoyed it.  It actually "screamed" out for some words to be rapped out on top of it.  The beat was hot and it was live.  It was as if it the beat was actually calling out for some lyrics to be said....I rate a solid 8.5/10.  I thought it was fresh and unique.  I didn't hear any "take me out to the ballgame though"<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|DDmFQU7raa	Not a bad beat. I think the title should be a baseball-themed title. It sounds more like "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" than a love song.<br>  <br>  7/10

UxSF3Doaaa	As someone who knows about God all her life, and I spent my 20s and early part of my 30s doing things that hurt my walk with God. I am trying to do away with as much past regrets as possible, be better about following God, and and not look back. One of my biggest regrets is having gave up my virginity at the age of 20. what happened then was Satan had gotten a tight grip on me and I fell into his trap. When I was weeks from 22, God called me back to him, but it has been a struggle ever since. It did not help matters I kept being with guys who did not want to wait until marriage before doing "the intimate thing". I don't get guys ( NICE guys) very easily, as they view me as not worth their time I reckon because they hate the way I look, but I vowed to myself from this day forward if the guy won't wait until I'm ready, then he cannot have me. I consider it a blessing I don't have HIV/AIDS.  I also wounded up with guys who either did not belief in God or they did, but did not really care to practice. But next time I see someone is going to get in the way of my practicing, then he can't have me either.<br>  <br>  It's not in the real me to take pleasure in doing wrong. Sooner or later I will feel the HEAVIEST  level of guilt when I do something that is not right. Even after the person forgives me if I done against them, and tell me not to worry about it, I stil kick myself for it for some amount of time later.<br>  <br>  Right now I am trying to become the person I would be had I not got mixed up with the wrong guys, had I not looked for human love from the wrong places ( not just romantic, but also platonic as well). And if I could go back in time, I'd reclaim my virginity so that if I'm fortunate enough to ever be found by Mr. Prince Charming for life, he would have it. My heart severely breaks over the fact I know my first husband, IF I ever get to have one, it severely breaks my heart knowing he won't be my first because he would deserve that part of me more than any guy I been with.<br>  Last year, series of events occured, and God one day in a way that was quite embarrassing to me, last fall I restarted reading the Bible in hopes that that time I will stick with it and not be out of habit, I went to see an author at this church, and when it came time for people to be prayed for who wanted to be prayed for, I was hoping to receive the gift of speaking in tongue, but instead blurted out "HELP ME JESUS! I AM BROKEN AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!" I was by the pastor, and he layed hands on me. After that, I did not look people in the eye, but no one ridiculed me luckily. One of them viewed me as courageous. It was God's way of letting me know I needed to humble down and get my stuff straight. That I needed to better about letting Him guide me instead of trying to make all the decisions myself and trying to make everything happen myself.<br>  I still got my work cut out for me, and I can relate to Los Boys song How Far From Heaven, but I want to believe I'm a little closer to being better than I used to be.<br>  <br>  My apologies if I caused you to fall asleep with my "book writing!"

You'll figure everything out soon enough, and then you'll regret spending your last day of summer worrying about the future!"<br>  <br>  I didn't get lost on the first day, and none of the upperclassmen have done anything to me.

wWdQSuCbaa	When I see something completely lame..I say.."Wow..What a joke.."<br>  :]|`|9DIpVPl1aa	when you read this: <br>  One day, little Johnny asked his mom what sex was. <br>  "Tonight, go into your sister’s room, hide behind the curtain, and watch what <br>  she and her boyfriend do. <br>  The following morning, Johnny’s mom asked what happened. <br>  Little Johnny explained "well at first, they were just kinda talking and <br>  laughing, but after a while they started kissing and hugging, sister got a fever, <br>  cuz she said she was feeling hot. <br>  So sister’s boyfriend put his hand under her shirt to find her heart, just <br>  like the doctor would. <br>  Except he’s not so smart because both of them got sick and they started <br>  panting and getting all out of breath. <br>  His other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. <br>  About this time sis got worse and began to moan and sigh, and squirm around <br>  and slide to the end of her bed. then i finally found out what was making them <br>  sick - a big eel had gotten inside her boyfriend’s pants somehow. <br>  It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long! <br>  anyways he gripped it in one hand to keep it from getting away. <br>  When sis saw it, she got really scared - her eyes got big, and her mouth fell <br>  open, and she started calling to God and stuff like that. <br>  She said it was the biggest one she had ever seen, I should tell her about <br>  the ones by the lake, anyway sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting <br>  its head off. <br>  All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and tried to keep it from <br>  biting again. <br>  Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it, and <br>  the boyfriend helped by lying on top of the eel. <br>  The eel put on a heck of a fight. Sis started moaning and squealing and her <br>  boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by <br>  squishing it between them. <br>  After a while, they both stopped moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend <br>  got up, and sure enough they had killed the eel! <br>  I knew because it just hung there and also because some of its insides were <br>  dripping out. <br>  Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back <br>  to the bed anyway! <br>  He started hugging and kissing her again! by golly, the eel wasn’t dead! It <br>  jumped straight up and started to fight again. <br>  I guess eels are like cats-they have nine lives or something like that. this <br>  time, sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. <br>  After a 35 minute struggle they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead <br>  because I saw sis boyfriend peel it’s skin off and flush it down the toilet!" <br>  Little Johnny’s mom fainted|`|BwEN0hWAaa	never heard of it, maybe when you hear a joke...

Delp left two notes taped to a door and letters to his family and his fiancee, Pamela Sullivan. Baldwin said police do not know the letters' contents because they were sealed.<br>  <br>  Delp, 55, was a native of Danvers, Mass. He had planned to marry Sullivan this summer during a tour with Boston. Delp, a lifelong Beatles fan, also played with Beatles tribute band Beatlejuice.<br>  <br>  "He was a man who gave all he had to give to everyone around him, whether family, friends, fans, or strangers," the family statement said. "He gave as long as he could, as best he could, and he was very tired. We take comfort in knowing that he is now, at last, at peace."<br>  <br>  Agent Troy Blakely said he had not been in touch with Delp recently, but believed Delp had been looking forward to getting married and touring again. "There was no indication of anything amiss," he said. In his 34 years of representing artists, Blakely said he never met a kinder man.<br>  <br>  The family's statement said Sullivan, Delp's children, and their mother, his former wife Micki Delp, were grateful for the sympathy they had received and asked that their privacy be respected.<br>  <br>  The funeral will be private, with a public memorial service at a later date.|`|AA11594108	You knew what he put out to the public, you didn't know the things that drove him and motivated him in his personal life.<br>  <br>  Just remember him for the good things he did.

d2RV8HTmaa	I'm with you on the boring storylines lately.  However, I've been such a long-time fan of AMC, I keep just watching and waiting that it will get better!  But yeah, it's been so depressing lately.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I wouldn't blame you one bit.  AMC has been going downhill for a long time.  It's not like it used to be back in the days of Cliff and Nina, Jesse and Angie (when they were younger), and Erica with all her men and all the excitement.  Erica's character has become really boring.  I think most of the cast should've been killed off in the tornado, especially Zach and Kendall.  I can't stand those two characters.  The only good move they made is bringing David Hayward back to town.  At least he brings excitement and passion to the show.  He's super hot, too.  We need new writers, characters, everything for this show.|`|AA12390047	I enjoy AMC - of course it has good and bad story lines, so I ff thru the ones I don't like.<br>  I think you should find a soap you thoroughly enjoy and watch it whether it's AMC or not.  Right now, OLTL is really good.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Well, try not to give up. Soaps get stuck in ruts it seems more often than not lately and AMC is having the biggest problem. They ae promising good stuff coming up though.|`|6kBAj12gaa	I think we just need to give it time. I mean There was two pretty big eventful things that occurred you had the tornado and everything that led up to Greenlee's death...so if anything other major happens it would just become unrealistic....i agree with everyone that they are in a rut keeping it a steady plot to have a BANG of excitement in Pine Valley. I wouldnt be surprised if they spend a good portion of funding for the tornado event especially since it went on as long as it did so now they are saving up for something bigger to happen that will draw everyones attention back...<br>  <br>  but in a sence we may need to continue watching because little things will be tied together for that big event and if we skip out on watching it it will be pretty confusing in the end and not as exciting. Im finding the whole Amanda story interesting and now with Little A and JRs situation.....but I think if we be patient AMC will make us proud : )|`|cCqqaKAuaa	You're right..the show is becoming rather boring. I've been watching the show since it aired.<br>  The storyline of Zack & Kendal is becoming a yawn. She's become a total b**** since waking up from the coma. The David Hayward thing is a bit much too. I often wonder why he always dresses in black, and NEVER looks as though his hair is combed. <br>  The writers must think the fans are stupid. Just think; J.R. thinks Amanda's baby is his, David suspects the baby is his baby. Obviously from the story line, safe sex wasn't practised which is why Jake should be concerned as well. Hayward is a Dr. on the show, & it's always impressed upon people to practise safe sex; yet a Dr. did what he did. Go figure.<br>  Amazingly, patients waking up from a coma or major surgery are groggy just for a few moments, then begin talking as though they'd been away for a few days. Don't we wish that were truly the case.<br>  I'll persist a little longer, then see what transpires.|`|YI9cEtFvaa	well general hospital is my fave and always will be. but i have gotten so tired of how boring amc has been. it was between all my children and one life to live as my second choice and i think oltl has gotten so much better with their storylines so i chose oltl over amc. sooo sad that its gotten so boring.|`|dvevk1qbaa	I think they are trying to figure out where they are going<br>  <br>  i actually like it, but I want to see aidan and annie get into some drama<br>  <br>  And i want to see Amanda and Jake fall in love, or fall in bed hehe<br>  <br>  I thought Kendal was going to be more off the hook when she woke up--im bummed about that. I thought she was going to be a half josh/half kendall creature --is that too old school soap style?? lol|`|hKyOUVXIaa	Don't leave!  What goes down must come back up. There have been many times when things get stuck in a rut, but they eventually come out of the rut and become exciting again. I think you just need to be patient and enjoy the ride. Zach is giving Kendall a taste of her own medicine, she has never been able to let go of Ryan, and things are just getting exciting with Amanda and JR and David and Krystal. Hang on, it will get better.|`|Wu9SjRCXaa	I would LOVE for them to bring back Trey (Kendall's half-brother).  He played both good and bad at times so they could do a lot with him.  He would also be out of jail for torching Erica's house by now-he was given 3-5 years in prison in 2003.  <br>  I just love Sam Page who played Trey!|`|OSt9X8puaa	i wish they would spice it up a lil.i can not turn my back on amc though i have watched this show all my life and just because they are in a rough patch i ain't going to walk away it will heat up in may sweeps|`|Lj9nvqMWaa	amc is so boring!!!!!go to gh! more action and way better storylines that any other soap|`|rZQYCpabaa	I think that I am sick of the Zach and Kendall Poor Us Show and the Let's hate on Reese who hasn't done really anything wrong Show.<br>  <br>  I wish we could focus more on Annie.

Kendall and Zach need to get back together and stop hurting each other. Ship Ryan off to La La Land. Bring Dixie and Brooke back. Also Nina and Cliff, Tara and Philip.|`|AA12319351	I agree  with you. The story lines and some of the acting is getting down right dull.They seem to be using the same story line over and over. But also being a long time fan(I've watched it since day one) I will keep my fingers crossed that somehow it will get better. Right now the only bright spot on the show is Brot I wish they would use him more.

xwD8PUFlaa	According 2 a friend of mine, Metallica are emo & hip/hop is a more complex genre then heavy metal.|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	There was one I heard about The Beatles (not sure if I remember it exactly): "They were just a bunch of scruffy old men with 1 hit." Then there was "The Jonas Brothers are better than Metallica. Metallica is just pressing a few random notes on a guitar" And then there are those people who spell Lynyrd Skynyrd as "Lenard Skinard" and refer to multiple bands as "he." What has society been reduced to? How did this happen? Oh yeah, the Jonass Fags<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Here's 2 more I remember right now. We had some Elvis tribute come on. What do I hear? "Oh, he sucks at singing" This next one was more personal. My teacher puts on the radio and Knights of Cydonia (my favorite song) comes on. Up out of nowhere comes an "ew"|`|Yc9uPziVaa	Today this one dude i was talking to said he hates Radiohead and that they suck<br>  <br>  i set him straight.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	My friend actually thinks Lil Waynes rock song is GOOD..<br>  <br>  And she also said 'Who even listens to the Beatles anymore?!

Sinon, préviens-moi, que je te l'envoie une seconde fois.<br>  Je t'écris lentement, car je sais que tu ne lis pas rapidement.Dernièrement, ton père a lu une enquète disant que la plupart des accidents se produisent à quelques kilomètres de la maison, c'est pour cela que nous avons décidé de déménager un peu plus loin.<br>  La maison est splendide, il y a une machine à  laver, mais j'ignore si elle est en service. Hier j'y ai mis le linge, tiré sur la chainette, et tout a disparu je ne sais ou! mais je continue à  chercher le mode d'emploi.<br>  Le temps n'est pas trop désagréable ici, la semaine dernière, il n'a plu que deux fois. La première pendant trois jours, la seconde quatre jours.<br>  Au sujet du manteau que tu désirais, ton oncle Pierre a dit que si je l'expédiais avec les boutons, qui sont lourds, cela couterait très cher, alors je les ai arrachés et te les ai mis dans une des poches.<br>  Une bonne nouvelle, ton père a trouvé du travail, il a sous lui environ 500 personnes : il fauche les herbes du cimetière.<br>  Ta soeur Julie, qui vient de se marier, attends un heureux évènement. Nous ignorons le sexe, c'est pourquoi je ne peux te dire si tu seras oncle ou tante. Si c'est une fille, elle a l'intention de l'appeler<br>  comme moi. Cela me fait tout dr?le de savoir qu'elle va appeler sa fille "maman".<br>  Ton frère Jean a eu un gros problème, il a fermé sa voiture avec les clès à  l'intérieur. Il a du retourner à la maison, 10 kilomètres aller retour à  pied pour récupèrer le second jeu de clés et enfin nous sortir du véhicule.<br>  Si tu as l'occasion de rencontrer ta cousine Monique donne-lui le bonjour de ma part. Si tu ne la vois pas, ne lui dis rien c'est plus<br>  simple.<br>  <br>  Ta Maman<br>  <br>  PS : je voulais te mettre un peu d'argent dans l'enveloppe, mais je l'ai déjà collée."|`|C2TQ4fSxaa	Excellente blague, Mdr!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|tvhnDMQzaa	Très bonne (*) !<br>  <br>  Pourquoi observe-t-on un flux et un reflux de la mer ?<br>  - Parce qu'il y a très longtemps, les Belges sont venus s'installer près de la plage.

h1d0AA95aa	If you are looking for an evolution of Bowie to me the new Radiohead album In Rainbows, or Silverchair album Young Modern ring a bell.  But music is so subjective it is so hard to say... I mean if you are looking for something that sounds like David Bowie then that brings up the question of what album, and what song!  So I don't know, that is just an idea off the top of my head.<br>  Hope it helps!
OKqX6PP8aa	Of course!<br>  Which is the meaning of "each other"?<br>  john|`|wmBK9uASaa	Easier just to not own a phone,|`|QI74CxD0aa	Good point.<br>  <br>  I wonder whether they have something important to say or always yakking has become an addiction.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes. These technological devices are supposed to connect people better, but all I see is people shutting each other out. The worst it can get is when a mother or father shuts out their own family to gab on the cell. Horrible!|`|13hDE66Oaa	Don't we do that already?<br>  <br>  Technology is a double-edged sword, unfortunately. |`|QbJ04Zqiaa	We wouldn't even need them if nobody ever got off their computers!   :)|`|QVPlQ9pMaa	Yeah, this world really is going down. I bet a lot of people feel that way, get a group of people together and just talk to them, not on a phone or through email just face to face, person-to-person. No, I don't think everyone should carry super sophisticated cell phones and ignore people that are right there. I think it's OK to have really cool phones but just use them to make a call occasionally and when you're around people put the phone away and just notice and talk to the people beside you. I think that technology is getting out of hand, especially with Apple's new iPhone. |`|WffZ7iD1aa	Yes. You can tell when someone doesn't want to even acknowledge you because they use their cell phone as a way to ignore you. Usually they are spoiled yuppies who judge based on appearances and wouldn't appreciate having such a deep, thoughtful, easy-going, un-materialistic friend anyway.|`|VxE46bSFaa	Hahaha they should all hold them up and pretend to talk into them to look even more sophisticated. :)

q3KCDrMAaa	I am not dating or married to a virgo, but I am a capricorn and virgos get along well with caps. Virgos pretty much get along with EVERYONE! :) They are friendly people, HOWEVER, they prefer smart, alert people. <br>  <br>  They tend to ignore other people's short comings and are very accepting. They do beat themselves up a bit though over silly things. They always seem to want to be perfect and even when they are, they think they can do better. They need to be paired with loving water signs. People who will appreciate their loyalty while giving them the loving support they deserve. :)|`|MMF1YmZZaa	Dating a Virgo, and going to marry him. I am a Libra, and I can find him a bit challenging at times. He is very meticulous about his appearance and so picky. I always joke that he had OCD lol.<br>  <br>  But, he is also one of the sweetest, most kindhearted people I know. He is very aware when something is bothering me and I love him a whole lot.|`|fIxzUq5laa	Hanging out off and on with a virgo guy. Sometimes he can be a challenge and he is very insecure about himself. We have been hanging out for more than one year and he has not made an attempt to kiss me although he touches me and holds my hand. I finally kissed him couple of days ago and I think he got scared. <br>  <br>  I love virgos. Very nice people, my mother is one. <br>  <br>  Only if I can understand them it would make my life easier. I am a Taurus.

A song that personifys the genre or a song that describes rock & roll or a song that makes you 'feel' rock & roll?  It all comes down to personal interpretation, which I think is what most artists try for (or at least some rock artists do).  I'm sort of a classic rock guy, so there are alot of 'older' songs that do it for me.  I'm a die-hard Beatles fan, so their songs are way up on my list.  Some good classic rock songs that sing about rock are:  Jukebox Hero, Shooting Star, Bat Out Of Hell.....the list could go on for days!!  So thanks for the great question and making us all think about our favorites from days gone by!  Rock On.|`|AA10795350	David Bowie - "Ziggy Stardust"<br>  <br>  "He took it all too far, but boy could he play guitar."

UZ8wsmuFaa	Yes. I tried stopping subvocalization, to read faster but I couldn't break the habit.<br>  <br>  My dad says reading first and last letter only speeds reading better.

Isn't that how most people read?<br>  <br>  I had to look up subvocalize, here's the definition subvocalize: the internal speech made when reading a word, thus allowing the reader to imagine the sound of a word being read|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Not every word.

Et ce trésor, c'est son cochon. D'après lui, ce cochon est " le cochon le plus intelligent du monde "...<br>  Un beau jour, un journaliste du quotidien local vient à apprendre qu'un cochon plus intelligent que la moyenne vit dans une ferme du voisinage. Le journaliste prend sa voiture et va se rendre compte lui-même sur place. Lorsqu'il arrive dans la ferme, il voit les batiments en ruine, et se demande comment, à notre époque, On peut encore vivre comme ?a... Puis le paysan sort de la baraque. Alors le journaliste lui demande :<br>  - Bonjour ! Je suis journaliste de presse et j'ai appris que vous possédiez un cochon extraordinaire.<br>  Le pauvre paysan lui répond : <br>  - C'est vrai. Puis il siffle un coup entre ses dents, et un cochon qui n'a plus que trois pattes sort de l'étable.<br>  - C'est lui, dit le paysan. Le journaliste voit le cochon et demande :<br>  - Et qu'est-ce qui vous fait dire qu'il est le cochon le plus intelligent du monde ? Le paysan répond :<br>  - L'hiver dernier, j'étais dehors en train de réparer des cl?tures et ma femme était en ville pour vendre du fromage. Notre petit bébé était à l'étage, dans la maison, en train de dormir dans son berceau... Lorsqu'un incendie a enflammé la maison (ma femme avait oublié son fer à repasser sur le linge). A ce moment-là, le cochon a couru dans la maison, monté l'escalier, attrapé le bébé en prenant son bras dans sa machoire, sans lui faire mal, puis il est redescendu et a déposé le bébé sur le sol, à l'abri des flammes. Ensuite, il est parti me chercher dans le pré et j'ai pu éteindre l'incendie avant qu'il n'y ait trop de dégats.<br>  - Wow, dit le journaliste, c'est incroyable.<br>  - Et ce n'est pas tout ! Un jour que je travaillais la terre dans le champ d'à c?té, la herse était pleine de terre et d'herbe. Alors j'ai mis le tracteur au point mort, je suis descendu et j'ai commencé à nettoyer sous la herse. Mais la vitesse du tracteur s'est enclenchée toute seule et je me suis trouve renversé par la herse et entra?né par l'attelage. J'ai cru que j'étais un homme mort... Mais le cochon avait d? sentir qu'il se passait quelque chose : il est allé chercher une corde, a rattrapé le tracteur et la herse, m'a laissé un bout de corde, et a tiré de toutes ses forces à l'autre bout. C'est grace à lui si je suis encore là aujourd'hui. <br>  - C'est vraiment extraordinaire, lui répond le journaliste. Mais, dites-moi, comment se fait-il qu'il n'ait plus que trois pattes ?<br>  - Ben, quand on a un cochon aussi bon et intelligent, on ne peut pas le manger tout d'un coup...|`|vMKIy3tHaa	parce que il faut toujours un brouillion avant le chef d'oeuvre ?<br>  Si c'est sa je me vexe ^^ <br>  J'suis blonde !

Someone tells us "Don't touch the paint, it's wet!", our natural curiosity kicks in to see if it really is wet.  However, impatience would stop us from counting all the stars in the sky.  <br>  <br>  Although this answer is completety ludicrious, you have to admit it sounds really good.|`|iRz91Jzjaa	'Cause it is pretty obvious that there are billions of stars. The sun isn't the only one. If all the lights were off in a city, it's pretty obvious.<br>  On the other side of paint. Sometimes paint can be glazed, which would explain the paint being shiney. Then again, it may be wet. You never know unless you touch it.|`|yHmrGcW9aa	I think it's because its just the temptation. you can see the stars in the sky and you've heard it so many times from so many people its easy to believe. But with wet paint. you're curious. and wanna no if its dry yet....|`|0zZZHXvVaa	lmao thats true|`|Xjds0SPOaa	because you can't actually check to make sure there are billions of stars your only choice is to take someone elses word but you can check the paint its right in front of you|`|ageNKn4vaa	haha true. I think it's because you can prove one with your hands. But it would take too long to count all the stars. (I tried). |`|ERZPm3a3aa	u can check if the paint is wet whereas you can't sit there and count the stars in the sky|`|nKuXLKEhaa	hhahaha, wait, what?|`|4fe8c2a785bd51d538d28798e8ac1b3baa	lmao <br>  <br>  typical enfielder lol xx|`|MaiEYBnoaa	Well, IDK, but when I look up I do c billions of stars?!|`|VxE46bSFaa	Because I'm not going to take the time to count all the stars!|`|SVef7bKCaa	They Want To Annoy You Dont Do THat Please !

JqqRFFsyaa	Dang! You stole my answer. Jimi Hendrix could count for both. Kurt Cobain as well. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Forgot the "Why do you think your right?" part. Anyway...<br>  Well James because of his energy and dedication to the fans. This applies to Dimebag as well. Also, Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain are great because, as some person beneath me said (forgot your name, sorry), they kill two birds with one stone (such brutality to birds!), and they not only pulled it off, they pulled it off well, and influenced countless other musicians. And that, my friend is why I think they're the greatest.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	For rock, the lead guitarist that is probably technically the best would have to be Steve Vai...at least from all the guitar work I've heard.  For a front man, I'm not really sure.<br>  <br>  Now, in blues, Stevie Ray Vaughan was definitely the best lead guitarist.<br>  <br>  In modern country, I'd have to say that Brad Paisley's the best lead guitarist.  For classic country, it was either Chet Atkins or Jerry Reed.<br>  <br>  In jazz, Django Reinhardt was one of the all-time greatest lead guitarists...and he did it all with just two fingers!<br>  <br>  <br>  And, honestly--if you have not heard any of the guitarists I've mentioned, check out some of their stuff!  If you do, you will not be disappointed!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  I forgot to say why so, here goes...for Vai, it's because he's got to be one of the most advanced guitarists out there.  For Paisley, his speed and versatility is outstanding.  For Atkins and Reed alike, they were the two best fingerpickers I've ever heard and Atkins was one of the most influential country pickers of all time, if not the most influential country guitarist, that is.  Then, for SRV, I don't really need a reason...I mean, he was SRV!  For Django Reinhardt, you gotta listen to him and you'll know what I mean!|`|nhk5zzaeaa	Freddie Mercury no argument there.  Brian May. No Argument whatsoever.  Brian is a true virtuoso. And Freddie is a genious.

Why should you care what anyone thinks, it is your music, not ours.|`|W0Wk89Iaaa	I listen to a lot of bands that people seem to hate just because they're mainstream. It's fine to not like a band because you don't like the music but its not acceptable to force your opinion on others or to not like a band because its cool to not like "cool" bands. The one exception is when people stop caring about the music and just keep saying how "hawt" their favorite boy band member is.<br>  EDIT: wow, i managed to get through that without saying Jonas Brothers Suck.<br>  EDIT: wait a second.............D**mn it|`|vEnmF72Xaa	People that bash Jonas Brothers on here...I repeat all you are doing is giving them more publicity. I do not even consider them a band and have never even heard a Jonas Brothers song, so why do people bash them all the time? Just forget about them and let them go and they will vanish...It's you idiots always saying "anti jonas brothers" "jonas brothers suck" all the time that keep people talking about them.|`|k7jGZydJaa	I think people will always be self-righteous assholes.<br>  <br>  <br>  by the way, to whoever called death metal crap and screamo, death metal and screamo is not the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: lol brokenpuppet|`|AgQForcYaa	Okay, you're making two different arguments here---<br>  <br>  1. People who just flat-out bash bands they don't like are jerks. <br>  <br>  2. People who hate modern music are jerks. <br>  <br>  Sometimes we just don't like a band, all right? Especially when they keep getting crammed down my throat and have no talent. I will agree, some people are kinda narrow-minded by saying "All new music sucks," but geez, aren't ya kinda setting a double standard here, calling everybody jerks when you really don't seem to be nice yourself?|`|j7imnQ7Naa	what people mean when they say that is that there arent many real rockstars left to make good bands<br>  bands back then had great, legendary musicians and every song had guitar solos and bass solos and crazy lyrics <br>  nowadays, rock songs are just 3-4 somewhat good muscians who write crappy stuff that sounds the same and there arent any crazy guitar solos or riffs<br>  i agree with most of them... good music is dead<br>  seriously, the last really good band (in my opinion) was nirvana, and they were the 90's<br>  <br>  but we all have our opinions|`|8TdPaQrqaa	the music that I bash sucks I wouldnt bash it if it didn't suck<br>  <br>  The jonas brothers suck<br>  Nu-metal sucks<br>  bands like Paramore my chemical romance, Panic at the disco, and hawthorn heights and **** like that suck<br>  <br>  I dont like the beatles. They are a good band but I think that they are over rated but i dont bash them... there are alot of bands that I dont like but dont bash. I only bash crappy music...|`|6Ckkk3Lwaa	i don't know but it's getting annoying.<br>  people always get all riled up when someone is talking about a band they don't like, and start bashing the unliked band. then, when somebody gets upset at their favorite group, they get all upset because they're bashing them.<br>  seriously now. music is music. it has a beat. it has a singer. it has instruments. it makes people happy. isn't that important?<br>  stop acting like little babies and just skip over the bands you don't like.<br>  gahhh!<br>  thanks =]|`|KNcgucRgaa	well, actually just because people bash other bands doesnt give u the right to call them "self righteous assholes". i agree with you though, that people should be open minded but if they dont like it they dont like it...its called freedom of speech...maybe YOU should shut up.|`|vAqcVR5Jaa	There are some good bands, and I'm open to a lot of stuff, but there is some shite that I will just not put up with:<br>  <br>  -miley cyrus/hannah montana (there's no difference)<br>  -jonas brothers<br>  -fall out boy<br>  -my chemical romance<br>  -pretty much all death metal/screamo/crap|`|PF6yKkVDaa	it's like sports. you're not gonna say your team sucks and the other persons is good. you tell them what they like sucks and that yours is the best. not the way i think just trying to draw a comparison.|`|aNImzeYjaa	**** the first answerer<br>  <br>  I agree, I WISH PEOPLE WOULD GROW UP AND RESPECT OPINION|`|54kkWtqYaa	Never<br>  <br>  <br>  Holden: If the buzz is any indicator, that movie's gonna make some huge bank.<br>  Jay: What buzz?<br>  Holden: The Internet buzz.<br>  Jay: What the **** is the Internet?<br>  Holden: The Internet is a communication tool used the world over where people can come together to ***** about movies and share pornography with one another.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now replace "MOVIES" with the word "MUSIC"|`|t3DkRpK1aa	listen young'un. ill listen to whatever tickles me pink! nd if i decide to use my freedom of speech and bash the bands i dont like, then so be it. u are doing the same thing, by posting a question demanding us to shut up. and furthermore by telling us that we are "self-righteous assholes". excuse me but if u do not like us bashing bands i dnt think that u are right in calling ppl names. <br>  duh fuhh is wrong wiff you?|`|GMbuDoZaaa	It will always be that way. Everyone will always think that they like the best bands in the world.
OWXI806qaa	Well I was certainly upset about what happened to Bill, but it was a<br>  great hour. And I liked "Agent Renee Walker"s comments.<br>  <br>  I couldn't believe what that guy Quin did to Jack. <br>  What was that gas that he used? And did you notice that Quin was<br>  that guy on Redemption? The one who was torturing Roger's friend,<br>  Chris.<br>  <br>  Well I gotta run. I'll add more to my answer later.<br>  *<br>  *<br>  *<br>  *<br>  *<br>  Okay I'm back.<br>  <br>  One thing I really liked about monday's hour was what Jack<br>  said to Senator Mayer when he was butting in on their plans.<br>  "Senator, Shut up!". It was a simple phrase, but priceless.<br>  So from now on, I am going to refer to the senator as<br>  "Senator-Shut-Up".<br>  <br>  Predictions? Well, if you notice while you're watching the<br>  preview for next week, (and look really closely) <br>  Jack was with Tony. And if you look even closer, you can see<br>  that they are at some docks.<br>  <br>  Remember Hodges saying that  he had a shipment of<br>  weapons coming in? I'm thinking that Jack's gonna get to<br>  them. And also did you see Jack talking to Senator Shut-Up?<br>  What lead led Jack to him? Hum?<br>  <br>  Also did you notice that Aaron told Olivia that he would be<br>  cack on his feet in a few hours? It sounds like he's not done<br>  contibuting to the day. And then he was talking about Martha.<br>  I wonder what happened to her. I'm thinking that either she<br>  died, or was commited to an insane asylum.<br>  <br>   It's hard to say for sure exactly what's gonna happen, but<br>  you can tell a lot from just watching the preview closely.<br>  (I have it recorded so I can watch it as much as I want)<br>  <br>  And.....okay, just as warning: <br>  I'M ABOUT TO SNEAK A SPOILER!<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  Do you remember Frank Tramell from Redemption?<br>  (the jerk who subpoenaed Jack) <a href="http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Redemption" rel="nofollow">http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Redemption</a><br>  He is going to be returning sometime in the course of this<br>  season. So that should be interesting.<br>  <br>  Well, I actually have some more spoilers, but if you want to <br>  know you'll have to email me & ask for them.<br>  I get yelled at sometimes for posting spoilers, so I'm trying<br>  be careful with them.<br>  <br>  I hope I could help. Happy watching!|`|dyv2sqtxaa	I think Renee will find Jack and help him. The old man that works for the president, I'm guessing is bad. And that old man working in the office waiting for the 'package', he is a terrorist and I think he is the new leader now that Debuacco and that other guy are dead. He said something about weapons too. Oh yea, and do we know anything about the president's husband? I haven't heard anything about him yet... I think he will recover unless they've already said his condition. <br>  <br>  I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24! I LOVE 24!

Chloe's going to get in big trouble, Morris is probably going to help mess things up and I think Renee has a thing for Jack, ha ha.

yhqa5FIXaa	The Who, I like every single freaking song they ever did. But it is a really close tie with The Animals because they really spoke to a generation.<br>  <br>  The Who and The Animals are gods of rock and deserve all the credit in the world for the songwriting, vocal ability and instrumental ability. <br>  <br>  THE WHO AND THE ANIMALS FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!! lmao|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Queen.<br>  <br>  -There isn't a never will be another frontman/singer like Freddie Mercury.<br>  -Brian May MADE his own guitar out of a fireplace.<br>  -Each and every song is unique.<br>  -They wrote Bohemian Rhapsody.<br>  -They rock and they roll.|`|3cfGSkAiaa	The Doors. <br>  They had such a unique sound and there has never been, and probably never will be, a band quite like them. Ray was an amazing keyboard player and really contributed the band's sound. Robbie's jazzy guitar playing also really added to their music. And John Densmore is one of the only drummers I idolize, along with Keith Moon. Jim of course was an essential member too. He was the greatest frontman of all time, and the quintessential rockstar. He was intelligent, talented, poetic, wild, and charismatic. You just can't beat The Doors.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Oh I've got love for The Who! They were AMAZING! As I said before, Keith is one of the only drummers I idolize. And as a bass player myself, I adore John. But anyway... I do love them. Just not as much as I love The Doors ;)|`|pZYScExKaa	I dearly love the Beatles-- but i really love the band YES<br>  They are so artistic--such beauty in writing<br>  They can take you on a swirling rollercoaster ride <br>  or hypnotize you in soft sunlight in a grassy field<br>  strong vocals<br>  lead bass guitar<br>  many members<br>  one glorious thread!!|`|lCWeznyKaa	The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith. Seriously do I need to exxplain why there great |`|WOMjtldKaa	Queen!!! They're the best!|`|3TGCzaE2aa	The Beatles<br>  <br>  They contributed so much the the music world.<br>  Their music is amazing, and I love everything about it.<br>  The lyrics are often mindblowing, and just so unique.<br>  They brought about change in the world.<br>  There is truly nothing else like the beatles.<br>  <br>  They were great people individually, very funny, witty, and intelligent, yet they seemed so laid back and nonchalant.<br>  <br>  George Harrison is my all-time favorite musician for so many reasons....that I could talk about forever, but to save my hands and fingers, I won't. <br>  ;)|`|qJpIh2iiaa	Led Zeppelin cause of their influence to rock music<br>  if any band today says that Led Zeppelin was not an influence to them then call them liars<br>  <br>  EVERYONE AND I REPEAT "EVERYONE " WAS INFLUENCED BY LED ZEPPELIN !!!!!!!!!

C7YbYUYPaa	Hard to tell really, but I think they would have been.<br>  <br>  Freddie Mercury set the bar at which every singer/front man needs to get to if they want to succeed.  Kurt Cobain mentioned Freddie as his biggest inspiration in his suicide note, so that means something.  <br>  <br>  Brian May is a very respected guitarist also, and I know that he influenced a lot of guitarists himself.  Slash said in an interview that Brian May was one of his idols growing up.<br>  <br>  Roger Taylor and John Deacon kind of get left out of this mix a lot of the time, but they have great influence also.  Deacon wrote some of the better Queen songs out there, and Roger Taylor mastered playing drums and singing backups, which is not an easy task.<br>  <br>  <br>  Freddie was still young when he died in 1991, so I think they still had many years of playing together, and could have very easily been mentioned in the same sentence as the Beatles influence wise.|`|jRUGj2fsaa	no because the beatles are such a comercial band making them popular for peopl eof all ages.... queen, even if freddy was alive, did not reach nearly as much fame as the beatles and probably never would have<br>  no one can be compared to the beatles|`|NiiuZng3aa	completely! freddie mercury was the man who really made queen what it was, and without him the band sorta faded away. whch is horribly unfortunate because they were so incredibly awesome and like no other musicians ive ever heard. but either way, i think the beatles were more influential becasue they were more world-wide than queen, and becasue every member of the beatles was a super celeb, but because they were so famous, they started to forget how they used to be and music became less and less mportant to them, but that would have never happened to queen because they werent so idolized as ndividuals|`|WOMjtldKaa	Yeah! Queen are the best!|`|lCWeznyKaa	THE ROLLING STONES OWNS BOTH|`|TlU3zj61aa	Maybe maybe not, but most likely yes.|`|RASqa0J0aa	Absolutely not.  Queen rocked but the Beetles was a band that inspired every muscial group out there is some shape or form.  Without them, music would not be what it is today.  Including Queen.|`|jvTAqHq9aa	Absofreakinglutely!|`|LZNotlzraa	THE BEATLES!  by far....................        and led zeppelin wins

He can howl and, well, shriek, but it sounds amazing. His vocals can be soft and tender, like in the Rain Song and All My Love, or they can be a bit harsher. He is a very versatile vocalist. And he is so good at conveying emotion through his vocals... his voice has made me cry a few times (but I do cry easily, I suppose). <br>   As for lyrics... some of their lyrics can be very beautiful. There are many innuendos, but I have come to not mind. But in songs like In the Light, the Rain Song, All My Love, the Battle of Evermore, No Quarter, Friends, and the list goes on... the lyrics are amazing (and really fun to quote). They can be very poetic. And lyrics like those in the Battle of Evermore and No Quarter always paint images in my head... And some of their song lyrics make me very, very happy, like in Celebration Day. Friends is kind of advice-giving... "I'm telling you now, the greatest thing you ever can do now, is trade a smile with someone who's blue now, it's very easy..." <br>   Oh, stop me now before I write about every single on of their songs! |`|WIguyGcZaa	Well, my favorite bands are The Beatles and The Who:) <br>  Vocals: Amazing, intense, and AWESOME at harmonizing.

F9Myq9bIaa	Laly est régulièrement insultée lorsqu'elle se ballade dans les rues (sale flic, grosse vulgaire, petite vicieuse...) donc elle essaye de rattraper une image en s'attaquant à Tatiana qui l'énerve car elle est plus belle et plus nuancée. Laly accuse Tatiana de parler de son viol pour faire pitié, ce qui est très grave !<br>  Julien à voulu se faire Tatiana ouvertement. Depuis il a réalisé qu'il était pris pour un veau devant la France entière... Julien accuse donc Xavier d'avoir une sorte de pute de luxe "à 150 000 euros" ce qui est aussi grave !<br>  Et Castaldi le "fils-de" sans aucun humour ni talent, s'est engagé dans ses commentaires contre le couple Xavier-Tatiana depuis quelques semaines. Alors il participe à ces polémiques comme l'adolescent attardé qu'il est, ce trou du fion pourri gaté... ?a c'est pas grave c'est insupportable !|`|3TE8lpwCaa	Je trouve qu'elle est méchante.<br>  Je comprends pas comment on peut tomber aussi bas dans un jeu de télé !

Tatiana et Xavier ont crée des affinités avec les autres tout ?a pour le jeu !! Ils ont pas aucun sentiment!! Y'a qu'à voir comment ils s'en sont pris à Maxime quand il a découvert son secret!!<br>  <br>  Alors que Laly n'a jamais été manipulatrice, elle a toujours été naturelle, même si elle était vulgaire mais au moins elle n'était pas hypocrite, elle était vraie!|`|5ff43290650a6152dc4dbec72e1080abaa	elle est comme ?a parce qu'elle est sortie du jeu! par contre, je ne la trouve pas jolie, loin de là, mais bon, chacun ses go?ts...|`|EZvkBZ0Raa	c une petasse|`|MHcIK05oaa	C'est qu'elle se plait dans ce role là... en tout cas oui, vulgaire et ideuse|`|MI2njqicaa	xavier a raison c'est une grosse merde je serai la mere de laly j'orai honte d'avoir une fille comme sa.|`|O1JDvjhcaa	Pas besoin de cette personnalité pour etre laide, elle a la gueule en long, à moitié de travers et en plus on dirait qu'elle louche.|`|OzC40oJoaa	certes elle a tous ces défaut mais elle n'est pas autant détestable que les thénardiers qui sont hypocrite, avide de l'argent, manipulateurs, menteurs...<br>  <br>  le plus gros défaut de laly, c'est de dire et oser dire la vérité de ce que beaucoup pensent d'eux en regardant l'emission<br>  <br>  les thénardiers devront prendrent cela comme un avertissement et essayer de soigner leur image pour se sauver la face<br>  <br>  d'ailleurs je n'aime pas les thénardiers<br>  <br>  j'espere que les triplées et gabriel iront en finale et les triplées gagneront|`|XYr8Yuj8aa	C'est une peau de vache qui a voulu être flic mais malheureusement elle n'était qu'adjointe de sécurité. Donc pas de quoi fouetter un chat mais fouetter une Tatiana en direct devant la France, c'est une honte. Si elle avait vraiment quelque chose à lui reprocher, pourquoi elle ne l'a pas fait entre 4 yeux avec Tatiana ? Cela aurait été plus judicieux, il faut dire la vérité mais qu'à la personne intéressée.<br>  En tout cas, elle a un TOC la Laly, elle se tripote tjrs les cheveux, c'est énervant !

Ripeto come in un altra domanda, io alle medie ho avuto un insegnannte di musica fantastico, ho fatto tutti i corsi di musica (ho suonato la tastiera), e in 3 ho suonato al saggio finale e ho cantato anche.<br>  Poi tutto ad un tratto più nulla: al liceo niente musica.<br>  Non è giusto secondo me che non si faccia musica.<br>  Io continuo a suonare chitarra  e tastiera come sempre, però la cultura musicale a scuola secondo me dovrebbe essere obbligatoria, magari anche senza insegnare uno strumento, ma anche solo la storia della musica. Ma forse a quella ttroia della Germini gli si chiede troppo così: dobbiamo rimanere ignoranti in tutto e per tutto, così loro ci potranno usare come burattini quanto li pare. E' quello lo scopo.<br>  Comunque è vergognoso che in Svezia Finlandia Germania e molti paesi del nord si insegni la musica e in Italia no. E' vergognoso.<br>  <br>  Scusate per gli eventuali riferimenti politici.|`|Ez8oakwuaa	e il cinema allora???|`|EBFSNxG9aa	è una bella domanda. In effetti oggi la cultura musicale media di un adolescente è schifosamente bassa. Mi dispiace parlare con ragazzi (peraltro simpaticissimi) che non hanno mai sentito parlare di Keith Jarrett, di Mark Knopfler o di John Petrucci!<br>  <br>  Come ha già detto qualcuno, ovviamente non deve essere un'educazione che si ferma alla musica classica; anzi credo che quella moderna, in tutte le sue espressioni e sfumature, sia molto più affascinante e coinvolgente per un adolescente (senza nulla togliere alla classica, che io adoro).<br>  <br>  <br>  Comunque, con tutti i problemi della scuola al giorno d'oggi, mi pare che questo sia il minore dei guai. Però, chissà, forse un giorno qualcuno ci penserà!<br>  <br>  Ciao...|`|rOnOXSiDaa	perchè lo stato non ha i soldi per pagare professori di musica<br>  nè ha i soldi per fornire alle scuole le strumentazioni adeguate per lo studio della musica<br>  tantomeno il sistema scolastico italiano è fornito di programmi o orari o organizzazioni atte all'insegnamento di questa materia<br>  <br>  Purtroppo siamo lontanissimi dagli standard scolastici dei paesi Scandinavi...o Nord Europei in generale.|`|ImhNYmTJaa	Si, sarebbe carino!<br>  Ti accendo 1 stella!|`|Nma5LkxIaa	concordo assolutamente con te! fortunatamente io sono in un liceo linguistico e nel triennio studieremo musica 2 ore a settimana, e ci sarà la possibilità di scegliere tra vari strumenti tra cui anche chitarra elettrica, basso e batteria.

Oltre che un contenitore per dare soldi agli insegnanti. <br>  Altro che il metodo Montessori!!!|`|MIYNiCucaa	Ciao :)<br>  Beh comincio con il dire che in Italia(in una sorta di 1984 rimpicciolito) l'arte nel contesto(compreso arte e letteratura, studiate in maniera molto poco attenta e con un approccio "vecchio")rappresenta un modo per ampliare la menti e di avere un occhio più critico riguardo le tematiche sociali e non solo.<br>  Diciamo un occhio più critico in generale.<br>  Pensi che ai governi(destra o sinistra, in Italia non cambia molto)conviene che noi ampliamo il nostro bagaglio culturale e soprattutto le nostre vedute?<br>  L'ignoranza è la loro salvezza. <br>  In Francia ci sono milioni di scioperi, l'Inghilterra ancor di più. I dirigenti fanno quello che dice il popolo(per quanto sia possibile per un politico). Questo credo che sia derivato dalla loro apertura mentale, non dall'arte.<br>  In Italia se dicono 2+2=5, tutti ci credono.<br>  In altri posti no.<br>  <br>  Sono stata molto vaga, ma alle scuole medie mi hanno insegnato questo.<br>  Il mio professore collegava musica, politica, arte, scienze...<br>  Partiva dalla dodecafonia, finiva con Marx.<br>  <br>  In secondo punto. La musica non è guardata come arte, ma come un modo di divertirsi.<br>  Del resto da moltissimi giovani è recepita così.<br>  Anche da molti pseudo rocker moderni.<br>  Un modo per passare il tempo...un sottofondo della vita che non merita di essere studiata approfonditamente.<br>  La materia è vista solo come un'ora di gioco(come io vedo educazione fisica)|`|ovurSlzIaa	hai ragione... stellina accesa...|`|L4NnLf1saa	Concordo!<br>  Sarebbe bellissimo avere musica a scuola.|`|GZtjVP4Jaa	Me lo sono sempre chiesto..! io ora per studiare la musica mi arrangio con la chitarra, vado nella banda col sax e il basso faccio anche li da solo! ma credo che fare musica a scuola sia bellissimo! anche solo poter scegliere se farla o no, chi vuole la studia col pentgramma e tutto, sennò chi non è portato o non gli piace fa solo storia della musica che al giorno d'oggi è moooolto utile dato che c'è gente che non sa chi sono i beatles o i led zeppelin....! è sempre cultura generale pure quella! così come per il cinema... c'è anche qui gente che non sa chi è kubrik o fellini..!! da lapidare...! vabbeh, ottima domanda..! ciao ciao|`|24FcuowUaa	sono d'accordo con te...anche io vorrei studiare musica...ma solo certa musica...se c'è da studiare house, techno, pop, commerciale ecc. non mi piacerebbe...se si tratta di METAL, ROCK e PUNK...si e sono d'accordissimo con te.... |`|F2gs7sw9aa	veramente bellissima domanda!grazie di avermi avvisato su msn..io mi occupo di musica, anzi occupo è troppo..mi piace scrivere i testi e inventarmi le basi per poi formulare le mie canzoni..è piu che giusto quello che ci esponi..nel senso che oramai la musica è una delle cose piu diffuse al mondo e la conoscenza di quest'arte secondo me piacerebbe a tutti..molto piu interessante di tante materie che ci sono a scuola..ma ovviamente nn cacceranno mai matematica per far spazio a musica..ma penso che un'oretta o due si potrebbero sottrarre sicuramente a qualche materia per dar spazio a questa..magari un ora in meno di storia..dato che si vanno a ripetere sempre le stesse cose!LA STORIA NON CAMBIA!!!! nel senso che la seconda guerra mondiale rimarrà sempre quella..quindi la studi alle elementari, alle medie..e poi che noia continuare a farla..cioè si approfondisce meglio il discorso però il succo è sempre quello..quindi io penso che davvero storia sarebbe la materia ideale da, nn mettere da parte ma per lo meno far spazio ad altre discipline..altra materia interessante io vedo anche geografia..almeno so dove si trova una città ma ora nn esiste quasi piu!<br>  <br>  bella, bella domanda!!!|`|hb66R7fmaa	Stellina accesas ad una cosa che anche io mi chiedo da molto tempo...|`|4zA1G1J2aa	io l'ho chiesto alla mia prof di matematica il motivo per cui tante scuole alle superiori non hanno come materia musica e lei mi ha risposto :"se qualcuno vuole suonare deve andare a lezione ma non a scuola", e poi mi ha fatto un discorso dove il succo era "la musica non serve a niente ed è inutile non ti da futuro,è più importante la matematica" KE SKIFO di ragionamenti !!!!!!!!<br>  L'italia è tra i paesi con il più grande patrimonio musicale eppure a quanto pare  a pochi importa. <br>  una bella stellina per la tua domanda|`|ne1RBZypaa	...Studierei al massimo la vita di David Guetta e DJ Tiesto... :D|`|hUhm5eyoaa	concordo pienamente con te  ^^ |`|g82x32b9aa	Alle elementari e alle medie se non ti capita un maestro bravo non fai un cavolo di musica... è come avere due ore buche alla settimana...<br>  <br>  <br>  Forse non si studia perché crea molti problemi: per studiarla servirebbero molte ore e non ci sarebbe tempo per le altre... e poi immaginati un pullman che va al liceo con 30 chitarre: non ci entrerebbe più nessuno!<br>  <br>  Perciò si fa nei conservatori, dove c'è molto più spazio per gli strumenti e si ha più tempo per studiarla bene.<br>  <br>  Comunque la musica è importantissima, io amo la musica, ma a scuola non ho mai imparato niente di niente.<br>  <br>  Ciao!|`|66R3tK8Jaa	Ciao Enri<br>  hai ragione,si deve insegnare VERA musica nelle scuole!<br>  W Michael Jackson<br>  |`|NWaiWzEzaa	sarebbe veramente stupendo...però io direi che più che studiare storia della musica  (per carità, andrebbe fatta anche quella, perchè l'ignoranza di questi tempi spopola in un modo assurdo...)  andrebbero OBBLIGATI i ragazzi a studiare uno strumento... (chiarisco il senso di quell'"obbligati": credo che la famosa ignoranza di cui sopra porti la gente a rifiutare anche lo strumento, percui occorrerebbe renderlo obbligatorio sì, ma anche piacevole, per evitare che venga vista solo come un'imposizione)  molta gente suonando risolverebbe tanti problemi...dalla depressione alle difficoltà di inserimento nella società...percui benvenga qualche anima buona del ministero che si "illumini" e ci pensi su....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  io ne dubito...però sarebbe veramente la materia più bella da studiare...<br>  <br>  matteo il conservatorio, lo sai bene, non è aperto a tutti....devi essere un genio per poter entrare...se non hai mai toccato uno strumento te lo sogni...l'uica soluzione sarebbero le lezioni private...CHE NON SONO MICA GRATIS!!...ed è un'ingiustizia tremenda<br>  la musica, come l'arte, come la letteratura, come la religione e come le scienze è patrimonio di tutti..e non solo di quelli che si possono permettere il conservatorio....<br>  e poi la scusa dell'autobus non sta in piedi...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  purtroppo in effetti come diceva qualcuno sotto...lo stato non caccerà mai una lira....<br>  <br>  <br>  ragazzi perchè declassate la musica classica??<br>  è come dire no non voglio stuidare il cinquecento perchè è vecchio e passato da secoli...voglio fare solo il novecento...NO!! LA MUSICA CLASSICA VA STUDIATA PRIMA DI TUTTO!! E POI SI, CI STO, MA SOLO IN SEGUITO, DARE LARGO SPAZIO ALLA MUSICA DEL 900...SONO LE NOSTRE RADICI...VANNO CONOSCIUTE!! LA CLASSICA DA VITA A TUTTO IL RESTO, FONDENDOSI ED EVOLVENDOSI, D'ACCORDO, MA ALLA BASE C'E' LEI!!|`|9O3zIxXmaa	NON SI PUO OBBLIGARE NESSUNO A STUDIARE UNO STRUMENTO MUSICALE !!!<br>  <br>  Il motivo per cui suonare uno strumento rilassa le persone, diminuise la depressione e da piacere e soddisfazione è che una persona sceglie di farlo !! Se si imponesse di suonare uno strumento a chi non lo fa per scelta sarebbe solo motivo di frustrazione e depressione per lui o lei e si perderebbero TUTTI i vantaggi. Non è la musica in se ad avere un valore intrinsico più forte di altre passioni, è il fare bene qualcosa che ci piace e ci stimola.<br>  <br>  Sarebbe come obbligare tutte le persone a giocare rugby. O tutte le persone ad andare a pesca. Certo che queste attività fanno sentire bene chi le pratica, ma proprio perchè si tratta di una scelta.<br>  <br>  La musica andrebbe studiata in quanto materia artistica e culturale. Ma chiaramente il modo migliore per studiarla sarebbe far conoscere i periodi storici musicali, i grandi musicisti del passato e di oggi, gli stili musicali e cosa hanno significato nella storia dei popoli. Forsa la cosa più importante che si puo dire sulla tratta dei neri è proprio racchiusa negli spiritual e nell'evoluzione della musica nera. E la cosa più importante che si puo dire della depressione americana è racchiusa nei musical.<br>  <br>  Ma credetimi. Essere obbligati a suonare un flauto (o qualsiasi altro strumento) quando non si è portati ed interessati è assolutamente RIDICOLO E INUTILE. Non si impara niente se non che quando non hai diritti è giusto essere torturati e sicuramente si svilupperà un'avversione totale verso la musica. Ho amici che hanno avuti genitori che gli hanno obbligati a suonare uno strumento controvoglia. Il risultato è stato divestante; sia a livello di (giustissima) diffidenza e rancore sviluppato nei confronti dei genitori, che di distaccato disinteressato sviluppato nei confronti dell'arte, che di traumatica sensazione di impotenza e frustrazione con cui hanno dovuto convivere. Si perchè loro sicuramente avevano idee migliori su come sfruttare il loro tempo, magari la persona senza potenziale musicale che perde anni costretto a strimpellare malamente uno strumento aveva invece il potenziale di un nuotatore, di uno scrittore o di un'astronomo.<br>  <br>  Lo studio di uno strumento (così come la scelta di andare in aliante, di fare immersioni subacquee, di andare a caccia o a pesca, di giocare a baseball, di studiare cucina ...) deve essere una scelta personale basata sull'affinità, la propensione e la passione.<br>  <br>  Le scuole dovrebbero avere dei corsi musicali interni PER QUEGLI STUDENTI CHE VOGLIONO SUONARE UNO STRUMENTO. Finite le medie devono essere creati dei licei ad indirizzo musicale così come succede nel resto del mondo. E' assurdo che una persona che ha gia scelto la strada della musica e debba dedicargli ore ed ore tutti i giorni si trovi costretto a studiare materie specialistiche che non hanno alcun tipo di interesse per lui o lei. Ama la musica, passa 4 ore al giorno e studiarla e deve andare al liceo classico, allo scentifico, all'alberghiero, allo psico-pedagogico? E' assurdo !<br>  <br>  Inoltre la musica dopo il liceo dovrebbe essere studiata principalmente nelle università così come è nel resto del mondo, dove sia per la musicologia, che la composizione che la performance strumentale sono previste delle laure.|`|XPkZGdujaa	Hai ragione... io l'ho studiata alle elementari e alle medie c'era la possibilità di fare il laboratorio di musica che bello...poi abbiamo fatto proprio la storia della musica a me piace.... ora alle superiori non si fa nulla... meno male che c'è un accademia musicale nella mia città!|`|hkTUFBmAaa	Perchè non è dato agli umani contemplare la Musica nella sua interezza.<br>  <br>  <br>  Al massimo, ci accontentiamo d'un mezzo busto.|`|8KlrpBAIaa	Hai perfettamente ragione.<br>  Se pensi che nel medioevo la musica faceva parte delle arti liberali, in particolare quelle del quadrivio, ossia quelle discipline che rendevano l'uomo "libero"; la tua domanda risulta più che giustificata.<br>  Come tutte le varie ideologie, anche la musica è frutto di diverse coordinate temporali, sociali e culturali e meriterebbe di essere approfondita.<br>  La muscia è specchio della società.<br>  La musica è vita.<br>  <br>  Ciao Moonwalker!<br>  |`|AjE5HOnqaa	anche a me piacerebbe|`|pMHiF45Qaa	Ciao Enrico.<br>  Secondo me la musica non si studia come materia principale per motivi di vero e proprio "Tempo".<br>  Già proprio così pensa che già quest'anno, con gli anni scolastici divisi in trimestri non più in quadrimestri, il tempo scarseggia parecchio; In alcune scuole si fanno corsi extra-scolastici per studiare la musica ma non è come studiarla tutti i giorni.<br>  A me farebbe molto piacere se si studiasse musica sopratutto per imparare ad usare gli strumenti, a cantare ecc.. e forse un giorno nascerà un altro mito come il nostro amato MJ !!|`|VDLBJAgmaa	bè si,hai ragione<br>  io ho appena iniziato le superiori,e quando ho saputo che musica nn si faceva sono andata in tilt,perchè nn sapevo che nn si faceva,ma almeno la faremo il prossimo anno al posto di arte...ma cmq dovrebbero mettere musica come una materia scolastica fissa,perchè infatti anche nella musica ci sono stati miti,e bisognerebbe far conoscere ai ragazzi chi ha inventato la musica gli strumenti,chi sono stati i primi cantautori,sempre se nn gli hanno fatti alle medie...ma cmq per me dovrebbe diventare una materia facoltativa!!|`|JZdGXEgWaa	Sarbbe bello avere musica a scola...<br>  si si...utile e bello...<br>  bella prposta<br>  ciao<br>  saluti dal vostro|`|4JLjoWCoaa	Sai quando facevo le medie avevo un bravissimo prof. <br>  Ci spiegava sempre tutto ovviamente ci faceva musica classica e mi piaceva un mondo. Ma odiavo una cosa...ci ha insegnato a suonare solo il flauto e lo odiavo...ero acora piccolo e non capivo.<br>  Poi alle superiori quando ho saputo che non c'era musico ero stracontento...e ora darei tutto per essere andato ad un conservatorio invece di fare un istituto tecnico.<br>  Uff...cmq bella domanda stellina...ciao.|`|hTMZ534Taa	si infatti...solo al "magistrale" precisamente socio-psico-pedagogico puoi scegliere di fare musica|`|xiK2CQEHaa	Io odio la storia...<br>  eppure te la fanno studiare fino a quando ci crepi a scuola...<br>  non ricordo molto se non qualche data...<br>  adoro quella dell'arte e quella del costume che naturalmente ho studiato facendo scuola da stilista...<br>  e non trovo per niente una cattiva idea studiare anche quella della musica...<br>  anche perchè tutte queste materie si collegano tra di loro alla fine e sarebbe più facile memorizzare le cose secondo me...<br>  ottima proposta caro!...<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  |`|ZBssz6sQaa	a me piacerebbe, purchè non si studi solo la classica....|`|5n8k5YGcaa	Dipende dalle scuole, io ho fatto quello che oggi si chiama socio-psico-pedagogico e noi al biennio facciamo musica, che nel triennio si sostituisce con storia dell'arte, cmq musica è una materia fantastica che dovrebbe continuare per tutti i 5 anni di liceo...ha un potere non solo per quanto riguarda la parte sull'espressività, ma è anche fonte di grande cultura...<br>  ottima proposta!!|`|AErSQmr8aa	Perché i signori che stanno là al governo pensano che non ci sia tempo in questo mondo,in questa società per scambiarsi sentimenti ed emozioni attraverso la musica...la musica per loro è "CAZZEGGIO"....e davvero la pensano così.....la musica è un Hobby....preferiscono imbeversi di cultura CLASSICA,MATEMATICA;STORIA...e via discorrendo...MAMMA MIA CHE PAROLONI....e poi sbagliano verbi in continuazione....con la musica non si sbaglia invece..quelle so sensazioni!!!!! Cmq una bella proposta...complimenti...ovviamente na cosa o si fa o nn si fa quindi sarebbe meglio se si facesse tt e 5 gli anni!!!!    W LA MUSICA|`|HtI2UsM8aa	pensa che il mio prof (sia eternamente lodato) si è chiesto la stessa cosa e oora,all'ultimo anno mi ritrovo a fare dei corsi integrativi di musica classica e opera interessantissimi (per chi piace ovviamente)<br>  comunque dovrebbe esserci più attenzione per queste cose,fanno pur sempre parte di una buona cultura|`|IRl67oq0aa	perche ogniuno ha delle idee differenti sulla musica <br>  chi asclta rock chi no<br>  e via dicendo.

Appoggio la proposta, stellina!!  :)|`|hbzoyXm3aa	Io ero un disastro in musica... <br>  Odiavo quel ***** di flauto...<br>  Quando ho saputo che al liceo non si faceva musica....<br>  beh... Ho fatto un urlo di gioia!|`|3SeYxF4aaa	magari perché non e presa molto sul serio o xche magari alle medie insegnano gia le basi e quindi pensano che sia inutile continuare ancora ........ ma i veri motivi non te li sapprei dire....... ciao!! comunque molti non la vogliono come materia scolastica la maggiortà la trovano un peso

fSYDOxX8aa	One song from each of their albums? Tough, but I'll try:<br>  <br>  Queen - Keep Yourself Alive<br>  Queen II - Ogre Battle<br>  Sheer Heart Attack - Brighton Rock<br>  A Night at the Opera - Bohemian Rhapsody<br>  A Day at the Races - Somebody to Love or Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy <br>  News of the World - It's Late<br>  Jazz - Dead on Time<br>  The Game - Need Your Loving Tonight<br>  Flash Gordon - The Hero<br>  Hot Space - Under Pressure<br>  The Works - Hammer to Fall<br>  A Kind of Magic - One Vision<br>  The Miracle - Scandal<br>  Innuendo - Bijou<br>  Made in Heaven - Let Me Live<br>  <br>  BA: It's a Hard Life<br>  <a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=YFwOe0EPOJs" rel="nofollow">http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=YFwOe0EPOJ...</a>|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I truly don't think I can pick a favorite.  I always lean towards Bohemian Rhapsody if people ask, but I love too many of their other songs to pick just one clear cut favorite.<br>  <br>  MA:  My favorite is from the Wembly concert in 1986.  Right after they get done doing Another One Bites The Dust, Freddie starts to talk about the band and the rumors of them splitting up.  <br>  <br>  "Forget those rumors, we're going to stay together til we f****ing die, I'm sure of it."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0xsRgivU4M&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0xsRgivU...</a><br>  It is just chilling to me, because only a few years later it turned out to be true.  R.I.P. Freddie Mercury.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS:  Great clip Stone Cold Crazy, I've never seen that before!|`|nhk5zzaeaa	No......I've tried....It's not possible...there are too many greats...every album is garanteed to have pretty much all gems....<br>  <br>  BQ: I love all the Wembley stuff, but there is this clip of Freddie beginning to sing "Death on Two Legs" in the late 70's at Earl's court, and the croud is cheering super loud, and he goes" Listen to me lovies!!" ahh it's so great...and then he procedes to ask the audience if they would like to hear something heavy or something soft, in his own Freddie manner...it's adorible..... ha ha " I can do this all night"...<br>  <br>  I'll find it for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=MQX-U7tAepY" rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=MQX-U7tAep...</a><br>  <br>  Ahh, hes adorrible....love his outfit too...sigh....<br>  <br>  *I'll stop now  : )*|`|ulluAgHDaa	'39 has always been a fav with me -- love the line that goes something like  - in the land that our grandchildren knew, - haunting! and of course the all time classic Bohemian Rhapsody can't miss that one out - the clip must be one of the best known in the world.|`|R3oNViF8aa	At the moment, my favorite Queen song is '39 from A Night at the Opera.|`|8d5c8ad3d3a0dccca6a468f16eac20f0aa	No, I've thought about it, but there's far too many, they're all so great|`|bD4848dqaa	Every song is a classic, Queen are in a league with very few bands in terms of musical achievement and influence on music as it is today.|`|V2PONyUQaa	I Want To Break Free<br>  It's a great song|`|a0eb8458480038de7249bdcb5025b88baa	The Same here
LAhGRwU9aa	noone am sure audtionong for it now made my tape , today
u4eN9gbAaa	A Day In the Life - The Beatles<br>  <br>  I made our school bus driver wait to drive away because I wanted to finish listening to A Day In the Life...<br>  <br>  My bus driver has a pretty cool taste in music and he always is listening to classic rock stations when driving us to school.....and he looks exactly like Ringo Starr!<br>  <br>   I told him once he reminded me of him, but he got insulted because he said "Ringo Starr? That guy is about the ugliest guy I've ever seen"....<br>  <br>  He doesn't like me very much anymore.....|`|dTVdt3yvaa	almost any song i like. <br>  <br>  i have this weird need to have to listen songs completely, without pause or interruption. otherwise...i don't know, it messes everything up. |`|FQ5Y0T18aa	never too late by 3 days grace, I listen to it on the radio all the time. From Yesterday by 30 seconds to mars, I got back from grandma's house and listened to it in someone's house|`|JXDecYjOaa	Dogs or Echoes - Pink Floyd <br>  though they're both 17-20 minute song and only a 7 minute ride to school<br>  if i don't listen to the whole song without interuption (which is very hard) it throws my whole day off|`|gwzNktFeaa	Stairway To Heaven Led Zeppelin Best Song Ever<br>  |`|nU7yv87Vaa	Slow Ride by Foghat<br>  <br>  <br>  I *cannot* turn it off. And if I listen to the radio edit, I'm practically exploding until I get a chance to listen to the full version...|`|U8aXa8xEaa	Pretty much any classic rock song that I haven't heard in ages.  (usually 70's rock) Too many to mention, but the most recent one was "Like a rock" by Bob Seger.  <br>  <br>  Also worth mentioning, "More than a feeling" by Boston.  That's the song I have to hear on the first warm spring day of the year.  The perfect song to drive to in a convertible with the top down!|`|Io1aOqKkaa	A couple of days ago i went to history class after school to answer and extra credit question and when i finished i asked my teacher if i could look through his music libary, and i was very surprised because he had music from Nirvana.  I did't go until i listen to Smells like teen spirit.  <br>   <br>  Also a couple of Months ago i went to LA with my cousins who hate Rock,  they were playing some video game and listening to some Rap Music, but suddendly Don't stom believin by Journey started playing and i had to go running inside their room to stop them from changing the song.  I didn't go until the song was over.|`|iGCrZXTWaa	"Sympathy for the Devil" by the Stones. that's  my favorite song!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I can't leave the car until I hear the end of Bohemian Rhapsody.<br>  <br>  Any way the winds blooooows....|`|3cfGSkAiaa	anything by the doors

It may be a bit heavy for some tastes, but their music is very powerful and often very sad.  Try For My Fallen Angel or My Wine in Silence.  They are both absolutely heartfelt and beautiful.

srtoPxN2aa	All albums that were originally released on vinyl, and recorded in analog format always sound better on vinyl than they do on any digital format. The quality of the sound will vary of course, depending on your set up/turn table/system, condition of the LP, lathe cutting, or type of pressing/quality of vinyl used.<br>  This isn't speculation...this is fact.<br>  I have been a serious collector since the late 60s early 70s, and I have too many albums! (if that's possible). I have somewhere in the range of 30, 000 vinyl LPs, and <br>  6, 000 CDs. When/where do you draw the line between passion, obsession and insanity? Lol<br>  I am a self confessed vinyl snob. I own many CD's, but prefer the sound of vinyl.<br>  For those of you who are brainwashed followers of the digital age, I understand. The CD has so many conveniences that the record LP doesn't have, and we all know what those are. But, when it comes to sonics and overall quality of sound, so many are unaware of the LP's superiority over the CD.  <br>  Many people were won over by the CD in it's early days because they didn't own a decent turn table (and no, Dual, Sony, and Technics isn't my idea of decent), or their records were trashed (more often than not from a worn out stylus), or weren't aware of proper care/maintenance and or setup/alignment procedures etc, or just couldn't be bothered. Perfect time for the convenient CD to take over. I remember seeing people playing their LP's with a stylus that was worn right down to the metal, and they wondered why their records sounded so awful...Lol. Not to mention damaging the groove of the LP in doing so.<br>  <br>  Most of you under the age 35 grew up with CD's, so not fully understanding the advantage of vinyl is not your fault.<br>  You must decide, what's more important; the space saving, portable, indestructible CD (you can spread peanut butter on them you know)...or the almighty sound of a slab of vinyl!<br>  True, having a good high end turn table will enable you to hear music the way it's meant to be heard. These tables can range in price from $2, 000.00 all the way up to $100, 000.00!<br>  Dream machines:<br>  <a href="http://www.audiofederation.com/catalog/turntables/" rel="nofollow">http://www.audiofederation.com/catalog/t...</a><br>  <br>  The sound of records are a far more enlightening, authentic recreation of sound. Compared to the modern digital formats, the analog LP record, with its signal engraved in a vinyl disc, may look poor at first glance.<br>  However, do not forget that it's still the only medium (apart from the reel to reel tape recorder) that can contain the most complete and most structured signal providing greater dynamics, having the widest frequency band attainable, and the most refined detail over the entire audio spectrum and far beyond, which no other format can deliver.<br>  The analog LP is not restricted to 16 or 24 bits, and a limited frequency band (as in digital), but has 700 bits - so to speak - and the minute upper harmonics which digital formats are missing. The simple reason is that the original LP is analogous in nature.<br>  If your CD outperforms your analog set-up, then you do not have the right combination of components. In other words you forgot about "system building". There are some general and specific do's and don'ts. Here are a few:<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  - Look for voluptuous sound, yet well controlled, look for realism.<br>  - Look for a good, spacey midband.<br>  - Do not connect low efficiency loudspeaker systems to a 10 or 25 Watt tube amplifier or to a high current amplifier.<br>  - Match cartridge and arm properly.<br>  - Choose the right preamplifier to match the impedance and/or capacitance of your cartridge.<br>  - Take care of positioning your loudspeakers in the listening environment.<br>  - Follow your taste and ears.<br>  - Be well advised, but forget about the hype which surrounds so many components and is repeated by so many too often. <br>   <br>  Also, the human ear is an analog device, and wasn't designed to interpret 1's and 0's...the binary code used for digital.<br>   <br>  I have several hundred Krautrock albums on vinyl, and maybe around 200 of them I own on CD as well. I bought them for the sheer convenience, to play in the car, at the lake...etc. Compared to my records played on my table, they sound horrid. Even the so called "re-mastered" CD's of older album releases. More often than not, many of them are not "true" re-masters, but instead, tweaked up versions of the album (levels increased), giving the listener the false impression that because it seems louder...it must have been remastered. Even when they are remastered correctly, it's impossible for them to sound as good as an analog source...but still, they seem to do the trick for most. I have a high end Arcam CD player with dual Wolfson DAC converters, and it doesn't even come close to recreating the sonics produced on my turn table.<br>   <br>  If you are seriously thinking of getting into vinyl, I highly recommend a quality record cleaning machine. Back in the 70's/80's, there were companies that sold record cleaning solutions, that did everything but clean the record. You would apply this goop, and smear it around, without extracting any of the debris, which would then be imbedded within the grooves, and left to harden there for ever. This would cause pops/ticks, and other sibilance, surface noise, etc.<br>  These new machines that have been on the market since the mid-late 80's are what every vinyl collector needs, as they have powerful 16HP vacuum motors that remove everything from the vinyl after being scrubbed with a synthetic microscopic alcohol/distilled water soaked brush. Here's a few great cleaning machines. I own the HPI 17:<br>  <a href="http://www.vpiindustries.com/products_cleaning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vpiindustries.com/products_cl...</a><br>  I bought this 'Nitty Gritty' cleaner a couple years ago, and it's incredible:<br>  <a href="http://www.nittygrittyinc.com/Fi-XP.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nittygrittyinc.com/Fi-XP.htm</a><br>   <br>  These machines are an absolute necessity to my collection, as I have taken 40 year old albums that looked OK, yet had tons of surface noise, a result of mold, and or press release wax, etc. After cleaning them, they sound crystal clear. These days, new LP's coming into my home never touch my table without a thorough cleaning on one of my machines.<br>   <br>  Here's a few entry level VPI tables...the 'Scout' is an excellent table for the beginner:<br>  <a href="http://www.vpiindustries.com/products_turntables.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vpiindustries.com/products_tu...</a><br>   <br>  If you'd like to know of some reputable online vinyl dealers within your area, please let me know...I'd be more than glad to hook you up!<br>  <br>  **Edit - <br>  Oh...and believe it or not, vinyl is extremely resilient, and not nearly as delicate as some people might lead you to believe. None of my albums have these "nasty pops and scratches" that people speak of. 99% of my collection is in either 'Mint', or 'Mint Minus' condition, both visual and sonic grading...even my albums that are 30+ years old. A stylus travels at the bottom of the LP's groove. So as long as a scuff or scratch does not permeate the depth of that groove, they will not be audible. I guess persons that hear these "pops" and "scratches" only hear them because they are playing records that were not cared for, or they're using a cheapo turn table/cartridge, worn out, or misaligned stylus. The record cleaning machines I spoke of above can sometimes have remarkable results with these types of noise disturbances if the problem is debris related (which many times it is). If the problem is related to deep scratches caused by LP misuse/mishandling, then you're out of luck...unless you can find a nice replacement copy on eBay, an online dealer, or a second hand record store. <br>  <br>  Also, vinyl is still being pressed and reissued by many major labels today, along with newer labels like 'Akarma', and 'Sundazed', who have specialized over the last 10-15 years in reissuing old rock classics, and obscurities from the 60's and 70's.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	It depends on which medium it was mastered for<br>  how old, <br>  the group, <br>  the engineer, <br>  the producer, <br>  the "mastering" is VERY important!<br>  many variables<br>  <br>  clean records/vinyl, that are not scratched do have a nice smooth sound to them.<br>  CD's have better high end, sometimes better lows, (they don't have to be compressed, to fit in the grooves)<br>  if mastered properly<br>  <br>  they BOTH sound better than mpgs|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	Hi.  I don't have a preference for either but some albums do sound better on vinyl (examples to follow)  I love the warmth of the sound on vinyl it just seems fuller, but there are also a hell of a lot of albums that sound better on CD. <br>  <br>  BA1: For me personally:<br>  <br>  'Aftermath', 'Between The Buttons' (both Mono) - The Rolling Stones<br>  'The Who Sell Out', 'Live At Leeds' - The Who<br>  'Please Please Me' 'Sgt Pepper' (mono) - The Beatles<br>  'Planet Waves', 'New Mornin' - Bob Dylan<br>  <br>  Thats just a few.<br>  <br>  BA2: I don't have any on vinyl, can't comment sorry.<br>  <br>  Great question!|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	I can certainly appreciate everything Smiley has already alluded to when it comes to vinyl.  There's no way to miss that passion coupled with the fact that everything he's said is 100% true.  <br>  <br>  However, let me just say that I'm a LOUD and PROUD member of club brainwashed as it pertains to the digital age.  While there's no denying the head to head sound quality comparisons tests, there are several reasons I'm for digital.  One is my age.  I'm old for R&P standards.  Yet, I was still far too young to be buying records on a regular basis back when vinyl was the main medium.  Second is all about convenience.  The CD is just as it name goes by, that being "compact."  Imagine if your car had to have these giant slots installed for record compatibility.  There's no getting past the portability factor.  Third, CD's are much harder to scratch (although it can be done if you try hard enough).  Fourth, I like being able to skip tracks without having to guesstimate with a needle.  Fifth, whether we like it or not, the industry has chosen to make CD's the gold standard.  Now, if records continued to be produced for EVERY album in the same way as a CD, perhaps a different story.  But they aren't.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	CD versions of vinyl need to be carefully remastered, just as MP3 conversions do. The result is no better than the original remastering, which is why some MP3 conversions of old vinyl recordings don't sound right.<br>  <br>  Having said that, CDs take up way less space and are less vulnerable to ambient temperature etc.|`|ld1vh7nHaa	yes, cd's are more portable, but if you have a good turntable vinyl does sound better, especially old analog recordings. people "hear" in analog, not digital. if not remastered properly, many old albums lost something in the analog to digital conversion. <br>  <br>  for people my age it's probably more nostalgia. there was a kind of ritual that went with getting the latest album that made it more personal and connected. there is something sterile about sharing files, and playing a silver disc with no album cover or inner sleeve art. <br>  <br>  ba: i think csny's deja vu sounds better on vinyl|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I prefer vinyl.  Something about the random pops in them just adds the right sound to it.  I personally think the only way to listen to vinyl is through a big old system, and not just some small turntable, but either way the sound is just so classic and pure.<br>  <br>  BA: Most of the older ones.  I love listening to Queen on vinyl.  No digital readings, just sound coming straight through the record.<br>  <br>  BA2: Couldn't say|`|qThmcR1Aaa	CDs. I grew up in the '70s and '80s, and even then, I didn't like LPs. All of the pops and clicks, and they skip and stick and get scratched so easily ... no, thanks. The only good thing about them was the cover art. When I listen to music, I usually listen intently, to the details. The last thing I want is to be distracted by a bunch of white noise that doesn't belong. And I can't tell you how many hours I spent fiddling with the needle, trying to pull out skips in the grooves or keep some record from sticking.<br>  <br>  Warped albums were always fun, too.<br>  <br>  Not that CDs are perfect. They get rid of all the background noise, sure, but I've heard some CDs that are mastered pretty poorly. The first copy of Miles Davis' "Bitches Brew" I bought on CD was so muddy, I couldn't even listen to it. Fortunately, things have improved. Except that now, engineers remaster the CDs so loud that the music constantly blares at you. But I can't blame the CDs for that ... just lousy engineers who think loud = better.<br>  <br>  Anyway, back in the day, I usually bought cassettes. I jumped right to CDs when they came out. I honestly never saw the fascination with vinyl. How anyone thinks they sound "better" than a CD, with all of their nasty crackles and pops, blows my mind.|`|SDRYr30caa	i was too young to really appreciate vinyl but since listening to my father's old records, I have to say I do like the sound better.<br>  <br>  However, I'm still going to go with CDs based on versatility.  I'm always listening to music on iTunes or on my iPod.  I can buy CDs and put them on my computer and have them everywhere i go - can't do that with vinyls.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Vinyl. The sound is richer, especially for 70's and 80's Albums.<br>  <br>  BA: Nearly anything from the 70's. Most Sabbath albums would be good cases in point.<br>  BA2: Hells to the Yes.

I like the warm, not so crisp sound for a lot of the rock and jazz of those eras.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, for Symphony, the clarity of CD is unbeatable (unless of course you listen to Audio DVDs).  I like the ability to distinctly make out every single instrument in the pit.<br>  <br>  But fo rthe most part, I will giv ethe edge to CDs.<br>  Why?  Very basic and unemotional ( which is ironic when yo think about it, as music should be all about emotional choices) but CDS are more portable, more durable, and far easier to store.  Plus, I don't have a Vinyl Burner on my computer.<br>  <br>  And I liek burning copies of all my CDs, so that my originals (the ones I paid good moeny for) don't get damaged.<br>  <br>  Plus...

Vinyl sounds better, but having grown up with it, having to turn the dang thing over every 20 minutes just gets on my nerves. <br>  <br>  I still have ALL my old vinyl, tho... and recently bought a 'suitcase turntable' so I can play the ones I haven't replaced (yet!) on CD. <br>  <br>  Plus, you can't play a vinyl album in the car... ;-D<br>  <br>  So for me, it's convenience and portability over sound quality.|`|bFdqlM6oaa	Vinyl because it has character, I enjoy the packaging of lp's and I have many albums that are not available on CD. <br>  <br>  You can take the girl out of the 80's but you can't take the 80's out of the girl... ; )|`|ONWCXzUMaa	keep a long store short, if scratch and hiss, has a memory, and they also breath life in the music.<br>  take care.<br>  dave

Obama, the leader of the Democratic party, had to have the President recall him. McCain helped shoot down one of Bush's provisions that would put Henry Paulson into a position of unfair and unprecedented power. McCain doesn't screw up historical quotes like Biden and Obama do.<br>  <br>  Should I go on?|`|LWyGluUvaa	Obama. I'm excited that the first election I can vote in actually has a good candidate. I'm still sore over Hilary dropping out though, I really did like her, but I'm cool with Obama, I think he could actually bring about some change.

CJJTdjw6aa	Because he is going to turn out like every other politician. All the promises will go right down the drain in short order. Just wait and see.<br>  <br>  Also he goes against everything our country was built on!<br>  <br>  |`|FNwxcBPpaa	Because people think he's Muslim and has terrorist ties, which are both lies.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Some people don't like him because he's part black, and black people were slaves to America at one time. A lot of people were scared to ever have a black person in office because they thought that Americans would become slaves. That's also part of why immigration is such a big deal. People who are here can run for State Representative and could also have children here who may try to become president. Some Americans are worried that they will be treated the same way that they treated people of color after they realized what kind of torture that was. Some are just racist and have it in their head that black people should be slaves no matter what because that is how they were raised. I've heard from a few people that they are scared he will become president, then go back to Africa and try to take over America to save his own country. That's why people think he's a terrorist. They think he may try to get in so that he has control over EVERYTHING in America. If he were to control this country, he could help his own by letting them know our weaknesses. That, of course, is ridiculous, but is still what some people think. I didn't much care for McCain and Palin, so I voted for Obama and am very glad he won. |`|CS1bNLFYaa	oh well, he is racist himself, and i myself am not racist.. so ... and he doesn't even like our country.. he won't even pledge to our freakin FLAG! his priest tells obama that the world is ruled by "Rich, WHITE people" wow.. that is racist right there!|`|WhRiAeQ0aa	I LUV HIM-- ROCK ON!<br>  <br>  and yes im white lol avatar<br>  <br>  i agree they r racist |`|iE7nwMVnaa	Well, I don't care about them  :)<br>  <br>  I like him! Glad he won!|`|3OFxasXHaa	let's see, he calls himself black to get the black vote<br>  he calls himself half white half black to get approval from others<br>  he grew up and was schooled as a muslim aka terrorist<br>  he's a socialist<br>  <br>  and he has no business in power of anything|`|e6JRzlpRaa	Obviously some one likes him  --  He was just elected Pres!!!!!!!|`|iqZTP04Yaa	I like Obama!

One of the reasons why I do not like him is because he is an inexperienced liar.|`|ktTX6TlYaa	i dont think he is christian, he didnt do the pledge at one of the debate things, and he SUPPOSEDLY worked with an ex-terrorist.|`|gr0TvvYRaa	How does that make you racist if you don't vote for him. Doesn't that make you racsit towards white people.|`|VxE46bSFaa	I'm guessing they don't agree with his politics|`|STEtjMlfaa	brainwashing.

VTE5wUCTaa	J'adoooooooooooooooooooooooooore regarder cette série je n'ai pas encore vu la dernière saison mais sur le net j'ai trouvé les résumés et je trépigne d'impatience pour les voir!<br>  Cette série est génial, tous les habitants de cette ville sont un peut fou et j'adore, les dialogues sont tres intéressant et il est vrai que la relation mère fille de Rory à Lorely mais surtout de Lorely et Emily sont très intéressantes.|`|H3tS4vqZaa	j'aime pas|`|wseGdjg7aa	je tombe dessus de temps en temps, et c'est vrai que ca n'est pas trop mal. certes je suis d'accord avec toi, c'est "realiste" mais les dialogues le sont beaucoup moins selon moi, la mere et la fille se repondent toujours du tac au tac, elles savent toujours quoi dire, c'est hallucinant, elles n'ont pas besoin de reflechir qu'elles ont deja une replique prete a l'emploi, c'est ce que je trouve dommage, et qu'il n'y a pas dans les freres scott par exemple. (serie peut etre moins realiste dans son ensemble, mais avec des dialogues plus realistes)<br>  mais a part c c'est vrai que c'est plutot pas mal|`|xRaGyugTaa	oui elle bien !!!|`|9qDtP8k5aa	j'aime beaucoup et je suis en train e la regarder sur france 4 !!!!<br>  mais j'aime aussi les frères scott !|`|0ba8bba01c76732591fb9ce07f3fd27eaa	Oui je l'aime bien quand elle passer sur des chaine publics.|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	j'avais vu qqs épisodes sur france 2 mais la chaine la vite arr^té<br>  et je l'es redécouverte sur france4 et je dois dire que j'adore, j'essaye de rater le moins d'épisodes possible mais j'aime beaucoup car comme tu le dit c'est très réaliste et j'aime bien la relation mère /fille lorelai/rory et l'univers ets aussi trsè chaleureux, on voit aussi la vie de tout un village j'aime assez<br>  c'est une bonne série

xberqVjYaa	I think that you are too short (but, not fat) for the show.  HOWEVER, I saw a commercial that Tyra is going to have a top model show for those shorter than 5'7.  You should try out for that one and good luck!<br>  <br>  Next.|`|cnMk2jWAaa	Just to be brutally honest, they won't pick you.<br>  You are too short for it. (I watch the show a lot! and love it!)<br>  The girls for modeling are all like 5'10.<br>  The "short one" are 5'9 and one girl only got on the show cause she lied about her height cause she was  5'8''.<br>  Pretty much you gotta be 5'9 or taller. Sorry.|`|76hhm6Quaa	Obviously the previous people who answered have no idea what is going on, Cycle 13 of America's Next Top Model is currently holding Casting Calls, This new cycle you will have to be UNDER 5'7", they are doing a cycle of "petite" girls. I went to a casting call yesterday, I am 5'4" and 120 pounds and I think I am in excellent shape, I eat healthy and go to the gym about 4 times a week and I am a size 3/4. If you are taller than me and only weigh 114 you are skinny. Don't be crazy, you know you are skinny! Go to the casting call you never know what tyra is looking for, it could be you!|`|FghyJZC7aa	Go for it, but if you have to ask if 114 pounds and size 0 is too fat, you've got bigger issues. What size do you want to be? -3. I think being super skinny is way over rated. And no I'm not fat. I'm thick in all the right places. :) I did have 3 children though, so I'm doing pretty good.|`|s6pHbyLzaa	you're not too fat, but you might be too short.|`|5BMe5S1Naa	these people are stupid cycle 13 is for people under 5 foot 7 so sure try out lol|`|PskqcnLbaa	If you are a size 0 or 1 you are not fat, and you have problems if you think that's fat...|`|AV65vgQFaa	cycle 13 is leaning more toward the short girls actually.|`|vbxRAeSNaa	actually u are not to short for cycle 13 and people saying u wont make is not true because they only want 5'7 and under on that cycle..so good luck|`|lSiIvJnRaa	cycle 13 is going to have shorter women in it, so i'd say go for it.

BNrQSYwhaa	Learn to sing,Control your air before you try to sing more complicated Music which requires you to know how to use your diaphragm so you do not destroy your Throat.Start singing Slower songs like Megadeth countdown to destruction,Symphony of  destruction.Don't rush into it or your screw up your throat/injure yourself.Metallica and pantera's singers have many years of singing behind them and it would be impossible to sounds like them in less then a year I also recommend do not attempt to scream  till your 16 when your voice has matured and will not go through much further change.Once you get to that age You will be discouraged by social pressure/the difficulty of it when you first start out but don't give up it's a lengthy process which can take at least a year to get good at.Being in a band takes lots of commitment especially when your first starting out it's a pain in the butt to learn to write lyrics.Don't jump to getting a P.A till your serious.If you want to learn,Don't look at tools on youtube making videos about themselves "showing you how to scream" look at the air/diaphragm control videos on youtube and once you learn those it will be a piece of cake to learn to scream.I recommend Mellisa Crosse's "Zen of screaming" it doesn't teach you how to scream but more so shows proper breathing techniques|`|gcUBB0Gzaa	scream alot, I am a metal screamer, if you want the truth, you have to have your mic on high for people to hear you, if you are trying to sound like the stars and still understand what you are saying.|`|vqqPQXL3aa	How about you try doing karaoke and see what kind of response you get?|`|b6ba269a43ec6d03500679d084769059aa	If you really scream like they sound like in Pantera, then you'd develope a callus and wouldn't beable to sing good at all, infact it will stick with you your entire life and you'll have a painfully raspy voice.  There's a certain way to do it <a href="http://www.funadvice.com/q/how_do_i_do_screamo" rel="nofollow">http://www.funadvice.com/q/how_do_i_do_s...</a> but if you want to just sing, just practice DAILY, I do mean every single day.  In 8 months or so your voice will become powerful and your vocal range will be as high as it can be (that is if you worked hard to sing higher pitches)  get a vocal coach to help you control your voice.  Use vibrato (when your voice rings at higher pitches).  Know what is within your voice range, see I know better than to try to sing something from David Lee Roth or Axl Rose.

0l88fiUTaa	Well, they are opposites on the zodiac wheel(180 degrees  a part), so there is a saying that opposites attract...but that isn't always true...<br>  <br>  Most astrological websites that I have read say that Libra and Aries have a strong attraction/chemistry/high strung relationship when they first meet and then there is a 50/50 chance of it working out because to quote one website "You either complete each other or compete against each other. There is no middle way with you two: it is all or nothing."<br>  <br>  Usually, Air and Fire signs are very compatible and attracted to each other instantly.....because in theory they complete eachother. Air signs are active mentally and analyze/rationalize a lot, while the Fire signs are active physically, they are impulsive and bold and don't always think things through before they act.....so they balance eachother out(in theory).<br>  <br>  I'm a Libra and I fell really hard for an Aries guy and even though his boldness was attractive, his ego, selfishness, and impatience was a big turn off.....however even with all the negatives/and knowing that he is not right for me I can't get over him.... : ( Aries just have some sort of magnetism because they are such social butterflies/outgoing.<br>  It all depends on the two people, because every individual is different and every Aries/Libra is different too...<br>  <br>  As for a relationship with some one who already has kids: as long as you have no problem with it and are willing to accept that this person has children and therefore certain responsibilities(and his kids might come first) then I'm sure you two can make it work, lots of people have made it work in this situation(my mom and step-dad are an example and they both had kids from previous marriages).|`|B8R5wW66aa	Aries and Libra are an extremely good match....I only remember that because my first boyfriend was an Aries (I'm a Libra) and I remember looking it up and seeing that we were a very good astrological match.<br>  <br>  If you like kids, and like your partner's kids, it doesn't necessarily have to be hard. I know many people with children who have happily remarried and have a successful, happy new family.|`|AA10975334	I'm not totally into that either. Out of curiosity I tested to see what sign I was compatible with as an Aries and the answer is different each time. <br>  <br>  I am married to someone that has two teenagers, thankfully it hasn't been that hard. I've had to put them in their places a time or two, but for the most part, they are great kids. I think that the hardest part about being with someone who has kids is when the ex spouse is involved. That's tough, because sometimes it seems like the favoritism can lean towards the ex if they are still on good terms. I am fortunate to get a long with the ex. <br>  <br>  Every situation does vary. You just have to kind of get a feeling of what you are going to get into before really getting involved with that person|`|CqLDEvduaa	According to astrology Aries and Libra should be compatible.<br>  I'm a Libra and I always believed this was true, until I had an aries boyfriend who turned out to be a complete tool.<br>  Libra and gemini are better, if you ask me, most of my best friends are gemini :D<br>  <br>  As for the other question, sorry I can't help you there.

The show is set in an Asian-influenced world of martial arts and elemental manipulation; the series follows the adventures of the main protagonist Aang and his friends, who must save the world by defeating the Fire Lord and ending the destructive war with the Fire Nation. In the series' terminology, each episode is referred to as a "chapter", and each season as a "book".<br>  <br>  The show made its debut on February 21, 2005, and the last episodes were screened on July 19, 2008; it is now available on DVD, the iTunes Store, and the Xbox Live Marketplace, as well as its home on Nickelodeon. Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko co-created the series, and serve as executive producers alongside Aaron Ehasz.<br>  <br>  Avatar: The Last Airbender was popular with both audiences and critics, garnering 5.6 million viewers on its best-rated showing and receiving high ratings in the Nicktoons lineup, even outside its 6–11-year-old demographic. The first series' success prompted Nickelodeon to order second and third seasons. Merchandise based on the series include scaled action figures, a trading card game, three video games based on the first, second, and third seasons, stuffed animals distributed by Paramount Parks, and two LEGO sets.<br>  <br>  Avatar draws on the four classical elements common to most ancient philosophies (rather than the five classical Chinese elements) for its bending arts: Water, Earth, Fire and Air. Although each has its own variation, most ancient philosophies incorporate these four elements in some way: examples include the classical Hindu, Buddhist, Greek and Japanese elemental traditions.<br>  <br>  In the show’s opening, each element is accompanied by 2 Chinese characters: an ancient Chinese seal script character on the left, and a modern Chinese character on the right:<br>  <br>      * Water  is associated with "" (Chinese: ; pinyin: shàn), which means "benevolent" or "adaptive."<br>      * Earth  is associated with "" (traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: pinyin: qiáng), which means "strong."<br>      * Fire  is associated with "" (Chinese: ; pinyin: liè), which means "intense" or "ferocious."<br>      * Air is associated with "" (Chinese: ; pinyin: hé), which means "peaceful" or "harmonious".<br>  <br>  <br>  Avatar the last airbender only has three seasons, they are 'Water', 'Earth' and 'Fire'. They do not include 'Air' because unfontunately there is only one airbender left (aang) and it would be completely and utterly pointless to add a whole entire season on shredds.<br>  <br>  Hope this help you.<br>  <br>  |`|YU1Crvajaa	Avatar is still existing in Yahoo.<br>  Use the following link to login and create your Yahoo Avatar:<br>  <a href="https://login.yahoo.com/config/login_verify2?.intl=us&.src=avt&.done=http%3A%2F%2Favatars.yahoo.com">https://login.yahoo.com/config/login_ver...</a><br>

Ils ont, en plus, réussi à rester cohérents sur 8 saisons, faisant évoluer les caractères intelligemment, les intrigues sans s'emmeler les pattes, tout en survivant au départ de l'actrice vedette.<br>  <br>  Elle a conservé son aspect ado (pour plaire à ceux voulant des histoires d'amour en se moquant du coté fantastique ou en n'y comprenant rien) tout en développant un univers fantastique léger mais suffisamment cohérent, revisitant le mythe des sorcières (donc plaisant aussi, légèrement à ceux aimant le fantastique). Cette dualité est réussie sans atteindre la qualité de Buffy, évidemment.<br>  <br>  Pour finir, et c'est un signe de qualité dans les séries qui durent, ils ont réussi à faire une vraie fin à la série. Le dernier épisode est magnifique, cloturant toutes les intrigues en restant logique avec 8 ans de série (c'est assez rare pour le remarquer, combien de séries dites de prestiges sont incapables de conclure, genre Xfiles ou le Caméléon ...)<br>  <br>  Pour résumer, ?a reste une série légère, distrayante, tout en ne s'étant pas foutu de la tête des télespectateurs. Rien que pour ?a, elle restera plus dans les annales des bonnes séries fantastiques que bien d'autres.|`|6e718aee6a0cbf2fb96b25289f4eadbfaa	c'est une série que j'appréciais<br>  j'ai vu tous les épisodes<br>  dommage que ce soit fini, mais bon ?a ne pouvait pas non plus durer éternellement|`|e82a3a623135c74dc88a053774a448f3aa	J'aimais beaucoup mais comme pas mal d'autres, je trouve que c'est devenu moins intéressant quand Prue est partie|`|eb2a387ccc73736fdb4e222aa113333caa	Hello que du bien !!!! bye|`|59a1e50ab9a07d5fc78d9f6955c60c3caa	C'était sympa au début...Et puis ?a a vite viré à un défilé de mode, à qui aura le moins de tissu possible et sera la plus sexy...<br>  <br>  Je trouvais au fur et à mesure que le scenario était de plus en plus naze, et le budget malheureusement passait surtout dans la garde-robe, pas dans les effets spéciaux ! ?a en était risible !<br>  <br>  Bref, moi j'aimais bien les premières saisons, et ensuite j'ai décroché...|`|DTeKgqXqaa	Ben avant j'adorai, maintenant j'aime bien regarder mais je suis pas une fan.<br>  J'ai rater beaucoup d'épisode.|`|Z6LkQ2lDaa	J'ai adoré cette série, mais ils m'ont brisé le coeur quand ils ont éliminé Cole Turner, et en plus de cette fa?on là !<br>  Ils auraient pu le réhabiliter pour de bon et le faire se sacrifier pour sauver la vie d'une des 3 soeurs par exemple !|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	moi aussi j'adorais, j'étais une grande fan ...<br>  j'aimais beaucoup les soeurs ..., petite préférence pour Piper...|`|e42c69eaac0bf77920f3c95894119dd3aa	connais pas!

Ils sont à l'antithèse l'un de l'autre, on ne peut pas imaginer plus éloigné et pourtant, ils arrivent à concilier tout ?a et on ne peut pas imaginer couple plus équilibré. Ce couple c'est à lui tout seul, une le?on d'humanisme, de tolérance, d'acceptation de l'autre.<br>  <br>  Je les mets ex-eaquo avec Duncan McLeod / Amanda : un coupe qui dure plusieurs siècles (!), avec ses hauts, ses bas, ses trahisons, ses écarts mais toujours ils se pardonnent, toujours ils se retrouvent.<br>  <br>  Sinon, il y a les couples où l'un supporte sto?quement, sans jamais faillir, l'incongruité de l'autre (la plus belle preuve d'amour)<br>  - Jean-Pierre et Samantha (Bewitched) : imaginez à quel point il doit aimer sa sorcière pour supporter tout ce qu'il a subi (y compris la belle-mère !). Sans doute le plus grand amour de toute l'histoire de la TV.<br>  - Allison et Joe Dubois (Medium): sans faillir, il soutient sa médium de femme. Elle part en pleine nuit, n'importe quand, lui laisse les 3 momes, elle lui fait de tout et il est toujours là, au garde-à-vous. C'est la perfection fait homme.<br>  - Melinda Gordon et Jim Clancy (Ghost Whisperer): là aussi, il supporte le don de sa femme, il l'aide, la soutient, ne faillit jamais.|`|c83c97229b8c87edeab4783fc93e99eeaa	Piper et Leo<br>  Un couple magique : la sorcière bienfaitrice Piper Halliwell et l'ange de lumière Leo Wyatt ont déjoué les interdits et ont réussi à fonder une famille malgré la malédiction qui pesait sur eux.<br>  <br>  Phoebe et Cole/Balthazar<br>  Tout les séparait, et pourtant un beau jour, le démon à l'ame sensible est tombé éperdument amoureux de la belle sorcière<br>  <br>  bonne soirée|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	difficile de ne choisir qu'un couple<br>  pour moi buffy et angel, leur amour est fort, pur, il a traversé pas mal d'épreuves, c'est un super couple<br>  logan et veronica, leur amour traversera aussi beaucop d'épreuves mais au final on voit l'amour qu'ils se portent l'un à l'autre, m^me lorsqu'ils ne seront plus ensemble. j'adore ce couple<br>  le couple haley nathan  (les frères scott) aussi, un peu du même genre que logan veronica, le bad boy est devenu attachant quand il s'st mis en couple, nathan/haey c'est vraiment un amour très fort, ils ont aussi traversé beaucoup de galères mais s'aiment malgrès tout et forme un super couple, très beau<br>  <br>  voilà j'en est choisi que trois, mais il y a beaucoup de beau couple, de couple mythique|`|c342b829bc85ce7018ed0972215f692caa	Samantha Carter et Jack O'Neill !

H8XpaaPDaa	i have a line 6 spider 3, i don't usually get this. <br>  <br>  make sure that its not your strings that are buzzing. just check this by playing without the amp, if you still hear the buzzing, just bring your guitar in for a set up. if it only buzzes with the amp, i'd get it checked out if i were you. its not normal.|`|LkN5nr6faa	I bet the problem may be your instrument cable.

As a ultimate rock band you need to get at the basics of what Rock n Roll is. If you think of live shows. Bands playing in a bar for a Rock n Roll crowd here is what I picture. People drinking, woman dancing on tables, loud music, bikers fighting in the parking lot, funny smelling smoke in the air. With that picture framed I'll have to say from experience that the Roll Stones are the ultimate rock band. Test this out as I've seen it in action for over 30 years. Find a band covering Rolling Stone songs at a bar on a Friday night then stand back and watch the action.  You'll find the pure essence of Rock n Roll. If your looking for individual talented rock stars then you should have ask who you would put together to form the ultimate band. Again that is personal taste as there are a lot of talented people over the years. I've enjoyed each and everyone of them. |`|fLHV3pmuaa	Singer: Freddie Mercury<br>  Guitar: Jimi Hendrix<br>  Rhythm Guitar/backing vocals: John Lennon<br>  Bass: Paul McCartney<br>  <br>  I can't think of any drummers or keyboardists who are that good.|`|AA10795350	Thom Yorke (Radiohead) - Lead vocals, rhythm guitar<br>  Noel Gallagher (Oasis) - Lead guitar, vocals<br>  Tony Banks (Genesis) - Keyboards<br>  Mike Mills (R.E.M.) - Bass guitar<br>  Will Champion (Coldplay) - Drums|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Lead Vocals/Rythm Guitar - Doug Martsch<br>  Lead Guitar - Jay Mascis<br>  Keyboards/Guitar Johnny Greenwood<br>  Bass -  Matt Sharp<br>  Drums - Stephen Drozd|`|ppYrHJ8Haa	Matt Pike-Lead Guitar/Vox<br>  Troy Sanders-Bass/Vox<br>  Brann Dailor-Drums<br>  Jon Spencer-Theremin<br>  <br>  Professor Anger, that's the Pavement lineup!|`|2YHJZwksaa	Vocals - Lou Reed<br>  Lead Guitar - Jimmy Page<br>  Rhythm - Jerry Cantrell<br>  Bass - Eric Avery<br>  Drums - Neil Peart<br>  Keyboard - Ray Manzarek|`|FxX8O1BWaa	origional guns n roses<br>  <br>  slash-amazing guitarist<br>  axl rose-awesome vocals<br>  duff-real good bass<br>  izzy-good rythm and great songwriter<br>  adler-had fun with what he did and held the band together|`|01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	Singer-Jim Morrison<br>  Bass-Paul McCartney<br>  Lead Guitar- Danny Gatton<br>  Rhythm guitar-Joe Pass<br>  keys- Commander Cody<br>  Drums-Keith Moon|`|UwxdGCquaa	Singer- me<br>  Lead Guitar - my chinchilla<br>  Rhythm guitar- my iguana<br>  Bass-my angel fish<br>  Drums -my duck<br>  Keyboard -my butt|`|lCWeznyKaa	Singer-Steven Tyler<br>  Lead Guitarist-Slash<br>  Guitar-Brad Whitford<br>  Bass-Nikki Sixx & Tom Hamilton<br>  Drums-Joey|`|n0nT5rTCaa	Singer - Kevin DuBrow<br>  Lead Guitar - Zakk Wylde<br>  Rhythm Guitar - Izzy Stradlin<br>  Bass - Billy Sheehan<br>  Drums - Peter Criss|`|995e987f826f3705764c11398ede5b26aa	vocals -mike patton<br>  guitar -robert frippe<br>  bass-les claypool<br>  drums-danny carey<br>  keyboard-trent reznor|`|jmIdGUJ7aa	Singer / Rhythm Zakk Wylde<br>  Lead guitar Dimebag Darrell<br>  Bass- Frank Bello<br>  drums- Charlie Benante|`|bG7YxjRCaa	vocals: freddie mercury<br>  lead guitar: nuno bettencourt<br>  <br>  enough said|`|xwt2HR2Oaa	Pearl Jam

That was in the 70s.  Now people freak out about anyone dating someone a year older.  When did we become such a nation of micromanaging, judgemental prudes?  Maybe y'all should mind your own business instead of other people's.<br>  <br>  Besides, children's role models should be coming from their homes and communities, NOT Hollywood!<br>  <br>  Yeah, yeah, here comes the rain of thumbs downs *putting up umbrella*|`|hCI6HFEnaa	No way!<br>  And she's not even 16.

I hate Miley Cyrus... Shes so annoying. I wish shed like ... go away. |`|SsV2dcxwaa	i don't think so thats a 4 year difference plus why would a 20 year old be interested in a 16 year old????|`|bYfa7a4iaa	She started dating him when she was 15.  It's a felony.|`|NXcTnS9Xaa	well No but its her life|`|Nh2xYpiWaa	No she shouldn't. Now if she was 20 then whatever that would have been fine. At least by then she's an adult & it wouldn't be as creepy.<br>  <br>  & seriously what does a 20 year old want from a 16 year old anyways?<br>  <br>  Oh yeah fame.<br>  <br>  Stupid.<br>  <br>  I knew all along Miley Cyrus was going to be another Disney trainwreck.<br>  <br>  She's already more then halfway there. I feel bad for her fans.<br>  <br>  :)|`|1y84mVoMaa	no not at all she should respect her self and date her a boy that is the same age as her ------>16 not 20 years old next thing you know she will get pregnant by him in then what is she going to be a good role model for her fans i don't think so that is telling all her fan hey look at me you to get pregnant at 16 she makes me sick even my little sister said ewww she gross and sick for doing this she does not watch the hanna montana show any more cause of what she has done seiryklav |`|RzkbwWYoaa	i don't care... celebs are overrated snobs who care about nothing but themselves and money<br>  <br>  i really don't care what miley cyrus does, it doesn't afftect me in any way and she is no one special to me!|`|uPc8txAXaa	I don't think age differences matter, except when people are still growing up -- Miley and her boyfriend are on MUCH different pages in their lives, and thus shouldn't be in a relationship, at least not yet.|`|ELJ350DLaa	well it depends...<br>  like they say age doesn't matter...<br>  but in my opinion i dont think so shes so young.. and she's not even 16 yet she'll turn 16 on 23rd..<br>  |`|D4WStAycaa	No way!!  I would NEVER allow my 16 yr old to date a 20 yr old.  As for the 20 yr old - why does he want a 16 yr old???|`|RtwTdvTZaa	no! but its better than her going out with Nick Jonas!|`|FsYUBf6faa	No, but hey it's her life she's ruining.|`|1gE79V4Paa	Honestly age doesn't matter if they are in love than that is all that matters.<br>  And this is for Sarah yeah Miley is a role model to little girls but i don't think those little girls are watching TMZ or reading People mag or any of those magazines. You people are just jealous of her!!!<br>  <br>  All of you losers need to get a life and leave Miley alone!!!!!|`|IdJGQ1OAaa	Well, if Miley was not famous I guess it wouldn't have mattered that much but since she is.. I don't think she should. I mean seriously. Plus the guy is an UNDERWEAR model! I mean, Miley you can do better than that, I hope! Why didn't her parents let her date Jesse McCartney and let her date a 20 year old underwear model? |`|5euypCXNaa	As long as he respects her, and her father approves, and she's happy, that's really all that matters. 16 and 20 aren't too big in age range, all I would suggest is that they wait til she's 18 to move onto the next step, if it goes that far.|`|uTrvniALaa	No, it's inappropriate especially because she is a role model to so many little girls. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b68274_Miley__amp__Her_Man_Hit_Stephen_Baldwin_s_Book_Signing.html?utm_source=eonline&utm_medium=YA&utm_campaign=20081112104703AAdCHwv" rel="nofollow">http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b68274_M...</a>|`|qulBwHw0aa	her parents approve so why do we even care that should  be the only person worrying about the age difference!!!! they like each other!! whatever|`|Nt0xmFSgaa	Talking about desperate... |`|KOXwNdWPaa	NO!

70jNDiIiaa	Funny - I just mentioned this weird piece of music a few minutes ago in another question here - but I may as well "recycle" the information here for you!<br>  <br>  This singularly disturbing musical work is by the 18th century composer Heinrich Ignaz Biber - it's called "Operation for the Removal of a Stone" (a gallstone, presumably).<br>  <br>  It's a pretty scary piece of music - the narrator is accompanied by terrifying instrumental sound effects - the very worst one is when the narrator screams, "HERE COMES THE KNIFE!" (And don't forget, there weren't anaesthetics back in the 18th century...urghhhhhh...)<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen.|`|jbAr62ybaa	When Richard Strauss's opera "Salome" was premiered, it was considered extremely "weird"; probably a gross understatement.  Here's a few excerpts and you can easily see why.<br>  <br>       "The Dance of the Seven Veils"(two parts):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhbReUG84eE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhbReUG84...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJMMPJuDkQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJMMPJuD...</a><br>  <br>       This is the conclusion of the opera; Salome has received the severed head of John the Baptist, and proceeds to make love to it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxp9_BXILm8&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxp9_BXIL...</a><br>  <br>                                                    Alberich|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Wagner_A Faust Overture|`|f2ef10d3d131060a658a610b8e839133aa	Gnossienne No.1 by Satie is good|`|AA10125474	You know, we get tons of requests like this -- what is with this appetite for "dark, disturbing, depressing" music?  <br>  <br>  The last movement of Berlioz' "Sinfonie Fantastique" is titled "Witches Sabbath" -- depicting himself meeting his beloved in Hell.  It is filled with otherworldly tweets, the cackling of a high pitched clarinet, the use of an odd (at least for the time) string technique called "col legno", in which the strings are played with the back (the wooden part) of the bow.  Pretty eerie.<br>  <br>  The movement before is called "March to the Gallows", in which the composer has been convicted of murdering his beloved and is sentenced to death by guillotine.  The final passage is supposed to depict his severed head rolling down the steps.<br>  <br>  Dark enough for ya?<br>  <br>  If you want really weird and surreal, check out Ligeti's "Lux Aeterna"<br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|NJaZBgDwaa	Danse Macabre is definitely disturbing....<br>  Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D minor always seems creepy to me, but that is only because I associate it with Dracula, not because the actual music is eerie.<br>  <br>  I find a lot of Beethoven's music quite eerie. Particularly the Cantata on the Death of Emperor Joseph II, the second movement of his third Symphony, and Piano Sonata No. 23  (the first two are both in C minor- oooh conspiracy! I am joking of course! - about the conspiracy, but beethoven did seem to have an obsession with C minor!)<br>  <br>  Ponchelli's song Suicidio has always scared me, partly because of the meaning, partly because of the music.... it is one of the most dramatic songs, and oh so creepy!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Alberich, did you have to bring up Salome? I wont be able to sleep now! Ok I will but I will be so disturbed that I will have nightmares! Ewww! Great music, but its creepy, couldnt you have mentioned a nicer opera...<br>  <br>  On the subject  of creepy opera, some of Lucretia's arias in Brittens "The Rape of Lucretia" are pretty disturbing (I'm sure you can use your imagination, they arent graphic and dont actually say what has happened... if you know what I mean, but the implication is there.

jlqCDR0aaa	hey dollie (:<br>  i am a huge fan of visualizer! it is great to zone out with.<br>  visualizer is installed with itunes, it is not a separate program.<br>  i would suggest putting your library on a playlist you want to listen to. then hit either control T or command T [depending on whether you have a windows or mac]. that should start the visualizer.<br>  control/command F makes it full screen. <br>  just click out to exit!<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  xx

CwBVLFPTaa	Season 2 hasn't even begun yet. I know it's very confusing as many people have made this mistake. When the show aired in July 2008 they only made 11 episodes because they didn't know it was going to be such a big hit. Once they saw how well the public responded to the show ABC Family ordered up 12 more episodes. When the show ended the first time they where going back to film  the second half of the 1st season. The shows that are airing now are the second half of season 1. Season 1 ends with Amy having the baby.  Season 2 starts June 16, 2009.  I know that's going to seem like forever to me to wait until June for new episodes!!!|`|JSl1jAPQaa	i dont know, but i love the show!<br>  =)|`|KCqOTbBEaa	I'm not sure if it's definite that there will be a 3rd season....I LOVE this show though!!!!|`|ZFXTY7otaa	OMG I just realized that everyone who has said that the 1st season isn't over is right!

60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	Gotta think about that one...<br>  <br>  I suppose Birds could be one of them in that Tony Perkin's Norman's hobby was Taxidermy and there were those stuffed birds all around his office and in the newer version there were plenty of pictures of birds hanging on walls.<br>  <br>  Then you have the Director, Gus Van Sant, who like Hitchcock in the original, did a walk-on during the filming and appeared in the movie.<br>  <br>  Third could be the use of Blondes in the versions, like Marion in the original, Anne Heche was also a blond in the 1998 version.<br>  <br>  One other could also be the fact that the newer version of 1998 was shot for shot the same as the original as was the dialogue exactly the same.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	shower<br>  birds<br>  Norman saying "mother!"|`|36f84822e49a2b5137af715c3fe5087aaa	-the concept of freedom/independence (or lack there of) norman bates cant do anything for himself due to his overwheeing "mother"  eventually he tries to break away<br>  -the "nothing is as it seems" deal...like most alfred hitchcock movies, the ending is ingenious.  as a movie that was already very ahead of its time, nobody could have seen the ending coming.  also the girl wasnt able to realize in time what was really going on<br>  -karma-"what comes around goes around"- if i remember correctly, the girl stole some money and was running away with it.so she kindof had it coming to her<br>  <br>  i havent seen the movie in like 5 years so this is very hard for me to remember..(in fact im not even positive that the girl dies in the end)...but if my memory serves me correctly those are certainly some valid themes, but im sure i could come up with better ones if it was fresh in my mind<br>  <br>  <br>  edit-i assume ur talking about the old one as the newer ones are garbage and not worth looking into at all...

f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	If you mean etude Op. 10 No. 2, technically, this etude is one of the most hardest etudes, it is a killer, focusing on the figures 3-4-5, played very fast, I don't know what's you exact level, but you may not be able to finish it by this summer, it may require you about six months of continuous practice.<br>  Also, it is despite its extreme technical difficulty, it is not a showy piece technically and musically, it is just a technical exercises for gaining a very strong right hand.<br>  But If you mean the etude Op. 25 No. 2 , it is of course much easier than Op. 10 and also the Ballade.<br>  However , the ballade in all cases is the recommended piece,  it is a really showy piece technically and musically, and you have the time to be able to learn it perfectly.|`|jbAr62ybaa	I think you will find that there will be very few who would contend that the etude was more difficult - evaluated by a parameters - than the ballade.<br>  <br>       By all means, if you want to "impress", choose the ballade.<br>  <br>                                                    Alberich|`|AA12376180	I will assume you are referring to the opus 10 no. 2 Etude. The Ballade is the more difficult. The Etude is basically working one technique. Tempo was always the problem for me with this Etude.<br>  <br>  The Ballade really requires a mature musical mind. The Ballades are Chopin's most developed form and you will really need to think about your approach. It is much longer than the Etude and will not hold together for the novice.|`|kbFty6eVaa	By farrr, both technically and ESPECIALLY musically, the ballade in G minor is harder. Muchhh harder|`|dDOc608Raa	Since when do we grade pieces by their technical difficulty?

DocXfujAaa	There are only two studio albums by Paramore, but there are DVDs that you may be confusing with albums.<br>  <br>  The albums are All We Know Is Falling (2005) and Riot!

They aren't all by Paramore, but they have Hayley's vocals. Maybe they're from another band she was in before Paramore.<br>  <br>  These are the songs:<br>  <br>  Swim in Silence<br>  I Caught Myself<br>  Adore<br>  Another Day<br>  Just Like Me<br>  Hello Hello<br>  My Number 1<br>  Throwing Punches<br>  Rewind<br>  Circles<br>  Decoy<br>  My Hero (Foo Fighters cover)<br>  Stay Away<br>  Stop This Song<br>  Stuck On You (Cover, by I don't know)<br>  Breathe<br>  Temporary<br>  Decode<br>  Love's Not A Competition (Kaiser Cheifs cover)<br>  <br>  <br>  That list may have some songs performed by Paramore, but they could be covers from other bands.

Obviously she is not going to dress like Edita or Karina.|`|ClRuPRs7aa	No, it's not weird. She does look younger than her age but she's not 12. Her dress was nice, and appropriate. I know a lot girls her age who would love to be her right now, and wear all these nice dresses.|`|nrRFiuBPaa	think about it- shes been wearing gymnastics leotards pretty much her entire life. and most dance costumes are kinda skimpy. and i swear the people on dwts keep getting younger and younger. and shawn tripped down the stairs at the very beginning :P|`|X1uOh8ylaa	I loved Shawn, I thought she looked beautiful!

0brkUyGgaa	I suppose being high could make it entertaining. But it's absolutely not funny. It has the potential to be funny - the two actors are talented - but the format does not work. Seth Green and Seth McFarlane do a good job on this format, but these two actors don't understand how to make it good. I can say this because on the "Muscles for Bones" episode, it abandons that format, and we can see their talents really shine.

Some women are cute some women are sexy. Cute women look better in boy shorts and sexy women look better in bikinis. Now body type plays a role and how she herself feels comfortable matters also. If she's not comfortable in something it isn't going to be sexy. The woman makes the panties sexy more than the panties make the woman sexy.

It was announced last November. But that season will be the last one, at least for Lauren Conrad. And I doubt the show will go on without her. Plus, the other cast members have other projects that are in the works so I'm sure they won't sign on for another season either.
SOGkJSN4aa	One day they'll get fat and ugly just like all the other teen stars,<br>  and in the next 5-10 years they'll end up on the show "Celebrity Rehab" trying to get their career back.....After the show they'll record a new album and try to make a comeback just like the Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block did, but the Jonas craze will be over.|`|8oDAhb7Waa	Well, I hope they get erased from existence but when they're gone another manufactured band will pop up in their place. Hopefully they'll do something so stupid that it ends their career and ruins it for any other fake band like them in the future.

Not that I want them to have terrible lives I just wish they were not popular anymore because they really annoy me|`|kKOzl9nUaa	I think they will go into obscurity give it 5 years max.|`|gUuSmAZwaa	2 or 3 i say|`|RvnBuOROaa	once they hit puberty. so unfortunatly we have a few years to go.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	3 years tops.

If people would only listen to them and trust in them.  <br>  <br>  I like this poem a lot.  Is it about Jesus?  I stretched my interpretion to be about people who try to do good in general.  Often people with good intentions come under fire.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	Kind of bland. I suggest you keep your material to yourself (especially if you plan on selling your work).

i4QPLfEVaa	Heat|`|s19XuGlUaa	The Entertainer was the pay master. He is on the Gold Team. He had to send off either Buckwild, Heat or 20 Pack.  He knew he wasn't going to have Buckwild go home. The Entertainer had people in the house vote. They voted on 20 Pack staying and Heat leaving. <br>  <br>  No era lo suficientemente caliente. XD|`|vKFd6dPpaa	Heat|`|e7zXr9ozaa	Heat!!! Frank(Entertainer) had to do it and it was brutal. They put his 2 best friends on there and his gf on there in the box! Heat, 20Pack and Buckwild. So of course he wasn't letting go of Becky. So it came down to Heat and 20Pack and he let his teammates sort of choose. He called 20Pack down and then asked his team "Should I give him the check?" They all said yes. So that left Heat. And omg Heat criiiied like a baby. I felt so embarrassed for him. But he was pretty drunk so that's probably why he cried like that. He went out with one last "Calienteeeee!!!!" and told Frank he's the man.|`|lWUknox6aa	It was Heat.  I was kinda glad because I don't like the Entertainer's alliance.  THis season is kinda boring huh?!?  Last season had better people on it I think.|`|RncUc0traa	the entertainer was pay master but he let his team deside who must go home either buckwild( as so wanted buck wild 2 go) ,heat or 20pk. the team chose heat and heat cried like a baby lol den the entertainer promise he will get revenge on the gold team|`|OV0P8N7kaa	ENTERTAINER HAD TO CHOSE BETWEEN BECKY BUCKWILD, 20 PACK, OR HEAT.<br>  <br>  HEAT DREW THE SHORT STRAW|`|AOZvz2dpaa	Heat got voided and was crying like a puzzy|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	its was a huge dramatic moment but heat went home

jcanp9WOaa	Chuck Norris could get it for you.
zJoVm4SSaa	nope it was awesome. I would give it a  ten if they didn't change the ending from the novel, but other than that it gets a 9. It went straight by the book til the end, but it held my interest the whole time and the people i was with that didn't read it liked it too. Its got gore, action, sex, and everything into one damn good movie. go see it def worth it and if you don't like it, ah well its just 2 and 45min of your life. you will survive.|`|8ff45c0998366633e2e690fcdcdf5a92aa	Here's a link to a similar question...hopefully you'll find the answers helpful...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao7wjGbdM43GZHO0DrrBCpbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306223825AAPOPzU&show=7#profile-info-9ntoGPFyaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  ....you have to reaaaaallly want to watch the movie to be able to stay interested for almost 3 hours.......and don't even consider taking any kids to watch the movie, like some people did when i watched it - it's definitely not a kids' movie...I don't think it really lived up to all the hype, but whatever floats your boat i guess|`|1iR3rxeMaa	well its about 2hrs n 40 minutes actually... and i didnt think it was worth it... i mean... i went in expecting a superhero movie and i really didnt like what i did get.. i left the cinema half-way.. but maybe you should check out the plot because your opinion as opposed to mine could be different... some people did like it.. i guess i wasnt one of them though...|`|1H7MoHLtaa	An amazing adaptation. If you haven't read the novel then don't go in expecting X-men or Spiderman.  It's definitely not for impatient teens looking for a popcorn flick.|`|zWx6KRlJaa	I haven't seen it but my friend did and she said it was definitely not a movie to go out and see with the family. She didn't make it through the first 40 minutes. She said it had "adult content" like every 15 minutes.|`|0Y6igCkXaa	it wasnt all what it is cracked up to be.save some money and go rent it on dvd.|`|C8QTGBYxaa	it only came out now in south africa so dont no sorry|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	I saw it, and I certainly thought it was worth it... though I read the graphic novel before seeing the movie, so it helped me follow the story and understand the meaning behind it all.|`|AeJrpZGqaa	If you can get your hands on the novel, I would recommend reading it first. It's a quick read, and I'm very glad I read it before I saw the movie. It was an awesome movie. The intro montage is possibly the best intro I've ever seen (I'm a huge Dylan fan though). Really good fight scenes as well.
nRCqF6Euaa	A man that can hit you is less than a man. ( With the rare exception of genuine defense of himself or others )<br>  <br>  A man that cheats is guilty of being a man. ( Does not make it right )<br>  However when a man cheats it is seldom because he wants to hurt you.<br>  <br>  Hurting you with intent is always worse.|`|IgOGsKpCaa	Both can hurt someone very much, but not as much as physical abuse.<br>  <br>  Physical abuse is NEVER acceptable.|`|V29AonY7aa	Hits you. That could be extremely dangerous|`|BUe6hAK8aa	cheats.<br>  emotional pain takes lonqer tew heal.|`|PskqcnLbaa	Uhh hits you, I think the physical abuse would be worse.|`|JQhYc5DVaa	cheats<br>  it  can break ur heartttttttttttt|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	It's worse if he cheats.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	cheats|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Both have the underlying lack of respect for the other person.|`|AA10411486	Let's put it this way... It is worse for HIM of he hits me..|`|98yFxXi9aa	hits you|`|CS1bNLFYaa	If he hits you... O.o it's never worth that.

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	I recognized a lot of what I saw in the trailers (since I've read the graphic novel), so they didn't surprise or mislead me.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of parents didn't pay attention to the "R" rating and assumed that this would be another kid-friendly superhero flick.<br>  <br>  I bet they're kicking themselves in the butt now that their children have been exposed to blood, guts, rape, sex and complete male nudity.|`|capSLZQXaa	Wow! People are really obsessing over Dr. Manhattan's penis. It's not like he was doing jumping jacks throughout the movie or pelvic thrusts at the camera. His penis didn't have any lines. At no point was he walking around with a *****! He was simply naked. If it scares you, just never go to an art museum, get into the medical field, have sex, or have children and have to change a diaper(you'll find much worse things than a penis or vagina in a soiled diaper).<br>  <br>  The movie follows(with an exception being the ending) the graphic novel pretty closely, so many people could have read a synopsis to see what this movie would be like, and what to expect. The R rating for graphic violence,sexuality, nudity, and language(it even states so in the trailer) should have been the giveaway that this wasn't another "Dark Knight" or "Iron Man".<br>  <br>  Don't blame the trailer for not knowing what you were going to be in for ahead of time. It was all right there if you payed attention.|`|1iR3rxeMaa	ha!... i watched it expecting the same thing.. i mean from the trailer i didnt think that it would be the greatest movie of all time.. but seriously!!! i found it horrible!! i swear i fell asleep in the cinema and when i woke up it was still rolling... i think it was about the end but when i woke up.. i just left the cinema!!!.... i dunno about other people but i found it weird and i agree.. it is no superhero movie... i should seriously check reviews next time.. sorry to anyone who liked it... i don't mean to offend! :D|`|MpskWQAyaa	Well its R rated for starters, and the previews did mention something about it being NOT just another superhero movie.<br>  <br>  I liked it a lot by the way. Rorschach is one bad mutha*****|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	umm.......yeah it's called the watchmen. did you even read the graphic novel? hence the word GRAPHIC.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	I didn't find it misleading at all. It's not like they are going to show a part of a sex scene in a trailer.|`|PskqcnLbaa	Well yeah, that's the whole point of "Watchmen".  The 'graphic' novel is depicted that way.
VeU0vF1paa	That was Wonderfalls.  It was created by Bryan Fuller, and lasted about twelve episodes.
MAkEKCUfaa	All it would take is for the general public to demand quality music.  If Souja Boy continues to sell 5 million more records than say a KRS-One then that is what is going to be played over and over again on the radio, MTV, and BET.  Blame the record companies for marketing this crap like the Shamwow!|`|yoVF60ORaa	i read your question and was going to say the exact same thing as your description.  LupEND needs to have 3 or 4 smash singles, and the midwest//east need to solidify and expand the hold they have on the industry right now.|`|MAdFY7Vlaa	No everything is too artificial.it'll be hard to decipher the real from the fake.|`|khU8m4gxaa	I don't think I understand the question. Mainstream means popular, so whatever is on the radio is considered mainstream, and therefore, becomes popular through airplay. Lupe isn't the guy because I'm not sure he's going out of his way to cater to what mainstream radio is looking for. He has the talent, but I'm not certain he's willing to change his style for the masses.|`|DOShS8q0aa	what do you mean bounce back? Have you turned on your radio in the last five years? Mainstream rap (if you can call it rap, notsynthesizedd poetry) owns the radio and the media. I hope it dies so real rap can make a come back instead of having to remain underground|`|XctMTPisaa	Ok Mainstream rap has always been crap but when we liked it we were young and not experienced enough to tell the difference.  As we get older we realize it's crap but the old stuff is rooted to memories.  It's just called maturity people.<br>  <br>  EG..I remember saying hypnotize by biggie was commercial garbage pushed by puffy in comparison to songs like "what's beef".  I still think hypnotize is trash but i jammed it in clubs in high school so its kinda ok|`|1qUokeKOaa	lupe is one of my favorite rappers but it aint him his lyrics are on a hole nutha lvl dat sum ppl cant understand <br>  <br>  for it to change snap music wud have to stop <br>  and soulja boy wud have to die he started the hole revolution of rappers makin dance songs|`|uZQIUeyvaa	it will take more publicity for local and less known artists and a greater range of playable music besides the thug rand b one that goes on now.|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	yea...but lupe fiasco is only going to release another album then retire....
OuFI4ZxKaa	I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO GET'S FREAKING ANNOYED BY THAT CLINGY BOY!!! Ricky should go out with her. Not only is he cute but i like the way he shows his sincerity in wanting to be apart of the baby's life. <br>  lol<br>  but yea it's great how they have more actors with down syndrome in movies and tv shows now. It encourages ppl to know that anybody can make it.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I think it's so cool that they have an actor with down syndrome! Like, you would never think they would get a chance to act, but he did... I think it's really cool.<br>  God I want to shoot Ben in the head sometimes! It's like, go away, Ben. You "love" Amy, sure, well, you've known her for like 3 months and she's pregnant with Ricky's baby! Good god. It kills me sometimes, I swear. But I love Ricky. Damn he is fine. Lol|`|eV8QdNgVaa	Hahaha yeah it is cool I'm doing a report In English about mental retardation and I used him as an example<br>  And ommmggggggggg all my friends hate him she shouldve gone with ricky hahaha<br>  Much hotter<br>  And do you notice when he says I love you most of the time when she says it back she like yeah whatever I love you too haha

lpyWVR2oaa	I would think that a Mars in Scorpio native could become pretty obsessive with diving into the hidden psyche of life in general, with an intense interest in issues such as life, death, the afterlife. Also, there could be an obsession with dying the 'little death' through sexual merging and encounter, as what is known as an orgasm. <br>  <br>  This orgasmic explosion in the native is more than just sex; it actually has the ability to transform him/her at the very innermost core of the Being. Hence, the person might very well become addicted to sex and in particular, secret affairs.. and promiscuity could be a problem as well. <br>  <br>  During the sex act, there could be an intense drive to push beyond the limits acceptable to the partner as Scorpio is extremist in its attitudes. This could lead to sadistic acts during sex, esp. when Mars is afflicted in the chart. Also, because of the tendency to control and dominate, obsession (stalker traits), insane jealousy issues and paranoia are possible consequences as well.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	I have been told that Aries men and Cancerian woman are highly sexed of the star signs.These star signs find it hard to get on together|`|1p0cbDgnaa	Please tell us what the aspecting planets are.

My Moon is in Capricorn and it definately fits in a basic description about the sign.  I can be tough loving and still sweet, passionate but strong, I gues it's true that I'm kind of imbalanced in most ways but I have a very determind streak that gets me through anything.  My Mom is kind of like that,  though I was raised mostly by my Dad and that also is kind of Capricorn Moon-like, like it's opposite Cancer, in a Cancer Sun sign person the person may feel like they develop most of their values from the Mother or Moon. (can be either sex, but I've seen this in others Cancers I've met)  So..I really think it explains at least some what the "parental" dynamics in some way.  Some people don't even have a mother or father, that could also show in the sign + aspects in the astrology chart.|`|0l88fiUTaa	My moon is Virgo and My mom is a Leo....but she is a little neurotic, and needs to constantly keep herself busy: cleaning, cooking, or nit picking, and she is a huge control freak and not very understanding(can't view things from someone else's perspective). She has a big ego but she constantly likes to complain and point out her flaws even though she doesn't have them (secretly I think she does it to get compliments). But I don't think that she is very logical, her emotions rule her more and she is not a perfectionist. She is also very emotional and dramatic unlike a Virgo.<br>  <br>  So it looks like there is definitely a Leo /Virgo mix there,....but I don't know the other signs in her chart.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	My moon - Libra.  My mom has a Libra rising, and a Pisces moon.  Lots of Venus / Neptune influence there.  She never spoke ill of anyone and lived a world of denial of anything unpleasant.  Expressing any kind of negative emotion was an unspoken taboo.|`|jN29byxsaa	hmm...my moon is in Libra so I try to be a diplomat and see both sides of something. My mom is somewhat like that, but she tends to judge too quickly and act too quickly. But it's an interesting question. I have to look more into it.|`|LGFa6CKsaa	I would describe my mom quickly like this: She really equal and has high sense of justice, her motto and what she taught to me was to help other without asking nothing back and to be equal to everyone because that causes good karma, when you don't actually ask for it. Also she's really hard worker, she's been always working and was not often home when i was young. Classy, ambitious and humble. <br>  <br>  My moon sign is scorpio.. I once asked the same here i guess. I don't really connect my mom to scorpio (either she's asc scorpio), more likely to capricorn, which is her sun and mercury sign.|`|c6Rb8f3Gaa	Somewhat, but I think it's more accurate if we talk about the way that *I* perceive her. My Moon is in Leo, my mum is a Virgo. She's not by any stretch of the imagination a Fiery type, and I think that's mainly due to all that Virgo and Saturn energy in her chart....definitely what you would call a disciplined type (my Moon is in my 6th) and most of the times she's really level-headed (and when she's not, it most probably won't be known- I guess this has something to do with the Cadent house). She's, nevertheless, a very lively and industrious sort of woman, as long as her right of being respected and accepted for her real self is not encroached (and I think that fact is very much related to the Leo dignity picture)<br>  <br>  My Moon opposes my Asc and she has definitely played a major role in the way I relate and interact with others. She's probably the first person I've been so emotionally in tune with (there are times when she doesn't talk at all and yet I can feel her "moods" as loud as if I'm listening to a radio broadcast). And that very fact is probably ironic if you take into account we have an exact Moon opposition.  <br>  <br>  The only time we don't get along is when her Virgo energy clashes with my Jupiter forces....my Sag Venus and my 12th (my 12th house Sun is in opposition with my Moon). And that one is definitely a BIG time clash...<br>  <br>  but I guess I shouldn't expect anything less flamboyant having a Leo Moon myself, should I? :P

The French are the crazy ones for being to stupid to pay ransom for her. But if it wasn't for her herioc death there would have been no canonization for her.|`|56bNLJykaa	No, I haven't seen "Joan of Arc," but I have seen two better films; The silent film, "The Passion of Joan of Arc," directed by Carl Th. Dreyer in 1928, and French film "The Trial of Joan of Arc," directed by Robert Bresson in 1962. Both have to be up there for greatest movies of all time. In conclusion, her bravery and courage was greater than any other possible reasoning. In a way, she was ignorant, but lived til the death fighting for what she believed in- a true revolutionary.
LAhGRwU9aa	your right about melissa its a pity party  poor girl  its funny now wild cast|`|jh00NAj3aa	Do you consider Nancy O'Dell a star?  Or even Jewel ?  I thought Jewel was retired already.  If anyone has been in the headlines recently it's been Melissa.  Maybe the term "Star" is a bit broad, and on that point, I can certainly agree with you.  Honestly, anything that is topical that can add viewers to the show seem to be what ABC is after and they can care less if the people on there are stars or not.  I mean, when they start showing infomercials on their network on Saturday nights, you know they're in trouble and losing viewers.  So maybe having the crackpots and Lil Kim on there dedicating her dance to "her girls" in the pen, are the equivalent of adding a litter firecracker show on the sidelines to attract viewers to Dancing with the Stars.  So yes, you have a valid point, and I think it comes down to ABC wanting attention to attract all kinds of viewers, even crackheads and prisoners.|`|TYsw7TzIaa	Hey, they're there to dance and entertain, not to showcase their backgrounds. They aren't shooting up on TV, and it's really none of our business in the first place.<br>  Besides, there's no way one can be a good dancer and a drug addict. The druggies (if there are any) will be the first ones out. Believe me.<br>  <br>  As for Melissa, she's my personal favorite. She might not be a 'star,' but she CAN dance. That's what's important on the show.|`|HhR5b9Ivaa	I.m voting for Steve-O when I find out what number he was.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aot4aTHRkjImikuXQAnPIeYazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309221232AAq1M6X">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Thanks for the info.!

00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	I believe the movie is called Returner aka Ritana (2002).<br>  <br>  After an alien invasion threatens to annihilate the human race, a young Japanese girl, named Milly (Anne Suzuki), travels back in time from 2084 to October 2002, and enlists the reluctant aid of skilled Tokyo gunman, named Miyamoto (Takeshi Kaneshiro), to discover and prevent the start of the war. However, trouble ensues when the two protagonists are forced to deal with a Japanese mafia boss, named Mizoguchi (Goro Kishitani), who is somehow involved in the start of the war by keeping the first alien spaceship and its alien pilot captive, while our two heroes race against the clock to find a way to stop the oncoming destruction from the vengeance-seeking alien invasion fleet on its way to Earth|`|AA10898914	The movie is called "Returner". I enjoyed the film it had great special effects and action.

I always thought Jack had a certain air of loneliness about him.|`|sWvDZZ6Aaa	he was by far my favorite character in the movie and im guessing between him being the youngest and maybe he lived on the streets before that or was abused
76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	OK.  I am here to tell you to forget ALL the answers you've so far been given.  I'm going to give you the REAL DEAL on the most violent movie you can possibly see today.  And it outdoes, outperforms, outgrosses, out-Everything in the movies so far listed here. I am totally serious here.<br>   <br>  You want to see the most violent movie that will stay with you for months after you've seen it?  Here it is.<br>   <br>  Rent from Netflix the french horror movie called INSIDE (à l'intérieur)' (2007), starring Beatrice Dalle.  Make sure your whole gang is with you when you see this; order pepperoni pizza with extra sauce for everyone.   I GUARANTEE that they will all look at you differently after the movie is over.<br>   <br>  AND wait - there's more!<br>   <br>  On April 28th, Dimension Extreme Video is coming out with the DVD of another french horror film called MARTYRS (2008).  This is the one that even out-does INSIDE.  I'm not kidding.  This movie was so controversial, deemed so hideously violent, that it was Unreleasable in the United States.  At various film festivals, it literally sent audience members running to the bathrooms, or left them shaking & weeping in their seats.  And this doesn't include those who never made it to the aisle in time & threw up in their laps.<br>   <br>  THIS MOVIE left the director, Pascal Laugier, in the awkward position (when the movie was shown at European film festivals) of having to apologize to audience members!  And now, even the director says he hates having made the movie. This is not a joke and I'm not making this up.  <br>  <br>  MARTYRS has been called an "endurance contest" by film critics, and  that it makes HOSTEL look like BAMBI.|`|hAFxcxP0aa	Well this isnt scary AT ALl but i saw it once by acident:<br>  <br>  Wolf Creek RATED R<br>  <br>  this guy ties this chick up to a pole and shot her and rapes her AARHh trust me it was scary..<br>  <br>  <br>  wait no it wasnt..<br>  <br>  huhummm it when i used uhum bye<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?? bye then cya later mate cya soon cya mate bye mate cya catcha later dude bye mate :)|`|4qimEWgDaa	i don't watch violent movies... so prob something with Will Ferrel.

PCAlAoDsaa	There is this sales insurance agent who I love very much and he is a very hot, attractive, handsome and sexy man who has a great and fantastic body. His whole body is perfect and excellent in every way. His name is Robert C. Reisig.<br>  He is very romantic, respectful, kind, sweet, trusting, loyal, faithful, honest, loving, caring, charming, and a very hard-worker for the job that the does.<br>  <br>  Yes Aquarius men are romantic some of the time.<br>  Yes they do think about their past relationships.|`|to6JW3yFaa	Yeah they're pretty romantic when an Aqua is with u... not when ur apart. It's reallly weird cause when ur not with them, it's almost like u dont exist because they dont talk too much. But once ur on the phone with them or with them, then they shower u with attention.<br>  <br>  But yeah, they arent the type to talk about lovey dovey stuff and constantly tell u they miss u and stuff like that. But on the other hand, their actions make up for their lack of words. My guys paints me paintings, draws me stuff, and writes me poems. And he's also really affectionate when we're together alone.<br>  <br>  And yeah they definately do think about their past relationships. But it's not exactly in the way that u think. They dont think about them cause they cant let go of their last loves, they just cant let go of how bad things were. Like if an ex broke their heart, then they're going to remember it, and make it really hard for them to get close to anyone else.<br>  <br>  For example, my Aqua guy that I've been dating for the past 7 months is soooo scared of letting me close because his last gf cheated on him and then dumped him. Whenever I point out one thing wrong with what he does, like he flakes a lot, he gets upset that Im going to leave him. He believes that Im going to get tired of him doing that and dump him soon. And whenever I try and reasure him that just one flaw isnt going to make me stop liking him he says "well that's what my ex gf said before she cheated on me and then dumped me."<br>  <br>  Haha so THAT gets pretty annoying. I hate it when his past relatonships keep us from growing because Im not the same as his ex's and would never do that. So yeah... they definately do think about their past relationships, and how they relate to their current ones.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	They don't actually forget about their past relationships.  They are the type to just forget about romance alltogether because of the pain they feel it can cause them.  They like to relate on a mental level, then they feel safe to be with you.  they will find it easier and easier to distance themselves from you once you decide you've had enough of their games.  if you want to be with a good Aquarian, it takes a lot of endurance and compassion.  and Don't ever expect to be the center of their attention.  They haven't come any where near you for like three thousand years......  seirously!|`|AA10400874	They are romantic in their own weird ways.  They will get you movies that they think you will like, fix your computer, or share an idea with you.  That's how they're romantic.  Don't expect flowers and chocolates.  It's way too conventional.  Also, don't call them on their romantic gestures.  They don't like all the mushy-gushy-ness of it all.  They think about their past relationships a lot, actually.  While they want to see what's out there, there's something about familiarity in lovers that they like.  They may forget it for a while, but don't be surprised if a few years after you break up they just show up out of the blue with a whole "Hey, it's been a while.  How have you been?"  They usually like to stay friends with their exes.|`|4JRn0roWaa	I am aquarius and I think i'm pretty romantic at least my girlfriend tells me I am. And yeah I do think about past relationships sometimes that way I can learn from past mistakes.|`|QymdQMUZaa	im an aquarius girl and i find myself and other aquariauns to be oddly cold and distant, hard to love others. but easy to be loved

It all depends on where you will be playing. We tend to play 200 - 700 person capacity venues.<br>  <br>  You WILL need....<br>  <br>  Microphones, Personal Gear (amps, Instruments, mic stands) A PA system of some sort. What equipment you have now or will in the future dictates the number of channels you will need on a mixing console. I know a lot of bands that only use 12 to 16 channel boards. Due to our extra drum mics and Synths, we require a few more than most. You will need monitors, either in ear or wedges, Front of House (FOH) Speaker Cabinets, Power amps to match cabinets OR Powered Speaker Cabinets.  You can rent PA production from local music center or production companies. I would recommend you doing this at first until you learn what you really need. If you ever play a really Big Venue, you will likely have to use a professional production company. The larger the venue, the bigger the PA system you will need. Our system works well up to about 1000 people. After that, we would have to rent additional production. The bulk of you shows will likley be 100 - 500 person venues. I could write a 500 page book on this subject. You will learn over time time so don't worry. The people at your local music store will be able to help you. <br>  <br>  Click on the following link. It will download a basic PA guide in Adobe Acrobat .pdf for you. This will familiarize you with the basics.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yorkville.com/downloads/other/pabasics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.yorkville.com/downloads/other...</a><br>  <br>  After you get that, here is another one a bit more in depth.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yorkville.com/downloads/other/paguide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.yorkville.com/downloads/other...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps get you started. If you have any questions feel free to email. You can also find some good deals on used gear and scratch and dent stuff.

YNuyXl1waa	It was indeed Dorothy Kilgallen (a big-time gossip columnist in those days) who slurred her own introduction on a 1964 broadcast of the show (Bennett Cerf tried to cover for her with one of his routine bad-pun laden introductions of host John Charles Daly); it had been known within Goodson-Todman Productions and CBS that she had been struggling with drug and alcohol addiction on and off during the later years of the show (and driving Mark Goodson to the limit with her erratic behavior at times).

That way people can listen to them over and over on their ipods, share it with friends etc. Very effective way of spreading your sound.<br>  <br>  But if you really DON'T want to use the internet:<br>  <br>   - Hand out free CDs with the fliers (in a place where your target audience tends to gather so you don't waste too much money giving away free sh*t to people who will just chuck it away).<br>  <br>   - Does the band have a cool logo? If not, make one.<br>  Then you can do things like print up stickers and draw the logo EVERYWHERE (get people curious).

I can tell you that they probably won't show the sex and rate it R because they know that the main aduience is teenagers and if it's rated R obviously teenagers wouldn't be allowed to see it. Therefore the they won't make anywhere near as much money that they would if they don't show they sex. It makes perfect sense not to show the sex. They will find a way to show the audience that they had sex without showing it.  But it doesn't mean they can't show them making out or anything <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out!|`|7trZBxb6aa	yeah it's probably gonna be a really long movie. and no they are probably not gonna show them having sex but they'll probably show them making out and stuff. <br>  but we won't know for sure until the movie is made. :(|`|1o05hQ1Uaa	It'll be rated R, that's for sure.|`|h6znLMjhaa	umm with a camera?
ZyGyDLsDaa	I think it might be this series:<br>  Crossroads (1992)<br>  starring Robert Urich, Dalton James<br>  Series premise:<br>  John Hawkins is an assistant district attorney from New York. Things are going so well for him, he is being considered as the next candidate for district attorney. But things change when a friend of his from Seattle, the district attorney calls to tell him that his 16 year old son, Dylan is in trouble, and he is tired of letting his wealthy grandparents bail him out. He tells John that he plans to come down hard on his son unless he takes responsibility for him. It seems that John has had little contact with Dylan for seven years. John's an alcoholic who felt that Dylan would be better off with his grandparents, while he tries to fix his own problems first. John agrees to take Dylan and decides to take Dylan a ride on his old motorcycle and go around so that they can reestablish a relationship. Along the way they run into all sorts of people whose lives they get involved with before moving on.<br>  Here's a site for it though they don't have a lot of information:<br>  <a href="http://www.tvrage.com/Crossroads_1992" rel="nofollow">http://www.tvrage.com/Crossroads_1992</a><br>  <br>  If I recall, it completed one season but only part of the second. Actually, I might have this on videotape somewhere!
ZOkJmrWwaa	This looks like it might be Crossroads.  It was a short tv series back in the eairly ninties, only lasted one season.  You can find a episode guide here: <a href="http://www.locatetv.com/tv/crossroads/1359486" rel="nofollow">http://www.locatetv.com/tv/crossroads/13...</a><br>  <br>  I don't believe this was ever released to DVD, and I really doubt you could find it online.  Sorry.  It's just a little too old.  <br>  <br>  Although TV.com says that ABC shows repeats on Saturdays at 9:00.  I don't know if that's true or not.
ieS2q7Gcaa	they replay the episodes, watch on thursday before the premiere of the new episode. it was on lastnight but i didnt get to finish the episode.

mD7eAAoNaa	I'm a Virgo (sun) and I'd like to say that I am pretty irritable as of lately. Annoyed by an Aires and don't feel like seeing this person for a while, all their flaws are just glaring at me.|`|a1pmr73vaa	sun-scorpio<br>  moon-virgo<br>  But,I can be a bit of critical so...yeah! sorry..I can't control it.you ask.I answer.my duty.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh give me best answer<br>  <br>  thanks!|`|96jdzMmjaa	It doesn't. Its all a lie. The horoscopes (which, by the way, have absolutely no real connection to Greek astrology) are intentionally written to be vague, so your brain will pick up on any tiny trace of the ambiguous pattern in your life.|`|V5gELuFOaa	depending where you live, i blame it on the daylight savings time change. the "spring forward an hour" has gotten everyone sleep deprived thus more grumpy. it's going to take at least a week for everyone to get adjusted fully.

But u can find many flash downloaders, and if your movie is there, download more then just stream (do not do this on copyrighted videos) As far as finding specifics, best bet honestly is try youtube for sections by sections. ppl upload illegaly on there, and the video is taken down uselly same day, so u might find luck on joox better, as there movies stay there awile.|`|blvfPcNnaa	i just watched it a couple days ago at tv-links.cc & it was in good quality|`|PskqcnLbaa	surfthechannel.com or quicksilverscreen.com|`|WWCfdgd0aa	youtube?|`|rKSs8Wejaa	idk about you but surfthechannel.com gave me a virus not to long ago i think its safer to look it up in youtube!
hbUaDewPaa	Zeppelin is one of the greatest bands that ever existed, in my opinion, all this rap crap is far from the caliber of music that was released in the 70`s.If Zeppelin is satanic then there are no words to describe the s__t I hear on the top ten list today.|`|1UKr652Uaa	Jimmy Page, the guitarist for Led Zeppelin, is reportedly a Satanist. However, I don't think it's bad for a Christian or non-Satanist to listen to their music, as their lyrics contain no Satanic connotations or messages that cohere with Satanic values. I say listen away, man, that's some good stuff!|`|cYgxTWDVaa	If you do satanic stuff just because of that song(which isn't even satanic), then yes what you do is sinful. The listening part is not. Why the hell would listening be sinful?<br>  <br>  It all depends on how you interpret the song.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	No Zeppelin are a bunch of Geniuses like Beethoven|`|d4besXrYaa	No they are not satanic. Sinful to listen too arguably the greatest rock band of all time. You must be kidding. If you only heard the sh*t I listen too.|`|XfCGzHeTaa	Stair way to heaven backwards.|`|232e7ece2191695097ff2dbc049dd8a6aa	doesn't matter if they are, or not. do want you want. they are rockin'|`|rXMTdUg4aa	No....|`|hd16GLi8aa	There is no way that Led Zeppelin is "satanic" or whatever. Led Zeppelin's music is not about "Satan" or whatever religious people think. Rock is mostly about Drugs, Sex, or music itself, which is not Satanic. But Led Zeppelin is not religious, so why would they even care?|`|KTjMNiw9aa	for led zeppelin, i would be willing to burn for all eternity <br>  <br>  no there not satanic|`|YbmklSzGaa	They are not.|`|utTFiz3gaa	hmm...<br>  <br>  led zeppelin... satanic?!?!? i demand to know who said this to you!<br>  <br>  They aren't satanic as far as i know, you're fine....<br>  <br>  happy listening!|`|6jNBKvQGaa	There was some rumor that if you play Stairway To Heaven backward you can hear a satanic message.  I don't know if that's true and I don't care.<br>  <br>  People who say they are satanic are religious zealots who are afraid of freedom and free thought.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	No, Led Zeppelin is not satanic. You're fine, now listen to them if you want. Peace.|`|Qswzc6w7aa	No it is not. Like who ya likw, who cares what other ppl say or think about ya.|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	YES.. They are..

No offense, but I have never understood how they even got signed- I can't find one single redeeming quality about them. No depth, no musicianship, the guy has the wimpiest, most passionless, tuneless, and unemotive voice in history, TERRIBLE lyrics. They're just so flat and vapid.|`|HjwuB9I2aa	Yes. Maybe not hardcore, because I've only been a fan for a little while. <br>  <br>  But Love etc. is my most fave song. Downloaded off FW. :3

lpyWVR2oaa	Oh Wow, so much Airy element in your charts. This relationship will be marked first and foremost by intellectual compatibility and tons of communication. Both of you connect magically on an emotionally and even mental realm, because both of you share the same passion for the exchange of thoughts/ideas and are intellectual stimulation is also extremely important. <br>  <br>  In fact, the key to both your hearts is through intellectual stimulation. You are comfortable with each other's flirting styles as well as you give each other personal space and freedom at the same time. The ability to be attached yet detached at the same time give u both room to breathe. <br>  <br>  Just be wary of the tendency to intellectualize, rationalize and analyze too much, esp. when it comes to your feelings. Don't just talk about them, try to get in touch with the emotional realm as well.
BwEN0hWAaa	that's a good one..the most recent ones that stand out in my head are in superbad when seth gets hit by the car in the parking lot, or in pineapple express when james franco tries to throw his cell phone at a tree, but he misses and it goes flying into the woods (pretty much the whole scene in the woods). i don't know why but that part just cracks me up!!|`|LEoFTsvKaa	Bruce Almighty - news scene<br>  <br>  www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQOD7sqkmXM&fe...|`|3yNvgMvLaa	in benchwarmers<br>  where the kid is like ur still out and the guy is like ur still fat. <br>  haha. it sounds mean but u have to see it
zWx6KRlJaa	I personally am not sure. you make a good point though. But it don't think she had sex with jack because he has Duncan's sister for that. also i think that grace might still be a little to "good girl" to have done that yet, but i think something might happen with her to add a twist on the end on the season.|`|eKcrSr5zaa	no i dont think she is pregnant because of the way she was raised and because she has seen what amy has gone thru but i think she will continue to help and support ricky and amy|`|SFGNnKfWaa	doubt it.<br>  <br>  theyre already working annes pregnancy into the series (shes preg in real life)<br>  <br>  i dont think theyll make 3 ppl preg. thats just cheesy|`|6rNmAqXnaa	Sorry to say, but I don't think that Grace is pregnant. She's too much of a goody goody girl. And if she even had sex, they would have given us a little hint on the show. And she has condoms...she'd probably use them. But who would she have sex with though? The only person that she kinda likes (again) is Jack. And she's a smart girl. So, no, I don't think Grace is pregnant.|`|mzfas6ezaa	I am not sure if i think she is pregnant, but i do believe she is going to tell her mom that she and jack had sex or either their planning too.

76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	The last three STAR WARS movies were DUMB DUMB DUMB because George Lucas wrote them all himself.  <br>  <br>  He never accepted the fact that he was/is a really terrible, lousy writer. He can come up with exciting plots, but he has no discernable talent when it comes to writing good dialog or interesting characters/characterizations.<br>  <br>  The crazy thing is - he's so rich, that he could hire almost any writer in Hollywood to take his ideas and craft them into an excellent script. But his huge success made his ego grow to the point where he thought he really had writing talent.  And so he made the last 3 films, and we have all suffered in the process.  <br>  <br>  By the way, he didn't write the first-ever STAR WARS movie by himself. When he was done with the draft, he gave it to a really fine screen writer/friend of his and asked him to "give it some humor" and punch up the characterizations.  THAT's why the first film was so wonderful.  The second film, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, is generally considered the best written movie in the series, and that was written by several writers, using Lucas' ideas & plotlines.  Worked great.  <br>  <br>  If only he'd done that on the last 3 films.  (sigh . . . )|`|zovrJ0yXaa	george lucas decided to try and get political and turn star wars into a serious drama when it was always supposed to be a fun romp. he tried to use them as a political statement but he doesnt have the ear for dialogue to pull it off so it just came off as rubbish. also, he cast badly and noone really wants to see the birth of vader. hes best left being badass and unknowable|`|knKVjOE6aa	Personally I don't have a problem with them expect maybe episode 1. The reason why they are considered 'dumb' is because they are suppose to be set before the Original trilogy and they just look so shiny and too new to be set before the classic trilogy. Hope I've helped.|`|IDuA6JCxaa	Episode 1: The Phantom Menace was not so great.  Episode 2 was decent.  But I thought Episode 3 was back up to Star Wars par.  I really enjoyed that one.|`|8f264df90f04c294a122ee3032ed2541aa	It's not the movie, it's the viewers expectations of what is and what was not done. Don't blame the George, look inside yourself, don't let your imagination dictate what should have been done turn you into a critic when your not the one making, writing or directing the movie.|`|ARjkM88caa	yeah thats true, i dont know its dumb!|`|zBkaqIWcaa	George Lucas aimed again at kids, not at those kids who watched A New Hope and have now 40+ years old.|`|4Z0G5x52aa	Because all the hardcore Star Wars "geeks" have turned to other things...like videogames lol. But it's kinda true. The love has worn off for Star Wars from last generation, but now kids are its main audience. All the ones now are based on younger audiences.

So Mick packs the picnic basket with beer and sandwiches. The trouble is the picnic site is ten miles away so it takes them ten days to get there.<br>  <br>  When they get there Mick unpacks the food and beer. "Okay, Les. Give me the bottle opener."<br>  <br>  "I didn't bring it," says Les. "I thought you packed it."<br>  <br>  Mick gets worried, He turns to Alan, "Did you bring the bottle opener?"<br>  <br>  Naturally Alan didn't bring it. So they're stuck ten miles from home without a bottle opener. Mick and Alan beg Les to go back for It, but he refuses as he says they will eat all the sandwiches.<br>  <br>  After two hours, and after they have sworn on their tortoise lives that they will not eat the sandwiches, he finally agrees. So Les sets off down the road at a steady pace.<br>  <br>  Twenty days pass and he still isn't back and Mick and Alan are starving, but a promise is a promise.<br>  <br>  Another five days and he still isn't back, but a promise is a promise. Finally they can't take it any longer so they take out a sandwich each, and just as they are about to eat it, Les pops up from behind a rock and shouts..<br>  <br>  "I KNEW IT!

The bartender says "I hope you don't want blood, I don't want to give any more out." She says "That's okay I'll just have a glass of water." The bartender gives her a glass of water.

After a while, the artificial insemination man  arrives and knocks on the front door. Amy takes him down to the barn. They walk along the row of cows and   when<br>  she   sees the nail, she tells him, "This is the one...right here."<br>  The man, assuming he is dealing with an air head blonde, asks, "Tell<br>  me   lady,  cause I'm dying to know.....how would YOU know this is the cow to be bred?" "That's simple. By the nail over its stall," Amy explains very  confidently. Laughing rudely at her, the man says, "And what, pray tell, is the  nail  for?" The blonde turns to walk away, and says sweetly over her shoulder, "I guess  it's  to hang your pants on."|`|JGkYyIhJaa	So theres this kindergarden class and they just cam back from summer so the teacher tells the children that this year they can't use baby words. and then she asks for the children to talk about what they did during the summer<br>  a boy raises his hands a says" oooh let me go first"<br>  and the teacher says" go ahead"<br>  the boy says" i went to a farm and saw a oink oink"<br>  the teacher yells" I said no baby words"<br>  so the a girl goes"ohh let me go" <br>  the teacher says " go ahead"<br>  the girl says" i went to my granny and saw a woof woof"<br>  and the teacher yells" I said no baby words!"<br>  now annoyed the teacher picks one last boy<br>  the boy thinks and says" i stayed home all summer and watched Winnie the shitt"|`|9DIpVPl1aa	What does a pizza delivery guy and a gynacoligist have in common?

Then bought a CG Benge, played it for several years until I got my Besson Meha (plays like a dream).  If money is no object then maybe a Kanstul or a Monette.|`|BJms8gN7aa	Try getting a Bach Strad, go out and try every bach you can get your hands on.

In my opinion. Flat characters, and the first book's plot built up to a non-existent fight. It was anti-climatic.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter on the other hand has very well-developed characters with a bit more realism to them so that we can more closely relate to them, and also are just way more well-written. Even Stephen King said so.<br>  <br>  Note: I'm also talking about the books. Not movies. Though I rather like the movies myself, for Potter. The Twilight movie was worse than the book. Like way worse than normal adaptations are.|`|76imFZT4aa	Harry Potter. <br>  <br>  (Talking about the books of course, not the movies.

ZOkJmrWwaa	I don't think so.  If it was, then I think that information would be very easy to find.  Instead, when I search for influnces of Avatar, what I find is this:<br>  <br>  According to Bryan Konietzko, the program was conceived in the spring of 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged man and re-imagined the character as a child. Konietzko drew the character herding bison in the sky, and showed the sketch to Mike DiMartino. Konietzko described his and DiMartino's early development of the concept: “ We thought, "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland... and maybe some fire people are pressing down on them..." <br>  <br>  Avatar does borrow heavily from Asian art and mythology, in particular they borrow a lot from Chinese history,  Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism and Yoga. The production staff employs a cultural consultant, Edwin Zane, to review scripts.  They use many varieties of cultrial calligraphy in the show as well.  The show employs calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as a consultant and translator.<br>  <br>  The choreographed martial art bending moves were profoundly affected by Asian cinema. Western film series such as Star Wars, and literature series such as Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, were a heavy influence in developing the story of Avatar. In an interview, the creators revealed that they wanted to tell their own epic "legend & love story."|`|zaZibcGkaa	No, it is 100% not based on a novel Bryan and Mike came up with the show on their own.|`|894aXFYUaa	yes it is based on a book<br>  that why the series is called book 1,book 2 and book 3<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
76imFZT4aa	around July 17th-21st.<br>  <br>  You can search on the web for the release date. <br>  <br>  It was originally supposed to come out last November, but they pushed it back because the "Dark Knight" did so great over the summer seasons. <br>  <br>  I was counting down the days until it came out too! Then I found out in October they delayed it <br>  <br>  =[<br>  <br>  HBP is going to be awesome! I can't wait to see deathly hallows either. They're supposadly going to make it into  2 movies!
1UKr652Uaa	From the information on those pages, looks like the only difference is that the second one is the re-release, which, correct me if I'm wrong, is the director's cut which features some scenes that weren't in the original.|`|B43x5RF8aa	There are two version:<br>  <br>  The Exorcist <br>  <br>  & <br>  <br>  The Exorcist - The Version you have Never Seen (Includes footage not in the original)

37fchEXVaa	Wow !<br>  You really should get singing lessons to be a professional singer<br>  Really !!<br>  <br>  Probably you won't need the lessons XD|`|FY7NjgGnaa	some people like mariah carey have multiple ranges, where they can hit low notes like bass or alto notes while hitting tenor  and soprano notes without going falsetto|`|eda60a6a894beb349ddfd89a4c950beeaa	Lessons are in order.  Something exciting sounds as though it it trying to happen. It is far too early yet to decide what your voice will eventually be.  At the moment it sounds like maybe a  mezzo soprano, heading into an extended range, but this could change in time. (Mezzo means "in the middle", in voices, between soprano and alto.) Have a listen to Mariah Carey, Cecilia Bartolli, both  mezzos with spectacular coloratura ranges and see if you can relate to their techniques in any way.<br>  <br>  And no your voice is not "crazy" - try C (below middle C) plus 3 and a bit octaves.  I can sing all sorts of castrato, counter tenor, mezzo and lyric soprano stuff with no problems.  It did take a while, though, to find a teacher who believed it was possible and could help.<br>  <br>  Voices shift up and down, and/or extend out at one end or both, in time with training.  Lots of high voiced singers started off singing low, and vice versa.  With good training, yours will find its own level.

I would just say, if you are young, don't give up ever. Keep trying, but be humble that is what will get you far. I think that when you don't think of yourself as amazing, and you don't brag about your abilities, then you have time to grow into something great. I think that I was kind of like that, I never really thought of myself as good but I tried really hard, still do, and I audition, make mistakes but get better, and I still have room to grow, but people will begin to recognize hard work and dedication. <br>  I think there is a degree of being born with it. Because your voice may be trained like everyone else's but just isn't as pleasing to listen to as someone else's. But still if you love it, just keep working at it, and practice the right way, and that is all that matters.|`|A4OM6nI9aa	not everybody can sing but you dont necessarily have to be born with it. you can try to get singing lessons and you might become an alright singer but it'll take loads of practice and you dont know if you'll ever become an alright signer|`|WLYuDrlMaa	everyone can sing. it just depends if they are good or not.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Krull (1983)<br>  starring Ken Marshall, Lysette Anthony, Freddie Jones, Francesca Annis, Alun Armstrong, David Battley, Bernard Bresslaw, Liam Neeson<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  The planet Krull has been invaded by the evil monster The Beast and his army of The Slayers. Two rival kingdoms have formed an alliance as Prince Colwyn, son of King Turlord, marries Princess Lyssa, daughter of King Eirig. Their marriage will unite the two kingdoms, and both Colwyn and Lyssa will rule the lands of Krull. During the wedding, The Slayers attack, and Lyssa is kidnapped. Setting out to rescue her, Colwyn is joined by a fellowship of companions: the seer Ynyr; a band of escaped convicts led by Torquil; Rell, a one-eyed giant; Ergo, a cowardly magician; Emerald, a blind seer; and a young boy named Titch. They set off in search of The Black Fortress where Lyssa is being held captive and where The Beast intends to marry Lyssa in its evil goal to rule Krull along with many other worlds. Armed with a powerful weapon~The Glave, a disc with five blades~Colwyn and his companions set off in search of The Black Fortress which changes location every sunrise, where Colwyn vows to rescue Lyssa and defeat The Beast and The Slayers.<br>  <br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5dRkvsAkM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5dRkvsA...</a><br>  Here's one of my favorite parts~the Crystal Spider and the Widow of the Web:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2X7GIbALrI&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=470E03CE4853AE23&playnext=1&index=47" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2X7GIbAL...</a><br>  <br>  I was so lucky: I was able to see this in the theater several times. They expected it to be a huge hit, but people didn't seem to see in it what I and other fans did. They even made copies of Lyssa's wedding gown for sale!

AA10406285	It depends first of all on the budget of the movie. Another factor would be whether or not you having a speaking part. In my experience, however it averages between $70- $100 a day.<br>   Some independent movies ask for extras but pay them nothing other than food and snacks. People do it for the experience and exposure.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	$50-100|`|pd16sn5vaa	LOL! Being an extra in a movie depends where you live. In Albuquerque, NM it is usually 80 for 8 hours and anything over 8 hours is time and a half. after 14 hours, i believe, it is double pay.|`|bUDOZFDAaa	i met a casting agent once and they said it depends, some people do it full time and make a coupe hundred a day, but sometimes they only need people for an hour or two and they get like $50.|`|Am54ZEGBaa	I can only speak from my experience....my best friend was an extra in "across the universe".

Do you want to be an actor, director, producer or camera person? You really have to be passionate about it to make it in the business. Go to LA & go for it! It is worth a try.

87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	"Help, I'm Alive" and "Poster of a Girl" are both great songs. Check out "Calculation Theme," "Monster Hospital," "Gimme Sympathy," "Patriarch on a Vespa," "Dead Disco," "Handshakes," and "Too Little Too Late." Also listen to the song "The Police and the Private." It's my favorite Metric song ever.<br>  <br>  Their new album, Fantasies, comes out in April. If you look around on Google, you just might be able to find an early leak of it, but you didn't hear it from me! Consider buying it when it does come out, because it's a great album. I'm slightly ridiculous and pre-ordered the $65 deluxe edition of the album, which includes the CD, the vinyl, posters, and some extra goodies, haha.<br>  <br>  PS, if you like Metric, also check out The Bird and the Bee, Rilo Kiley, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, if you haven't already. =]

shKc7lZcaa	I'm always trying to pick things out like that!  Too funny!  I even pick out typos in books, lol.  (GEEK!!)<br>  <br>  "Medium" had a big screw up a couple of weeks ago.  I was having a TiVo marathon and catching up and watched 3 episodes in a row.  The first one had a scene where their oldest daughter was driving (with dad in the car) then the third epi was where he was teaching her to drive for the first time - LIKE SHE HAD NEVER DRIVEN BEFORE!  I went back and checked airing dates and it was accurate.  Maybe the writers forgot they already had her driving and needed "filler" stuff in that episode.  It was funny but definitely a major screw up!<br>  <br>  Fun question!|`|AaoclPYCaa	There are mistakes like that in all shows.  No show is perfect because they have to do so many different shoots to get it right then they splice them together for the end result.

71wBNgbnaa	Are you kidding me? I love them! A few years ago a friend got me into them, and the rest is history. He let me listen to "Tormented" and I remember he said, "If you don't like it, it won't hurt my feelings any." But I didn't just like it, I loved it. It was so different from anything else I listened to back then, and the more I listened to Staind, the more that I realized I related to their music. To be honest, Staind is the whole reason that I got into rock music in general. Before I heard them, I mainly listened to the top 40 crap, but once I'd heard Staind's music, I was completely changed, and for the better. They are one of my favorite bands, if not my absolute favorite. Their music has helped me through some really tough times in my life.<br>  <br>  It's great to see another Staind fan. :) Even though they're neither obscure nor overrated, they don't get nearly as much credit as they deserve.|`|F49y3gImaa	Maybe not more, but I do enjoy their music :)<br>  <br>  My favorite is So Far Away,<br>  but my second is definitely <br>  the well known, "Right Here."|`|sBpMpfTxaa	i really like their music, not a fanatic.|`|a895af3987d95b571fb54fe655ec725daa	Its Been A While|`|fJYReshoaa	nvr herd of them got any links|`|e1LCIzvzaa	No.<br>  Bad childhood experience.
vbim8H1Zaa	Don't worry at all because peter petrelli is still up and running in season 3 of Heroes. So far 19 episodes have been aired of the 3rd season.|`|F60JZOU3aa	Peter confronts Sylar face to face in an attempt to stop him at Kirby Plaza. Matt Parkman and Niki Sanders intervene as well, and Hiro runs Sylar through with a sword. Peter discovers to his horror that his own lack of control over Ted's ability makes himself the one who will explode, causing the catastrophe. Nathan arrives and flies Peter high into the atmosphere where the younger Petrelli forces Nathan to let go, and explodes. Immediately after the explosion, Peter flies up to and catches a falling and radiation burned Nathan<br>  In "Powerless", Peter and Hiro fight in Primatech, though Hiro is ultimately knocked unconscious. Peter helps Adam Monroe break into the Primatech vault, but he is confronted once again, this time by a revived Hiro, Matt Parkman, and Peter's brother, Nathan. After a mental struggle with Matt, Peter is convinced by Nathan that Adam cannot be trusted. Peter turns to find that Adam had already slipped into the vault. Peter runs in to see the virus falling to the floor. He catches it and destroys the virus. Together, Matt, Nathan and Peter decide to reveal what the Company has been doing. During a press conference, headed by Nathan, an unknown assassin shoots Nathan twice in the chest, preventing him from revealing his power. Peter tends to his brother as the crowd panics.<br>  Villains<br>  At the start of the third season, the shooter is revealed to be Peter Petrelli from four years in the future. In the future, those with abilities are hunted and killed, so Peter went back into the past to stop Nathan from revealing people with abilities. He seals the present Peter inside the body of Jesse Murphy, a prisoner of the Company.[1][2]<br>  <br>  Peter, still inside Jesse, is freed from imprisonment when Elle inadvertently disables the security system for the complex. Peter telephones Nathan in order to warn him about his future self, then follows the other escaped criminals in the hope of keeping them from hurting people. However, they quickly discover that Peter is not actually Jesse, and nearly kill him before Noah Bennet steps in. Peter discovers how to use Jesse's power (sound manipulation) and uses this to free Noah, but before he can finish, his future self removes him from Jesse and takes Peter to the future.[3<br>  In the future, Peter learns about the spread of abilities through the use of the formula and the fate that awaits the world if it isn't stopped. Future Peter tells present Peter that Sylar's intuitive aptitude can help to understand the cause and effect of time travel, thereby enabling them to change history. However, future Peter is killed by Claire, who claims he is a terrorist, with the Haitian's presence preventing future Peter from healing. Peter flees and tracks down Mohinder for help, telepathically extracting the information he needs when Mohinder proves unwilling.<br>  <br>  In Costa Verde, Peter finds Sylar has reassumed his former identity of Gabriel Gray, and is now raising a small child in Claire's former home. Sylar is reluctant to give Peter his ability, but in light of the fate that awaits the world, relents and teaches him how to use it, with the warning that he will also gain the hunger Sylar himself suffers from. Claire, Knox, and Daphne show up to kill Peter, and in the ensuing battle Sylar's son is killed. Enraged, Sylar loses control of his radiation ability, destroying Costa Verde

q4XUy0Duaa	Yeah, I'd have to cosign the first two comments.  You should put more emotion into it.  You came harder with your delivery on the second verse though, and you can see how much better it sounds.  Your lyrics are always dope!  I like what you did at the end of the first verse too, where you made the voice on the hook of the Rain instrumental angels.  That was a good idea.  Also the vocals aren't that crisp, but that's what happens with a shitty mic so there's not much you can do about that.  I'd love to hear this again if you ever re-record with a better mic.|`|11nqBcOcaa	i was knodding my head to the music. your lyrics a really good, i'd work on my timing and breath control though.like K.I.P said put some heart(attitude) in it. don't read lyrics feel 'em.|`|1TgIuZMqaa	listen 2 em man|`|21428fc02666515c85c83d64ffb798faaa	I see what people mean about the attitude...and breath control...but that comes with really owning the song and being used to saying it...Its almost as if you rushing through the lyrics...What you are saying is dope...now you have to find a way to let those words marinate in our heads...dont just wizz them by us...Its almost like wasting lyrics if you give to much to digest at one time... Maybe use a slower beat/delivery...that being said...the potential is there homie...keep doing your thing even if its on cheap Wal-Mart mics...|`|farhj0Kiaa	I'm feelin it...But, put some attitude in it. Like... make it you, put some inspiration behind it. I couldn't bob my head to it because It sound like you were reading. real talk...Dope tho

It talked of different types of emotions, example: love|`|elVDYy7eaa	No.

hQlp9v6Waa	It depends how good of a guitar player you are. If you suck like I do, they pretty much all sound the same. If you are a guitar god, then you can probably tell the difference. <br>  <br>  Realistically they all sound the same. I have found that the sound of a guitar is more associated with the amp that it is hooked to.<br>  <br>  I have a PRS and a Gibson SG and they almost sound the same on my Marshall amp. The only reason they sound a little bit different is because one is Strat and the other has Humbuckers.<br>  <br>  But the difference between two Epiphone Les Pauls is going to be unnoticeable.|`|L4cfoavyaa	No they don't. Most will sound similar but different models come in different configurations. Usually the most notable to the sound is the pickups. Some models just have different trim, like binding or special paint options. The things to pay attention to are A. Wood it's made from and B. Pickups it's loaded with. But tbh most of the lower priced epiphone line has pretty bad pickups to start with. No matter what every guitar will sound somewhat different from another even if its the same model. Make sure you play several of them (even the same model) before buying. Pick the one that feels and sounds best to you.|`|4jyAH75vaa	The difference in sound comes from different woods and different electronics.<br>  <br>  Higher end Les Pauls will be mahogany bodies, it's a richer tone<br>  <br>  Humbucker pickups, also on higher end instruments, tend to sound fatter.  But single coil pickups, what you'll find on entry level models, are great for clean tones.  The quality/sensitivity of a pickup of either type is reflected in cost.<br>  <br>  However much you spend, you'll sound like you.  Any guitar is capable of sounding either really great, or really crappy

(but it seemed like the american military so i think my mind just got the two countries confused. haha. dreams are weird like that)  and it was really annoying that he was too scared and was hiding. but there were these buildings like apartments except the hallways were outside and it wasnt nice. it looked like some wooden tree house or something and it looked like it was on stilts. and in every dream someone put a bomb and i woke up before the bomb went off. but in the last one i had i was talking to my friend and then i walked outside and my mother was the one with the bomb this time and she was like "i have this bomb and i guess i'm going to have to put it here" and she set it down and i was like crap now i have to go get robyn (my friend) and my brother. and everyone was running around screaming. but i woke up before it went off. <br>  <br>  i know, dreams are freakin weird. haha. but i haven't had another one of those since that one.|`|QxbErHTlaa	my best friends taylor, will, and seth died. i woke up screaming. and taylor is a guy, i think :]|`|aBALRxBUaa	It was very scary.

kkbYx7vsaa	I live in deer country so know how best to avoid such an encounter.  It's always amazed me how anyone could hit one.  They obviously are driving too fast & not paying attention to the road. I've come across the odd deer that seem rather clueless but I'm always on the look-out so have avoided a collision.  It's never a laughing matter to me.  <br>  <br>  I did hit a wolverine once & was foolish enough to have stopped out of concern.  I know I hit it.  A high mountain road.  I felt the bump against the grill of my car & the tires pass over it. I stopped to check for carnage but found nothing.  According to other experienced bush folk I've related this story to, I was lucky.  A wounded wolverine will attack to death the closest living creature no matter what injuries they themselves sustain.  The Aboriginal People refer to the Wolverine as an Evil white man liviing in the body of the Wolverine.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	i haven't, but that's crazy...the other day i did see a donkey on the side of the road and called 911 b/c if it got in traffic it could be bad...like a deer lol|`|FOeWqr0qaa	Several times but have luckily never hit one.<br>  I've hit a raccoon, rabbit, and squirrel.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	no dear in australia.|`|dVrHELZ2aa	I almost hit a moose.

uD1S5dYtaa	Those qualities are usually not part of the character of Libra.  Those with the sun in Libra can sometimes have their Mercury in Scorpio.  Scorpio can have a much sharper and more sarcastic way of communicating.  Its really difficult to tell a person's entire personality just by the Sun sign.***EDIT*** I've done some checking about this and every site I've looked at and my favorite books say nothing about behaving the way you've described.  They all say Librans are elegant, gentle, soft spoken, unable to stand any disturbances.  They will avoid conflict at any price and are very concerned with other people's feelings.  The behavior you and others describe must come from other influences in the chart.|`|aKncMsoyaa	well i wouldnt say bitchy...but im a libra and i do have a side where i will tell someone something straight out if you push me to it. i have towo sides of me...when im nice im TOO nice but if you backstab me or do anything to get on my bad side then yes i will snap at youu. but other than that i absolutley dont like to cause any trouble with anybody..|`|3MFzTysmaa	i don't know about bi+chy comments but a libra guy i just knew had a "hot and cold" personality with a smack of sarcasm|`|ba0f099392c4e5f361bd0e050604ae62aa	I have libra moon and i don't do that stuff online..because i think its rude.

However, the stuff we say is nice compared to the things we think of. I could easily be just as condescending as on Simon Cowell, we have a very witty sarcastic sense of humor and way of looking at things. We hold our tongue on a lot of issues because we want people to like us. I could easily hurt anyone's feelings with just a few words, and you will see a libra do this if they get angry or feel very upset or betrayed by someone. However we usually put peoples feelings over our desire to tell it like it is. the only reason you see Simon being so brutally honest is because he's getting filthy rich off his show, but even he bites his tongue sometimes because he sees all the animosity that comes as a result of being so outspoken.|`|T1JGLlU4aa	Im a libra, I try not be like that cuz It makes me mad when people are rude online!<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309230416AA2jDtn">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|ENOZOVgfaa	lol yea we go from good to bad real easily... my attitudes not bitchy but more in your face and telling you exactly what i think when im pissed off..  i notice we say what alot of people would probably only think pissed off or not.... i dk its probably the whole scale thingy because when im in a bad mood ive been told i get really mean but when im not pissed off they say im fun as hell to be around.. guess you gotta take the good with the bad with us<br>  <br>  but truthfully if a libras acting like that with you its either because they dont like you or youre getting on their nerves...  i wouldnt be an azz with someone i really like or im close with  .. lol unless im pmsing or something<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  oo thats weird my mercurys in scorpio also :O/|`|38cc8157846426266baa6afc6d5ab186aa	I don't know, I have a Libra 'friend' who does that sort of thing.

There's no particular rason for it, I guess, it's just that their 'scales' get kind of imbalanced.

CjPtAEzmaa	Hmmmm....got nothing better to do, I'll give it a go.<br>  <br>  Violins have the following range: Their lowest string is a G (on a piano, the G below middle C), their next string is a D, the next, an A, the last, a high E. I'm not sure at this moment what their highest note is, as I actually play viola. Think much, much higher than high E. XD<br>  <br>  So, as you would imagine, violins often carry the melody and are used to play very high. Their strings are very thin and close to the fingerboard, so a clear, bright tone is very easily produced. Vibrato (example:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbtEMKCHXT0&feature=related)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbtEMKCHX...</a> is used to enrich the tone and make it warmer. There are also many bow techniques used for expression, including spiccato (when the bow kind of 'leaps' off the string), etc. Violins can be very expressive when utilized correctly, but, as with any instrument, the expression has less to do with technique and more to do with the performer's soul.<br>  <br>  Violins are held on the shoulder, using the weight of the head to keep the violin on the shoulder. The left hand should not hold the violin at all. To make up for the lack of bulk between the violin and the shoulder, many performers use shoulder rests, the most popular/famous of which is the Kun. <a href="http://www.sharmusic.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=1313" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharmusic.com/itemdy00.asp?T1...</a> These rests are attached to the back of the violin.<br>  <br>  Cellos are much, much different. The most obvious difference is their size, of course, and the way they are held. Cellos (sometimes said 'celli') are held between the knees. <br>  <br>  Their range is also much different. Their highest string is the A below middle C, next, a D, next, a G, next a low C. Again, viola player here, not sure what the highest note you can produce on a cello is. Much higher than low A. XD<br>  <br>  The strings of a cello are thicker and farther off the fingerboard, so tone is less easily produced. But when it is, it is extremely beautiful. Cello vibrato looks like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ydi0BFszE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ydi0BFs...</a> and gives the tone a very warm, rich sound. They have all the same bow techniques as violins. They are usually used for accompaniment in an orchestra, but they occasionally enjoy a dark, satisfying melody. Cellos are much deeper, warmer, and I've heard that their range is the closest to that of human speech. Again, the amount of expression depends less on technique and more on the soul of the performer.<br>  <br>  On both violins and cellos, dynamics (loud/soft) are changed by the amount of weight put on the bow, mainly. There are many different techniques to change the volume of what you are playing. Loud sections are usually played near the frog <a href="http://www.folkofthewood.com/page369.htm)," rel="nofollow">http://www.folkofthewood.com/page369.htm...</a> and soft sections are often kept soft by tilting the stick of the bow so you're only playing on part of the hair. One nice thing about both violins and cellos is that you can change your volume in the middle of a note. A long note can start out soft and get loud by the end. :)<br>  <br>  All I can think of right now.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Here are my search results<br>  <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=instruments+of+the+orchestra+guide&ei=UTF-8&fr=moz2">http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=inst...</a>

Their leader, Braiking Boss, rules over the world with an iron fist. One day, a mysterious girl named Luna is summoned by the people for salvation of mankind.Fearing that she can be a potential threat, Braiking sends three of his most powerful cyborg warriors to dispose of Luna: Casshern, Dio and Reda. Casshern, the strongest warrior, manages to track down and kill Luna. This triggers a cataclysmic event which brings about the end of the world. Hundreds of years later, the world’s atmosphere now filled with poison, humanity is in danger of extinction, from most of the remaining population’s inability to reproduce, and the threat of the robots<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/casshern-sins/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/casshern-...</a>|`|ihtUSk4Yaa	Gundam Wing, Seed, 00 are all good, also Eureka 7, Code Geass, Blue Gender was alright, and Gurren Lagann.|`|ICEqYXy7aa	Evangelion! WATCH IT NOW!|`|0unqJPehaa	You should watch Code Geass, awesome story.|`|Z15TM1VQaa	This list should keep you going for a while but I hope it helps.<br>  <br>  Bokurano<br>  When a group of children discover a strange cave at the beach, their lives are forever changed. Inside they meet a man called Kokopelli who seems to have a lot of advanced gadgetry. He invites them to participate in a ‘game’ in which they play heroes saving Earth from fifteen giant monsters. To defeat the invaders, he will give them a powerful mecha of black armor. The children eagerly sign the contract, name their new weapon Zearth, and must now take turns to pilot it; but the ‘game’ is in fact all too real and the consequences of battle become the stuff of nightmares. With no option to cancel the contract, is there any way to stop the game before it is too late for all of them? <br>  <br>  Neon Genesis Evangelion<br>  In the future, a devastating event known as Second Impact destroyed Tokyo as we know it, giving rise to the current day Tokyo III, a city under siege by mysterious lifeforms known only as Angels. Mankind's only defense are Evangelions, man-made machines piloted by Rei, Shinji, and Asuka, all who are the tender age of fourteen. The fate of Japan and the entire world now lie with these children, though they might not have the power to save the most important thing of all: each other.<br>  <br>  Viper's Creed (has only 9 episodes so far and is still ongoing)<br>  Following a global war and climate change, 35% of Earth's land mass has sunk into the ocean. In this difficult time, countries rely not on armies but on private military corporations to provide security against constant terrorist attacks. One such company is Arqon Global Security, whose staff of mercenaries is tasked with protecting Daiva City on a pay-per-mission basis. Armed with motorcycles that transforms into weapon-wielding mecha, these "blademen" are none too popular with the people they protect - but they always get the job done!<br>  <br>  Kakurenbo: Hide & Seek (Its a movie)<br>  Near the ruins of an old and abandoned city, there is played a game simply known as "Otokoyo." It is said that when children play this game, they go missing one by one. Some say it is ghosts. Others say it is demons. But for Hikora, one thing is certain: his sister disappeared playing the game and he will do whatever it takes to find her, even if it means playing the game himself. He and seven others will do just that, all for their own reasons, and learn that rumors aren’t always fictitious. Escaping with their lives will become the main concern when this game of hide-and-seek turns deadly.<br>  <br>  Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion<br>  In 2010, the Britannian Empire enslaved Japan using powerful mecha known as Knightmares; in the aftermath Japan was renamed Area 11, and its people began a hard and terrible existence. Lelouch, a Britannian student living in Area 11, has grown up hating the Empire and everything it stands for. One day, in the middle of a terrorist attack, Lelouch meets a mysterious girl who grants him the ability to control minds. Can he use his new power to fight for freedom, or will his hatred twist his good intentions into mindless acts of vengeance? <br>  <br>  Gundam SEED<br>  The universe of the future is divided between the Earth Alliance and ZAFT. After a year of war, ZAFT attacks the neutral colony Heliopolis to steal five prototype mobile suits. The mission is a success, but a young man named Kira stumbles upon the fifth Gundam, and he may be the Alliance's only hope...<br>  <br>  Burst Angel<br>  In the future, Tokyo has fallen victim to syndicates, trigger-happy people who run rampant and other groups who don't like to follow the rules. In response, an organization called RAPT has been created, whose goal is to maintain their definition of "peace". In the underground, however, science involving humans and powerful mechanics is progressing at a steady phase, but for what purpose? Meet our four angels who know how to kick butt and raise hell whenever it's needed. Their motto? Shoot first, talk later. Their mission? To make the seemingly impossible possible, of course...<br>  <br>  G Gundam (it's hard to find but I really suggest that you watch it if you haven't seen it yet)<br>  The year is Future Century 60; much of mankind now lives in colonies surrounding the earth. After being ravaged by countless wars, every four years the dominance over the colonies is decided in a martial arts tournament called the Gundam Fight. This year marks the 13th tournament, and Gundam Fighters representing their colonies have begun to gather. Their purpose is to fight, and fight, until only one remains to claim the title "Gundam of Gundams." But Domon Kasshu, Neo Japan’s representative, has another secret mission; and should he fail, all of mankind may pay the price. Gundam Fight! Ready! Go!|`|Xv9odLdcaa	I agree, Code Geass is the best. The plot is amazing. You can check it out at wikipedia but I strongly suggest you watch it and decide for yourself. The anime has been well recognized and the main character, Lelouch, has been voted one of the best anime characters ever. If you look it uponline, some of the good mechs in the show are:<br>  <br>  Gawain, Guren-MKII, Lancelot, Shinkirou, Shen Hu, Tristan, Mordred, Akatsuki, Zangetsu, etc.

I am here to tell you to forget ALL the answers you've so far been given.  I'm going to give you the REAL DEAL on the best horror movie you can possibly see today with a psycho girl.  And it outdoes, outperforms,  out-Everything in the movies so far listed here. I am being totally serious.<br>  <br>   <br>  Rent from Netflix the french horror movie called INSIDE (à l'intérieur)' (2007), starring Beatrice Dalle.  Make sure your whole gang is with you when you see this; order pepperoni pizza with extra sauce for everyone.   I GUARANTEE that they will all look at you differently after the movie is over.<br>   <br>  AND wait - there's more!<br>   <br>  On April 28th, Dimension Extreme Video is coming out with the DVD of another french horror film called MARTYRS (2008).  This is the one that even out-does INSIDE.  I'm not kidding.  This movie was so controversial, deemed so hideously violent, that it was unreleasable in the United States.  At various film festivals, it literally sent audience members running to the bathrooms, or left them shaking & weeping in their seats.  <br>   <br>  THIS MOVIE left the director, Pascal Laugier, in the awkward position (when the movie was shown at European film festivals) of having to apologize to audience members!  And now, even the director says he hates having made the movie. This is not a joke and I'm not making this up.  <br>  <br>  MARTYRS has been called an "endurance contest" by film critics, and  that it makes HOSTEL look like BAMBI.|`|zUT4ZeM6aa	"Perfect Stranger"<br>  "American Psycho"2<br>  "Cry Wolf"<br>  "Misery"<br>  "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"<br>  "Silent Fall"<br>  "Final Analysis"<br>  "Friday the 13th" 1<br>  "Species"|`|aOFdtoR4aa	The Lodger (2009)|`|3yNvgMvLaa	the tooth fairy<br>  some of the saws<br>  the ring<br>  i like horror movies with a girl killer too.<br>  its more scary lol|`|pzdecMQyaa	The Exorcist<br>  The Ring 1 and 2<br>  The Strangers<br>  Pamela Voorhees (Friday the 13th)|`|GZnOE7oXaa	Swimfan<br>  Fatal Attraction|`|XGCHYkwFaa	have you seen hard candy or american psycho 2 w/ mila kunis
WdhAEQZwaa	Oh My God...... that is sooo mean... cuz Tyson is the most awesome guy ever!!!!!!!! i love him so much and wanna know something? I've loved tyson for heaps long.... bout 7 years now. So thats nearly as long as you've liked Kim.<br>  And i think your wrong about him. He's probably been turned down by plenty of girls when he was younger. For one thing he used to be fat. For another... have you ever listened to any of the songs from their first album... cuz basically its all about him getting heartbroken when his exes have dumped him or whatever.<br>  Sure you have every right to be jealous or watever ( i know exactly how you feel cuz i really don't like kim for one reason.... the fact that she's dating the man of my dreams) but don't be mean bout him. He's awesome!!!!<br>  <br>  But one thing i think you're right about is that they should definitely break up. I wish they'd have moved on too. But they haven't so that sucks heaps.<br>  <br>  Anyways good luck on the whole kim thing. Maybe you might meet her someday.... and she'll fall madly in love with you... then leave Tyson for you... and then he's free to fall in love with me... and then we'll all get our happily ever afters!!!! Hey you never know.... it could happen...<br>  <br>  Misson Break-up Kim && Tyson is sooooooo on!!!!!<br>  =D|`|dbf8cd4de5eb3051693b6ace6a00274caa	no, they are still together
9W3nLL6iaa	The hour-long series followed the life of a young Italian-American woman, loosely based on Ms. Ruggiero's life, (Lydia DeLucca, played by Heather Paige Kent) and her family in a suburban New Jersey. The show was set in fictional Bellefield, ostensibly a play on the combination of Belleville and Bloomfield, two adjacent older working class suburbs on the north side of Newark, New Jersey. The show premièred a year after The Sopranos, also about an Italian-American family set in the New Jersey suburbs. Whereas The Sopranos depicted an organized crime family, however, That's Life was a light-hearted depiction of a law-abiding family (headed by veteran motion picture actors Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino).<br>  <br>  In the first season, Frank DeLucca worked as a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike, while Dolly was a housewife. In the second season, Frank retired (after suffering a heart attack on the job, and he and Dolly opened a restaurant. Kevin Dillon played Paulie, Lydia's younger brother who was a young officer on the Bellefield Police Department who still lived at home. Debi Mazar played Jackie, Lydia's wise-cracking friend who owned a hair salon. The show mixed family situations with situations focusing on Lydia's life as a young single woman looking for both love and stable career, and for more out of life than simply raising children.<br>  <br>  The first season revolved around the fallout of Lydia from breaking off her engagement with her fiance and moving away from home for the first time. Most of the situations were light-hearted, but plots occasionally delved into a darker subjects, including Paulie's struggle to resist the temptation to fall into corruption as a police officer. In the second season, Lydia enrolled at a local university somewhat resembling nearby Montclair State University to pursue a career in sports medicine. Her mother Dolly successfully ran for city council of Bellefield. The show developed a small fan base and received generally positive critical response, but languished in the ratings, despite the presence of well-known names in its cast. It was cancelled at the end of the second season with numerous unresolved plot lines, including the budding romance between Lydia and one of her doctor-professors.<br>  <br>  [edit] Cast<br>  <br>      * Heather Paige Kent - Lydia DeLucca<br>      * Debi Mazar - Jackie O'Grady<br>      * Ellen Burstyn - Dolly DeLucca<br>      * Paul Sorvino - Frank DeLucca<br>      * Kevin Dillon - Paulie DeLucca<br>      * Danielle Harris - Plum Wilkinson DeLucca<br>      * Gregory Jbara - Jo Jo Regosi
