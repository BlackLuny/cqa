OU9xnW86aa	Is your degree in paralegal studies?  If not, you will not be qualified to work as a paralegal.  If so, congrats!  You need to realistic and understand that fresh paralegals do not make big bucks.  Your salary will depend on a few things (i.e. size of the law firm, government v. private sector, big v. small city).<br>  <br>  Your starting yearly income could be anywhere from $25,000/year ($12.00/hour) to $40,000/year ($19.25/hour).  $25k being a small private practice and $40k being a large law firm in a large city.<br>  <br>  You can calculate salary based on location and years of experience on one of the many salary websites.  Try that to get a more accurate idea.|`|853oJWuPaa	It really depends in which city you'll work.  In DC your starting salary (in BigLaw) will be approximately $30k-$35k, in NY $35k-$40k, not including overtime.  Some of our legal assistants took up to $60k home per month, but in those months they were working REALLY hard (i.e. several all-nighters, weekends, etc).  <br>  <br>  Don't fall for the loan consolidation crap in some of the answers.  Work hard, pay back your loans.  You're on track, dude!|`|1aRXbEY2aa	My best suggestion to you is to live below your means when you get a job, pay off the debt and then get the new vehicle and the appartment.  I suggest you to live like a student, the first year you may make 30K-45K but then after you will make more money depending on what city you live in.|`|AA10283296	A lot less than you think, and your advisers told you.<br>  <br>  I have seen paralegals make anywhere from $22,000 and up.<br>  <br>  At this point in your career, the experience is worth more than anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your search.|`|3mAgM405aa	The opportunities for a paralegal really depends on the specialty. The most in demand paralegals are those in the litigation field; followed by corporate paralegals who are responsible for maintaining corporate records, articles of incorporation, etc. While the "least" marketable [but the "highest" paid] paralegals are in the field of intellectual property [i.e., patents, trademarks] and immigration law. In conclusion, choose your paralegal courses accordingly, with emphasis on litigation preparation [discovery], docketing/calendaring of incoming pleadings [calendaring] and trial preparation [creating Exhibit tabs, Bajii jury instructions, etc.]. The "pro" side of a litigation paralegal is often "unlimited" overtime which can amount to a high salary range of $65,000 to $75,000 per year, while the "downside," being constantly pressured to meet a monthly client billable quota. And failing to meet that quota, often results in the paralegal's overnight dismissal. It's not a pretty picture. I just want to lay out what really happens in the real world of litigators and their relationship with subordinate paralegals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|6rXyaUAoaa	I don't understand why you and other people don't clarify your question with info like what state??? or city, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, calling local employment agencies in the city where you want to work, and explaining what your needs are will be your best information.<br>  <br>  Also, you might call the legal training centers and ask them what the going rate is.<br>  <br>  there are so many variables...
N1SPyFSDaa	I'm a landlord, and I've rented to non-family groups before where the same issue came up.  One of the roommates is no good for the rent and makes the other roommates look bad.  It's a serious issue, especially if you are all on the same lease (which I assume you are).<br>  Here is what happened in my specific circumstance:<br>  One roommate out of four was not good on the rent more than once.  The other roommates complained to me, saying that they can't get the one to cooperate.  I told them that even though I'm sympathetic to their situation, there really is nothing I can do to change it without punishing all of them, as they are all considered one party under the lease.  I told them they would have to solve it in-house.  Anyway, it never got solved, and so I decided (for fairness' sake, since I try not to be an evil landlord) to terminate the lease instead of evict.  This way there is no court or whatever, they have 60 days notice to get out.<br>  <br>  A few recommendations that would work with me:<br>  - insist that they pay by money order, no check or cash.<br>  - if they still don't pay, you might want to sue them.  You will have a case.<br>  - you and your boyfriend go to the landlord and request that they terminate your lease.  Normally, a landlord won't do this because that is a vacancy issue, but assure the landlord that you and your boyfriend wish to immediately sign a new lease upon the termination of the old one.  This way, you can stay there, and the crappy roommate will be ousted.  Look for a new roommate or sublease if possible.  Request that each roommate have a separate lease, this way if one person messes up, it doesn't punish the whole group.  This may take some diplomatic persuasion, but if your landlord is reasonable, this might work.<br>  <br>  From any landlord's perspective, they don't care how much you like your roommates as long as they get their rent check every month and you don't destroy the place.  If you can guarantee that, they'll usually bend.|`|vDafDiOraa	I rented with 3 friends once and we requested four separate leases stating the responsibility of each of us.  One of them didn't pay, she got the bad credit and got evicted- not us.<br>  <br>  I don't like when they group everyone onto one lease, especially when you find out you have a bum for a friend.|`|IE76J3TAaa	Give the "friend" the boot! i was in a very similar position some years back when my roommate bounced checks with no shame. The messed up part was i depended on his check to pay for other bills so when his didn't clear all of my checks bounced which equaled a $20 charge for each bounced check! |`|hvqKa9cbaa	kick her out|`|K0MeNwMzaa	i was in a situation similar years ago. we talked to our landlord first. he was very nice and agreed to let the other move out and sign a new lease with us as long as the roommate went willingly. But i would defiantly talk to the roommate. and if you move out and your name is still on the lease and any damage is done the landlord can come back and sue you too, even though your not living there, b/c your name is on the lease. and if the roommate moves out the landlord may want to sign a new lease. not sure of all the rules and laws now. but it sounds like a change needs to be made. a friend of mine just got stuck with 1200.00$  of rent and bills b/c her roommate was doing the same thing and now the roommate doesn't feel she should have to pay her back.  |`|bZfd5Uf7aa	Give him two options.<br>  1. Pay what is owed, plus an extra month to be deposited with you and your boyfriend just in case this happens agin. That deposit will not be given back until June. Also tell him that if it happens again, he has to leave and that you will use that deposit to pay his share of the rent while you look for another roommate.<br>  2. Move out! <br>  <br>  Legally, you just cant kick him out. If he knows this and tries to use that against you, email me and I will let you know about some loopholes to the law that will ensure his swift exit.<br>  <br>  If he chooses to move out, you and your boyfriend have to decide if:<br>  1. Can you afford it without a roommate?<br>  2. Are you willing to look for another roommate?<br>  <br>  If staying is not an option, discuss with your landlord ways you can work out breaking the lease. Unfortunately, the landlord has all the power. See if he will start looking for another tenant and let you out as long a replacement can be found. If he does not want to work with you, read your lease very carefully and see if there are any areas that might allow you to break it due to the landlord's fault. If nothing is there, then go through that place with a microscope and try to find anything and everything that could possibly be wrong and require the landlord to fix it. Especially anything that could be viewed and a hazard like mold that would cost him $$$$$$, flickering lights that could be from arching which is a fire hazard that will cost him $$$$$. I know this is a dirty tactic, but you want to send a signal that "hey, if you are not going to work with us, its going to cost you!". |`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Passing a bad check is a criminal offense.<br>  <br>  Tell him if he does not make good on his rent, you will file a police report.  Don't be a push over...he's taking advantage of you and your BF because you let him get away with it once already.|`|3EyK4x2Naa	It is messing up your rental credibility. I suggest you take matters into your own hands by asking the other roommate to pay you cash, and write the total check out of your account. That's what I do. I love my roommate to death, I've known her since I was 8, but she's ditzy. So she gives me her part of rent and bills in cash, and I take care of making sure it gets to the right places.<br>  <br>  Good luck. |`|A1ftqRH4aa	Perhaps you should require her to pay by cash or money order instead of a check.|`|UQRpNiyCaa	INFORM YOUR LANDLORD first and foremost and explain the sticky details!! The sooner then better. <br>  <br>  I would find another roommate you and your boyfriend could both agree on before presenting any situations, and let the potential roommate know the situation.<br>  Explain to your landlord how you and your boyfriend cannot afford to take hits from your roommates irresponsibility and his financial crisis should not be yours. Let him know you found another roommate to fill the lease and ask how he would feel about that. <br>  Make him aware that if your roommate doesn't pay it hurts both of you including the landlord!<br>  <br>  Otherwise if he doesn't agree with that I would ask how much it would be to sublease your apartment and I'd get a two bedroom for just the two of you.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|s76aC4G8aa	Tell your roommate that he now has to pay you by certified check or money order, that he is responsible for any bounced check fees.  You have to put your foot down, write up a list of rules and have him sign it.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is if he isn't pulling his weight then don't break the lease (you're right it's a nightmare to break a lease and it'll haunt you) tell him that you are going to ask him to leave.  When is your lease up?  At the end of the lease term tell him that he's out and move at that time if he won't leave on his own.<br>  <br>  This is your problem not the landlords, their problem is the rent issue, if he's pulling these stunts then it's your fault for renting to him.  Tell him if he doesn't straighten up then he has to move out.  All three of you need to sit down and discuss this.  This shouldn't ruin your credit if it's his check that's bouncing.<br>  <br>  |`|uweLaHQraa	you need to get on a separate lease from this guy see if your landlord will separate you guys b/c this roommate can ruin a lot more than you think, you can come right out and let him know how you are feeling and let him know that this issue is ruining your lease, you could torture him, have sex on his stuff make a mess and eat all of his food then tell him it would be fine for him to leave, thats what my roommate did when she wanted to move me out and move her man in and it sure worked

IE76J3TAaa	I'm in the same situation. Sit tight and wait to see what comes of the bailout. From what i hear there will be programs for RESPONSIBLE homeowners who are upside down on their mortgages.  If nothing should come of the bailout i'll be more than happy to give my house back to the bank.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Real estate does not have an upside down system as cars do.  Cars shouldn't either, but that is a topic for another day.<br>  <br>  What you are going to need is a short sale, but your lender will have to approve this, which is unlikely in your scenario.  Also, a short sale will have negative ramifications to your credit, which will effect any possibility of getting another mortgage. <br>  <br>  Another avenue you could explore is renting your condo.<br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you decide to do.|`|4500fcb8dac835d076f6df6cc541a486aa	No........ sell your condo, then buy a house, that is the way it works.|`|m8RZcY44aa	Nope, sorry you have to play by the rules.|`|38c303a5bdc786d68c71014c678b49faaa	There is not a system like that for houses.  Too many people are just walking away from their home.  Think of it this way...you didnt take on a house payment you borrowed money to buy a house.  You may not have seen the cash, but you did borrow the money.  You signed a paper agreeing to pay the money back and at those terms.  You could walk away from the home and destroy your credit.  But if you do you had better plan on being in the new loan the rest of your life as no lender would give you a loan after that.  Not to mention plan on buying a car in cash from that point forward, and pay for everything in cash, as your credit cards will most likely be shut off, and your interest rates will go sky high on them.  So make sure they are paid off before you do as credit card companies use a method called universal default.  SO if you default on one loan you are in default on all loans.

5ap9dppMaa	I'm in HR Management and I have heavy interaction with people all day. If you are very shy, it may be a little uncomfortable for you (unless you warm up after a few weeks). I was a little shy when I started my career, and being in HR actually helped me open up a lot more.<br>  <br>  HR positions can vary. Recruiting may not be your cup of tea since it's basically people interaction constantly, but payroll/benefits management may be a better option. Even then though, depending on how big of a company you work for, people will be coming to you for advice and questions. HR on all levels is based on communication. So if you're just shy "at first" and ease yourself into a job and gain confidence, then HR could be good. If you prefer less interaction with people on a daily basis, I would suggest looking at other options. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|VZrCZABDaa	Well when you work in an area such as human resources, a desirable candidate should have excellent people skills. It includes communicating, recruiting, hiring all of which require a individual to be talkative, agreeable, and somewhat outgoing so that you can relate to the variety of different personalities that you will come in contact with. It is a promising career choice and I don't think that you should limit yourself because you feel that you are shy. What is keeping you in your shell? Perhaps you should become more involved with those around you. Join a club or activity that interests you. That way you will be surrounded by people that share your ideas and passions and thus will allow you to open up more! Instead of searching for a job that will hide you, look for something that will open you up more! |`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	Any new job is hard when you're shy.

ZaFreVDhaa	I don’t understand. Paypal doesn’t sell stuff. They are an online service, (Like a bank) that takes care of money for business instead of those businesses needing to set up their own merchant account. (That’s what lets a business take credit cards.) <br>  <br>  They have accounts and also issue disposable one time use credit cards for shopping on line, as well as paypal MasterCard. They also convert money for international transactions. (Like Euros into dollars and so on.)<br>  <br>  If you paid with something through paypal, you have something called buyer’s protection. You have fill out the online dispute form. In a case like this, you would click the ‘item not received button’ under reason. Then they open an investigation and see if the seller shipped it. If the seller didn’t, then you can get a chargeback, just like a regular credit card.<br>  <br>  I love paypal because they don’t allow companies to set up automatic charges on your credit card, and their fraud protection is the best I’ve seen. <br>  <br>  Contact them. They have a phone # on their website. <br>  |`|XqfH76PMaa	Paypal doesn't have anything to do with the actual shipping of a product.  They only handle the money.

Paypal moves money, not items.  If you have ordered an item from ebay, the bottom of the ad should have specified what shipper would be used.  Also, the seller should have sent you an email stating the status, ship date, ship method, etc of you item.

AA10305589	Let's see what the FBI has to say: <br>  <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/fraudschemes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/frauds...</a><br>  <br>  Nigerian Letter or "419" Fraud<br>  <br>  Nigerian letter frauds combine the threat of impersonation fraud with a variation of an advance fee scheme in which a letter, mailed from Nigeria, offers the recipient the "opportunity" to share in a percentage of millions of dollars that the author, a self-proclaimed government official, is trying to transfer illegally out of Nigeria. The recipient is encouraged to send information to the author, such as blank letterhead stationery, bank name and account numbers and other identifying information using a facsimile number provided in the letter. Some of these letters have also been received via E-mail through the Internet. The scheme relies on convincing a willing victim, who has demonstrated a "propensity for larceny" by responding to the invitation, to send money to the author of the letter in Nigeria in several installments of increasing amounts for a variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  Payment of taxes, bribes to government officials, and legal fees are often described in great detail with the promise that all expenses will be reimbursed as soon as the funds are spirited out of Nigeria. In actuality, the millions of dollars do not exist and the victim eventually ends up with nothing but loss. Once the victim stops sending money, the perpetrators have been known to use the personal information and checks that they received to impersonate the victim, draining bank accounts and credit card balances until the victim's assets are taken in their entirety. While such an invitation impresses most law-abiding citizens as a laughable hoax, millions of dollars in losses are caused by these schemes annually. Some victims have been lured to Nigeria, where they have been imprisoned against their will, in addition to losing large sums of money. The Nigerian government is not sympathetic to victims of these schemes, since the victim actually conspires to remove funds from Nigeria in a manner that is contrary to Nigerian law. The schemes themselves violate section 419 of the Nigerian criminal code, hence the label "419 fraud."<br>  <br>  Some Tips to Avoid Nigerian Letter or "419" Fraud:<br>  <br>  If you receive a letter from Nigeria asking you to send personal or banking information, do not reply in any manner. Send the letter to the U.S. Secret Service, your local FBI office, or the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. You can also register a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Sentinel. <br>  <br>  If you know someone who is corresponding in one of these schemes, encourage that person to contact the FBI or the U.S. Secret Service as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Be skeptical of individuals representing themselves as Nigerian or foreign government officials asking for your help in placing large sums of money in overseas bank accounts.<br>  <br>  Do not believe the promise of large sums of money for your cooperation.<br>  <br>  Guard your account information carefully.

lObEjUh1aa	unless you are applying for a management job, it's unskilled labor (but there are still qualifications).  they won't be interested in your education or your experience, but they will be interested in all of the following:<br>  <br>  1.  how you present yourself.  their customers are going to see you.  do you dress nicely?  are you friendly and personable?<br>  <br>  2.  punctuality.  if they are counting on you to perform a function, they need to know you will be consistently on time.  maybe present some examples of activities you've participated in that you were consistently on time for.<br>  <br>  3.  your stress management skills.  fast food is called "fast" for a reason.  there will be times when customers will be riding your *** to get it done quickly.  will you have an emotional breakdown, get in the customer's face, or do you have a healthy release for this sort of stress?  (hint: exercise is a very healthy release for this)<br>  <br>  4.  your availability.  jobs like this have a really high turnover, so they are going to want to know how long you plan to stay in the job.  be honest; if you are only looking for short term employment, that won't necessarily prevent you from getting the job.  it's just important that they know how long that term is.  it's also important for them to know your schedule.  if you have school, athletics, or other activities, it's important for them to know when you can be available.  set a realistic goal here or other aspects of your life (including but not limited to your health) will suffer.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps; good luck!|`|E59mK1FUaa	A trained monkey could get a job at McDonalds.

NYUgWQNAaa	There are a number of criteria that must be met before a qualified loan remodification or workout plan is implemented.  You will have to qualify for the loan and the lender will have to requalify you as though you are getting a new loan.  In other words, if you can't make your payments based on your current income, your loan will not be modified.<br>  <br>  Some lenders are using caution because the money they are supposed to get from the government for loan remodification purposes may not have become available to them, yet, and some lenders are still trying to understand the program.<br>  <br>  Based on what you are saying, your lender may not be in a position to underwrite your loan as it is now.  Did you get your initial loan through Aurora or did they buy your loan from another company?  Is your loan an FHA loan?  If it is an FHA loan,  Aurora may not be set up to do FHA loans and it may have to be rewritten by an FHA approved lender.<br>  <br>  At this point, you may have to do what Aurora is telling you to do, but they should give you more specifics.  Call Aurora and  ask to speak to a manager who works in the loan remodification department.  The person who answers the phone at Aurora may not be up to speed on answering your concerns, so ask for a manager.  Ask the manager to be specific on what you need to do because appraisals and other expenses will be out of your pocket expenses.     <br>  <br>      * The Loan Modification Act prohibits the causing of a negative amortization of the loan.<br>      * It prohibits the requiring of the borrower to pay additional points or fees.<br>      * It must improve the ability of the borrower to avoid foreclosure.<br>      * The agreement must also provide a regular scheduled payment that is reasonable for that borrower.<br>  <br>  If you are under the threat of foreclosure or bankruptcy, it is a very serious matter and your lender should treat it as such.  There are companies that specialize in loan remodifications, but they charge a fee and you should make sure that they are legitimate because there is a lot of fraud being perpetuated on people who are under pressure with their home loans.  |`|AA11173563	you do need a lender as Aurora is not one they are a serving company. Get wit Countrywide or Citi bank or a local bank as they suggested since it may not get approved and they may be able to refi for you|`|Lph5nVslaa	you need to find your borrowers set of loan documents or call your local title company and find who was the lender before being sold aurora.or call them back(aurora) and ask , by calling you does this start the modifying process or do i need to contact the Original lender,since aurora does nothing but handle the servicing of this loan meaning collecting and processing payments .however aurora also shouled be the one to give all the necessary info on whats you need to do or contact to gets this going.as far as time frame. the question to you is how many month have you missed if any on the mortgage.must lenders to date wants three month down before starting the modifying process.however some lenders are or will be trying to reach out to you before this time and get things going but unfortunately their are few and far between. countrywide/indymac/fannie mae.also is the loan you did that aurora is servicing an fha loan if so .<br>  they are correct.ask if you can streamline a modification if this is the case hope so their really good about it also you need to start rounding up all the financial paperwork again just like you did for the loan.or stupid me sorry .you need w2's is employed recent month payslip full month is getting twice a month full time period.your monthly statements consumer and bank statements also 401 k monies .welcome to full documentation if not already aware. don't worry about if the income is light that's the point.but as long as it makes sense to the lender.good luck

xoqQbHi1aa	  Please do not do "debt consolidation". It is not free and it will take you longer to become debt free. You can do it faster and cheaper on your own. Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you.  <br>    Do not borrow from your 401(k), you will lose too much in interest.  You may consider stopping your contributions to your 401(k) until you get your debt paid off but just remember that your take home pay may not go up if it the extra money puts you in a higher withholding bracket.  You can check with you Human Resources Department and they can run the numbers for you.<br>  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell whatever you don't use or need and use that money to pay down your debt.<br>  <br>  B. Consider getting a temporary part time job and use all of that salary to pay off your debt quicker. It is better to have a no fun year<br>  than a no fun decade.<br>  <br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts, if you are not already, and make no more late payments, if you have had any. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.|`|XqfH76PMaa	When you borrow from your 401K, they will give you a print out of what you will be paying out (each week or every two weeks, depending on how you are paid).  That amount is in addition to what you are paying in now.  We borrowed from ours and we pay about $50 a month plus what we normally put in.  Once they give you the print out, you can look it over and decide if you want to accept it or not and take it from there.  I hope that I have helped you!

Si ella te eligió a tí fue porque confiaba en que harías las cosas tal como a ella le hubiera gustado. Además sabía de tu honestidad y buen juicio, si no no te hubiera dejado esa responsabilidad.

No demerites el concepto que ella tenía de ti. Date la oportunidad de sentir la satisfacción de haber cumplido.

Basically as long as the place is clean and does everything all other McDonalds do, you are set and almost completely unlikely to lose money after the first year (almost everyone loses money the first year, but after that you should be set).  The biggest problem is that you can't always have the last decision in any decision making process, though of course it means you probably have to do less work as well.|`|0316fc9ef3fd70ccd3b97e3f86639fa6aa	well .. like 65% of America is FAT , so hey at lest you will make Money off the people , an even when they pass away from Clogged artier's (sp?)  , you'll have there FAT kids who are gonna repeat the same pattern as there parents.|`|9d5612ccab709c04158dae2851de6d4daa	You really need to read Fast Food Nation.<br>  <br>  Then tell me you want to franchise McD<br>  <br>  Did you know the organic market is growing 300% per year?<br>  Just a thought...

AA11931048	First, you must be certified as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) -- not a college degree. After that, I recommend that you find a job with an ambulance company to gain experience. After about 6 months of working for a ambulance company, then go to Paramedic school and work as a medic for a while. Then apply for Fire. Each area is different, but you may want to check out this -- <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos158.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos158.htm</a>|`|uKMX0xU7aa	Just like the last answerer said, you will need an EMT and go to paramedic school first.

I'll break it down with the basics - <br>  <br>  To learn more about the consulting industry, research other consultants in your area and online from all over. You will get a better understanding of how you need to structure your business. We can help you with that as my company does offer small business consulting and I would love to help you out. I mentor new business owners all the time. <br>  <br>  To learn more about starting a business, check with the federal or state (provincial) government in your area for the legal requirements to start a business. Search - "business registration (your state or province)". That's your best resource.<br>  <br>  As for getting started you need to write a business plan. Research your operating costs etc. Understand how to market your services by looking at how other successful business-to-business companies market in your area. You need professional looking business cards / marketing materials and a website. Maybe join your local chamber of commerce and other networking organizations in your area. That will help you get started with a few clients.<br>  <br>  The list goes on and on..... contact me is you want some help. I work with new business owners like you every day handling all of these issues. Check out our website at <a href="http://www.dubois-sbms.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dubois-sbms.com/</a> for information and you can email us through that site also.

h7ygMBP8aa	Do you mean fee?<br>  Well pay, in the UK for a trainee lawyer contracts start at about 25-35.000 pounds per year and the average for a lawyer who has about 10 years in the profession is at around 70-80.000.<br>  Of course the annual pay does vary from city to city and from  firm to firm.|`|CLN30Zewaa	A Lawyer has an ethical duty, imposed by law, to assess reasonable fees for services. Failure to observe the duty can subject the lawyer to suspension or disbarment. <br>  <br>  What fee is reasonable, is generally determined by what other lawyers who practice in the same community charge for similar services. <br>  <br>  However, an attorney with considerable experience in criminal law and especially DUI defense can "reasonably" charge more for his/her services. <br>  <br>  Most people are unaware that they have considerable control over the cost of legal representation. Lawyers all deliver itemized statements for services rendered, and if you as a client, believe that a particular service is unreasonable, then by your writing a letter to the lawyer and stating that you wish to place the particular billing charge in dispute, the lawyer is legally obligated to leave the amount in dispute in the client's trust account until such time as the dispute is resolved. <br>  <br>  This means that neither you nor the lawyer can touch the money until you either come to a negotiated settlement of the matter, or a judge or arbitrator makes a determination of what amount of fee is reasonable under the circumstances. <br>  <a href="http://www.san-francisco-oakland-bay-area-lawyers-attorneys-directory.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.san-francisco-oakland-bay-are...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sacramento-ca-lawyers-attorneys-directory.com/sacramento-legal-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacramento-ca-lawyers-attorne...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.la-orange-county-lawyers-attorney-directory.com/los_angeles_orange-county-legal-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.la-orange-county-lawyers-atto...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.las-vegas-nevada-lawyer-attorney-legal-injury-defense-directory.com/las-vegas-lawyers-attorneys-legal-defense-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.las-vegas-nevada-lawyer-attor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.san-jose-ca-lawyers-attorneys-directory.com/san_jose-legal-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.san-jose-ca-lawyers-attorneys...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sacramento-ca-lawyers-attorneys-directory.com/sacramento-legal-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacramento-ca-lawyers-attorne...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dallas-fort-worth-texas-lawyers-attorneys-directory.com/dallas-legal-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dallas-fort-worth-texas-lawye...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.new-jersey-lawyers-directory.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.new-jersey-lawyers-directory....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.legal-advice-library.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.legal-advice-library.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.san-antonio-texas-lawyers-attorneys-directory.com/san_antonio-legal-services.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.san-antonio-texas-lawyers-att...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.brokerforyou.com/san-diego-real-estate-sales.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brokerforyou.com/san-diego-re...</a><br>  <a href="http://sandiegolawyerforyou.com/san-diego-criminal-law.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sandiegolawyerforyou.com/san-dieg...</a><br>  <a href="http://sandiegolawyerforyou.com/san-diego-immigration-law.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sandiegolawyerforyou.com/san-dieg...</a>

AAlB49iraa	you can call the irs at 800-829-1954 and put in the head of household's social security number (tax id) and it will track your rebate. It will even tell you the date it is scheduled for direct deposit, if it is still being reviewed, etc. oh and btw, yes it comes thru much faster direct deposit.
oU9rI4woaa	If you have an itemized list, police report and some photos you won't have any trouble.  If you have replacement cost coverage, you'll get the $6,000 minus your deductible.  <br>  <br>  Adjusters can tell when someone is trying to lie, so don't do that, it won't help.  I don't know why you assume the carrier will shortchange you.  We normally see adjusters doing a fine job.<br>  <br>  The property in the shed will be covered the same as property in the house.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FA1l64EOaa	Generally, adjusters try to avoid paying as much as possible.  However, the bottom line is that they have to abide by what is outlined in your policy and on your Dec page.  If your homeowners policy covers theft (or mysterious disappearance), then it depends on what your coinsurance amount is.  For example, if your coinsurance is 80%, you would probably get about $4,500 back.  Keep in mind, that policies are underwritten to protect the company before the claimant.  To answer your question, the adjuster will not try to screw you.  My advice is to simply work with your adjuster, be cordial and pleasant, and there will not be any kind of adversarial relationship.|`|dcf22abaabe712c7c6abd9464ff58ab2aa	It will depend on your policy.  Check the fine print to see if you had to itemize each item that you wanted to be insured, if you have to have your original sales receipts with serial numbers (on applicable items), and if they will deduct money for depreciation (a tv bought yesterday is worth more than a tv that has had some wear and tear on it due to being bought a few years ago), and if insurance reimburses you for the cost you paid for the item or if they only pay replacement value.|`|XxQVSzGiaa	I would expect $2,500-$4,00.<br>  if you have some receipts from things that would help a lot as well.|`|ePFrVDOGaa	1. Was your coverage in-force at the time of the loss?<br>  <br>  2. Did you file a police report.<br>  <br>  3. Do you have an itemzed list of the stolen/damaged items?<br>  <br>  4. Do you have anything to back up actually having the items? (pictures, receipts, etc)<br>  <br>  If you have an Actual Cash Value policy, then you will get the depreciated value of the items.<br>  <br>  If you have Replacement Cost coverage, you will get the cost to replace the items with like items at current (new) value.<br>  <br>  Also, your deductible applies.<br>  <br>  These answers are based on Texas Insurance coverage. Not sure what state you are in.|`|bc9d29eac31274204bc1cee7e044010eaa	Claims adjusting on homeowners claims is not as contentious as with auto, I think you should be fine.  Keep in mind there are several standard (low) limits on many specific items:<br>  <br>  standard $250 deductible<br>  <br>  special limits:<br>  $200 on cash/gold<br>  $1,500 Jewelry (unless specifically added to policy)<br>  $2,500 for items used for business purposes<br>  $2,500 silverware<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|VpR6qvb5aa	Here's what you need to do:<br>  - Prove the loss (photos, receipts, police reports)<br>  - Accurately price it out without exaggerating (which will destroy your credibility) Provide the current replacement costs, and the ages of the items (include brand names and models), and let your adjuster calculate depreciation. You will probably come out better.<br>  <br>  I was an adjuster for 20 years, and the people that could prove their loss, and put the effort into documenting the amount claimed, came out MUCH better than people that couldn't prove their loss, or exaggerated, or guessed at values.|`|M3pjhIecaa	They invariably pitch low and you can refuse and ask for more and negotiate the settlement, obviously you would estimate over the top until its at the required level. They work on you screwing them and you work on them screwing you till you get to a level both are comfortable with, they will obviously come up with have you got receipts and how many of us keep them for years, just find the value of a replacement either the same or close to and that should be what you get. Otherwise once you have the police file number they're obligated to pay out on the claims unless they can prove insurance fraud, the flip side of that is you making insurance payments that they refuse to honour.
oU9rI4woaa	A renter's policy will give you liability and property coverage.  The landlord wants the liability, but the property coverage is what comes in handy most often.  $15,000 of property coverage will run you $10-15 per month depending on where you are and what type of building.|`|hSOYndoxaa	I have my renters insurance through State Farm I also have my car insurance through them and I pay about $10 per month.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	ive got the same problem . it can depend on a few things . first i would recommend you check with your car insurance company . you can get discounts by haveing both with them . ive got mine throug met life. every company rates differently though so dont worry about getting rates from several . mine cost around 200 a year but they are usually around the 100 dollar level. your apartment will probably provide some too. make sure it covers the contents of your apt if your robbed|`|3UdYDxE4aa	Loni L, Home insurance is actually very flexible.

To come up with a logo takes time, a knowledge about the business, where the logo will be seen and much more. Do you even know what kind of format you want it in? Do you want it in a bitmap or a vector? That is a trick question. If you are starting a business and you are serious about it then be serious about your logo. It is the first think people see and the last thing they will remember. Starting a business requires an investment and that is what buying a logo is.

A new roof isn't an expense even if this was a rental - it's depreciated over years and you end up with a few dollars a year.  In your case, the cost of your roof is added to the basis (your investment cost) of the house to help offset capital gains when you sell.|`|AAlB49iraa	absolutely not. you would be red flagged by the irs for five years. then you have to file every year on the same things and count a loss or gain. not to mention the depreciation table, trust me it is not worth it.

dRezbY31aa	It is a legitimate insurance company. However, if you do an internet search you'll find a lot of negativity about the company. I won't say anything negative about the company but I do have a comparison of their policies with other company's policies.<br>  <br>  Their policies are not major medical policies; they are hospital certificates.<br>  <br>  Mega deductible is per confinement, which means if you go into the hospital 3 times in one year you have 3 deductibles to meet. Most plans’ deductible is per year.<br>  <br>  Lifetime maximum for Mega is $1 Million. Major medical plans are $2 to $8 Million.<br>  <br>  Mega has an annual maximum per illness of $500,000. Most Major medical have NO annual maximums.<br>  <br>  Depending upon the policy, Mega will only pay UP to $600 per day if you are admitted to the hospital. Average daily hospital cost - $3300, Average stay – Three days. For the average hospital stay MEGA will pay up to $1800, you will pay $8100.<br>  <br>  Depending upon the policy, Mega will only pay UP to $1500 per day if you are in ICU. Average cost - $8500, Average stay – Two days. For the average ICU stay MEGA will pay up to $3000, you will pay $14,000. Since most people (unless they’re dead) have a hospital stay after the ICU stay you can add in the figures from the previous paragraph.<br>  <br>  Doctor visits while you are in the hospital is limited to $50 per visit and limited to ONE visit per day. Average cost - $120, Average number of daily visits – TWO. For the average 3 day hospital stay MEGA will pay $150, you will pay $570.<br>  <br>  Ambulance transport is limited to $250 per trip and payable only if you are admitted to the hospital for over 24 hours. If you are transported to the ER and not admitted - no benefits. The average cost for ambulance - $1000. For the ambulance (if you are admitted to the hospital) MEGA will pay $250, you will pay $750. For the ambulance (if you are NOT admitted to the hospital) MEGA will pay $0, you will pay $1000. <br>  <br>  <br>  Air ambulance is not covered unless additional rider purchased. Maximum benefits with Mega are $3500. Average cost in my area - $15,000 - $22,000. Your bill - $11,500+.<br>  <br>  Many other limitations for: miscellaneous hospital inpatient charges, inpatient and outpatient surgery, routine physicals, anesthesiologist and more. Plus you have to pay the expensive yearly dues.<br>  <br>  If you get a comprehensive major medical plan, even if it has a $5000 deductible and $2500 co-insurance, the most you'll pay is $7500 per year plus misc. Dr. co-pays. Still a lot of money but much less than MEGA.|`|bc9d29eac31274204bc1cee7e044010eaa	Actually I might have interned at that company.  It was called MEGA life and health insurance company out of Dallas (Grapevine was the suburb) but the name has changed a lot.  When I worked there it seemed like a typical C- kind of 'office' company to work for.<br>    Later I read an article in the Wall Street Journal about the company and how they would get people to buy insurance from them by kindof tricking members of an organization or union into thinking it was non-profit insurance offered by their organization.  Anyway I think they are a legit but sub-par company.

vc4cuDQjaa	Here are some tips to always have great credit.  These come right from the credit agencies as I deal with them on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  1. Don't just pay on time - make your payments at least 5 business days before your due date - sometimes with computers it doesn't report on time or your forget.  My suggestions is make your minimum payment at the beginning of the month and then pay the rest off at the end of the month<br>  <br>  2. Use only 75% of your credit limit at any time even if you pay it off at the end of the month.  Raise the limit or get another car if you need it.<br>  <br>  3. Having good credit isn't enough you have to be actively using it.  If you don't use it, it will go in-active.  <br>  <br>  4. Don't cancel your revolving trade lines - just don't use them and eventually they will go inactive.  After 7 years they will disappear of your report.<br>  <br>  5.  To have "established credit" you need to have at least 2 trade lines with a limit around the $2,500 for at least a year.<br>  <br>  6.  The most important thing you can do is to check your credit yearly to make sure there isn't anything on there that shouldn't be.  <br>  <br>  To get your free credit report or for more credit info check out<br>  www.mortgagebrokerrate.com|`|tm4ALVd8aa	This REALLY worked 4 me,  TRUE story- I had NO credit since my bankruptcy in 1983, however I was using the same storage  bin for (12) years & the same apartment for (11) years, also same bank for (7) years, SO-- I requested my storage and apartment landloards,--seperate people to write, sign and notorize a letter(it was the truth)stateing that I had NEVER been a day late with my rent in all those years.

1hciyvKdaa	Mine caught my typo, I was so glad too. It doesnt matter the company really, its your input of data amounts and making sure you answer questions correctly, tubotax or any tax service provides forms, if you do not understand and fill it incorrectly its your fault for not paying for help or getting help by calling the IRS for free. The hang up is the data not matching the expectations of the IRS software. So only you can cause the problem, unless thier system  goes down or something so I wouldnt worry about any errors but your own, the IRS is pretty good at fixing stuff.

She is right, you can't use the Cd for colateral on a loan.<br>  2.  You haven't stated the bank, so there is no way to even estimate the tax and penalty.  Ask for another associate or a manager.  Or, read the original CD document which must spell out the penalties by federal law.  Your taxes will be calculated at the end of the year  - to get an estimate the bank may have the information on the 1099 that you will get, but how it will influence your tax return will be up to your tax advisor.|`|Mx13cbN9aa	dfjdfjdthshjh.hjmmhnhkjhk7965uetbfdgnrdf...|`|AA11960743	If you are not yet 59.5 and you withdraw money from your IRA you will have to add the amount to your income and calculate taxes based on that. <br>  <br>  As well there will be an Additional 10% penalty (here are some exceptions) on the amount you withdraw.

p3vjvzRPaa	I like the fact you are open about it being an assignment and that your question is about getting creative inspiration not having someone do your homework for you :-)<br>  <br>  How you choose what to do will depend on the purpose of the assignment.<br>  <br>  Is it an advertising or marketing class?<br>  <br>  You're possibly being asked to parody an advert to illustrate some of the theory covered in the course so far. So how you do it will depend on what theory it relates to.<br>  <br>  Eg if it relates to ethics in advertising, you could do an ad that blatently tries to encourage children or adults to do something that's bad for them, and does it using pretty dodgy methods...like an advert for McDs that keeps repeating a phrase like "eating junk food will make me happy" and says it will give all obese children an extra thick shake at no extra cost.<br>  <br>  If the theory you have covered relates to the theory of developing an advertisement to appeal to a target audience, well you just do an advert that is obvious and exaggerated in that regard.  Take a real ad for some 'cool' product for teenagers and exaggerate it to show how it tries to relate to the target group and play on their need for social acceptance.<br>  <br>  That's enough waffle from me so I'll leave it at that.<br>  <br>  P.S. there are lots of spoof advertisements on the web - they are parodies.  You may get some inspiration from them. Eg:<br>  <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/gallery/spoofads" rel="nofollow">http://www.adbusters.org/gallery/spoofad...</a>

Any notice that has an even multiple of $300 is most likely regarding the Rebate Recovery Credit that the IRS could not get straight how they wanted those credits handled.

If they don't have an answer, take it to your bank and ask.  They can run tests on it to verify it's real.  It sounds like a scam that will get you in trouble for depositing it.  I'm pretty sure the IRS doesn't make mistakes like that.

3mAgM405aa	It's a very limited survey opportunity which relies heavily on not being tricked into signing up for so-called free offerings, i.e., magazine subscriptions and the like because it's very easy to be charged for these subscriptions when you really do not want to accept their offers--only the payment for answering their surveys.  Should your recordkeeping not be sufficient, you will be bombarded with endless  so-called freebie offerings.  And there's the added bonus if you are able to bring in other new candidates to this program.

But figuring you are in the US, and it is a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy where you are on a repayment plan.<br>  <br>  If you can't wait it out then unfortunately while in your plan in order to get the loan you MUST get the approval of the Trustee.  You may not have to go to "court", as they may just do it through paperwork.  The best thing to do is talk to your lawyer who handled your case as they can go through what is needed to be done. Now if you will be approved is hard to say.  They look at several factors and make a decision as to what they will approve.<br>  <br>  As a side note, it is probably good that the bank stopped it because if the Trustee reviewed your case, which if it is ending soon is a good possibility, and found you had taken out a loan without approval you may have had other issues to deal with.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	If the BK is still pending, you will have difficulty obtaining any loan. that is because they are afraid that the filing could be dismissed, and refiled, including any new (i.e. the auto loan) debt.|`|2gstVBcMaa	If you are bringing in that much money a year...why not save and pay cash for the car and avoid the whole process of going to court to possible get a loan.

Credit is especially tight due to the current economic situations.  If you had something as collateral...a house, luxury boat, another business...that they could take if you failed to repay the loan, then they may consider it.  I doubt this would be very likely as you have no current income and often businesses fail...it would be a big risk.  Some other options would be for another person to guarantee your loan...that would make them responsible for paying it back if you failed to which would be risky for the person.  Or if you have a really great business plan, you may find an investor but only if you could show a good chance at good success.  Lastly, the government itself helps/gives small business loans...so check out the sites below in case there is something you can work with.

DEFINITELY WEAR FLIP FLOPS!<br>  that's all you're gonna be allowed to wear so its great that they see you own a pair vans are okay too but go with flip flops better.<br>  <br>  The interview is a pretty easy thing to nail if you do all the right things. First you should wear hollister. Look very natural and vibe off with the beachy so cal look.One thing i did was wear the colors the hollister employees wear. Ex. Gray, Navy, or White.  BE ON TIME! They would make you wait in the lounge until the interviewer arrives. She would take you to a secluded part of the mall and begin the interview. O yea its a group interview..so you might be with other 5 or 6 people. Always smile and be attentive. They will ask you 4 simple questions. For me it was:<br>  -Name your best quality?<br>  -What does diversity mean to you?<br>  -What are you successful in?<br>  -What makes hollister different from other stores?<br>  I was extremely nervous. But all you have to do answer it as unique as possible. Don't give the usual respond everyone is giving. Be different, make sure the interviewer knows you are different.Also try to give examples when you answer. like say if you are an artistic person. don't just say it, give examples to show that you really are. Speak with clarity, don't mumble or stutter. It will look like you aren't good talking to people. They then tell you they will call u in about a week.

Ask questions as they come into your mind.  Listen carefully to customers and respond to their questions as accurately as possible.

BoAEgaAGaa	You are allowed to amend your 2008 income tax return, after you close on the home,  to claim the first time home buyers credit, if you meet all the requirements.  You will file a form 1040X along with the form 5405.  On the 5405 you will indicate that you have bought the home in 2009 but wish to claim the credit as if you had purchased in 2008.  You will then be eligible for 10% of the price of the purchase of the home, up to $8000.  There are income limitations to this credit also.  <br>  <br>  Then if you keep this as your main home for at least 36 months after purchasing, you will not have to repay the credit.

mwNNs4staa	I think this question would first apply no matter where you live. But to answer your question, its actually depends on several things. If draw a higher income, then you are taxed a higher rate. Obahma is looking to tax those making over $250 K at a higher rate than usual ; eventually those taxpayers will be affected moreover.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you receive a larger refund depends on whether or not you withheld enough tax on your W-4 (of you are a W-2 earner) during that tax year.It also depends on whether or not you have children, and you itemize. These are all variables to factor in on whether or not your rerfund is larger. If you don't have enough withheld then you could end up owing instead of getting back|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	??  Less money than what?<br>  <br>  Higher incomes place people in higher tax brackets, yes.  That means they pay MORE tax.  But how much they 'receive' depends on what they have paid in during the year.<br>  <br>  It almost sounds like you have the tax system backwards.  People PAY taxes, they don't receive them.  If a person receives a tax refund, it is just that, a refund of taxes previously overpaid.<br>  <br>  BTW, almost all modern, western style democracies use a progressive tax system, meaning higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.

Thus no one is withholding anything for fica/mc or taxes.  If she makes $15000 a year, she'll owe $2119 in self-employment taxes...wich is about right for your comment that she pays $100 a month.<br>  <br>  The reason she doesn't get anything back is that she doesn't pay anything in ahead of time.  She isn't eligible for EIC (due to lack of SSN) and the child tax credit doesn't apply if the dependents are 17 or older.<br>  <br>  The number she has SHOULD be an ITIN, not an EIN.  And, yes, we can tell she cleans houses--she can't legally work as a contractor for any firm that is a business.
rjTU3Q9Laa	you probably have a capital loss on the sale of the funds...you can take a maximum of $3,000 in capital losses in any year (that's net losses after any capital gains you may have realized)...distributions are completely separate from the gain/loss on the sales...but you can net any capital gain distributions against the loss from sales...if you don't understand any of this you might want to see a professional.

AA11087625	If you claimed the deduction for tuition and fees on your federal return, you must complete Wisconsin Schedule I before you are able to claim a subtraction for up to $5,114 of qualified tuition and mandatory fees on your state return.<br>  <br>  See page 15, Instructions for State of Wisconsin Income Tax Return<br>  <a href="http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08i-111.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  Schedule I is used to convert your federal adjusted gross income (line 37, form 1040) to the amount allowable for Wisconsin State Income Tax purposes.   <br>  <br>  Instructions Wisconsin Schedule I<br>  <a href="http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08i-128.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  Schedule I<br>  <a href="http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08i-028f.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  From Instructions, page 6, #56 says that the up to $4000 federal deduction for tuition and fees does not apply in Wisconsin and can not be claimed.

Hope this helps.|`|Sa0N4swjaa	There are key differences between what is allowed for your federal return and what is allowed for your state return.  You ARE able to claim the tuition and fees deduction for your FEDERAL return.  However this deduction is NOT allowed on your WISCONSIN state return.<br>  <br>  Wisconsin form 1 (long form) begins with adjusted federal income.  When you completed your federal form there were several deductions that came before you reached your federal AGI, Schedule i adjusts AGI to match Wisconsin's laws on these deductions.  Since the tuition and fees deduction is taken to arrive at federal AGI, Schedule i needs to remove this deduction by adding it back in.<br>  <br>  To summarize what is going on here, the wisconsin state form tries to make their form easier to complete by using numbers that you already calculated on your federal form and adjusting them to meet state laws.  This schedule is an example of one of those adjustments.<br>  <br>  The state does have a deduction for tuition, which would be put on line 11 of Wisconsin form 1, details of which can be found on page 15 of Form 1 instructions.  <br>  <br>  links:<br>  Schedule i instructions (page 9 discusses tuition deductions):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08i-128.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  Schedule i fill in form:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08i-028f.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  Wisconsin Form 1 instructions<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08i-111.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dor.state.wi.us/forms/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps, if you have difficulty completing this schedule I suggest you contact a tax professional.

The4y  somehow fooled themselves into thinking using a credit card was not the same thing as spending money . Often they gave no thought to the interest rate, only if they could afford the monthly payment. They saved no money for reserves in case of emergency instead of the other way around, save money and only pay for needs not wants and use the creit card for emergencies. Then a crisis comes, loss of income, illness and hospital bills, car breaks down and you can't get to work. Then you realize just how much you owe in credit card debt and it's all down hill from there. For the mortgage crisis I believed it started  with President Cinton in 1996 in the form of an ACT that would force mortgage lenders to increase the avaibility of home ownership/home improvements loans within a lower income  to moderate income orgeographical neighborhoods where such investment capital has  generraly been denied. The government monitored these lenders before and after the Act was implemented to determine all mortgage lenders were in compliance. Since these persons had already been declined for a mortgage for bad credit, not enough income, no money for a down payment and various other reasons, but not the neighborhood they lived in.The lenders had to come up with a special loan program that would now allow these same persons to be approved, hence the birth of the sub prime loans. Bush played a role in this fiasco during his administration. Then aong comes Obama who has decided we should bail out these peopled who were now in foreclosure ,with tax payers money, when it was the government that started the foreclosure crisis....without pointing out that it was the government's fault, not predatory lenders, or ARM loans. To me this is typical of how the government handles things and the less interference from the government, in my opinion, the better of we all are.|`|IKakoOfyaa	It depends on where you live and your political leanings as to who is to blame, but really there is no one person or entity or country.

fqycKwuQaa	there are two ways you could start credit one or them is taking out a small personal loan which you might need a parent or an adult to co-sign for you meaning if you do not pay the loan they will. Or you could apply for a credit card for bad or no credit which most likely will get you approved no matter what, but if you are a student you could get a student credit card which will offer you lower rates and no annual fees, check out www.fastcreditcardapprovals.com but if you have applied for different cards most likely you have been applying for the wrong one so make sure you apply for a no credit card which will have a higher interest rate with an annual fee but use it for a few months just enough to build some credit then you could get a better card and drop your first one.|`|UtwcSsfpaa	You might try getting a store-specific credit card. Charge a MANAGEABLE amount onto it, and pay it off.<br>  Do this for a few months.

My daughter does coding, so I called her up, that particular problem I had (huge pain on right side of neck, that paralized my neck completely) only had two possible options, and nether really fit the situation.My daughter told me, in this intance the only thing I could do, was to write in a clear and very descriptive explanation of what happend how it felt etc etc etc, and the comments by the attending physician and what treatements and suggestions for future help were. I did not aks her for a long time, I think she was still in college at that time. I just didnt pay it bad me. Anyhow, what was weird was a month later I went to my Dr for the same thing but it was just not as bad, and he put me in for physical therapy, they had me come in 3 times a week for a month, and my ins company paid for all of that!!!!! I would a, go into the Drs office if you can, b, write a letter to your insurance carrier, what they do with that letter is they have meetings with prof staff at that ins company and discuss requests for payments submitted by patients and can over turn a non payment. They cant magically know all the detail on a simple code, so do thier work for them let them know whats going on, be professional and easy to understand, point out facts not feelings and you might get this over turned. My daughter told me that it happens alot, and how bad I meessed up not understanding how insurance works. I asked her, besides you hun, how am I suppose to learn all this stuff? She said, I dont know! Good luck.

It will ask you all the relevant tax questions clearly so that you can answer accurately.  <br>  <br>  The upside of doing your taxes using TurboTax instead of going to an H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt type of place is that your tax preparer won't try to add extra deductions - that don't actually apply to you - into your taxes in order to get a bigger commission or anything -- while extra deductions sound great as far as your refund amount, if your tax preparer finagles you some extra money by claiming something that isn't truthful, you could end up being audited and have to pay back the amount of the extra deductions plus interest.<br>  <br>  So I would actually say that TurboTax is the BEST way to go, unless you are a CPA yourself!|`|AA12196955	I found Turbo Tax very easy to use and consider it as safe as anything else we do these days. <br>  You might want to check out TaxACT Online which is free.

Also, it doesn't look good when you are carrying a balance so close to your limit.  It detracts from your overall score.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Yes... your limit on the card is 500 - right now you have $5 of that limit left and are on the way to ruin your credit....<br>  <br>  Pay that 495 off immediately and from now on you don't use more than 30% of your credit limit in a billing cycle.<br>  <br>  Maxing a card out will hurt your credit score.... even if you pay it off when the bill comes.<br>  <br>  P.S. Never go that high... they add interest charges to your balance and that can put you over your limit and result in a hefty overdraft fee.|`|5f297977fd704bd8099a65707f996f59aa	The amount you can charge depends on the amount you pay.

FUpjkAowaa	Depending if its in the city or not you can get a rural development loan.  Probably not immediately, though.  and the house may not qualify.  You should have a parent or grandparent of close family member that you trust and that trusts you to co-sign for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and to build your credit, o a local CREDIT UNION, and if you have been at your current job at least 3 months (sometimes 6 months) you can get a starter loan (usually about $200).  Meant to build your credit.  It takes six months for it to count on your credit.  If you pay it off early, it doesnt count though.  But its GREAT for building credit.<br>  <br>  DOWN PAYMENT--Usually minimum down payment is 20%.  But that depends on what mortgage company you go through.  Could possiblly be lower.  If I calculated right it would be a $7,600 down payment.|`|AA10154955	If you have no credit history you will likely need a co-signer of the loan. Normally a parent. You would purchase the home and make the payments, but should you stop paying the bank could go after the co-signer.<br>  <br>  With no credit or job history this may be your only approach.<br>  <br>  You could try and get pre-approved for a loan. This shouldn't cost anything and the lender will let you know what exactly you need to do to qualify.<br>  <br>  Likely will need 10% down or $3k plus $500 for closing costs. Mortgage on 27k would be <br>  10 - $300 per month (plus taxes and insurance $100-200 month)<br>  15 - $230 per month (plus taxes and insurance $100-200 month)<br>  30 - $161 per month (plus taxes and insurance $100-200 month)

yYEYl2eXaa	It is unlikely you will get a job without a face to face interview. The best option is to apply for jobs now and set up interviews for the first couple of weeks you arrive in Australia. You can provide the prospective employers with a detailed resume or CV, references, cover letter etc via e-mail which will help to secure the interview. Give specific dates that you will be available for interviews once you arrive in Australia and make sure you have a number of interviews set up when you get there.

wzM5WB8Xaa	If you made it to the second interview, then you obviously said something to impress them in the first one. Payroll and stuff really is simple to learn, so don't worry too much about that part of the interview. I learned it in a 2 week period to take over for a maternity leave (while still doing my other job). Just make sure that the person interviewing you knows that you are detail oriented and organized. Draw on your experience with your past position as a small scale type of thing as opposed to an unrelated job. Also, ask about the company's policy on upgrading your education. It will show that you are looking at getting more knowledge and experience. Just relax. I felt the same way when I was up for my first management position, and I got it because they could see that I was enthusiastic, intelligent, and great with people, even though I had no experience in the area.|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Try to stay as calm as possible<br>  Do not ramble on with answers. Be direct and specific.<br>  Do not fidgit; i.e. show nervousness<br>  Inquire about the history of the company, this shows interest|`|7r4paUFhaa	Well, DO NOT talk badly about yourself, or say anything that would make you sound unsure about your ability to do the job. You DO have experience as a "manager", it was just called "lead". You say you are confident that you can handle the job, you are willing and able to learn, and as far as the college degree goes, you have equivalent "on the job" experience. Also, no matter how laid back the office seems, make sure you dress appropriately for an interview, don't chew gum, etc. Good luck!
AA11573642	Yes. It began with  the beginning of armed conflict between Huthi rebels and the government in the northern Yemeni governorate of Sa’da in 2004. They began as the Zaidi Shi’a religious revivalist movement, the Believing Youth, in the 1990s under the leadership of Husain al-Huthi.<br>  The conflict continues till now in one form or another.
DF22BQ3yaa	You will have to not let it bother you. The BOSS is the one in charge; can hire and fire. You need your job. I know it's tough but do what's expected and go home at the end of the day.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Start looking now because she ain't gonna change. Women in any position of authority frequently have this snotty self centered attitude and enjoy their little bit of power and abuse it. I will never work for any woman again, they are horrible in the workplace.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You will always find someone like that at your job.

Commiserate with others about her, then go back to work.|`|ot1ZZexeaa	Definitely do not commiserate with others about this manager. That kind of talk always comes back to haunt you. And in this economy, someone might sell you out to save their own hide. <br>  <br>  Besides, it's perfectly within a manager's right to ask about the conversations of her subordinates. If they are work related then she will have feedback, and if they aren't, then those conversations need to only be happening during breaks, lunches and off time. So a good manager does keep her eyes and ears on her staff. Their behavior reflects on her.<br>  <br>  The best way to work with a manager who has poor boundaries and behaves inappropriately is to make sure your work is impeccable and document all instances of inappropriate behavior, which is connected to work productivity. I'm afraid many of those traits, if not connected to the manager's performance aren't really issues you can resolve. Conduct issues are subjective and there might even be folks who find this person harmless or actually pleasant. <br>  <br>  Since you've already stated finding another job is not a desirable outcome, you need to learn to accept the managers shortcomings and try to manage your own feelings and resentments. Having had managers like the one you described I can assure you, you are easier to replace than see it. And in most cases they'd rather replace the lower wage worker than the supervisor.

59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	More importantly than law school--you don't sound like you're cut out to be a lawyer.  The vast majority of what lawyers do is reading and writing.  Some lawyers never see the inside of a court room.  Of those who do, the vast majority spend dozens of times more hours in preparation (again, reading and writing) then they do in court.  <br>  <br>  Now, that being said, if you can make it through law school, that doesn't mean you ahve to be a lawyer.  Somewhere around 50% of people with law degrees aren't lawyers within 5 years of graduating.  Law school opens up all sorts of opportunities.  But, yes, you will be expected to read hundreds of pages daily.  You will have to argue and defend your points both out loud and in writing. Your grades will be based mostly upon one test or paper at the end of class, where you not only have to show all of the knowledge you've gained, but apply that knowledge creatively to new situations in extended writing.    Papers tend to range in the 10-30 page range.  <br>  <br>  Talk to someone who went to law school, and talk to a lawyer.   Have them tell you what it was like.|`|WYjbuu6saa	No, it doesn't sound like it.<br>  <br>  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in.  We simply have WAY TOO MANY Attorneys - we have a GLUT of Lawyers!<br>  <br>  Suggestion:  IF you want a job when you are done with your studies, consider and look into the field of HEALTHCARE! <This is where the jobs are! and scholarships!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CUkz5EIMaa	Law firms are laying off big time right now.  Law firms themselves are typically not for creative people.  There is major butt kissing and long hours required to succeed.  Make sure this is something you really really want to do.|`|sE17TXzxaa	no, because you are a girl.|`|b6cPtJ6haa	Lawyers are a dime a dozen, go medical. Heck, there is a shortage of pharmacists and their median wage is $98,000K well above lawyers. Dentists 180,000K median and there is a shortage, and of course a shortage of MDs.<br>  <br>  From US News, Poor careers for 2006<br>  Attorney. If starting over, 75 percent of lawyers would choose to do something else. A similar percentage would advise their children not to become lawyers. The work is often contentious, and there's pressure to be unethical. And despite the drama portrayed on TV, real lawyers spend much of their time on painstakingly detailed research. In addition, those fat-salaried law jobs go to only the top few percent of an already high-powered lot.<br>  <br>  Many people go to law school hoping to do so-called public-interest law. (In fact, much work not officially labeled as such does serve the public interest.) What they don't teach in law school is that the competition for those jobs is intense. I know one graduate of a Top Three law school, for instance, who also edited a law journal. She applied for a low-paying job at the National Abortion Rights Action League and, despite interviewing very well, didn't get the job.<br>  <br>  From the Associated Press, MADISON, Wis. (AP) - A lawmaker who persuaded the Assembly to eliminate all state funding for the University of Wisconsin law school says his reasoning is simple: There's too many lawyers in Wisconsin.<br>  <br>  From an ABA study about malpractice claims, More Sole Practicioners: There appears to be an increasing trend toward sole practicioners, due partly to a lack of jobs for new lawyers, but also due to increasing dissatisfaction among experienced lawyers with traditional firms; leading to some claims which could have been avoided with better mentoring.<br>  <br>  New Lawyers: Most insurers have noticed that many young lawyers cannot find jobs with established firms, and so are starting their own practices without supervision or mentoring. This is likely to cause an increase in malpractice claims, although the claims may be relatively small in size due to the limited nature of a new lawyers<br>  <br>  “In a survey conducted back in 1972 by the American Bar Association, seventy percent of Americans not only didn’t have a lawyer, they didn’t know how to find one. That’s right, thirty years ago the vast majority of people didn’t have a clue on how to find a lawyer. Now it’s almost impossible not to see lawyers everywhere you turn."<br>  <br>  Growth of Legal Sector<br>  Lags Broader Economy; Law Schools Proliferate<br>  For graduates of elite law schools, prospects have never been better. Big law firms this year boosted their starting salaries to as high as $160,000. But the majority of law-school graduates are suffering from a supply-and-demand imbalance that's suppressing pay and job growth. The result: Graduates who don't score at the top of their class are struggling to find well-paying jobs to make payments on law-school debts that can exceed $100,000. Some are taking temporary contract work, reviewing documents for as little as $20 an hour, without benefits. And many are blaming their law schools for failing to warn them about the dark side of the job market.<br>  <br>  The law degree that Scott Bullock gained in 2005 from Seton Hall University -- where he says he ranked in the top third of his class -- is a "waste," he says. Some former high-school friends are earning considerably more as plumbers and electricians than the $50,000-a-year Mr. Bullock is making as a personal-injury attorney in Manhattan. To boot, he is paying off $118,000 in law-school debt.<br>  <br>  A slack in demand appears to be part of the problem. The legal sector, after more than tripling in inflation-adjusted growth between 1970 and 1987, has grown at an average annual inflation-adjusted rate of 1.2% since 1988, or less than half as fast as the broader economy, according to Commerce Department data.<br>  <br>  On the supply end, more lawyers are entering the work force, thanks

4RjM5lElaa	Well, why did you resign?  Was it bcz the job made you feel edgy?  Did you hate what you were doing?  <br>  <br>  It's admirable to take time off to learn cool things - if you can support yourself w/o an issue while you do this, then great.  But when you are ready to go back to work what are you going to say?  'I took time off to learn...' what?  If it has relevance to the working world then it's a plus, if it doesn't then folks will question why you left.<br>  Why not get a job but in something that you enjoy - and learn new things while you get paid - and then spend your off time learning as well?
C2lnIOSQaa	I am an atty and while I can't give you legal advice without knowing all the facts (disclaimer), the situation you describe sounds like a scam, as others have pointed out.  I would try to find out as much as you can and then report it to the state atty general, as others have also recommended.<br>  <br>  Based on what you say, it sounds like the caller may have access to your credit report, which is concerning.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the things he said that don't compute:<br>  -  Debt collection is a civil matter, not a criminal matter.  So nobody is found "guilty" in a debt collection case, which an atty would know. (So you do not have a right to a court-appointed lawyer, either.)  A defendant in a debt collection case is either found liable for the debt for a certain amount of $$, or not liable for the debt.<br>  - A summons is issued at the beginning of a case, not after it is decided.  A judgment or "order of judgment" is what would result at the end of a debt collection case.<br>  - Sheriffs are used in many areas to serve summons, but if that happens, he just hands you the paper and walks away.  He can't arrest you for a debt you owe.<br>  -  A creditor would likely try to get you to pay before going to the expense of hiring a lawyer, paying court costs and getting a judgment against you.  Once he has a judgment from a court, he has nothing to gain by haggling with you over the phone.<br>  <br>  In the unlikely event you do get served a summons or a copy of a judgment, try a local legal aid society to find an atty to help you.  Or you could decide to represent yourself.  One of the reasons that court cases take so dang long is that courts hate it when people are surprised, so if you did not receive notice that a debt collection case is pending, you could fight it.<br>  <br>  In case there is an unpaid debt out there you are not aware of, you might want to get a copy of your credit report and review it.<br>  <br>  I hope this answer calms your anxiety about this.  Best of luck.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	That's BS, but sadly standard practice for some of these companies.  Any court summons requires that you be properly served.  If you've never been served for a civil matter, there couldn't have been any finding against you.  Speak to your own attorney immediately, and find out who's calling and what's going on.  It's possible that someone is guilty of a criminal federal offense, and they could go to jail for a long time for that.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Sounds like BS to me.  A lot of what he said is a flat out lie.

If it is being reported you should send them a certified letter demanding that they Validate the debt. They have 30 days to PROVE that the debt belongs to you. If they cant they must go away! This is your right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.<br>  <br>  If it is not being reported on your credit report and he continues to call simply inform him that you have not received a "Dunning Letter" from him and any further attempt to collect is illegal!<br>  <br>  Get his name , company name and address. If they do not provide you with a Dunning Letter explaining the debt and your rights then you should send them a certified letter demanding that they Cease and Desist all collection efforts.<br>  <br>  I know all of this sounds confusing? You can use an online system at www.MyCreditABC.com to help you enforce your rights!|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	Well, first of all alot of what he told you is crap. sounds like a collection agency scam to get you to pay them for debt you don't have.<br>  <br>  However, he is correct in that the courts will not provide you with an attorney.

Google his name. See what comes up.|`|5BTKscZraa	This is almost certainly just a debt collector pretending to be an attorney when this is not the case.  Debt collectors will often pretend to be (or represent) attorneys to scare you into paying them. This is a violation of federal law. To confirm if this is a “real” legal threat, ask for their attorney’s full name and license number in the state bar association. Call your state bar association to confirm this info.  If they refuse to give this info to you, then the legal threat is probably a bluff.<br>  --------------<br>  This is the USA, not Nazi Germany where people were found guilty before they received due process.  Yes, debt collectors have access to your name and SS#...they get this info when they buy your debt from the original creditor. It doesn't mean that they have special rights or that they've already won some sort of legal action.....Debt collectors LOVE to scare people with bogus threats of arrest and lawsuits.<br>  <br>  When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.<br>  <br>  Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt (do not use regular mail) stating:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt, including a copy of the original signed application with my signature<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  * DO NOT sign your signature on any document that you mail to a debt collector. It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.<br>  <br>  When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.<br>  <br>  Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation. Do not let them scare you with bogus threats during this period. This will give you breathing time to explore your options.<br>  --------------------------|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Somebody is full of crap, whether you really had the card or not. CitiBank would have told you about it themselves. If you were already found guilty of it believe me you would have gotten letter after letter for it. They're some kind of illegal crap trying to scare you into getting an account with them to "save" you from debt. Have they tried to offer you any promotional deals yet? They will if they're trying to get money. Someone calls here all the time and tries to tell me I have bad credit. I tell them that's funny because I've never heard of your company (even if I have), then they have to come up with how they got my number in the first place. It really shouldn't matter what state your in either, because credit collectors call from everywhere trying to get money.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If they have your ssn and other information, they're probably some company who "bought" your information from someone like a gas card or other small company. Just don't bother with them unless you actually do get a letter from the police department or Citibank themselves. I don't think they even have the right to harrass you like that. They just look up information on random names sometimes and yours was probably one they thought they'd try. Somehow, they got it from a place that doesn't secure your info, and it was probably someone that doesn't get a whole lot of legit business in the first place.<br>  <br>  EDIT (again): Ask this clown if he would mind telling you how you already were found guilty and never properly served. That is funny how that happened because there has to be a case of something before someone is found guilty of it. They did not already decide your guilty of something if they didn't even serve you papers on it. Without serving you, there is not even a case to be found guilty of. Nothing gets away from a credit company for 3 years. Tell them that since they have all the information to look you up, you would like some to find out about their ratings for yourself. Get a phone number, address, names, websites, and anything else you could google. See what comes up. If nothing comes up, he's nothing to even worry about. If something does, check into it. It's probably just some crap trying to save you from debt, but they really don't send your money toward your debt, they just keep it for themselves. It actually makes your credit worse because they do a credit check and that brings your credit score down. Also, it adds a card and money owed to your debt. If you're supposed to pay them 500 a month to help your credit and you don't pay one month, they'll just add it to the bills. Don't try that.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Order your credit reports.  You are entitled to one free per year from each of the big three credit reporting agencies.  The site is annualcreditreport.com.  See what's there from Citibank.  That will answer the question as to whether there's anything owed to Citibank.<br>  <br>  Now, this guy talked out of both sides of his mouth and screwed up his terminology.  No one is found guilty of owing money - they are found liable.  Also, if you were "found guilty," there's no need to summon you to court.  So he's full of crap.<br>  <br>  It sounds like there may be a debt and Citibank may be contemplating a lawsuit.  If you are sued in civil court, you will not get an attorney.  That's only done in criminal cases.  However, it probably doesn't matter since you have no defense if the debt is actually owed.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you find that there's an unpaid debt to Citibank, demand that they validate the debt.  Once you get that, see if you can negotiate a reduced settlement amount.

You are also correct  that not all credit cards bolster your credit score. Many  companies do not report to the credit bureaus. many  that do report that it is a secured card, which  will adversely effect your credit score, even if you have a good payment record. If you find a credit card company that will report to the credit bureau without describing it as a secured card and you have a good payment record that will raise your credit score.  Check with the credit card company before you get a secured credit card just to get a higher credit score to see if the report to credit bureaus and if the card is shown to be secured.|`|wSlerVuQaa	Old navy very likely will improve your credit.

9WAtB40aaa	yes of course! Just get a casual job and keep writing like maybe 1 or 2 pages a day or more depending on how much you really want to. try and get it published when you're done. most novels a between 80,000 and 120,000 words so just keep at it. send it to as much publishers as possible, mainly the ones that publish books of the same genre as yours. if it doesn't get published, ask the publishers for tips and why they didn't publish and what you could change. if it does get published. keep your job until the money starts rolling in and if your confident that your second one will be just as successful, if not more just be a full time writer.<br>  <br>  if this doesn't work for you, you can always try self publishing, which means your book will published and up for sale but it will be a bit costy as you will need to do the printing and marketing yourself.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|XKhNw221aa	it's a really saturated market, but if you become a shadow writer, then maybe.|`|CDymqY65aa	At first, probably not.

AA10469473	You should do whatever gives you the higher deduction, but you can only deduct medical expenses that are over 7.5% of your income, so much of those insurance premiums won't be deductible.  And the use of your phone and internet for the project doesn't mean it's ALL deductible, just the part of the Internet cost that's business use. If the phone is your only line, it isn't deductible at all.  And business expenses that are for a job as an employee, with a W-2, are only deductible for the part that's over 2% of your AGI.  With 2 W-2's, especially if you got unemployment for the 6 months, it's pretty likely that your allowable deductions will be under the standard deduction of $5450.  But calculate what your deductions would be.<br>  <br>  Your question is a little confusing - you say you work as an IT consultant, but say you got W-2's.

From the information you provided, you had a home office plus you incurred expenses to earn the money.  Your home office is a valuable deduction.  Your medical insurance is deductible on the front of the 1040 as an adjustment to your income if you did not have a loss. You should have Sch A, and a Sch C based on just the information you gave.

It never works..|`|D19F6m92aa	16 and a swing manager, you must be responsible.<br>  first, do not get on a power trip, be polite, be respectful, but also be firm.  This lady has issues with all managers, not only you.  However she sees you as vulnerable, so she will act out on your shift.  Talk to your manager, maybe they can transfer her to another shift.  <br>  Otherwise, be strictly accountable with her and build your case.  "I asked you to clean the ladies room three times, before you did it.  I asked you two times to mop the floor after that kid spilled his drink.  You know we have to clean up after spills, you should have gotten the mop with out anyone asking you to."  <br>  Sometimes, it best to just call it a day.

If she won't listen to her superiors (which is you, wether you are 25 years younger or not) then she deserves to be written up! If she won't do her job, or if she is verbally abusing ANYONE she should be written up, and it will be HER fault if she loses her job, and not yours! Do the right thing and follow through with normal procedure, if she is stupid enough to continue with her verbal assults then that is her own fault. By the way, id you don't do it, the next manager thats younger than her Will, because she will do the same to them. I think its only fair that she gets what anyone else would get for being rude and not doing what she is asked. <br>  And even if she is great at the position she works, there are many other people who would be great at it too! Do the right thing. For all you know you're not the only person she speaks down too. She may even make other staff members feel like ****, so.. do the right thing. She deserves to be treated just as anyone else would.

Create a website with digital models of what houses you've designed would look like complete and options they could have or things the consumer could change about it. And it would be pretty cool because I wouldn't have to do any of the work building it, just have fun designing it. But you do have to pay your workers although the work you do is good pay, at average for interior design, if your good is $56,000 a year and for architect $58,500 or something like that if your in with a company. It all depends on your skill and talent. But if you become self employed and people like your taste you get way more. It's kinda cool that into this too. You can do both jobs at once at your house or something and it could still be considered one job to you and make the same if not more than a surgeon.

The regimen of attending classes, interacting with students and teachers in a controlled environment, studying outside the classroom to be able to bring back to the classroom your won point of view, all add up to rounding out your personality, which is the MAIN skill you can offer without getting a four-year college degree.

vWFz82heaa	You should apply anyway but you must state very clearly that the employer did not schedule you for 7 weeks straight and provide them with information from the date of your last paycheck and the time you quit. Being unpaid and not schedule for a month and a half is tantamount to being laidoff. Also, give the EDD people the information that the rest of the employees were laid off 2 weeks after you quit, which meant that the company was postponing laidoffs as a means of getting workers to quit to not pay unemployment. <br>  The strongest argument you can make is that you were not working for 7 week straight. Go apply for unemployment.|`|AaXMbPgpaa	It is possible you could get unemployment but probably not. Normally when an employee quits or what is called voluntary termination, they are not eligible for unemployment unless they quit for cause.

The GST is a credit given to people resident in Canada to help off-set the amount of GST that you pay throughout the year.  If you don't live here, you aren't speding money on GST and are not entitled to the credit.<br>  <br>  The CCTB is a way for all Canadians to help each other by giving a credit to help children in Canada.  If your children are not living here, they do not qualify to receive this amount. <br>  <br>  If you are still on the Provincial plan, then you can be certain that the government hasn't been notified.  Our system of medicare is for people living in Canada, and is paid for by everyone.  <br>  <br>  You are required to file in both countries if you have not severed your ties to Canada, and if you are earning income in Canada.

So I did lose health coverage and all canadian benefits.  You've been there since 2006, so have you filed any taxes in the past 2 yrs? if your still a canadian resident under revenue canada guidelines then you will need to file taxes in both countries and pay some taxes in both locations. The tax treaty between US and canada will help. I suggest you get in touch with a tax advisor to help you along. <br>  <br>  The non-resident canadian guidelines include owning canadian property, having a bank account in canada and any other financial ties to canada, etc.
RhEhzGbraa	Unfortunately there is no easy solution to your case. The only central database that would enable you to find out who she applied for coverage with--MIB (Medical Information Bureau) keeps track of all applications for life insurance policies including name of company and amount applied for.   However, MIB records only go back 13 years and must be accessed by an Executor, Administrator or other eligible relative.  You can contact MIB at <a href="http://www.mibsolutions.com/lost-life-insurance/." rel="nofollow">http://www.mibsolutions.com/lost-life-in...</a><br>  <br>  As far as I know if you are the Executor of the Estate you can access bank records to see who she paid for life insurance if MIB doesn't have the record. The other alternative is that she might have had a safety deposit box at the bank that you might not be aware of. If you are the Executor you should be able to 1) find out if she had a box and 2) if she did the bank will let you open it. ??I can also suggest that you check with the HR Department at her job since she might have made you a beneficiary on her life policy at work. If not also check with her auto and homeowners agent--he or she might be the same person who wrote the life insurance or might have referred her to the person. Also if she had an accountant or the family attorney try checking with them since she might have given them the information while writing her will or checking tax implications of the life policy. Also the attorney might be able to come up with another way to check assets. Did your ex-wife fill out a Net Worth Statement for anything recently--the information would be listed there.??If there are no other options, you are left with calling companies individually. However, be forewarned the last information I had was that there are over 1800 life insurance companies in the U.S. alone and over a 15 year period many of them might have changed names as a result of mergers, etc. If you have to go this route, first go to the insurance commissioner for your state and have them give you a list of the companies licensed in your state, i.e. not all companies are licensed in every state then with the list first think of the top names of insurance companies on the list--the companies that have the most name recognition and start by calling them, i.e. New York Life, Metropolitan Life, Mutual of Omaha, Sun Life, TransAmerica Life, AIG, Prudential, Northwestern Mutual, Pacific Life, etc. ??In short this is a daunting task, my bet is that she had a safety deposit box or was covered at work. ??<br>  <br>  I am very sorry for your loss. Good luck!|`|xb255X0faa	The key is to find out what company she had the insurance with.  At that point you can just call them up, say you think you are a beneficiary on your ex-wife's insurance, and they can look her up by her name and birthday usually.  <br>  <br>  So call local agents or companies that you think may have sold her the policy or search through old bank and credit card records to see if you can find out what company she had the insurance with.  If she applied for it in the last 13 years you can use the MIB policy locater service that another answerer mentioned.|`|WCZLDvJBaa	You can ask for a duplicate policy or just call customer service of the insurance company.

If your shift starts at 7am normally, and you have a 5am meeting, they can move your shift 2 hours up to compensate.

ea99b42c335996f23f115607a67795f5aa	With this economy, I would recommend not starting your business. At the moment no one will be able to buy anything that is not a staple, especially organic items. At the moment, people are going for the cheapest and easiest things to get, so unless you are cheaper than the name brands and are as easily accessible as a supermarket, you should try when the economy gets better. And even with an online store, people aren't going to buy (who wants to pay for shipping when they can get something similar at the market for a whole lot less?) Also, with the lack of money you guys have, maybe you should just wait it out. In a few years, America is going to be the same, or even better, than before this depression. But don't give up on that dream! That is the most important thing. Thank you for reading this and I hope you consider using my thoughts.|`|iBqAJgwPaa	This is merely my opinion.<br>  With the current state of the economy, risks are hard to take. While starting up your own business ensures job stability, it does not necessarily provide dividends. I would say that if this is a skill that your family is extremely good at, then start of by trying to sell your product to stores that sell candles and soaps and what not. Once your brand establishes credibility and brings in a bit of money, then venture into selling through a website. Ultimately this would allow you to get your dream store. I can't ensure success but I do think these are very common steps to any new business model. Wish you and your family the best.

Your best bet is to start an LLC, depending on where you live it can be super cheap, in NM its only 50$ and get your business license from your county. Plus, there is sales tax of, atleast 5% and your county bumps it up most likely to 7% of anything you SELL not profit. It sounds like a lot of work because it is. But, it is very rewarding.

jXI1Vwuhaa	========================================...<br>  Getting Traffic on your Blog/Website<br>  ======================================...<br>  1. The fact is that best of the traffic comes from search engines directly by searching your blog related terms, so the most important part of your advertisement must be getting listed in search engines. But remember only major search engines, don't bother about submitting in 350,000 search engines as 99% searches are made in top 3 search engines only and 60% in Google only. Also if you waste your time submitting your content in many search engines, it may depress your favourability in top search engines.<br>  (Best way to automatically include your stuff is using directories, see step 2)( See resources list ).<br>  <br>  2. List your blogs or websites in relevant directories in most relevant category. Directories are good source of traffic as well as they increase the visibility of your website for top search engines. But again don't bother to submit your websites to 1000s of directories and don't use any service ( free or paid ) or any software which does the same thing. ( See resources list ).<br>  <br>  3. Use Pay Per Click advertising. It is best hassle free way to get traffic but not for beginners. An expert draws maximum Targetted visitors out of low budget while newbies may waste a lot of money for generating useless traffic only which doesn't make any good to your business. Before trying PPC make your you have done enough "Keyword Analysis" Search Google for Adwords Keyword Analysis. ( See resources list ).Google's Adwords and Yahoo's Search Engine Marketing & MSN's Adcenter are best programs. Search for Discount coupons if you find none for free contact me.( See resources list ).<br>  <br>  4. Purchase paid reviews, It improves both Traffic & Search Engine ranks. It almost boost your search engine rankings. ( See resources list ).<br>  <br>  5. Submit your business in free classifieds like Craigslist. ( See resources list ).<br>  <br>  6. Hire an SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) expert or learn by yourself how to optimize your website to get better ranking in search results for your blog related terms. getting into first page is necessary as 90% of searchers don't go beyond first page, and 70% don't go beyond first five results.<br>  <br>  7. Make your blog a brand. Use catchy graphics fast loading pages, beautiful banners. let your visitor feel to bookmark your website so that he may come ( or probably purchase later )<br>  <br>  8. Use Social bookmarking websites to spread your articles. periodically write useful and fresh articles and make them popular in interested people. it will improve all brand, traffic, customers and search engine positions. ( See resources list ).<br>  <br>  9. Always write fresh articles most blogging websites have an automatic Ping method which notifies about your new posts to search engines. So keep posting being stick to your Blog's theme. Means don't post cricket news on your blog related to mobile models.<br>  <br>  10. Last but not the least. Never try black hat methods you will get black listed and will loose potential search traffic instantaneously. Never try anything which says improve your search engine rank very fast or very high. remember always that anything which seems too good to be true is never true.|`|AA12390652	Your website looks so flat, it does not have any depth of services and it is not captivating also. first get re-design the website, then you should promote it through link sharing with social portal like google, yaho and other many more, also the young people's clubs and friendship and networking sites. you can use paid promotion, SEO service to promote your website.<br>  for more information and professional services, just log in to freemankpo.com|`|3bSxqyDSaa	To get traffic to your site you need to start building back links.

Since you have a little free time, why not visit a 'no consultation fee' lawyer and let them determine if you have a case.   Legally, employers can cut employee hours.  But are they reducing other employee's as well, or is it only you?  Have they put in place a hiring shutdown, are they cutting back any other perks?

If lack of business is the reason for your reduction of hours this could be a viable reason and difficult to dispute.  Some questions that will need to be answered include:<br>  <br>  - How many other employees work there?<br>  - How many others had their hours reduced?<br>  - Has business really been slow?<br>  - Is there an agreement to increase your hours when business picks up?<br>  - Do you have an employment agreement stating that you are full-time?<br>  <br>  Depending on the answers to these questions it may not matter that you could possibly be entitled to benefits regardless of whether they cut your hours or not.  Like I said, it depends on what state you live in.<br>  <br>  You're best bet is to contact your State Department of Labor.  Typically, it is not legal to reduce hours solely to prevent an ill / handicapped employee from receiving health benefits.  They can steer you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  (Note:  If this was a pre-existing condition that you opted not to disclose then they may not be required to provide health benefits for it regardless of your hours.)

DorePwVOaa	Vanguard is my personal fave. They offer index funds with some of the lowest expense ratios in the business. The only downside to Vanguard is that they require a $3,000 minimum to start investing in most of their funds. If you can't meet that minimum, Fidelity and T Rowe Price are two others that are good, and will waive the minimum if you sign up to contribute at least $50-$100 every month.<br>  <br>  ETFs can track indexes and be very similar to index funds. The only difference between an index ETF and an index fund is that index funds have a fixed price for the day you buy them (the closing price for that day is the price you pay) and an ETF's price fluctuates all day long, like a stock, and you pay whatever the price is for the moment you buy it.

This shouldn't cost anything and the lender will let you know what exactly you need to do to qualify.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	You'll have to wait until you have:<br>  <br>  1. A minimum of a 2-year credit history with a minimum of 4 trade lines.<br>  <br>  2. Two years of full-time work experience generating enough income to qualify.  Future rent income cannot be used to qualify for a loan.<br>  <br>  Smart Investors also have a real estate license.<br>  <br>  It's that simple.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You really are not in the position to do this.<br>  <br>  There is a down payment, and a mortgage with taxes and insurance to be considered. Currently, most banks want 20 percent down, plus proof of adequate income. What worked for your parents is pretty useless in the current market, which is now glutted with unsold homes and foreclosures. <br>  <br>  You will not need merely credit, but a substantial amount of down, and a regular income.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YtK477RYaa	Use your parents as co-signers
Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes.  Go to the school nearest to your home or work. They both teach exactly the same thing: the answers to the questions on the state licensing test. Neither will help you get ahead in your realty career..
p3vjvzRPaa	A few fairly random thoughts...<br>  <br>  Depends on what country and area you live in. Marketing graduates have fairly high rates of employment in many places.<br>  <br>  In a recession some companies recognise that they have to market more effectively to stay afloat, some unfortunately think that if they cut back in areas like 'marketing' they'll save money.  Overall, I think there are plenty of smart organisations out there wanting quality marketing staff.<br>  <br>  Market researcher are usually in very high demand.<br>  <br>  Many graduates end up in sales roles as their first step.  <br>  <br>  Here's a list of marketing-type jobs:<br>  <br>  Account executive <br>  Brand manager <br>  Product manager <br>  Business analyst<br>  Business development manager <br>  Public relations officer <br>  Customer service manager<br>  Events promoter<br>  Sales manager<br>  Fund raising officer <br>  Marketing analyst<br>  Sponsorship manager<br>  Market researcher <br>  Marketing communications manager<br>  Promotions officer <br>  Marketing manager <br>  Media liaison coordinator <br>  Publicity officer <br>  Merchandiser<br>  Pricing analyst<br>  Sales executive|`|1nnW8cCjaa	Unfortunately, the job market generally these days is not good.

There is no estate duty in India now.  So any amount or property received after the death, will not attract any tax on the principle amount.  So no tax on principle amount.<br>  <br>  Regarding interest, till the death of your mother the interest earned on that will be your mother's income and the tax if any will be charged on your mothers last assessment. <br>  <br>  From the date of death of your mother the interest earned on that FDs will be added to your income and you will have to pay the tax.

You can always ask for feedback if you are unsuccessful, and treat it as a learning experience.
Ch9TedMcaa	Certificate of deposit<br>  <br>  The fee for early withdrawal is 10% plus tax, so you won't be tempted to do it.|`|PxoKseAiaa	CD's<br>  There is a penalty if you do try to withdraw before the term is up.|`|pTbK57Xaaa	Yes a CD or certificate of depost. requires that your money stay in the bank until a predetermined maturity date. The benefit is that CDs typically pay higher interest than general savings account.<br>  <br>  If you withdraw early you will be charged a penalty. Check into that before you sign!<br>  <br>  Lets say you have a 5 year CD (it can be as low as 3 months). If at the end of those 5 years you don't want to take the money out you can simply renew the CD for another length of time.|`|AA10154955	Yup...<br>  <br>  CDs...Certificate of Deposit.<br>  <br>  This is how they work<br>  <br>  You put in a certain amount and get a return of interest.

P3e2kJtwaa	Nursing is amazing.  Obviously, it's not for everyone.  You have to be a people person (or learn to become one).  I used to be pretty shy, but now I can talk to any random stranger about anything (socializing is a skill you can learn on the job).  <br>  It's hard to tell you what your typical day would be like, because it depends on what floor you work on.  Lots of medications, friendly (and not so friendly) patients and coworkers, IV fluids, body fluids around every corner haha.<br>  There may be difficult family situations, people who just need someone to listen, birth, or death (sadly death even happens on the floor I work on).<br>  You have to be tough, and you have to be able to adapt.  Just pay attention in school, put it into practice, and it will stick (I remember a lot of things now that I never thought I was going to understand in nursing school).<br>  The hours can be tough, and sometimes a shift will be tough, and your family might have to be understanding of your anxiety/emotions.<br>  You will always find a friend at work as long as you are a friend to someone, so you will always have someone to talk to after a bad day if you need it.
RNqRnG86aa	Depending on the plan, Emergency Medical Evacuation insurance covers the cost of transporting a seriously injured or ill person to one of the following locations:<br>  <br>  The nearest adequate medical facility <br>  A hospital near home <br>  Or the hospital of his/her choice <br>  <br>  Emergency Medical Evacuation insurance is usually included with both Travel Medical insurance plans and Trip Protection plans. However, unlike baggage insurance and trip cancellation insurance, it is also sold separately. Sufficient Emergency Medical Evacuation coverage is recommended, especially for long-distance trips abroad. <br>  <br>  Being transported to the nearest medical facility would be covered as an ambulance service. If the injury or illness is too severe to be treated adequately by that medical facility the emergency evacuation benefit will pay to transport your parents to another hospital.<br>  <br>  Read the policy carefully because there is no standard wording. Each policy will define the means, definition and extent of coverage for emergency evacuation.
71KE9umzaa	Medical Technologist!!!!  You get to work in the lab and run cool tests! Anything the doctors need help with diagnosing patients comes from lab results! Depending on where you work, hospital or a reference lab - you're sure be interested in this field for a long time. Some of the things I do is a complete blood count (CBC) - it tells you your white count, your hemoglobin, if you're anemic all sorts of cool stuff. I also work up cultures - which is always fun! Staphylococcus aureus is in everything! The salary is pretty good most start out at $40K. The job outlook is good because there is a national shortage (not a whole lot of people have an appreciation for lab work, including nurses and doctors).  And if you don't like patient contact, you're pretty limited unless you work in a small hospital and have to go on phlebotomy rounds, but that's no so bad...I kinda like sticking people just to say, hey!  I stuck your vein!|`|wvDh3PdFaa	I am a nurse by profession and i deal with these professionals I noticed that both professions are exciting and salary wise ,interesting in such a way that they are exploring their technical know how ,they meet different people with different cases.
NcFWcO3Laa	There is no way you are going to get a loan on an investment property with only 5% down unless you are going to lie on your loan application and say that your are going to live in the property. <br>  <br>   I know a guy that is sitting in federal prison (Kevin A) today because he thought he'd be able to  lie and say his rental property was owner occupied.
Pjm9pg7iaa	You pay $350 and go to a licensing school. Then you take the state test. When you pass you interview at several realty offices. Choose one and start taking buyers out to look at houses to buy or rent..
wSlerVuQaa	This Really Depends on your state. Where I live(Washington state) My spouse can state that her income is whatever I make because we're married. So I make 125k a year, she does my laundry and picks up my coffee cups and gets to claim my 125k as income. (this is not supposed to sound cynical btw, lol) Most applications say.. yada yada state your income and income from all sources. All sources includes your wife's income. Therefore DONT have her cosign unless its going to be over 6 months before you apply for a mortgage.  On average an inquiry will drop your score 10 points. If you have to shop for a car loan do it all within 10 days, it will count as one inquiry.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	As a general rule it is not a good idea to buy a car and house at the same time. In your case the balance on the car loan will be so low that your payments you may be able to carry it with no significant impact on your debt to income ratio. It may affect your credit score, depending on how much credit you already have, payment history, etc. The credit bureau does not care what your debt to income ratio is and do not consider that in calculating   your credit score. Yes the inquiry will show on your credit report, but if you are shopping around for the best rates on a car loan or a mortgage they have little or no effect on your credit score. It is not possible to get an auto loan using her credit and having you as responsible for the payment. Go  to a mortgage lender and have a prequalification done. You may be able to get an approval if they consider her high score offsets your low score..depending on how low it is. That will give you a good indication on whether your mortgage loan is approvable and if not what you need to do to correct it.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Both scores will go down, but the LOWEST will be used to issue credit.  You being on the mortgage will only hurt her ability to get a loan so put it in her name, BUT make sure that you are on the title and deed.|`|5Af6j1qsaa	When someone co-signs, they are basically telling the lender, "Hey, look at my credit.  I'm responsible!  If my co-borrower doesn't pay, I will guarantee payment by taking over payments!"  The lender will do a hard inquiry on the co-signer, which will ding her credit score a tiny bit.  If the loan is granted, the auto loan debt will appear on her credit report as well as yours.  Thus, if you are getting a house afterward, they'll see that she has a new auto loan for $20-$30k.  The new loan will ding her again, and it will also affect her debt:total credit ratio.<br>  <br>  It will also work the other way too.  If she buys the house first, it will ding her credit score and change the way how the auto loan lender may see her.  Lenders don't usually like to see people who have recently obtained loans.  Those people may be living outside of their means.<br>  <br>  You will not be able to get an auto loan with her income under your name.  You would have to apply for the auto loan yourself, get accepted, and then have her make the payments.  No lender in their right mind would loan you money since you're unemployed.  They will want her to either be the main borrower or a co-signer.  After all, if you stop paying, they won't be able to go after you (sure they could sue, but you don't have anything to give them).<br>  <br>  Have her get the house first, and then try to get the car afterwards.  Or buy a cheaper car which would require less financing.|`|ZlznZXqnaa	It can really save you hassle to just get an auto loan estimate online to see what the going rates are.

Meaning, she has too many open accounts that owe money.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Both the credit inquiry and the loan will negatively impact her credit.  Whether it will affect her ability to purchase a house is unknown.
vBIwaQ0qaa	I don't think your roommate will have a leg to stand on in this situation. If your boyfriend is just visiting for a short time. There isn't anything that your roommate or landlord can do to you or your boyfriend. No one can get in trouble for visiting. What's wrong with your roommate? Sounds a little jealous to me.|`|DuGAysygaa	If i were you, i'd move out, you shouldn't have to go through all this crap.|`|3RGqsE7Qaa	Just don't let him stay over for more then 14 days in the month.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you also talk to the leasing office about the possibility of trading/moving your lease to another apartment/roommate.  Many apartments have room based leases and will work with you if your roommate becomes an issue.  Others will allow you to transfer your signature to a lease on a different apartment number.<br>  <br>  Have you considered the possibility of putting your boyfriend on the lease.  At that point you would have to re-evaluate your relationship with your boyfriend.|`|GucrpVR5aa	Well that's really stupid..

It's really something the Leasing Office would need to address.  Did she give you any idea what type of "legal paperwork" they would be giving you?  Maybe you should just stop by the Leasing Office and ask them directly about the situation of having your boyfriend stay over.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, as long as your roommate isn't dangerous to you, I'd encourage you to stay until the end of your lease.  (If it was a standard 1 year lease, you're already three fourths of the way through!)  The reason I'd suggest staying is because it will probably make you a better person.  Sticking with a difficult situation and keeping your commitments are good character traits to cultivate.  They'll help you in the business world, too.  You're probably not going to be able to walk away from every job that has unpleasant co-workers or an unreasonable boss.  So practiceing on how to get along with those types of people now will pay off in the long run.|`|3lYYQWJtaa	In the county I live in, someone is said to be living somewhere if they eat an average of one meal a day there, or stay an average of four nights a week.  Short of that, he's an invited guest, so they can't arrest him for trespassing, and as long as he doesn't meet the guidelines for occupancy, you aren't in violation of your lease.  If your lease is more strict, and it looks like it is, then just confine to every other night, or something like that.  They could hassle you about it all, drag it out and make a big deal about it, but there's really no penalty they can serve you with you can't contest and likely win.

This deduction is usually labeled "FICA," for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, which authorizes the payroll tax. A person's employer is also required to contribute 7.65 percent of the employee's gross salary to Social Security. Self-employed workers are responsible for paying the entire amount themselves. If a person is self-employed, he or she pays 15.3 percent of his or her taxable income to Social Security, but half of that is deductible from federal income tax as a business expense.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	4015 * .9235 * .153 = $567.<br>  <br>  By the way, he's either a lousy employer (doing the wrong form) or he's your client.

The answer is not A, because should you cancel the policy before the six months is over, you've recorded too much insurance expense ahead of time.

You know your mother isn't good for it or she would have credit in her name.|`|z88IMXNFaa	This is going to be unpleasant.  Call the credit card companies and TELL THEM.  They will probably tell you to file a police report.  Do it.  Yes, this is going to get your mother in trouble.  However, what she's doing is illegal and if she gets away with this, who knows what she'll do.<br>  <br>  You have to nip this in the bud immediately.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	The first thing you need is a consult with an attorney to see what your options are, as far as getting this fraudulent information off your credit report nd if you have to report this to the police. Be sure you make the attorney aware that your mother has confessed. You should do what ever you have to do to save your credit. Even if she paid off the credit cards, the  delinquencies will still appear on your credit report for seven years and you will be held  responsible for paying them. It is especially difficult to prove you did not open these accounts if your mother had  the same address you did  when the accounts were opened. Let the chips fail where they may, your mother did did this with full knowledge of what she was doing.  She commited fraud and there is no reason you should pay the consequences for her. Check your credit report very carefully to sse if she opened any other cards. It wouldn't hurt for your mother to write a letter explaining what she did and have it notarized.|`|QAsWwWvFaa	Id call in and say that someone opened them in your name but you dont know who did it. I dont know if id rat out my mom, or press charges against her, even though thats pretty low for her to do that. 90% of the time though, a credit card company never finds out who was using the credit cards cause it costs more money then its worth to them. Try just saying you dont know who did it, its their job to find the people that stole your credit cards, not yours. Even then though your credits going to be screwed up for awhile.

2NhvZ6HRaa	I am assuming the $110,000 was for legal expenses and Research.  Why don't you write it off in the year as Legal & Accounting Charges during the years or years the actual expense incurred. <br>  <br>  Look like you were already writing down the patent in the past, why add this expense to the patent?  The market value of the patent remains the same as before, your legal expenses added to your expenses, not the patent.
EXJfoGtAaa	Lenders don't sell their foreclosures (called REO's) directly, they list them with Realtors.  Retain a Realtor that represents buyers.  It won't cost you anythng because the seller pays the commission through the listing agent.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor
c7Gv3N3Raa	YES!<br>  Always get an inspection..no matter how much the winning bid was..whether it was $40,000 or $140,000.<br>  <br>  Your contract should say the house will close pending an inspection..meaning if you find termites, rot, leaks, foundation cracks, etc...you can back out of the contract without any penalty.<br>  <br>  A home inspection is well worth the $300-$400 dollars if there is a huge major problem you didn't know to look for.

d3WiJVk6aa	I don't think it would be unreasonable to look for other work within your industry, but it may be unethical to seek out a company to hire you based on specific knowledge on your current employer's operations.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what the legality of your situation would be if you did not sign anything that specifically forbade you from sharing sensitive information.  Of course, if your company were to find out you did share sensitive information with the intent to sabotage them, they could still take you to court.<br>  <br>  As a side note, I would be very wary of any company that *would* hire you knowing that you wanted to share sensitive information about your current company.  If a company is willing to act unethically in one regard, they may be unethical in other ways, too.  It's not fun to work for someone who screws people over on a regular basis, eventually you find yourself next in line to be screwed.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	you should work for whoever makes you the best off. you should not divulge sensitive info. You should not use this info to obtain a job with your competitor.|`|wDOjkaYUaa	I think that would be wrong. You should help the other company earn their clients the right way. There is no competition if you cheat.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	As a temp, it's unlikely they have given you information that could seriously damage them. The pricing information seems ok. Supplying customer contact information is not an ethical trespass against the company, however it may be against those customers, especially if that information is about individuals. They trusted your company to keep their privacy intact. You are justified against the company but not against them. Keep in mind that they may retaliate if you ever try to get a job there again.|`|TJAdzZOEaa	Advertising yourself as essentially a corporate spy won't make you look very good to your potential employer.  They'll likely be afraid of you doing the same thing to them.  Play up the skills you've taken from them rather than the customer information.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	Providing sensitive company information is still a no-no, even if you didn't sign a no-compete agreement. <br>  <br>  It's very risky to go to the competition and offer up this info. The competition is never going to think of you as being a trustworthy person afterwards. Even if they hire you to get the info, they might let you go quickly, or keep from promoting you because of that tarnish. <br>  <br>  And how do you know that the person you approach at the other company isn't golfing buddies with your current boss? You could end up unemployed.<br>  <br>  In my industry, everyone knows everyone else, and if I ever did what you are proposing, it would follow me for a very long time.<br>  <br>  You would do better to have a sit down with your boss, and bring up the long overdue subject of why you are still listed as a temp, when you weren't hired that way.

Unfortunately webnode.com does not offer a contact form according to their forum questions & answers. The answer to your question depends on your budget and how professional a website you want and how many features. If you want something really professional, try Mysitemyway.com. You go through their shopping cart, answer questions about your business, and then you have a 5 page site instantly available with your answers forming your initial web content. You can then edit your text and add things to, such as e-commerce, animated banners, Google maps, contact forms, testimonial pages, galleries, FAQ pages, basically every feature you could want. You can try them out for free for 30 days and see what you think. If you would like to see a couple of sites I helped people build using mysitemyway.com, go to canyonqualitytreeservice.com or mcinonline.net. They often offer promotions, so if a 20% discount would make a difference, use their contact form to see if they are offering one now. And they also let you use their system to design websites for other people if that would appeal to you.|`|HRZnFFzSaa	One of the easiest ways to make money online is affiliate marketing <br>  <br>  selling other peoples products...The Wealthy Affiliate University <br>  <br>  teaches and provides you with everything you will ever need to <br>  <br>  affiliate market. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cuw9an" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cuw9an</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Surveys are also a good place to start.

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Foreclosures are generally non-negotiable. Obviously the bank is not willing to negotiate at all with you. Look for a different property.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Despite the other answers here, foreclosures often are negotiable.<br>  <br>  However, in your particular case it appears the bank isn't yet interested in negotiating. Nothing you can do about that...yet. And, yes, while it's not "typical," it's not unusual either.<br>  <br>  First, determine how much the house really, truly is worth. Have a Realtor do a CMA for you. That'll set your ceiling price--the most you should pay. Maybe it's worth even less than $120,000. Or, if it's worth, say, $145,000, then (if you could afford it) it might make sense to raise your offer.<br>  <br>  Next, many banks will reduce the prices of their REOs on a set schedule. So, if the house hasn't sold at $139,000, maybe every 60 days they'll drop the price by $5,000 until it sells. If you wait long enough and it doesn't sell to someone else, it's likely the price will come down.<br>  <br>  Next, if you make another offer, provide justification for your offer. Include photos showing the condition of the house. Better, show the condition of the whole neighborhood. Sometimes it's possible to persuade banks that the BPO (the price estimate) they've received that guided them in setting the list price was inaccurate.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're working with a Realtor who knows and understands foreclosures.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	I'd move on... <br>  My boyfriend put a bid on a house a few days ago and the rude bank just said no...not even a counter offer--that is something i've never heard of..<br>  <br>  I would counter their counter offer with 126,000-128,000 if the house is really what you want..but with the economy the way it is, you should def. no be paying more than what the house is worth unless it's your dream home or something.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	The bank has sent you a clear message.

Likewise, any loan facility has built-in terms and conditions.
