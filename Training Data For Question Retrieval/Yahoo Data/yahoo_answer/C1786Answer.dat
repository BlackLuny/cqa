mkMJYIJOaa	Thanks for all the Campaign Donations, My Friends and comrades!  Forever yours,, Hussein obama.|`|JthubNIsaa	He'll slobber all over himself. He's an appeaser. He should Michelle write it.|`|PkBMMvqTaa	Irans president says the US owes them an apology.....FOR WHAT?  I would not talk to this crazy person.|`|mc9M9kvsaa	Hello this is Token|`|PG2gd1tOaa	This is a tough call, how does Obama approach the Iranians without looking weak or submissive...if Obama leaves the slightest hint he is only communicating with the Iranians to make himself look good at home and to fulfill a campaign promise the Iranians will probably use it to their advantage. I guess he could approach them with the ol' "walk softly and carry a nuke" attitude. I think the majority of those living a normal day to day life in Iran don't hold ill feeling towards us but like us their government drags them along doing goofy things in their name.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Just our back boneless president caving when Iranian chief gets all caulky and bossy!

Keep Up That Good Work "|`|hlpdeiFuaa	If I were Obama, i wouldn't write any letter for now...the interview he made live on Al-Arabiya is enough already to pass a certain message of appeasement...    And it's not fair to say "shouldn't be writing to them..." but more "shouldn't be writing to HIM". Yes the current President. Knowing that his completely extremist and worse than a dictator. With these people, you can't talk without pronoucing God. Without saying a word not related to their Islamic vision of the world...Iranian election's should take place on the 20th June...and for sure...Ahmadinejad won't get re-elected...|`|WdvSuJP9aa	Dear president Ahmadinejad,         STOP seeking nuclear capabilities immediately!   We have consistently been very patient with you.  The United States along with the international community have warned you several times...but you choose to ignore us all, WHY?    You have said in no uncertain terms that your goal is to "wipe Israel off the map" and your country has historically been an ally & sanctuary for terrorists and Jihadists worldwide( all while we are currently at WAR with terrorism)... you have interfered with our war in Iraq and literally supplied our current enemies with ammunitions to kill & destroy our troops .    In my new administration you are now given a "second chance" to alter your course and help me to establish world peace...I am being more than gracious...if you squander this opportunity at REAL PEACE & CHANGE ....I will determine that you are hell-bent on DEATH & WAR and must consider you a clear and present danger and  ENEMY of the United States and Israel....And we will IMMEDIATELY DECLARE FULL WAR UPON YOU AND YOUR COUNTRY!    The choice is yours...You have approximately 1 week to respond and comply!                                       Yours Truly,                                              President Barrack HUSSEIN Obama                                                                     Peace out|`|TGRKbQMVaa	I hope he would say something like, bomb Isreal and we will kick your sorry ***.
WC55CP9qaa	These events were not gains for sure, since they caused a lot of distress for those who invested in them. In the case of Enron it would seem nothing was really learned by the authorities concerned. Apart from a few trials nothing more was said. And yet the current crisis exists because they did not think others would copy some of Enron's questionable accounting methods.  It is almost painfully obvious what should be done. I leave it to you to work it out. Just remember one thing - you cannot spend what you never earned. Simple.|`|wxMhNtXUaa	try to check on this site http://en.wikipedia.org/ there you find about india..|`|oEUQiAV1aa	Sorry to say. But the truth is Indians should not trust each other because there are no Citizens in India. There are only People living in India.    Here it is why.    DESPERATION  85% of Indians are languishing in an informal economy to earn $2 a day so that they can feed a meal for their family.   Hence their lives oscillate between DESPERATION and FRUSTATION.  As of today, Voting in Elections for 100 rupees is the only respite for them.    COLLUSION  Only 15% of one billion Indians are earning more than $2 a day.  They prefer to evade Taxes.  And as we know Taxes lead to Civilization.  One Indian does not want fellow Indian to succeed.  Bribe or Caste is the only relation between any two individuals in India (politicians, businesses,govt officials,judiciary).  Source of revenue for govt is corporate taxes.  And source of funds for political parties is corporate bribes.

WC55CP9qaa	Neither actually own the land, because land belongs to all the people on the planet. It is a conceit of modern governments that they own land. They are merely custodians of land and should be ready to give a full accounting of what they have done to improve it.  Ownership is a myth that keeps evil in power.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Palestine are fighting from tyranny, just put it that way...|`|HJaVcUGwaa	Lets look at the facts:  ? Before 1917 Jews made up 8% of the population  ? Britain decided to give what is not theirs to others  ? Jews became 33% and owned 7% of the land by 1947, but the UN allocated to them 55%  ? Israel was allocated 55% of the land, but they occupied 80%  ? Zionists ethnically cleansed 80% of the native population on that land  ? In 1967 Israel occupied the remaining 20%  ? Israel built and is still building illegal settlements, against UN resolutions  ? Israel did not return land occupied, against UN resolutions  ? Israel did not allow refugees to return, against UN resolutions  ? Israel built an apartheid wall around native towns against World Court orders  ? Israel blockaded and starved then attacked and destroyed civilian areas in violation of international law (Gaza)    From the above facts, it seems the Zionists owned 7% of Palestine before 1947, and then stole the rest from the Palestinians against UN resolutions and international law.  So the way I see it, the Palestinians own the land.|`|VHNyiARCaa	Palestine is the land of the Palestinians and David Ben Gurion (the first Israeli Prime Minister) admitted it, as quoted by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Jewish Paradox), p.121:    "If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti - Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?"|`|hlpdeiFuaa	At the very first place...Israel didn't exist...but Palestine did...so all of Israel was Palestine...Jesuralem was Palestine, Tel Aviv was Palestine...When the Israel State has existed...it all started to crumble...and get worse...But that is past and present...meaning it will never finish...The problem now is HAMAS.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	Israel is a terror apartheid state bombed into existence, i prefer to call it occupied Palestine .

Ask either the Arabs or the Israelis and both will say Me Me Me. That is the problem.|`|QDmmwDnKaa	Where the Israelis been before 1948? They were just citizens in Europe , Russia, and US. They ,supported by the English colonizing state, occupied the Arab lands. Year after year they managed to penetrate and dominate the American military and political administrations to get more and  more of land. Now after a long history of weakness , the Palestinians are resisting the occupying forces ,which have the most sophisticated and destructive weapons from America,and yet they call it terror.|`|WvfTOjRFaa	The Palestinians owns the the land. But the Israelites, claims that God, gave that land to them.The problem here their  beliefs are not the same.So, one day, only the true God, can solve this conflict.|`|6rcRZUnSaa	Palestine  is  the  name  that  was  given  by  Rome. Rome  wanted  that  people  around  the  world  forget  that  Israel  exist, they  wanted  that  nobody  can't  remember  that  Jews  live  in    Jerusalem  and  other  lands  of  Israel. That's  why  Rome  changed  name  of  Israel  to  Palestine. After  that, Palestine  was  land  of  Roman, Crusades, Turkey, UK, Jordan. Palestine  like  independent  country  didn't  exist. Palestine  didn't  have  own  money, laws, currency  and  other  things  that  have  all  Independence  countries. Palestine  always  been  occupied  by  not  Israel,  the  countries  from  my  list. If  you  ask,  who  of  them  own  the  land.   My  answer  is  Israel.If  you  don't  agree  with  me , please  don't  forget  that  other  countries  like  Turkey  or  UK  also  have  right  on  this  land, but  not  Palestine.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	I guess whoever has the current title.

0fQk2spXaa	Once a product is legal and you try to make it illegal, it doesn't work.  This is why prohibition failed.  Weed has always been illegal.  If we made it legal and it led to bad results, we could not go back and make it illegal again.  We could, but it would not work.  Your argument about alcohol is actually a good reason to keep weed illegal.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	your right people who have drink problems destroy their own health and ruin the life of those around them, they cram up the a&e and take up to much police time|`|HUlyRTrraa	Partially correct.

They banned alcohol, but it made the problem worse and the crime figures rose. Banning things is not the way to deal with alcohol.  Why ban alcohol.

os1ws4wIaa	SCIENCE: A BOON OR A BANE?    Humans incessantly explore experiment, create, and examine the world. This urge to know more and explore the unexplored has given birth to the field called science. The active process by which physical, biological, and chemical occurrences are studied is known as science .The origin of science has been lost in the mists of time.  Science- this single word itself has a lot to say. Science has truly been the burning topic of the century. Today, you just need to think about any sector and the word science will surely come up. Science technology has made an immense impact on nearly every sphere of daily life. Science plays a major role in todays society.  Science is like a knife. A knife can be used to cut vegetables. The same knife can also be used as a lethal weapon .In the same way science can be used as a tool for the development but like every coin has another side, science, when it is in wrong hands can be abused. The exploitation of science can result in several disastrous consequences like nuclear wars, catastrophic pollution and ruinous bloodshed.  It is only due to science that we stand where we are today. Science has given us lot-computers, technology, electronics, gadgets and the list goes on and on. Science has beyond doubt been a boon for us.  Science has made life easier for man. Thanks to science we can travel from one corner of the world to another within seconds. Transportation has become a million times easier due to science and technology.   Through telecommunication and technology science has brought the world closer. Today a man in India can communicate through the internet to a person in another nook of the world. Science has truly made us say that this is a small, small world.Infact; the world has become so small for us that we have started exploring the space and are even thinking of settlements on Mars.   Science has done a great service to mankind by giving birth to medical technology. Today, science has greatly augmented the longevity of life. Once incurable diseases like small-pox have completely been eradicated and dreaded maladies like Cancer are no longer without a remedy.  Through the advent of hybrids farmers have received a boon. Today farming is a lot easier than it was a decade ago. After the green revolution farming has become a lot easier and the yield has increased tenfold.  Like every coin have two faces. The same science which has been of such great assistance to mankind has another face. Science which has bestowed us with development, progress, expansion and growth has also brandished us with hostilities, destruction, violence, ruin, devastation, annihilation bloodshed, carnage and obliteration.  Gone are the days when peace and tranquility used to prevail throughout the world. Today a gun booms in one corner of the world or another everyday. Wars are fought between countries for years and years together at a stretch. Families are torn apart and friends are lost forever, never to be reunited .By giving birth to weaponry, warcraft and armaments it can be indisputably said that science is the root of battles, armed conflicts and international disputes. Thanks to science we are plunging headlong into an era of nuclear wars.  Due to the advent of science the longevity of life has greatly increased. But, this is paving the way for over-population and population explosion. This has resulted in mass deficiency of land.Today, due to this we are even auctioning of land on the moon!  Thus, I have illustrated some of sciences advantages and disadvantages. But can we really blame science when it comes to the disadvantages? I believe that the culpability lies with those who misuse science. The radar of blameworthiness, in my opinion, should never fall on science. Hence I can state indubitably that science is a great boon for humankind, but when it is misused it can prove to be the most worst of banes.|`|EuGBt9pfaa	Science has changed the face of the world. It has, of course, given many things that benefit man. But the evils that it has showered on man wash away the advantages. It has made man depend on machines, calculators and computers. A day may come when his physical and mental faculties may grow so weak that he may not be able to lift a bag or solve a simple equation. In the field of health services, it has given us life-saving drugs. But it has also given drugs like smack and heroin. Nuclear energy created by science has been much praised but the blast in Russia has exploded the myth. Atom bombs created by scientists were thrown on Hiroshima and Nagasaki decades ago. The painful memory still lingers and millions of people are still ill.   The greatest harm science has done is to the faith of man. God has become a nonentity. In the modern jungle of mental activities where would a desperate man go? Having lost faith, his intellectual activities lead him to suicide. A number of scientists meet this fate every year in India|`|NJbLm7Pyaa	you open the website www.google.com.

Thats the law over here and i see the reasons why.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	Children grew up in the British Isles for centuries drinking a week beer as their main beverage, nothing wrong with that. Associating alcohol with the need to get drunk is the problem. Education not prohibition.|`|sJQ6gG0Uaa	nope, it will just make children more adamant to try it...    RE: "smck2009"....im 15 my parents let me drink at home, a few cans or a half a pint at a restraunt, its not just chavs that drink.    why does everyone think that EVERYONEdrinks and gets totally smashed and binges everyweekend?|`|V4oULksLaa	NO Absolutely not!  I may be 9 but i love beer!  Even though i only get 3 sips a year!|`|lFPsPzxzaa	yes because it could be very harmful|`|xDDutHCnaa	I think that they're going to drink anyway, might as well expose them to it at a younger age so that they know the dangers and also the fun of it. I've been drinking since I was maybe 13 years old, but I've turned out okay, it's because at a young age I knew what I could handle and how I reacted to the alcohol.|`|H5RF5w4daa	true lloyd above and if there put off it they maybe not want it for a long time lol|`|IupDRUKnaa	I agree, but i also Disagree.  It is just a feeling, and it some cases is very fun.  Aslong as they are within the safety of parents.    I also think it is wrong. Children who are influenced at a young age, it has effects. Children are Children, Adults are adults.  =]|`|tqyqMvJIaa	it depends on the situation. if there at a party or with friends at a friends house no they shouldnt! but if there home or somewhere around there parents and they are not leaving then yea. but at least 14 years old! like 12 13 no thats stupid but 14 15 a little more responsible.|`|xHlcnkgWaa	Well i think a sip with a meal here and there isn't a problem, if you tell them know, they'll want it even more.

It's completely absurd to give alcohol to anyone who isn't fully developed. It can damage their growth. And the younger they are the worse it is for them. Giving a 5 year old alcohol is just opening up a door for developmental disabilities that can be prevented.|`|sbmzMVLraa	No because it is ok if they are with there parents and drink a little bit as in The Netherlands children are aloud drinking alcohol and it is not as bad as the UK - e.g. teenagers getting pis*ed.|`|SgFvuqJmaa	I don't agree,  My parents gave me a small glass of wine on special occasions since I was about twelve years old.  I'm now 21 and perfectly healthy.    A very small amount infrequently will not harm a child and they won't be as curious about it after they've tried it.  Surely it's better for a child to have a "honest" glass of alcohol in the house with their parents than tanking themselves up on vodka or "buckfast" out of the street, unsupervised?  i would argue that the teenage street binge drinkers are more likely to get alcohol problems.|`|e122182d5312f82d9ebcfaaa39384d0caa	yes|`|sDCgltcoaa	under  21|`|VRZ3tcEBaa	i started drinkin at 14 so if there gonin to do it they will wether the parents know or not|`|3e78c077e47775760680db0d60e6d067aa	no child should be giving alcohol ,but it so easy to get hold of with the supermarkets selling it so cheap we need to have a cap on how much   they can lower down the prices and have stronger laws to stop them   selling to children ,also have them be-made aware of the dangers  and damage alcohol can do to them and there  family we should have a campaign like the no for smoking .stop drinking and show young children and how it can ruin everyone life's|`|5HeNp5tjaa	i agree but i think the drinkin age should be lowered to 18 years of age instead of 21|`|04dd91a481260888cf4efe0e2fafa0d9aa	In America the legal drinking age is 21 because up until that point your brain is still developing and growing new brain cells.  If you start drinking before that point you could actually incur some brain damage or have underdeveloped brain cells.|`|4vDVvCK2aa	yes and no? its debatable in my head.|`|x8B4527Jaa	I think that kids binge drink because they have never had alcohol before and as soon as they get access to it, they drink a lot.  I have been brought up around alcohol and my parents always taught me about the dangers of it, but also that you can enjoy it responsibly..  If someone was never allowed to taste alcohol as a kid/teen and then they go to a party or wherever and are given alcohol, then they are going to get drunk and think they are 'it'.|`|kNLz1SE9aa	yup obiously childrens under 15 shd not use alcohol.......Actually to speak after all diseases n stuffs even plp above 15 shd not consume alcohol.|`|26t0dbQ5aa	no. some whisky on the tite works wonders.|`|avhgLEu8aa	No, I don't think so.

Whenever these stories come up all the middle class parents bang on about wine with meals blah blah blah.

Never mind all the hype that it'll stop binge drinking and encourage responsible drinking. It's irresponsible to give a child alcohol.  Perhaps we should give them drugs too to discourage substance abuse.|`|s30Duwdraa	Depends on the situation.  I am Italian and I grew up on having wine with Sunday pasta dinners.  Not by the bottle or anything, just a few glasses here and there (mixed with ginger ale).  I don't see a problem, as long as it's minimal and adults are present.    If you hide it or lock it up, it only gives teens the fuel they need to try and get it.  They are going to, one way or the other... you're better off letting them drink at home once and a while, where you know it's safe and they aren't getting in a car with someone who's intoxicated.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	no i drunk before i was 15. im not an alcoholic and i never caused trouble

However, I've known many Jewish people who will stand up and say 'I'm a Jew' and 'Who is a Jew' is a basic question about Jewish identity.    Meanhwile, I've never actually seen any of these supposedly repeated attempts to 'expunge' the word as offensive and suspect this is another of your anti-Jewish (sic) sh!t stirrings.

These self-obsessed women seemed genuinely unaware that 9/11 was an attack on our nation and acted as if the terrorist attacks happened only to them. ... I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much ... the Democrat ratpack gals endorsed John Kerry for president ... cutting campaign commercials... how do we know their husbands weren't planning to divorce these harpies? Now that their shelf life is dwindling, they'd better hurry up and appear in Playboy.[87]|`|mc9M9kvsaa	Don't liberals like free speech for everybody. I guess you like free speech as long as she keeps her mouth shut.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Yes, she knows, but she doesn't care who she offends.  I used to be totally disgusted with her evil words, but now I just find it amusing.  I can't imagine that she has any true friends.........she must be very lonely and unhappy in spite of all the attention.|`|lK3ooHWQaa	She's intelligent, witty, and has an ability to attract attention and make people listen to her, and talk about her. As long as she is able to make money doing that, I'm sure she will continue. She makes me angry sometimes, and then I stop and realize that is what she wanted, to shock people into thinking. I don't really like her views, but I acknowledge that she is a powerful woman.     I also don't like that she seems to purposefully provoke people into attacking her gender so that she can gloat when they do exactly that. It goes both ways though. They don't have to fall for her bait. Some of her critics have said and done worse things where she is concerned. Yes, she knows she's saying those things out loud.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	She is indeed a madwoman.  I'd heard of her, but didn't know what she stood for.

I saw an interview with her recently where she said that single mothers were the root of crime. She said that 80% of people incarcerated were from single mothers. It is unfortunate to me that she doesn't understand how reproduction works because she fails to state an obvious factor that maybe because the fathers are not in the picture could have something to do with it.    And she says ignorant sweeping statements like that all of the time. All. Of. The. Time.    I think somewhere inside her she's just wanting attention. It boggles my mind that someone could be that far away from reality.|`|704e5d296085ea43392282942c0cf641aa	Ann Coulter is suffering from some kind of mad, mental disconnect because she's a terribly unattractive woman.

No one could possibly get as far as she has by using her mouth -- unless you count a bag of bones as the reason, but today's American men seem to like voluptuous curvy blonds, not pick-up-sticks ones.  Would you seriously like to see her in a Victoria Secrets bra?    Anyway.........    So its a given, she's intelligent who's made a living talking to the unintelligent who can not think critically for themselves.  Which brings up the reason why? I mean, she can not seriously believe half the crap she peddles------can she?    Could it be...........she's in it for the money, like any good snake oil salesman.    Makes sense to me.

Spacephantom has a point though, freedom of speech and all that... the thing with freedom of speech is, people can say what they want and you don't necessarily have to listen.
1b611f18c550f86e4004e2a498a5d55aaa	Like many here, I too, find making a doll that supposed to represent Caylee and calling it a tribute a repulsive, though I would like to know if the Anthony family agreed with the making of the doll as a tribute. Even if the family did, I still would not buy such a toy because I feel it trivializes Caylee and her death. I'm afraid a sex predator would buy the doll and use it for perverted purposes. I am like the one respondent--have a Caylee Anthony BEAR--not a DOLL--the doll's too personal. And use the profits to support a charity or an organization that fights against child abuse and not just profit from Caylee's death.  I do wonder if the family has or had said anything about this.|`|ZZ4Nh7yJaa	Sadly, some people are just out there for the dime.  The CEO for the company said, they had no charity that wanted the money from them if it was from the sale of this doll.  They also, had no idea as to the cost, the copy rights, or the production.  I think it is a matter of "Bad advertisement is better than none".  I have been chatting with others on line, and we have come up with a two prong idea.  Not only will we not purchase the doll, but we will stay out of the stores carrying any future doll.  If enough people do it for just a certain date or time period, then they will not have any one to retail the product to.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I think it is distasteful to try and make money off of a girl that so tragically died.  What a horrendous death that little angel had to suffer.  It is just sick!!!|`|Do6NfeACaa	Yes I think the owner of the company is a sick, twisted, creep. He was on HLN trying to defend himself saying that nobody objected to the Michael Vick chew toys or the Sarah Palin sunglasses. Hmmmm let's see adults who chose to be in the public eye and an innocent 2 year old baby that was murdered....NOT THE SAME IDIOT!!!    He also stated that he was a father (poor kids), I wonder how he would feel if someone murdered his child and then tried to make a buck off of their death. What a loser!|`|b3dKghjHaa	They've decided against doing that because of public outrage. And yes, I thought it was horrible for them to try to cash in on something as terrible as this.|`|ymdPniDYaa	Most things on Nancy Grace are disturbing, especially the host.      The toy company must be run by a bunch of desperate idiots if they're going to capitalize on an innocent girl's murder.  If I find out which company it is, I will boycott them.|`|XGHLrOklaa	I think it's absolutely disgusting when people try and profit from tragedy.  Just like they did after 911 selling bumper sticker and flags etc.  Not only is this guy trying to sell dolls,which allegedly you can't buy the doll anymore, he's also selling t-shirts and braclets on his web-site.  sick b@stard.|`|AA10093245	Those people are opportunists, trying to profit for themselves with little regard to right and wrong. I think it's an outrage, and if any were sold, I sure hope all proceeds go to prevention of child abuse. That's one of the saddest stories I have ever heard. I literally had tears come to my eyes when I read that that poor little 2 year old baby's last words were "mommy I love you".|`|MaOcrip1aa	That turns my stomach.  I don't think thats appropriate at all.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	I agree with you. I think it's a sick idea. It's just a way of exploiting her and the publicity that the case has had. They know the case has been all over the news and that people would buy or atleast know about the doll because of that.    People will stop at nothing to make some money. Even when it means stooping down to the very lowest level...|`|H1NjIT10aa	Oh, I think it totally tasteless.  This is just a sick action to try to profit form this poor little girl's death!    Now if the toy company produced say a stuffed Bear and called it the Caylee Bear and donated 100% of the profits to a charity to fight child abuse then yeah, it would be a "tribute" to Caylee.      But this is puree materialism.|`|N1wUHYKlaa	i personally think making a doll to "tribute" a poor girl who has been murdered is awful.    wouldn't a better way to give tribute to something like this be making a non-profit organization that would help prevent the same thing happening in the future?    the doll is/was thought of in poor taste. i woudn't be caught DEAD giving some little girl, or anyone for that matter a doll of an innocent child who was murdered.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Whats worse is that the dolls sings "You are my sunshine" a song that Caylee used to sing. Thankfully many people found it in very very poor taste and its been banned. How people can try to make money on such a heartbreaking case is beyond belief.|`|kpPbnzwXaa	please sign:    http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/no-t...

Oh yeah and also, they are giving people the option to choose from 3 different names now!!

4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	I agree with your comments on London.  I worked there as a project manager for 12 years and now, when I go back, although there are some respectable places, the main is a dreadful place to be.    I live in Somerset, tranquil, beautiful and a friendly place although I have to admit, to get to trendy bars and night life, you have to travel to Bristol. Crime rate is also not as high.    I think it depends what you are looking for in life.  Any large city, wherever it is, is going to attract crime, whether it be from locals or visitors who seem to believe being somewhere else is reason to get paralytic and cause trouble.    I think at times we all want to up sticks and move on, as indeed I did from the Midlands 15 years ago.  I personally have never looked back, although I love Britain and have been more than happy with my choice of move.    Good luck whatever you decide to do.    :)|`|EBqFpZbjaa	I'm a London born here in 1940 - You really don't want to believe your own propaganda mate.  London in 1940 was far more dangerous than it ever is now.  You have no idea.    The Nazi Luftwaffe raid on London 1940 Battle of Britain  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=rcR9NOVIGX...    Ed Morrow in Trafalgar Square 1940 reporting direct to the USA  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VpOKriiNIz...    People have always had knives here in UK - it's nothing new.    You must understand that the newspaper owners are desperate for our attention as we turn away in our million to surf the Internet and almost entirely ignore the rags in favour of something else.    Thus, to capture our attention the newspapers must create headline news, "BOY STABBED" - then you read the story and find out it's some kid in the Bronx NYC.    My advice, pay no attention and go about your life with confidence.    If you had ventured into Covent Garden in the 1750s I doubt you would have gone very far before someone demanded your shoes, then someone would have taken your coat and finally when you were naked, someone would have cut your ears off just for a laff.    Henry Fieldings London "City of Vice"  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_nkifPGJ...    On average there are about 400 murders a year here in UK.  In the USA there are nearly 450 murders a year in New York alone.    Don't make me laff.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	It is time to change the Government when the only people who want to be here are from the third world.|`|B20bhtioaa	Definately!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

France has some pretty ugly and dangerous areas, although I don;t know about other parts of Europe.    If it were me looking to re-locate, I think I'd want to know how other countries tackle crime.  It's so unsafe here in the UK because our so-called judicial system is weak and useless - no deterrent at all.    Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	I wouldn't want to live in London either.  Have a good look around - how many British people are in London?  It has become a melting pot of different races and cultures and it doesn't work.  The last time I went to London we played a game called "listen for the English speaker". There are too many race problems and conflicts.   The same goes for the other UK cities you mention.  Denmark was very clever and restricted who they let into their country so there wasn't much of a problem in the past (and it's much smaller).  With the EU open to all policies this will change and I am certain they already have their share of problems creeping in.   You will get pockets of "no-go" areas in any country so it's best to just avoid them.  I live in a large town in the UK and I am not afraid to go out on an evening.  The media have a lot to answer for as they put the fear into us.  Scarey news sells more papers than good news.  The UK has lost the respect that it once had in the world but if I was to move it would be to Canada, USA or NZ.|`|aVSHsX2Faa	ermm... probably why you never see decent, respectable people out at night - they know it's trouble and they get a taxi to take them where they wanna go or, AT LEAST have 2 back up plans about where they are going and how they are going to get there.|`|DNQxUcptaa	Definitely!  I feel much safer when I am in Germany, the UK is getting worse, the police have lost control and are just 'firefighting' now. I don't seriously consider going to the police for any problems anymore, in fact I feel that if you do go to the police about something then you are more likely to end up being convicted of something else rather than the person(s) you are complaining about even being considered!|`|AA12279950	Yes you should.  Off you go.  We don't need your pessimism - feel free to leave.|`|AA12352139	Britain has got it's problems, but let me remind you of the old adage - the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.    I have always fallen in love with every country I've gone to on holiday and wish I could stay there. However, the fact is that you start experiencing the negative aspects and flaws of that country once you have  to live there permanently - get a job, commute, buy a house etc. I have already done it before. It means starting life all over again - from scratch.     If you are under 25 with no family - give it a go. If not, make the best of your life where you are. Remember, it could be worse (spare a thought for those who have to live in Zimbabwe!)|`|stRWElvPaa	The thing is, that you are experiencing life in the centre of cities. The secret to a quiet and relaxing life, in the UK as well as in most other countries is to live in the suburbs or countryside.    I grew up in a terraced house in the centre of town. I thought it was ok, not great and of course I had to put up with idiots and chavs in the area.     But then my parents moved out into the suburbs, about 8 miles out of the city centre, into a modern village.     You would not realise the difference in quality of life. There are (thank goodness) no chavs, idiots etc. You'll find that they all congregate in the centre of cities and towns.      So before you moce abroad, try finding a nice area out of town to move to.      Mind you saying that, I lived in a big city in a European country for a year, and I have to admit there are less delinquents, even in the city centre.      It's also true that there are more and more delinquents, idiots and riff raff in the UK these days, both indigineous and immigrants.      I don't really know why. I think it has something to do with the huge council estates everywhere.      The UK is going downhill, whether it recovers or whether it sinks further is hard to predict.    Hope this helps.|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	If you have a worthwhile skill - go!

I've lived in East London for 12 yrs and I've never once been caught up in any trouble. As for the Underground, it's less likely to happen there than anywhere else due to the amount of cameras down there. Crime happens everywhere, all the time but mostly only involves criminals. Newspapers have a habit of making single incidents sound like crime waves. Sensationalism sells papers after all.  Scandinavia does seem perfect at a glance but I assure you there is crime and nastiness there as well. (just look at their suicide rates when compared with here)  It doesn't matter where you go, if you believe all of the hype then you will still be frightened.|`|3AZ63fYxaa	This Labour government have ruined this country,and when people are getting killed for just coming back from the shop, or a night out, or for trying to stop their property from being vandalised, then no wonder 8  families a week are going to live overseas..................And the quality of life is rubbish, with poor weather,so you can not go out, and engage in sport, or a day out at the coast.etc..................|`|3e78c077e47775760680db0d60e6d067aa	no i would not let this scumbags stop me going out and i would never leave england because of the crime rate ,we all can do something about it

My65doewaa	This fight is entirely about religion.  Don't be fooled by people telling you it's about land.. but it very clearly isn't.    While the West Bank was held by Jordan and Gaza was held by Egypt the Muslim world simply didn't care.  While Jordan was expelling and killing tens of thousands of Palestinians.. the Muslim world simply didn't care.  Islamic governments and militias around the world kill tens of thousands a year.. and the Muslim world simply doesn't care.    They only care when a non-Islamic group holds territory.    And let's be clear on what Islam demands of it's followers.  It is a religion that demands genocide and jihad as a REQUIREMENT for all Muslims.

Then how could you explain to me that Jews lived peacefully under Islamic rule?? and in times when they were oppressed in Europe:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skbExDtFi...      For Muslims they believe that Islam gives them the right to fight defending their lands and homes:    "Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors.  (The Noble Quran, 2:190)"      For Jews they think that god promised them the land thousands of years ago, and this is what I found in the old testament:     "When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nationsthen you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy."  Deuteronomy 7:1-2,    "do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy themas the Lord your God has commanded you"  Deuteronomy 20:16      The Quran has the verses relating war that forbids attacking woman,children and old people, and to not ruin plants, not to destroy buildings, just to fight with the one's fighting with them, as in the real self-defence, it's nothing compared to this terror and evil book which was changed and modified by the Jews..      Besides, their claim that God gave them the land is illogical because:    1) If God gave the land to the Jews - why did they snub his gift by leaving it??    2) How come they suddenly remembered they lived there 1300 years later?    3) And they say its written in the book that Israel belongs to the the jews - but who actually wrote the book? Wasn't it the Jews?    4) And aren't most of the 'Jews' who went to Israel to live after 1948 actually Europeans?    5) If an Eskimo living in Reykjavik converts to Judaism - does that mean he can move to Israel and force a Palestinian family out of their home?|`|JmdnlQsHaa	if it was about economics they wouldnt have chosen a sh*t-hole with limited water supply|`|01PN5Jpaaa	Religion is the ONLY reason they are at war.

qe0RNp7xaa	This is the first neutral question I've ever seen on YahooAnswers, or hell, on any website... GOOD JOB!!!     Politics has never changed. Remember when you were in elementary school or middle school voting for Class Presidents and the guy/girl who promised 3 recesses a day and chocolate pudding for lunch everyday always won, when in reality the kid who won did the same exact thing the kid the year before did. It's just a popularity contest!|`|qpxPW5paaa	Of course he is, he's a politician. Anybody that expects any real change without revolution is just naive.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	People are ignorant.   Wait until Obama makes his first big mistake.     I can't wait to see the look on the people that voted for him's faces when they say "what happened?"

Why don't you wait and see before you get on here and start talking against President Obama.     Bush had 8 years and God knows we didn't want or need another Bush.

Hopefully, praying, that this President will make a difference like Clinton did, (you have to admit even if you don't like him, he wasn't as bad as Bush!)  Clinton fought for the little people, and kept us at a reasonable peace.  I hope Obama takes this stand, there is just too much total chaos for him to fix anything right away.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	First off, he needed to surround himself with the people who was in charge, hence they had the country for eight years, no one other than them would know everything.

He didn't lie about Change...he even said it may not all be done, during his office..but he will get it going...

bYtCfdwbaa	I think a lot hinges on whether things improve after the trauma and how much help the traumatised child gets and the quality of the help.If the situation remains the same,gets worse or appears hopeless to the child and there seems no way out then there is little chance that they will move on.On the other hand if they have at their disposal good quality professional counselling and a means to escape further trauma then they have a better chance of dealing with it but some may still carry it throughout their lives even with help .|`|RdHeKBUMaa	Some do and the luckier ones can repress them.

Do you think their lives aren't blighted by fear?  The Israelis don't publicise this so much because they are proud, but children have been traumatised both sides of the border.|`|lVzBupUaaa	I think children remember certain things - their mum crying, their grandma being frightened.    I know from my childhood, the really bad things are there, but I most remember the times people I care for have been scared or upset - or when something horrible has been said or done to me.    Obviously these children are suffering - obviously their childhood has been taken away from them by the war - but children are resiliant and most of them will learn to live with the terrible start they have had in life.|`|12Aifvf4aa	It all depends on the individual, the support they get and the trauma.

This all happened "under his watch".  It's a disgrace.    Also, we all know that black people have been financially depressed in this country, and are more likely to have to resort to eating peanut butter than whites.  This president has done nothing to stop the senseless deaths (dare I say "murder") of blacks at the hands of tainted peanut butter.    Because of this, I can only come to one conclusion.  President Obama hates black people.|`|hVXTOL4Daa	Should Day V be incarcerated for asking us stupid questions and whose sole aim is to impeach Obama?|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	Did you mean to put your rant in the comedy section.

Limbaugh and O'Riely are nothing more than lightening poles for the right to play off of to rally the troops around some idea based upon those ultra right beliefs.     The problem is that that they are counter productive to the cooperation needed to overcome our current financial crisis.     When the religious right bought and paid for the Republican party back in the late 80's and early 90's by getting many local elections for the party, they began the slow and methodical process of attempting to instill bible based dogma, doctrine and beliefs into the laws and constitution of our land.     This is in direct violation of the US Constitution. Our Constitution's First Amendment specifically prohibits the involvement of religion in government and government creating a state religion.  This boarders on treason to the language and foundation of our Representative Constitutional Republic.     The continued attacks by the ultra right on our Constitution has been shown by the over 200 Executive Orders written by the Bush administration.

If the parents are in such a volatile situation the children should be placed in a place of safety whilst the problems are resolved.Back to the question of whta should be done with him... my view on murder always has been an eye for an eye....I'd gladly volunteer to throw him off the bridge!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Hang him from the bridge.|`|AA10419781	just like anything else mental problems its sad but he felt if he wasnt part of the equation she wouldn't be either|`|pJqEhEy5aa	It is a shame that we cannot tell what makes people do this... At least if we could we could likely take steps to prevent this.  Unfortunately, any suitable punishment would be considered unjust by much of society as a whole, or perhaps unsuitable for a man going through psychological distress.    I myself believe that even those suffering with mental distress issues need harsh laws and consequences.  Maybe harsh consequences to their actions would deter them from performing stunts that would harm or perhaps kill other human beings.  They need also to be deterred from setting examples of extremely judgment-poor behavior that would serve to show others with similar mental issues to do the same.|`|Is6tvTrfaa	He is definitely mad.|`|AA11076076	Should leave him alone in a room with parents of similar aged children.

However, in retrospect we cannot just blindly believe what the media tells us completely and push all our anger on the alleged. It might be exaggerated/dramatised in a sense or another. Well there are times when we lose ourselves in anger and do outrageous stuffs. One can't rule out the possibility that wrong decisions cannot be made from someone who is fine and kindhearted. I hope he will be sad and regret what he has done and do something to atone for his mistakes - love his family even more and apologise to them even if he is not forgiven.    There are times when we make mistakes and some may be  more serious than the others. We must learn to forgive and make rational judgement to the issue as well as come up with solution to solve the societal issues from its roots. We should not just to remove criminals like they are some rubbish/weeds and pretend by making them disappear or pushing all the blame on them can solve anything in the long run.     The thing I learnt from unjust/atrocious issues such as what you have mentioned above should lead us into thinking that we should put ourselves into others shoes and think and prevent ourselves from making such mistakes due to a moment of folly.     This is our quest.   Grievances compels justice  Mistakes encourages change.    Well I am not suggesting that he should be pardoned. But the fact is, if he is really that heartless, punishing people like him won't solve anything. We should do something for the society to prevent things like that from happening. An example will be a BLOCKBUSTER movie to promote family love. Hahaha...

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) It sounds like this school hasn't entirely thought this through in my opinion, has anyone in the school even considered what kind inappropriate message this gives out i.e. call me prudish but doesn't pole dancing really belong in strip jionts or adult encounter type bars.    **Sorry! I must be becoming a boring old codger but shouldn't pole dancing stay firmly were it came from in night clubs & late night members bars. Its NOT IMO appropriate in schools.

EBqFpZbjaa	People lose money they bury in their gardens all the time.  The most famous lost garden money has got to be that belonging to Samuel Pepys who buried a chest of gold coins in his garden [think somewhere near Shorditch].

AA12349988	I answered another question on the subject last night.    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    You are wrong the grandparents wanted to adopt but where told they where too old - they would have had as much of an issue with a heterosexual couple just that the Mail would not have reported on it.      I have several issues with the adoption process and thinks it needs amending - if anyone is really that interested read the link.    However this question is about the reporting in the Daily Mail and it is some of the most disgusting that I have ever seen from this newspaper. It constantly refers to there sexuality with quotes like "the gay couple" or the "gay men".  It is not even thinly veiled but blatant.  I am sure the mail is trying to compete with the Sun for the most disgusting newspaper in Britain.    Carbuncle - can you please provide evidence that gay men commit more child abuse than hetrosexual ones.   -   as there isn't one maybe you should try changing your reading habbits or get out more.....    Edit Marcus     Both Shannon Matthews and Baby P where brought up in normal family unit - at least according to your definintion.  I beg to differ that they had any semblance of a proper unbringing nor are they examples of normal family life.    It is clear you know nothing about either adoption or its process or you would not be spouting the rubbish you have.    Additionally the question is not about the rights and wrongs of adoption either hetro or homosexual but of the way it has been reported.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	I am sure that I would feel exactly the same as the children's family. I have nothing against homosexuals in principle but do not believe that they should be allowed to adopt or foster children.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	The grandparents spent two years fighting any kind of adoption, but had to give up when, unlike social services they ran out of money.    When they objected to the children being adopted by a gay couple they were told that unless they 'reconsidered' their views they would never be allowed to see the children again.    I'd call it bullying and corruption of power not sensationalist journalism or homophobia. But of course, choosing gay adoptees they think they can shoot all objections down in flames whether they are homophobic or not.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	It's not even thinly veiled!|`|i2wbADHbaa	The Daily Mail loves it when it gets to promote bigotry, racism or homophobia.|`|5tsyS7Kpaa	Nothing suprises me about what the Daily Heil print. It is sickening to see this kind of homophobia maquerading as news. Interestingly the part of the story that intereste me most was not reported on; How are the kids doing? The whole adoption process was gone thrigh for their welfare.    Why doe anyone think that a same-sex couple in a stable relationdhip would molest their kids?|`|6ZfJpOKpaa	I am in no way supporting homophobia but there is some evidence that does suggest if a child grows up with single sex parents, they are more likely to have sexual confusion when they become older. You also have to think, if these people are used to the 'norm'; the thought of their grandchild becoming gay or being with gay couples (which was less socially accepted in their time) would make them stop what they are doing.|`|534b588aabc2f9470b492f99f7d98b2baa	How can it be homophobia if the storey is materially factual?

Children should be brought up in a proper family unit wherever possible, that means by a man and a woman, this gives the semblance of a proper upbringing and shows an example of family life .|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Am I amazed?

They are being blackmailed and that is illegal in this country....and the daughter is a RECOVERING drug addict, she doesn't do drugs now and hopefully she can get her life back on track...some people do you know!

It is false to say that they are radicalised as this is how many think in the normal way of following their faith.  It is a way of justifiying their actions to say that the terrorists are radicalised - to try to distance them from the so called moderate muslims, many of whom are not that moderate.

It's nothing new.|`|MLLCn4weaa	I don't suppose it was any one thing or any one person.  I suppose, ultimately the Mullahs must account for a large part of it.  In the 70s in places like Iran and Afghanistan the popular government and the chattering classes were becoming more and more Westernised.  The more secular they became, the less power the Mullahs would have. Also, the poorer less educated Muslims from more rural areas were probably jealous of the wealth and freedoms their counterparts had.  Where there is jealousy and a clawing back of power - you'll find bitterness and a ruthlessness.  It was this sentiment that people like Reagan and Thatcher capitalised on.    However, in the end - everyone has the ability to choose their own path.  You can't radicalise someone unless they are open to those ideas.  The individuals themselves have to take the main bulk of responsibility.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Read the Koran - its the book Muslims follow and there is alot there from Mohammed telling them to do bad stuff already.

Its even worse, some guy in the Navy was found guilty of rape by a victim who only remembered the assault after visiting an alternative practitioner who 'recovered' the memory by waving a white stick in front of her face.

There is a group who have set up a charity to care for these abandoned boys, boys who have never even ventured outside the community, but suddenly find themselves torn from their family using the excuse of minor transgressions of the cults strict rules.    My own view is that someone who is able to manipulate this situation, to convince several women to marry him is either a sucker for punishment, or a confirmed narcissist.|`|rJ4V4NkIaa	i don,t agree with having all these wives it is not fair to the women how would men like it if a women had no end of husbands they would not and also i think they class women as slaves to their lust and it is an excuse to have young girls no different then paedophile but they hide behind religion|`|7p2IknBOaa	If all of the wives, or all of the husbands for that matter, consent to their partner having multiple marriages, then I'm fine with that.|`|rFoKf7ieaa	I think we should abolish all secular benefits for marriage since we obviously can't agree with each other what it is. It's either a religious ceremony or its not.|`|AA12386598	I do keep wondering when I see the way the media and state behaves when some polygamists are discovered. Would they behave the same way if they discover a gay compound.  Oh shucks how could I forget 'gay is good' they don't have kids.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	We have a similar situation in the UK whereby polygamy is illegal yet it can be allowed on religious grounds. Personally I found one wife to be more than enough. Having two might damage both ears.|`|AA10283080	I think polygamy could work if it were a two way street and women were allowed to have more than one husband at a time also.    But as it is right now polygamy is reserved for men only and most often involves the direct or indirect abuse and misery of those women.    So as it is I am against the abuse of the women who are involved in polygamous marriages but I'm not against the actual marriage unless the woman is being prevented from marrying other men also.|`|My65doewaa	I'm kind of split on the issue..    First, it doesn't make sense for it to be legal to have affairs to multiple partners but be illegal to marry them.    On the other hand, I'm opposed to changing laws to meet the whims of every fringe group or deviant in our society.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	If polygamy or polyandry take place between consenting adults why should other people care?  But there's always a hard core of vocal and often religious busybodies who want to impose their views on others.   Reagan said it's the government's job to protect people from others, not from themselves; I wish more politicians would have the courage to act on that.

If7d3qJIaa	The best way to get into any career in journalism is to continue to study to the highest academic level you can whilst trying to get as much work experience from you local newspapers/radio/television stations during the summer breaks, also with the world of the internet at your disposal set up you own blog try to set it apart from others by trying to come at it from an unexpected angle one example would be a blog collecting other peoples view of current issues in sports (pay,drugs,whatever) from lots of different minority sports that you might find in you local area and contrasting it with the majority sports fans views, though i'm sure you can think of much better ideas, this will set you apart from the crowd when it comes to interviews
AA10283080	Both of them should be sterilized now.    And that couple that has 18 kids should have been sterilized a long time ago.    There is no logic in having that many children in today's society.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Lots of hatred there, with little reason.  Try anger management.    Since the kids were conceived by artificial means that means that the couple must have some money or at least be employed, that's not a cheap or paid-for-by-the-government thing.  Usually the doctors try to make sure such large numbers of fetus' don't all grow to maturity, as it increased the chances for the death of all the fetus'.  And the strain on the mother is very difficult to in carrying that many.  I don't see as much happiness, as I do simple curiosity, and maybe a sense of relief that we each have only one or two at a time for the most part, and we know how difficult that is, having eight at one time is more or less amazing.  That they have all lived is very rare.|`|stRWElvPaa	They already have 6 other children!  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnew...

A few families having a lot of kids will not drain our resources. That is such a total myth and the statement of an ignorant person. First of all, if this country would stop being so greedy, we would have an infinite amount of resources by just recycling, DUH! And the statements about tax payers being burdened. They pay taxes to! And how are we being burdened? No matter what the tax dollars go towards, you're still gonna be paying them. Maybe you should complain about something more worthwhile like how YOUR tax dollars go towards funding artists who make ugly, offensive, disgusting art work or how our tax dollars go towards the mansions and yachts of all those government officials! The more children the better I say! This country has such a disgusting attitude towards children and the parents who have them. I don't think people have enough children. They are so into themselves that they complain about just having one child. So I say congrats to the mom and I hope all her babies will grow up happy and healthy.|`|kXoV5JnWaa	they will eventually be a total nuisance to all their neighbours once the media have finished with them they already have 6 .is the doctor who did this going to pay for his ego masturbation i dont think so .it will be the people of California see if arnie will chip in|`|F211fxNFaa	Not "everyone" is so happy about this event.

AA12074066	I think the post office in nucking futs about this stupid idea and I order from e-bay daily and I need to get my stuff a.s.a.p and this will cause me to switch to amazon which is more expensive and I hate there payment section and I need all my bills when they are coming and I think they should just raise the postal rates again and the stamp rates again also. I think this is a terrible idea that they have and I hope that it never ever ever comes true cause if it did I would go postal and move to another country and I think someone should start a petition ask usps to keep it 6 days a week instead of 5 days that would totally stink. Good question and sorry about the rant but this tickes me off so bad you just dont understand.|`|AA11100770	All for it but it will never happen ( maybe a bit biased as i want my saturdays off).  Seriously though while i don't think it will happen (though it has been kicked about for 10 years now) it would save Royal Mail tens of millions a year.  Plus side businesses generally send post out during week getting bills/junk/advertising on a friday or monday instead of Saturday wouldn't really affect anybody as Saturday isn't really a good day for paying stuff and most firms customer servicesare based about 8am-8pm weekdays.  Negative side packets/birthday cards/presents would have to be sent earlier if birthdays was at weekend , vital stuff like documents ,legal stuff ,emergency items like medicine,electric key meters ,passports that are sent registered mail at great cost would be 2-3 days later .    So for me the negatives out balance the positives which is why it has never really been seriously pursued (yet) , they kick it out as a rumour every now and again to see what the public reaction is, then it gets put away again .|`|XTopfG8Taa	I am fine with it.

gGZz2EGyaa	Thank goodness for that I thought I was alone in my opinion of celebrities.  In the newspaper they announced all the celebrities who were appearing on the Big Brother and I had not heard of some of them. Perhaps we are all celebrities because we log onto Yahoo Answers, it does not take much to have 'celebrity' tag to your name.   The word celebrity just seems to be a tag that they stick on someone when they feel like.  In the past you were a star and everyone knew who you were and what you done, not these days.|`|DphUE9tbaa	You've probably got a life.  Shame on you.|`|oOR511mFaa	I dont either.

As for the nod, unfortunately he violated military protocol.  The same as the guards at Arlington have a very strict protocol in every aspect of their lives while assigned to guard the tomb of the unknown solder, so must those that participate in the the inaugural celebration in any capacity.  Internationally speaking - the guards at Buckingham Palace also have a strict protocol.  That's why they don't even deviate their eyes while on guard.  We base much of our history in the actions of loyalty and this is one way to show honor and respect.

An international incident is when a country or someone from one country does something awful to another country or person of that country.      Idiotic things happen in this society every day, like the Dallas school teacher who got fired for taking her class to the Dallas Art Museum because nude sculptures were among the exhibits.  At least, this man didn't lose his job.  He just quit the organization, which is the appropriate action to take when you disagree with a rule this strongly.  In a communist country he would probably have been required to wave and he would have been jailed if he did something the government found offensive.      President Obama can't possibly respond to every event of this type.  If he wanted to be idolized, wouldn't he have made the man Hero of the Week or something?|`|VlzlPAEwaa	i am not sure, but it looked innocent to me..i didn't understand what was wrong, can any body collaborate|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	Notice how Obama is making a very big deal about LITTLE things, like the nod and Rush Limbaugh.

Landis claims that he owns part of the rights to the "Thriller" video, so the show can't be adapted without him. Landis also claims that he hasn't been compensated for profits made from the video over the years, including merchandise, videogames, etc. This has nothing to do with Michael Jackson being rich.

7BJ0YScwaa	You seem to know a lot about this situation but I don't think it will work that way. America is in debt to many countries including massive debt to China, but the flip side is China is trying to bail itself out of a bad investment desperately as well (investment in America).   If the US doesn't sell bonds to China, they will have to print more money, if they print more money, the dollar value will go down, if the dollar value goes down, thier debt gets higher and they will atract less investment ffrom overseas and things will spin out of control until the US is a third world country. China doesn't want that to happen, neither do the other countries holding US Bonds, so they continue to buy more and more Bonds. If the USD goes down the toilet then thier Bonds become worthless and they go down the drain too.   They would agree at the time the bill comes due to restructure the debt into more Bonds likely as cashing them in is not an option since it would sink both of them.  Now, If they keep buying Bonds, at some point if the US economy doesn't recover fast enough, the debt of the US will become so high that it will become over-valued and become unstable and the again, it will become a third world country taking everyone down with it.  The only solution is to get the US economy back on track yesterday, but that's a tall order. Just as oil subsidizes human life by allowing us to produce more food than we could without it, faith in the stability of the US market is what has subsidized it's citizens to be able to be wealthier than others, but they've run out of "oil" and faith from international investors is wavering. Almost zero FDI is going to the US these days and I don't think there is any way Obama or anyone else is going to be able to turn that around. You guys need like a diamond mine to be found in Florida or to get the NAU off the ground by next week or something to that effect and I just don't see it. It's an ominus time.|`|F211fxNFaa	No one says China "should" pay for our mistakes. When they lending us money, it is with the expectation that we will pay it back. You know, that "full faith and credit" thing.    If paying debt were as simple as printing more paper money, we would just print the money rather than borrowing in the first place. Believe me, it is MUCH more complicated than that! Nothing is stopping the Chinese from spending money on their own interests. We buy so much from them that it is in their best interest to do what they can to keep us buying and they see propping up our industries as one of them. Without the American consumer buying their goods, they would have very little money at all. have you taken a look lately at where most of your goods are made?

As Napoleon said "Let China sleep, for when she awakes she will shake the world."

They're the ones who keep trusting the US to give the money back in a short time!!    And China spending money on Chinese interests? How much money does China spend on its own people anyway? Do you have any idea how many people in China live in poverty and under $20 a month? I'll give you a hint. They more than double the amount of people who live beyond their means in China.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	because no one cares|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	America is spoiled and stupid.

5uZ8wwouaa	There are many, but the one that is at the top 10 is how much jail time rapists and child molesters get. If you rape someone or attempt to rape someone you should go to jail for life right away and the same for molesting a child. All the medical help in the world cannot cure someone like that. If they did it once, they will do it again.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	1.  The fact that they have criminalized "moral" behavior.  The only criminal action should be one which directly conflicts with the rights of another.  Prostitution, gambling, and drug offenders clog up our prison system and cost billions of dollars a year to deal with, yet their "crimes" shouldnt be crimes in the first place.    2.  Every police force in the country is rife with corruption.  Officers using the shield to commit abuse, traffic, gun and drug violations.    3.  The police are notoriously underpaid and underfunded in many places, especially high cost coastal cities.  Many of these officers risk their lives every day, and cant even afford to live in the community they protect.   This leads to a low officer count, and a lower quality of officer in general as the best and brightest go towards more lucrative prospects.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	If your making money for the US all is forgiven(creating jobs). If your making money for yourself, then your a criminal. Examples, look at the many rappers that have form companies. These people admit their crimes on records, but because so many people make money off of them, that those things are over looked.|`|7BJ0YScwaa	Gun Control.|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	We don't have control at all. Violence is spreading, even the police use it against people. Who knew...|`|FEb0qWoVaa	People get away with too much too easily.    The country needs to *crack down* on drugs, (which is the center of a ton of the crime)    They also need to crack down on gangs.    Illegal immigration too. Every time I go to my local news site, there's always some crap involving the illegal mexicans.     Gang activity and drugs should be punishable by death. That would solve a lot of problems, reduce crime, and prisons wouldn't be AS cluttered.|`|ZFEtrB39aa	We only seem to catch the petty criminals.

vVd8yFdIaa	Bloggers is right, but I just want to expand.     Magazine publishers are for-profit entities.  As such, their final goal is obvious.  That doesn't mean they don't have ANY dedication to printing things that are truthful, but these days the line between the National Enquirer and the New York Times is getting more and more blurry.  Most magazines don't print articles written by "any wacko," but their pieces are generally written quickly and (though sometimes researched and fact-checked) without the kind of scientifically-based review that journals have.      If you delve into this further, you'll find that even within the community of peer-reviewed journals, there are the strong and the weak. In any event, peer reviewers are supposed to examine the originality of the work and also its methods of research before allowing it to move to publication, and this is always done by multiple reviewers.    Here's something else to consider:  Who writes for the journals?  Certified academic experts in a given field.  This is only occasionally the case for magazine articles, where experts are consulted, interviewed, and quoted.  But their words are then filtered by the writer and editors.  It may or may not come out the way the source intended.|`|F211fxNFaa	Publications such as newspapers and magazines are very jaundiced. They reflect the opinions of the writer and the publisher. For example, did you ever notice how the news media always seems to push Democratic ideas down our throats, or did you swallow without thinking about it! Not all Demo ideas are bad, but the media is democratic and pushes the democratic agenda.    Peer reviewed sources have less of a chance of being jaundiced, although the peers who review them could have been tainted by the media. There is a better chance of getting real, honest facts, however.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The advantage of peer reviewed articles is that they don't let through just any wacko idea of the day. By having to pass through examination prior to publication, the facts that they claim have considerably more authority.    However, the use of peer reviews by an ossified estalbishment can also lead to perfectly good ideas not receiving the recognition they deserve.
mnTSuVJSaa	Well im currently studying for a BA in journalism at university so i would recommend one of those, theres alot of competition among magazine businesses these days so its becoming much harder to acquire a job with the big names, especially with the internet becoming a much more popular medium. To becomea  travel writer i wouldnt have thought you would need any kind of qulaification for that, unless its a travel magazine. getting it published is the difficult part, especially if you've appeared from  nowhere with no previous experience or qualifications.

AA10283080	No.    I know that a lot of our tax money goes to support men with multiple wives and numerous children and I think that's wrong.

If they want more than one wife it would be a good idea if they could afford to support them.  I understand that if they come from Pakistan they can claim for wives here and there. Why not just go to Pakistan and get a job and support these women?    If they have more than one wife in Britain they should be imprisoned. Religious law should not take precedence over the law of the land they CHOOSE to live in.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	I have no problem with multiple spouses, so much as all parties agree, and they are not producing children that must be reared by the tax payer.

They make all of their own peanut butter on site and do not buy from companies like Peanut Corporation of America. (P.S.: They never bought milk from China, either. Hmm... I know what I'm eating this Valentine's Day.) Still, the CDC and FDA are urging consumers not to consume any peanut butter products until this investigation has concluded.|`|g6OfFgzlaa	Eat in Peace!   From Reuters: Posted Thu Jan 29, 2009 4:43pm GMT    CHICAGO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Hershey Co (HSY.N), maker of Reese's peanut butter cups candy, reiterated on Thursday that it does not buy peanut butter or other products from a company at the center of a major salmonella outbreak.    Hershey said none of its products had been affected by the recall of items produced by the Peanut Corporation of America.    The outbreak, which has sickened more than 500 people, has been linked to eight deaths.    On Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that Peanut Corporation would expand its recall of peanut products.    Hershey said it made its own peanut butter for Reese's peanut butter cups and that all of its products with peanuts or peanut butter were safe to consume.    Hershey shares were up 36 cents at $37.71. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; Editing by Ted Kerr)|`|PvAeyMpIaa	They're safe, no doubt. Hershey's makes their peanut butter on site.    And anyway, people are making wayy to big of a deal out of salmonella.      1. The chance of you getting salmonella from the peanut butter is VERY VERY slim.      2. It isn't as dangerous as you think!! It's basically the flu.        I've been eating peanut products since the recall all the time.

SLfmBjkOaa	This is very tragic and the real victims in all of this are the kids. They didn't ask to be born and certainly didn't ask to be killed because their parents got laid off. I think another problem for us living in a developed nation is that we tend to have a sketchy view of what poverty is. Most countries don't have car insurance or cable bills. In the U.S., you're considered poor if you can't afford cable and that's the mentality we live by. I'm sure these people that took these crazy measures weren't that bad off (compared to people in Haiti for example). They just had it so easy for so long that they didn't know what to do when it all came crashing down. Just a few weeks ago, I read about a German billionaire who jumped in front of a train because he lost millions......that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.|`|5uZ8wwouaa	This is not a new thing going on. It's been happening for years. Just google the name John List. Financial trouble was one of the reasons he killed them (of course he didn't kill himself). I really believe that these people had underlying mental issues. Families need to help each other during times of crisis. The government needs to help people with food, utilities, mortgage, rent, car insurance, health insurance, and car payments when someone hits a financial crisis. Afterall, those people paid taxes to. Why should my tax dollars go towards politican's yahts, murdering babies, or ugly art work. Tax dollars should go towards us when we need it.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	The father in these types of cases suffers from caretaker syndrome.  He believes that his family cannot live without him and so if he sees things going badly, it is necessary to kill not only himself but his family as well, to protect them from having to live without him.  This is different from the cases where the spouse kills separated or divorced family members and then themselves.      No amount of financial aid will stop these people, unless you plan on supporting them in the style they've been accustomed to for the rest of their lives.  And no company can possibly take on the responsibility of dealing with the entire group of people they need to lay off.  That is what they pay unemployment insurance for.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Ummm no.  Business doesn't have to make sure their workers do anything other than work.  Lately it can't even do that.  People who work do live to certain standards, like heat, housing, feeding the kids, when they see that gone it tears them apart, for people already having psychological problems it can be the tipping point.  As a country we stopped being concerned about the mentally frail back with Reagan's closing of the mental hospitals.  He said he would open smaller, community centers, which never came to pass.  So now our  true crazies are on the streets, how can we possibly pay for help for those who are only marginal?  Unemployment insurance is supposed to help out, but with an economy shedding jobs far faster than creating them, finding another job right now is nearly impossible.  This is only the beginning, there is worse to come, and our entire way of life and expectations will change, there is no easy way out.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	"THESE people need bailouts....LIFE SAVING bailouts.    They shouldn't just fire people without making sure they are going to be okay."    You're totally right. Companies don't care about their employees no matter how much they say they do. I was working for Qwest in Salt Lake City. They laid off THOUSANDS of people. (Google Qwest layoffs 2008) a ton of hourly employees, middle management, etc. Without notice, warning, or a 2nd thought. These are all people with bills to pay and families as well.     That's a shame about the article.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Unfortunately, I can see both sides to this argument.  The economy IS terrible, but it truly is affecting businesses as well as individuals.      Trust me, I'm not fan on big business (I've been unemployed for 3 months myself) and I hate the way they are treating people.  I believe that an employer has a right and responsibility to let people go when the extra labor threatens their business; not when it threatens their profits!  The difference being, if the layoffs are only so corporate junkies can keep more money in their pockets, then it's reprehensible.  However, if the entire company would go under without the layoffs, they are necessary.    However, judging by the increasingly quick speed at which the world seems to be careening out of control, I'd say the Bible was right and Revelation makes it clear that things will only get worse (until the Antichrist comes and brings a false, short-lived peace).    Thankfully, there is a Light at the end of the tunnel. :)|`|1hOTlMvaaa	As long as they keep people desperate and give no hope or help. I wondered which article  I was going to open the dad who shot his 5kids and wife from job loss,.I think they were fired for trying to get assistance with childcare for the two sets of twins and other kid, although they did not elaborate, or the old man that died because he froze to death in his home from not paying his bill> 93 yrs old and that is the best they could do for the poor old man!   This new one, is another terrible tragedy that did not need to happen. Yet when people lose jobs, homes and have to pay creditors with extra fee s and still cannot keep and live in their homes, some apply for help, and  if you are honest tough luck! Then we fork out money to banks that blow 40,000 on toilet! 1,400 on a trash container, sheez I m surprised they did not hire someone to wipe their buns too! Yet the ones that made this mess and helped create this are sitting on their hands saying No to the help for people, using lame excuses while supporting wall street.Sorry but it is all wrong, I think some one should investigate the finances of these "elected" people not working for the people as they claim, I ll bet they got some    free trips or something we do not see . The money for the banks, proved to be for the employees reward of stealing from many and failing and hitting the jackpot for their lame work. Still disaster of the Republican protection of the CEO , forget the working people, We saw the begining of that when Kmart had two hot shot CEOs that got govt bailout while stockholders lost tens of thousands, but not the big dogs! I still won;t shop there, not that they notice, why should they , they  can just get in line for more taxpayer money!

The government wouldn't be able to spend at least one-fourth of a proposed $825 billion economic stimulus plan until after 2010, according to a preliminary report by the Congressional Business Office that suggests it may take longer than expected to boost the economy. The government would spend about $26 billion of the money this year and $110 billion more next year, the report said. About $103 billion would be spent in 2011, while $53 billion would be spent in 2012 and $63 billion between 2013 and 2019.    ? Less than $5 billion of the $30 billion set aside for highway
b8f0CfSsaa	Stay calm (shouting gets you nowhere), back yourself up with facts and be seen to take in the other persons opinions. Its all about demeanor really, if you act arrogant and don't provide evidence you will get nowhere.|`|BoO62GMJaa	we have two rules    rule 1-Oban is always right    rule 2- in the unlikely event of Oban being wrong, rule 1 will apply|`|7BJ0YScwaa	Read sales books.    The first thing to understand is human nature, as in what drives people. All people are driven by the desire to be happy. Money, power, sex, drugs, rock & roll, fishing and dancing and everything else anyone does is to serve thier desire to be happy. Some better understand how to get and maintain happiness others don't but everyone is looking for it.  Next, you need to make people happy. As long as someone is happy to talk to you, you have the potential to change thier mind. If you get rude or challenge thier beliefs, they will get defensive and once that happens you can no longer truely change that persons mind. You start with two positives and then a negative. "You are very smart and well read, that's why I thought you'd be interested to hear what I've learned of." Start a sentence this way and you keep the lines of communication wide open and the listener receptive to your ideas.  A lot of questions on here are threatening or biased in tone (i'm guilty of it too sometimes) and so people answering are automatically put on the defensive when answering. Defensive is unhappy, unhappy is unconvinceable. Keep away from biasing your Q&A's and people will respond better.  People's opinions are reflect who they are as a person and so when you try to change someones mind, you are often trying to alter that persons reality and possibly some of thier core beliefs. That makes people very touchy as in when people talk politics. Getting a hardend Democrat to become a Republican supporter really takes that person from one reality to another. Keep in mind that as much as you believe your arguement to be true, they believe thiers to be also.  Finally, an important thing you should understand is that you can't argue facts, only opinions. So what you need to understand is that really winning an arguement (the other person genuinely changed thier mind) is very difficult as you are trying to alter how they feel about things. If your arguement is "Elephants are bigger than goats" then you are crazy. No one would argue that fact. If your arguement is "Elephants are better than mice" now you have a debate, but remember you aren't correct in your arguement. Point is to try to weigh the value of getting into such an arguement.   Many people argue for or against religion. People for it argue that it's true and you can't disprove it. People against it argue that it's untrue and you can't prove it. Again, you can't argue facts so you'll always be arguing your opinion. Just keep it in mind.|`|Uz16kQEYaa	Just state fact and never be detrimental.People can tell you know what you are talking about by the way you put it across.explaining your facts and knowledge on the subject is good.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	By stating the facts as you know them without in any way putting down someone who has a different opinion.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	You can't with everybody, they hear what they want to hear, see what they want to see.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	By admitting you are wrong, when you are.|`|AA11049477	Just make/state your point, then shut up.

What I have found really works is this...if you seem too sure of your position, people feel a instinctive urge to differ and not be convinced, it must be a power thing!

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	What is coming out of Al-Jezera(sp?) is as much, if not more, propaganda than is what is coming out of the US media. In fact, outside of "local interest stories" I'd dare to say (from what I've personally heard or been advised of), more a Propaganda rag than a media outlet.    As for Hamas's Terrorist roots, they are still plainly visible in the form of their Charter (the "Destruction of the Jewish State"), and their actions, inept or no. (Firing Military Grade Ordinance into Civilian Areas.)    The presence of arms in medical and food shipments (etc), are the reasons that those shipments are being stopped, so the bad guys in this case are not the IDF, or even the State of Israel itself, but the people trying to smuggle those arms in. Perhaps if they started spending money on roads and water instead of rifles and bombs, everyone in Gaza would be better off...and the blockades would go down. They may even find - much as Egypt and Jordan have found - that Israel, when left alone, is a neighbour that keeps more or less to itself - what in most places is considered the "Perfect" neighbour.    As for your Holocaust comparison...it is not entirely accurate...even in the broadest of strokes. The State of Israel is acting to protect itself from self proclaimed foreign aggression and terrorism. While I do NOT approve of many of the measures they have enacted (like the Security Wall), or actions taken (like firing on a UN compound). They, like any other government, are dealing with humans, and that means mistakes...so, when a surgical strike designed to take-out a specific high ranking Terrorist/Hamas member hits the wrong house, it's not malice that caused their deaths, it is bad information. Mind you, had he not been involved in the activities he is involved in, the house would have never been targeted.    Incidentally...when was the last time you heard of a high ranking member of any organisation that sponsors terroristic behaviour actually strap a bomb on his or her self and walk into a crowd to detonate it or walk into a crowded market and begin spraying the crowd with bullets? They don't...that's what the gullible and easily manipulated are for.    I am personally disgusted with the extremists on both sides, whether Palistinian or Israeli. The fact that BOTH sides are EQUALLY responsible for the state of things is unmistakeable to anyone who has no bias to any side.    I don't see anything changing until the people on BOTH sides put their pride aside and actually sit-down an HONESTLY air their concerns and LISTEN to what the other side is saying, and WORK to reaching a liveable compromise. Arafat did/tried to do that...but his efforts died with him. R.I.P.    I am neither Islamic, nor Jew. I believe that the worship of God should occur in the heart of the believer, and no where else. That their lives should be lived as an example of what their relationship with God leads them to, and not in an effort to force someone else to do the impossible - experience God in the same way as the aggressor does. Everyone experiences God in their own way, simply because we are not the same person, and all experience the World in a manner unique to ourselves.    Peace.|`|5O7op0oIaa	Where did you get this peculiar idea that Hamas were voted into power under free and demoratic elections?    And why do you conflate the Hamas militants with the civilian population? Two entirely different things altogether.      Lastly - what would you expect *your* government do do, theoretically, if your country was in receipt of daily rocket attacks from a neighbouring body controlled by violent psychopaths whose stated aim was to wipe you from the map?    This isn't quite so straightforward as you'd have us believe...|`|HUlyRTrraa	Boring.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Yes, everything you listed is a bit on the absurd side. The Israelis are keeping a tight lid on Gaza, but I've yet to see a viable option, considering Hamas in the past has used more open travel as a way to send kids with bombs into Israeli cities. There are some indications that many in the Gaza strip would prefer to eschew terrorism and accept a two-state solution, and if that turns the tide, then perhaps the IDF's action will have been worth it.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	To put it in the smallest nutshell that I can I'd say terrorism begets terrorists. Personally I don't approve of terrorism of any kind, all to often the wrong people suffer and the seeds of hatred and revenge are sown. Zionism in my opinion was a dangerous idea that was bound to create conflict, immigrant Jewish settlers used terrorism to establish the state of Israel, chaos has reigned  and we've seen atrocities from both sides since. Israel is every bit as responsible for this tragedy as anyone and if they weren't supplied by so much military might and unquestionable support from the US they would have had to come to some kind of reasonable terms.  That they continue to illegally settle stolen land doesn't help the situation, it makes it worse.|`|hktfe1UGaa	I still think you are ranting, and still need to learn how to use the spell check program.

The majority of people both Palestinian and Israeli do not care about Gaza and it is a small minority who are involved in this. Very similar to Northern Ireland before they got peace.  But if someone fired a rocket at me and I had a full arsenal to fire back - I would too.  Stop firing rockets then they won't fire back.  Dear god it's like my four year old son- I tell him don't hit me or i'll hit you back.  When I do he is shocked.  Why are they shocked?|`|rJ4V4NkIaa	i think that israel was murderers  and they should be tried for war crimes they had all the weapons, where gaza had a few rockets they wan,t all the land they have push the Palestine's in to the sea well near enough and stole the land i don't blame the ham-mas for what they have done  they just wan,t back what was theirs to start with, its like scotland keep taking a bit of england till of england has only a small Square of land to live in with all its people|`|AA11103493	It's far too complicated to be summed up in a few paragraphs.  I know very little of the issues however the way I see it: Israel claims the land because they say it was theirs thousands of years ago, the Palestinians claim pretty much the same.  The US backed Israel being set up as a state In the 60s and they never admit their mistakes so will always back Israel, plus there is a huge and powerful Jewish community in the US and the Government doesn't want to upset them because of the money/power thing.  People call Gaza's Government a terrorist organisation because that's what they (Hamas) were before they were elected. (One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist).  It's a bit like if Sinn Fein ruled Northern Ireland - they were the political arm of the Provisional IRA.  I can see this one running and running.  I doubt either side will ever give in because both claim it as their homeland, though I do think that Israel staking their claim was a bit of a cheek - to put it mildly.  As for the violence - Israel always pounds the cr@p out of their neighbours in retaliation for the odd rocket fired their way.  They always have and they always will.  I doubt that Israel and Palestine will ever be comfortable neighbours.|`|NeI9MOhKaa	listen i know that this is a mean thing to say but if these people want to kill themselves for land or other purposes then go right ahead but as long as they dont mess with the united states then we are all good. i do think its unfortunate for all the innocent people that will have to suffer|`|My65doewaa	1) Coming to power through a democratic process does not change who people are or what they do.  For example, Hitler came to power through a democratic process.. does that make everything he did OK?  Hamas is a terrorist group because they engage in terrorism, people voting for or against them is irrelevant in that discussion.    2) Occupying territory is not illegal, but regardless.. Israel pulled out of Gaza a few years back.  Hamas responded with more terrorism.  There would be no Israeli attack to defend against if Hamas stopped their attacks against Israel.      3) Israel allows aid and relief into Gaza, in fact Israel provides a lot of it.  They restrict the flow of goods in and out, but again you have to look at Hamas for the reasons why.  Hamas was bringing in more and more weapons to attack Israel with, Israel is well within it's rights to prevent arms from reaching terrorists.    4) Again, the flow of goods in and out of Gaza is restricted due to Hamas activities.  And Israel allows food convoys to pass.  Perhaps not while active fighting is going on, but on a regular basis.    5) If Israel wanted to take over Gaza, they wouldn't have pulled out.  If Israel wanted to wipe out the population of Gaza.. they could do it in a matter of hours.  That claim is not just a lie.. it's an idiotic lie.    6) Trying to compare a few hundred dead terrorists to the 10-20 million people ( not all were Jews ) Hitler ran through death camps it's also idiotic.    7) US media is not run by Israel.  It's run by people of every concievable political ideology and religion.  You people really need to understand that just because a media source doesn't provide the terrorist propaganda you want, that doesn't mean it's controlled by Israel.    What do I think...  I think you need to get a better understanding of the history of the conflict as well as a grasp on the reality of the current situation.  You could do this by getting your information from something other than known terrorist propagandists.|`|I8ZpZSCGaa	Its a fruitless conflict, Hamas has no chance against Israel, just like the Provisional IRA had no chance against the Loyalists and the British Army.  For everyone of theirs that was killed 10 were killed in response, a leading convicted Loyalist was killed ,in response by them 18 Catholics were murdered within a year .  I don't care what conflict it is or where but you don't attack civilians.  The Provies stuck a bomb inside a rubbish bin in Warrington Cheshire England and killed a child, what? like hows that help any cause?  But the whole thing is fruitless and only the innocent will suffer.  Theres these big square wooden things called tables, the only way to settle anything is by talking.  Ultimately Israel will not just win but destroy any country that opposes it.  Now we have these assholes the Real IRA, or continuity IRA whatever they're called trying to ensure the people they proclaim to fight for get a bullet through the back of their head on the way to work.|`|ExiYNaT9aa	I think your ideas are all wrong. This is a conflict that Americans can't truly grasp. We can listen to the media but you'll never get any truth out of the media. I'd suggest you do some hard core research on the Arab/Israeli conflict before you make a post like this. It seems to me that you're taking a side on a fight that has nothing to do with you.|`|AO32sw1oaa	I am most afraid of the fact that Israel has it's hands on an arsenal of Nuclear Weapons.  Are they only there to deter Iran?    Perhaps Israel could help rebuild impoverished areas of their county including the areas occupied by the Arabs, make sure all people under its control are treated equally and have access to the basic necessities. They could polish up their tarnished world appearance.    The USA blocking the UN from delivering humanitarian aide and the Israelis bombing a UN convoy delivering aide looks bad to the world, we need to rebuild our image and Israel has allot to do with our image in that region.    What about this boat that was struck in International waters with CNN anchors and one of our last elections presidential candidates?  That didn't receive much coverage, they were en-route to assess the situation and to deliver aide to Gaza...    The USA or the UN going into Gaza and helping to rebuild and making sure aide is received would be a start at relieving tension between our cultures.

We are giving away any sense of what is right & what is wrong as they've now blurred beneath barrage of human rights acts which beggar belief by giving the criminals more rights than the victims.  PC is dragging us all down.|`|CXFDQc16aa	it a load of s  t if ya ask me hahah|`|lPO4D8PLaa	personal computer?|`|QEEweJUaaa	It means Politically Correct|`|2ad4MT2baa	Gordon is a moron
