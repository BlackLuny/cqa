I found out my boyfriend is a member of MENSA, so he has an extremely high IQ. apparently he knows he is in the top 1% of the population or something.   since finding that out, i now feel incredibly inadequate. in my opinion i am ugly and not a nice person, so i already feel insecure and wonder why he is with me, despite him saying he loves me. but now, i feel even worse. i mean, i'm not stupid, i've always done well academically. but in comparison, i feel so inferior. why would someone like him want to be with someone like me?      :(

But I have a lot of trouble with quitting. The very thought of quitting really scares me. It's become some what of a comfort blanket. I was just wondering how long will it take to recover from the damage to my lungs from smoking? How long until I can work out and not loose my breath after 10 minutes?  Also, any words of advise on quitting? I have tried going cold turkey, it never works, and I don't have the money for nicotine patch rubbish. I am currently downloading a smoking hypnosis, which I hope works...Any advice is very much appreciated.

20090221045250AAJYEj7	Health;Mental Health	What do you do  if you feel your not liked very much by a lot of people?	i have a history of rage and aggression problems because of a hard life of victimization and bullying, sadly throughout my life - i used to have outburst in public that i couldnt control, because of stress, paranoia, racing thoughts, bottled up anger from being bullied and abused , jealousy of other people and ptsd symptoms, feeling threatened - i was diagnosed with borderline persoality disorder 3 years ago.      for years ive done well controlling my outburst and conduct, been seeking help , made alot of progress with my disorder, more sure of myself , who iam etc.      however i still suffer with very low self worth, feel insecure and worry what others think of me -- seek approval ,reassurance and acceptance from others , validation , worry about what they percieve or think about me.      i know its wrong and i work hard not to be like that, and on the whole i feel its a battle im winning within myself.      however sometimes i lose it and get angry if people criticize me, dont accept me, dont validate me or give me approval. or if they make me feel ' set apart ' or ' disincluded '.      at the times of my rage problems years ago, in the community i feel i was being ostracized by people in the local community , and i feel they alienated me to. socially alienated me etc.      things i think have improved as ive managed my behaviour, im becoming less aloof and defensive with people, -----             but i notice alot still  some people in my local community are still stand-offish, aloof , in certain shops , stores, supermarkets etc ----- i still feel singled out by lingering looks, stares , feel disincluded and set apart still by others.....treated as a charity case   like  an oxfam kid or something.            im not sure   if its because people have pre conceptions about me or see me in a negative light, or as some type of outcast....but i admit, this behaviour by people still bothers me, and makes me feel : ANGRY.         i just want to assimilate, be accepted , but i wont bow down to peoples feet either to be accepted - iam who iam and thats it, i wont be treated as a charity case who needs acceptance in an obvious parody situation.               also - i feel some people ' see ' my social difficulty and dilema , and want to try exploit this or take advantage of it - and act like- ' i need them to accept me ' and like a charity case or ' where else have i got to go ? '         i feel enraged towards those types of people and angry because of my pride , and i reject them or are aloof to them - because i know of no other ways to deal with them..            so how do i handle this behaviour ?            the types  of people  that are slimey --belittling  and condescending ---- that come into your life and say things over exaggerated like --- '' yeah yeah dude, i was like that to, ya know , i know what you feel like, dude i was like you ''            i really passionatly hate people like that------      who are not genuine, but just want to exploit you

20090221013415AAXepFf	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Are we becoming too clean?	Being brought up in the 30's/40's I was taught that 'cleanliness was next to Godliness'.With our very limited hard soap and no hot running water (particularly during the war years) our washing facilities were basic, yet we kept ourselves clean and tidy. When we fell and scraped ourselves the wound (if it was bleeding) would be washed with water and iodine applied before bandaging. The next day, still sore, it would be left open to the elements to scab over. Colds? Wrap up and stay indoors for a couple of days. Central heating? None, boil the water needed even for a bath.   I remember Tyrozets (spelling ?) having to be prescribed for throat infections, but can now be purchased over the counter.   Yesterday on the news it was announced that those suffering from nut allergies can be cured when given small doses over a period of time. What a surprise!   Surely it's better for us to develop our own immunities as we grow - 'a bit of good honest dirt won't hurt you, son.'  my Dad used to say as he applied salty water to my grazed knee.

When this kid in my nephew's (Ryan, he's nearly 15) form said to him "well at least my dad isn't dead" and then pushed him over, stamped on his stomach and kicked him (Ryan's dad was my brother, he died last year) i got called in to discuss what had happened with Ryan's form tutor, Ryan, the kid that did that and his dad. While discussing it the kid said something else about his dad being dead i just lost it with him and was shouting at him so i grabbed his collar so his dad try's to get me off and because i was so angry i pinned him against the wall and raised my fist to punch him because he said it served Ryan right (all Ryan did was call the kid and idiot) Eventually Ryan's form tutor took me out the room and calmed me down. I try to be a role model, someone Ryan can look up to but i think he's a bit scared of me now and so is my sister but i can't help being so protective over them. They are all i have right now, they are my only family and i just don't want to see them get hurt or upset and i don't want to lose them like i lost my brother and parents, it just makes me angry but i don't know why      please help

When we got to the hospital we were told the changes were glandular rather that squamous and that this is a bit more serious. They referred to it as CGIN rather than CIN.      She had a LLETZ treatment and we are awaiting the results.  Problem is, there is very little info around regarding CGIN, its all about CIN.  Obviously we are really worried about the results and the seriousness of the situation.      Has anyone been diagnosed with this in the past? Had treatment? Any advice or experience shared would be most appreciated.  I am trying to arm myself with as much info as possible so I can be prepared for my sisters - she seems to be in her own world at the moment, understandably, and when she is ready to ask I want to be able to give her the answers.

If I pass some test or somebody gives me a compliment I just shrug it off. It's hard to explain, it's like I know some things should make me happy but it doesn't happen. For example, I should be ecstatic because I've got loads of good uni offers in the last few weeks, but I've found myself not caring.   Does that make sense?      Is there any treatment for anhedonia? I feel like all the joy has gone from my life.      Thanks for any answers.

The report says that 40% of children under the age of three are underweight and a third of all men and women suffer from chronic energy deficiency.       Almost three quarters of India's population - some seven hundred million people - live in rural areas.       They work in labour intensive occupations and so require more energy than urban Indians, the report says          http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_a...

I was super swollen the next 2 days, cheeks and everything. I have been on antibiotics since right after the procedure, so I doubt it is infection. I have not eaten or smoked or drank through a strw. However, the gums get REALLY swollen and tender. When I am sleeping or laying down they are not really bad. When I get up in the morning or from a nap they swell up and hurt. Is that normal?I also have only worn my dentures here and there. The first day and night I kept them in per my dentists orders. The next day I kept them out all day like he said. Yesterday, I wore them for 3 hours only. Haven't put them in yet today. I have been prescribed tylenol 3 but have been taking ibuprofen instead because it helps control swelling.  Will this just subside? I really do not want to go back there. The first time was fun enough. He saw me on day 2 and day 4 and said everything looked fine.

I have been working with a trauma therapist which has brought to light some major traumas from childhood and late teens.  I am still to work on these.  My therapist has been really ill for the past few months and has decided to give up work as I don't think she can face going back to it after what she has been through.  She is such a lovely person.      I feel very lost, scared and alone and I don't know how I am going to cope with anything anymore.  I still have these two other major traumas I need to work on, because I can't just bury them and forget them like I did before.  The flashbacks are petrifying and very distressing.      I see a psychiatrist who is sorting out my meds, every 4 to 6 weeks.  I have a care worker who is off work at the moment with a broken foot.      I am struggling, I just don't know where to turn.  I don't feel like I have any hope of getting better now.  I miss my partner tremendously and I wish he were here now to hold me tight.      What can I do?  I feel in great distress and despair?

Everytime after I have sex (which is protected) I get a yeast infection. I went to the doctor for it the first time and she took some of my vaginal fluid or as I call it "vaggiie cheese" and she said well it's not that much so it could just be irritation. Sooooo I was suppost to make an appointment with the gynocologist but only the male doctor is in until March. & Idk about anyone else but I'm not really comfy with some guy looking into my coochie professional or not I've seen some weird movies. & I don't really think it's per-say a yeast infection. I think it's irritation. It's barely any "vagiie cheese" and it just itches like wooow. No burning and I don't have any HIV symptoms and the dude I'm with doesn't even have health insurance. No job and no health insurance he can't afford HIV medication.

Also, I can't eat whenever I like, the boarding house has rules on when we are supposed to be in the dining hall to eat our meals. It's an English Church all-girls private boarding school (even though it's not in England), so it's pretty strict.      I'm a South-East Asian girl, age about 17 year old. I moved to Australia to attent this school, but since then I've been gaining about 7 or 8 Kg (about 14 or 16 pounds or 70 or 80 ounces) in about 2 and a half years! Because of that I look real chubby on the face and have a big tummy or stomach, I look like an at least 2 months old pregnant woman (literally) ;( I also have chubby tights now...      It would be really nice and will make me so much happier & more confident if I can lose these much weight & fat in about 6 weeks. Much nicer & way more happier if less than 6 weeks ;) :)      Please also take into account that I want to lose all these weight & fat for may be forever, I don't want to gain them again after I stop with all the diet & work-out :) :)      I also want to get down about 2 or 4 size smaller in clothing. Does anyone know on how to make my shoulder smaller? Not by cutting my bones... LOL      I will read every suggestion and appreciate them all! Also, please don't be rude... :)   Thank you very very much and God bless you all and your family and friends! (if you believe in God that is...)      NOTE: I'm so sorry if it's getting too long...
20090221054446AAZkN90	Health;Diet & Fitness	A whole day without eating?	Okay. So I really am trying to lose weight (& fat!). These are things that I heard about 'a whole day without eating at all & only drinking mineral water', I don't know which 1 is true and which 1 is not.      1. You can lose weight by doing so.   2. You will only gain more weight (& probably fat as well) by doing so.   3. It's good, because by doing so, you are cleansing your body (some systems in your body).      If number 3 is correct, I'm thinking of doing this once every week. Is it okay? Is it healthy? Will I gain weight and/or fat by doing it?      Any suggestion & explanation would be highly appreciated!   And please don't be rude... :)   Thank you very much!      NOTE: It'll be really nice if you can also answer my 1 other question in the diet & fitness category. Thank you very much and God bless you & your family & friends! (if you believe in God) ;) :) :)

Please give me advice! yall are the best :)      also i wake up around 7 get to school at 8 get home around 4 and go to bed around 11      i don't have time during school to eat small meals except lunch. the best i can do is eat before, during, and after school and then eat dinner around 7. also, my school has pizza, breaded chicken, bagels, and sandwiches (with deli meats and cheese...and the line is soooo long!)      and i could start bringing my lunch but i don't want to seem like im on a diet so what is something unobvious that i could bring? Most people bring sandwiches and fruit.      I'm 16, 5'2 and weigh 140 by the way. i would never go too far dieting (trust me! i can't even go 2 days without ruining my diet anyway...) so don't worry about that. im just sick of trying to get this weight off and being miserable (i've been trying to lose it since 8th grade and now im in 10th! Its all i think about! it bothers me SO much and it prevents me from doing a lot of stuff because im insecure about it...)      thank you so much guys!!! God Bless!

But it has been a recurring dream now.. every night and I think about it alot.      That's not what's weird though. What's weird is I feel like a different person. I woke up and ever since I've been in some sort of messed up world. Every sound I hear echo's loudly through my head. I find it hard to focus my eyes. I find it hard to speak more than a few words because it feels like something has disconnected.       I think as I normally would - stupid unimportant thoughts but I find it hard to connect them to emotions - my boyfriend said he loved me which usually makes me smile but I just registered it as a sentence and no more.      I feel like I'm viewing my life as a movie, and not actually connecting with it. I feel like something inside me died.. or broke.. I look in the mirror and recognise the face but I just see another person, not me as I usually see..      I can't go to the doctor because I live rurally and it's really hard to get to one..

20090203094354AAxTNJl	Health;Women's Health	2 Birth Control Pills in One Day?	Okay, I did something dumb.  I've been taking birth control for over a year, never missed a pill.  So when I looked at my pack last night and saw the Tuesday one was still there, I was very surprised that I'd "missed a pill."   This morning I was smart enough to realize that today is Tuesday.  I've been off work this week due to weather conditions, so I'm all mixed up.     So now I have no Tuesday pill.  Do I take the Wednesday one instead, or just skip it?  This isn't a concern of preventing pregnancy, by the way.  The pill is a backup method for me, mostly used to regulate my periods and control pain.  I use condoms as my primary method of birth control.   Thanks, guys. I feel really dumb about this.   P.S.  Oh, and if it makes any difference: I take Yaz, but this is my first pack, I was on Yasmin for the year before that.

20090219174042AAoIwPM	Health;Mental Health	Should I Go To Therapy?	PLEASE ANSWER      Okay well I don't have any major life issues... but I'm a 16 year old and I feel as if I'm going through a lot of stress and I'm not exaclty sure how to cope with it all. I'm not depressed but ever since I remember - grade 9 I was depressed until I decided that I was going to change my life around (with a little inspiration). I narrowed down the reasons why I feel this way and created goals for myself to do in order to be happier. I'm no longer a negative thinker like I used to be, I'm pretty positive but I get times where I feel like I'm going no where in life, and because of this I feel like I'm going to go back into depression. I need help completing these goals because I've been trying for two years, I've improved but I haven't improved as much as I'd like to.   Also I have a bit of a self esteem issue (it's not that big) and I have kind of a social axiety (i'm shy and sort of scared of people).       So do you think going to therapy is right for me? Am I even suppose to go to therapy for problems that aren't even that big?   Or do you think I can solve these on my own or with another source?      Please answer, I need opinions
20090219175125AA0iTdW	Health;Other - Health	Birth control pill + VCF?	I'm currently taking an antibiotic that can reduce the effectiveness of my birth control pills. My doctor advised I use a back-up method of contraception until my next cycle (by then I'll be off the antibiotics).      Sex with condoms has never been especially enjoyable for my boyfriend OR me, but especially for him - even the thinnest seem to dull his sensitivity and prevent climax. Once we both tested clean for everything and confirmed ourselves monogamous, we stopped using them altogether, quite some time ago.      I can't seem to find the contraceptive "sponge" over the counter anywhere. I bought some vaginal contraceptive foam. If used properly, in conjunction with taking my birth control pills properly, how effective is the VCF as a backup?      I much prefer it to condoms if we can at all help it. But if I know I'm at a drastically increased risk despite the VCF, we'll use them anyway. FYI the antibiotic I'm taking is cephalexin (Keflex).

I'm 16, I have vaginal hair, periods, boobs, etc. but i don't have armpit hair, not even one strand! I'm happy about it but i'm just wondering if it's unusual. i'm glad i don't have to shave yet, but i'm just wondering, i know it will come eventually.        Also, I have discharge that's sometimes clear and gooey but it has a strong nasty smell to it, it used to be so bad that when i would be sitting in a desk and i spread my legs and put my leg on like the side of the chair or something, i could smell it, but noone else could, luckily. one time it was a dark yellow but it was only one time. my periods are irregular and heavy, like so heavy that the super maxi pads are flooded and i get blood on my underwear, lightly though. don't worry, it's hereditary, there's nothing wrong with the period. also, it's been getting better and usually i can't smell it any more, but could i have had an infection and then it went away?       also I'm a virgin. i got my first period when i was 13 or 14, i don't remember, it was in the 7th grade.       also, do you think my boobs are big? my bra size is 36DD. my big boobs are hereditary too. my grandma had such big boobs when she was young that she had to have a reductiong because it was causing back pain.
20090219171955AAT7nJi	Health;Women's Health	How much does virginity matter?	I am atheist so I don't have any religious ideals holding me back really. I am usually a person who "plays by the rules" no drugs, no alcohol, i'm kind, strong sense of morals. this is one thing I can't seem to find a strong moral stance on. I don't plan on having children, there are already children in orphanages I don't need to make more. Not sure if I'll get married but that will probably change when i'm older.    The whole virginity until marriage thing was a custom from nobles trying to marry off their daughters easier, commoners didn't abide by it unless the church was a main part of every day life. it's all from religion! I know that you should wait because by the time you're married you should be mature enough to make it safe, but I'm not stupid.    I'm not saying I'd do it any time in the near future at all either.   Can you give me a concrete reason for me to wait. All I can think of is it mattering to a possible future groom. Is that a really big deal?

How does this work? I thought this test needed blood to be done but how would you do that by yourself? Do you actually have to draw your own blood for the test?!? Anyone who knows please help. Thank you!

I have always had messy writing, and the joints in my hands, wrists and fingers starts to ache after I have written about half a page of A4. I also experience problems when I kneel down for a short amount of time and then stand up, becae when i stand up I feel a sharp pain in my knees, which lasts for a few seconds. Finally, I have had problems with the right hip since Novemever 2008, when I slipped on an icy road. I have never seeked medical advice about this as the pain in my hip isn't constant, it just comes and goes at any time. I am going to the doctors about it as soon as I can as I am fed up with all these joint problems, but can anyone give me a rough idea of what might be causing these problems? Just so you know, I am only 15 and do a healthy amount of exercise and eat healthily, although I never eat meat.     I will be greatful for any suggestions made :)   Thanks!
20090203092227AAljOWH	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	PLEASE HELP!!! My TSH or evaluation of thyroid function is suppressed. I am REALLY tired ALL THE TIME!! HELP?	I am a 20 years old college student, about to turn 21 and about two weeks ago I woke up and could not physically get out of bed. I thought nothing of it since it was 7am but then i tried to keep on getting up and I just couldn't! Finally when i did, around 12pm, I was EXTREMELY dizzy, had a huge headache, nauseous and was having a very hard time breathing. No one was around and i thought i was going to pass out.      I ended up going to the doctor after a couple of hours because i couldn't any sooner because i could not walk (i was so dizzy and weak). Before i left i took an iron pill and some multivitamins (i used to be partialy anemic), she tested my iron but said it was normal... Is it possible because i had just taken the pill? im not sure.      Finally when i got there, they ran some tests on me and these were my results (that my thyroid function was suppressed)...      FER                       40                       11-307 ng/mL       TSH                       0.25 Confirmed by repeat analysis L        0.34-5.60 uIU/mL       the nurse made me go in again and now she says i don't have anything, that i am normal... these were my results for the direct hormone testing...      Free T4, Automated        1.0                      0.8-1.6 ng/dL      Free T3, Automated        300                      249-405 pg/dL         she says it is normal and that we should check the TSH levels in 6 months. She did not say anything about what happened that day so i have no idea. I am tired all the time and even a flight of stairs makes me SUPER tired! I used to be VERY physically active, i am 140, 5'7, eat healthy and only 20! i don't think im depressed. its normal for me to feel this way... What can it be??

20090219173214AAMGluM	Health;Mental Health	Has anyone experienced anything similar?	I'm not too sure if this belongs in here or not.      A good friend and I have been drifting for quite some time now, mostly due to rl stuff with both of us, her more-so than me.    We used to talk a lot but more and more things have pushed me further away from her. The last time we spoke was a month ago.      Recently I mailed her to say hello and she seemed to want to pick up from where we left off almost immediately. I want things for us to go back the way they were before as well but now I'm feeling really held back and withdrawn from her. Just simple things like telling her about how I've been or what I've been doing with myself etc has been really tough.      I wouldn't say I was unhappy with the way things are, I am quite happy just to be talking to her still.   It's hard to explain exactly what the problem is but maybe I'm worried if I open myself back up to her she'll drift again.      I have had a lot of experiences lately with my feelings being stomped on.   Some drama with some other friends have definitely left some negative impressions in the way I view friendships and I fear its making me somewhat anti social. =\      I recently received a message on facebook from a best friend i had in school (friends for about 15 yrs) and I rejected it just because I didn't feel like I could be bothered with the whole thing. =[ (We haven't seen each other for 4+ yrs)       I actually feel quite happy, happiest I've been in years but this way I've been acting towards people worries me some what. I'm a nice person, I can see how people could think otherwise but I've gone through some changes lately that relate to all this and I think it's having a negative impact on me.  (my other questions are related to this as well)      I don't know whats going on with me, do you think I should be worried?      If none of this makes sense just ask questions and I'll try to answer them as best as I can.

I woke up at 12:00, nauseous, thew up at around 2:00, took some meds my dad (doctor) gave me, ate about 10 plain crackers and drank water. I took a nap from 5:00pm-10:45pm. I woke up with my nerves in my feet, hands and arms really sensitive, and a 101.2 fever. Dad gave me motrin, toast and tea and I felt better. Went back to bed, woke up at 11am this morning perfectly fine. Suddenly, like 2 hours ago, I started feeling REALLY cold! And I'm not sure why! I'm tired, but that's normal for me, and I'm just REALLY cold! All day, at home, I've been wearing my coat, long pants and a sweater, under a blanket in my formal living room, composing music. And then I suddenly couldn't take it anymore, and I said "Goodnight mom!" and here I am under my duvet, in my pants sweater and coat still freezing! I haven't been outside today (it's like 35 F outside) and my house temperature is at 70 - the way I like it. My my teeth are chattering! Why is this? And I ate today.  I had a soup and crackers when I woke up. What is wrong with me???? This is SO annoying. I used to be borderline anemic, but I should be fine now. What is wrong? AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! I feel like I'm having a seizure! I'm actually epileptic, and I've been taking my meds regularly, and haven't had a seizure in like 10 months.       What's wrong???

I got a positive TB test (the kind where they prick your forearm and diagnose by size and texture of the reaction).  I'm waiting on the chest x-ray, but a specialist speculated that I have the passive version that lingers in your body without causing any damage unless your immune system becomes severely compromised.  She recommended 9 months of antibiotics, which would get rid of the virus, but not prevent a recurrence.  She said there are side effects to the antibiotics, and a risk of liver damage.  I'm having a hard time getting information from actual doctors on the subject, but it's my understanding from what I read that a positive test is fairly common (mine was 10 millimeters...maybe slightly less) and it's often nothing to worry about.  Is it worth it to take the antibiotic?  Does anyone who's been through this have any real advice?  I'm feeling a little lost in the shuffle.

I'm asking b/c I have some muscle relaxers at home but not sure they would phase nerve pain.   Here's the deal.... I was lifting a pallet by using a pallet jack.  All of a sudden I felt this horrible squeeze all the way around (chest, sides, and back).  It was a VERY tight squeeze.  My first initial thought was that I'm having a heart attack.  The squeeze went away and I went to stand up straight.  When I did that, I realized I had pulled something in my back.  If I move the wrong way, it hurts like crazy.  Anyone ever experience a "squeeze" like this?  Thoughts on whether this is a nerve or muscle pain?        And, yes, I will see a doctor and/or chiropractor if it persists.  I'm just curious what I should take or do for the pain in the meantime.

What should I do for treatment and what could this be? Do I need to go into the doctor because I thought I should since I had strep before and this could be a relapse or something.

20090203094823AAChsaG	Health;Women's Health	Just about my health?	Hi, I dont really know what my question is, I'll just start from the start.      In december 07 I started to have problems down below like soreness during sex and I went to the doctors and I had bacterial vaginosis. So i was given the treatment - it cleared up and then I was ok       Then in Febuary 08 the exact same process happened again.      Then in April It happened again I went to the doctors as normal but when they got the results back there was nothing there.    So I was left confused and just thought I would wait a couple of weeks and see if it goes - which it didnt. So I went back again and had another test nothing still came back so they told me to go the the sexual health clinic and again I was still all clear, so i went back to the docs and i got refered to the gynocoloigist, So i waited intill august for that appointment and i was still sore ( there are no other symptons its just sore ) and he said that everything was fine and they gave me this cream and tablets to try and help the 'nerve endings'    So I started using them but things wernt getting better and eventually I stopped using them.   Now while all of this was still going on - I was having sex - because the pain would be as my boyfriend entered and at the start - but once i was enjoying it and really wet the pain would fade away - but then come back at the end when I was really sore - also it would always really hurt tp be after having sex. We also found using lube helped so much. So I was dealing with it but the pain was still there.   Then in october I found out i was pregnant.   Since then it has been so so so much worse!! I cant have sex at all its so sore all the time - even when I wipe after Ive been to the toliet it is sore just from that contact.   So I went to the doctors and Ive explained time and time again that something is wrong with me and its actually really affecting me now. I said how Its starting to make me feel down because I want to have sex but im starting to just generally feel scared about having sex. So she did another test down there and a wee test as well and I rang up and the results were all clear. Now no one has contacted me not the doctor who saw me and I feel like ive just been left. Im sick and tired of contiusely going back to the doctors and saying the same thing. I really want to have sex with my boyfriend and Its just too painful :(      So I dont really know what my question is but I just wanted to right it

20090219180806AAyhNaH	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	I had black streaks in stool?	Today while going to the bathroom I found black streaks in my stool. Some were spots, some were streaks. Otherwise, my stool was a normal color. They were sporadic and none were that long. I have been having an achy pain in my lower abdomen for almost three weeks now, and last weekend I had a thrombosis hemorrhoid develop which subsequently burst. It is still bleeding where it bled. Anyways, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts as to what it was. I am really worried about Colon cancer. A few other notes, I had a colonoscopy a year and a half ago (a little less than) and I am 24 years old. The colonoscopy showed that I had internal hemorrhoids which the doctor did not give me anything to treat. Also, this pain developed after a heavy night of drinking. What do you guys think? Also, what was the black streaks on my poo, blood?

I became a member of Golds gym last month and 2 days after I decided after my mom made me that i couldn't keep my membership. So within the 3 business days stated in my contract called them and told them my problem. They said i could come up to the gym fill out some paperwork and everything would be taken care of. I went up there filled it out signed it and they said everything was taken care of. Next month, February, I looked at my bank account and saw they took the monthly fee out. What can i do?
20090219175834AAq3wP6	Health;Dental	Why do I grind my teeth every night?	I have been doing this my whole life (since I was 5, I'm now 23). This literally is an every night thing. My bf tells me I do it every night, and my roomie can hear me in the next room. She says I sound like a saw. It kinda freaked her out at first. Why do I do this and how can I make it stop? I no longer get the sore jaw and headaches (or I'm so used to it I no loger notice) but I know how bad this is for me and I don't have the $ for a guard.

20090219175935AACfNGS	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Accutane question on pimples?	I am currently on Accutane. Day 17 i believe. So far just really dry skin and lips and also some red "marks" on my hands. And of course the really bad breakout the first month! Has to get worse before better I suppose.      My question is. I have a really bad habit of picking and popping my pimples because they are so bad at the moment. How much is this going to worsen my acne once it is cleared up my Accutane?      Will the popping just leave red marks? Or will I get scars from this?      I do not have SEVERE acne but it is pretty bad.      Thanks!
20090219175957AArlm9r	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Sprained or Broken Ankle? What do I do?	Ok, last Friday, I was leaving school, walking on the sidewalk. My friend called from behind me and I turned around and started walking backwards. I trip and my left ankle bends outward and touches the ground as I fall. At first, it was numb. My friend rushed over and helped me up. As I tried to walk on it, i would nearly fall because I couldn't put pressure on it. Maybe about a minute later, I started putting pressure and walking. Though walking, I was limping and it was hurting mainly in my ankle but also up my leg. The pain on my ankle was sharp. I walked for about an hour before I got home and started to take care of the situation. I elevated my foot and put ice on it to reduce the swelling for about 4 hours. After, I started walking on it. Although, I was walking sideways because it hurt too much to walk forwards. About a day later, the swelling seemed to have gone down a fair amount and I was walking on it with a minor limp. I noticed that nearly every time I took a step, my ankle would crack. Its nearly a week later and there is now a bruise that has spread down the outer part of my ankle to my heal and a thin strip around the side of my foot up on the base of my toes. The bruise goes up to my big toe but doesn't actually touch it. I notice now that the bruise is going down my middle toe. My ankle has had slight pain and I walk on it a fairly large amount of time during the day. I don't have insurance and I don't have much money. I don't want to regret going to the doctors to pay for an x-ray just to figure out that it's a sprain. Although, I also don't want to regret not going to the doctor and figuring out that it in fact was a break. Any suggestions on what I can do?

The doctors say they caught it earlier (stage 1) They are going to do a hysterectomy. She is only 41 years old. I am so scared. She goes for surgery on the 9th. Has any been through this or know anyone who has. Any information you can give me would be great. I was reading online and it said at stage one thereisa 75%- 95% of survival but that still is a scary number.

20090203094654AAnVraW	Health;Dental	Question about teeth?	I have a tooth in the very back, right side that has been falling apart piece by piece. It has been going on for a little over a year now. What is left is a shallow outline of tooth with a huge hole in the middle. This isn't the first time this has happened. I had a tooth and roots removed for the same problem about 6 years ago. It has been causing me a lot of pain, and I am at my end as to what to do about it.   We have no insurance, and are not rich, or I would have already been to the dentist..   By the way, Both my Mother and Grand-mother had to have all their teeth removed in their late 20's due to gum disease. Maybe it might be genetic?
