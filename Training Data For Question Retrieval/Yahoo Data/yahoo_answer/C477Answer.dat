v3xEtuLLaa	Are you going to do it or are you going to have it done?  Drywall costs around $6-8 for a 4' x 8' x 1/2" sheet.  Mud and tape will cost around $15.  If you are having it done, figure a minimum of $200 for labor, due to the fact that 3 coats of mud are required with sufficient drying time between coats.  Hope this helps.

fCF02V87aa	This is all about what you like---I like my trim to stand out a bit--and use glossy white Enamel most times. If you are going to replace the trim--or are willing to put some elbow grease into a stripping job--consider staining it to match your cabinets. There is no right or wrong--if you like the look---go for it.|`|v3xEtuLLaa	White trim looks good with any color scheme.  You don't have to match the trim to the cabinets.  If you plan to paint a neutral color, though, I would recommend a darker tan or brown, at least on one wall.  Too much light coloring can look kind of bland.  Hope this helps.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	You will need to clean all the wood trim with TSP and then prime with a water-based primer. Paint with an enamel trim paint. White will be good for the trim!Consider painting the walls a silvery blue grey color to compliment your stainless steel appliances.  Play with color here:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/  I thought silvermist looked good for the walls.
WEPzHNmLaa	You will pay less but not as little as you quote|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	not only will the price be a bit lower, you might not have to wait as long and there is a good chance that the people doing the will be more competent than what you would have had to put up with a year or so ago.  I think (hope) all the marginal companies and contractors have been put right out of business and only the good ones are left.|`|Gd4f7VD1aa	You need to get several estimates.  Explain everything that you want and have it bidded out.  do not guess.

mP0LLMVjaa	I would paint the headboard wall the darker orange color and the other walls the lighter yellow. Take a pillow case with you to Home Depot or Lowes and they can match the colors for you. If you use a small sponge roller,paint pad and foam brush you can get by with 1 quart of the orange. Place the pad,roller and brush in a plastic bag in the fridge until ready for second coat and use one of those small paint trays. Get a gallon of the yellow color and some painter's tape to tape off the edges of the wall. The paint pad works great for painting the edge along the ceiling.  Here's a site where you can play around with the colors:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/  Use brown frames and maybe a red lampshade or lamp.|`|GQEINgM4aa	Kind of hard, because there are alot of colors.

Basically, pick a colour from the sheets and work with it.|`|vznExYGbaa	That is a very pretty pattern.    I would say pics a color in that bedroom set.  Orange and yellow would be too much.

But If you are more expressive of your feelings you may try a light mint green color... Would be like the grass for all of your flowers..|`|2yiPCZlJaa	I would say either orange or yellow. The orange would look good with the brown sheets. Basically, any of the colors in the duvet would work, though.
8tdlP1rOaa	well, obviously white and black paint.   it will take a while.   painting ceilings are always the worst, so to put a design on it is even worse.  I'd start by painting the ceiling all white and let it dry.   you may want to try using some sort of stencil for the black part and then stay in the lines!|`|C7SAdyC2aa	first you need a very wealthy sister to call a qualified specialty finish painter "faux painter" and the cost will be around 50 dollars an hour plus materials I would paint it in about 32 hours at a cost of 1600 dollars plus paint so about 1850$|`|rAa8bfhwaa	Kill a Zebra and stick it to the ceiling via super glue|`|8uNXjNknaa	It would take awhile to do, but you need a nice smooth new paint brush.

Or...  you could be really daring, have all walls white apart from the bed wall which could be different colour stripes matchin yr comforters, lol.|`|8to6MsWuaa	I think a mix in between white and creme or beige would look good. Or if you did plaine white, you could have accents in you room that would match your bed spreads.|`|qiKPk5fTaa	I think that an off-white wall would be a great color. It would make the bed the highlight of the room with the color.

75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	i think for the first year, maybe 2, you should concentrate on making sure the root system takes.  once that happens, then you probably should look up what mineral content promotes fruit.     if you've gone to the trouble to buy them, then make sure they don't die.  promoting root growth is probably the best thing you can do in that respect.  once you know the roots will stand the strain of fruiting, them -- uh ---  hey, invite me over, and we'll make pie.  ;-)|`|DXh2BlCraa	Plant them in the spring. Blueberries grow best is full sun. They need acidic soils with a pH of 4.0 to 4.5. They like clay and other poor or rocky soils. You may need to increase the acidity in your soil to grow healthy bushes. Space blueberry bushes about five to six feet apart. We recommend rows eight to ten feet apart. They will tolerate a little crowding. Mix in healthy amounts of compost and other organic matter. Keep a thick layer of mulch around your blueberry bushes to eliminate weeds, and help keep the soil moist. Water well after planting and in the first few weeks as necessary to promote good root growth. A new bush will produce in three years.    Add fertilizer once in the spring and again in late summer. The latter application will help to promote buds for next year.    Raspberries will grow in poor, dry soils. They will successfully compete against weeds in the woods. But, in the wild, the berries can be small, and the crop sparse. Given a little attention and care, they will do much better in your garden.|`|EeFLajXxaa	I am assuming these are cross pollinating.    The number one thing to do is space them 3' apart, they will grow and they need air.  If you are going to plant them in an area where there is grass or weeds, clear it out.     Make sure the hole you dig is no deeper than the top of the pot they come in.  Use plenty of  peat moss and good dirt.  Water thoroughly and put a good mulch down such as pine needles.   You can put landscape fabric down but don't put it right next to the plant.  If you don't use landscape fabric keep the grass and weeds out by pulling them up.  After they get started just make sure they have enough water in the hot summer months.  When they start to fruit, you may want to put netting over them, the birds love them.  Fertilize around them in the fall.
mqUaiNeUaa	Sounds like you have a partial blockage of the pipe just past the p-traps.  It does not sound like you did anything wrong.  It backs up because it can't flow fast enough down the drain.

Check and make sure you don't have any clogs or blockage in the common drain pipe.  Sometimes spackle or paint can get dropped in a drain during a remodel and cause problems.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	It's possible that you have your drain pipes running too level, allowing it to drain across instead of down.    If you only had one P trap,like a kitchen sink does, that would allow the drain on one sink to vent through the other sink and drain a lot faster.

iZ4JugiAaa	Herbs would grow now, if you water them enough.  If you should get a cold snap, throw a piece of fabric over the plants, held down at the edges so the wind won't blow it away.  I bought felt remnants when I lived in Clearwater, and they do a great job.  |`|pflsOfa7aa	now is the best time to plant herbs. before you plant them try placing the around in different places in your yard (While still in the pots). If the plant likes where you put it plant it there. How much sun a plant gets has a lot to do with how well the plant does. By doing this you'll save yourself a lot of trouble  after they are planted. btw full sun is not as  good as people think. P.S. if you know your getting a cold snap water your plants in late afternoon. Believe it or not your plants will have a better chance of survival in wet dirt. Wet dirt keeps the roots warm. Good Luck!
b9a25e0d3e644235a89b321fd895e151aa	I am not sure but you can compare this yourself by painting some paper of the color you are using and then cutting it to shape to be placed over the big ends and small ends (just make sure to do this outside where you wont paint anything).|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	Depends on what you are going for.  If you paint a darker color on the ends that are farther apart you will give the illusion of shortening the room.  Lighter color will lengthen it. 
qNVP4Q1Saa	The piping in a domestic forced hot water system is designed to operate at around 15 psi.  The copper pipes will hold 60 psi with no problem. You need a fairly decent flow of air to blow the water out successfully.  The CFM is what you need, in other words volume. that said one of those small air compressors will absolutely not work. A small pancake compressor will work if you allow the tank to fill up and then release the air into the system to to blow the water out. The pump itself takes a while to compress the air and then relase that volume to blow the water out.  As you suggest, drain as much water as possible, then use the compressor. If you are going to rent a compressor you will be best served to rent a gas powered compressor as they have a quick recovery high cfm rating. Keep in mind you do not need to blow all the water out but you must get it out of any low lying pipes or elbows.  I once blew a house out that had a section of pipe that could not be evacuated. I could blow the section out, but water would gravity feed back to that area. I cut that pipes lowest point and installed a spigot. that may not happen to you, but keep it in mind. When you apply an air source to the system make sure to set teh regulator to 70psi max. if the pressure is allowed to build to 120psi which is teh normal high shutoff, it may blow a line or worse, effect teh boiler or its hardware.  After the system is drained it is a good idea to set the pressure in the expansion tank to 12psi while you still have teh compressor in the area.|`|944iJNAdaa	You could do this job with just 10 or 20 pounds of pressure, if that's all you had.  If you drain your waterheater first, the amount of cubic inches of pipe space has to be trivial.  I think just about any air compressor you get will work here, as long as it's not one of those little battery operated ones for cars, and that might even work, if you had a good connection and were patient.|`|xvNujuWiaa	All the answers are OK.  In fact you don't need to get all the water out,  you just need to have more air or space so the water in the pipes can expand.  This is what causes the pipes to burst.  You could also try a wet-dry vacuum and suck all the water out.  As said before drain the water heater first and then go outside and shut off the main open all the the valves in the house hot and cold go outside and use the wet vac at the hose connection... This should also work.<br>

cc23d32f69850bf615debc95e57a7cc1aa	If you've planted regular bulb onions, just wait for the tops to turn tan/brown and they'll eventually fall over on their own.  When you begin to see this happening, stop watering.  Wait a couple of weeks and then yank them out OR dig them out of the ground.      I usually just leave them out in the sun to dry until the tops dry out completely.  Separate the dried-up tops from the onions and store them in a dry place (such as your garage)  where they can be receive good ventilation. You don't want to store them in a plastic bag.  I purchased a vented laundry basket to keep the onions dry and prevent them from rotting.       GOOD LUCK!|`|AA12121778	To maximize yield and quality, onions should be harvested only when mature. The bulbing phase is often very rapid and occurs near the end of the onion's active growth period. During this time, the onion tops will begin to fall over and die. Onions should be ready to harvest when approximately 10 to 20 percent of the tops have fallen over. Harvesting begins with a shallow undercutting 1 to 2 inches below the bulbs. Undercutting initiates and hastens the onion's change from growth to dormancy. The practice of clipping the tops with a rotary mower just before harvest is not recommended in North Carolina because it increases the risk of disease|`|04d14f976200fa76417b4525408120dbaa	your stems or chives will be large and thick. about an inch or two in diameter. The base of the onion will begin to pertrude from the ground. If your stem begins to form buds on the tips you need to pull them up unless you want them to go to seed. the Onion itself is very tough after it goes to seed.
5SheAUP6aa	Gas water heaters have a 12-15 year life span. If it's that old, then shop for a new one. Don't dump money in to the old one. If it is newer, then check the fittings to see if that is where the leak is coming from. Especially check the blow-off valve usually located on the side of the water heater. If you do decide to replace the water heater, purchase one that has a fiberglass tank. They last much longer. Hope this helps.|`|Jnz0izhAaa	It's old and has a small hole in it.<br>  Water heaters don't last forever<br>  If it's in the tank there is no repairing it, time to buy a new one|`|NvXbH88raa	Probably small hole in tank.<br>  Have a plumber check it out
6d63837f204da2a235cf0bb4afce32aeaa	Cedar waxwings eat a large variety of fruits, berries, and insects and will not likely be attracted to seed feeders.  If you are seeing the cedar waxwings around your pond, they are likely feeding on the insects that live near there. There are meal worm and fruit feeders available at specialty stores (Wild Birds Unlimited, Wild Birds Forever), or you can landscape closer to your house to offer berries/fruits that may attract the birds.  Plants such as viburnum (berries) and persimmon (fruit tree) will attract the birds when the fruits are in season.  A flock of cedar waxwings can strip a mature persimmon tree of fruit in a few hours.    Different species of birds have different feeding habits.  If you want to create a feeding area for the waxwings, set the feeders up at least 10 ft away from your seed feeder.|`|AA12121778	You need a fruit feeder or platform feeder.

Otherwise, politicians wouldn't have make-up artists and hairstylists  traveling with them on the campaign trails. They also have wardrobe consultants working with them on how to dress, down to which shirts would go well with which ties.    Experts now believe the main reason Nixon lost his bid for President in 1960 against Kennedy was due to how he looked on TV during the presidential debate. A test showed the majority of those who listened to the debate without having the picture to look at (audio recording only) , rated Nixon as the debate winner. On the contrary, those who watched the debate on TV (or video recording) mostly rated Kennedy as the debate winner. Looks did make a difference indeed!

You can get plugs to fit at most electrical dealers (MK number is 502)|`|226e3a2fab88d7504df2daf62783c07aaa	it all depends...where do you live? what country?|`|3226cfbd50333c6fec4eb131e56eb7f9aa	If you are in the UK the sockets are for an old 15 amp system, rather than the current 13 amp system that we use now.   If you have rented your property this system is ILLEGAL as it does not comply with current electrical standards - report it to your rental agent or to Trading Standards. If you have purchased your property, then you need a re-wire. You cannot buy 15 amp plugs in the UK.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	if you live in us or canada you should really have an electrician come in and look at your wiring. it could be old have might be a big fire hazard. also, it might not fit the building code and if you do have a fire you would then have to pay a big fine, and would nt be insured.

Sin embargo, cuando no hay otra opcin por cuestiones de espacio, la distancia mnima debe ser de 50 cms, sin que interfiera la apertura de la ventana con la tubera. La tubera (metlica siempre en estos casos) deber ir bien adosada (pegada) en el exterior del muro con abrazaderas y alejada tambin 50 cms de cableado de cualquier tipo o de cualquier fuente de calor (boiler). Nunca deber instalarse ahogada dentro de la pared.  La cercana con la ventana no implica mayores riesgos, siempre y cuando se sigan estas indicaciones de instalacin.

AA10139925	In order to repaint it you will have to definitely sand it off, the coating of the polyurethane will come off with some heavy sanding. That will prepare the surface to repaint the furniture.  But because paint has a huge tendency to scratch on things that get heavy use, then you might want to put a few coats of polyurethane back over the paint you put on.  That way it will protect the new paint job.  You don't have to but it sure helps for little marks and nicks the piece might get with use. Another handy tip is if it's a table or desk piece, put a big piece of glass on the top to protect the surface and if it's a chair do put the polyurethane on that.  If it's a headboard, you probably could get away from putting the poly. back on.  Also don't forget to wear a mask when sanding that stuff off...have fun!|`|ElBaODCCaa	You will have to take off the poly with a liquid de glosser or a liquid sanding solution before you paint. Or you can try an oil based primer and see if it adheres to this glossy finish, then paint. I would personally be wary of that.  You need to have something for the primer and or paint to adhere to, otherwise it will scratch right off.  After you de gloss, you can paint,  and yes I would put a coat of poly over it when finished. Poly's come in many finishes from satin to ultrra glossy|`|5TOp9HhHaa	Yes. If you paint over the unscratchable coating, the furniture will no longer be protected.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Why do you want to paint it????? If painting another color then lightly sand the poly and use an oil-based primer over it. You can have the primer tinted to your paint color. Paint with a good enamel paint and let dry between coats.|`|wNoyyz7Saa	no|`|yrQQ3dJVaa	probably.|`|WAGpAh8oaa	i would sand the polyurethane off, prime it then paint then put a new coat of polyurethane on|`|XjgQ3jDZaa	Not really.  I repainted a cabinet that had fake wood.  I used "liquid sander" first.  That stuff is great!  It made the paint adhere just as it would have if I would have put all the work into actually sanding it.  That is the route I would take.|`|qSSi2fcSaa	Yes otherwise they new paint might scratch off.|`|Ss7nVdr2aa	yes..once you repaint it then the old Polyurethane in now under the new paint and does no good. It's supposed to be used a "top coat" so yes it should be applied again.

8a25c528ed963e10d471905e4e6f9eb9aa	Try unbottoning your pants when you sit down.  I guess its best to do that when you're at home or somewhere you're comfortable.  That way the butt and waist part doesn't get so loose.  Also, starch might help.  Try using that when you're washing/drying your jeans.  Hope that helps.|`|b6f230f54f67b22cbe07843096af3e2aaa	You can't, that's why they're stretch jeans.  What you can do is "shrink them," so that they'll be tight at first and then stretch out to fit better.  Wash them in hot water & dry in high heat.  Now, for future purchases, first thing you need to look for is the amoutn of lycrz in them, that'll determine how much they'll give after being worn.  1% spandex will usually give you a good fit w/o stretching to a whole other size.  From personal experience, pants w/ 2%  after worn for a couple of hours will stretch out way too much.  What you can also do is buy them a size smaller, so that when they stretch they'll fit just right.  (Although I don't suggest this if the smaller size will completely cut off your circulation; only go smaller if they're just a little tight but still breathable).  Another option, would be to buy jeans that are 100% cotton; they take longer to "conform" to your body but once they do, they'll fit like a glove.  Hope this helps...GOOD LUCK!|`|8bf0928e315e6171fe3791d1c6b3a4b7aa	if you wash them and then put them in the dryer, they should go back to it's form or they're too cheap of material|`|6e34f1c3efbd3d63fb5b79e4334e8388aa	My favorite jeans did this too. I ended up throwing them out. They looked great when I put them on but after a few hours, they looked so horrible. I couldn't take it anymore and gave them the deep six. They were Levi's too. It was just that one pair of pants. I bought another pair of pants (Levis), this time the material was thicker and I have no problems with them. Don't buy jeans that have thin stretchy material. They are garbage, even if they look cool when you try them.|`|43baa2d260cb68c6cbf5bc2c9d085b4aaa	you need more junk in the trunk to keep them up.

c64d5e5c9d97057fb12e7e6689cb3ae2aa	do not wash them in the washing machine if you want to keep your runners in good condition, I recommend you wash them by hand or if available use a dishwasher, loosen laces and place on the top shelve & air dry only.|`|AA12050379	Dont forget to run a cycle of bleach or vinegar after you wash the sneakers in the dishwasher (to sanitize it).

ba73af7c9c639822202932e0a36f86faaa	Start by cleaning it!  ok, it's not really as hard as it seems if you get the right tools.  There is a liquid paint that you can buy that will seal all the cracks in your walls and floor so you'll need to make sure you dont have any cracks or your carpet will get ruined.  Then you will need to get some insulation for your walls, and you can also buy plywood or some other form of prefabricated wall.  make sure that you do not put this new wall right up against your basement wall, which is probably brick.  you want to leave a space between the two walls for moisture, otherwise you could have a mold issue later on.  After you get your cracks sealed and your insulation, plywood ready, its just the easy task of putting it up and laying your carpet correctly, which isn't too hard.  You will get a lot of small problems here about measurments and stuff, but nothing you cant finish with the correct tools, like a carpet cutter.  After that, all you need is a roof.  As long as none of your pipes leak, you can just put a drop down ceiling with tiles there and it should be fine.|`|898e59a7ef40359a94121e944e279e6faa	make sure there is no water/moisture getting into the basement.  If there is, find out where it is coming from.  You may need to grade the soil around the house so it slopes away from the house.  Then clean out the basement and decide how you want to design it (make drawings with exact measurements).  You may also want to install some soundproofing in the ceiling while you have it exposed.    Then decide where you want the electric and plumbing to go- plumbing for the baseboard heat if you plan on having heat and you have a baseboard system.   You probably have 7 foot ceilings so I would suggest recessed lighting.    frame out the walls with 2x4s go right otop of the concete walls(so that you can hide the plumbing and wiring behind it).  Then run all your plumbing and electric.  make sure you leave any electrical connections accessible.  Install drywall, spackle, install floor... paint.|`|AA11957106	First, first, FIRST make sure it is dry year round!!!!!!!!!!  The next step must be a plan.  2-Usually, firring out the walls. Applying thin (firring strips) to the walls so you have something to nail the wall covering to. You might want to use a thicker strip if you intend to run wiring and boxes in the wall.  Firring is applied with concrete nails or SHOT on with a Powder Actuated Fastener ( lots of fun)|`|55a192407b9799e137beab115b0b93f2aa	I don't intend for this to be sarcastic, my apologies, but clean it out. Get a dumpster and a portable storage container to use if needed. Everything that is not mandatory (water heater, washer and dryer, furnace) has to go out.    Don't do it half way. Scrub the entire basement to guarantee any mold, dust, bugs, mice and whatever is gone.    Secure cheap rug to the stairs (anything from a yard sale will do at this stage) You want it to pick up dirt from your work boots. Toss it in favor of new pretty carpet when the work is finished.    Seal the stone or brick walls and floors with a quality water barrier product.    After that... it's up to you. It could be a bedroom, work room or anything you like.

9ee31f6ad55abff4de3f8f5aaae5508daa	That depends on the kind of plant you have and where you plan on showing it off at.    If your sunshine shoots straight through the window then I would advise that you do not place plants right next to the window regardless what type of a plant it is, the reason is that plants can get roasted even cactus if left right next to a glass window with the curtains wide open, the glass acts like a magnifier on plants, the best way to keep your plant from getting a terrible case of sunburn is to keep the plants out of direct sunlight or to filter out the sun rays.    Again depending on the kind of plant you have some plants detest even a brightly lit room while others needs this bright light.    There is no harm at placing your plant in your living room area or any other place for that matter except for cactus, cactus and succulents will most certainly rot to death if place into the bathroom.|`|485f44bea3150cb5f39cbfabb912b496aa	sure, its a great idea.

In the end, you'll have lovely, satiny roses that will make an eye-catching presentation. You can also use these roses to decorate cakes, party trays, or table settings. Half of the fun is imagining the possibilities.     Supplies:     Roseswe had better results with roses that weren't too tightly closed, but feel free to experiment   Saucepan and coffee can OR double boiler   Paraffin waxin the summer this is available in your grocer's canning aisle   Candy thermometer (optional)   Toothpicks or bamboo skewers (check the cooking supplies aisle)   Spoon   Newspaper or brown paper bags   Waxed or parchment paper to dry the flowers   Floral wire (optional)*   Floral tape (optional)*   Plastic scraper for cleanup (optional)   Chill flowers in refrigerator for one hour. (This step is optional. It seemed to make the darker colored blooms wax more nicely, but the leaves of the chilled roses waxed better after they had warmed a bit. You could wax all the tops, and then wax the leaves and stems, allowing time for them to warm.)   Add water to bottom of double boiler or pot. Cut paraffin wax into blocks and place in top of double boiler or coffee can. You'll need enough wax to fully immerse the flower head. The amount of paraffin to use will depend on the size of the coffee can or double boiler. We used one pound of wax in a coffee can. Heat on low heat until wax melts. Handle pots and hot wax with care.   Protect work surface with newspaper or brown paper bags.   When wax is heated until clear, dip the entire head of the rose into the wax to coat. When the wax is melted fully, it was about 140o on the candy thermometer, so monitoring the temperature seems unnecessary.   Spoon wax over the head of the flower to make sure all petals are being coated. Also spoon wax over the stem and leaves, being sure to seal the stem bottom. While the wax is still soft, use the toothpick to separate the petals and leaves, if needed.   Dry on waxed or parchment paper.   Repeat process with remaining flowers. Reheat wax and add more, as needed.    *Alternate treatment for stems: If you prefer, you can remove the leaves and insert the floral wire into the head of the rose and the length of the stem; then wrap the entire stem with floral tape. Then wax only the head of the flower.   One Home Made Simple team member suggested immersing the just-dipped roses into ice water. We thought it created an interesting look, but it wasn't necessary. Try it to see what you think.     This process works with other flowers as well. Try it with tulips, daisies, daylilies, and other firm flowers. We also waxed baby's breath. The wax made it too heavy and droopy, but it was an interesting effect. We waxed the greenery, and it looked great. Have fun experimenting.|`|2UsaC1AWaa	yea...buy plastic ones

If it has a bag, it should never be more than 1/2 full as suction is compromised after that point.  Bag-less should be emptied after every use.    If your sweeper is older, it might be time for a new one.  Gaskets and parts degenerate quickly because of the heat a sweeper generates and the abrasive nature of dirt.  If your sweeper is over about 5 years old and wasn't a quality unit in the first place, replace it.    Look for HEPA filtration when you shop for a new sweeper.  That extra step filters out the dirt in the exhaust.  And keep the filters clean also.  Sweeper tech has changed greatly in the last few years and there is an efficient model for nearly every budget.    I have a lot of pets so we're rough on sweepers.  I bought a Bissell Healthy Home before the holidays and I am very pleased with it.  It has the multi-cyclonic technology that is found in a lot of the higher cost sweepers but the unit is less expensive.  5 year warranty and a lifetime belt, good on board tools and easy to use.|`|0qpf53GCaa	A good vacuum is the best bet against dust. If you don't have a high end vac then you are actually putting more dust in the air then there was before you started vacuuming.    Bagless vacuums have horrible filtration because the cyclonic desings just don't work compared to a bagged machine..even if it has a HEPA filter.     If you get a good vacuum you can be sure that all the dust you vacuum up will stay there. A good vacuum will bring the air particles per cubic meter down to zero. Only a few brands can do that. Look for Sebo, Miele, Riccar, Simplicity, Lindhaus etc|`|KUiisECjaa	Make sure you replace your furnace filters regularly, and buy good ones. The cheap ones don't stop any dust. There's not much else you can do other than replacing carpeted floors with hardwood or laminate. It seems worse in the winter, probably since we are inside more , wearing more clothes, walking on the carpet, all this action breaks down the fabric fibres releasing more dust. So get out the vacuum, and the pledge and keep on dusting!!
K5IOSGXAaa	It depends on if you like everything coordinated and matching. I wouldn't like the mix myself but everyone has their own taste.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I think it'll look fine.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	I would get it to match the dresser or get a cherry dresser.
y31mee4Faa	Don't know of any metal ones...they would be too hot for birds to nest in & would probably kill the chicks because they could not get away from the heat during the day.      Good luck...|`|pfagIGNSaa	Try this  http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&...
t0MiDBMEaa	Check out Crate and Barrel.  www.crateandbarrel.com  They have lots of pillows in solids, stripes, floral and so on.  I think blue and brown goes beautifully together with white accents.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Get some pillows with alot of color in them that have the blue in the walls. Get a couple of darker blue throws for the sofa. Get some prints for the wall with blue in them:  http://www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?st...  http://www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?st...  Just make sure you order posters that you can get poster frames for like at Walmart. I know they carry the 24" x 36" size and some smaller ones. Check the sizes of frames available before ordering posters. I have been very happy with the posters from all posters. Walmart probably has the pillows and throws also.|`|Run7dyraaa	lots of brown accessories, even burnt orange|`|bKwQyCEHaa	Uh idk tan black|`|MIlpLLZcaa	Chocolate browns, pinks even purples go quite well with pale blue, for a neutral effect a pewter or graphite grey would be clean and modern, try to stay away from black, can be a little to harsh with such a cool colour.  Have Fun and Good Luck!|`|f0NFwXxwaa	Hi,      Sounds like you need warm colors in there my friend, you know like deep reds, bronze to yellows or anything that makes you feel warm and cozy.     I agree dark browns will work but everyone and their dog has got browns these days so just think of what makes you feel warm and then visualize coming home to it in your minds eye.    Good luck|`|3uRie2GAaa	brown coach with baby blue and beige pillows would be great thats how i see it and the pictures umm with dark brown frames
wKQbNvm9aa	Here is a cute thing people make from light bulbs:  http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthre...
AKrTZqbKaa	First of all a potato is considered a tuber or root crop.To start one you must have a potato with eyes on them as these are actually the seed for a new potato. Cut off the eyes with a little potato attached and let it dry out for a couple of days to prevent the seed from rotting. I usually dampen the seed cutting and dip it into rooting hormone to help it along. You don't have to but it helps in getting the roots started with less rot to the seedlings. Depending on the temperature outside you can start some in peat pots until planting time. Don't over water but just enough to keep them moist while growing indoors. I grew some potatoes one year using old spare tires. I placed one tire on the ground and planted a few potato plants. As the plants grew I added another tire and some more soil/compost to cover the plants. I added a few more tires and at harvest time I removed the tires and out fell about 10 lbs of potatoes. Didn't have to dig them up as they grew inside the old tires.|`|7wQGpG9Zaa	Put one or more potatoes in warm, moist spot for some for some days or weeks until you see the "eyes" starting to grow.  Wait a few more days or a week or two.  Cut the eyes off the potato.  Leave some potato on all sides and under the eye.  Place the eyes in potting soil, pot or tray.  Give lots of sun and keep moist but not wet.
y31mee4Faa	It's chiffarobe or armoir.      Good luck...|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Since there is no photo, I am going to guess that you are referring to a coat rack.
82GutKAtaa	My bathroom walls were wallpapered, but when my kids lived at home they sprayed hairspray, cologne, etc. accidentally on them.  I always had those little mist "dots" from them and could never get them off.  Until you figure out how to get it off, can you rearrange your bedroom and place something in front of it?  I can't believe I just said that, but your friend should fess up to your parents ....then give him the paintbrush and paint to redo the wall!!|`|AA11785060	Try hairspray-- it will take off most things-- a cheap brand of course.  I used it to take crayon off a wall.  Just test a small area though.  Rubbing alcohol might also work, again test an area before going for the whole area.  Before doing anything though, try plain old hot water.  Many paints are scrubbable, which means you can wash the wall so the spray may just wash off with warm soapy water.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	if you cant think of anything else, use a wet towel. its ok to get your walls wet with water|`|4rYDpMAgaa	Hello    Some bodysprays are oil based - sorry not much can be done quickly with oil based stains.    If they are oil based or contain fragrant oils, you will have to wash the areas with Varsol or Thinners. Do not do this in the winter or when the heating is on. Both Varsol and Thinners are very volatile.    This should be done in the warm weather with your windows open in more than one room so you get a cross draft. do not switch any electrical equipment on or off or have any open flames (pilot lights, gas/propane appliances, etc) while using Varsol or Thinners.    After cleaning the areas, let dry and air out for a few hours. Sand and prime the whole wall(s) - gives more even finish when done. Best to paint all walls of room.    If you do not paint, the stains will still show.    Read the instructions on selected Primer and finish coat paint.|`|gWfUBn2oaa	I'm not exactly sure what axe bodyspray is, but I've found the most effective cleanser for almost any kind of job is a product called GOOF OFF. It comes in capped liquid bottles and also in spray bottles (the kind I find most useful).  It'll remove almost anything including grease and oil based paint and even dried-on graffitti.  I don't recommend using it on plastic.  It's available at Home Depot, WalMart, Target & many other department stores.  Test it first on a small, non-obtrusive area.  Recommend you refer to your friend as a "former friend".
72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	My tried and true for removing inks from fabrics, is using a cheap hairspray and spritz it on with a WHITE cloth in back of the stain.  You should see the stain practically start dissolving right before your eyes.  Now take another white cloth and start blotting as much of the ink out of the fabric.  Any ink left?  Spray some more hairspray, and keep blotting while its wet.  After removing as much as you can this way, spritz with Shout and launder.  After washing, check the spot.  If it is all gone, dry as usual.  If not, let AIR DRY and go it it again.  Do not heat dry until the stain is gone, or you might set it.  Although, I have used this method on old ink stains and it worked beautifully!  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|J3fFR3Wuaa	try a Mr Clean Magic eraser|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	First of all you never stated as to what kind of fabric you are talking about. A piece of clothing or the fabric that is on a sofa. For clothing--Try spraying the stain with "SHOUT" stain remover.  Rub it in then let it set for a while. Toss in the washer in cold water so you do not set the stain. (Hot water will set a stain) Then air dry.  DO NOT DRY IN THE DRYER. Heat from the dryer will set the stain. Now if it is for furniture fabric you can still spray shout on it and scrub it in then rinse it out and that may take it out. Mr. Clean or Murphy's oil will only make your problem worse.  You do not use those on fabrics you will end up with an oil mark and a dry eraser mark stain.|`|jVeEfJnkaa	Murphys oil soap.
