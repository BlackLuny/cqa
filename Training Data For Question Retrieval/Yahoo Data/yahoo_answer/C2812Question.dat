20090222171931AAXwcXI	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Why did they change the Cheese Toast in Sizzler?	Before in Sizzler, they would serve cheese toast in a basket once you get in your table, and it would be about 4 pieces. Also before, the Cheese Toast was smaller, they used to use like thick bread, which is the same size as bread you would normally buy. Now the cheese toast is in a bigger bread, but now, they don't serve it to you in a basket with 4 pieces, instead now they just put one piece in the entree plate you order, and you get it when you get your entree. How come they did this now, they limit the cheese toast now, and how come they made it bigger, and don't give out a basket of cheese toast when you get to your table? Does anyone recognize this change, that the cheese toast got bigger, but they don't give you it in a basket with 4, instead they just give one to you in your entree plate? Also what if you don't order an entree, you just order the endless salad bar, will they still give you cheese toast? Why did they do this?

I am planning a birthday party for this weekend and was thinking of either Le Souk or Le Caire.       A couple questions:      Do you have to be 21 to get into either of these places?      Would guests *have* to pay more than 50$ for food, moderate drinking, and hookah?       How many people can share one hookah? Less than five or four?       Hate to sound so money conscious but I don't want to dump a big bill on guests (it's not their birthday after all).       Any suggestions or comments about either of these places??   Thanks so much for your help

I was wondering if it gets to be a pain to make sandwiches all day, or if it's really not too bad.       Do you get a free sub the day you work?      I'm going to my 2nd interview tomorrow. Over the phone, scheduling it, the manager told me to bring 2 forms of ID and talked about where I would be trained, and that I would go to a new Subway just opening up. Is the second interview more of paperwork and stuff? He made it sound like I already had the job, but still called it an interview. Anyone know about that???
