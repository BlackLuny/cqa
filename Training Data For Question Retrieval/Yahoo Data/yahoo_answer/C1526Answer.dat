You'd want to remove the hair sections from the wig cap base, then sew them onto whatever clothes you'll be wearing (probably a cape or caftan to match the color of the hair).

Schliemann excavated part of Troy, after an English consul found it.  Jewels were found. But later it was found that another layer of the town was more likely to have been the actual Troy of the Iliad, according to the story.  Archaeology also found that descriptions of the armour and buildings were realistic.  As for the gods, who can say that they were not, and are not real? The  whole point of a god is to inspire belief, and sometimes obedience, not to find any proof of god's existance.|`|a4a93d1728dc420a1fac5f2537cc444faa	It is not definitively established. There is a site at Hisarlik, Turkey that is the site of Roman-era Troy (from ~44 BCE onward), which was believed at the time to also be the site of ancient Troy. It has been excavated and there is significant support for it being ancient Troy, but it isn't conclusive yet. <br>  <br>  Hence it hasn't been conclusively established that the Trojan War (~1200 BCE) actually occured. The ruins appear to fit parts of the story, but don't match entirely. <br>  <br>  Up until the last century, it was commonly believed that the Trojan War was entirely mythological. However, largely because of the discoveries at Hisarlik, many archologists and historians now believe that the Trojan War was a real event, although the events in the Illiad are largely fictional. Some think that the story actually is a composite of several different Bronze Age conflicts, while others believe that it was one event and it occured at the site of Hisarlik.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that it was a real event and that Hisarlik was where it happened, and the stories just don't match because a lot was made up and modified from the real events.|`|UztWwcKqaa	it depends on what you believe in, some people will answer this question no, and some will answer yes. it all depends on what you believe in because it also has to do with your religion. i am Christian and i don't believe it was real, but some Christians might. so whatever you believe in is right|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	i believe its true, they even found the city of troy,i do not remember the name of the show i was watching, but they showed the ground where it is, very interesting. that's all i remember|`|8wjkHuOsaa	yup..<br>  because of trojan horse..<br>  now the trojan horse became very smaller..<br>  and very abstract...<br>  *virus trojan..|`|dfTQCf5saa	I'm not sure.<br>  But it must be derived from something true-based you would think?<br>  I don't think the Gods or whatever were involved.<br>  But I think the whole hiding in the horse thing was awesome!<br>  Not for the guys, but the whole scheme and idea is pretty amazing.|`|ajSQYvINaa	yes<br>  search it on yahoo

There is supposed to be a lot of underwater volcanic activity in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle.  Scientists believe that these volcanoes can disgorge bubbles of volcanic gas perhaps as large as a quarter-of-a-mile in diameter. Because volcanic gas is lighter than air and often extremely toxic, if a ship happens to be floating above one of these bubble it will immediately lose buoyancy and go straight to the bottom.  Same for an airplane.  If a plane flies into one of these bubble it will immediately lose lift and plunge nose first into the sea.

iCgpyrmUaa	Here I discovered that the atheists were rummaging through various atheist websites that seem to have done their homework on Hitler. One letter noted that Hitler was “raised as a Roman Catholic.” Another quoted Hitler saying in a speech during the early 1930s that he was “doing the Lord’s work.” Another provided an excerpt of one of Hitler’s speeches praising Christ as a valiant opponent of the Jews. The atheist message was that Hitler was not one of them, he was one of us.<br>  <br>  The poverty of the atheist argument becomes clear with a bit of examination. What does it prove to say that Hitler was raised Catholic? Stalin was raised in the Orthodox Church. Mao was raised as a Buddhist. Lots of people repudiate their religious upbringing. Hitler vehemently rejected the traditional Christianity in which he was raised. During the period of his ascent to power, he needed the support of the German people — mostly Christian, mostly Lutheran — and he occasionally used boilerplate rhetoric such as “I am doing the Lord’s work” to try and secure this. This rhetoric, it should be noted, is a commonplace rhetorical device among atheist writers. Nietzsche, for instance, regularly compared himself to Jesus, even titling one of his books Ecce Homo (“behold the man,” a biblical reference to Christ). But no intelligent reader of Nietzsche can doubt that he was a rabid atheist, as was Hitler. One should not confuse political opportunism with personal conviction. Not surprisingly, Hitler invoked Christ’s death at the hands of the Jews in order to solicit Christian support for his (secular and racial, not religious) anti-Semitic agenda.<br>  <br>  Once Hitler and the Nazis came to power, however, they denounced Christianity and launched a ruthless drive to subdue and weaken traditional Christianity.<br>  <br>  Here are some of  Hitler's quotes that many atheists do not wish to share.   <br>  <br>   National Socialism and religion cannot exist together.... The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (p 6 & 7) <br>  <br>  <br>   Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure. (p 43) <br>  <br>  <br>  The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread... Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.... Christianity has reached the peak of absurdity.... And that's why someday its structure will collapse.... ...the only way to get rid of Christianity is to allow it to die little by little.... Christianity [is] the liar.... We'll see to it that the Churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the State. (p 49-52) <br>  <br>   The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges: the pox and Christianity. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be surprised if they say Mao,Stalin were not atheists.|`|AA11048813	Many a time my wife has wanted to kill (and I don't mean metaphorically or allegorically) me because it would have been justifiable homicide - but not in the name of science. but in the name of sanity - hers.

(On his way to school young Adolf daily observed a stone arch which was carved with the monastery’s coat of arms bearing a swastika.)<br>  <br>  c) Hitler was a communicant and an altar boy in the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  d) As a young man he was confirmed as a “soldier of Christ.”  His most ardent goal at the time was to become a priest.  Hitler writes of his love for the church and clergy: “I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals.  As was only natural, the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal.”  -Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)<br>  <br>  e) Hitler was NEVER excommunicated nor condemned by his church.  Matter of fact the Church felt he was JUST and “avenging for God” in attacking the Jews for they deemed the Semites the killers of Jesus.<br>  <br>  f) Hitler, Franco and Mussolini were given VETO power over whom the pope could appoint as a bishop in Germany, Spain and Italy.  In turn they surtaxed the Catholics and gave the money to the Vatican.  Hitler wrote a speech in which he talks about this alliance, this is an excerpt: “The fact that the Vatican is concluding a treaty with the new Germany means the acknowledgement of the National Socialist state by the Catholic Church.  This treaty shows the whole world clearly and unequivocally that the assertion that National Socialism [Nazism] is hostile to religion is a lie.”  Adolf Hitler, 22 July 1933, writing to the Nazi Party<br>  <br>  Hitler and the Popeg) Hitler worked CLOSELY with Pope Pius in converting Germanic society and supporting the church.  The Church absorbed Nazi ideals and preached them as part of their sermons in turn Hitler placed Catholic teachings in public education.  This photo depicts Hitler with Archbishop Cesare Orsenigo, the papal nuncio in Berlin.  It was taken On April 20, 1939, when Orsenigo celebrated Hitler’s birthday.  The celebrations were initiated by Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) and became a tradition.<br>  <br>  Each April 20, Cardinal Bertram of Berlin was to send “warmest congratulations to the Fuhrer in the name of the bishops and the dioceses in Germany with “fervent prayers which the Catholics of Germany are sending to heaven on their altars.”  (If you would like to know more about the secret dealings of Hitler and the Pope I recommend you get a book titled: Hitler’s Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII, by John Cornwell)<br>  <br>  h) Due to Hitler’s involvement with the Church he began enacting doctrines of the Church as law.  He outlawed all abortion, raged a death war on all homosexuals, and demanded corporal punishment in schools and home.  Many times Hitler addressed the church and promised that Germany would implement its teachings: “The National Socialist State professes its allegiance to positive Christianity.  It will be its honest endeavor to protect both the great Christian Confessions in their rights, to secure them from interference with their doctrines (Lehren), and in their duties to constitute a harmony with the views and the exigencies of the State of today.”  –Adolf Hitler, on 26 June 1934, to Catholic bishops to assure them that he would take action against the new pagan propaganda “Providence has caused me to be Catholic, and I know therefore how to handle this Church.”  -Adolf Hitler, reportedly to have said in Berlin in 1936 on the enmity of the Catholic Church to National Socialism<br>  <br>  and does "gott mit uns" sound familiar?<br>  <br>      "I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator."<br>  <br>      [Adolph Hitler, _Mein Kampf_, pp. 46]<br>  <br>      "What we have to fight for...is the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the Creator."<br>  <br>      [Adolph Hitler, _Mein Kampf_, pp. 125]<br>  <br>      "This human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief."<br>  <br>      [Adolph Hitler, _Mein Kampf_, pp.152]<br>  <br>      "And the founder of Christianity made no secret indeed of his estimation of the Jewish people.

If the paper discusses claimed evidence for an old earth and/or universe, does this paper offer a very<br>  constructively positive criticism and provide a possible young-earth, young-universe alternative?<br>  5. If the paper is polemical in nature, does it deal with a topic rarely discussed within the origins<br>  debate?<br>  6. Does this paper provide evidence of faithfulness to the grammatical-historical/normative interpretation<br>  of Scripture? If necessary, refer to: R. E. Walsh, 1986. Biblical hermeneutics and creation. Proceedings<br>  First International Conference on Creationism, vol. 1, pp. 121–127. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Creation<br>  Science Fellowship.<br>  <br>  Remark:<br>  The editor-in-chief will not be afraid to reject a paper if it does not properly satisfy the above criteria or it<br>  conflicts with the best interests of AiG as judged by its biblical stand and goals outlined in its statement of<br>  faith. The editors play a very important initial role in preserving a high level of quality in the ARJ.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	I know their answer.<br>  <br>  "When you look at the complexity of life, there is no way you can say that it all happened by chance. A higher power has to be at work".<br>  <br>  Well if complexity necessitates a creator, wouldn't a creator need a creator?<br>  <br>  It's simple logic.|`|MeFeazFiaa	No more evidence than they have for the existence of God, Jesus, Heaven, Hell, the validity of the Bible or an afterlife.  Nothing, nix, zilch.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  I see the sunsandrain troll is at it again copy and posting his usual nonsense.|`|WjRqYf6naa	No, I don't. I take Creationism (Old Earth style) strictly on faith, and for that I do not apologize.|`|WF085j2Daa	they dont need evidence they have the bible and vivid imaginations|`|AA12360689	Look around you.  The evidence is there.  When talking about God as the creator the apostle Paul wrote the following in Romans 1:19-20:  "because what may be known about God is manifest among them, for God made it manifest to them. 20?For his invisible [qualities] are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable."<br>  There is no excuse for those who deny the existence of God when the evidence is all around them.|`|v0596BTeaa	Well, what a silly question.  It tells you all about it in the bible, so it must be true.<br>  Oh, you meant actual, real, hard, empirical evidence?<br>  Well, no then.|`|51yi7HKsaa	God told us through His word that there is enough evidence in the world around us so that no one has any excuse.<br>  Even if you believe there was a big bang, the energy had to come from somewhere.|`|AA11048813	Creationism is allegory.  So said Reverend Billy Graham and Pope John-Paul II.  The essence of Chrstianity is one's relationship with Jesus and not all that other trivia.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. in life we may not come across proof for certain things. living a life will teach us every thing.|`|51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	No.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	Outside of their Bible? Of course not.|`|gkThLcf2aa	Its not likely|`|jjwdSeYTaa	What kind of thing could constitute proof? It seems like anything a creationist could come up with would necessarily be compatible with a scientific understanding of the world (unless you're committed to believing in miracles), but also that anything we find out about the world through science, even if we discover how the universe first began, would still be compatible with creationism. <br>  <br>  For example: Sure the Big Bang theory might be right, but God may have started the Big Bang off. Sure God may have started the universe off, but scientific laws still accurately describe how it works.|`|bUDOZFDAaa	which came first the chicken or the egg? something had to make one of them right.<br>  <br>  the fact is there really isn't evidence either way. so logic and reason must be applied. <br>  <br>  i do have to ask where is there a hole in the idea? creationism doesn't disprove evolution why cant both ideas have truth.|`|Vc1CT2e8aa	oh, havent you been listened to the christian crackpots on here?<br>  <br>  god created everything apparently, this myth(god) apparently is above science.<br>  evolution is proven.....there can only be one answer to that question.|`|ugXmnfkzaa	your exactly right about faith. it leaves people to fill in the blanks themselves. they have no facts or proof or ..really anything but some made up book. so yeah its a bunch of hogwash.|`|C12T1eFGaa	Disproving evolution is so cliche. I prefer to disprove our ability to prove anything. The ladies really dig it!<br>  <br>  Haven't seen any evidence though.|`|edf9fUtNaa	The fact that life exists combined with people's refusal to think is all the "evidence" they need.|`|fbDb6g0Qaa	yes,  only the bible reveals sin in people other books deny it
E9chZY74aa	God will not force you to be with Him when it is your lifelong decision to refuse Him.  He is just as well as loving.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Same questions, same answers:<br>  <br>  I agree the notion of my child burning in hell forever is a troubling and disturbing concept.  Yet isn't that the point?  It's called a consequence.  We either follow God and reap the rewards or we follow the Other and suffer the consequence. <br>  <br>  It seems awfully convenient to not believe in hell.  In this way you never have to worry about your sins or their repercussions.   But let's consider the implications.<br>  <br>  I'm going to make another assumption for the sake of argument and say that you are a good person.  So being a good person when you pass on you'll be welcome into heaven.  In heaven you'll be greeted by the likes of Nero, Vlad the Impaler, Genghis Khan, Nobunaga, Pol Pot, Hitler, Mussolini, etc. etc.  Doesn't that sound great and perfectly logical!<br>  <br>  Give me a break.  The very idea of those men (and I use the term loosely) making their way into heaven after all the evil and atrocities they've committed is practically blasphemous.  Yes the Lord will forgive all who ask of Him but I sincerely doubt that men as incredibly evil as the aforementioned would be so inclined to humble themselves before God.<br>  <br>  Hell exists because free will is a matter of choice.  Good or evil.  All choices bare consequences.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	A person who, through incorrect choice and the lunacy of misguidance, is intoxicated with unbelief, imagines this hospice of the world, which belongs to the All-Wise Maker, to be the plaything of chance and natural forces. He fancies the passage of creatures into the World of the Unseen, that is in fact renewing the manifestation of the Divine Names, to be execution and annihilation. He supposes the echoes of those creatures’ glorification of God, who are accomplishing their duties with the passing of time, to be the lamentations of death and eternal separation. He deems the pages of created beings, which are inscriptions of the Eternally Besought One, to be meaningless and confused. He imagines the door of the grave, which opens onto the world of mercy, to be the entrance to the darkness of non-existence. And he deems the appointed hour, which is in reality an invitation to join his true friends, to be the onset of separation from all of them.<br>  Such a person both brings upon himself grievous and ghastly torments, and denies, denigrates and insults all beings and God’s Names and His inscriptions. He is, therefore, not only unworthy of compassion and sympathy but also deserving of severe punishment. He is not in any way worthy of pity.|`|be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	I like the Anne Rice theory...in that weird 'I'm exploring my Faith' book she wrote...where the devil has a mandate from God to take the bad people, torture them for a bit, then prepare them for heaven. I think I'm remembering it wrong, it was a terrible book after all. But what the hey, this is the theory I'm going with:<br>  <br>  Because God likes to see us suffer for not kissing his benevolent backside all those years. Apparently he has a bit of a rock star complex..."LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE ME!!!"|`|xPeIvywdaa	He wanted people who chose to love Him, if He just put us in heaven we would be a bunch of automatons forced to love Him and thats not what He wanted<br>  <br>  we are given free will to choose|`|qRue8Xdraa	Because God doesn't love us, duh. FSM does!|`|13c36f0b8ad9a3e212bb0604e034744aaa	I have often wondered about the same thing. If a god did exist, and he did create us; why did he give us free will so that we can do things which will break his heart and drive us (whom everyone claims he loves) into everlasting hell. Seems to me the actions of a SPITEFULL CHILDISH deity, rather than a loving god.|`|dRXJro4kaa	he loves us to become mature,and when we don't become he becomes angry.when human goes to hell he get punished.but 90% godly ppl say that one day after all punishes all ppl go to heaven(except some that God has said they are in hell for eternity:heretics,infidels)|`|C12T1eFGaa	Only holiness can enter into the presence of god. Heck, most of his own servants must be "tried by fire" before entering into His Presense. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about other souls. Worry about your own soul. The lord calls out to everyone before their death. When he does so, answer back.|`|ljFc4gbTaa	it's a matter of choice to us. if you'll love him back, you go to heaven. if you keep on offending him and not have even a little regret in your heart, you go where you belong. it's like taking a plane, you choose your destination.|`|j4n95V8gaa	Because God is not unjust that in spite of wrong doings He will let us in Heaven.<br>  <br>  He has in fact given us a way to be forgiven, but that's upto you.<br>  That's the only key to get into Heaven & the way is Jesus.|`|whkC5077aa	That would be too easy.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	This site is completely addictive and, once you get hooked, it is easy to spend hours looking at what other people say or answering questions that interest you. Whilst it should just be a short recreation, it progressively becomes a consuming monster. <br>  People who are at work should not be on here at this time unless it is during a break. People who are at home or who can dispose of their time as they please can do as they wish, but I know many  who have started neglecting tasks that they put off "till later", "till tomorrow" or never do. One good point is that if one is lonely and isolated it gives the illusion of belonging to a community, and it does give old people something to fill their time and to keep their brain alert.<br>  One does learn a lot of things from other people's answers, but how much does one remember that is actually useful?  Some people are chasing mythical points that are totally useless, answering questions that often they know nothing about, or actually contravening Yahoo  rules with monosyllabic answers like "yes", "no" or even just a question mark. This is supposed to be a site where help and information are given, or people's curiosity can be satisfied, but it has turned into a complete circus. I really admire one regular contributor who went cold turkey and dropped out once and for all.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

I consider myself a Christian but I do not blindly believe that everything in the Bible is a fact, I also do not believe that my way is the only way. The Bible was written by men therefore it was open to be changed to suit their culture and beliefs at the time, same with all other religious books. I have actually read a book written by the Dalia Lama and found it really interesting. He said in one chapter that in his view of Buddhism you cannot ignore what is scientific fact simply to satisfy your religious beliefs, you must change your religious views to reflect reality. I thought that really made sense. I like to follow something said by Albert Einstein. He said "Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind."

We do see devoted pairs in some species, but not among apes, our closest relatives.  So I think that people are kidding themselves if they are shocked by the fact that sex occurs outside of marriage.  It is only realistic to look at the temptation and desire to venture into other sexual relationships<br>  <br>  The early period of intense romantic and sexual interest in one person that often leads to a committed relationship does not last for ever.  Some people make the transition  to a new phase in the relationship without much difficulty, but some , both males and females, will want to maintain the primary connection and still admit the possibility of other sexual opportunities. If the couple have agreed to an open relationship and maintain open and honest communication, no betrayal is committed.

If your partner is OK with your sleeping around, then there is no issue. If you partner is not on board with it, it means you are hiding something from your partner, possibly even to the point of lying. <br>  <br>  Atheists consider lying morally wrong, as it hurts actual people in this life (and not just some higher/paranormal/godly superbeing). <br>  <br>  As we atheists believe this life and this world is all we have, we tend to be extra careful to make the most of it. This can include for some people - including me - sleeping around quite a bit. But it will also entail trying not to hurt anyone, as hurt make this life miserable and, unlike christians or muslims, we have no afterlife to make up for it. <br>  <br>  So for most atheists, this latter goal (not huring anyone) would always thrump the first (having fun). Not only because hurting and lying poses moral problems, but also because having fun is short-term, which is less important than investing in real relationships. This is especially true if the one you are hurting is someone important, like your spouse/girlfriend/boyfriend.<br>  <br>  But, as said, if you and your partner is OK with it, there is no reason not to have some fun on the side, as the problem is not sex or sin itself, but only the implications of your actions for actual existing people.|`|xGI9z01Maa	I'm an Atheist but marriage is a contract.  With any contract you draw up conditions of that contract.  With the marriage contract, you agree that you will not be sleeping with other people (adultery).  If you break that contract, then you are wrong.  But contracts in business can be redone.  If you can redo the contract and both parties agree without pressure, then you are fine.  But most people don't want to redo the contract.  Personal, I would not want to redo the contract because of AIDS and other things that you can get, including a new member to the contract that wants the other party to break their contract with you to form a contract with them.  And feelings tend to be tied to sex which changes the relationship and the contract.  Because most people can't have sex and not love and not want to be with the one they love more then the one that they were first with.|`|DnTbVbS9aa	I think that if you ask your spouse and get their permission and dont try to hide it at all, and are prepared to take no for an answer, there's really nothing wrong with it...<br>  <br>  The problem with adultery, really, is that it breeds lies and contempt between people who should love each other. If you can do it without any ill feelings at all then there's nothing innately wrong with adultery, but lets be honest, most people are nowhere near emotionally mature enough to deal with that.|`|13c36f0b8ad9a3e212bb0604e034744aaa	I do not believe in sin.

Many Biblical scholars don't really think that the gospels were actually written by Mark, Luke, John, Matthew but it was common practice to attribute the story to the authority it supposedly represented. Even if you believed that it was authored by them the stories are a testimony to human fallibility in memory rather then the inerrant guided word of a deity.

G4SVG7tKaa	Funny how organized religionists equate swallowing rigid doctrines and dogmas with actual spirituality. They don't realize that once you subscribe to an organized religion's version of spirituality you've already lost it (or never had it to begin with) because you're...well, STUCK with its rigid doctrines that you have to abide by. That isn't spirituality by its true meaning - it's delusion.<br>  <br>  In order for monotheists to counter the non-believers (who point out that because there is good and evil in the world, God must have created it, since he created all), they refer to the invented embodiment of evil itself, a fallen angel named Lucifer, later known as Satan or Beelzebub. That took care of the "why evil" question with the creation of a scapegoat for the crap that happens to us humans. Pretty smart, eh? Anything bad is the devil's doing, while all that is "good" and "miraculous" comes at the hand of God. This explanation for the duality of religion is understandable to all simpletons.<br>  <br>  Edit to It's Between You and God - My "governing doctrine" is the secular laws of the land and my innate sense of what is right and wrong. If you want your Bible to be "governing," then you should dash little children to pieces, commit incest, murder the first born of any nation belligerent to yours, firebomb "wicked" fornicators and homosexuals, perpetuate slavery and second-class citizenship to women, and basically stick your malignantly moral nose into what consenting adults do behind closed doors.

They are constantly manifested through change and transformation. Their wheels turn like the workshop of the crops of some other world.<br>  Of a certainty, the branches and results, which are opposites, of those two elements will continue into eternity; they will become concentrated and separate from one another. Then they will be manifested in the form of Paradise and Hell. Since it is out of this transient world that the permanent world will be made, its fundamental elements will certainly go to eternity and permanence.<br>  Indeed, Paradise and Hell are the two fruits of the branch of the tree of creation, which stretches, inclines, and goes towards eternity; they are the two results of the chain of the universe; the two storehouses of this flood of Divine activity; the two pools of beings, which flow in waves towards eternity; and the place of manifestation, the one of Divine favour, the other of Divine wrath. When the hand of power shakes up the universe with a violent motion, those two pools will fill up with the appropriate matters.|`|I1tfz8nVaa	I don't think so, it's stating what is good and evil that is the problem.

The rules of religions were created by man not by God.   <br>  <br>  <br>  It seems to me that the atheistic dogma provides its disciples with the convenience of a life style devoid of moral consequences.

No thought needed.|`|u33x2hqzaa	Even if some people take it that way, religion is a lot more than "my way or the highway."  Its our attempt to know the Unknowable and to live in harmony with ourselves and our neighbor.

There's a lot more to religion and to fairy tales for that matter then meets the eye.<br>  <br>  Good and evil isn't the most overused concept in history because it resides in the heart of everyone and it's up to us to choose wisely or suffer the consequences.  That's what I call "live and learn."|`|WbaN6osZaa	Satans best trick is by convincing ppl he doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  Athiest ironically prove Satan by not believing in him, they think theres no good or evil just do what they want.<br>  <br>  Atheist are dead in the spirit as super kitteh says.

This is not a logic argument. Many people believe in God but in a wrong way so it s not of those who believe right or God.It s their pride. They think that they can know by their self the right way. Or religion is about asking others. For example  someone told me that(he,she) doesn t belive that drinking alchohool is a sin because it s written in the Bible. I said depends by the effects that alchohool has on you. If they are bad, it is a sin.

Stop following the traditions that harm people, and keep the ones that actually bring people together.<br>  <br>  But I have to wonder... You do know that the Obamas  were planning to get a dog for their daughters before Mr. Obama ran for President, right?

gkdccYQoaa	I  will have to agree with allonyoav as this "scholar" knows about the petty predictions mentioned in the Bible like he says that the Bible predictions are like predicting that the sun will rise tomorrow. <br>  <br>  But the Torah gives accurate and precise predictions.Just have a look at some of them.<br>  written in the Torah. 9:26 Nehemiah says "We killed the prophets". Didn't they?<br>   God tells Ezekiel the prophet that HE is going to send him to a nation of rebels.(Israel) aren't they? <br>  Jeremiah 9:16 "I will scatter them among the nations" For instance allonyoav, the orthodox jew is staying in South Africa instead of the promised land, Israel.<br>  <br>  Moses says to the Israelites you have been stiff necked as long as I have known you & after I die you are going to become even worse. When Moses did not come down from Sinai the Israelites wanted to make a golden calf but when the elders rebuked them they killed the elders and Aaron gives in to them saying "they have killed the elders they are going to kill me next" Isaiah says to Jerusalem "It is a city full of murderers".<br>  <br>  Isaiah says "Israel's watchmen are blind,they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep.They are dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough.They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, each seeks his own gain."<br>  <br>  Again Isaiah is quoted saying "But you—come here, you sons of a sorceress,you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes! Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?"<br>  <br>  Aren't these prophecies and descriptions about them so true!!!|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Virtually ever single cult or religion predicts the same thing.  Even the cults formed around the 2012 drivel say so they will be mocked or even persecuted and there is a (government) conspiracy to hide the truth of what they are saying.  It is universal and not confined to Christianity.  In-group dynamics.  <br>  <br>  I think you already knew that.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	It's not only Christians that get mocked, Atheists Jews and muslims too.  The Bible does say that Christians will be persecuted for their beliefs but it was just saying so as a reminder.  <br>  <br>  The Koran also states the same will happen with Muslims ( I do not agree with Koranic teachings just saying), why have you singled out Christians? - or have you not read the Koran? So are you saying that the Bible should not have said it because it sounds too obvious? The Bible is a Holy book, to help, remind and spriritually teach.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Pretty easy to predict people will mock, reject or criticize religions.<br>  <br>  BTW, what about Christians mocking Christians, such as one denomination saying others are not true Christians, or that Catholics are not Christians? Or even that other religions also have "predictions" that their religion would be mocked, criticized and rejected?|`|8OeulLkmaa	Christians do not mind being put down.  We count it par for the course.  It's suppose to happen.  I do not call it persecution.  I call it WAR.  And we win in the end...HA.<br>  <br>  <br>  We pity you mockers.  Honestly..  It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Hehe, good one Hugo.<br>  <br>  Come on. Anybody can predict people will make fun of Christians when you make up stories with talking snakes and big fish and big boats with two of every animal.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	You are aware that people have mocked Jews since time immemorial, and Muslims get their fare share of it, too, aren't you?<br>  <br>  Just saying...|`|AA11047076	How do we deal with the fact that it predicts Christians will be mocked?  We laugh at the so called prediction.  Its so obvious its like predicting that the sun will rise tomorrow- and nobody will ever know if it doesn't since we would all be dead!  Making statements which are certainties might make you look prophetic- but to other people it just makes you laughable<br>  <br>  As for false prophets- yep, we are aware of those predictions- and would point out that Christians worship the most successful of those false prophets!|`|UO3i8BqVaa	Firstly please list where these prophesies occurred and do NOT mix up Jewish and Muzzle literature.<br>  <br>  Secondly, anyone knows people that stick their neck out are gonna get cut.<br>  What?<br>  You think it's some kind od whoowhoo prophesy?<br>  Jeez, how gullible are you.<br>  <br>  "Too many coincidences, the Bible was obviously true unless you deny."<br>  You are being a drama queen.<br>  Do you know that the Christian cult guide book is nothing more than fairy tales and bogeyman stories written by men in order to keep the uneducated masses amused, in line, and obeying commands to further the authors’ own socio-economic agenda?<br>  ~|`|87VmFMEoaa	Based on the timing of the actual writing of the Christian bible, that wasn't a prediction but a statement of what was already happening.  So sorry, doesn't count as a prediction to me.  Even if it were, it's so obvious that it hardly counts as proof for anything.|`|8I9uduIiaa	Why would I have to or feel the need to 'account' for anything in the scriptures of *another* faith???<br>  <br>  <br>  My own religious texts also make predictions. I go by them. I suggest YOU spend more time on your OWN faith and worry less about Jews and Muslims.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|wHs88ZdFaa	We never mock you, nor does our Quran. God has told us that the people you might find most friendly toward Muslims are Christians, and we also believe that Jesus was a true prophet of god.<br>  You see, we never tell anybody that jesus was wrong, but you have already told that you believe that Mohammad was a false prophet. If that's your bible, I deny it.|`|ZAs86x6xaa	1. That's not a difficult prediction to make.  "OK guys, you need to go around and preach about a guy who walked on water and rose from the dead... but I'll warn you, some people will make fun of you!"<br>  <br>  2.  There are always "false prophets" - that's just someone who disagrees with your religious belief. To them, you're the "false prophet".|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	I'm Muslim.I do not mock Christians (also people from other religions).<br>  I respect ever body's faith.|`|jFnKnDPcaa	Easy, the people writing it used it as a protection method. Naturally, people are going to ridicule the religion at some point, so if they "predict" this, people like you will notice that, get all hyped and think jesus is coming, and as a result become even more convinced that you're in the right religion. That way, the religion never dies. With false prophets... well is it really that hard to predict that people are going to pretend to be speaking on behalf of god for their own benefit? I think not. It really helps the religions reputation when these guys are proven to be nutcases and the church can turn around and say "well the bible said this was gonna happen".

Do not walk with those who scoff against the Lord, but seek to find the faith inside your soul and dust it off, then use it to create your own relationship with the LORD.|`|wljJg1UOaa	PSALM 1:1-6.<br>  <br>  BLESSED is the man <br>  that walketh not in The Counsel of the Ungodly,<br>  nor standeth in The Way of Sinners, <br>  nor sitteth in The Seat of the Scornful.<br>  2. But his delight is in The Law of the LORD;<br>  and in His Law doth he meditate day and night.<br>  3. And he shall be like a tree <br>  planted by the rivers of water,<br>  that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;<br>  his leaf also shall not wither;<br>  and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>  4. The Ungodly are not so: <br>  but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br>  5. Therefore the Ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment, <br>  nor Sinners in the Congregation of the Righteous.<br>  6. For the LORD knoweth The Way of the Righteous: <br>  but the Way of the Ungodly shall perish.<br>  <br>  ALL EVENTS IN LIFE can be described in terms of the exercise of, ignoring, ignorance of, or opposing of THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE HOLY AND GLORIOUS GOD ALMIGHTY. (Massive loss of dramatic momentum follows. Boredom may be experienced.)<br>  <br>  Meditation upon the Commandments of God are the Key to TOTAL RECALL of every event in our lives. Biblical meditation means to mutter or murmur a passage of scripture (not too long) over and over, witha view toward increasing knowledge and understanding of its content.<br>  <br>  When you repeatedly Totally Recall an event and its embedded Divine Principles, you will eventually perceive the LAWS which make the events work. For instance, Mankind at large just gazed up at the sky for like 5,500 years, before somebody REALLY looked- using mathematical coordinates to correlate his observations, and realized: " 'ang on! It's The Earth that revolves around the SUN- not vice versa! *Duh.*" The same smartposterior heard what some other wise guy said- "...Any idiot knows that a ten pound weight falls ten times faster than a one pound one..!" He said, "Let's see..?" He dropped a ten-pound weight and a one-pound weight and they reached the ground the same time.<br>  <br>  He was promptly arrested for witchcraft. ("What an IDIOT!" everyone said. "*Duh!*") The point is that Knowledge is ORGANIZED SENSE DATA. If you pass a certain street corner the Friday of payday, and experience a suddenly flash as of light, and wake up later, with a lump on your head, and an empty space in your pocket where your wallet used to be, if you REFUSE to ALIGN the data, you will NEVER understand till the day that you get your head split wide open, that some junkie [*Bleep!*]ard is MUGGING you! Better take another route home! Yet there are people who do the equivalent of that all their lives.<br>  <br>     IMPORTANT DIANETICS AXIOMS.      L. Ron Hubbard<br>  <br>  22. Theta and Thought are similar orders of static. <br>  23. All Thought is concerned with Motion. <br>  26. Thought is accomplished by Theta Facsimiles <br>  of Physical Universe, entities or actions. <br>  99. Theta Facsimiles can recombine into new symbols. <br>  100. Language is the symbolization of effort. <br>  101. Language depends for its force <br>  upon the force which accompanied its definition. <br>  (Note: Counter-effort, not language, is aberrative.) <br>  103. Intelligence depends on the ability <br>  to select aligned or misaligned data <br>  from an area of randomity and so discover a solution <br>  to reduce all randomity in that area. <br>  109. Behavior is modified by Counter-Efforts <br>  which have impinged on the organism. <br>  110. The component parts of Theta <br>  are Affinity, Reality, and Communication. <br>  111. Self-Determinism consists of <br>  maximal Affinity, Reality and Communication. <br>  112. Affinity is the cohesion of theta. <br>  Affinity manifests itself as the recognition <br>  of similarity of efforts and goals <br>  amongst organisms by those organisms. <br>  113. Reality is the agreement upon perceptions <br>  and data in the Physical Universe. <br>  All that we can be sure is Real <br>  is that on which we have Agreed is Real. <br>  Agreement is the essence of Reality. <br>  114. Communication is the interchange <br>  of perception through the Material Universe <br>  between organisms <br>  or the perception of the Material Universe <br>  by sense channels. <br>  115. Self-Determinism is the Theta <br>  control of the organism. <br>  116. A Self-Determined Effort is that <br>  Counter-Effort which has been received <br>  into the organism in the Past and integrated <br>  into the organism for its conscious use. <br>  117. The components of Self-Determinism are <br>  Affinity, Communication and Reality. <br>  Self-Determinism is manifested along each Dynamic. <br>  118. An organism cannot become aberrated <br>  unless it has agreed upon that aberration, <br>  has been in communication with a source of aberration, <br>  and has had affinity for the aberrator.<br>  119. Agreement with any Source, contra- or pro-Survival, <br>  postulates a New Reality for the organism. <br>  121. Every Thought has been preceded by Physical Action. <br>  122. The Mind does with Thought <br>  as it has done with entitles in the Physical Universe. <br>  127. All perceptions reaching the organism's sense channels<br>  are recorded and stored by Theta Facsimile. <br>  Definition: Perception is the process of recording data <br>  from the Physical|`|kO53ZuIKaa	<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel248.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/autho...</a><br>  <br>  (and, if you're feeling brave, <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanatiloka/wheel394.html#ch2" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/autho...</a> )|`|9b5935684568a7cb72fa426091885e25aa	In a situation of death there arent proper ways to explain why how etc sometimes ur left with a void ur left with nothing but our faith in christ|`|I1tfz8nVaa	Should there be an answer?|`|ET5OlQGwaa	Yes you can ask GOD.

This is in IMITATION of our Divine Master who also did not marry, because He was already wedded to his flock the Church.  It is true that several Biblical Apostles (including Peter) were married, but, as Paul wrote, you must come as you are called, and those who are called must remain in their calling, and also that one who is married will give attention to their spouse, but the single will give their attention to God.  It is NOT an absolute requirement to be single, but exceptions are understandably intended to be rare and singular, and even in the Eastern Rites (and East Orthodox, for that matter), where married priests are more common, only the single, often having come up from a monastery, get chosen to be bishops.|`|a7e4527ac6ed1229d8be6f0ca3adf702aa	No.<br>  <br>  The Satan is making every effort into pulling all human beings into darkness and eternal damnation away from the Resurrected and Living Holy One Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Read the Holy Bible 1 Corinthians 7:9<br>  But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.<br>  Holy Bible 1 Timothy 3:2<br>  A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<br>  <br>  We are to live as human beings in obedience to the Holy Eternal God Almighty according to the Holy Word of God - the Holy Bible and with the guidance of the Holy Spirit of God.<br>  <br>  The Holy Eternal Heavenly Father God Almigty created everything including the planet earth for human beings to live in love as a human family of mankind bearing children into generations with the gift of Life.<br>  <br>  Holy Bible 2 Peter 2:9<br>  The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:<br>  <br>  God bless you in Christ Jesus mighty name.|`|cTKrByOzaa	No the Bible, Qor'an and Torah all say unequivocably that a priestly class should not exist.<br>  <br>  The issue isn't should a priest marry it's should a priest exist in the first place.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	no. that came later and delt with property issues. when a priest died his wife or family could lay claim to a church. not wanting to give up real estate catholic priests we ordered not to marry|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	Not at all.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

It's just one big studio xD<br>  <br>  and that article is long =||`|BVVvb8Ieaa	Nice argument from ignorance.<br>  <br>  A) "why they did not land second time?" Because they did, and a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, and sixth (would have been 7 if not for the Apollo 13 disaster)....So, your premise is kind of flawed there buddy.<br>  <br>  B) So they faked it, but did it in a wind tunnel, thinking nobody would notice....? Right......<br>  Or maybe, it is doing so because an astronaut was moving the pole to which it is attached, and it is in a place of low gravity.<br>  <br>  C)  The lunar photographs show no stars in them because they were exposed for the daylight lit lunar scenes! This badly underexposes any stars in the sky. Try setting up a manual camera  - use the "sunny 16" rule where you set the f-stop of your camera to f/16 and then set the exposure length to the recipricol of the ASA film speed - if you use ASA 100 film, use 1/100 of a second (or 1/125 which is more typically available). Then take a picture of the sky at night. To be sure you're simulating the lunar situation, be sure to light up a foreground object with full daytime lighting so that the printing process will be sure to expose that part of the image properly and not super stretch the dark sky. You won't find a star image there either. <br>  <br>  D) They took pictures of Earth...from the moon...brought back moon rocks, people all over the world watched them go into space, other nations monitored the even, people watched live video feeds......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Ok Ok, minta maaf|`|I8YXhd1gaa	it was probably fake if thewy didnt do it again....and there were no stars in the backround<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.trueghosttales.com/img/moon-landing-2.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.trueghosttales.com/conspiracies/moon-landing.php&h=299&w=300&sz=12&tbnid=m-okcjO6XYnQqM::&tbnh=116&tbnw=116&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dmoon%2Blanding%2Bpicture&hl=en&usg=__oc5PBUWkiPsV1r8_Z2i2NVVaeIg=&ei=kUu2Sfj9EIrOMoSi-OgK&sa=X&oi=image_result&resnum=1&ct=image&cd=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http...</a>|`|FqLR9CUJaa	There is also very low gravity on the moon.

Apollo 14 astronaut Allen Shepard played golf on the Moon. In front of a worldwide TV audience, Mission Control teased him about slicing the ball to the right.

One NASA picture from Apollo 11 is looking up at Neil Armstrong about to take his giant step for mankind. The photographer must have been lying on the planet surface.

rThIVk2maa	Here's my question back to you: Why are you trying to impress these people? You cannot make everyone happy, and there is no reason for you to worry about their approval. Besides, if you're having to work at "being yourself", then who were you being before?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you should adopt the childish attitude of "I don't care what anyone thinks!"  because that is selfish. We all have to get along in this world and work for our common good, however, that doesn't mean you have to let anyone else tell you how you should behave, what you should say and how much you disclose about yourself. <br>  <br>  Remember, so long as you are being courteous and kind to others, think about the consequences of what you say before you say it, you do not owe it to anyone to tell more than you want to about yourself. You also don't have to worry about appearing "phony", because that is the accusation made by people who are generally pretty insecure. <br>  <br>  Just keep being nice, and if "being yourself" includes being private and quiet, well, there are worse qualities in a person, and few better ones.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	It takes time. Just keep doing what you are doing. I'm sure they will come around and even if they don't then that says more about them than you. You probably wouldn't want them around anyway.

As an old man, I just want to tell you something that hopefully will help.  That is, people come and go throughout your life.  If you lead a full and exciting life MANY people will pass through.  Most you will forget,  some you'd like to forget, some you'll cherish the memory of,  and a very, very few will remain close.  That is as it is supposed to be I think, unless you are in a very sheltered small town environment and never leave.  It isn't bad, just keep going with the flow, and meeting new people, learn new ideas, and don't stop growing intellectually.
bNLeCM1Oaa	Some people have the belief that one is taking a life when they have an abortion.  Others don't believe it's a life until born so one isn't taking a life. Still others use religion to justify there stance against abortions.  The reasons are varied from person to person.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Because a fetus is alive, and it is human.  After all, you owe your existence to the fact your mother decided not to abort you.|`|AA11347374	However you try to sugar-coat it, you ARE killing a baby when you have an abortion.<br>  I think abortion DOES have its place, as a medical procedure. It can save the Mom's life in come cases.

guJ62PZKaa	Well its just simply that every relationship cannot be equal. Even between people of different sexes one is more dominant in the relationship. The same goes for gays and lesbians.<br>  <br>  I am a lesbian and from what I personally see its like there are two types of lesbians. The ones that enjoy things more commonly enjoyed by men and therefore are also attracted to women. And the ones that are very femenin and yet are just attracted to women, maybe because they just are and alos sometimes it is because they have been mistreated by the men in there life.<br>  <br>  I was always hanging out with guys throughout high school because I would fit in with them better, we had more common interests, I just thought they were more fun. It led to me getting a girlfriend that I am very protective of, like most males. I mean for example its her who sits on my lap, held in my arms, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense to you.|`|13c36f0b8ad9a3e212bb0604e034744aaa	In more tradition societies, you would find that in a gay relationship one partner would take the role of female and the other of male. Here in South Africa there is even the tendency under the blacks to consider the 'girlie' boy as gay. his lover would however be a straight man, even though he is involved (sexually) with gay.<br>  <br>  None of the gay couples that I know take a specific role. There is no man or no wife, just two guys or two girls in love or in lust whatever the case may be.<br>  <br>  I am what some would consider BUTCH and most people say that they would never have guessed that I am gay. I also prefer men to be men. There is nothing wrong with the girlie boys, but it is simply not something I am attracted to. I am sure many gays would find my fat belly sickening and ugly. SO, it is all about what we like.<br>  <br>  Gays like people of the same sex. Personal taste would determine if that person acts as a male or female.<br>  <br>  LOL - Maybe mathematics can solve this.|`|FqLR9CUJaa	It's a matter of preference.  <br>  <br>  If you like apples and I don't then it does not change the fact that the same apple will taste different if you tasted it and I tasted it.<br>  <br>  Makes sense? no.

If the person is a good person, has high morals and standards to live by. I do think that some gay men and gay women are naturally more or less feminine or masculine. Although sometimes I do think it's a bit of an act until my neighbor was born.  I have a neighbor now 16; the boy is as feminine as they come. It is definitely not an act; at 3 or 4 he would wear a t-shirt down below the shoulder line and strut. Is super creative and very sensitive. He's always had a gay lisp to his voice. Once he was sitting on his porch listening to Shania Twain shaking his chest saying "Man I feel like a woman." So this is a guy who has always been a fem. But he too will find love and someone will love him for who he is. Will he play a "feminine role?" Maybe not. He's 6 foot and a broad sized teenager? Who knows.

TVJsOEKNaa	1. In Judaism 'faith' isn't necessarily a cornerstone, but a decision. Christian theology seems to place more emphasis on this. For most people, faith is not a rash decision but a conclusion. What I consider myself to be is Jewish. That means following the commandments.  <br>  <br>  2. Shabbat is the getaway from such things.  It's a time where one stops worrying about the outside world and focuses on their family, friends, Torah, God and rest. It doesn't conflict with any part of the religion. <br>  <br>  3. I'm not religious these days but to give you an idea: Shabbat is an expression of one's love for Judism, God and the Torah. It strengthens someone instead of making them worry: We try to avoid discussing everyday worries ON Shabbat as a general rule. However, Judaism is the kind of religion that encourages questions. As such, many topics are discussed on what is/isn't acceptable and why it may or may not be. This is why there is an entire book of Talmud devoted to the subject.<br>  <br>  4. The purpose is to commemorate the day God rested by resting. Shabbat does more than fulfill that purpose though: It reconnects families with each other (eg. there is no TV, radio, Internet, phone, etc..) and allows people to engage in different forms of discussion with focus and outlook.<br>  <br>  5. Definitely family time: It's a great thing to spend time with your family without any distractions. It's a positive impact. <br>  <br>  6. Most people make sure to have schedules which work around Shabbat: It's definitely better for family life in my opinion. As for making life easier or harder? Not really any harder. Weekly preparations can be draining and Fridays hectic though. <br>  <br>  7. I haven't been religious in a while: Life seems much more stressful without it to be honest and I sort of miss it generally.  <br>  <br>  8. People aren't allowed to work on Shabbat. I don't think it ever bothered any of my co-workers either: A lot of people get Sundays off for their religious functions - this is the same concept. I also don't go around publicizing my reasons for having taken off: My employers knew and were the only ones privy to that information. <br>  <br>  There are 39 laws of Shabbat and I don't really think any of them are that hard to follow. I am sure it would be harder for someone who wasn't raised this way however. If I had to pick one commandment however, I'd go with carrying money or buying something. <br>  <br>  The only real way we were affected was by having to prepare more beforehand. <br>  <br>  9. It isn't right now because of certain private circumstances, but it was very important to me growing up. I have a lot of wonderful associations and memories that come along with the holiday. It was a time for me to connect with my family, the Torah and God. It was also a time to meet new guests (a lot of people invite others over for dinner on Friday night), having large dinners with great food and specifically hearing wonderful stories from my father. My father has always been a very busy man who works long hours and travels constantly: Shabbat helped to give us a time to bond as a family.<br>  <br>  10. Definitely a positive way. <br>  <br>  If you are working on a thesis: Perhaps you should go to a Synagogue and see if you can spend a Shabbat with a family there. If you have any Jewish friends, you should ask too! It's a lot easier to understand if you've actually tried it out lol.|`|8I9uduIiaa	1 - I'm not Orthodox but certainly being Jewish profoundly affects my attitudes and sensibilities, yes.<br>  <br>  2 - no clash. We are commanded to keep the Shabbat holy.<br>  <br>  3 - the more religious a person is, the more strictly they keep the Shabbat. So Orthodox Jews will have many restrictions in addition to the basic ones, although in Judaism we don't view them as 'restrictions', I should note.<br>  <br>  4 - Shabbat is holy. It is a 'time apart', outside the normal routine. It is a time to be quiet and still; to reflect and pray, and also to spend time with family. The Friday night dinner is a lovely and important part of this.<br>  <br>  5 - I don't know of any 'negative' aspects to our Shabbat, no.<br>  <br>  6 - For Orthodox Jews, living in Orthodox communities, there will be no clash with social plans, as all their friends etc will also be keeping the Shabbat.<br>  <br>  Problems only tend to arise when, for instance, a Jewish person starts dating a more Orthodox Jew. Then it can feel strange for the less religious partner and if they are not happy to wait until after Shabbat goes out on Sat evening to go out, for instance, then it won't work. We are not meant to drive on Shabbat, or work etc. So in this situation, it can prove tricky.<br>  <br>  7 - Shabbat is an integral part of Judaism. I can't imagine not having the Friday night meal and that time with those close to me. The Friday night Synagogue service is also a lovely one.<br>  <br>  8 - I don't 'work' in the literal sense. But if my computer is already switched on, I may use it - but not for doing work.<br>  <br>  I've starred your post for my fellow Jews.

8ZJdjfMOaa	You're right, without the variety that exists, how could we distinguish the things that we have come to appreciate, even those things we don't accept, have helped us in our journey.<br>  <br>  Without differences, we might as well all be clones, living the exact same boring lives.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Nowhere in the history of the world has diversity been truly embraced.  It seems that with mankind's fallen heart, with birth in bondage to sin, differences are reasons to mock and ridicule, not celebrate.  Of course, we've had 10 years or more of liberalism's political correctness, which is its own version of religion.  It preaches as you do that we should "celebrate" our differences.<br>  <br>  The trouble is that it's counter intuitive, even a ridiculous lie!<br>  <br>  I'm a white man.  WHAT about people who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, or Greek are reasons for me to celebrate?  Most of them hate me under the unrelenting attacks of liberalism!<br>  <br>  I'm a Christian.  WHAT about people being Hindu, Muslim, Black Liberation Theologists, or Taoists are reasons for me to celebrate?  The Bible warns me against false gods and sham religions!<br>  <br>  I'm middle class.  I'm under attack by liberals who want to take my money for the poor.  Many of these poor people simply will not work!  The Bible says, "If a man will not work, he shall not eat."  Liberalism says, "Give him money!"  What's in it for me to celebrate such a difference?<br>  <br>  I'm hetereosexual.  I see homosexual as deviance, sin, distance from God, not unlike any other sin.  Liberalism says that this is a reason to celebrate?  Tell you what ... you invite Christians to your gay bars and WE'LL invite gays to our church, to teach them the gospel.  We'll celebrate our differences, alright!<br>  <br>  Just about everyday I have to hear about some minority's "important contributions" to the world.  Okay.  I think we call this have another's beliefs crammed down one's throat!  I DON'T CARE!!!|`|uD8d5V9Saa	Depends on "fitting the mold of society "and what is acceptable. <br>  Pedophiles don't fit the mold. We don't celebrate their difference.

OR simply plain old respecting fellow humans because they are humans like us.|`|mFGyonmTaa	Yes, but fear of differences has been around since the beginning of time...<br>  <br>  In the end, it's all about personal choice and acceptance...|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Yup! Certain religions and ideologies promote fear. Governments tell us to be afraid.|`|03ls3iXmaa	i agree i think the different mixes of cultures is what makes the world work.|`|3OUJkVKqaa	I don't think there's so much fear as there is stress and worry.

uFAoq4idaa	There is no big or small sin with God. All sins big or small have the same penalty for Him. Yes God is interested in what is in our hearts and minds. He can read our minds and sees our hearts. He knows who has a clean heart and a pure mind, He knows who are honest and the ones who lies. When we commit sin just be honest to Him. Confessing our sins to Him is what He is waiting from us. He is just and willing to forgive us,|`|pj2bnJgjaa	You misunderstand what "badness" is to God.  God sees a lust as adultery, hatred as murder.  God is looking for broken and contrite hearts.|`|NLinPsyhaa	All sin is equal with only one being unforgivable. David's heart was broken because of what he did and begged God for forgiveness, Saul did not.|`|bdcb53a68e5c9e2c2011fae51dde0005aa	When we confess and repent of our sin( genuinely), God honor that. Sin is sin no matter how big or small.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) It is to the best of my knowledge that King Saul in the Old Testament will not be in heaven.  Yet, King David will be.<br>  <br>  That is, of course, purely a matter of conjecture.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) King David's crime on a badness scale was far worse than what King Saul did.<br>  <br>  Are you serious?  What we might call Saul's most well-recognized sin is when he disobeyed a direct command from God and, when that sin was presented to him, made excuses.  There were several additional.  Perhaps you should read that again - and then read about David's many sins (I'm not sure to which of his many sins you are referring) and how he responded when his sin was made known to *him*.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) Does this go to prove that God isn't interested in the size of your sins, but He is interested in the hearts and minds of the sinners?<br>  <br>  No - you have failed to logically present your case.  To do so, you need<br>  a) to provide evidence that Saul's final fate is worse than David's<br>  b) to provide evidence that Saul's sins were less serious or equal in God's eyes compared to David's<br>  c) to then prove that the actions taken by each to obtain forgiveness from God were in some way equal<br>  <br>  *Then* you might be able to make a case that the sin is not as important to God as the attitude ("heart and mind") of the sinner.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>
AA10556726	B might be the only thing that would qualify as evidence.  There are a number of reasons that A could happen but all of them are natural - even if the people involved thought they were acting on God's command.  C is a subjective, personal experience and is not evidence.<br>  <br>  If B was observed, photographed and independently verified that it was not human caused in any way, shape or form and the writing was such as could not have resulted from natural causes, then it could be considered as evidence.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Its too bad none of those will ever happen.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	None of these things have happened.

The second is a freak natural occurence (and fails to account for the fact that the word for "God" is different in other languages.) The third is just a series of dreams, and at best is a matter of psychology, and at worst a matter of psychiatry.|`|urIm4YaBaa	A - I could see that happening without a god existing.<br>  B - I see words and pictures in the clouds all the time.<br>  C - Given that I was lying in bed when it ended, I would have to assume that it was all a dream.<br>  <br>  Really, if there's a god who wants to show he exists, he can do a much better job than weird events, handwriting, and dreamweaving. Accepting and passing the Randi challenge or inspiring one of his believers to develop a logical proof that he must exist would be much more effective.
BzrUWCsDaa	Yes you are correct.<br>  Sometimes rejection & ridicule can be discouraging but these words here are telling us not to take it to heart. There are going to be many who will not respond to the truth (after all, the road to life is narrow - Matthew 7 ) <br>  We should take the message to people but if they're not interested we should 'shake the dust off our feet' & continue to search for those who will respond. We are simply the messengers|`|A01w1dHqaa	That's right, hold your peace, regardless. Take not the distorted thoughts with you. Jesus washed his disciples' feet to symbolically remove thoughts carried from the past.Actions speak louder than words. We must be able to discern these thoughts from the ego, but still hold the pure concept of others as we do our own innocence. <br>  <br>  The Sodom and Gomorrah reference doesn't sound like Jesus to me.|`|nHizaTiDaa	Yes, you are right about we shouldn't be upset if people get rude if we witness to them.  Yes, just keep going.<br>  <br>  All we do is plant seeds- God does anything else.  The called out ones, will be called out- the sheep will hear the Master's voice.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Yes. this is teaching that we are only to spread the message just as Christ did. All He did was tell people of Himself and the way to gain salvation. Other relevant scriptures would be the parable of the sower and how the message will fall on deaf ears. Not all will believe, but all will hear and know.|`|oGVvEl3Maa	yes. i also concur...  looks like you have "hit the mark" once again.<br>  BULLS EYE!  50 POINTS. :)<br>  <br>  "He who is devoid of wisdom despises his neighbor,<br>  But a man of understanding holds his peace."  Proverbs 11:12|`|AoepHvNPaa	your spirit is soppose to lead you and if the spirit tells you the people wont change chance are they wont change|`|LeHpIFwyaa	I think you have it right.  You can speak to a turnip all day but you can never make it understand.  It also goes beyond seeking those with an open mind and heart to blessing them.  Asking God to protect them.  You are not to let the closed minded people make you negative, just shrug it off an move on.  Stay true to your soul and God, be kind, humble, and never judgmental or mean.  You get the idea.<br>  <br>  May you be blessed.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Yes., we are not to be imposing, just plain; and if they do not accept our good conversation in Christ, then we are to go our way.|`|A4G03Bzbaa	Basically it is telling you to punch babies.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	You have missed the point because it makes no sense what so ever.|`|999ecae3bd7991db2c05cbeac24ab665aa	yes you are on track. Your conduct is very important. You might just win them over eventually with that.|`|G2yUpoqfaa	It is more than just keep on going.  It is get out.  Stay away.  There may be little anyone can do to convert the sinners in such a place, but there is much that can be done in avoiding them.  Matthew gives a parable:<br>   <br>  And God adds an example of what will happen to any city which is filled with the filth of sin by mentioning again the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, filled with evil perversions of every kind.  If what happened to those cities is compared to the "house" of evil herein described in Matthew, that "house" will also be destroyed like the ancient cities and all will suffer hellfire eternally.|`|RM1vyVZqaa	Thank you for your excellent question.<br>  <br>  Een, <br>  <br>  11"Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave."<br>  <br>  - the disciples were to rely on the hospitality of strangers and not on their own means.<br>  <br>  Twee,<br>  <br>  12As you enter the home, give it your greeting. 13If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. <br>  <br>  -This is the sign of a worthy and safe household in which the first church Fathers were to stay.<br>  <br>  Drie,<br>  <br>  14If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. 15I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. <br>  <br>  -Let there be a sign of disgrace and pending judgment.<br>  <br>  Vier,<br>  <br>  16I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.<br>  <br>  -What a verse! The world is not a safe place. Spiritually, your faith, credentials and very lives will be in danger. Be clever about your conduct and remain above reproach. <br>  <br>  I hope this adds to your thoughts. God give you all grace!

And that because of his Grandfather's and father's successful medical practices, he was left independently wealthy.  Further, that he postponed publishing his ideas on natural selection because he was troubled by the implications.  That he finally did publish because other people (specifically Alfred Wallace) were reaching the same conclusions, but didn't have the wealth of evidence he had amassed on his round the world voyage on the HMS Beagle, right?  He did give co-credit to Wallace, even though he began to formulate the ideas long before Wallace was out of diapers.  If there had been no Darwin, there still would be the idea of Natural Selection to explain biodiversity.  It was inevitable, because it's what the evidence points to.|`|MeFeazFiaa	You do not know much about Darwin do you?|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	Darwin's atheism was not about faith in nothing, and his scientific knowledge was not driven by greed.<br>  <br>  If someday you learn what Science really is, you'll also have a better understanding of what faith is.<br>  Religious faith is rigid thinking, the opposite of Scientific thinking.|`|X548yCR6aa	Probably because it works.

I don't know that I would say he had faith in science, because faith is the act of believing in something that is not necessarily evident.  I'd say he trusted scientific method and the tangible result it provides.  Where he went wrong was extrapolating his findings without concrete evidence.  That's part of the reason that evolution remains a theory.<br>  <br>  Atheism is self-refuting.  To say with universal certainty that God/god does not exist, you must be omniscient.

First of all, Darwin didn't preach atheism, he came up w/ the theory of evolution and natural selection. Science is a way to explain how and why things happen.

It's unrequited love, what have you."[6] Stipe compared the song's theme to "Every Breath You Take" by The Police, saying, "It's just a classic obsession pop song. I've always felt the best kinds of songs are the ones where anybody can listen to it, put themselves in it and say, 'Yeah, that's me.'<br>  <br>  <br>  so, it certainly could be about a homosexual relationship, tho not explicitly|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	I never did understand the lyrics or the meaning of the characters in the video.

bK5MJCxhaa	I think some people grasp the literal meaning of the bible so rigidly that if one item was proven to be a metaphor, it would rock their faith in the entire book.<br>  <br>  They need to learn to hold their faith in an open hand instead of a fist.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	I believe the story of Adam and Eve. For me to actually believe in evolution would be me saying Adam and Eve were monkeys. That doesn't fly with me. <br>  <br>  I don't pick and choose what I want to believe in the Bible. I believe the entire Bible from Genesis through Revelations; to discredit anything in the Bible, I believe is blasphemy.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I agree with you. Just because it's in the Bible, doesn't mean it actually happened. It boils down to faith. For all we know, Lilith could have existed, but was taken out of the text while it was in translation simply because it was translated by men in a male dominated society. <br>  <br>  The Adam and Eve story does explain nicely why there is sin in the world, but did it actually happen ver batum? Just because I may not think that it happened exactly the way the Bible says doesn't mean that I don't believe that Jesus did come and die for our sins and forgives us with grace. <br>  <br>  Those who aren't open to new thoughts remind me of the townspeople in "Inherit the Wind". I'm more like Drummond, who takes the Bible and the copy of Darwin's book and thinks that there is something to both of them. I know pastors, including my own husband, who think that way as well.<br>  <br>  I went to a lay leader's retreat this weekend. There was a professor of Old Testament who did the Biblical section. (My husband had him for several of his classes when he was in seminary.) We didn't cover Adam and Eve, I think we started with the flood. Come to think of it, I would have liked to ask him his opinion on it. <br>  <br>  To me, belief in the Bible comes down to faith in it's basic theme-- The love, forgiveness and grace of God and that Jesus did die for one's sins and even rose again. I don't think that not having literal belief in the Bible does not make me a non-Christian. I have seen God's hand in my life and believe that I will continue to do so.|`|yHfsHp6naa	I think many christians keep quiet if they really believe in evolution. The fundies have hijacked christianity.|`|89MKzLl3aa	I am a Christian and pay extreme attention to every book in the bible, especially Genesis. Do I take the verses as 100% literal-no. I accept evolution as fact, and love to learn as much as I can about science. I think it was Galileo that said " the bible tells us how to get to Heaven and science tells us how the heavens work". I may be wrong about that, but I believe that all Christians would accept evolution if there weren't those that state it disproves God.<br>  <br>  Edit: The bible doesn't state that evolution contradicts creation-those are two separate processes. Does God have to even explain evolution in Genesis? Is there a need to have evolution explained? NO.<br>  <br>  The bible isn't a science book. It's a book that tells us how to live and that God made a perfect world exactly the way He wants it. God didn't reveal all the mysteries of faith and life in one single book in the Old Testament. For those who think that evolution disproves creation-how can you say that when the word evolution isn't in the bible. Perhaps God did explain it, but we havn't interpreted Genesis correctly. <br>  <br>  This message is for Christians who think that evolution disproves God. Who do you think you are telling others that you know more about the meaning of life than others? How can you say that Christians who believe in evolution arn't Christians? Have you had a pow-pow with God that you aren't telling us of? <br>  <br>  I don't want to be a smartass, but I am offended by my fellow Christians than I am of those who arn't Christians.|`|AA11849917	How can you call yourself a Christian if you call Jesus a liar?

It makes a strict, literal interpretation downright impossible. Your solution, discarding Genesis, is one that most Christians wouldn't take. Over the past few weeks, I've been considering the reason, and I'm developing a fair understanding of one of the core issues.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem, I would think, is Original Sin. If that story is discarded, then there is no need for Salvation. If there is no need for salvation, then the sacrifice of the Christ was meaningless. <br>  <br>  Spreading the faith to "save the souls" of the world is pointless, because there is no longer anything that needs to be saved. There isn't a moral point to being a Christian or accepting Jesus because morality and the afterlife are no longer connected to faith. Belief in Christianity would become nothing more than belief in certain bits of historical trivia.<br>  <br>  I can understand that they don't want their faith to become nothing more than a history lesson with some supernatural elements thrown in, but that ultimately has little bearing on modern living. They want a "living faith," as its called. Thus, they need the element of salvation--the elements of Original Sin. Thus, Genesis must be preserved.<br>  <br>  Evolution hurts a literal reading of Genesis. So does the Big Bang. So does the fact that thousands (maybe millions?) of people are easily living their lives while believing that Genesis is no more notable or plausible than any of the millions of creation myths around the world. All of it threatens the foundation of the living faith, and this foundation will not be discarded lightly. They'll grasp at misrepesentations and missing pieces of information that unbelievers might have, holding them as mysteries that can't be solved in time, just to give to keep their religion from looking meaningless.<br>  <br>  Some Christians have avoided this by considered Genesis to be a metaphor of some sort...but why would there be a need for a real, living savior to atone for the metaphorical sin of two fictional people? It doesn't really make a lot of sense, and I think that even most fundamentalists would agree with me on this point.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Some religious people think that evolution contradicts their beliefs - they are usually bible literalists or evangelicals.<br>  <br>  They are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and while I do not personally believe in 'god(s)' - it would be possible for everything that we see in this universe to have been set in motion by some kind of creator.<br>  <br>  Just highly improbable - especially the way this 'creator' has been described by various religions.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	My answer is not meant as a insult and i find the creation story not so much as a fact but a truth told in the understanding of the time with the understanding people had then.To me whether we came through a chain of events starting with a one cell amoeba the fact is GOD started it all.The old testament is a history of the Jewish people and there relation with God not a science book.|`|C02lxopxaa	im confused on u say ur a christian but u pay little or no attention to Genesis? isnt that part of the definition of  a christian a christian is a follower of  God and being a follower of God is following the Bible/ im  against evolution  cause it go's against what i believe|`|PKULDaC7aa	Christians feel that if evolution is real then certain parts of the bible obviously cannot be.

Whether the things he was talking about actually happened or not isn't important. He was trying to get a message across, not recite an accurate history.<br>  <br>  It's not the belief in god that upsets me about religion, (I just think that's an unproductive use of time) It's the total denial of reality which is common to many religious people. I don't mind people opening the bible.. just as long as they don't close their mind to everything else.<br>  <br>  I don't even hate the idea of intelligent design as much as I once did. If people need to squeeze god into the theory to accept a good dose of a scientific reasoning backed up with evidence, then I can live with that.<br>  <br>  Calling evolutions monkeys and wishing them to burn in Hell only drives an unnecessary wedge between science and religion. Science isn't the enemy of religion, it's only concerned with finding the reasons why things happen. Explaining how wonderfully intricate a system is makes it more amazing, not less. If you believe God is responsible for that incredible system it will only strengthen your belief.<br>  <br>  The people that viscously ridicule any kind of evolution (theistic or naturalistic) without any knowledge of it's process are the same kind of fundamentalist Christians that burned Giordano Bruno at the stake for claiming the Earth is round. Denying scientific evidence only serves to make Christianity look foolish, and pushes more people away from their church. (Which to be honest, I don't mind that much :) )<br>  <br>  Anyway.

And two, dance with their paradigms, making their models fit any "acceptable new data" in an a posteriori manner? <br>  <br>  Yet, they leap about making new suppositions based on new evidence- and discredit the Christian who also makes his ir her leaps of faith. <br>  <br>  Odd that.|`|XN0cYCATaa	We see this a lot. If creation is simply a myth, and if religion is simply superstition, why the anger? Certainly real knowledge and reality itself would easily override them, would they not? No one is furious that some refuse to walk under a ladder. It is laughed off and tolerated. Nor is it "religion" that seems to provoke many to this kind of ire, but rather Christianity itself -- and, in particular, the biblical Christianity that considers the Bible means what it says and says what it means. I don't think fantasy is threatening these people. I think their own rejection of God might be, however. It must be awfully hard to look at the whole of creation and attribute it to time and chance instead of intelligent design. It must be frightening, too, to have that point of view in and of itself: it gives man no hope, no meaning, no purpose, no outside reference point for his behavior or thoughts. It's every man for himself and "devil take the hindmost." That would frighten me, too. <br>  <br>  I don't suppose there has ever been an age in which people didn't think they had things pretty well figured out, or were at least well on the way. In the process, it has been declared that four elements make up everything (earth, water, fire, and air), that spontaneous generation was a fact, that the germ theory was bizarre foolishness -- the list is really interminable. Each time, human logic and reason held sway.  And each time the facts contradicted us. Have we learned nothing from history? Are we still so arrogant as to think we can actually depend on what we know is true today not to be contradicted by other facts tomorrow? To depend on logic and reason is to put one's faith in man's limited and fallible knowledge. That seems a dangerous proposition to me, especially when our Creator has given us some guidelines to work within if we want to discover scientific truths. His truths never change, whereas ours do, and radically, from generation to generation. (By the way, it was known that the earth was round thousands of years before Columbus. Suggest checking history.)<br>  Within its proper bounds, science can only deal with what can be tested and worked with in one way or another. Thus it is properly bound to naturalism. We cannot work in a controlled way with the supernatural (this is the subject of witchcraft and shamanism), nor can we adequately test it. Science can only discover what already is, and learn how to use it, take care of it, appreciate it. Because science is not in possession of ALL the facts, science is in no position to make a final judgment on anything. This makes science a changing thing, and rightfully so. In any field, you only need one new contrary fact to force a rearrangement of thinking regarding the entire field. It also might be noted that changing things are not stable foundations. A good deal of what we consider fact today might not be fact tomorrow and to presume this cannot happen it to be quite naive. Mankind must find something outside of his own limited knowledge and interpretations on which to base his life if he wants any security at all. Science cannot define meaning in life, nor was it meant to. And it is meaning -- purpose -- that must be found for a man to be satisfied and have a direction in his life.|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	I think that God created the earth in the order in which things supposedly evolved.  I cannot believe in evolution for this reason:  According to evolution man is the highest order of the evolution process so far.  That means that there could be no God because God would have evolved from humans.  It also means there could be no angels, which according to evolution might possibly be an in between of humans of God.  But if humans so far are the highest order then again no god.  Now because I believe that there is a God who created the heavens and earth I far rather believe the account in Genesis about how the world came into being.<br>  **Further, I find it impossible to believe that something as complex as say a nervous system in the humans is an accident.  Then that one system in the body works in harmony with all the other systems in a human body!  How is that an accident?  I find it hard to believe that plants give life sustaining oxygen and we in turn give plants there life sustaining carbon dioxide.  There is just to much balance in nature to show me that this earth didn't get here by intelligent design.|`|pj2bnJgjaa	Your first sentence pretty much says it all.  If you "pay no attention to the book of Genesis", then exactly when do you actually start "paying attention" ?  If Genesis is not true, or is irrelevant, what makes the Gospels true, or relevant ?  When in the Bible do you actually start paying attention? <br>  <br>  I suggest you go buy Ray Comfort's "Evolution: A Fairy Tale for Grown Ups", stop being brainwashed, and do something the science education community doesn't want you to do:  look at both sides of the issue and make a decision for yourself.|`|qZrpGcOkaa	When you accept Jesus in your heart as your Lord and savior, you are also saying you believe in the bible. That means EVERYTHING. When you say that adam and eve didn't exist then you are saying that the bible is lying. You cannot call yourself a christian if you don't believe the bible. Believing that god and jesus exists isn't enough. You have to accept the entire story, not just part of it. I know that they have found many new things in modern science, and There are many more things to be known to man, but that doesn't mean it can't coexist with the rest of the bible. The dinosaurs were here before biblical times and a theory has been brought up about how god destroyed the dinosaurs and THEN created adam and eve along with the rest of the animals and plants to assist adam and eve to survive. There could have been creatures that were human-like before adam and eve were created and god based his creation on a certain type of animal or vise versa.

If you see a wild bull coming your way in the bullring you'd better run. This is how strong God's fighting power is.

There are two basic approaches: <br>  <br>  (1) Essentially literal translations seek the closest English words that correspond to the Greek and Hebrew, which the Scripture was originally written in.  Explanations of difficult verses are in study bible notes.  Translations using this philosophy read similarly.<br>  <br>  (2) Dynamic equivalent (DE) translations and paraphrases, seek to render the same general meaning and not be so concerned about the words used.  The priority is to improve readability.  Difficult words and verses are rephrased for modern reader. This means that figures of speech are dropped in favor of plain statements, shorter sentences are used, and simple vocabulary is employed. Since translators don’t always agree on the best way to rephrase for the modern reader, DE translations vary quite a bit from one another in some verses. <br>  <br>  Dynamic equivalence method was originally developed to help missionary translators.  It was thought to best for English also, but after a generation of reading DE translations, that thinking is hotly disputed by many scholars and pastors because many believe that too many details are lost in trying to improve readability.<br>  <br>  Both translation approaches offer some advantages. Therefore, there is benefit in using more than one Bible, at least one from each translation philosophy.  <br>  <br>  A book that explains the translation philosophy differences is “The Word of God in English” by Leland Ryken.  It is available as a free pdf here <a href="http://www.esv.org/translation/woge" rel="nofollow">http://www.esv.org/translation/woge</a><br>  A condense version of the WOGE is titled “Choosing a Bible: Understanding Bible<br>  Translation Differences <a href="http://static.crossway.org/excerpts/1581347308.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://static.crossway.org/excerpts/1581...</a><br>  <br>  Regarding differences between old translations and modern ones:<br>  <br>  The KJV was an excellent translation from the available manuscripts 400 years ago.  It has had a great impact on the spiritual lives of men and woman.  Its memorable phrases have become part of our language. The KJV deserves honor.<br>  <br>  Since the KJV was translated, better manuscripts have been discovered and archeological finds have improved the knowledge of the ancient languages and peoples.  Scholars have incorporated these improvements in the newer translations.|`|kt2i6eKXaa	well...the ones who were responsible for altering the book already knew there was no god. they do what they do to maintain social order within a society. creationists are more concerned w/ the moral ideas of their environment than a society's acceptance of a god. that's why they enforce the belief in a god. since everyone is human (equal), who gets to say what's moral (this is what they ask). so they come up w/ a god to be the "supreme" judge of all.
XN0cYCATaa	To some Muslims, the term "Son of God" brings up images of a sort of divine being with a goddess wife who together have somehow produced a child. When Christians use the term in reference to Jesus, they immediately assume that the Christians are committing blasphemy by stating that God has participated in some sort of sexual union with another god - a goddess wife.<br>  <br>  They say: "the most gracious has betaken a son!" Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous! At it in the skies are about to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, that they attributed a son to the Most Gracious, for it is not consonant with the majesty of the Most Gracious that he should beget a son. (The Qur'an, 5:88-92).<br>  <br>  This is naturally a ridiculous scenario and is a false assumption. No where in the Bible does it say that God had relations with anyone to produce a literal son, nor has Christianity taught that God produced a son through any physical act whatsoever. Such a thing is heretical. Nevertheless, the Bible in numerous places calls Jesus the Son of God. But, it does not mean that Jesus is the literal offspring of God.<br>  <br>  The Muslims need to as ask what does that term mean, in its historic and biblical context. Instead of imposing upon the biblical term a meaning that is foreign to it, the Muslim should learn what the Bible means by the term and think of it in the context as revealed in the Scriptures where it is used. To not do that would be the same as me taking a term out of the Qur'an, remove it from its Qur'anic context, and applying another meaning to it and then saying what the Qur'an teaches is false. The term ?'Son of God?' is used in different senses in the Bible. But, never does it mean that God has a wife and produces offspring.<br>  <br>  Old Testament usage of the term Son of God<br>  The term "son of God" is used in two main ways in the Old Testament. Neither way denotes any physical relation to God. Rather, the references deal with those who are under divine obedience to the call of God. It is used of Israel as a nation through the Exodus. Hosea 11:1 says, "When Israel was a youth I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son."1 It is also used in reference to angels. Job 1:6 says, "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them." Also, in Job 38:7 it says, "When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" These are in reference to angels who are created beings and in no way implies literal dependency from God.<br>  <br>  New Testament usage of the term Son of God<br>  The Term "Son of God" occurs 47 times in the King James New Testament. In reference to Jesus, it is a title as the heavenly, eternal Son who is equal to God the Father (John 5:18-24). It is Jesus who fully reveals the Father (Matt. 11:27). He is the exact representation of the Father (Heb. 1:1-3), He possesses all authority in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18), and Jesus had glory with the Father before the world was made (John 17:5).<br>  <br>  The Muslim is taught from the Qur'an and therefore cannot accept the fact that Jesus is divine. To the Muslim, that is shirk, blasphemy of the worst kind. But believing it doesn't make it so. To the Christian, and according to the Bible, Jesus is the one who alone saves us from our sins. We cannot earn our way to heaven, perform enough good works to please God, or ever be "sincere enough" in repentance to somehow obtain forgiveness from God. Instead, Christianity is a faith of God's great love and sacrifice for His creation. Jesus, the Son of God, is the divine one who fulfilled prophecies, walked on water, healed the sick, and rose from the dead. Only the Son of God can do these things.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	It is of the Muslim belief that Jesus never claimed that he was the son of God.

This sentence shows no sign of respect towards him as a scared figure, and so it is a great sin to talk about him in that manner.<br>  <br>  Secondly, we do believe that the bible was God's words sent to Prophet Jesus, however we still believe --with all our due respect to our fellow Christian brothers and sisters -- that the original scripture was corrupted big time. There has been many scientifical proofs for that which makes it impossible for an average mind to believe that such information could be God's true, perfect words. <br>  <br>  God, the Merciful, sent his messages in three steps to make it easier for the humankind to accept his rules and therefore make this world a better place, and a peaceful place. He started off with the Torah, then the Bible then finally the Quran.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, which goes back to he first point, we can never ever say that a prophet "had lied" or all that as it goes against our religious morales.|`|AuI0EW4Caa	You are almost correct as far as Muslims believe in the original Bible that was sent from God but they do not accept the Bible that you hold and use today as they believe it has been changed over time. Muslims also believe that Jesus is not a son of God because he never claimed to be a son of God. Here is what the Quran (Muslims Holy book)says concerning Jesus."It befits not the majesty of God that he should beget a son(this refers to the slandering of <br>  christians against God , by saying Jesus is the son of God) Glorified and Exalted be he above all that they associate with him. When he decrees a thing, He only says to it "Be" and it is. (Jesus said): "and verily God is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him(Alone). That is the straight path". Chapter 19 Verse: 35,36.  <br>  Hopefully, now you can see the difference and what Muslims actually believe. If you have more questions, you can look up your local Islamic center and call for more information.|`|mcmpooChaa	Muslims don't say Jesus lied. but Muslims say that bible has been distorted.

BQ0y50Nvaa	First, you are wrong about gender in French AND in Spanish. While most English words are pluralized in a regular way, the same can be said of German, or of every other language.<br>  <br>  German, however, has 3 genders. But it's not a rare feature, Russian, Icelandic and Greek also have that for instance. English used to.<br>  <br>  Languages evolve all the time, just like species do, and rules constantly, progressively and slowly shift. Genders did not spontaneously emerge, neither did plural, and we can trace back its origins. However, it's probably safe to assume that genders were probably associated with specific endings. It's still the case for some endings.<br>  <br>  When you learn a word, learn it in its Noun Phrase, namely with an article and an adjective, and do the same for its plural. This is not English were you can take words in isolation. To remember cases as well, you should also learn words in the context of a whole sentence.|`|mUK240ykaa	All Indo-European languages had those complex genders and plurals, and complex declensions in general, but most modern Germanic and Romance languages lost them in the last 600 to 700 years.

You know, when you're an atheist you have no presupposed idea about death, and since there's no evidence of anything because nobody has ever "come back" from the dead you have to admit to yourself that (at the very least) you don't know what's happening when you die.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that, since we were scattered matter before we were born, and nobody can really remember anything from before they were born (because nobody exists before existing) that's what death's going to feel like: nothingness, because we become that which we were in the beginning (before being born).<br>  <br>  Being this the case, and being that I can be sure of at least one thing: that I'm alive now, and that I will probably sill be tomorrow, I think you can't live life repressing your needs the way the christian belief systems say you should because it would mean probably missing out on your only shot for existence.<br>  <br>  Or at least that's as far as I've gone when thinking about death.

urIm4YaBaa	I've been studying philosophy for 9 years (closer to 10 years now that I think about it), and I focused on philosophy of religion for approximately 8 of those. This was both informal study on my own and time spent at Miami University of Ohio and at the University of Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  I glance at stuff streaming through philosophy of religion every once in a while, but it's a fairly slow subset of the field. Nothing particularly noteworthy has come out in a while, which is one of the reasons why my focus began to shift elsewhere.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Yes I have an it is a kind of an oxymoron and depends greatly upon who's version of philosophy , I mean really, Secular version from their point of view or from a spiritual biblical perspective|`|e04eb452209dd3002d2d0fa18bdf5cd5aa	LOL I have had studied both and economics as well...but I hate economics|`|QOlk2mFeaa	i did for 2 years in college and i sincerely wish i hadnt|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	I had dear...|`|vouUQQzBaa	Religion (Roman Catholic) -15 years<br>  Philosophy- 4 years<br>  <br>  Philosophy of Religion?

EO145XSDaa	yes! most of my friends are male and im female :)|`|smA22aNHaa	Yes I have always had more female than male friends.|`|AA10671142	of course, I have man men that are just friends to me|`|4uike3ARaa	Absolutely possible.<br>  Over the years, I've gained more than a few friends on the distaff side. Yes, there may be a bit of sexual interest, but that's easy to control. I value friendship more than sex.<br>  From 1977 to 1980, my 'room-mate' was a woman who is lesbian. We went out bar-hopping together, took vacations together, basically shared everything...except sex. 70's version of Will and Grace. Sometimes, a relationship is much easier to nourish when there isn't sexual tension involved.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Totally. I'm a girl and at least half of my close friends are boys. I'll admit that there were one or two where there was some sort of more-than-friends chemistry, but with the vast majority we're just friends and I wouldn't even think about them in any other way and I know they don't see me in any other way.|`|2g8m8USQaa	Absolutely. I have a number of male friends and one of them is my closest friend...and we are just friends. I believe that as long as things are straight from the get-go (you only want friendship and nothing further), then I don't see a problem.<br>  <br>  EMT|`|hVuPqHzsaa	I can not see a problem with that|`|AA10874030	Me and my friend (female) were talking about this the other night. She had a situation where she was really good friends with a man and they spent a lot of time together. She really enjoyed his company but the relationship was purely platonic. This went on for about 6 months and then it all transpired that he had wanted to be more than friends and actually tried to make a move on her one night. In my own experience of having male friends, it has never worked out. I have been quite happy to have male friends but it has always ended in a similar disaster. The worst was a man I was friends with right from when we were ten! I always got on well with him and eventually we wended up working together too. Often we would go out for drinks with our friends and he was a really funny guy! I found out after dating one of his friends, when we were 22 that he was in love me. Things have never been the same since and we hardly speak now. I've had other male friends but now I'm married they don't want anything to do with me - what does that say! I have another friend who met a man on her college course and he used to give her a lift home because they lived near by. They became friends and would occasionally text about the course work they had to do or go out for a drink after college. My friend knew he was married and wanted nothing more from him but his wife soon put a stop to their friendship and called my friend calling her all the names under the sun! I'm not saying men and women can't be friends, I know it does happen, but in my experiences its a mine field!|`|T1beLIQqaa	Only if one, the other, or both are gay or as long as they do not go out socially and limit it to non social contact.From my own experience-if I am a friend with a woman, it always means I am attracted to her. We remain friends only as long as we do not have social contact(going out for coffee after work, going to the gym, taking in a movie-begins to sound like dating, time to go to the next level-no longer friends). Once we cross the social line I, and, everyone of my male friends, is ready for more with the "woman friend".Honestly, I have no female friends that I am not attracted to-if they are my friends, I am attracted to them. Even my ex girlfriends-once we break up, we go our separate ways, if not, we end up doing booty call(not really an ideal relationship-even Elaine and Jerry on the Seinfeld Show have done this). The physical attraction between a man and woman is always in the way of such relationships.The biggest problem is MAINTAINING it in the friends mode. I have had a few female friends and ex girlfriends whom married some one else. This creates an understandably stressing situation as the spouse thinks his wife is fooling around with me-friendship gone. Incidentally, I have never had an affair with a married or separated woman, but there are plenty I would love to have an affair with-these, I remain as distant from as possible-yes, some I can see would be an easy mark as they take every opportunity to make contact with me, indicating they want me at least as much as I want them.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	Of course it is possible.  Humans are not solely driven by sex you know.<br>  Thinking about it - I have far more male friends than female ones - one of whom I would consider to be my closest friend.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Yes, I have a male friend but its not always easy. If the 'friend' is causing friction between partners I think it should be reconsidered.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Yes, I have had several male friends in my lifetime and still have them.|`|o01QtRwWaa	Of course. I'm female, and I have a lot of male friends who are really just friends.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	i would say that it's very hard if she is very attractive|`|4CebuvRhaa	It depends totally on mental tuning of the two and also what they both expects out of that particular relation...if they both remain clear about there feeling and respect each others too, have clear communication they can retain a healthy friendship...but when a opposite sex person becomes a friend many do at times develop a feeling which they think to be love...it may be it might not be...be vocal so that it becomes clear to both at the very onset so that it does not effect the friendship.<br>   I being from a profession which is male dominated have developed friendhip with people who are a very good companion.|`|BYE3eIdwaa	of course ... that is totally natural i get on great with guys doesnt mean anything is going to happen ... <br>  <br>  if my girlfriend had a girl as a friend who was also a lesbian i wouldn't mind that everyone is allowed friends|`|zgQZJUHwaa	Absolutely<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|cLdpKqxeaa	yes of course it is i have many female friends and i am happily married|`|UVbf33Wkaa	This is such a stupid question - gender doesn't make a difference.

BKbziUmjaa	Ha, that's an easy one: mankind did!<br>  <br>  First they created a whole bunch of Gods, to explain thunder and illness and other things they found strange. As more and more things could be rationally explained and man got a better understanding of the world, they reduced the Gods to just one, only used to "explain" abstract concepts such as 'the beginning', or 'the meaning of life'. But as you've discovered (judging by your question), God is a lousy explanation for these things; He begs more questions than he solves.<br>  <br>  Which is why a religious person could never answer your question. They can only say things like "God has always been there" or "God is the beginning and the end", and other things that have no actual, semantic meaning, other than being filler sentences for people who just really really want to believe in God, but cannot give you a descent answer.<br>  <br>  Which is why I feel for you: Believing in God but still asking questions, that is a troublesome path to go. You will get stuck in some irrational quicksand, until you come to the conclusion that there probably is no god, that is does not matter and that you can just go on with your life without all that stuff.  I just hope that day comes soon for you :)|`|5949961e52917ad56ba48b7335d2cf81aa	As you can't separate dance from dancer, sweetness from sugar similarly God is inseparable from His creation. Ultimate reality remains without any explanation as the intellect of common minds have yet to cross the limit conferred upon them. A wave that has been formed on the surface of an ocean may not be able to understand what is ocean during the tenure of its existence, yet it gets the option to merge into the ocean. The creation is a concept related to the finite part of human intelligences.|`|LsoHmtvIaa	My friend Why do you disagree that GOD just existed from nowhere.<br>  Just remain silent for some time and try to think of nothing, suddenly a thought will emerge in your mind.<br>  <br>  How do you explain this.

NO, no one is its creator, for it just exsisted.<br>  <br>  Try as many times you would like and I am sure you will get your answer|`|xPeIvywdaa	God is not natural as we are, He is eternal, He does not need a creator, He is there, always will be, always has been<br>  <br>  its probably hard for someone such as yourself to comprehend this who has only lived in the district of time|`|NiO0qTEzaa	This is a question that I have often pondered.<br>  <br>  In my views, God came about by himself, he was not created, per se.

Here is What William Blake says:<br>  <br>  The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects with Gods or Geniuses, calling them by the names and adorning them with the properties of woods, rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their enlarged & numerous senses could percieve.<br>  And particularly they studied the genius of each city & country, placing it under its mental deity;<br>  Till a system was formed, which some took advantage of & enslav'd the vulgar by attempting to realize or abstract the mental deities from their objects: thus began Priesthood;<br>  Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales.<br>  And at length they pronounc'd that the Gods had order'd such things.<br>  Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	There was no "who" before God.  God is eternal and needs no creator<br>  <br>  The universe does as everything in it does ONLY because the universe is made of space and time.  Without "time", cause and effect do not exist.

There is a huge philosophical problem with the idea of there being a creator at all, as it ALWAYS comes back to "who created the creator, then?"  The only answers that make any sense are that the universe has always been - which rules out a creator god - or that the universe could have Big Banged out of nothing, which quantum physics says it could have done, and again rules out a creator god.<br>  <br>  I don't rule out a god, but he has to be part of the creation, not the cause of it.|`|7sEFufRbaa	God is not in the category of things that are created, or come into existence, or are caused. God is uncaused and uncreated - He simply exists.<br>  <br>  We know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been existing. That ever-existing thing is what we call God.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	Your pastor apparently does not appreciate independent thought.  Perhaps you should give him what he wants, and depart his "flock."  You are correct that an always-existing God is not a satisfactory answer, but as far as I know, that's the only answer theists generally have to offer.  As for myself, I'm an agnostic; I doubt the reality of any god, and believe the correct answer for who created the idea of the various gods is quite simple:  people did.  That doesn't make their "invention" real, however.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	In order to begin to understand that we have to take our mind out of carnal thinking into spiritual thinking.  The only way I can sort of comprehend how God always was is when you think of the eternal and absolute concept of love and truth.  Love and truth always were love and truth.  Even when there were no creatures created to love or tell the truth, the absolutes always existed.  The bible says that God is love and Jesus said He is the truth.|`|nwQDMP2caa	Read revelations! <br>  <br>  "I am the Lord, the alpha and the omega, the begining and the end!" <br>  <br>  Don't doubt your faith man! <br>  You doubt your faith you have no faith!<br>  <br>  Also heres a seriously bad place to doubt it! more atheists here then rabits in australia!|`|2AqU4SjYaa	The same force / entity / power that created all the molecules of matter that atheists believe make up the known universe . . . . . <br>  <br>  I've never understood how it is is easier to believe that every molecule of matter JUST IS .. . and not only exists . . . but . . . for no reason .. . .starts moving, converging . . .because there is no gravity without heavenly bodies . . .

Why drag something on that will end badly. <br>  It's like an atheist getting involved with a hottie who's religious.<br>  Or a vegetarian getting involved with a meat eater. <br>  Or a pro lifer getting involved with someone who is pro-choice. <br>  These can become real obstacles and is it worth the constant irritant to be with that person.......<br>  Personally I do not feel it is a negative attitude or immature attitude, just a matter of strong taste. <br>  Some people can open their minds more and try to accept these new ideas but  if you consider the future, could you deal with her playing her taste in music in your apt, hanging pictures of Picasso (when you can't even stand him), or painting the walls forest green or chartreuse (when you can't stand these colors)-- it's the same idea.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Shallowness reaches new heights, make love to your ipod then.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	YESSSSSS i agreeeee|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	i love  classic  rock<br>  <br>  britney and  justin  and madonnahad  no place  in  my life<br>  <br>  i  always  thought  that  music  would  be THE big  factor  in  determining  whom  i  spent  my  years  with. <br>  <br>  ultimately  it  makes  no  difference.  my  guy  loves  all  the  stuff  i  hate and  it  doesnt  matter  thats  why  we  have  ipods. <br>  <br>  how  much  time  do you  need  to spend  listening  to  music  together anyway?.  <br>  <br>  my  bf  and  i watch  movies and  tv  together  and  we  love  the  same  type  of  movies  so  thats  our  together  time. <br>  <br>  i listen  to  my  music  at  work and  thats  plenty min  4 hrs  a day. <br>  <br>  you  can make  it  a  factor  if  you  want .  and  if  they insist  on  cranking  theirs  to  the  max  then  you  may  not  be  able  to  stand  it  but  music  is  just  not  a  big  enough factor  in my  guys  life  to  make  an  issue  out  of. he  respects  my  taste  and i respect  his. music  is  something  i  enjoy  in the  time  away  from him|`|4n77ayaQaa	You really should say that you cannot date someone who does not have the same taste in music as yourself.|`|VoQN7ADvaa	I'm really into music and listen to a little bit of everything so I consider myself horribly open-minded about music. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER<br>  <br>  I am unable to date people who listen to only a little bit of music or all one genre.

IHxcqYt5aa	Gay is the term used that denotes someone as a homosexual man, unless the gender is already specified. For instance, if I said that person is gay, the person I was talking to would look for a homosexual man. If I said that women is gay, however, it will mean the same as lesbian; the word is becoming common enough that it can almost be a non-gender specific word, but it is still generally accepted as the word for a male homosexual. Homosexual is the non-gender specific word to describe someone as liking the same sex.|`|w19Fm1RSaa	I think gay is the word, cuz if they mean gay women they would use the word lesbian each time, so gay more or less refers to men more than women.|`|I1qIoAmsaa	No, no specific term for men.

I mean no harm to you by saying this. Long before you were born God had a plan for all of us. The devil's involvement delayed God's plan for us but by no means has it changed. Whatever God sets out to do will become so. That is why his name is Jehovah. Because nothing can stop him. And the only reason why Jehovah allowed himself to be delayed is because he is a God of Justice. His sovereignty was challenged.

He has just finished a project, and you are fascinated by it. The object is beautifully made and intriguingly shaped. But try as you may, you cannot determine what it is for. How do you find out? Why, you simply ask your friend, and he will likely be happy to tell you.<br>  <br>  why not ask God, “the source of life”? (Psalm 36:9) How can you do that? Happily, he has spoken to us through the Bible. He has had individuals of faith write down his thoughts in a way that we can understand. Actually, the purpose of life can be expressed in just a few words: We are here to learn about God and to do his will. The Bible says: “The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man.”—Ecclesiastes 12:13.<br>  <br>  Learning what God originally intended for mankind will help you better understand the purpose of life. It will also explain why some of the things mentioned in the previous article bring a measure of meaning and purpose to the lives of many today.<br>  <br>  The Bible account of man’s creation says: “God went on to say: ‘Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.’” (Genesis 1:26) Thus, humans were made with the potential for being like God, possessing the outstanding qualities he has, including wisdom, power, righteousness, and love<br>  <br>  As we study the Bible, it is evident that God intended for Adam’s family to grow and for him and his children to extend the boundaries of the garden of Eden until humans filled the entire earth. And the subdued earth would be a paradise. True, man would use the riches of the earth for his own benefit. But this would be done in a responsible way. Man was to be a steward of the earth, not a despoiler of it. The destruction of the earth that we witness today is against God’s will, and those who share in it are going contrary to the purpose of life.—Revelation 11:18.<br>  <br>  We learn something else from the early Bible record, and that is that it was not God’s purpose for people to die. Our first parents died only because they disobeyed God. (Genesis 2:16, 17) When they disobeyed, they were no longer fulfilling the purpose of life—they were no longer doing God’s will. So not only did they die but all their offspring have also been subjected to death because of inheriting imperfection from them. (Romans 5:12) Humans were, however, originally intended to live forever, not to die. This is likely why many find it frustrating to contemplate the cutting short of their life’s work by death.<br>  <br>  God’s original purpose for humankind and this earth has not changed. He still intends to have a paradise earth peopled by a perfect human race. Yet, he has had to make arrangements to overcome the sad effects of the failure of our first parents. Doing God’s will today involves acting in harmony with all these arrangements of God. Happily, the Bible provides a description of the progressive fulfillment of his purpose.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus was resurrected as an immortal spirit creature and is now ruling as King of God’s heavenly Kingdom. Soon that Kingdom will act to replace the present earthly governments with a new world society that will take over the management of human affairs. A Bible prophecy promises: “The kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”—Daniel 2:44.<br>  <br>  Afterward, this Kingdom will oversee the delightful activity of restoring Paradise to the earth and raising humankind to perfection. The Bible even speaks of a resurrection of the dead, so that they too can have the opportunity to share in the fulfillment of God’s grand purpose for mankind. (Acts 24:15) Then will be fulfilled the beautiful promise: “The meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”—Psalm 37:11, 29.<br>  <br>  To benefit personally from the fulfillment of God’s grand purpose for the earth, we must first get to know God. Jesus Christ said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) How can we do that? We learn some things about God by observing the world around us, the creation, including the starry heavens. (Psalm 19:1) Especially, though, do we learn about God—as well as about his Son, Jesus Christ—through the Bible. We learn his name and his qualities, and we find out in detail what God has done for mankind. Such knowledge makes us love him and draws us very close to him and to his Son.<br>  <br>  Getting to know God makes us want to do his will. Perhaps we have prayed as Jesus instructed: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 6:10) The real purpose of life—the one that brings true sat|`|RRixTVskaa	God will never do anything without a good and fulfilling purpose for you, you sometimes may not see what God has in store for you, and waiting is just the matter of time to grow as a Christian and to see what you need to fulfill in your life. Getting close to God is by just trusting him and having faith (praying), don't worry on what tomorrow will hold, just have faith and God will lead you to the right path. And maybe for the reason for the wait is just God's way to prepare you for your fulfillment, and soon you will have a purpose, just take your time to grow as a Christian, and most importantly have FAITH.|`|4rDBAlg6aa	God has planned out your whole life, He did this before the beginning of the world.

D6m85oHoaa	Defining culture is no easy task because it means many different things to many people. There are easily as many definitions of ‘culture’ as the number of cultures in the world! Culture to some people is part of social behavior, to others it is things such as artifacts, dance, music, theatre, and fashion constitute culture; and yet others believe that no object can be culture.<br>  Its important to strive to constantly increase our effectiveness through monitoring and facilitated learning about and encouraging various traditions that hold good in today's time. We need to work with local partners and find culturally appropriate means to strengthen societies' capacity to deal with conflicts constructively: to understand the differences and act on the commonalities. <br>  You have to cause a fundamental shift in people's relationship with conflict - away from adversarial approaches toward cooperative solutions and create new possibilities of peaceful coexistence, drawing upon the strengths of diversity and interconnectedness. People who become aware of the approach can begin to apply the principles and key practices immediately in their lives.  <br>  Cultural diversity must be preserved and promoted, as the lack of knowledge, appreciation and understanding of other cultures often causes conflict and hate between people. One threat to cultural diversity is cultural imperialism where, in an era of globalization, one dominant culture overpowers others and is seen as advanced and superior. <br>  There isn't a method for causing conflicts to transform instantaneously - it is not something you can achieve in a single event or by signing a peace accord - it is an on-going process of developing relationships of mutual respect and trust. Every peace process has its ups and downs. Making long-term commitments allows us to keep working on the underlying causes of a conflict even during periods of increased intensity. <br>  Another concern is regional cultural imperialism. This is happening the most in Asia, where the Koreans are concerned about the spread of Japanese culture, and people in Hong Kong are being influenced by both Korean and Japanese culture. Many people are afraid that these trends will eventually lead to cultural homogenization.<br>  Sometimes when cultural groups feel threatened by cultural imperialism, they may use the defense of culture and tradition to validate practices that negatively privilege one group over another within a group. For example, women who object to the unequal treatment that they are subjected to in their religious or ethnic groups are punished symbolically or with force for importing Western “ideas". <br>  Look for problem solvers and creative thinkers who, from a shared vision, can develop finite and achievable projects. Continuously develop new tools and approaches. Work with and build on individuals' and communities' knowledge, wisdom and creativity. Partner with local peace builders to strengthen their ability to transform their own conflicts. The difference will be seen probably not by you but by your followers owing to the decades slipping away in this quest.

AA10834046	María Eva Duarte de Perón (7 May 1919 – 26 July 1952) was the second wife of President Juan Domingo Perón (1895–1974) and served as the First Lady of Argentina from 1946 until her death in 1952. She is often referred to as simply Eva Perón, or by the affectionate Spanish language diminutive Evita, which literally translates into English as "Little Eva".<br>  <br>  She was born out of wedlock in rural Argentina in 1919. In 1934, at the age of 15, she made her way to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires, where she pursued a career as a stage, radio, and film actress. Eva met Colonel Juan Perón in 1944 at a charity event in San Juan, and the two were married the following year. In 1946, Juan Perón was elected President of Argentina. Over the course of the next six years, Eva Perón became powerful within the Pro-Peronist trade unions, essentially for speaking on behalf of labor rights. At that time, women in Argentina had no civil rights, so she couldn't be minister during Perón Administration; that's why she founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina which was recognized in 1947, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party.<br>  <br>  In 1951, Eva Perón accepted the Peronist nomination for the office of Vice President of Argentina. In this bid, she received great support from the Peronist political base, low-income and working class Argentines who were referred to as descamisados or "shirtless ones". However, opposition from the nation's military and elite, coupled with her declining health, ultimately forced her to withdraw her candidacy. In 1952 shortly before her death from cancer at the age of 33, Eva Perón was given the official title of "Spiritual Leader of the Nation" by the Argentine Congress.

206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	John 8:58<br>  "Before Abraham ever was.......I Am"<br>  <br>  Those are the words of Jesus.......and He is clearly referring to Himself as the great I Am there. <br>  <br>  "I Am" or YHVH is known as the tetragramatton.....or the unspeakable name of the Lord. Jesus used it to describe Himself....which is why the Pharisees took up stones to stone Him after He said it.<br>  <br>  Jesus, at no time ever separated Himself from Deity. He was true God but man at the same time. He had to be made like His brethren in order to fulfill the sacrafice (atonement) for sin|`|AA11849917	Jesus said that you can ONLY know God, through Him, Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Jesus said that He did ONLY what He saw His Father in heaven do. (No man has seen God at any time, yet Jesus SEES God and copies His behaviors, so Jesus must be something MORE than a mere man, since no MAN has seen God.) He KNEW God. He even said that He came from the very HEART of God, so He could say objectively, "When you've seen ME, you've seen the Father."<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Jesus said "I am Truth." Was Jesus telling the truth when He said that? Or was He a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "I am Life", and again, "I am the bread of Life that has come down from My Father in heaven to give Life.", and again, "I am the water of life. Whoever is thirsty, come to me, and out of his inner-most being shall flow rivers of living waters", and finally, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. If any man believe in me, though he may die, yet shall he live again."<br>  <br>  He said, "You already believe in God, now believe in me."<br>  <br>  In his famous book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis makes this statement, "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us."|`|332vXA6oaa	Jehovah is the God of Jesus John 20:17 and Revelation 3:14|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Get one thing correct, Jesus is the Son of God Luke 23:34: Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."<br>  <br>  Somoneone mentioned about Jesus and muslims. Some people like Muslims try to limit who God is saying ''God cant possibly have a Son'' well for goodnesssake God is God He can have whatever he wishes. Son or no Son. God gave man the ability to have kids so why cant God I wonder. Some Muslims make silly excuses and reasons to try and justfiy what they dont know.<br>  <br>  Is the fact that God has a Son ,who did wonders in His Fathers name to help people, to help themselves, a good enough reason to say 'Jesus can't be the Son of God' I think not.<br>  <br>  Religious or not most people know that Muhammad, the founder of Islam and supposedly the last of God's prophets, performed no miracles. Jesus Christ the true Son of God and seal of all God's prophets performed many miracles - proving His claims to divinity. The God of the Bible performs miracles. The God of Islam is unconcerned with the human condition and has never miraculously demonstrated a loving concern for individuals.|`|AA11097612	Jesus also said, 'I and my Father are one."  He claimed to be God.  In the beginning of the Gospel of John it says, 'In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God."  <br>  <br>  Choose to believe that Jesus was a mad man who was out of His mind for claiming to be God or choose to believe He was an evil liar willing to deceive men and women to follow Him to their death all for a lie; or choose to believe that He is Who He claimed to be: Jesus, the Christ, the Lord and Savior, God.<br>  <br>  The best way for me to explain the Trinity is something found in nature called the triple point.  H2O, as everyone knows, exists as ice, water or steam depending on the temperature and the atmospheric pressure which can be easily put onto a graph.  There is a place where these lines of pressure and temperature intersect and H2O co-exists as ice, water and steam all at the same time.  It is called the "triple point".  <br>  <br>  The Father, Jesus the Christ and the Holy Spirit are all equaly one God.|`|NLinPsyhaa	One God identified in three persons.

We are told in many places of the HOLY SPIRIT and of the SON who was sent.  We may also read of the MESSIAH who was coming throughout the Old Testament (and Talmud).

Read the New Testament carefully.|`|G2yUpoqfaa	The Arians, from these words, pretended that the Father only is the true God.  It is the Arian heresy, and it still exists today in the heretical sects of Buddhism, Jehovah Witnesses, Islam, and others.  It is condemned. <br>  <br>  Scripture must be read comparatively with the other texts in order to gain the sense of a single sentence, which could be misleading as you suggest above.<br>  <br>  Jesus, here, speaks of Himself as made man, in His human nature, not in His divine nature as the Redeemer of Mankind.  St. Augustine answers, that the sense and construction is: that they may know Thee, and also Jesus Christ thy Son, whom thou hast sent to be the only true God.  St. Chrysostom states the sense is "that the Father is here called true God, not to exclude the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are the same one true God with the Father, but only to exclude the false gods of the Gentiles.   The son of God, Jesus Christ, is expressly called the true God, even within the Greek Orthodox (non-Catholic sect) article, upon which they commonly lay so much stress.  Later, the Greeks decided that there is no Third Person, the Holy Ghost, in spite of what St. Chrysostom, the Eastern Doctor of the Catholic Church, has taught them. This is the predominant reason that the Greek Orthodox are still, today, a heretical church.|`|X6xa3ZNmaa	Jesus didn't say it, someone wrote that he said it, and someone translated that, and than someone edited to modern day thingy... as far i know , he didn't say it, but someone wrote it.|`|rIvp1BToaa	one  verse  of  many  many time s he  said  he was  god  he is one  with the Father.  you need to read the whole  Gospel  to get the whole story and the verses in context.|`|b30632dc722205bf91353bbc7a7158acaa	John 10:30<br>  John 14:6<br>  <><|`|zp7aW6o7aa	He did, and still does today.  He spoke in Parables, so those who love the world over truth would be blinded to Gods truth.<br>  <br>  Why do you think there are so many religions that believe and pray to men who God made as Prophets to share Gods words with them.  Moses was an example;  His own people saw and witnessed the power of God, but as soon as Moses was gone for any length of time, they built a golden calf and worshiped it.<br>  <br>  Same as after Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection.  All the miracles he did, through God and his own resurrection by the hand of God and yet, man believes Christ resurrected himself.  Man has forgotten the first commandment and made Jesus a God.  "Thou shalt have no other God before me."<br>  <br>  Also something else for you to ponder on.  Isaiah 43;  10,11.  Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br>       I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.<br>  <br>  So for all those who think Jesus died as the worlds saviour, are wrong.  Christ's resurrection is and always was his calling.  His resurrection is the worlds testimony of the power of God.  Jesus was a witness to the Father as all Prophets of God are.<br>  <br>  Yet, while alive these prophets are hated and killed, yet in death, they are reverened and worshipped.  How backwards this world truly is.<br>  <br>  Prophets walk the earth today, but are not known of by the world, for the time coming upon us has never been seen by the eyes of man in the history of this planet.  The difference is that when they reveal themselves to the world, they shall not be killed, for they shall carry the power of God with them to protect Gods chosen from the wrath of God, and the evil that will unveil itself in the days, before the coming of Christ.<br>  <br>  The two prophets prophesized about in the book of revelations are not two separate men.  But two countries.  Israel and America.  The leadership  of our country today, shall put America as hated as Israel is, and both shall fall, but only through the love of God shall they arise again, but only those left behind, shall be Gods righteous who shall never be taken from the earth.  Evil shall be disposed of by the angels of God, as Jesus discribed in St. Matthews, 13;  41-43 & 47-50.  Yet many will not believe for the follow the false prophets of our times.

If we were created from some huge chunk of divine clay, then God can reclaim that clay from us whenever It sees fit to do so.<br>  <br>  It would seem wrong for a truly loving God as sometimes depicted by various religions to not allow some manner of access to It.  Whether through our eyes, seeing a cute baby squirming, our ears hearing a babbling brook and breeze ruffling through pine needles on a beautiful spring day, our mouths in the form of jalapenos and cheese exploding with flavor, our senses seem to allow us to experience spectacular things.  Are these manifestations of God?  If God did create all things, then yes, we have intimate access to God.<br>  <br>  I tend to think of access, however, more like an exchange of information, not just a one-way deal.  Ideally I would access God on an as-needed basis, to ask questions and obtain knowledge.  If I wanted to be really egocentric I'd hit up God all the time for insider trading-style tips on how to run my life, how to avoid tragedy, how to have a wonderful life.  <br>  <br>  Of course, life is far from ideal, we make do with what we have and learn along the way.  That is part of why I think although we may have access, we don't know the scope let alone the nature of what it is we actually have access to.  We may learn over time, but some of the mysteries may never be solved, at least in our lifetimes.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	your religion does matter<br>  remember when it says about the people saying "lord, lord! did we not do blah blah etc etc in your name?" and he rejects them - this is because they weren't serving him properly - doing part of the things right but not all<br>  many religions have completely contrasting views - all roads DO NOT lead to Rome in the case of religion<br>  if you believe in hell and it doesn't exist, you are wrong<br>  if you belive in the Trinity and it doesn't exist, you are wrong<br>  <br>  as i have said before - people use this as an excuse and a substitute for thinking<br>  yeah, sure its controversial - but you'll never attain to truth if you reel off rubbish that it doesn't matter what you believe<br>  maybe thats why truth is so hard to find nowadays...|`|4OEOxOmPaa	I don't know about 'access', but as a Deist/Pantheist, I believe in a universal God that doesn't care if you call it Jesus, Allah, Deescalate or Zeus etc. He/She/It would judge you on how good of a person you were/are.|`|dDprsKZYaa	Yes. <br>  We have access to God, fairies, unicorns, honest politicians and all manner of imaginary beings.|`|qpjorXRnaa	Access? yes, now salvation, no!

We all have access to God when we pray, but there is only One True God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob whose Son is Jesus the Christ, our Lord, Savior and God.  God will listen to an unbeliever, but God set the law that the only way to Him and eternal life is by Jesus the Christ that God sent.  Without Jesus, there is no hope of eternal life.  Without Jesus, you are lost in your sins because without the shedding of Jesus' blood there was no remission of sin.  Therefore, without Jesus you have no hope of eternal life with God.  From Genesis to Revelation in God's Holy Bible it is all about Jesus the Christ, the Branch that God sent.  Jesus said, "If you've seen Me, you've seen the Father."  Jesus said, "I and the Father are One."  The only way man has ever seen God is to have seen Jesus when He walked the earth as God in human flesh.<br>  <br>  If you are asking if false religion believers and atheists have a chance at heaven, then the answer is NO.  Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven.  God set the laws for nature and God set the laws for mankind.<br>  Without faith, it is impossible to please God.  You must believe that God is who He says He is.  God set the laws - not man.  You can't get around God's laws.  Jesus even said, that He didn't come to bring peace but a sword.  That He would set wife against husband, brother against sister.  Jesus meant one would believe in Him and the other would not.  Jesus even said, "how can two walk together except they agree."  I believe Jesus and I have no association with atheists and false religion except to tell them about Jesus.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	no one comes to the Father but by me(Jesus),<br>  that is what He said so if you don't have Jesus you can't get to the Father.<br>  everyone has a choice to make but it is through Jesus that we get access to the Father.<br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	We are all God's creation and God makes the rain to fall and the sun to shine on all people, good and evil.

There will be a chance in tribulation to turn this around, but even then most will not do so.<br>  <br>   With the knowledge of the percents around the world of how many people are Christians; which is 33% of the world is Christians then I would have to say only 33% of the world will be going to Heaven unless we begin witnessing and doing our job as Christians and followers of the one true GOD.<br>  <br>  As of today if the Jesus came to carry us home it would be 33% according to research of how many people in the world actually believe in GOD.

God gives thousands and thousands and MILLIONS and TRILLIONS of chances for people to believe (through the bible, through Christian witnesses, through books and movies, through miracles and life experiences, etc.) so if they don't believe by the time the bell tolls, well, what's God supposed to do about it? As he is to be a fair and just God. <br>  <br>  However, I hope I'm wrong on the above "theory" and that God actually ends up saving 2/3 of humanity and only condemns 1/3, that would be so much better. <br>  <br>  But as a Christian, I know that many people will go to hell who don't believe and it breaks my heart. I hope I can save as many people while I can, while I'm still here on this Earth. In fact, that is my sole mission in life. <br>  <br>  But I'd say somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3, probably, although alot of people seem to think 1/4.|`|PWankIUpaa	I believe it says in Daniel or Revelation that about one fourth  however I have not read that passage in a while.<br>  Dr. Tim La haye gives this in his Left Behind series and is a fun way to find out.<br>  <br>  Go to oneplace.com and click on the dramatized series and learn the prophecy through a very interesting story designed to teach you the prophecy of God!|`|AA12187900	Only 144,000 faithful humans were chosen by God to co rule in heaven with his Son, Christ Jesus.

lHoDOF6Daa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  What we should be CERTAIN about is what the bible CLEARLY teaches about Jesus:<br>  <br>  1. He is the son of God.<br>  2. He is the messiah (Christ)<br>  3. He lived a sinless life<br>  4. He was resurrected & now sits at the right hand of God.<br>  <br>  Is Jesus God? The bible certainly doesn't say that. There are a few verses which seem like they are perhaps making that claim, however, upon closer inspection of the original Greek, or the actual context, and it is clear Jesus is not God.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Jesus didn't say "I am God"?  What do you call accepting worship?  Forgiving sins?  Taking authority over the Laws of nature?  Taking authority over death - for others and for Himself?  If He was just a man, how could His death make salvation available to the entire human race?  If you really did stick with the Bible, you would believe that whatsoever His Church binds upon earth is bound in heaven; and that the Holy Spirit guides His church into all truth; and that anyone who listens to His Church is listening to Him.  And so you would know that the divinity of Christ is binding teaching of His church, and is therefore bound in heaven, and therefore has a divine guarantee of truth.  Believing in Jesus means believing the truth about Him, not just believing "something" about Him.|`|AA12203324	I'll try to keep it brief.  Back in the Second and Third Centuries, when it looked like Jesus was taking his time coming back, Christians decided they could take the time to ponder just what Jesus was.  The term "Son of God" is problematic.  If he's literally the genetic offspring of God, what does that mean?  Is he a second God?  What happens to monotheism then?  Was he "adopted" by God?  In that case, how is his sacrifice any more meritorious than any other martyr?  If he's some special, in-between category, exactly what does he have in common with either God OR us?<br>  <br>  There were all kinds of opinions about what Jesus was: God pretending to be human, a human pretending to be God, two separate beings trapped in the same body, and much more.  "What" Jesus was affected the nature and meaning of his sacrifice.  And theologians, bishops and their fans literally fought in the streets of larger cities for their point of view, forcing losing leaders to leave town.<br>  <br>  That's one of the reasons Constantine legalized Christianity, it was becoming hard to ignore and he wanted it to sort out its beliefs and settle down.  A series of councils settled the issues.  Jesus was a single being with two "natures", a human one that qualified him to represent humanity, and a divine one that made his sacrifice sufficiently meritorious to forgive the world's sins.  And to settle the relationship between Jesus and the Father, they determined that they (and the Spirit) were all the same, one God, but three "persons".<br>  <br>  Naturally there were some sore losers, who were branded heretics and were either forced to recant, go underground or even die.  Christianity needed to have a consistent doctrine or it would in time become whatever anyone wanted it to be and it would become undefinable and meaningless.<br>  <br>  If Jesus isn't God, then he's just some kind of philosopher.  He had some good ideas but that isn't a faith. It doesn't require a belief in God.  The Bible really isn't all that clear about what Jesus was.  But then, there ARE those "verses in John" that can only be reinterpreted with a lot of straining.  On the other hand, Paul says he was "raised" BY God (passive), suggesting he was nothing more than a man.  If you don't define "Son of God", it become meaningless.  It's hard to fall back on the Bible when the Bible doesn't take a clear stand.  You might as well throw those verses out, which I'm sure you wouldn't want to do, but why not?  The canon of the Bible was chosen by human beings (guided by the Spirit, of course), but there are issues that the Bible simply cannot or does not address.  Declaring them unimportant doesn't make them go away.  Decisions have consequences, as do non-decisions.<br>  <br>  Doctrines are like walls.  Intended to define a theological territory, they often serve to keep people out as much as in.  But without them, how are disagreements settled?  How is confusion avoided?  If Jesus isn't clearly defined, what exactly does believing in him mean?  Would it be any different than believing in Isaac Newton?  Or Mozart?

MEny7pBHaa	it is like trying to keep the waves from reaching the shore. paul spoke deeply about this because it is important. there is a path to victory and your faith is required. we being spritually changed forever (saved by grace) are secure from the judgment of sin, meaning whatever we do God will no longer hold sin against us because we acknowledge His Son's payment on our behalf. but we keep sinning though we don't want to. paul said the flesh is at war with the spirit and the spirit is at war with the flesh, so your old nature keeps prompting you to do what the new nature does not want you to do. <br>  <br>  it is important that we understand we ourselves cannot defeat a sin, if you could then you would have no need for a Savior. anyone trying to live a sinless life is spitting in God's face and treading upon His holy blood. but God did not save us so we might return to our oppressors. understand that the flesh is the last stronghold of sin, the Spirit of God has moved in and the devil does not have warrant over you any longer. here is how we defeat temptation... the control of the thought life. God created us so we cannot think two thoughts at one time. if your mind is on heavenly things, it will not be on anything else. therefore the next time you are tempted place the thought on a balance and place God's word on the other, and measure the value of your options. literally bring what God says (His thoughts) into your own thoughts, and you'll cast out sin left and right. but understand the devil will never stop trying until your flesh is dead... so you should never lose your meekness lest you fall into temptation and backslide. this is the race, the good fight, and at the end of life there are crowns aplenty to be won for God.|`|edzU8VJiaa	Whoa there a minute!

When I was nominated for and won the "Volunteer of the Year" award in our small town there was a banquet in my honor. They had a lovely dinner where they awarded me with flowers and a very nice plaque. Our small town newspaper had an article in it about me receiving the award in the following week's edition.  Now mind you, small town newspapers are not always known for proofreading their stories. There was a picture of me that had a caption that read "The Lady of the Evening". Of course, it never dawned on anyone that this is a slang term used to refer to a prostitute.

If it ever ceases to happen it will be a sad day.  I never want to become so serious or self-conscious that I cannot or will not find humor in my own foibles. <br>    On the first day on a new job I walked through a mans garage and stepped on some boards forming a floor and did not realize that it was a cover over his cess pool. Yep, a board broke and I shoved my foot and my leg down into the cess pool until I was sitting on  that cover. I am six foot five and that means that I had an awful lot of leg down in the do-do. I called my office and told them that I would be awhile before I returned because I had to go home and bathe and change clothes.

And I am not kidding.  Anyway, as we were trying to get everything hooked up, I did not realize that my husband had moved the chair that I sit in when I use my computer.  I decided that I would sit down for a minute.  As I went to sit, I suddenly realized the chair was gone - to late - so on my way down to the floor, I grabbed the closest thing to me, which was my husband's legs.  Down we both went, him hollering Hey - what's wrong with you?  There we were, both on the floor, computer wires and all.  After the initial shock, we both began to laugh our heads off.  It was quite something, two senior citizens sitting there on the floor, computer parts surrounding us, laughing like crazy.

Three neighbor friends on my sofa, on the long wall of the living room, kitchen at one end, patio door at the other.  It's time to feed the rabbit.  All four of us are laughing about a party we'd had.  I open the glass sliding door and the screen, squat and open the cage door at the patio end.  Get the food and water bowls, come in and think about whether to close the screen.  Decide yes; it's summer, might be mosquitoes.  Start listening again, get engaged and tickled again, wash the bowls and refill them, walk through the living room with them, straight through the screen door.  It goes SPLAT on the concrete.  How we'd been laughing was nothing now, compared to this.  All I could think of was Charlie Chan.  If I looked like a fool I might as well do it up all the way.  So I did a Charlie Chan double-take and shrug, and put the bowls back in the cage, but by then I'd cracked myself up too, so we were four again, laughing.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Yours is the funniest thing I have ever read.

I was starting to laugh by then and I told her I was not going back and I certainly was not going to run over it again! We were laughing so hard be then that I had to stop the car. She was still insisting I go back and slapping at me. The floor mat had slid up under the accelerator so I though since we were stopped I would straighten it out. I opened the door and turned to swing my feet and legs out and staring at me through the window of my door was the biggest dog I have ever seen in my life right there up to the window. It was on all fours and almost eye to eye with me. I screamed, slammed the door and locked it and took off up the road. We started laughing hysterically by then and I had to stop the car again. My friend who had seen the dog thank God said, " You know dogs can't open car doors. Why did you lock it? I said, "Dog _ell, I thought it was the raccoon coming to get me."

In other words, you are on the Satan side of the ledger (no offence meant) already.  What you have read about God and Israel is that God was cleaning up the land of the cities where people we involved in devil worship, cannibalism, offering their women and children as human sacrifices to their pagan gods.  God was not just completing an exercise in "ethnic cleansing"  but was putting these people out of their collective miseries.  It can be compared to the allied troops of WW II marching against the Nazis and their death camps.  When you are dealing with the Old Testament, you are reading about God, who is establishing a model nation, Israel, to carry His name before the rest of the region and nations therein.  This is why God gave them [Israel] all those laws etc. and punished them for disobedience.  Remember too; God has the power to give life back to these pagan nations too and He will, later (Read the New Testament).  <br>    God is working out a plan commencing with the Israelites (commencing within the Old Testament of the Bible) and concluding this Plan with the Gentile nations and eventually the Jews [Israel] at the return of Jesus Christ, later.  Christians are those composed of both, SOME  Jews and Gentiles, being prepared now, for that time of Christ's return to earth.  By the way; things seldom are the way they SEEM to be.  Especially; when it comes to God !|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	sorry double g just said god kills people when their evil lol ridiculas im gobsmacked ,,i feel sorry for anyone that had their kids or loved ones killed to have to hear that rubbish,,how dare he? this is the **** that turns people away from christianity these jerks,,if anyone should be punished its them for turning people away from god,,i totally agree god does seem more evil ,,someone said recently god is uncapable of having feelings as he has never lived thats why he sent jesus so he could tell him what its like ,,what utter sh@t,,jesus must have loved being tortured and recemended it for the rest of us ,,,blah gimme a break|`|EYbh3ldhaa	hahaha, you're hilarious.<br>  <br>  and if this isn't a joke, you're pathetic and ridiculously stupid.<br>  <br>  I'm worried :/|`|Ac3Z0RLuaa	No. <br>  well, do what you want<br>  <br>  but you should understand that God cannot hate us. <br>  God is loving and caring, why else would he use all his power to create us and earth? he could have just stayed by himself for eternity.|`|FIeiGIobaa	Wow, I totally agree with everything you just said.|`|519Cs3Tyaa	Im so disgusted right now i can t believe im even wasting my time on this :(|`|gf3CCvuUaa	Well, if you're believing that God is evil, then you believe that there is God.

For example, Roger Williams of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the late 1600's felt that the Native American's were far more civilized than Europeans, except that they did not accept Christ (they had a big hang-up about that sort of thing back then).<br>  <br>  I think that when people spoke of "Civilization" back then they are referring to three primary things: technology, European social norms, and Christianity. While Native Americans, as a whole, had a great deal of technological advancements they, sadly, did not come close to the Europeans in the weapons (i.e. canons/guns), transportation (i.e. HUGE ships and sophisticated wagons), or establishment (i.e. churches, city centers, and homes) areas. This is not to say that they were somehow uncouth, but it would suggest similarities to a modern day American Indians on computers judging South Americans living in the jungles: they are to be respected but they do not "know" as much as the modern day Native American.<br>  <br>  Also, Native Americans were not the only people subjected to European social norms - just ask the Africans, Egyptians, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolians, South Americans, Australian Aborigines, and Hawaiians (just to name a few off the top of my head). All the whites saw were people running around half naked - they never took the time to see the true beauty of a civilization fully dependent on no one but themselves. Able to sustain themselves and their families without nearly as much greed they were seen as savages. It's disgusting, really, that Natives were judged in this way.<br>  <br>  Finally, early settlers of America honestly believed that they were going to America to help the Natives, if you can believe that. They thought that the Natives needed their help and would welcome them as liberators from debauchery. Sound familiar? It should - it's apparently the current American policy. Apparently it is up to us to travel to distant lands and convert the natives - either to Christianity or Democracy, we don't seem to care.<br>  <br>  I may have rambled a bit there but I hope I provided an answer to your question.|`|7sgJuukQaa	Yeah, it's people making Anglo Saxon or European life-style the standard......we have every ethnic group that comes to the United States trying to emulate the Anglo way........now I'm not racist I'm just against people having to assimilate to a society in order to be accepted. We should be able to function within a free society and still stay connected with our cultural beliefs without being called Uncivilized. They did it us (Native Americans), the Blacks (slavery)...and Asians (indentured workers)|`|s7pqFa1eaa	That is a political term used by western Europeans to describe groups of people who do not live like western Europeans.

For that matter, the Muslims do acknowledge what is commonly referred to as the Old Testament.  <br>  The Mormons recognize Jesus as well, although, like Islam, the story doesn't end there for them.  Both Mormons and Muslims recognize revealed scripture above and beyond the New Testament.|`|rXGiN15Vaa	OK, I've read the Book of Mormon many times and sections of the Koran, and Jesus Christ is in both. After all, the full title of the Book of Mormon adds "Another Testament of Jesus Christ". The Book of Mormon views Christ as mainstream Christianity does: as Lord and Savior of all mankind. The Koran also mentions Christ. They believe that he was a great prophet, but don't include the Son of God or the Atonement doctrines taught in Christianity. I know they greatly respect Him, but I'm not quite sure to what extent. That's better answered by a Muslim. Cheers!|`|2rCZbaEIaa	yes, I can't point our where  (its been a long long time since Ive even looked at the Koran, or Book of Mormon)<br>  I believe that Muslims look at Jesus as a prophet (but not messiah)<br>  And Mormons def believe and pray to Jesus,  (last I checked Mormonism is a branch of radical Christianity just as Quakerism is)<br>  <br>  Jesus is NOT mentioned in the Jewish Torah but is refferanced to in other ancient texts as a false prophet.

Therefore what you think, what I think , what anyone thinks,  even if we call ourselves by the same denomination as they are,  doesn't matter, because "they don't believe in THAT" -- so they can merely separate themselves from any mistakes, heresy, or damaging evidence.<br>  <br>  Catholics can't abandon their followers like that and because supposedly all Catholics think and act the same,  they are a much easier target. <br>  <br>  <br>  So I doubt any Fundies will even answer to this, because that 1 church isn't THEIR church,  isn't what THEY believe.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Interesting video.|`|K3PR7Mivaa	I worship only Jesus!<br>  man is just that man...full of error mistakes and lies...<br>  Jesus is truth love and Life <br>  GWB is just a man|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I watched about 5 seconds of that; that was all I could take!  *ugh*
6Q4xh4F1aa	Here is what they teach about salvation:<br>  <br>  "Make haste to identify the visible theocratic organization of God that represents his king, Jesus Christ. It is essential for life. Doing so, be complete in accepting its every aspect." (Watchtower, October 1, 1967, p. 591) <br>  <br>  To receive everlasting life in the earthly Paradise we must identify that organization and serve God as part of it. (Watchtower; Feb. 15, 1983; p. 12)<br>  <br>  <br>  "Your attitude toward the wheat like anointed 'brothers' of Christ and the treatment you accord them will be the determining factor as to whether you go into 'everlasting life.'" (The Watchtower, August 1, 1981, p. 26)<br>  <br>  <br>  "And while now the witness yet includes the invitation to come to Jehovah's organization for salvation, the time no doubt will come when the message takes on a harder tone, like a 'great war cry.'" (The Watchtower, November 15, 1981, p. 21)---<br>  <br>  God's word, the Bible disagrees with these teachings of the watchtower.<br>  <br>  "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. <br>  He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son hath not life." (1 John 5:11-12)<br>  <br>  "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, <br>  but according to His mercy He saved us." (Titus 3:5)<br>  <br>  "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.' (Acts 16:31)<br>  <br>  "The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Romans 6:23)<br>  <br>  I don't know about you, but I am going to believe the Bible over the Watchtower.|`|AA10554783	no and who cares what they have to say , 1914!|`|f5IcUlXTaa	No,  they truly believe that unless you are a baptized member of the Jehovah's witnesses, you are counted as the walking dead.

He said if she was alive when armageddon got here she would be destroyed my Jehovah.  This was a pious old woman who went to church (Assembly of God) every week of her life.  Her husband was a minister.  She never swore, smoked, drank or did anything that she deemed sin her whole life.

ZmdIlkpQaa	Nobody knows.  They left to written record of their language.  It's pretty clear that they had language, and that it probably varied and evolved quickly as they spread out across Eurasia, but without written records, there's no way to determin what their language is.  It's not until much, much later that written language started to come up, and even then, we don't really know what the Egyptian or Summerian or Babylonian languages sounded like.  We have a fair amount of their writings, and we are able to divine much of the meanings behind the words, but not the way those words might have been pronounced.|`|88bDvyiwaa	jewish?|`|z7TvomOlaa	You know, that's just pathetic.

ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	I know someone who's married and she wears her ring on a chain because she'd have to take it off all the time anyways to wash her hands for surgical lab. When you have job where you have to continuously wash your hands (working in a hospital-type setting) it's just easier to wear it on a chain so you're still wearing it and not worry about losing it.<br>  <br>  I wear my grandparents' wedding rings on a chain because my grandpa's doesn't fit and I wanted my grandma's to be with it.... But if this is a ring specifically for your fiance then I don't think that's the problem. Unless it's really hot and her fingers have swelled or it's really cold and her fingers shrank enough that ring is lose and falling off. It happens to me a lot.|`|syIp6d2Naa	What kind of work does she do? If it's something where she is washing her hands often it makes more sense to wear it on a chain then. When she is at home is she doing things that should be done with out jewelry on. Like handling meat to cook, making patties for burgers, meatloaf, things with flour or breading.things like that I always take my rings off. Could it be she has either gained a couple pounds or lost a couple that's all it takes for a ring to no longer fit right. If it rally bothers you that much you need to sit down and talk about it. If your having communication problems now until it changes, I would not be walking down any ones aisle. You two need to be talking, about everything. If your different religions, what are you going to raise and kids to be?, are you going to have individual bank accounts or just a joint one. Who is going to actually pay the bills and write any checks?<br>  Are you both working, is one of you going to stay home after you start having children. Speaking of children how many and how soon do you want to start having them. Public school or private? Day care or family as a sitter? Holidays whose family are you going to share the holidays with. House work, who is going to do what around the house. Who is going to take car of the cars, the yard? The rule in ours since we both cook is who ever cooks don't wash dishes that meal. If the guys or gals at work what to stop and have a drink after work do you want that person to call and let you know so they won't worry when your not home at your regular time. Who's going to do the laundry? Who is going to pick out the colors and styles for you place. Pets? Dog or cat inside or out, (remember a dog can be no protection if he is outside and can't get in). There are tons of things to talk about and resolve before you marry, this is only a few things I could think of off the top of my head, there is  toms more too. If you go ahead and then find out you don't agree about anything you'll be divorced in no time. I wish you luck. <br>  See I think your already headed for trouble if you have not talked about the ring and it bothers you.|`|3XLnDyupaa	I'm sorry you had all these trolls answer you :/<br>  <br>  My dad does that because he works with food, and he doesn't want to lose it.<br>  Maybe it's a trend, Idk.|`|FGfaO2Ecaa	Well now I know people who are engaged that that dpn't even wear rings at all.

It's a very thoughtful very inexpensive gift. He loved it and said it was the best gift he had ever received. Good luck! I'm sure whatever you do he'll love it!|`|8oAlBL91aa	Yeah the slide show is a cool idea start from baby till now. Use all the best memories graduation, maybe first car, wedding, kids.

The people that voted for Obama because he was black are actually the racist ones. It is all about the issues in politics, color, sex, race, do not matter. Many whites voted for Obama way before the blacks started to vote for him, during the primaries. Why do we always have to put a face on the issue? Vote for who you think will do the best for the country and you will at least have the satisfaction of knowing in your heart you did what was best.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Because there are idiots out there who think that this election was a race issue.  I don't care if Obama was the whitest or blackest man on the planet, I didn't vote for him because he was the most liberal voting Senator in the Senate during his term and he had no leadership experience in anything he ever did in life.  Having someone so far out there to the left (or right for that matter) is not someone who can bring both parties together and unite this divided country.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	I WENT THROUGH THE SAME STUFF!<br>  <br>  I am a black conservative and I am treated very poorly in the black community because of my views.

t1uKdzmLaa	I guess people see volunteering as a means to make themselves feel better. I have nothing against volunteering (I do so myself) but I do not feel it is right to make others who don't volunteer feel bad just cause they don't. <br>  <br>  Volunteering is a good way to give back to the community but not the ONLY way to do so. People have to respect that you may prefer different means to give back to your community. Also, they have to be considerate of the fact that you may not have the time to do so due to life circumstances (hey, things do happen in our lives that need our immediate attention). <br>  <br>  People in upper/middle classes do not understand the life experiences of those in "lower" classes since they are living their lives with contentment. You may decide to volunteer later in life when you are able to - but people need to understand that not everyone has the time to volunteer for good reasons.
U8oR3VU6aa	Yes and no--I agree that it is like back in school. I choose not to be a part of it, I don't agree with it--but I refuse to be part because it is unfair.

AA11156135	The same reason the rich should be saved.<br>  <br>  There's the down-'n-outers and the up-'n-outers. Saving the 'wretched' is convenient, - so then we hopefully won't have to look at them on the street.<br>  <br>  Plus it's easier to save the bums, - they know they have issues.

Just because my parents kicked me out at 13, thereby taking away all of the advantages and coddling that most other young people get, doesn't mean i deserve to get treated any less humanely. And to answer something of utmost importance that's on a lot of people's minds-no, i don't LOOK homeless. I wear basketball shoes, jerseys, name brand jean shorts and most people think i'm a college student. I'm actually training to be a boxer. That's the only place that DIDN'T stereotype me.

73nTYgdraa	Keep denying it if you didn't do it. Demand proof. Threaten to sue them if you get suspended.<br>  <br>  Make sure you sue them if they really did something wrong against you, it might actually be a hate crime against you.<br>  <br>  But most important of all, talk with your parents and try talking with them about a possible lawsuit. Make your parents mention a lawsuit while discussing this with the teachers and headmasters. If there really is no evidence if you doing this, then they'll get scared and they will probably just accept an apology and then drop it, even if you didn't do it. Go along with it.|`|v1mbL56caa	Hold your head high. Don't hate them. Deny it strongly. Seek legal advice. Try not to let this make you a biter person.|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	Hard knocks man.  What you can learn from this is that a lot of situations in life turn out to be "my word against theirs".  So, do what you can to avoid pissing people off and be cool with people in general.

I was being an ash-hole.<br>  <br>  What can I do?<br>  Basically protect your reputation so you can win a "my word vs. theirs" battle if it comes down to it.

AA10451488	I'm so very sorry for you. Losing a parent is so hard. My mother died three months before my wedding, so I know how you are feeling.<br>  <br>  Do try your best to attend. Know that your family and friends will be there to help you through this difficult time. Remember, every funeral home/church has a private room where you can step away and grieve privately... not to mention a stock-pile of tissues. You can also arrive before the services for a private time to be with your Dad, even if you don't stay for the open service/burial. <br>  <br>  Funerals can take many forms. Why don't you speak with the minister/funeral director about making the service more of a "celebration of his life". Your family can share with the minister many happy stories and memories of your Dad - which he can relay in the services.|`|xnsU60hhaa	I am so sorry for your loss.

I think you should go to the funeral if you can as it will offer what Americans call 'closure'. It will be a time when you can support the other members of your family and be supported by them. It will also be a time when you can celebrate the life of your father and appreciate all that he meant to you and to others. I am a church organist and play at funerals very frequently. I realise how important a funeral is to the bereaved, so I would urge you to attend it if you can and to have some input. Choose music and words which your father would have liked. Take care!|`|JVFmBStiaa	Well what i would do is go to the Funeral and just do what you have to do best in life you have to go threw things that you dont in life but i would hated it to right now in my life all i have in my Father and if i lost my father i wouldn't know what to do with my life but you know what i would just remember the bests of times and the worst of times in you're life so remeber that bud and always face you're fears just do what you have tdo okie.|`|O5Z6M9Rlaa	Don't be afraid of losing all your good memories!

Losing a close loved one is really tough. You're grieving and it feels like you're never going to be happy again. But I agree with the others--go to the funeral. I know you don't want that as part of your memories, but you need that for closure. Plus, it will benefit your family to have your support. You'll end up regretting it if you don't go. When my best friend died in a farming accident, I couldn't face going to the funeral either. I wish I had, if only to be there for his family too. You should go.<br>  <br>  Besides, what better way to honor your father? Use the funeral, not to mourn your loss, but to celebrate the great life he had. <br>  <br>  That being said, you're not required to look at his body in the casket during the viewing. I refused to look at my grandmother when she died (we were REALLY close). I wanted memories of her alive instead of dead as well. And really, it's only the vessel, not the actual person in that casket. His spirit has moved on.|`|f8ewmXsXaa	I'm not going to tell you that you have to go because I have no right to do so. If you don't go you wont be able to go later and to me its also a sign of respect for that person. I haven't lost either of my parents thankfully, but I lost my Nan when I was 10 (I'm 19 now) and wasn't allowed to go to the funeral.

Those without sin may cast the first stone. Gay or not God wants good things for you, will talk to you/with you just as you are. After that things get kind of murky.<br>  <br>  Some will tell you that same sex love is sinful because the Bible says men aren't to lay with another man as they would with a woman. At the same time this isn't a quote attributed to Jesus (God made flesh). Also the bible tells us the apostle John (the disciple Jesus loved) would lay his head on Jesus' chest (breast). Now in saying John was the disciple Jesus loved I am not suggesting these two men were sexually intimate, but John certainly did snuggle up to Jesus and Jesus had no problem with it. Nowhere does Jesus' actions or words explicitly say anything against same-sex love.<br>  <br>  Sure it was Adam & Eve (and not Steve), but it wasn't Risto & Eve or Johny & Sarah either. But if God was so clearly against same sex love than how is it that tight-knit bond between David and Jonathan is noted as surpassing the love between a man and a woman. How is it that John was not disparaged from being so intimate with Jesus. How is it that MEN are called to be the "Bride of Christ" along side women or are we really to assume Jesus example of the 10 virgins means only sexually pure woman will go to heaven? <br>  <br>  So how about sex? Well I think there's a lot of sex out there that disappoints God. The actions of pedophiles and rapist being just a few examples. The Old Testament suggest it is wrong to have sex w/ a menstruating woman. We have aversion today to men having multiple wives. David, Solomon and others had multiple wives; what does God think? Can married people have sex anywhere, anytime for any reason? If your always looking for the pleasures of sex or trying to sexually please someone else when do you have time to be in relationship with God? What's so right about domineering your partner to submit to you sexual wants? See, I haven't even talked about gay sex and there's enough questions.<br>  <br>  I don't have all the answers but I do think people deserve better and more compassionate answers from church leaders and those that claim to speak the message of God.<br>  <br>  As far as I can tell all of us are loved. As far as I can tell it's a lot more about the rest of your heart that pleases God than if your gay or not.|`|Lb15XHvBaa	God loves everyone no matter what.

Some people make strong statement to show how much they don't hate, but deep down they really do. Listen to these coded messages.<br>  <br>  Love the sinner, hate the sin: That's just coded language for I still hate you. If you truly love the sinner, you will accept him/her regardless of that individual's characteristics or behavior.<br>  <br>  I hate sin: No, if you want someone to change you really hate the sinner.<br>  <br>  I disagree with their lifestyle: No, you really hate them and want them to conform to your world view.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is a sin: No it is not. Jesus never spoke to the concept of sexual orientation or homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Just because I don't agree with their sin, does not make me a hater: Yes, it does.

No special treatment for anyone. He expects the same of all of us. And... as such bi and gay people are no more or less sinful than anyone else on the planet.... WE all fall short and are in need of repentence in this life.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I think that is beyond our ken.<br>  <br>  Science is the process of observing the Universe in action, and then constructing theories that fit the data. As we get more data, we are able to construct better theories.  From that we learn how the universe works...(which is no small accomplishment) but nothing else.<br>  <br>  For example, lets say that hundreds of years after a nuclear war a small tribe of nomads finds a working lawn mower, complete with a can of gasoline and some oil, in the ruins of a house near Tucson. Now lets assume that one of the brightest members of the group has a broken leg, so he can't go hunting till it heals. He sits around camp all day tinkering with the lawn mower. He manages to find a CRAFTSMAN tool kit, and he manages to get it working. Being a bright chap he figures out how the pistons go up and down, that the oil is needed to lubricate the mechanism,  that the spark plug makes a spark that makes the gasoline burn, and how that pushes the pistons, etc. <br>  <br>  Even if he figures out the mower totally, he won't ever know what the letters JOHN DEERE stand for, or about the corporate headquarters in Moline Illinois, or the The John Deere Harvester Works in the Quad Cities.  None of that data is contained in the lawn mower. <br>  <br>  Similarly the data you seek is not contained within the structure of the Universe, and therefore we can not learn it from observing the Universe.|`|NELgv47Eaa	so thus they have no arbitery point..<br>  <br>  ohh tht doesnt mean that reality is changing :s. more the mathmatical proofs we have on things like this are rewitten regualrly as something new comes up and disproves the previous theory so a new one has to be made to accompidate for this new thing.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Look into String Theory...|`|LjsRfaskaa	The laws of physics are created by matter and energy.

I don't believe there is one true religion, or that there are any definitive answers out there.  I more or less think we have to come to our own answers, and that sacred texts are just like a sort of guide along that path.  They don't offer any real answers, but they do get us thinking about what those answers might be so we can find them for ourselves.<br>  <br>  So in my mind anyone who takes the texts themselves too seriously is missing the point.  It's not so much about what they say as literal truth, but more about interpretation.  They're just stories to spark our imaginations and get us thinking about the divine, and nothing more than that, IMO.<br>  <br>  So. I'm down for all different sorts of spirituality, as long as they can see it's just a system of belief, and not *the* system of belief.|`|4sVB0efkaa	Well I'm atheist, so as long as they dont enforce their religion on me, then I'm okay with it, but I prefer the non-religious .

I am against organised religion, especially Catholicism.  We have been together for nearly 4 years and although it is not perfect, what is in this life.  We are very respectful of each others views (most of the time) and although we do discuss it sometimes, it is just a small part of our life together that we don't share.

That allows the blacks who sold out and feel guilty from doing anything to help their brothers and sisters who have fallen victim to racism when they take a stand.<br>  <br>  2. That allows whites who claim that we're now all equal from "remembering" that racism didn't end with slavery, Jim Crow or lynching.  It is still ongoing as they reject us from top colleges letting only blacks who get affirmative action squeeze past (but that "priviledge" is also shared with white women, Asians, Hispanics, Indians, Native Americans, etc.), blacks are followed <br>  <br>  3. That lets them put out statistics that black men are going to jail the most or that rappers are society's greatest threat, while rock stars space out on drugs and white kids shoot up schools and there are no "statistics" used for those.<br>  <br>  4. That allows them to state that affirmative action should end because we're all equal.  Meanwhile guys like George Bush get into Yale with a "C-" average and McCain gets into military school after generally bumbling and joking through school when his father's friend pulled strings.  On the other side, no one talks about the black kids in high school that pull down averages of 95-98% with extracurricular activities and get rejected by these same schools.<br>  <br>  5. Black women and men can then "peacefully" marry into the white race and become a "melting pot" and example of "racial harmony."  Whites lynched blacks for looking at white women wrong, raped black women because they were property, bent Halle Berry over backwards and forcibly kissed her and escaped charges, violated Abner Louima with a stick, voted for McCain because Obama was black, sent hate mail to Obama because he was black, ignored cries of "Kill him," "Socialist," "Muslim" because Obama was black (Palin), refused to stop murders in Sudan, South Africa, poverty in Haiti, etc. but would invade Iraq and Afghanistan to get resources and back England as it holds Ireland captive...   And some of these same whites and their kids are alive today...how can racism be over? <br>  <br>  6. Whites can now call for "peace" now that "Dr. King's dream has been realized" and Obama is president.  Hear Dr. King's own words <br>  <br>  -"True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.”  <br>  <br>  -"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle. And so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom. A man can't ride you unless your back is bent." <br>  <br>  -"Discrimination is a hellhound that gnaws at N$groes in every waking moment of their lives to remind them that the lie of their inferiority is accepted as truth in the society dominating them." <br>  <br>  -"Everything that we see is a shadow cast by that which we do not see." <br>  <br>  -"Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."<br>  <br>  -"He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it."<br>  <br>  -"History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."<br>  <br>  -"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."<br>  <br>  -"Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal."<br>  <br>  -"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."<br>  <br>  -"The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict."<br>  <br>  -"A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus." <br>  <br>  -"A lie cannot live." <br>  <br>  -"A right delayed is a right denied." <br>   <br>  -"All progress is precarious, and the solution of one problem brings us face to face with another problem." <br>  <br>  "Almost always, the creative dedicated minority has made the world better." <br>  <br>  -"An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity." <br>  <br>  -"The means by which we live have outdistanced the ends for which we live.

h3VqVwbQaa	Just make it clear that you find him following you annoying and that you have told your parents and they said they will get the police involved if he continues. That should scare him off.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	I know someone who has had this problem for several years.  Are you sure that he follows you as he likes you or is the reason rather more worrying. It is awful as you lose any privacy, but it is more scary if you think that the person seems to want to take over your life and control you.  This is a sign of wanting power and possession  rather than it being a sign of affection or attraction. <br>  <br>  It is not easy to go to the police as there is no proof about what is happening.  If he is actually stalking you then it is because he has a psychological problem and that will not go away. If it makes no difference whether he is attractive or not, then it does sound more like stalking as you are not giving him any sign back that he could misinterpret. <br>  <br>   Perhaps you could get someone older, a parent or friend, to go with you a few times to see what happens.  <br>  <br>  As you have put your question in this section you could always explore the idea  of finding someone (responsible and respectable) who could bind him from coming near  you either by psychological or magical means;  they are not that far apart.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	#1 - I don't understand what "looks" have to do with this - yours or his. <br>  <br>  #2 - where is "everywhere you go" - is this in school, outside of school, both?  Is he approaching you regularly trying to be friendly?  And if so, what's he say?  I'm trying to figure out what it is that's annoying.  Is it just that this guy wants to be friends with you two and you don't want to be friends with him, or what?  (And if that's the case, then you both can simply tell him that you're not interested in a friendship and you would appreciate it if he would stay clear of you two.)<br>  <br>  #3 - There are laws against stalking, if this guy is really following you all around and creeping out you and your friend, speak to an authority figure (if at school, talk to the principal, if outside of school - report the activity to the police.)|`|xETCO0rUaa	Wrong catergory but i have lots of experiance with stalkers, when you live in a big city like i do it's pretty much a daily thing. <br>  <br>  Is it at school? If so just be really really really mean to him. Whisper behind his back, give him dirty looks when you catch him looking at you ect. <br>  <br>  If it's not at school and he just has your number just don't ever text or call him back. Or answer and tell him to f*** off, and leave you alone. <br>  <br>  But otherwise sometimes it's fun to mess with stalkers:):) then when he finds out you were just messing with him he'll leave you alone.|`|qRAwBtJ5aa	why you posted this in this catergory, i'l never know.<br>   when you think he is following you meet up with your other friend and a few male friends.<br>  approach the stalker and warn him and talk to him. keep your male friends in the background but not to close to be intimidating but close enough to aid you in case it got serious.<br>  <br>  would it be different if the stalker was cute?<br>  why the hell would that make a difference?<br>  if all fails then involve your family, the police etc.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	If the guy is an adult or can be regarded as dangerous you should involve your family with no delay.<br>  <br>  If he is in your age and just simply plain annoying - nobody to be afraid of with other words - I think the best way is to just simply let him know that two guys is a group and three is a crowd... With other words he should let you and your friend to be alone.|`|UF7G8Dolaa	his a stalking vampie, a wooden steak an a hammer will stop it! :)

A lot of serial killers are called "Vampires" because they are a certain type that tends to drink the blood of their victims, because a voice in their mind is telling them to. (Which would be schizophrenia.)<br>  <br>        They are not Dracula-esque Vamps, but just a person who feels as if they need to drink blood, which can be considered a certain type of Cannibalism. Some people do not have any mental issues but choose to live the life of a "Vampire" because they are fascinated by it or some other reason like that. Here is more information:|`|4cdwde4kaa	She probably had just a tinsy bit too much to drink lol <br>  <br>  But I long to believe in Vampires...As lame as it sounds, I want to visit Forks, Washington just too see if I could find anyone as incredible as Edward Cullen (Idk if you seen the movie/read Twilight, but it's amazing, and you should if you haven't :)). So yeah...I really hope they exist-In the Edward Cullen way. ALSO, if you like Vampire books (Fictional ones I mean, like stories) and manga, you should read Rosario+Vampire. It's an incredible series....Hahahah that was a little off-question. My bad. But yeah, back on subject, that chick just had a little too much to drink ;)
YXGdwwTJaa	You are lucky to see one.  I imagine they are still fairly common in some parts of the USA but not in Britain.  <br>  <br>  Unless some Native American will tell you their meaning, you will have to work it out yourself.  Have a look at the osprey or hold it in you rmind. What qualities does it suggest to you and can you transfer them to human terms?   <br>  <br>  This is a bird that flies but seeks its food in the water, yet soars up with the effortless grace and power of an eagle,  and can nest in trees or on telegraph poles.  It rears usually only one chick, unless lucky.  <br>  <br>  I think they are beautiful ruling the sky and sea without egotism, concentrating on living, on being.  <br>  <br>  What do you think and feel about them?

jx9YnFV8aa	Because I am neither North or South Korean, I would like to propose a hypothetical situation as a way to view the question of how each side feels toward the other. I think you have to first look at what tore the Korean peninsula apart. Communist China invaded Korea as Communist regimes will do as a means to spread its influence. Much like Eastern Europe during post WWII, Communism divided territory, tore families apart and walled itself off from the rest of the free world. It imprisoned its people and indoctrinated its children into believing in the state as the sole source of fulfillment in life.<br>  <br>    Imagine how people felt as their farms were taken away from them, their families decimated by military conscription and barbed wire fences designed to keep them enslaved by the government. Now, imagine North Korea today as the conflict looms in the distant past. The younger generations hence, persevering and surviving on political propaganda and rice from state owned agriculture. <br>    I would imagine there is some indifference, some hope of reunification and perhaps some disdain on both sides as one prospers as a free trading nation of the world and the other utilizing military might to gain political influence in an otherwise skeptical alliance of democracies.<br>    See these peoples as they are, human, fragile and perhaps more hopeful than ever since the war that tore them apart, that some day soon they will be a united Korea.|`|dnMzL5v5aa	If you happened to be walking down in the South Korean capitol wearing a north korean uniform or speaking in a north korean dialect. South koreans will be shocked, feel uneasy, report them, stare with devious eyes, wonder what's going on, they will be an alien.<br>  <br>  If a south korean were to be in north korea...may god save his/her soul.<br>  <br>  My grandmother is korean and I've been to korea a few times. They want to help the north, but its a fine line between helping and looking down on them even if they've been oppressed and starved.

Yu cud take french afterwards as well<br>  <br>  [:|`|c3CVY87caa	If you want to travel take french<br>  <br>  If you want to get a high degree like a phd then take latin<br>  <br>  If all of the above, take latin<br>  <br>  If none of the above, take spanish (you'll get alot of use out of it)|`|jfcrxSSBaa	It would depend on what you wanted to do in your future.  If you plan on getting into academics, science, the medical field, learning many languages, &c, I would recommend Latin, as it would certainly aid you.<br>  <br>  If it is just for a language to learn, I would suggest French.  It is much more applicable for the non-academic in our modern world.  It would open many doors as far as travel, such as Quebec, Canada, France, North Africa, Madagascar, and many other countries that use it as a first, or even second language.  It would be handy to have in, say, Europe, as many of the people there are polyglots, so if you didn't know their native language, you could use English or French.  I used this when I was stuck in Germany, talking with a Ukrainian woman.  She spoke no English.  So between Russian and German, we managed to have a nice conversation.|`|AA12283307	Well it depends if you plan on working in Canada-French<br>  if you are planning on learning many languages such as Spanish, Portuguese,etc.-Latin<br>  personally I would take french being that it is easier and it's what I learned throughout the rest of my grades and the chances are better of me living in a place that speaks French rather than Latin|`|5Ks1bEVXaa	im taking latin right now,<br>  its extremely hard for me,<br>  if you do take latin, be ready for ALOT of hard work and study time.<br>  im not even kidding,<br>  im in latin three right now, and its honestly torture.|`|ff545BLyaa	Latin because it is the origin of almost every romance language of which french is one so learning latin could also help you to later learn french and tons of other languages.|`|vpv8MWOXaa	Latin is helpful if you plan to be a science major, especially for biology and anatomy since all the vocabulary is Latin and Greek rooted. Both of my parents took Latin in high school. My dad found it helpful for medical school, but neither of them remember how to speak it (not that they'd have to). A friend of mine also took it in college because she was an archeology major, and found it helpful in that area. <br>  <br>  I've never taken Latin, but I took Spanish in middle school and French all four years of high school. Since they are both largely based in Latin, I found I still recognized many of the Latin roots within the words and remembered them when I took Biology, Anatomy, etc in college. Also, now I can actually use my French when I travel. Hopefully that helps you decide :o)|`|RaSxzGFraa	Absolutely French because is a language who a lot of people speak and  'cause in my opinion Latin is very boring even if is the ancestor of a lot of present languages.|`|t4EZLUCKaa	well, french is the more easy than latin, see for me is more easy to take french because is almost like the spanish and i can understand everything so if u can take u can learn french more easy the spanish|`|0BkeJfYYaa	french<br>  is wayyyyyyy easier than latin.<br>  <br>  i'm taking french now. and im actullay passing the class. the only bad thing my french teacher is soooo boring and he forgets things. -.-|`|vwxQDxGsaa	Latin, because many languages are based on it and it will help you learn other languages faster and easier.

I just don't agree that god exists or exists in any way we can comprehend.  There is no evidence for or against god.  you cannot prove or disprove gods existence.  <br>  <br>  This fits in with the argument that science seeks to disprove god.

Case in point- I have a friend who is a member of the Assembly of God church, and although I believe in a higher power (no matter what you call him/her), beyond that we part company. Anybody subscribing to that brand of religion would label me an "atheist"; yet by pure definition I am not. I just use the brain I was given.

Some religions, especially Judaism, consider being angry at God a religious response. In any event, in order to  have a genuine anger or hatred towards God, you first have to have a deep faith or belief in his existence before you would commit to exerting all that negative energy.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Ask yourself why it is only Christians that get attacked and not the other religions?!!!!<br>  <br>  Do you not recognise that Christians are provoking retaliation and repudiation for their terrible attitudes?!!<br>  <br>  Perhaps if Christians stopped their intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted postings things might change!! <br>  <br>  Perhaps if Christians stopped eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more things might change!! <br>  <br>  Perhaps if Christians stopped being the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more things might change!! <br>  <br>  Perhaps if Christians stopped demanding freedom of religion whilst they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them things might change!! !!!<br>  <br>  If Christians rediscovered the god of love and forgiveness and put aside all those terrible human emotions things would definitely change!!!!<br>  <br>  Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!! Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!<br>  <br>  As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it the problem will cease!!!!<br>  <br>  So please understand it is not about belief but about BAD conduct!!

I look at the sky, the hills, the birds, feel the wind, etc.  I try to connect with the reality of the physical world around me.

0rpN2419aa	This happened with mom, although we only live 3 plus miles away, there were times we were not availabe...camping or traveling, so we went to the post office and ansked if she could have the mail delivered near her back door, and they told us to put a mailbox up, and that they would deliver it.  She is on a rural route, and the highway is way too busy for to walk out to with her walker.  Having the mailbox close to the back door makes it easier for everyone.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I suspect that the U S Postal Service does not encourage the postal patron to request services for invalid patrons when it is not absolutely necessary. Therefore I would trust that our mail service will do the honorable thing and provide what ever service is required and is feasable.  My mail carrier is a person of class and is honorable.   I depend on his call to duty. The mail must go through. When it was possible he would drop off a dozen fresh eggs to the poor widow down the way if I sent them with him and my mother could give him a new shawl that she had knitted for the poor widow down the way. Those days are in the past for several reasons, but the desire to serve is a part of the mail carriers character. I salute them. They will answer the call to duty.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I would call the closest branch of the post office to find out that info.<br>  They would tell the person that you have to erect an outside mailbox<br>  alongside the road, where the delivery person can drive up and pull<br>  the lid down and put the mail inside, and that's all I know of the situation.

Here are some of the delivery services used to bring the mail to your home, be it a city apartment or a country farm.<br>  <br>  City Delivery may be established within the area to be served provided, among other criteria, the area has a population of at least 2,500 residents or 750 possible delivery points, and at least 50 percent of the building lots are improved with homes or businesses. <br>  <br>  Rural Delivery is established through the determination of local postal managers. A rural route should serve an average of at least one residential or business delivery per mile. In addition, roads should be public and must be well-maintained and passable year round. Extensions of rural delivery service should also serve at least one family for each additional mile of travel, including retrace. The requirements for road conditions are the same as those for establishment of the route.<br>  <br>  <br>  Curbside Delivery mail goes into customer boxes located at street edges. <br>  <br>  Central Point Delivery is for folks who share one delivery point for several addresses. If you live in a newly developed neighborhood you might have a convenient Neighborhood Delivery and Collection Box Unit with your own compartment to receive your mail.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Your box must be within one half mile of the next closest delivery to receive delivery.

They are required by law to serve the disabled so you can get your mail. You can't however just put a box up where ever you like. It has to be okey dokied by them exactly where it goes.

EoDeSDnmaa	To suggest that Jesus never existed is to definitely engage in selective skepticism. Most historians agree Jesus did indeed exist.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: He may have existed but nothing in the "gospels" is factual. The gospels were written decades later by people who were obviously not contemporaries of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Nothing outside of the bible is contemporary.  Josephus was a toddler, not a contemporary and the one supposed reference was a forgery.  Tacitus wasn't born yet.  Contemporary historians all seemed to ignore such astounding news of death, miracles and resurrection - i.e. didn't happen.|`|AA11297267	for monte:  that's an outright lie.  "Most" historians do NOT agree that an actual jesus existed.  "Most" historians state the fact that there is no enough evidence to say that he did or didn't -- it's only "most" christian religious historians that would agree with your statement.<br>  <br>  The fact is that there is not one objective, verifiable source that mentions jesus outside of the bible.  There are no contemporary non-biblical references of him, and the few non-contemporary references have either been proven to be frauds, are extremely questionable, or are simply repeating that there are christians that exist (long after jesus supposedly lived) who claim to follow a guy named jesus.  None of these is evidence that he existed.<br>  <br>  What "most" historians will tell you is that the most likely scenario is that the jesus in the bible is a composite of two or three radical jews that lived in Jerusalem during the Roman occupation, and taught various things.  None of them claimed to be a son of god, and none of them were resurrected.  Those multiple rebel characters (who rebelled against both Roman rule and orthodox judaism) were most likely the source of the jesus myth.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I'm agnostic on whether there was an actual  person the mythology was based on but I lean toward there may have been. There is no really good evidence for their existence. Outside the Bible there are no historical sources from within the time period they would have lived. So at best there are only a handful of accounts outside the Bible from after they died saying what followers reported to them. This is hearsay. After this problem comes the fact that of these few accounts there are issues of forgery, later church interpolations, and some just being recapitulations of another source. There are many historical hypotheses on this. There are some who believe the Jesus character was a composite of more then one itinerant style preacher of the time period as well. To claim that there is more historical evidence for an actual Jesus as a person then any other person in history seems to me to be either indicative of intellectual feeble mindedness or intellectual dishonesty.|`|4sUek7ugaa	No, there's no proof, just some mentions of the movement from decades later, but some of us think that the movement must have coalesced around an actual charismatic individual.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Guys, there is not one shred of evidence for a resurrection.  All we have is some stories told by those who believed it.  There is as much evidence for the resurrection of Jesus as there is for the ascension of Julius Caesar to heaven.  Several people claim to have witnessed that, too.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!<br>  <br>  He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?<br>  <br>  Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!<br>   <br>  Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!<br>  <br>  At best he was an amalgam of those others!!|`|WcxrnINvaa	no direct evidence|`|5eSJpYbMaa	I didn't research enough about the issue to say for certain but I am leaning towards no. Some of the secular historical accounts about his life (such as the one Josephus "wrote") were proved to be doctored and others are misinterpreted and refer to different characters of history entirely. <br>  <br>  The "ancient artifacts" that keep "mysteriously" popping up in the area where the ancient town of Nazareth was supposedly located seem suspicious as well. 100 years archaeologists were digging over there and found nothing. Yet after they left all these artifacts just appeared "out of nowhere."|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	There are but a handful of passing and historical references.  the most significant one, i.e. the only one from near to the actual time, was from Josephus Flavius, the noted Roman Historian.  However, that short paragraph is widely criticized for being very out of place with the surrounding text and very likely added at a later date.  Even then, it is only a reference of something that he heard about, not witnessed. And, at this time, some of the gospels were already being written.  So, it's here-say.<br>  <br>  Here's where I stand.  Such a man (not deity) may have existed.  But what we can be certain of was that he was not a significant religious or political figure in his day.  While much documentation of the politics and history of the time remains, Jesus is not a player in any of it.  So, what we do know is that if he were a god, he wasn't a very influential one during his life.<br>  <br>  His fame and following came generations, nay, hundreds of years later.  Strange for a deity, don't you think?|`|ATsdSM7saa	Outside of the gospels, which are horribly inaccurate and contradictory, there is no contemporary mention of this person.<br>  <br>  The next mention is by Flavius Josephus quite a few decades later, which proves nothing other than he heard the story.|`|rWP4suXuaa	They have know eyes to see or ears to hear..without faith there is nothing to reveal...to them there is know Jesus.

Many find this odd, since the Romans were known to keep extremely detailed records of everything, down to laundry lists.<br>  <br>  The earliest documents (this includes the books of NT) that mention Jesus are 4 decades after his alleged existence, which coincides with a few generations' passing.|`|yu53u5TFaa	To suggest that Jesus existed is to definitely engage in selective skepticism. It's so easy for someone to be skeptical about the existence of Buddha or Mohammad because we were not raised to believe in those people.<br>  <br>  The only shred of evidence we have for Jesus' existence is the Bible, and to use that as proof that he was a real guy is like using Greek mythology as the basis of a belief that Hercules existed.|`|UR4mWefGaa	It is kind of funny. historically, apollonius of tyana, and horus have the same attributes of jesus. There is not much historic evidence that jesus ever existed. This is a fact. if you have faith not based on fact, you are ok. Your faith is on it's own. You just cannot use history  or science to justify your faith. .|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	No real proof Jesus exist, no history mention him until decades after he suppose live, some mentions are forgeries, Christians add 121 word passage in Josephus' "Antiquities..." 200 years after Josephus die, Origen, other Christian writers not see this passage, it out of context, favor Christians but Josephus is Pharisaic Jew, he say more of other Messiahs, all this prove passage of Jesus in Josephus is later forgery.

There are around 24,000 copies of the NT and also over 86,000 letters between the early churches which refer to every passage in the NT except for 11. Any real historian is embarrassed by the sheer volume of copies of the NT versus any other ancient writings. The next closest is Homer's Iliad with around 900. Just because there is not a wealth of extra-biblical sources does not suggest anything...they may not have survived antiquity....the question is ...do the Biblical accounts agree, are they accurate examples of eye-witness testimony and are they close enough to the originals to preclude any corruption...the answer is a definite yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Josh McDowell's "New Evidence that Demands a Verdict" six part series on Youtube....<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SekR-QHCXVU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SekR-QHCX...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Case/case1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-islam.org/Case/case...</a>|`|urQQ6kbcaa	Only the bible & that's laughable|`|cdFqekzZaa	Some may be correct.

He is pretty good to talking to people in their dreams!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he “wouldn't SIN against God"! God himself NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF was present in this King’s Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that King Abimelech might have enjoyed with Sarah! BTW, Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” --not related to any Bible God. But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much go to be tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap that some Christians are willing to kill to defend! It takes years of Christian schooling to keep Christianity still marketable today! The top Clergy is fully aware of all the Holy Crap that they peddle!<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only God knows how many nights he was already watching him perform in his royal bedroom!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband. God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man at all! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers all along! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he watched him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the Time God in the person of the Holy Ghost visit the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he KNEW A LOT about how to please mortal women!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he was aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN or even FOX NEWS for that matter was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife'hooker Sarah without any objections for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it!) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is just like in the case of EVE, but in this case Sarah is a “sinful” sexy woman not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit a sexual “sin” against this Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? Christians tell you that this God is very apologetic preventing Sarah from enjoying having sex with King Abimelech because she was going to be one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors are loaded of sexual escapades! It is all in the Bible scrip!)|`|JQLpNJzuaa	The spiritual meaning is:<br>  <br>  "Perhaps you are going insane!"<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	Falling asleep? Dreaming?

cR8UZdi1aa	My advice would be to not believe everything you hear. Especially here. So many people who are NOT JW's & know nothing about JW's are answering for JW's. That doesn't even make sense. You have already gotten a lot of informative answers from real JW's who explained that we as JW's do not stop associating with someone if they are not JW's themselves. That's an obvious fact.<br>  <br>  Psalms 83:18 is just one of many scriptures that states God's name, here is the KJV of this scripture: "That [men] may know that thou, whose name alone [is] JEHOVAH, [art] the most high over all the earth." JW's ARE Christian, we believe & follow Jesus Christ, but not all professed "Christians" believe in Jehovah God, which shows that they have not really read this scripture or the Bible. Some are sincere & just need to do some research, others like the imbeciles here who have answered viciously about JW's know that the Bible clearly states that God's name is Jehovah, & that JW's ARE Christian. It's really not as complicated as others make it out to be. It's simple really.|`|eRg04AoEaa	I like the answers that said that it is not a personal thing against you, no 1 is calling you "bad association". No one here knows who you are or what kind of person you are so we can't say what type of association you are. I also liked how the 1 answer above mentions that it is ALWAYS easier to associate & become close friends with those who share the same beliefs & desires & goals, etc. That goes for everyone, not just JW's. & 1 other thing I agree with is that you need to ask these specific people, because as a JW we do not snub or shun people who do not share the same beliefs, we have friends & associates outside of our religion. <br>  <br>  However, we do try & stay away from people who are harmful in their speech, make false accusations & try to persuade people to thinking the worst of JW's, such as Curious Jeorge who by his past answers shows he absolutely HATES JW's. We are not a cult either. & of course we ARE Christians! Just because others have told you we are not, doesn't mean they're right. They are very wrong & ignorant to make such claims too!<br>  <br>  So, nothing is meant as a personal offense against you, please ask these people you're referring too, about this. & ignore the obvious ranters & liars who do not know ANYTHING about JW's. I hate it when others who are NOT JW's answer for JW's, they don't know the answer & they don't care about how absurd their ridiculous answers are & how misleading they can be. They are even hurtful, so do not take what they have said as truth, it is absolutely NOT true.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Perhaps you can learn something from the Scriptures Quoted below.<br>   Do any apply to you since there is so Much insincerity in these forum?<br>   Proverbs 6:16-19) There are six things that Jehovah does hate; yes, seven are things detestable to his soul: 17?lofty eyes, a false tongue, and hands that are shedding innocent blood, 18?a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness, 19?a false witness that launches forth lies, and anyone sending forth contentions among brothers.<br>    Just asking.|`|AA11025703	Well if you studied with Witnesses then you should realize that we Are Christians.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  It isn't true that "Jehovah's Witnesses are only friends with their own kind and no one else".  I have friends that aren't Witnesses.  Honestly one my relatives that I'm closest to is not a Witness.<br>  <br>  I have an Aunt who's started studying.

He used to attend the meetings.  I don't get to talk with him much, but I think largely this is because of our lives taking such different paths.  Would I be happy if he started studying again??

Since you stopped studying with them. They now consider you as part of Satan's world and not worthy of their attention. It is a messed up religion. It is all about them.

So no, christians are giving worship to satan and JW's worship God, in their eyes. Be happy that you did not get baptized, life would have been a lot harder for you. I would recommend that you find a good church that you feel at ease at. That teaches from the bible and not Watchtower publications.

Maybe they think you want space since you stopped your study. JW are very open and friendly people why don't you ask them. Tell them that you feel like they are being stand offish and you don't want to lose their friendship. Tell them that you stopping studying was for  your personal reasons and it had nothing to do with them. I don't know how long you were studying for but JW consider themselves Christians as we believe in Jesus. As far as believing in the same God. We feel we worship the true God, Jehovah like he asks us to in the bible. I have plenty of friends that are not JW but it's hard to do lots of stuff together since we usually don't think of entertainment in the same way.

I appreciate you giving us a change to defend ourselves instead of making assumptions like so many people do.<br>  <br>  We do believe and try to follow 1Cor 15:33 Bad associations spoil useful habits<br>  <br>  I have friends that are not of my faith. My boss's wife and a friend of mine from high school. My little brother plays with the kids in his neighborhood on occasion. However, they respect our faith and don't pressure us into anything we don't wanna do. <br>  <br>  Christians believe that Jesus is God usually in a trinity.  This is what we believe. <br>  <br>  The Bible says at John 14:28 Jesus announces that the Father is greater than I am. So Jesus and God are NOT one.<br>  Also Colossians 1:15 says that Jesus is the firstborn of all creation. How can God create himself? Jesus is also called God's only begotten son John 3:16. In a family, are the father and son one person? No they are different people and the father is the head of the house. The same is in heaven. God created the family unit. God is the father and head over Jesus. 1 Cor. 11:3. How can God be head over the Christ if they are one person?<br>  John 1:1 which reads: "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God." This is often presented from the Gospel of John to prove that Jesus was God. There are however several problems with this claim:<br>  <br>  There is also another reason, considering the Greek of the above verse which disproves the assertion that Jesus is referred to as God in the verse. In the verse above, the first time the word God is used, the Greek is HOTHEOS, which means The God. The second time the word God is used,"....and the word was God," the word for God is TONTHEOS, which means A God. Europeans have evolved a system of capital and small letters non-existent in Greek. The God, HOTHEOS is translated as God with a capital G, whereas Tontheos, which means A or ANY God is translated with a small g, god. In this case however, we see the unlawful translators trying to prove Jesus being God by putting capital G for both whereas it doesn't belong in the case of<br>  the "word".<br>  <br>  Also John 5:30 Jesus said I'm here to do the will of the one whom sent me. How can Jesus be sent forth if he and God are one person?<br>  <br>  .(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.<br>  <br>  (Philippians 2:5-6) Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God<br>  (John 12:49) I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak<br>  <br>  (John 14:28) I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am<br>  <br>  (John 20:17) (Jesus speaking) I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.<br>  On the night of his arrest our Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. He prayed vehemently for the well being of his Apostles. He asks God that "they all may be ONE, as you Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be ONE in us, that the world may believe that you sent me. And the glory which you gave me I have given them, and that they may be ONE just as we are ONE." (John 17:21-22)<br>  <br>  Clearly Jesus was not asking his Father to make his apostles one in the same person. He was requesting that they be one in thought, purpose, and deed. Jesus Christ and Jehovah, his God and our God, are indeed one, but it is a oneness in their mission. This oneness of purpose can be compared to having a President and a Vice President. They are not the same literal persons, but they are one in representing the office of the presidency.<br>  John 14:26 Jesus says that his Father will send a helper the holy spirit. How can a helper be sent forth if they were one?<br>  <br>  John 5:43 Jesus said he came in his Father's name.<br>  <br>  So as one can see Jesus even said he is not equal to God and that his FATHER had sent him (in human form). Jesus is very important to us and he is one of the foundations of our teachings but as you can see even from your own Bible they are not equal.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word for God's name is YHWH or commonly translated into Iehovah in Latin and Jehovah in english. Jesus is God's (Jehovah's) son not God himself. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|AA10024451	(1) Jehovah's Witnesses ARE Christians. If you have studied with them, then you should know that.<br>  <br>  (2) The Bible counsels Christians to "do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers" and also "bad associations spoil useful habits". So keeping those principles in mind Jehovah's Witnesses would naturally associate primarily with those who share the same love and value of Bible morality and standards. We also would associate mainly with those who have the same love for Jehovah that we have, and so we can have an interchange of encouragement and support with them to continue on serving Jehovah despite the problems we all face in the world today. So, in other words, it would not be the wise course for us to develop close friendships or ties to individuals who do not share the same love for Bible principles that we have.......people who may use profanity or bad language.......people who may engage in celebrating false religious holidays......people who may believe there's nothing wrong with sex outside or marriage, and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  (3) Think of it this way. If you were a parent and wanted to raise your child to respect other people and their property and to be polite, and you found that your child was associating with other children who were rude to their parents and teachers, they regularly were in trouble for vandalism, and so forth........would you want your child to continue to associate with that one? No, you would wisely restrict or outright ban them from their friendship. So why is it unreasonable for Jehovah's Witnesses to choose as friends people who share their same values (based on the Bible)? It's not.<br>  ____________________________________<br>  <br>  Cam is spot-on correct in her statements, and there is certainly no reason to be embarrassed at all (unlike CJ who is clearly flustered and flailing about in his embarrassment). What could possibly be a good reason to associate with people who find nothing wrong with swearing, smoking, overdrinking, believe sexual immorality is OK, and so forth? All of those things violate Bible principles. I defy people like CJ and SS to come up with a single decent answer to that question.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, nothing that CJ states in any of his comments (where Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned) are to be taken as accurate, reliable, or truthful. His agenda, just like that of his Anti-JW cult friends, is to spread all sorts of lying slander and propaganda against Jehovah's Witnesses that they can. To listen to anything he has to say would be like going back to 1940's Germany and taking the Nazis' word on the "truth" about Jews. - His comments always reveal a deep-seated self-loathing and personal insecurity manifested in deflecting those onto other people. It's almost comical at times as he flails about.<br>  <br>  I&I also offered up nothing but lies in her comment as well. Despite her ignorance, Jehovah's Witnesses ARE Christians.....otherwise, why would we be preaching about Jesus Christ and why would he be at the very core of our beliefs?<br>   ________________________________________...<br>  <br>  Besides the fact that po' little CJ had to go back and make his edits in order to include the "answer" the claimed to give (which he didn't do).....take notice of a few things he did or didn't do: <br>  <br>  (1) He knows he can't dispute what the Bible very clearly says. I even quoted the direct scripture that is not one that is open to interpretation or ambiguous by any means and what does he do? Instead he aims his cultish claws at Jehovah's Witnesses themselves, in his typical childish "I really have no response, so I'll just make a clumsy attack on the JWs" fashion. Why make it about the Watchtower as opposed to the Bible itself? The Watchtower Society didn't write the Bible.....in fact the verse mentioned is in ANY and every translation. But no......because CJ is an apostate cult member, he has to be about attacking Jehovah's Witnesses. <br>  <br>  Very clumsy and inept of you, CJ......tsk, tsk. <br>  <br>  (2) I suppose we all knew this was coming. CJ just blatantly ignores the question posed to him in order to spew more of his illogical and nonsensical double-talk........which, to his detriment continues to prove me correct and him wrong. Let's ask it again: when you talk about one who is "moral and law-abiding".......whose morality are you talking about, and whose laws are you referring to? If it's a person who abides by Jehovah's laws and standards of morality, certainly they're not "bad association". If they abide by anyone else's, they would be. That's just common sense whether one is a Jehovah's Witness or not. <br>  <br>  It's funny to watch CJ try and justify his hatred, bigotry, and prejudice and act as if he even knows what he's talking about. Just watching him squirm as his ridiculous tactics are called out, which appears to be embarrassing him greatly......it's very satisfying.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  If anything's telling, it's the extremely weak effort CJ is putting into defending himself. For him to think anyone believes that he didn't edit his comment or that he has any kind of credibility........it shows that he's clearly losing it. He's already long since lost this argument, and the fact that he won't just admit to it is just another testament to his childishness. <br>  <br>  Second, I do admit to editing my answer. Why? In order to have the space needed to respond to his idiotic and asinine comments. Simple as that. Can't respond if there's no room to give the response. Clearly CJ is incredibly embarrassed by his own complete inability to win any arguments with me, try try try as he may. If I were him, I'd be embarrassed too. But when you have ZERO credibility like he does (not that he's even had any to begin with)......he responds by grasping at whatever pathetic straw he can find. <br>  <br>  One can't help but ROFL at him as he, yet for a third time now, ignores the question that's been posed to him  and he thinks by deflecting and going off on some non-point of discussion that it gets him out of needing to give an answer. THAT is a sure, tell-tale sign of an individual who is becoming very unhinged and unraveled. I guess with each argument he continues to lose to me, it takes more of the wind out of his sails. Let's see him do another dance around the question that's been asked 3 times now, and see if he's even remotely capable of answering a simple question. When you talk about someone who is "moral and law-abiding" ...... whose morality and whose laws are you referring to? We all know the obvious answer.......why won't you just state it? Because for you to state it, you'd simply admit what everyone already knows: you're wrong and you're completely full of crap. <br>  <br>  I give straight answers, while demented, delusional little CJ dances around them, deflects his many faults onto me, and then outrightly ignores the question because he can't answer it. If that's not like talking to a politician, I don't know what is. <br>  <br>  So again.......according to Jehovah God, through his Word the Bible, an "unbeliever" is someone his true worshipers are not to associate closely with. Those qualifying as "unbelievers" would be anyone who does not share the same value and adherence to God's laws and his standard of morality as set forth in the Bible. Plain and simple. <br>  <br>  CJ has always been proven to be wrong.......but like a sadist, he just keeps coming back for more. Sick.<br>  ____________________________________<br>  <br>  Oh there's po' old CJ....the masochist.....coming back for more, just like I said. It almost goes to show the depth of the neurosis he's suffering from. <br>  <br>  Interesting that his own comment can just be picked up, turned on its ear, and tossed back at him: For some reason he feels that lying about his edits can do anything for him in his losing argument. It's as if all the treaties have been signed closing out a war, and all of a sudden he comes out of left field, a lonely, single, delusional person with a BB gun trying to start things again. Very futile.....and very sad. <br>  <br>  For the fourth time now, yes 1 - 2 - 3 - 4, the little fella ignores my question and deflects yet again.....which goes on to further prove my point (thank you again) that he CANNOT answer it, certainly not without readily admitting his being wrong (which by now to all of us is just a foregone conclusion anyway). <br>  <br>  You can add a "yes or no" to your question all you like. I've already answered it numerous times throughout all of this. It's not a simple "yes or no" question. If your reading comprehension is so poor that you simply cannot understand, or if you're too lazy (stupid perhaps?) to figure out how to scroll up and read.......I'm afraid that's not my problem. A person can only point to the sky and tell you it's blue so many times.....but if you're unwilling to look up and admit it, what's the point?|`|865bVfl3aa	I am a Witness and I have a few friends who are not. The Bible makes clear that bad associations spoil useful habits. In the opinion of most Witnesses anyone who doesn't encourage you to want to do more in the service of Jehovah is bad association. While limited association with non-witnesses is definitely not wrong, there really is no good reason to spend a lot of time with them. Because you quit studying you made clear that you do not want to serve Jehovah and have no plans to teach your children to serve Jehovah. We love Jehovah. If people do not love Jehovah why would we want to spend much time with them? For a comparison, if someone made it clear that they didn't care for your parents, spouse, or children, would you want to be close to them? <br>  The other issue here is that we as Witnesses are very busy. In addition to the daily activities that all people must face we have Bible study, meetings, prayer, and service to fill our time. If someone is not interested in those things it is unlikely that they have very much in common with you.<br>  I'm sure that you are a very nice person, but they are just trying to obey the direction that we have been given in the Bible.|`|iTJWopCRaa	Ok, simply, if they judge others then they are not doing things according to the Bible.

It was only “after the Christian Church had come into alliance with the political establishment,” they add, that the church began to favor “an acceptance of the necessity of war.” The result? Christendom’s support of wars throughout the ages has become so flagrant that after the second world war, the United Church of Christ in Japan even felt the need to issue an official “Confession of Responsibility for World War?II.”<br>  <br>  Today, some 50 years after the war, Christendom’s belligerent reputation has changed little. “If we ask whether we as Christians have indeed said a firm and convincing No to the logic of war and Yes to the love of Christ,” admits Dr.?Roger Williamson, who works for the Church of England, “it is clear that we .?.?. still have much to confess.” Although the WCC declared in 1948 that “war as a method of settling disputes is incompatible with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ,” Christendom’s churches, Williamson notes, have often contributed to “bigotry, intolerance, restriction of human liberty and hardening of conflicts.” No wonder he concludes that “religion .?.?. often serves to exacerbate rather than end conflict.”<br>  <br>  The war that ripped apart the former Yugoslavia is a case in point. Despite the injustices and cruelties that have been taking place for years, the churches have found it very difficult to take a united stand on the conflict in that country. Why? Dr.?Williamson notes that despite their supposed Christian bond, Serbian and Croatian clergy are just as divided as their countries’ politicians. There and elsewhere Christendom’s clergy, whether Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant, act not as peacemakers but as “chaplains to their own side.” Though more than 300 churches now belong to the WCC, Dr.?Williamson admits that it is “surprisingly hard to find examples of churches actually making .?.?. peace.”<br>  <br>  Hard, yes. But unlike the WCC’s member churches, which are merely talking about reconciliation, there exists one religion that has already succeeded in reconciling former members of different religions and helping them become true Christians. Today, moved by their love for God and their desire to “pursue peace with all people,” in 235 lands the more than 7?million Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse to share in the wars of the nations—whether fought in such places as Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, or the former Yugoslavia. (Hebrews 12:14; Matthew 22:36-38) Instead, they are fulfilling Bible prophecy by ‘beating their swords into plowshares’ and ‘learning war no more.’—Micah 4:3.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Africa have been severely beaten because of their neutrality or have become refugees because of their refusal to go to war.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How to Identify the True Religion<br>  <br>    1. The true religion worships the only true God, Jehovah.—Deuteronomy 6:4,?5; Psalm 146:5-10; Matthew 22:37,?38.<br>  <br>    2. The true religion offers access to God by means of Christ Jesus.—John 17:3, 6-8; 1?Timothy 2:5,?6; 1?John 4:15.<br>  <br>    3. The true religion teaches and practices unselfish love.—John 13:34,?35; 1?Corinthians 13:1-8; 1?John 3:10-12.<br>  <br>    4. The true religion remains untainted by worldly politics and conflicts. It is neutral in time of war.—John 18:36; James 1:27.<br>  <br>    5. The true religion lets God be true by accepting the Bible as God’s Word.—Romans 3:3,?4; 2?Timothy 3:16,?17; 1?Thessalonians 2:13.<br>  <br>    6. The true religion does not condone war or personal violence.—Micah 4:2-4; Romans 12:17-21; Colossians 3:12-14.<br>  <br>    7. The true religion successfully unites people of every race, language, and tribe. It does not preach nationalism or hatred, but love.—Isaiah 2:2-4; Colossians 3:10,?11; Revelation 7:9,?10.<br>  <br>    8. The true religion advocates serving God, not for selfish gain or a salary, but out of love. It does not glorify men. It?glorifies God.—1?Peter 5:1-4; 1?Corinthians 9:18; Matthew 23:5-12.<br>  <br>    9. The true religion proclaims the Kingdom of God as man’s sure hope, not some political or social philosophy.—Mark 13:10; Acts 8:12; 28:23, 30,?31.<br>  <br>    10. The true religion teaches the truth regarding God’s purpose for man and the earth. It does not teach the religious lies of immortal soul and eternal torment in hell. It teaches that God is love.—Judges 16:30; Isaiah 45:12,?18; Matthew 5:5; 1?John 4:7-11; Revelation 20:13,?14.Jer.7:31<br>  <a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a> Down load free What does the Bible really teach.|`|AA11992885	false, each religion does NOT claim the truth in their doctrine<br>  <br>  try Buddhism, which puts forth that there is no ultimate truth, that everyone must find what suits him or her<br>  <br>  the Torah puts forth that every religion was created by God|`|g4AAZRuxaa	The true religion is Jesus is the Way the truth and the life.|`|f5IcUlXTaa	Get on your knees and ask Jesus into your heart.

The four Imaams  unanimously agreed that this is prohibited. In fact, there is no difference between this temporary marriage and a person who commits Zina (adultery or fornication) with a woman with a fixed fee. <br>  <br>  There are authentic narrations about the prohibition of this marriage. <br>  <br>  For instance, Ali  said to Ibn 'Abbas : ''The Prophet  forbade the temporary marriage and the meat of donkeys during the battle of Khaybar.'' <br>  <br>  Imaam Al-Maaziri  said: ''The temporary marriage was lawful at the early period of Islam, and then it was abrogated with authentic narrations. Moreover, the scholars  agreed in a consensus that it is forbidden. <br>  <br>  It is only a group of innovators who disagreed with this as they relied on abrogated narrations upon which they have no evidence. They supported their viewpoint with the recitation of Ibn Mas'ood  "So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them to a fixed time', and this recitation is weak and cannot be taken as evidence to be acted upon, since the authentic recitation does not state [to a fixed time." <br>  <br>  Qadhi Eyadh  said: "The scholars  unanimously agreed that this Mut’ah was a marriage for a fixed period without resulting in the right of inheritance; the two spouses separate without divorce after the fixed period ends. Afterward the entire Muslim nation unanimously agreed that this temporary marriage is forbidden with the exception of Al-Raafidhah. <br>  <br>  Ibn 'Abbas  considered it to be legal at the beginning but soon afterwards he withdrew his ruling. <br>  <br>  Moreover, the scholars  unanimously agreed that if this kind of <br>  <br>  It is also not correct to say that 'Umar  did not invalidate it.

People don't enjoy talking about sex because sex isn't really anyone's concern except for the ones engaging in the sex. <br>  <br>  That, among other things, such as jealousy, moral or religious beliefs, embarrassment, and so on. It's probably better to not ask questions where people would be required to expose their sex lives on the web, but at the same time, people should be a lot more polite when dealing with those kinds of questions. We may be on the Internet, but it is still people we are dealing with, and people have feelings. =3|`|1hPJs8kzaa	I agree. I hate when people give rude and offensive comments. Get over the hate.

ryorzCXFaa	Ok the girls you date are most likely very young amd yes when most of us are young "looks" matter  most men are this way even when they grow up.I don't know how old you are but as we all get older we realize that it doesn't matter to us so much people tell me I am pretty but what I care about is who I am and how I treat other people.My husband is not really attractive but that didn't matter to me I wanted someone who cared who I was inside not my outward looks.But unfortunately what I got was a man who only married for my looks so it works both ways and we can all be fooled take your time there are people out there like me who don't care about looks|`|lEmKvS50aa	You should care about looks.  You don't have to be vain however, when people see you they don't see your personality.  They see your outward appearance.  You have to get to know someone or know something about them in order to know their personality.  If you look like a slob it gives the impression you don't care about yourself or anything else for that matter.  People may never get to know the real you if you look a mess.  So the lesson today kids is, DON'T LOOK A MESS.|`|gwsypJc4aa	With the majority of girls, they exert a primal urge to be with the strong musclebound males, as in pre-civilization ( you know, caveman times ) where the smart were shunned and only the strong idiots were useful. but nowdays smart guys are to rule this world, and girls still hold on to that subconscious urge. keep on going dude, you'll find the one eventually. the mind of a 14 year old guy, makes sense of many things.|`|OvuMI50Maa	attraction matters i wont lie, (it has to do ur body chemicals, that u notice SOMETHING about the person physically) but the idea about personality becomes more and more real, as u get older. personality does matter, its what will make the relationship last. believe me. ur ex was prob just a loser, sry, if i offended u.|`|s25KpIsDaa	not all girls are the same some girls is the looks some girls are the personality and some of them are both like me|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	yeah some guys get ugly when they open their mouths and some ugly guys get better looking.

(though he is taller than me)  i think tis' more about personal taste.  someone for everyone type of thing :)  style also helps.  even if someone isn't that hot, but they are wearing really stylish clothes and cool shoes and maybe some square glasses, i'll be more likely to take a second look.  i dont' think it's shallow, no one is obligated to be with someone they dont' find attractive.  i think that as long as you take care of yourself, basic hygiene, dont' wear filthy jogging pants or ugly ill fitting clothes, keep your hair tidy, watch your weight and eat healthy, then someone will be interested in you.   it's only human nature to want to be with someone that you like that way they look :)|`|VsamHLPOaa	I would say girls are less shallow when it comes to who they will date. For instance in Mexico there is a guy who weighs 500+ lbs and has gotten married. Do you believe that if the tables were turned and there was a 500+lb woman that she would be getting married. Okay just wanted to state that but for me I would not say that I prefer personality OVER looks although personality plays a huge part in if I like a guy. There has to be some sort of physical attraction to make a relationship work and although it plays a major role it doesn't make it the most important.<br>  <br>  To sum it up, looks count but that can only get you so far. Personality is key to continuing a relationship or at least for me.|`|da4zS4AOaa	I honestly like both. Looks matter as well. I'm a classy nice girl. 18 year old still virgin. I've been approached by guys some were cute but their personality was a turn off. I was approached by another guy like 2 weeks ago, he has a nice personality and stuff but his looks turned me off, it's not my type. He's a big boy and I like slender man. Afterwards I found him boring. <br>  <br>  Oh well I'm very picky when it comes to guys. I haven't been in a relationship because I'm too picky. But I'll tell you this....If a really hot guy approached me I wouldn't mind smooching (this is only cause I haven't done it in a while) but I wouldn't want him as a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  It's funny. The hot guys most of them have bad personalities or just pure jerks, womanizers, sex is their best interest. And the not so hot have good personality. The okay looking with good personality are already taken.<br>  <br>  When will I get a good looking guy with good personality.

But yes on the majority white men are more of pedophile than any other race.  That's because the whites have very little morals.  When it comes to sexual inerts.

I dont think trillions of stars and planets could be created in a single day. dust, gases and other particles settling down in large rocks called planets is more realistic. everything with a mass has a gravity, so the more dust and particles combines, the more gravity comes and after some time (few thousand or million years) you'll get planets spinning around stars. and bible cant even give us any description of how things were created. it only tells who did, not how. science will talk about lightnings creating amino acids, or the moon being a massive asteroid crashing into earth. all what bible or any other book says is "god did it".<br>  <br>  btw the prophecies are a lucky guess. why wouldnt ethiopian jews return to israel? anyone can see people, their struggle and think about what might happen in the future.|`|AA10344836	Yes , God is real.

At this point, the abortion was morally required -- the infant was condemned no matter what, and the mother's life was able to be saved.<br>  <br>  However, modern medicine does provide options other than abortion that can save both in some cases.  In those cases, even if it is at risk to the mother, the effort should be made to preserve the life of the infant, over and above the mother's life.  However, if it is reasonably deemed that the mother's life is in jeopardy and she cannot survive to bring the child to the age of viability (which with cutting edge medical techniques is about 5 months), it is morally required to abort.<br>  <br>  What it boils down to:<br>  <br>  The child has greater human potential than the mother, seeing as she is of at least child-bearing age and thus expended some of her potential.<br>  <br>  The ultimate goal of morality should be the greatest increase in human potential.<br>  <br>  In determining the destruction or saving of mother or child, the action which results in the greatest increase or preservation should be the action taken, even if it means the death of the mother.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	yea.

It is based on the concept of theonomy, or rule of the law of God. Christ said that His Kingdom is not of this world.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Republican Party once stood for smaller, less intrusive government, but not anymore. It is certainly not the party I registered to vote with in 1973.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  Dominionism describes, in several distinct ways, a tendency among some conservative politically-active Christians, especially in the United States of America, to seek influence or control over secular civil government through political action—aiming either at a nation governed by Christians, or a nation governed by a conservative Christian understanding of biblical law. The use and application of this terminology is a matter of controversy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the early 1990s, sociologist Sara Diamond[12][13] and journalist Frederick Clarkson[14][15] defined dominionism as a movement that, while including Dominion Theology and Reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian Right.[16] In his 1992 study of Dominion Theology and its influence on the Christian Right, Bruce Barron writes,<br>  <br>      In the context of American evangelical efforts to penetrate and transform public life, the distinguishing mark of a dominionist is a commitment to defining and carrying out an approach to building society that is self-consciously defined as exclusively Christian, and dependent specifically on the work of Christians, rather than based on a broader consensus.[3] (p. 14, emphasis in original)<br>  <br>  According to Diamond, the defining concept of dominionism is "that Christians alone are Biblically mandated to occupy all secular institutions until Christ returns". In 1989, Diamond declared that this concept "has become the central unifying ideology for the Christian Right"[12] (p.138, emphasis in original). In 1995, she called it "prevalent on the Christian Right."[17] Journalist Chip Berlet added in 1998 that, although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists assert a Christian duty to take "control of a sinful secular society."[18]<br>  <br>  In 2005, Clarkson enumerated the following characteristics shared by all forms of dominionism:[19]<br>  <br>      1. Dominionists celebrate Christian nationalism, in that they believe that the United States once was, and should once again be, a Christian nation. In this way, they deny the Enlightenment roots of American democracy.<br>      2. Dominionists promote religious supremacy, insofar as they generally do not respect the equality of other religions, or even other versions of Christianity.<br>      3. Dominionists endorse theocratic visions, insofar as they believe that the Ten Commandments, or "biblical law," should be the foundation of American law, and that the U.S. Constitution should be seen as a vehicle for implementing Biblical principles.[19]|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Yes, as the Republican Parties reliance on big business and social darwinism was not altered the religious leaders with the most clout with the party and thus the most backing were those who promoted prosperity theology at the expense of the traditional Christian mission to the vulnerable.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	I can see that you are a brown nosed Democrat.

Rather, the Republican Party has been destroyed, with a new beast in its place.  Yes, Evangelical Christianity and the GOP entered into unholy marriage and reproduced the beast that you describe.  Yet this beast has another father/mother: racism.<br>  <br>  When LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a major blow to legalized racism, Dixiecrats eventually fled the Democratic Party in favor of the Republican Party, who very gladly reshaped itself to fuel its growth on racism.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, the new GOP head, Michael What's-His-Name, will grow a pair and tell Rush Limbaugh once again where to go, without apologizing this time.

It used to be that Christians<br>  would be found in both parties, equally.  Back then, people both went<br>  to Church but Democrats and Republicans just had different ideas about how the Government should operate: it was really between those<br>  who thought bigger Government was better, and those who thought limited Government was better - BUT MOST WERE GOD BELIEVING,<br>  NORMAL PEOPLE.  Not the idiots, godless and God only knows what we see today - I can tell you without any doubt, that the Democratic<br>  party has been literally taken over by the worst bunch of leftwing<br>  radicals ever known to mankind.  And if you think I'm full of it, just<br>  read the Saul Alinsky "Rules for Radicals" , which is the bible of the<br>  left, and who's points were taught to young communists, socialists and<br>  marxists for at least 5 years by no other than Barack Obama.  In<br>  "Rules for Radicals", Alinsky instructs that radicals must adopt one<br>  of the main two political groups, and that the Democrat Party was the<br>  best choice because as he says "DEMOCRATS ARE EASY PICKINS".<br>  Read it if you have any doubts.  Generally, unless a Democrat doesn't know any better, it is a party of the new and improved godless America-haters with a few left-over nice people who haven't quite caught on yet.  Republicans are those of faith, because obviously anyone who believes in God is not going to be a part of a political party who wants to murder babies outside of the womb at 8 months,<br>  turn over American citizen parental rights to the United Nations, or<br>  teach 7-year old children how dandy it would be to have anal sex with<br>  another little boy.  <br>  What exactly can you not understand about that?  It is only by natural<br>  order that anyone with any kind of conscience would walk away from<br>  the liberal-hijacked democratic party in total and absolute disgust.|`|b62aa03435c366476a024d6636bd1414aa	I think the Republican party used religion to get elected and while they scream for the unborn the children that are here they could care less about.  They have to sound religious to get religions vote but people who are war mongers and want to take from the poor to give to the rich are hardly christian.  When Rush Limbaugh would rather see the government fail then be wrong I think he has attached to much importance to himself.  Not caring about all the children being thrown into the street because their house was foreclosed on.  who cares what gays do, I am sure they don't but need to sound like they care to get elected.  They make issues out of calling an ever green tree a Christmas tree like that is part of their worship and it came from a pagan source.  They pick at small things that do not matter  but TV evangelists insist to be a christian you have to vote Republican and they get to collect millions of tax free dollars and drive around in private jets and fleets of cars.  Donating millions to the Republican campaign.  They keep them in power.  Which both are very corrupt.

bzsnAC7Iaa	What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 15:5 And when he hath found [it], he layeth [it] on his shoulders, rejoicing. <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 15:6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together [his] friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 15:7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <br>  <br>  <br>  The point of the parable is Luk 15:7. I say unto you (The Pharisees)<br>                                                       just persons   (The Pharisees)<br>  <br>  A. The man with the 100 sheep – Christ the Good Shepherd.<br>  B. Lost sheep – backsliders from the faith.<br>  C. Finding the lost sheep – Christ saving sinners.<br>  D. Putting the found sheep on his shoulder – uplifting the fallen.<br>  E. Rejoicing of the shepherd – Christ’s joy when a lost soul is<br>  saved.<br>  III. The bottom line is: There will be great joy in heaven when a lost<br>  soul is found, saved!<br>  Note 3: Jesus is intent on the salvation of every single individual soul!<br>  No exceptions!|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Scripture: Matthew 18:12-14  (see also Luke 15:3-10) <br>  12 What do you think?  If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray?  13 And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. 14  So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. <br>  <br>  Meditation: Do you know what it's like to lose your bearings and to be hopelessly adrift in a sea of uncertainty? To be alone, lost, and disoriented without a sense of direction is one of the worst fears we can encounter. What we would give to have a guide who would show us the way to safety and security, the way to home and family. Scripture comforts us with the assurance that God will not rest until we find our way home to him. The scriptures use the image of a shepherd who cares for his sheep to describe what God is like. God promised that he would personally shepherd his people and lead them to safety (Isaiah 40:11). That is why God sent his only begotten son as the Messiah King who would not only restore peace and righteousness to the land, but who would also shepherd and care for his people with love and compassion. Jesus describes himself as the good shepherd who lays down his life for his sheep (John 10:11). <br>  <br>  What can we learn from the lesson of Jesus' parable about a lost sheep? This parable gives us a glimpse of the heart of a true shepherd, and the joy of a community reunited with its lost members. Shepherds not only had to watch over their sheep by day and by night; they also had to protect them from wolves and lions who preyed upon them, and from dangerous terrain and storms. Shepherds often had large flocks, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or thousands.  It was common to inspect and count the sheep at the end of the day. You can imagine the surprise and grief of the shepherd who discovers that one of his sheep is missing! Does he wait until the next day to go looking for it? Or does he ask a neighboring shepherd if he might has seen the stray sheep? No, he goes immediately in search of this lost sheep. Delay for even one night could mean disaster leading to death. Sheep by nature are very social creatures. An isolated sheep can quickly become bewildered, disoriented, and even neurotic. Easy prey for wolves and lions! <br>  <br>  The shepherd's grief and anxiety is turned to joy when he finds the lost sheep and restores it to the fold. The shepherd  searches until what he has lost is found. His persistence pays off. What was new in Jesus' teaching was the insistence that sinners must be sought out time and time again.  How easy to forget and be distracted with other matters while the lost become prey for devouring wolves of the soul. The Apostle Peter reminds us that the "devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour" (1 Peter 5:8).  God does not rejoice in the loss of anyone, but desires that we be saved and restored to friendship with him. That is why the whole community of heaven rejoices when one sinner is found and restored to fellowship with God. God is on a rescue mission today to save us from the destructive forces of sin and evil. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, watches over every step we take. Do you listen to his voice and heed his wise counsel? Do you follow the path he has set for you - a path that leads to life rather than death? <br>  <br>  "Lord Jesus, nothing escapes your watchful gaze and care. May I always walk in the light of your truth and never stray from your loving presence."|`|kWz0nEdBaa	If ninety-nine sheep are in the sheepfold and one goes astray, the shepherd would look for that particular sheep that got lost.  And he will rejoice with his friends greatly when he finds that sheep.  This is an illustration that the Great Shepherd will look for that one particular sheep, a member of His flock, who gets astray. If I, for example, succumbs to temptation and falls into sin, Jesus would look for me, through His Spirit, convict me of my sin and lead me home to Him in godly sorrow and repentance. The Scriptures tell us that there is great rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repents and turns to God in repentance.

You may like to try this - rather than getting your phone call being blown off, how much better would it be to get a letter with the palace heading on it?  (Something to show your children, maybe...)<br>  Suggest, though, that you have a better reason for writing than simple curiosity.

UPgLy0Ahaa	Good question and reasoning. Thumbs up.<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't teach the false doctrine hell.<br>  It's not a place of eternal punishment of fire, but rather it means the common grave of mankind.<br>  <br>  How someone can come up with the word "ruined" and say it means hellfire is hilarious.<br>  <br>  If my white blouse was washed with a red sock and was ruined, it doesn't mean it is on fire. :0|`|AsyB1qLyaa	I think "perish" is the Biblical word that comes closest to what Hell is really like. An eternal death---you are constantly dying but never coming to the end of the process.|`|6jAVElX7aa	revelations speaks about the second death, that those who blasphemed the Name of our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus will suffer a second death and thrown into the lake of fire|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Reasonable.|`|AA11002471	Sounds very reasonable to me.<br>  The dead are dead, not alive somewhere else.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	You want to be careful about legalism in terminology. As you know, we use expressions like, "this is the life," "that's no kind of life," "stop worrying and start living your life," etc. In each of those cases the word "life" refers to something other than biological life. It would be rash to assume that "eternal life" in this passage is referring exclusively to biological life (or conscious existence as opposed to non-existence).|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	I think that you are very scared to go to hell for eternity after you die, that is why you are trying to convince yourself , that you won't be living forever, but the fact is that everyone who was born , was born into eternity, the soul never dies, it gets a new body, because the old one remains in the grave, but the soul never dies, and there are only two places of choice to go to, heaven or hell...|`|AA10266519	In order to understand the language involved here you must first understand Greek. That's the original language which the Gospels were written. You're confusing physical death with spiritual death. In the end when judgment is set we suffer a second death, a spiritual one eternally. Our physical bodies get resurrected and meet our immoral souls and continue in death for all eternity.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	No offense but your question is born of misunderstandings of meanings of words and translations.  You're hung up on your version of what "perish" means to you versus what the original Greek word meant 2000 years ago.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Perish" in the Bible, doesn't mean "cease to exist". <br>  <br>  "Perish" means "RUINED", and it is another way of saying eternal torment in hell.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Joe B is right.  "Perish" has a variety of meanings in English, especially archaic English.  It can mean to endure extreme privation, degradation, and especially cold.  Not just to cease existing.

0tNCtgzbaa	I don't think they wear high-heels to make them taller they wear it because they like different styles of shoes same as short people who wear flat shoes.|`|46fouwFfaa	No. If they aren't very skinny they often look very good in heels. One of my high school teachers was about 5"11 and she wore heels everyday. Since she was full figured (and not fat or overweight) it actually suited her really well and she is very beautiful.|`|g08ELuNmaa	i feel like they should take it off because this is not a contest about who could be the tallest  i feel like a midget too|`|pDmTRG82aa	if they're wearing the heels to look and feel sexy then okay. but if the heals are really really high then that's just making themselves stand out more than they already should|`|5rraSJRVaa	I feel so small compared to them.

Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

8IyZphFVaa	you're exactly right. and thanks for adding the point about parents being able to donate their children's organs. <br>  the only argument i've heard that makes sense is people who are afraid that corrupt institutions will start performing unwanted abortions. i actually saw a movie about this once. the doctor would make it seem like the woman had a miscarriage but really they were selling fetuses in the black market.|`|QEPC7nveaa	Personally, I believe that once a person dies...they should have no choice what happens to their organs. Why would a person NOT want to contribute to the health of other living people? By donating their organs, they might increase the life span of their own children, cousins, or other relatives!<br>  <br>  The reason why it is immoral is because the fetus cannot choose whether or not it wants research done on it's dead body. Basically, it has no choice in the matter.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	A dead fully developed human usually donates his/her body to science.  They have a choice in the matter as to what happens to their body when they die (under normal circumstances).  I'm afraid that if stem cell research on a fetus is allowed, it will become a 'black market' type issue as organ donation has become.  They have taken organs from people who did not want them taken and then sold them to the highest bidder (on the black market).  I have no reason to believe this would not be the case with the fetus.  So, I have a problem with it.  Just my opinion.

Even though writing this is being judging in itself, ha ha.
LLeQyWGcaa	i wouldn't think you were trying to pick me up i would think you were a Jehovah's witness lady. i would treat man and women both the same is this position. if a women approached me on the street and did want to pick me up, i would have nothing to do with her. i don't think that is normal behavior. i would say basically men would be more apt to listen to the women on the street than a man. i would say a women would be more apt to listen to the women than they would a man also. so the moral of the story, if you are going to send someone out in the street to preach the word of jesus, send a woman, more people would be likely to listen. i think this has to do with man being taught to treat women with respect thus listening and not telling her to buzz off . as far as a tool, i can't imagine using women as tools i guess, but if that's what you want to call them.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	i'd go with the first one, no one ever comes on to me.|`|tManvxfQaa	I believer whether a man or a woman they are to obey God and go to whom they are sent to......But , it must be God sent....not self sent.|`|d8jH5lU1aa	I'll just say that I don't have time to talk about it and it's obviously your witnessing me lol|`|vxSXsn59aa	Trust me, if you approached me on the street and started witnessing, I wouldn't have the slightest interest in picking you up, not even if you were the most physically attractive woman I had ever seen.

It is not a matter of just opening the mouth and saying some religious stuff. We need to learn what we really should be preaching and teaching, we are experts at it. I am conducting 5 Bible studies with people that I witnessed to and my wife is conducting 3 and we're finding more interested people. Mathew 24:14|`|AA11002471	Sex can get in the way.<br>  However, to begin a conversation (woman to man) is not too risky if the woman is dressed modestly and controls her non-verbal communication.<br>  But to further any interest, it should be man to man, or woman to woman.|`|GNeLxx6Caa	Your question is specific but the answer is too broad. There will be guys that will take the opportunity to talk to the girl to see if they can pick her up. There wil be other guys that have their belief and will discuss their belief with the female. Then there will be guys who will be immediately turn off or just don't want to hear what you want to say and keep walking. Then there will be guys who will get angry and be nasty.<br>  <br>  To me the sex would not matter. It does not matter if the person trying to advertise something is a female or male because if the person doesn't want to hear it they will keep on walking. It is no difference than somebody trying to sell you something on the mall or trying to get you to watch a presentation. The only real difference is the nomenclature, that is mall people call it advertising and religious folks call it witnessing. Call it what you will but, is the same thing different product.<br>  <br>  That being said, thee is still a group of people that think leser of females. Some even quote from the bibble where it says a woman shall not speak in church (not an exact quote but is in Levitticus). Yes is sad but, they will not let you know. So your experience wll be the same as approaching somebody at the mall trying to sell them ginsu knifes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Scenarios do matter. If you do it at a campus or main street down town or a mall then is appropriate. If you do it in the middle of the woods I would think the person is crazy. I mean why would anybody want to talk to you in the middle of nowhere? Also, in a bar you will get different reactions. Most people will think of both sexes to be a est because its ruining their entertainment for lack of a better word. Then there are those that are a bit drunk and will try to hit on the girl. You know, try to convert her to the church of horizontal laying. However, if its the man doing the witnessing in a bar full of drunks, then he might get punched in the face plus get kick out for bothering the customers. So, context is important!!!<br>  <br>  Note that big distinction between sexes is really a church thing. This is because most religious pose that there are very important differences and that in most religions, the female is worth less than the man. People outside of religion usually do not think this way. They think in terms of yes, there are difference between sexes but not in an inferior or superior way. For example in sports. Men are stronger but female are better at endurance. For example, where I go to my martial art practice there are girls I now I can win against in a fight. Well, there are a few than can kick my btt. However, the ones that I reffer to may be smaller and physically weaker but, they have better conditioning. When I'm gasping for air they are not even braking a sweat. So, in reality is all about how much effort and time you put into something not about I'm a male therefore better at X or Y because I say so. <br>  <br>      Let us not fool ourselves. There is still sexism in this world. But, little by little is going away.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	you have no right ethically or morally to push your beliefs on to others.<br>  i would ignore you for trying to foist your beliefs on me.<br>  believe what you wish i accept that it is your choice ~just don't preach to me.<br>  travel lifes highway safely may the road be long.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Why do they call it witnessing?

12ALQ3Qhaa	bicuriously taken the first step towards being gay|`|qTRzRi8gaa	K, I just have one question.  You say you're more attracted to women yet the prospect of sleeping with another man is seen as slightly more arousing.  I assume you mean 'attraction' in an emotional sense, then?<br>  <br>  If so, these things can change.  For example, I'm gay, but when I was first coming to terms with it, I never saw men as emotionally attractive.  I always thought women were more appealing on an emotional basis, and men on a sexual basis.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure why that is, maybe it was my own internalized homophobia.  Simply screwing a dude seems like a lesser admission of guilt than admitting you could possibly *love* one.  So sexual feelings, sure, I could admit to that.  But deeper affection?  Hell no, that scared the hell out of me.<br>  <br>  Then I grew out of it, and now I only see men as emotionally appealing.  Women don't appeal to me in the least on an emotional basis, and I don't identify with that I described previously at all, anymore.<br>  <br>  After all, there are all sorts of men, all sorts of personalities.  Some men have somewhat 'feminine' personalities, etc, and some women have somewhat 'masculine' personalities, etc.  People come in all types, so now I see it was kind of silly to think I couldn't be emotionally attracted to a man.  As if all men are the same!<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that is the situation for you in the least, it's just a point to consider.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes we're more emotinally attracted to certain types simply because those are the social values that we absorb.  We're not aware of it because those social values penetrate so deeply into us that we're not even aware of the power they exert over us.<br>  <br>  Ultimately you have to decide, though.  See what is out there and explore things with an open mind.  Test yourself, test everything, keep an open mind, and the truth will come.

Hwe4MA6Faa	Ash Wednesday is a day of repentance and it marks the beginning of Lent. Ashes were used in ancient times, according to the Bible, to express mourning. Dusting oneself with ashes was the penitent's way of expressing sorrow for sins and faults. An ancient example of one expressing one's penitence is found in Job 42:3-6. Job says to God: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." (vv. 5-6, KJV) Other examples are found in several other books of the Bible including, Numbers 19:9, 19:17, Jonah 3:6, Matthew 11:21, and Luke 10:13, and Hebrews 9:13.<br>  <br>  However, some Adventists who do not celebrate Ash Wednesday say that the practice is not consistent with Scripture and is of pagan origin.[13] They usually cite Matthew 6:16–18, where Jesus gave prescriptions for fasting: "And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (NRSV) These groups argue that Jesus warned against fasting to gain favor from other people and that he also warned his followers that they should fast in private, not letting others know they were fasting. For these reasons, some Christian denominations do not endorse the practice. Others, however, point out that this very passage from Matthew is the one, not coincidentally, that is appointed by the Revised Common Lectionary to be read on Ash Wednesday. They might also clarify that the ashen Cross on the forehead does not represent the fast, but the mortal (fallen) condition of human existence. And they would refer to Jesus' words whereby he expected people to repent using sackcloth and ashes: "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes." (Luke 10:13; see also Matthew 11:21)<br>  <br>  <br>  Palm ash is used as when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey for Passover, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah, palm leaves were hailed at him and put below his feet to welcome him.<br>  So therefore signifying that Jesus' grace has saved our mortal souls.<br>  <br>  edit: Its your coworkers way of mourning her sins and remembering her Earthly mortality.<br>  We will all be ash one day.|`|LUiiAlsJaa	because it makes us look funny|`|SCahlH1raa	i think it was when jesus stubbed a cigar out on pontius pilots forehead.

AA11232725	Only Christians born again by the Spirit of God, whom according to the Bible are the only true Christians in God's eyes are guaranteed Heaven.<br>  <br>  Romans 8:9  But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 1:13  In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,  14  who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.<br>  <br>  Apostate Christians and the circumstances surrounding their apostasy were compared and contrasted with true believers by the Lord Jesus in this passage along with others like the end of Matthew 25 and Matthew 7:21-23<br>  <br>  Luke 8:11  "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.  12  Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.  13  But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.  14  Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.  15  But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.|`|FO1XCZc4aa	The teachings and morals of Christ are the consciousness we should aspire to follow not the experience of finding it out (the story)<br>  Hell is probably your conscience|`|VncSMLMpaa	No. Jesus Christ, the son of God went to heaven to be at the right hand of his Father. We are not offered that. We are offered resurrection to eternal life if we are faithful and obedient.<br>  <br>  Nobody seems to have noticed that when Jesus taught the disciples how to pray he said "Thy kingdom come," No one had gone to heaven until Jesus was taken up. We are told that our breath goes and that we sleep the sleep of death until resurrection.<br>  <br>  Jesus' friend Lazarus, brother to Mary and Martha.,died, Jesus first expressed it as a sleep then had to explain to his disciples that Lazarus was indeed dead. Jesus wept. Lazarus had gone nowhere except to his grave where he had been wrapped in grave clothes as was normal.<br>  <br>  When Jesus suggested to Mary and Martha that he would go and see Lazarus' tomb they were horrified and said that by now he stinketh. Jesus went with them all and called Lazarus forth. He came, still wrapped about in his grave clothes and they had to release him. Did Lazarus say he had been in heaven? No. Did Lazarus say why did you bring me back to this world? No. He had been in the unconsciousness of death.<br>  <br>  Psalm 115<br>  17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.  <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes. 9<br>  5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Not all Christian's but the sincere one's ...who love God (Jesus) and are born again :)|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	I always find it puzzling that god could form hundreds of "religions" yet proclaim Christianity (or any other religion) as the "chosen" religion.<br>  <br>  Heaven guaranteed?

There have been several mass murderers, rapists, genociders, etc. who describe themselves as 'Christian.' I don't think that God would allow them into heaven. Obviously, there is no proof that Christianity triumphs over other religions. It sickens me that Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, etc. try to say that their religion is right and that others are wrong. We really need to focus on the bigger picture, which is loving God (or gods) and honoring him by being a person of integrity. THAT will guarantee you a place in heaven. And hey, even if you are an atheist, the one fundamental law of humanity is to be a good person, right?|`|BlA60kDVaa	What are you on about?

Christianity as it is today is full of paganistic rituals and has gone very far away from the original message of Jesus, which was to worship the ONE God.

Z4avhg3eaa	If you look through the Pali Canon, you'll notice a lot of things that seem to conflict with each other.  So, on the face of it, it looks like many of these teachings can stand alone. If you look more closely, you'll see that they all revolve around the same theme: suffering and the end of suffering. The Buddha's teachings are telescopic that way: 7 factors of enlightenment fit in the 8 fold path, and the 8 fold path fits on the 4 Noble Truths. <br>  <br>  Where the teachings seem to conflict, the Buddha, to my understanding, is trying to get his audience away from one extreme or another, and sometimes, different audiences sit on different extremes. <br>  <br>  So you have teachings that talk about relying and trusting in elders, while other teachings talk about not believing anything just because tradition and teachers say so. <br>  <br>  Some teachings talk about being a light unto oneself, while others talk about faith in the enlightenment of the Buddha.<br>  <br>  And so on. <br>  <br>  The idea is to get people onto the middle way, and away from various extremes.<br>  <br>  EDIT--To add to British's statement (he's right about the meditation statement), the practice is a package deal. You can perform various elements alone, but without the supporting factors of the rest of the Eightfold Path, you've hobbled yourself.|`|pevh5EiSaa	While virtually any of the Buddhas teachings can stand alone, none , in itself can lead you to the end of suffering.<br>  As an example, there are many teachings that speak of Emptiness, but even knowing everything there is to know about emptiness, one can never truly REALIZE emptiness wihthout meditation.<br>  Without truly realizing Emptiness, one can never reach the end of suffering.<br>  However, all Dharma , no matter what the size or form of it ( meditation, sutra, mantra etc..) can eventually lead to the end of suffering because any exposure to the Dharma sets one off on the path; it may take many lifetimes, but once it is set in motion it will continue to grow and the draw to the Dharma will increase as time goes.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Some can stand on their own. <br>  <br>  For example, the doctrine of anatta can stand without the rest of the doctrine. Karma can as well.<br>  <br>  However, the four noble truths must be together, as must the eightfold path.|`|AyRczfSCaa	well i know many people  who take only part of it..<br>  <br>  In fact very few persons are able to practise ALL of the 84000 teachings given by the historical Buddha !|`|yOK32PM9aa	The latter.  He said so repeatedly.  However, practicing meditation without some of the other elements of the eightfold path usually leads to disappointing results for many who just want to "calm the mind", etc.
9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	What I dislike most about religion is the tendency of some religious followers to believe that they alone know what their god likes and dislikes, and therefore they try to force everyone around them to conform to those beliefs.  Abortion and gay marriage are a couple examples in America.|`|wwdllMzYaa	probably the propaganda that they spread and teach as truth about other peopel, belifs and religions|`|yHfsHp6naa	Like you basically said, religion is inherently immoral, but the thing I like the least is the influence of religious nonsense and immorality in our laws and society.|`|AA11135281	I don't mind being referred to as "unchurched."

In short, I dislike it when people force their religion upon others.  And, though they deny it, some religious people DO force their religions upon others.|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	My problem with religion (I am an irreligious agnostic) is that theists of all religions (but particularly Christians in the U.S.A.) endeavor to legislate their religious beliefs into law when our Constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion, provides for the separation of church and state.  If those who are fundamentalist theists were to prevail, freedom of religion or non-religion would no longer exist.  And the theists are indefatigable in their desires to amend the Constitution to reflect their narrow-minded viewpoints.  In the Middle East and in Southeast Asia where Islamic theocracies are the norm, women have no rights, are treated as chattel, are often subjected to terrorist attacks by their own husbands, and with impunity, solely based upon religious dogma.  What sort of God condones such actions?  A benevolent god would not be exclusionary, and, having presumably possessed the genius to create a Cosmos, would not then be vengeful and pedantic.

Otherwise, there's not just the gf, but a baby on the way.|`|0NYQNr9saa	I'd stay as far away from the guy as possible, he was flirting with you when he has a girlfriend, if you two ended up getting together he'd probably do the same to another girl.<br>  The baby situation just makes it worse, do you really want to get into such a mess?<br>  Avoid at all costs!

EMhWXqbnaa	Well no, it's not like the "h" in house, but many foreign speakers of German pronounce it like this or worse. It's no problem if you can't pronounce it, but at least it should be explained correctly in order to try ...<br>  And it's not "ikh", either!<br>  <br>  Here are some sound clips you can listen to (click on the blue triangle to start):<br>  <a href="http://forvo.com/word/ich/" rel="nofollow">http://forvo.com/word/ich/</a><br>  <a href="http://forvo.com/word/dich/" rel="nofollow">http://forvo.com/word/dich/</a><br>  <br>  The German "ch" does not exist in English. Neither the one of the sound clips above, nor the one that follows, because there are two different kinds:<br>  <a href="http://forvo.com/word/machen/" rel="nofollow">http://forvo.com/word/machen/</a> <br>  <br>  When doing the "ch" you let pass some air through your mouth, your tongue does not touch above, but nearly. The sounds comes from the part where the "hill" of your upper part of your mouth goes down (I'm sorry for this explanation, my English is not that good.) Try to sound like a snake. =)<br>  <br>  The site above is really good, but if you're searching a word have a look at the ratings which mostly are correct. Some pronounciatins are so good.|`|i8yanqUAaa	The "ch" is pronounced like the "h" in e.g. house.<br>  Do you know how to talk spanish?<br>  Maybe you know the name "Juan" or "Jorge", than you pronounce it like the "J".

You're over thinking this. And straight people aren't ruining anything. If it weren't for straight parents you wouldn't be alive my friend.
ugMlQN1haa	Ignore her, or when she makes comments like that say " I'm sorry, but I really don't appreciate that comment" Be polite but at the same time speak YOUR mind<br>  or if she says, "want to hold my purse" <br>  say excuse me? That's a bit rude. <br>  You can also say, "you don't have to be rude to me"<br>  or even say, "I like you, but I don't like to joke around like that, please don't do it again" <br>  Stand up for yourself, you sound a bit passive. <br>  I don't get along with my exein lawsws for that very reason, I NEVER let them insult me. Even when im not there, I tell him "Well you better tell you mother that..." <br>  If worst come to worst, tell your inlaws, that that b!Cth makes you feel uncofortable and she's always saying catty remarks to you. <br>  <br>  MAINLY, forget about them direct your attention to your boyfriend, he'll be there for you, but if you make a big deal out of that stuck up girl he'll notice her, not you. Good luck.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Have your inlaws visit you .. don't visit them.<br>  Then you can avoid all their friends.
FpMS47sXaa	No. I believe that there are ways to separate that are not as damaging to the children. If handled correctly, I think the children can be ok in the long run.<br>  <br>  I come from a broken home. My parents certainly did not do it in the right way, I ended up paying for it. But, that's what therapy is for, I suppose.|`|AA12158476	Children should never be the reason for an unhappy couple to stay together. All that will do is build resentment in them toward their relationship with their parents. It could very easily make them feel as though they are the blame for your unhappiness. Children should remain as innocent as long as they can and never be a pawn in relationship issues.|`|po4j4xhAaa	No. Children can sense the unhappiness, and that makes them unhappy also.  A couple should break up and take into consideration the well-being of the children during the break-up process AND afterward.  For the sake of the children, the break up should be done with respect; and the care and living arrangements of the children need to be considered carefully.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	I don't think staying in a relationship that has no hope of true reconciliation is a good example for children or creates a loving environment for them.  I would not give up as easily on fixing a relationship if there were children involved, but ultimately, if the relationship cannot be fixed, it is best for everyone to end it.|`|11UC8GcGaa	definately not to the point to where you two are fighting......it would be even more unfair for the child to watch his two parents fight.....|`|yoS4cAszaa	I think if you are unhappy you should just separate. I don't think your kid would want to see constant fighting anyway. I don't think anyone deserves to be miserable.|`|sJuwdIHSaa	Not happy could have a wide range of meaning. The answer becomes dependent on the meaning.  You can have an amicable relationship (brother/ sister) and not fight.  If there is abuse that's the other end of the spectrum. My parents were not happy with each other but they stayed together. My children would be devastated if I left. I know because we went through it once. <br>  It's all about relationships.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	Depends entirely. Do you think it would harm the children more to see a couple abuse each other (verbally or physically) , or to have parents that are separated? Are they staying together until the children move out? or forever? I would imagine it hurts as much whether you're grown or young, although when you're grown maybe they can rationalize it better.

It sounds like a whiskey brand!! <br>  <br>  The next time she does this, don't react violently, just look at her and say "well I guess it takes one to know one", then see how it goes. <br>  If she keeps on bothering you tell your teacher.|`|RB0ICpJCaa	Truthfully I would have snapped and most likely started a fight. I don't put up with crap like that. I say what is on my mind, and usually ends up with fists flying. But luckily I have training, so a lot of girls that do stupid stuff, back of when I speak my mind.|`|t8OM0APyaa	If she does it again swing to hit her back across her head. Do NOT hit her. If she tries it a 3rd time, dont forget to follow through.|`|dXZdcrTeaa	I would say at some point she had to of been thinking of your butt so maybe she likes you. Even if she thought of it just that Second b4 she hit it. That's just my opinion.  let me tell you what I would do I would bring it up to the teacher. you don't want to react in a negative way this could easily turn into sexual harassment or a hate crime. gays have come a long way we don't want to take a step back or make us look bad. cause if I was to retaliate without thinking I would have said something like hay baby didn't know you like my *** so much. Just to make her so nerves that she never dose it again. Then I would get in trouble. lol. That's just my luck. So just make sure you think b4 you act. you don't want something bad on your school records.

Noise pollution isn't much of a problem where I live.|`|b32jC7pGaa	They do mess up a good Sunday morning sleep in. So, like loud mufflers, they should be reported.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	No bells where I live.|`|xrl96EHTaa	I'm not worried about church bells.

If they thought they were wrong or could be wrong, the religion would fall away.  The more convincing a religion, the more followers it will have.<br>  <br>  Also, people assume that because many people believe something that it must be right.  How can so many be wrong?  There is a sense of rightness in the idea of strength of numbers.  <br>  <br>  A person who has been bold and found for their own selves the truth they desire do not have a need to convince others that they are right.  They see clearly from a state of love.  This love allows others to grow and learn to see what they will see in their own time.|`|PafAZ66Haa	Well I am one and i can tell you that they (me also) have been taught this their entire life and they believe in it.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

p2G5KJywaa	It tells me that the flood story is a universal epic that is probably based on actual events. It is a fact that sea levels rose 400-500 feet after the last ice age. It is also true that most civilizations live near the coast. Obviously there were many people displaced by rising waters. It is also true that many low laying areas flooded rapidly and many people drowned and entire societies submerged. Prior to this flooding the coast lines were at the continental shelves. Huge seas filled lowlands where civilizations once existed.<br>  The Hebrew Bible is obviously a collection of stories written to <br>  "teach" it's people, record historic events and even genealogies. Some of these stories are variations of earlier folklore adopted and retold as their own.<br>  Okay, a man existed who survived a great flood and his name was....what does it matter what his "real" name was?<br>  There are as many flood stories as there have been civilizations, including "New World" societies.<br>  <br>  Even Jesus disputed and argued with the Rabbis on various subjects in the Bible. <br>  He didn't take it literally why should I?<br>  <br>  Follow His example on how to live and forgive. When you have a question refer to the New Testament, not the old.

They preach a false gospel and 'perform' many miracles. I am so amazed how easily people are sucked in by these people. They get very rich don't they?<br>  <br>  One of the 'traights of the false church' as written in the book of Revelations is that the 'evil one' will come in power and will mislead many even performing many miracles. Often Christians avoid the book of revelations as it seems so complicated but read in the light of today it makes total sense .The  passage below from the book of revelations seens to speak of a one world order will come about one day.. It is interesting that because of identify fraud etc. nowadays I feel sure that one day we will all have the 'mark of the beast' in the form of a micro  chip (used even now on dogs etc) which will be like a mini computer in our bodies with all our details on it including bank details criminal records etc. 666 is the number of the beast - Hebrew names were made up of numbers and the 666 represents humanism which is where most of the world is at now - me me me! An identity chip may seem far out and wild, but it is not an impossible scenario in this day and age is it?  and seems to be the only explaination for the mark of the beast on the wrists and foreheads of humans.  Not all Christians go along with these 'super hero evangelists' and sadly I have many debates with my christian friends about this- who go along to these meetings. Thousands now throng to these evangelistic healers and I truly think it is evil behind the healings. To Christian friends who think these people are sent from God. I say that one hardly reads of any mass miracles after the death of Christ. I am sure if there had been it would have been mentioned by one of the apostles but they are odly silent - only saying that if one is sick one should go to the elders of the church, be annointed by oil and they will be healed.  When I debate with some of my friends who believe in this 'evil agents' I read them a few verses from Revelations 13<br>  <br>  11) Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. 12) He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 13) And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. 14) Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 15) He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 16) He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, 17) so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. <br>  <br>  After all who would have believed five years ago that we would have such a world wide economic crisis?   I did read a book written in 1997 which was apparently a prophesy given to a couple of Christians which warned of this present day crisis. entitled 'Earthquake in the city'. I totally believed it all and told many people who actually scoffed at me and are now intrigued to read the book. As written one should be as wise as serpents but as gentle as doves.  Don't be sucked in by all we see and hear. Website below  for earthquake in the city.|`|shcnDVHsaa	BURN LOSASHA!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm kidding, even she doesn't deserve to die.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	OH SNAP!

It added: "Hell exists, not as a place but as a state, a way of being of the person who suffers the pain of the deprivation of God." Pope John Paul II said in 1999: "Rather than a place, hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy." As to the images of hell as a fiery place, he said: "They show the complete frustration and emptiness of life without God." Had the pope described hell in terms of "flames and a red-suited devil with a pitchfork," church historian Martin Marty said, "people wouldn't take it seriously."
aKEK24o4aa	SCORPIO AND AQUARIUS <br>  Scorpio makes heavy emotional demands, but to Aquarius even a love affair is simply another way to broaden its horizons. Scorpio can't tolerate Aquarius's independence within a relationship or understand Aquarius's casual air toward love. Aquarius is altogether too impersonal and has too many outside interests to suit possessive, jealous Scorpio. Scorpio will try to dominate and will be upset by Aquarius's unpredictable moods and love for freedom. Scorpio wants to stay at home; Aquarius wants to be free to go.

R49w1Dr7aa	You have a very longgggggggggggg way to go.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	1695 "Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God," "sanctified . . . [and] called to be saints," Christians have become the temple of the Holy Spirit. This "Spirit of the Son" teaches them to pray to the Father and, having become their life, prompts them to act so as to bear "the fruit of the Spirit" by charity in action. Healing the wounds of sin, the Holy Spirit renews us interiorly through a spiritual transformation. He enlightens and strengthens us to live as "children of light" through "all that is good and right and true."|`|rWP4suXuaa	The word saint comes from the Greek word "hagios" which means “consecrated to God, holy, sacred, pious." It is almost always used in the plural, “saints.” "…Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem" (Acts 9:13). "Now as Peter was traveling through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda" (Acts 9:32). "And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons … “(Acts 26:10). There is only one instance of the singular use and that is "Greet every saint in Christ Jesus…" (Philippians 4:21). In Scripture there are 67 uses of the plural “saints” compared to only one use of the singular word “saint.” Even in that one instance, a plurality of saints is in view “…every saint…” (Philippians 4:21).<br>  <br>  The idea of the word “saint” is a group of people set apart for the Lord and His kingdom. There are three references referring to godly character of saints; "that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints …" (Romans 16:2). "For the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ" (Ephesians 4:12). "But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints" (Ephesians 5:3).<br>  <br>  Therefore, Scripturally speaking, the “saints” are the body of Christ, Christians, the church. All Christians are considered saints. All Christian are saints…and at the same time are called to be saints. 1 Corinthians 1:2 states it clearly, “To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy…” The words “sanctified” and “holy” come from the same Greek root as the word that is commonly translated “saints.” Christians are saints by virtue of their connection with Jesus Christ. Christians are called to be saints, to increasingly allow their daily life to more closely match their position in Christ. This is the Biblical description and calling of the saints.<br>  <br>  How does the Roman Catholic understanding of “saints” compare with the Biblical teaching? Not very well. In Roman Catholic theology, the saints are in Heaven. In the Bible, the saints are on earth. In Roman Catholic teaching, a person does not become a saint unless he/she is “beatified” or “canonized” by the Pope or prominent bishop. In the Bible, everyone who has received Jesus Christ by faith is a saint. In Roman Catholic practice, the saints are revered, prayed to, and in some instances, worshipped. In the Bible, saints are called to revere, worship, and pray to God alone.|`|RyhluHk3aa	Believe in the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.|`|kX0T1urdaa	In order to invite Jesus to be your Savior and Lord, you must believe in you heart that He is the Son of God, believe that He died upon the cross of Calvary as an atonement for your wrong doings, and believe that He arose from death and the grave.

My best friend got together with Another girl! I was devastated! I ran to her home and asked her what was wrong with her, and how could she not have noticed that I liked her? Her answer was that she thought we had only been 'messing around'. It was the worst day of my life, as I thought I had lost both my best friend and my love all in one day (two years later we are best friends again and everything is fine, and our friendship is stronger than ever.)<br>  <br>  In all this devastation I told all of my other friends and my brother because I was too upset to care anymore, and they all took it really well and haven't treated me any differently at all since they found out, and I was actually very surprised by that, but very thankful as well :)!|`|bAUO9Yhdaa	I've never really had much of a problem, but I got very lucky.

Being free of these delusions, you may actually find searching for a greater God to be both enlightening, and ultimately rewarding.<br>  <br>  Retreating back to blind faith is an abandonment of your responsibility to seek the truth, even if you find it uncomfortable in the beginning.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	The thoughts and doubts that you are experiencing are common.  To jump start your relationship with God become active in your church or find a good Bible based church.    Become involved in your church and its daily workings.  Help with ushering.  Help with pot luck meals.  Help with clean up day.  You will fill your life with Christian friends, thoughts and deeds.  In doing this you will push out the deeds of the flesh and its lustful self serving desires.  Remember, our every thought should concern our God and others and not gratifying the lusts of the flesh.   You will feel as though you belong to one another and depend and care for one another.  You will feel loved and you will seek to prosper others ahead of your own concerns.<br>      Today, society tells us that would should aspire to become the full pattern of pop culture.  To attain beauty, wealth and status.  To put on a show of  '"look at me and how I have it all together".   But the way of God is to seek Him with all of your might and to do His work in caring of the less fortunate than ourselves.<br>  Dont give up.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	you just have to ask GOD for forgiveness and turn away from your sins....even though you may not feel forgiven you will be...but you must stay strong in faith and stay on the path of righteousness....it is a narrow path|`|7P3TSjaZaa	Attend an LDS church.

I felt awkward finding a new church, I felt like a stranger a Bible study, and I felt like an awful person when I did did something wrong. It's a tough process and while you can always start by praying more often and reading your Bible, I thought that the hardest part was the social end, finding a new church, going to some kind of study, meeting new people, and turning my life around to better serve God. Just remember that it is ok to leave your comfort zone and remember that no matter what God is there to keep you in line and guide you along the way, all you have to do is pray and ask for the guidance! Things will be a-ok!!|`|AA12163032	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. ~ 1 John 1:9<br>  <br>  That right there is a promise.  God cannot break his promises (Titus 1:2).  If you can't rest on what can do, then rest on what God cannot do.  God cannot lie.  So when he promises that he will forgive you if you turn to Him, then it is a 100% guaranteed fact.<br>  <br>  So first start with repentance through prayer to God.  Confess your sins to Him and he is willing to forgive.<br>  <br>  Then....<br>  Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God. ~ Matthew 4:4<br>  <br>  Have you ever survived for many days without food?

w8uUWK03aa	OK, you may want to give this relationship a bit more time before you make any hasty decisions which you may later regret.  Entering serious relationships is a serious thing, especially if it's new ground for either of you.  <br>  <br>  After some time together, you will probably want to reassess the situation with him and see if you are both on the same track.  If you are not, you need to decide whether a compromise is acceptable.  Who knows, may be given some more time, you will both want to be out and proud and even get married... hard luck if you're in the USA!|`|QklWVYbLaa	respect his decisions.

Once such volume known as the Doctrine and Covenants speaks about this very topic in section 76.<br>  <br>  "23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father— <br>    24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.

hP7edhKYaa	Allah and only Allah. Just thinking of him<br>  <br>  It gets tough I know but honestly sometimes i just dnt care about all this stuff.. short skirts, make-up, guys. << I dont care about it period. So what I wear a skirt or take off hijab? not gonna get me happiness :P<br>  My only inner peace will be from Allah's way of life he has ordered. Even though its hard... we all know its the best way.. :P no other way.<br>  <br>  My only struggle is my self Jihad and striving to be a better muslim. And thats wat we shud aim for. No point wanting it and just talking about it (as I have learnt from experience) U gota go and do it. Do ur prayers. Do ur fasts and follow the rules and inshallah hope to get the reward. Not only will u inshallah get a reward, but it will make u a stronger muslim<br>  <br>  But i think for those who are struggling.. we shud stick together. When u see another muslim in the street, dnt be scared to say "salaam alaikum" as u pass by. Do it! =D its a sign of our religion, like a secret code word. knowing that another muslim is there. U know when u sometimes walk past someone like an old person and u smile? its kinda like that. For all u know that muslim is feeling alone or bullied by otehrs becuase they are "different" and just by you giving them a salaam when u walk past or a warm smile as u randomly cross can really change someones day. There has been days where Im sad and im on the street and someone just walks past and smiles at me.. it makes me feel better.xD<br>  <br>  This is something that bugs me actually. I think thats the main problem that as a ummah *esp. in the west* people are too embarresed to be "islamic" towards eachother. Honestly the way some "muslims" act around their non-muslim friends scare me. I hope never to be like that inshallah. And even when some muslims are with other muslims. Honestly if I knew some good muslims *not many muslims where I live* I wud say salaam alaikum to them where ever possible even infront of all the non-muslims at school. I try.. I really do. <br>  <br>  I would say to anyone thats "embarresed" to: Stick together and dnt be ashamed. U now ur on the true path.

Either you live as a hypocrite, that is you only follow the bits and pieces of islam that is compatible to modernity, or you give up islam completely, that is you become an apostate.<br>  <br>  Just to clarify, when I say Islam, I mean the islam that is taught by the Quran and the sahih hadiths, not the islam of most muslims, or your version of islam, or the islam taught at your local mosque, although there are overlaps.<br>  <br>  You say islam teaches peace, but the Quran says fight until islam reign supreme.<br>  <br>  Sura (9:29) - "Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued."<br>  <br>  Suicide is HARRAM(totaly forbidden) in Islam, that is true. No one disputes that, not even the terrorists. However, dying when fighting for the cause of Allah guarantees a spot in paradise. So, they are not committing suicide, but they are dying while fighting, that is the difference.<br>  <br>  Sura (9:111) - "Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme."<br>  <br>  Killing innocents is HARRAM(totaly forbidden), that is true. Again, no one is disputing that, not even the terrorists. However, killing infidels is not forbidden, in fact, it is every muslim's duty.<br>  <br>   Sura (3:151) - "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority".<br>  <br>  Sura (8:12) - "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"<br>  <br>  Sura (4:89) - "They (infidels) but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."<br>  <br>  Islam dervies from the root word, slm meaning peace and islm meaning submission - (Not peace) just submission to the will of God. That again is true. Every islamic fundamentalist, or terrorist will tell you the same thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  One of the quotations that you gave, you cited the WRONG sura. It should be 2.256. Let me show you the full verse<br>  <br>  002.256-257<br>  Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the EVIL ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the FIRE, to dwell therein (For ever). <br>  <br>  So, basically, what Allah is saying here is that muslims will be blessed and infidels will be cursed. Don't take the "no compulsion in religion" out of context.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  "Ask an athiest/christian/muslims/lecturer/ whoever, even an elementary student what he thinks of it and he'll tell you it's basically saying don't force religion, the truth is apparent from wrong."<br>  <br>  I'm not denying that. Maybe I got you wrong/misunderstood your intentions when quoting this verse. What was your point again when quoting this verse?<br>  <br>  Ah...you see that is not the point of what 2:256-257 is saying. Yes, the first sentence say you cannot force someone, but it goes on to say those that choose to be muslim will be blessed while those that reject islam are the EVIL ones and will be sentenced to hell for eternity. So the main point of the verse is Allah condemning the infidels to hell forever.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  You can believe in answering-christianity (its amazing the amount of logical twisting they do), but again I said that my definition of islam is only the Quran and the sahih hadiths. If you have a different version of islam, I'm sorry. If you think the Quran is a red-herring, its okay for me.

We can't express anything even if it is a  rhetorical question, we cannot embrace spirituality for being called a non believer.  we cannot study other faiths and compare with  our own because in each case there will be someone else standing right behind us telling us, reminding us of how wrong we are.

mVTGl6HGaa	Mestizo is the common word used to describe multiracial people in Latin America, especially people with Amerindian and Spanish or other European ancestry. Mestizos make up a large portion of Latin Americans including a majority in some countries.<br>  <br>  In Latin America, racial mixture was officially acknowledged from colonial times. There was official nomenclature for every conceivable mixture present in the various countries. Initially, this classification was used as a type of caste system, where rights and privileges were accorded depending on one's official racial classification. Official caste distinctions were abolished in many countries of the Spanish-speaking Americas as they became independent of Spain. Several terms have remained in common usage.<br>  <br>  Race and racial mixture have played a significant role in the politics of many Latin American countries. In some countries, notably Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Belize, a majority of the population can be described as biracial or multiracial (depending on the country).<br>  <br>  The Mexican philosopher and educator José Vasconcelos authored an essay on the subject, La Raza Cósmica, celebrating racial mixture. Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, who is himself of Spanish, indigenous and African ancestry, has made positive references to the mixed-race ancestry of most Latin Americans from time to time.

They may ask you to run it by someone else to be sure.<br>  <br>  When you have approval from some that is able to make the decision, send the emails.  <br>  <br>  If you have no approval, don't send anything.|`|xnsU60hhaa	You need to ask your supervisor or manager.

Do not mix your personal life and your business life via email.  I would be super ticked if someone did that to me.|`|WuhIoS1laa	Absolutely NOT. <br>  <br>  People are spammed at all turns these days.  Years ago someone in my company sent out an e-mail to everyone in the area asking about a non-work activity and everyone started to 'reply all'.  At first, they were responses to the e-mail itself, but then it became responses about all the responses. It mushroomed. <br>  <br>  Weeks later, the e-mails trickled out, but it's something that should never have happened.  <br>  <br>  You, as listmum, have a responsibility to moderate the list. That means keeping people's classified ads and other off topic spam off it.  Because it's a work related one, it will be doubly unappreciated, and may cost you professionally.|`|rThIVk2maa	No, it is not appropriate and may even be illegal.

6pTIspQlaa	Hey. Your question has a few different parts to it. I'm assuming your talking about a close personal relationship(possibly living together, if not my apologies). That said lets start: misunderstandings usually happen when two people have different ideas or end results on a certain outcome or event. These are the ones that strike deeper emotionally, because your both connected emotionally to that specific outcome you wanted. But once realized you had different ideas on the end result. Blaming each other for not knowing ensues. <br>  Ultimately, if you are looking to avoid conflict, than you will not be yourself. If you feel a certain way about something. Say it when the time is right. If this creates more conflict than you need to look at the relationship you have with this person. And figure out what your really getting out of it. It can be very complicated, but if you cut through the Bull, you'll see whats right for you.|`|eLctAJyyaa	next time, i wouldnt have been such a ridiculous drama queen that i am...<br>  so take it from me, if you feel like sometimes you coulda been just "a little" bit more relaxed (lets say) after a fight, think about that next time you have a fight and try to cool down...<br>  <br>  let me know if it works.... ; )

And great was its fall.” <br>   And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching,  for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:24-29|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	It's called evidence.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	To distinguish illusion from truth, put down your Bible and go out and see the world.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Evidence for what is objective, and for the subjective things... well, there is no difference between illusion and truth there.|`|OhhKRahTaa	Evidence.|`|GaBsQacmaa	Read Palms 3:5-6 and James 1:5-6.In the Bible. It was all the proof i needed! When you read it be in a quiet place where you can be alone. Then follow James council. I know that God does live and that he cares about us and loves us. It's just you have to open the door and let him in. I know that he not only created us but that we are his children. That, he is our father, and he sent us here on this earth to be tested, just as he was. I don't believe in God and Jesus I KNOW they live and love each and everyone of us. I believe that God does grant us with 'hints' or 'clues' that there is some thing more especially when we are doubting. I hope you find what your soul desires, nothing is a greater feeling than that of knowing for your self that God lives and Loves you! I say these things because of my faith and love in our Savior, Lord and Redeemer, our brother Jesus Christ. Amen.|`|cNniG2L0aa	"us they saw Jesus, or had a near death experience, we are still left with doubt... If God is real, he's probably too busy watching watching the other billions of people on the planet than to appear to me, but then again, he's everywhere right? Nah, I don't think I believe in god... Who knows, though what if there were other intelligent lifeforms in the universe more evolved than ourselves, would we view them as gods? And where will worship ultimately lead us but into slavery... Even if you didn't worship a "god", you could still be their friend, or not if you didn't choose to, but what kind of being would demand worship? By demanding this, this being would create a rebellious spirit among us and cause us to be curious of other possibilities... It seems the only way for us to be happy is to be more free, not just religion wise, but also how we live our lives... Like how we have ridiculous laws in place, but they don't stop people, they make them either afraid or rebellious, two negatives don't make a positive... I have never seen a third eye vision either, or had any of that stuff, but for what it's worth, once I am sure I have heard something ghostly, like a laughing and/or screaming inside my head after having four dreams in a row about what is commonly called a banshee, not that anyone died that I know of but it certainly gave me the sense that there's more to the world than meets the eye. I don't expect you to believe this, as long as you have doubt, and a wise person doubts often, you will keep searching.

Is she in a situation where the people she lies to don't notice or care?  That's sad but not serious stuff.  However, A lack of remorse is a trait of a sociopath.  There are other traits.  Look it up.<br>  <br>  A sociopath always has little troubles in life but they don't seem to be bothered by them as much as it bothers the people around them who try to fix everything.  Unfortunately therapy doesn't help since they manipulate the sessions.  Generally it tends to dissipate after 40.  Weird huh?  <br>  <br>  Educate yourself.  If you're dealing with a sociopath, be her friend but don't become co-dependant.  Nothing you do will really help.  Keep in mind it could be other things as well.  Is she eating and sleeping well?  Stuff like that.  Is it a desperate bid for attention?  (Not that that's a bad thing, it's a coping mechanism)<br>  <br>  Religion?  Well, the true religion has transformed murders, prostitutes, thieves, etc..because it follows God's standards rather than accepting all comers just to swell the ranks of the church and because it is blessed with God's spirit which is there for the asking when we need it.  Only Jehovah's Witnesses have the truth.  I encourage you to check out the website, check some of the answers on this site from us, or call a local Kingdom Hall and ask for a free home Bible study. <br>  <br>  But regarding your friend?  Figure out if this is medical first.  check out bipolar disorder too.  I appreciate your kind concern for her.  You have a good heart.|`|uUTmx9ZPaa	Religion is not the solution. He should instead find Christ. The reason is because all those who come to the Lord will not only be saved from their sins but they will be conformed to the image and stature of Christ (Rom 8:29). Every day they will be renewed since their spirit within them is constantly active to transform them (2 Cor 4:16). The spirit can do this only when the eternal life of God enters into their being (Jn 5:24), and metabolically transforms their soul. For some people it may take very long and for some it may take a short time to overcome lying. But eventually they all do with Christ. I know I did. :)|`|sBh8U18yaa	RELIGION IS THE MAIN ROLE HERE BUT THIS PERSON IS OPPRESSED BY THE DARKSIDE THATS WHERE THE "NONREMORSEFULLNESS" COMES FROM...THAT ANSWERS BOTH QUESTIONS, NOW FOR THE FINAL YOU ASKED "WHY"BECAUSE IT WAS PREORDAINED AND GOD KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN THIS WAY!!!!!|`|K8QTdUnfaa	In my experience, religion makes the lying worse.|`|RZetcwalaa	Read the story of ruth, deception is key to the birth of christ.|`|AQIhcBiuaa	If she is doing this by choice then there is not much that you can do.

bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I do not recall ever seeing a grown man cry because of physical pain. I have seen men cry or perhaps sob because of emotional pain. Men, I believe for some reason, loose their ability to cry like they did as a child. To show emotional pain is natural and I would be somewhat critical of any man that did not experience emotional pain and in someway express it. It is not uncommon for me to get emotional when in the privacy of my own home with my Sweetie. On occasion it is not strange for me to wipe a tear from my cheek when something truly impresses me even out in public. I sat on a curb stone along a path at Peggy's Cove near Halifax, Nova Scotia several years ago and listened to a lady play the bag pipes.  With the coast line behind her to add to this beautiful scene I realized that I was indeed seeing one of God's Gates to Heaven where people who perished in Flight 409 were received into his loving care. This was food for my soul and I will never forget that day. An experience such as this will indeed strengthen your faith.

The book Hitlers Pope - much maligned by the Vatican, identifies HItler as a godless individual who used Pacelli to further his own drive for power.<br>  <br>  After Hitler came to power in January 1933, he made concordat negotiations with Pacelli.  <br>  <br>  The Reich Concordat granted Pacelli the right to impose the new Code of Canon Law on Catholics in Germany. In exchange, Pacelli collaborated in the withdrawal of Catholics from political and social activity. The negotiations were conducted in secret by Pacelli, Kaas, and Hitler's deputy chancellor<br>  <br>  Hitler insisted that his signature on the concordat would depend on the Center Party's (Catholic political party) voting for the Enabling Act, which gave him dictatorial powers.  Next, Hitler insisted on the "voluntary" disbanding of the Center Party.

He was Catholic and believed he was doing G-d's work.  He barely tolerated Muslims being in the auxiliary Waffen SS in the Baltics and in the Middle East.  He needed their help in the Balkans to combat partisans and to round up Jews for extermination.  He needed them in the Middle East because he wanted the oil.<br>  <br>  Himmler and Hitler despised having them wear Nazi uniforms but tolerated it.  The Muslims Nazis were not allowed to wear the SS lightning runes.  The SS officers in charge of Muslim units wore fez hats with swastikas on the front. Rather comical to see those racists wearing fez hats except they were very serious in wiping out all Jews in the world - then they planned on starting in on other groups (I've a book with photos of the Muslim Nazi units)<br>  <br>  They thought Russians and Slavic ethnic groups were inferior to Germans and Austrians, what do you think they thought of Muslims?<br>  <br>  # # #<br>  <br>  Wonder why I got TD's for a factual answer.

That's been true from Ra to Zues to now. <br>  <br>  Since there is no rationale way to prove, or even field a good logical argument for the existence of any supernatural beings there is necessarily a limit to applying logic. Heck even the Vatican would not let the intelligent design or creationist folks come to their discussion of evolution with scientists.<br>  <br>  People who believe such things, and people have all through time, do so based on faith (and perhaps a host of social influences), not evidence, and are therefore illogical by definition.|`|AA11613911	yea, its kinda like asking al gore to stop being a whiny douche|`|zeFUwg6Zaa	you just fear what you dont understand...silly mortal|`|L8kPwdA9aa	lol i took an entire class on the logic of faith and specifically christianity.

But actually, most guys only like girls that are "dumber" than they are, simply because its easier for a guy to manipulate a dumb girl, and most guys fear girls that can manipulate them. <br>  Blond is more of a mannerism than anything, why it is associated with blonds...is much less relevant.<br>  Perhaps if the models in society that portray this mannerism had brunette hair (Paris Hilton, Brittney Spears) then the stereotype would be "Dumb Brunettes".|`|kk0UenaBaa	Yes|`|A6tkE0fAaa	No, not all blondes are dumb.

aac2aafaea3f3e84eae2f7b3c6f3a02eaa	My understanding of this sin is that it is a deliberate, settled willful rejection of the direct personal dealings of God in a person's life, where he knows it is God dealing with him, pleading, coaxing him to repentance; but he stubbornly refuses to listen and insists on pursuing his own way.<br>  There is no possible salvation for such a one, because they refuse to yield to the only influence and power in the Universe that can save them - the direct dealing of God through the Person of the Holy Spirit.<br>  I believe this first happened with Lucifer, who fell to become Satan; it happens with unbelievers when they hear the Gospel, they know in themselves it is true and that the Holy Spirit is drawing them, inviting them to be saved, but they steadfastly refuse; and it can happen with believers, who are being dealt with by the Holy Spirit; they know it is God dealing with them, to give up some sin, or to forgive someone; but they stubbornly refuse, and then a crisis arises where their faith is put on the line, and they don't have the strength to stand, because they stubbornly set themselves against God, His Word and His Holy Spirit.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

One who was "...possessed with a devil, blind and dumb (was brought to Jesus) and He healed him insomuch that the blind and the dumb both spake and saw" (verse 22). So Jesus freed one who was possessed by the power the Holy Spirit. Jesus did all of His work and His miracles through the power of the Holy Spirit. When this was done, the people began to say," ...Is not this the son of David" (verse 23)?" What did such a question mean? It meant that they were, because of the miracle, believing that Jesus was the Messiah!!!!<br>  <br>  This greatly disturbed the Pharisees. They had seen and heard enough of our Lord's teachings and miracles to be convinced also that he was indeed the Messiah. But they had adamantly rejected Him and were determined not to acknowledge Him as the Messiah. They were frightened by this suggestion of the multitude of people; so they blatantly and blasphemously declared, "...This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils" (verse 24). It is simple enough to see what they did in committing the blasphemy of (against) the Holy Spirit. THEY ATTRIBUTED THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE MINISTRY OF OUR LORD TO THE DEVIL. THAT IS THE BLASPHEMY OF (AGAINST) THE HOLY GHOST!!!! <br>  <br>  Having identified the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost, we come immediately to the question, "CAN THIS SIN BE COMMITTED TODAY?" There are teachers and preachers who answer, "Yes! And some will give illustrations of those who have committed it. I do not believe that it can be committed today. There are several reasons for this conclusion. In the first place, there is no record of it being committed any time after this in the New Testament. In fact, this is the only place in the Bible where we have a record of its being committed. Evidently, the Apostles, after the Saviour went back to Heaven, met and dealt with the committing of all other sins, but there is no record of them dealing with any who had committed this. Again we do not have an analogy of it. It is true that if God's servant stands, preaches, and does His bidding in the power of the Holy Spirit, and someone says that it is of the Devil, we have similar situation. But really, that is not an analogy because they attribute the work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ (not some mere preacher's) to the Devil.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is dying without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.<br>  <br>  The message of the Holy Spirit is that believing in Jesus alone is the only way to be forgiven of your sins and to be saved and to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  The person who dies without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation, is unforgiven and is therefore sent to hell for eternal torment. <br>  <br>  So believe in Jesus alone for salvation right now, and you will never be able to blaspheme the Holy Spirit  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

This truth shows us clearly and without question what is right and what is wrong.<br>  <br>  Evil is knowing what is right, and intentionally doing the opposite.<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit is the part of God that penetrates every fiber of the cosmos. It is an awareness. And yes, it is in all people, even people who might not know about religion at all.<br>  <br>  As a person goes through life, Spirit will remind them of what is right and what is wrong. For most people, they might listen some of the time, but not listen at other times. <br>  <br>  Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit happens when a person makes a free will choice to mute that still small voice. They decide that they alone will choose what they want to do - and it does not matter what "their conscious" tells them to do. In fact, they have decided to never again listen to that silent voice of Creator.<br>  <br>  When someone has done this, they have locked themselves out for good. They can never go back. Why? Because it is that internal Spirit that would have served as a thorn in the side for turning against good.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	Actually the meaning of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is not having to do with rejecting Christ entirely... it's not denouncing your faith as the popular youtube dare suggested lol.  <br>  <br>  It simply meant to attribute works of God to satan and visa versa.  Such as in Matt 12:22 when Jesus heals a man and casts out the evil demons.  The Pharisees see this and accuse Jesus of doing so by the power of satan.  Here is the scripture in context:<br>  <br>   22(A)Then a (B)demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.<br>  <br>   23All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "This man cannot be the (C)Son of David, can he?"<br>  <br>   24But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man (D)casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons."<br>  <br>   25(E)And (F)knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand.<br>  <br>   26"If (G)Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?<br>  <br>   27"If I (H)by Beelzebul cast out demons, (I)by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges.<br>  <br>   28"But (J)if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br>  <br>   29"Or how can anyone enter the strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.<br>  The Unpardonable Sin<br>   30"(K)He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters.<br>  <br>   31"(L)Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.<br>  <br>   32"(M)Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in (N)this age or in the age to come.<br>  <br>  <br>  So you see when we look at the scripture as it was written it is clear in what blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is which is more than saying your don't believe in God;)  <br>  <br>  Blessings :)|`|8f1aad60fdc5282467de23d30e778abeaa	Rejection of Jesus Christ

People do evil, not God|`|KaY8ivh1aa	He was a lonely abandoned child.|`|sohnrZDcaa	Do you pay attention to what the Bible says about Jesus and the slaughtering of children???<br>  <br>  According to the Bible writers, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! The Bible writers made it into a clear pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence outside of the Bible that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitler’s holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) When Jesus comes back he will personally slaughter ALL the CHILDREN of the wrong Church brand! He will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed believing that Jesus doesn’t do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam matches Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new religious “sins” like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the new President Obama honors most Christian and Catholic clergy dogmas damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) “I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD”* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they can’t beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children on his own to announce his expected return and at the same time to teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political “PRO-LIFE” stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus’ REVELATION…!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk!) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>  <br>  I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise when they find out that their children have been mysteriously slaughtered! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies! <br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to “dash the infants against the rocks” after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all! <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story… most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.<br>  <br>  I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT that is strongly believed in Christianity today!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. “Turning the other cheek” is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6)… The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in God’s Law “Be fruitful and multiply,” but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus’ gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the “Kingdom Sake.” See Wikipedia “castration”. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS! Please give me a break!|`|3crxFSNsaa	Ranting, are you?  <br>  <br>  I hope you feel better after your little tantrum.|`|AQIhcBiuaa	Not sure who you are talking about.

I think this is a matter of wisely being afraid of uncivilized hooligans who don't respect other people or their property.  It wouldn't matter if these individuals were caucasian, asian, hispanic, or black.  They are acting in an aggressive and threatening manner.  <br>  <br>  In your shoes you have a few options, but none may be easy to commit to do.  <br>  <br>  Option 1 is to avoid interaction and hope they don't unduely single you out for abuse.  This is the ostrich with their head in the sand approach, and may well not help you in the long run if they decide they want what you have.<br>  <br>  Option 2 is to anonymously call the police every time you witness them engaged in a crimal act like smoking pot or performing vandalism.  The problem is that the police are generally busy, and may not make responding to your complaints high priority.  This may also cause friction with your neighbors if they guess who is calling the police on them.<br>  <br>  Option 3 is to look into your options for relocating to another neighborhood where the citizens respect their neighbors as fellow human beings.  This is not necessarily a cheap option to exercise.

God cast him out of heaven, and he rules as Prince of Earth and King of Hell.  This was all part of God's plan.  Satan has no good in him, and is the root of evil.  God can not be sinful or evil in any way, since he is purely righteous.  The damned go to hell and after judgment day will be burned for iternity in the Lakes of Fire along with Satan, while the forgivien go to Heaven.  They do not 'make up' because, as much as it hurt God, it is not part of the Holy Plan.|`|F5pXHVo4aa	It seems that every believer I know is struggling with attacks from the devil. Some are having bigger struggles than others, but all are having struggles. Sometimes, those struggles are so severe, that it seems that there is no way for the believer to win.<br>  <br>  Have you ever, in the midst of one of those struggles, asked the Lord, "Why did you create the devil?" I know I have. It seems to me that life as a believer would be much easier if we didn't have to put up with constant attacks from the enemy.<br>  <br>  But, I have to tell you, God sees things a little bit differently. He isn't as concerned with our comfort as He is with our character. He isn't looking to see how "blessed" (with material blessings) we are, He's looking to see the condition of our heart. More than anything, God wants to see us grow and mature into the full stature of the image of Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, Satan is actually a provision of God's love for us. I know that sounds crazy, but it's true. Since God created everything, that means that he created Satan as well. If He created Satan, there must have been a purpose, the question is "why?"<br>  <br>  First of all, we need to truly understand that God created Satan. Isaiah, chapter 54, verse 16 says: "Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy." "The waster" mentioned in this verse is a name for the devil. God is telling us, through the prophet, that He created the devil. He's also told us that He created the weapons that the devil uses to attack us, when He mentions the smith (blacksmith). But, let's take a look at this verse in context:<br>  <br>      In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. 15 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. 16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. 17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.<br>  <br>      Is 54:14-17 <br>  <br>  God starts out in this passage by talking about establishing righteousness. Then, He goes on to talk about enemies, weapons, attacks, and victory. After that, in what is probably one of the most commonly used verses about spiritual warfare, he tells us that those weapons and enemies shall not prosper against us. In other words, He's telling us that His creation of the enemy, and His allowing of those weapons to be formed against us must have a purpose; a purpose for our benefit. Finally, He goes back to talking about righteousness. So, that purpose has something to do with establishing righteousness within us.<br>  <br>  Destruction is a natural part of growth. If we look at the life cycle of a forest, we see destruction as a part of that cycle. When fire comes, whether it is started by man, or by lightning, it causes new growth. The old trees die off, and new trees, of different types, grow up. In fact, certain types of pinecones (which are seeds of pine trees) need fire in order to open. If the fire of destruction didn't come, they would never bring forth new life.<br>  <br>  God created Satan because He knew that if we didn't have an enemy to fight against, we'd never grow and mature; we'd only stagnate and remain spiritual babies. Since God wanted us to grow, He needed to provide us with an enemy we'd have to struggle against.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way; if someone wants to have strong muscles, they need to exercise, so that the muscles can grow and become strong. Likewise, if someone wants to be a great warrior, they need to practice using the weapons of their warfare. Or, if they want their mind to grow, they have to study, think, and work, so that their ability to use their mind increases. It's the same with the spirit. If we want our spirits to grow strong and mature, we need to work and fight so that they can grow.<br>  <br>  Just as the best gold is purified in the crucible of the fire, and the strongest steel is tempered in the fire, the greatest believers are forged in the fire of affliction. If Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego hadn't passed through the fire of affliction, we would not know of them. Their greatness came about through their ability to rise above the attacks of the enemy, and through their faith, triumph in what appeared to be impossible circumstances.<br>  <br>  When we are faced with impossible circumstances, we too need to rise above them. Instead of allowing them to become stumbling blocks, we need to use them as stepping stones, to climb higher. It may very well be a struggle to do that, but it is those struggles which will help us grow into|`|2BPh14qAaa	Yeah.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	You know, those Twilight books really caused a lot of psychological problems in people who can't tell reality from fiction.|`|rhTCejrtaa	you are not a vampire, they are not real<br>  cravings for blood can be real, but as for undead people, no. all it is you have is a fantasized idea because you are unhappy with yourself.|`|WJGsHFRAaa	I don't really believe in vampires but no one knows for sure.

06NbP7Ihaa	I usually gather everything up and bunch it in the front. It can be a bit cumbersome but I've managed to keep everything but my bottom from touching the toilet (and preferably that has a disposable seat cover on it).

Very few are clean enough, even if the look okay, to worry about having your pleats sliding around. If you wear a wool kilt, it's almost impossible to hold all that fabric. Take it off-off, don't step though by hoping out of the kilt, as the bottom of your kilt might sweep the floor pretty good.<br>  <br>  If you are at your own house, you might try to hold the pleats, but I still find that it's easier to take the kilt off. It's sometimes easier to hop out, unless you are wearing it formally, where you would want to make sure it all goes back on really sharp.<br>  <br>  At least for the trouble of using the bathroom sitting down, at least the kilt makes up for just taking a whiz in the urinal. The nice thing there in a public bathroom is that a wool kilt will wrap around you real good, even if you pick up the aprons--so no loss of privacy or difficulty in using the bathroom.|`|6DGmbILkaa	I pull it up behind me as far as I can...it's very tricky but can be done

WseLyvSpaa	It is related to what you've said, but more basic.  "Manners" refers to the norms of good or acceptable social behavior in a civilized society.|`|rThIVk2maa	"Manners are the unenforced standards of conduct which show the people to be cultured, polite, and refined. They are like laws in that they codify or set a standard for human behavior, but they are unlike laws in that there is no formal system for punishing transgressions, other than social disapproval."<br>  <br>  Mainly it's just being kind to others, common courtesy and having the wisdom to know when to be honest and when to be kind or even when to just be vague or blow people off who you don't like.<br>  <br>  Manners must be learned from parents, otherwise kids learn them from each other, which is often socially disastrous.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	manners need to be ta taught to every body starting at a very young age and we all know what manners are with out this certain etiquette it shows just how ignorant a human being can get and be it is a part of every thing in a life that tries to be accomplished job loved ones etc; manners id a part or should be a part of every day life as teeth brushing  you know the old saying manners go a long way>|`|irsxgCZyaa	Manners is following social ettiquette which includes being polite (please and thank you) as well as "helping" (opening doors etc). <br>  <br>  I think it's up to the parents to teach their children proper manners.
a6JZjRG1aa	learn Chinese... they are friendlier to foreigners...<br>  <br>  these two cultures are very different...<br>  <br>  for example, in ancient Japan suicide was very common and actually noble death... that is "good death"... however, how can death be better than life and viewed as something wonderful?<br>  <br>  another example, in Japan a samurai had the right ti kill a commoner just to test his sword... here comes a question, is a sword worth a human life?... pretty silly i would say...<br>  <br>  another example, in China things were usually valued in silver, while in Japan it was rice... why so?... because Japanese settlers were locked on their islands and consumed the seafood mostly... half-hungry nation... even now, only one apple or only one pear is viewed as a pretty good gift... just one... that's not "high grace", that's "misery"...<br>  <br>  another example, ninjas... they are not "cool and skilled warriors", actually they were killers who hit in the back, and were looked down upon... and social classes, like those who dealt with dead or skinned the animals... it's wrong to think some people are "cleaner" than others...<br>  <br>  another example, modern world, hi-tech civilization... have you seen "Royal Battle"?... what does that movie teach?... blood, violence, death for young... is this "the better world"?... as for me, communistic marching and patriotic songs are safer and calmer than movies like "the ring" and the mentioned above...<br>  <br>  i chose China, what you choose only depends on your personality...|`|b3TljD0Laa	Well, I'm only Japanese so I can only give you a one sided opinion, but I believe that both countries will be impressed to see an American speaking their language. Seeing an Asian speaking English may not be as surprising since the language has been so universalized, but a Japanese-speaking American, especially with no accent, still continues to amaze me.<br>  <br>  And as long you're not fat or bald, then you'll be good in Japan. haha Especially if you're tall--that's a big plus. And try to be as American-looking as you can. I guess the gap between the cultures attracts girls?<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|WUUXLvdnaa	japan is pro american. china is more aligned with russia. japan has been capitalist much longer, whereas china is just begining to. japanese culture comes from china, but has changed into a thing of its own over the years. japanese women are more open to white men, but chinese women are open to foreigners too. there is more to do in china because its more diverse. its like the u.s. its a big country with each part being very distinct. japan is more uniformed. japan is more expensive, so you wont get to do as much as you would in china.|`|AA10155323	Japanese is more of open minded as to Chinese.Chinese culture still<br>  are many old fashion.

d771ac26c54693f162bb53c76472def4aa	Sounds like you are wanting someone to say that it was Divine intervention that saved you. Who can say? We see and believe what we want, sometimes just for comfort and closure on things we either cannot explain or to make circumstances more dramatic than they may have been.  I think we do this because I think that many people<br>  deep down want to believe in the extraordinary or God and these types of events are miniature springboards that help propel us toward that goal. So was it coincidence or God? It can be argued that when entering a cemetary one will invariably think of his or her own demise, sometimes even going so far as to picture their own funeral, noting every detail-who was there, who was crying and so forth. So maybe that's all that happened to you. Or maybe you did experience God saving your butt. Stranger things have happened. So if it comforts you at all to believe God saved you then so be it. If you don't believe in that sort of thing then you are one lucky person who needs to watch what the hell he's doing.|`|uQHHVI8Zaa	God decided it wasn't your time to go then.<br>  <br>  God was the one who had His Hand under you so you wouldn't fall that one more inch.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	You are lucky.

Trust in Him with all your heart.  Read the Bible and pray every day.  God loves you.  Search for Him and you will find Him.<br>  <br>  Read the book of John and the New Testament (but not Rev---to hard for you to understand).  So read what you need to be reading.  Read the book of Proverbs and one chapter in Psalms.  Be sure to read what Jesus said and God bless you!!!  Be careful.  You life is important.|`|cNniG2L0aa	I got to be 62 cos I'm lucky.<br>  <br>  Life's Journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting, "Holy sh?t ....

54be3c7eda2a6643c24f8ad882a635d7aa	Some guys are really oblivious. You have to tell them what a big deal it is to you so they will know that it IS a big deal. My guess is that you guys are both still young and he probably hasn't had too many relationships to learn how sensitive girls really are about these things. <br>  I would give him one more chance, but after that I would surely look for someone new. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|zviDShi6aa	You aren't making too big of a deal.  I've been in this exact situation.<br>  He may not have realised how excited you were but now that you've made it clear, he should know better. If he does the same thing one more time, I would leave him. I know that sounds harsh, but if you tell someone how important something is to you and they still can't be bothered, who's to say they won't always be like that? You went out of your way to make him feel special and you deserve the same in return. <br>  <br>  People always say, oh, it's just how guys are. Why is that a decent excuse? What makes it ok for them to go around hurting our feelings when they know better? Nothing. It's just making it easier for us to feel guilty for being hurt. Don't feel bad for being hurt. On the other hand, it may have just been an honest mistake or a one time thing, so don't be too angry at him.<br>  <br>  It may also be that he isn't sure exactly HOW to make you feel special. Maybe (nicely) suggest some stuff if the topic comes up again. Try not to be angry or really emotional about it, just say, this is the sort of stuff I like. Make a list if you want; I know this genuinely helps lots of guys cause they don't always know how to buy gifts.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad that you feel bad. It isn't stupid. It's important to you so it should be important to him. <3|`|n336SjRiaa	guys sometimes are really REALLY stupid. you should just cool it w/ him. be neutral w/ him. no boyfriend, but no dumping him. just become non-caring. bcuz he doesnt care about you as much as you care about him, so let him go.|`|bH6KUo3jaa	WOW! u should DUMP HIM!!! for revenge! and laugh at his face until he crys, and walk away|`|PhPD7uAFaa	No you have a right to be upset. Men are not very sentimental and sometimes can be very cheap. Even though you felt a simple card would do he probably thought different. thats why he sort of avoided you. But you dropped the ball when you cried. Besides valentines how often does he give expressions of love our take you out? If he's a great guy the other 363 days of the year than don't make such a big stink. Just next time let him know a day before val. day how much you excited to share your love val. day with him. But if he always oh so busy and doesn't have time for you than chances he's probably not that in to you.|`|zKEgGwhxaa	Yeah, that sucks.  Some guys just aren't into it.  My husband of 4 years hasn't even gotten me a card the last 3 years.  He did stuff while we were dating, and we dated for 3 years before getting married.  I have talked to him about it and told him how much it hurts my feelings, and he just gets mad and says it is a Hallmark holiday that someone made up just to make money.  He says that he loves me every day of the year and doesn't need to squeeze it all into one day.  So I guess some guys just don't care, it's not that they're being jerks, they're just not into it.|`|ca3cde249db0aeb29f6850a36707a1deaa	Um great story, (:....but you are not making a big deal out of it it's just how you feel b/c you can't help it...just make sure next time around he can tend to your needs...ok...but I don't think he meant it....Ask him about his grade or something...seems like a smart boy, he seemed busy. he's jsut trying to make it to college you know...but it should be up to you whether you can deal with what he has in his life...ok...I really hope you get my full understanding...thanks,,happy belated V-day

I'd rather be nice and compact to save space.|`|nhGIZE71aa	Cremated.  Hindus are cremated rather than buried.  I have been told that if someone is cremated it is easier for their relatives to move on than if they are buried, as they tend to start being concerned about how the dead body is doing in the ground, and whether it is uncomfortable and such.  Of course it is difficult even for the relatives of someone who is cremated, but cremation is symbolic of the destruction of a form after its usefulness has been exhausted, and therefore can help to sever a person's mental attachments to that body.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Cremated.  It's better for the environment.|`|WjRqYf6naa	It won't matter to me.

Also, I believe it's disgusting to have someone lick the dirt off the soles of my feet. In fact, I don't even let my soles get dirty. Although, whenever I'm having sex or participating in foreplay, sure enough, I don't mind a guy doing what he wants with my feet, but like I said, making a guy my slave is a turn-off. During sex, I'm WAY too submissive to have a slave. See, my foot fetish causes me to get in the mood quicker when the foreplay pertains to my feet, (other places too, don't get me wrong) and that's it.

Find a girl who LOVES you. Love automatically brings great sex without that crap.|`|7aMk2Vd5aa	No that's a lil strange... Get help 4 her.|`|cdaae96Yaa	No that is crazy and stupid.  I would never make a girl do that.
gpXPQuN3aa	Lol I know the feeling! I SWEAR my upstairs neighbors ALWAYS take a shower about 2 minutes after I start running mine. I can hear their water start running and they adjust it constantly, so my water goes from boiling to icy and back again!<br>  <br>  Likely it's just a coincidence, but it sure can feel like they're doing it on purpose!|`|GHd84xipaa	i can't see how she would know which room you are in if she lives up stairs.i can understand if you lived above her,but how can she tell what room you are in.something doesn't sound right.what you should do is cut your TV on in the living room and that way she will think you are in there the whole you are in the bedroom.good luck.

You might like both. At some point you will decide. Really there is no reason to rush this. You are around the age that most people start to be aware of what they want in life.

Have fun and good luck.|`|cyCBalgyaa	No your not to young, but maybe your body chemistry is just a bit mixed up right now.

8tqgOoE9aa	wtf. Go for it. I can't believe I just said that, but you're not blood related, so there really isn't any danger of spawning wierd kids. It's just a social taboo. A few decades ago, your cousin would be a good candidate, bc your family knew him. Social stigmas change, and are at best created to help people fit in. Just do what you want, say F the rest.|`|qlY4VO8caa	its awkward. but you arnt related its your step father. your legally related.<br>  <br>  do you want, but you shouldn't feel obligated just b/c its your anniversary.<br>  <br>  you could wait and get a lil farther then a 3 min kiss. it seems like a big step.|`|AA10538251	reverse the situation, how would you feel about being pressured.

You're not related. You're not blood. If this is your stepfather's half-brother, they are only half blood. And your stepfather is not really related to you. I think that's so good of you to be going out for so long and haven't had any sexual relations. Most people will rush into it. Talk to him about it. And don't pressure him. If he still doesn't feel right wait it out. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|g71m3S9Naa	You know some people would think that is way to wierd.  The fact of the matter is there is no blood realation between you two.  It is not the same as being in love with your brother which is your uncle, you know something like a hillbilly kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Anyway go for it.|`|959YXUWYaa	He's your stepfather's half-brother.  You aren't blood relatives; in fact, you're barely related.  He's your half-step-uncle.  And he's only 8 years older than you.<br>  <br>  It isn't nasty at all.  Stop thinking like that.|`|HflkFlkpaa	If it is your step father, and he is his half brother, than NO you are in no way related. If you want you can go for it.|`|28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	Your not related, but it is a weird setup.

But I can't tell if my attraction to women is the same as a straight man's attraction to women or if its more like a straight woman's attraction to men.<br>  <br>  I suspect it isn't exactly the same as either one.  I would imagine that my needs -- emotionally, psychologically, physically, etc -- aren't that much different from other (straight) women. OTOH, what I'm attracted to in a woman is in some ways different from straight women find attractive in a man -- but that doesn't mean its necessarily the same as what straight men find attractive in women either.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Yes. It works in exactly the same way. And if you ask str8 people why they like what they like (like blonde hair or an ample behind), they will probably tell you "I don't know. I just do." Ask gay people the same question and they'll tell you the same thing.<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure there is such a grand difference between how str8 men are attracted to women and how str8 women are attracted to men.<br>  <br>  I CAN tell you that gay men are NOT attracted to other men because they view them as "female." They are attracted to the masculinity regardless of whether the man is a top or a bottom, though those little details will ultimately come into play once it comes down to the mechanics of sex.|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	From what I remember in my social psych class, and what i have experienced as a lesbian, even gay couples play a specific role in the relationship. For example, I prefer to work outside of my home, and hopefully my mate will prefer to stay home, and if not, that's fine too. But I plan to make enough money to support a family. I feel best when i am the provider, and there are hopefully lesbians out there that are looking for stability and will be attracted to me partly because of that.|`|CDft5bscaa	no, gaiety, lesbianism, male, and female heterosexuality each have their own mindset|`|XE527cDpaa	depends<br>  are you a pitcher or a catcher?|`|cbY6NoHSaa	I sure it is we fall in love with the person not the label or their parts.

6q2Uyb1Baa	Real vampires are very different from what most people think of when they think of vampires.  We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.  <br>  www.sanguinarius.org<br>  www.slad.net<br>  www.vampirecommunity.com|`|AA12148328	I heard that garlic will repel vampires , but since the don't really exist then why bother . Yes there are those who practice the vampire life , weird but so true . But they don't change into bats , at least I hope they don't anyway . Also you have to invite a vampire into you home if you don't they can't come in .

With siblings it can be difficult to get them to disclose things - especially if you have made him feel like you wish he wouldn't do all of the things that he's doing.<br>  <br>  If you really want to know, the best way to go about it is to let him know that you're not going to judge him (for anything), that you love him and that he can trust you. Let him know that by not condemning his lifestyle or saying judgmental things. Chances are pretty good that he knows that skipping school and doing drugs is bad already and he's probably got a bit of self-guilt going on.<br>  <br>  But anyway, just be there for him a bit and then either ask him or wait for him to tell you. The best thing you can do for your brother is be there for him. It will be much better if he tells you himself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11620807	SEEMING straight doesn't mean he is.   I'm a straight inclined bisexual man, but NOBODY would guess it about me. (some people i've told outright refused to believe me.)<br>  <br>  <br>    Does your bro know you're worried about his behavior too?  If not, you should tell him so. Either way, my advice would be to talk to him directly and openly about your concern. He'll have to be the one to decide what and how much to talk about, but you can help lead ease him into openly talking by insisting that you'd be ok with and still love him no matter what's going on.  Try a blunt hint like "If this is all cause you're gay or bi and trying to deal with it, you'd be agonizing for no reason, cuz I'd be fine with it if you ARE gay." <br>  <br>       If the hint suggestion isnt right, try talking with him and steering the topic to sexuality. The context would be neutral, and would let ya make it known that you're respectful and comfortable with 'alternative lifestyles' .  This would also avoid discomfort if the underlying problem he's got is something OTHER than being gay. -s it possible he's got a girl pregnant? No matter the truth, is best to walk softly but be there for yer bro.|`|ZunJKYVDaa	maybe hes gay or maybe he lost his virginity or something idk i would go talk to him and find out if he wants you to know he  might be more comfortable talking to you(or less) in which case you could ask him if he wants your mom to tell you or not|`|ZLQ6X0oOaa	gay gay gay<br>  <br>  And before anyone starts no i dont have a single problem at all with someone who is gay, each to there own, ok :)|`|HWnsRx35aa	maybe he is, maybe he isn't - would it change how you feel about him?|`|v2ut95Wzaa	I don't think so, but don't worry about it...|`|AA10036948	to me he sounds depressed.may be something going on back of his mind.i wouldn''t think at first place because he is gay..thinking like that is stpuid and silly.|`|R9fsNpYPaa	Is gay a bad thing?

rv2Iy1Y7aa	My dictionary gives four entries for the word "crave" (efflagitare, appetere, concupiscere and desiderare).  These are the present, active infinitives of course.  You would have to determine the correct form according to your need.  There are many ways to use the word "craving" in English and at least as many ways in Latin. (I am craving, you are craving, etc. ... or even "Craving a large chocolate shake, she ... etc.).<br>  <br>  Of the four choices in my dictionary, I would use a form of the verb "concupiscere" as a matter of personal choice; but any of these would suffice.  You could even choose a Latin verb for "begging".|`|epXVyzLkaa	CRAVUS IN LATINNUS..|`|Pe0gITtiaa	oooooo latin cravings.

Maybe you can try to find someone that is like minded to befriend him, perhaps even organize a neighborhood social event so that he makes friends with the other neighbors, does he have a job? Perhaps you can find a way to focus that enthusiasm by suggesting volunteer work, or setting up a community watch and place him in charge, all in all if you do anything to try to blow him off no matter how nice you try to make it, it could back fire on you. Try to see if you can find a way to occupy his time. Good Luck|`|47FsMLlwaa	Work in the garage or back yard. Stop feigning interest in his conversation. Be civil but not accommodating. Don't hesitate to NOT answer the door every time he comes over. When you are outside, put in earphones and listen to music. Tell him you don't have time to talk right now. Don't make eye contact. If this fails, talk about something that will turn him off--your granddaughter's dog's poo problem, whatever. Describe in detail.|`|OuQizrQ6aa	I've known people like this. It is very difficult to deal with because no one wants to be mean to someone who is well-intentioned. <br>  <br>  It sounds like he clings to you because you provide him validation for his insecurities. If, instead of humoring him, you very subtly make him feel insecure he may come by less and less. <br>  <br>  The most effective method I've ever used to deal with clingy people like this is to blow a minor transgression out of proportion and make the person think that I'm very angry with them. That gives me a go-to excuse to ask them to leave whenever they try to make contact with me. It's underhanded, but will hurt a person less than telling them that they're annoying, overbearing and that their friendship is not wanted.|`|U4rbyiyqaa	I would get straight to the point with him.My wife and I would like to spend some time alone.In actuality you don't even need to explain yourself.If you want to then you guys are having a personal conversation or are working on something together and would appreciate some time alone so you guys can concentrate on your projects.simple and straight to the point without being mean.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	Maybe find a way to make it unpleasant for him to come over.

Tell him NOT to come over unless he is invited. Don't think of it as being mean to him, HE is the one who is being rude!

Possibly ask him if he wants to volunteer his time to help with the work, and give him something to do.  From your description it sounds as if he might be slightly delayed, and so has not learned good social skills.  He may not know any other way to be friendly.  Find out about groups in your area who may need volunteers, or who may work with individuals who have problems, and find a way to bring up the subject with him, encouraging him to use the skills he does have to help others.  And practice ways to bring conversations with him to a close "Thanks for dropping by, John.  Nice to talk to you.  See you tomorrow."  Does he live alone or with family?  Could you talk to a family member about the situation?|`|JwnHKTabaa	tell him you want time alone with your husband, or you're doing something.|`|WseLyvSpaa	Next time he comes over unannounced, simply don't say hello or speak to him. If that doesn't work, go inside and shut the door nonchalantly, as though you didn't notice him.  If THAT doesn't work, tell him openly that you would prefer he call first and only once every two weeks, to arrange for a possible visit. The alternative is to give him more work to do...for free.<br>  <br>  Depending on how insensitive he is at your suggestions and how desperately he needs you companionship, it might take him a while to get the message.  But one word of advice:  Unless he is your sworn enemy, don't shut him out completely.  None of us is so special we can afford to lose a friend totally, and I don't even believe in karma.|`|rThIVk2maa	Urgh... well, it's kind of like feeding cats, once you start they're quite hard to get rid of. This guy needs fed attention. Perhaps saying stuff like "Thanks Bob, I appreciate your suggestions. Now, if you don't mind, I really do have to focus on this. It was really nice to see you though! I'll talk to you later"<br>  <br>  Little things that kind of end a conversation are what you need to inject in your chats with him. To be neighborly is lovely, but try to derail him any time he begins to annoy. Ask him how his family  is, get him to talk about SOMETHING else other than what you're doing, or simply add in those little phrases that say "goodbye" kindly and with a smile.

xF8TvlhYaa	Your question itself is a leading question, with preconceived notion.<br>  <br>  In the west there is a class system. I am told people marry only among their class etc.,Why no one is making an accusing finger towards class system practiced by the whites.<br>  <br>  The caste system in India, in its original form of strict stratification according to your work and conduct in society had already not in vogue.Previously some jobs were the exclusive monopoly of certain caste only. His son,grand son, great grandson--all have to do the same job in chain. Now that has gone. Now any caste people can do any job.Now the so called upper<br>  caste,dominant class(?)- people are even pulling rickshaws,work as construction worker etc.,Their exclusive preserve of learning and teaching are not prevalent now. Any one can takeup teaching now.<br>  <br>  In marriages caste is still a deciding factor. Even if an educated girl choose her partner and have dating as in western style, she tries to select the same caste lad.The purity of blood is still ruling the roost and inter caste marriage is still a distant dream.This can be compared with western culture of white marry only white of the same class.Black marry only  black. Inter class/colour marriages are not appreciated.<br>  <br>  The Government of India is extending caste based concessions to the castes which were supposed to be suppressed for centuries in education and employment.They have to mention their caste in schools, colleges,and in work place to avail the benefits. There is no time limit to end this system of doling out concessions and no attempt to exclude those of the so called depressed class who have made it to the top alrady. One depressed class person was President of India for 5 years. His family is also eligible for concessions irrespective of the fact that he was elevated to the highest post in the country. No political party will try to stop this;if they try they will loose popularity and loose votes.As long as the concession continue caste will  officially continue. There is no scope of ending concessions right now;no one talks about it.<br>  <br>  Caste is not that bad as you presume. It served well in administration prior to British rule.Caste gave job security, simple justice when in dispute, decentralised administration and distribution. The work done by a family was easily<br>  learnt by the next generation.Expertise was developed by repetitive action. They became expert professionals.<br>  <br>  British who ruled the world,adopted divide and rule policy. So they took this caste divisions prevalent in india,misinterpreted it, set one caste against the other,and established their hegamony<br>  here in India. Their mischief of dividing by caste, religion, language race are still haunting India.<br>  Vote bank politics is perpetuating the division and discriminations.|`|5b6e62fbefdc1d5cc61a98468c918dd5aa	Now the whole of India believes in castes , thanks to the political parties which want to do away with castes !

IT IS NOT GODS NAME. It is not a hebrew translation. It is not a hebrew pronunciation. The 4 consonants are purposely not pronouncable as Judaism believes that to give God a name is to give him a human quality in order to better concieve of him, but it is inherently misleading. <br>  <br>  There never has been or will be a Jew that has prayed to Yahweh.

After the Exile (6th century bc), and especially from the 3rd century bc on, Jews ceased to use the name Yahweh for two reasons. As Judaism became a universal religion through its proselytizing in the Greco-Roman world, the more common noun Elohim, meaning “god,” tended to replace Yahweh to demonstrate the universal sovereignty of Israel’s God over all others. <br>  At the same time, the divine name was increasingly regarded as too sacred to be uttered; it was thus replaced vocally in the synagogue ritual by the Hebrew word Adonai (“My Lord”), which was translated as Kyrios (“Lord”) in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

In the ancient world, knowing another's name was a special privilege that offered access to that person's thought and life. God favored His people by revealing Himself by several names which offered special insight into His love and righteousness.<br>   Jehovah Yahweh. One of the most important names for God in the Old Testament is Yahweh, or Jehovah, from the verb "to be," meaning simply but profoundly, "I am who I am," and "I will be who I will be." The four-letter Hebrew word YHWH was the name by which God revealed Himself to Moses in the burning bush <Ex. 3:14>. This bush was a vivid symbol of the inexhaustible dynamism of God who burns like a fire with love and righteousness, yet remains the same and never diminishes. Some English translations of the Bible translate the word as Jehovah, while others use Yahweh.<br>   God is the author of life and salvation. His "I am" expresses the fact that He is the infinite and original personal God who is behind everything and to whom everything must finally be traced. This name, "I am who I am," signals the truth that nothing else defines who God is but God Himself. What He says and does is who He is. The inspired Scriptures are the infallible guide to understanding who God is by what He says about Himself and what He does. Yahweh is the all-powerful and sovereign God who alone defines Himself and establishes truth for His creatures and works for their salvation.<br>   Moses was called to proclaim deliverance to the people and was told by God, "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you' "<Ex. 3:14>. In the deliverance of the Hebrew people from slavery in Egypt, God revealed a deeper significance to His name. But He had already disclosed Himself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as Yahweh. Each of them had called on the name of the Lord (Yahweh) <Gen. 12:8; 13:4; 26:25; Ex. 3:15> as the God who protects and blesses. Yet <Exodus 6:3> shows that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know the fuller meaning of Yahweh, which was to be revealed to Moses and the Hebrew people in the Exodus experience.<br>   The divine name Yahweh is usually translated Lord in English versions of the Bible, because it became a practice in late Old Testament Judaism not to pronounce the sacred name YHWH, but to say instead "my Lord" (Adonai)-- a practice still used today in the synagogue. When the vowels of Adonai were attached to the consonants YHWH in the medieval period, the word Jehovah resulted. Today, many Christians use the word Yahweh, the more original pronunciation, not hesitating to name the divine name since Jesus taught believers to speak in a familiar way to God.|`|8I9uduIiaa	No, this was never the name for G-d. In fact, it is a mistranslation of the Jewish 'tetragrammatron', YHVH. Hebrew has no vowels, so we don't know precisely how this would have been pronounced and anyway, Jews never said this name aloud; it was only spoken once a year, by the high priest, on Yom Kippur.<br>  <br>  Early Christian theologians added vowels, and ended up - wrongly - with 'yahweh' and 'jehovah'. Jews never use either.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com</a>|`|fa69e0b2d073786cb9c8d9e0436625a2aa	"Yahweh" is God personal name. In today's Bibles, Yahweh is changed to the capitalized word "LORD." I'm not really sure why.|`|s5XNGbOMaa	The Jewish people gave God many names, depending on his actions. However, I'm not sure what Yahweh means.

No religion has ever been objectively 'confirmed', because so many of them operate on faith.<br>  <br>  What's you're essentially saying here is, "We don't know everything, so the things we don't know must have come from God."  The problem is, our knowledge base is a work in progress.  You're essentially taking the blank sheet of the unknown and writing 'GOD' across it.  It has no advantages over any other approach - less actually, as it's just assuming everything we don't currently know cannot be known.  Science and philosophy can both at least show us new things.<br>  <br>  Now if you want to do that, hey, that's your business and nobody else's.  I have no issues with someone believing that god created us through evolution.  But it's not science.

uK4hyhe3aa	WOW!  "adam and eve to ******* and arabs", get a life buddy.<br>  <br>  Last names, or family names indicate the family to which a person belongs and each culture has it's own rules as to how these names are applied and used.<br>  <br>  Surnames have arisen in cultures with large, concentrated populations where single names for individuals became insufficient to identify them clearly. In many cultures, the practice of using additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals has arisen. These identifying terms or descriptors may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation. Often these descriptors developed into fixed clan identifications which became family names in the sense that we know them today.<br>  <br>  During the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted the practice of using family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the imperialistic age of European expansion and particularly from the 17th to 19th centuries onward. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Tibetans, Burmese, and Javanese do not use family names.|`|46fouwFfaa	The giving of last names varies in different cultures. Centuries ago in France, last names were usually the name of the village or town that the person's family is from.

I remember reading an SF novel in which everyone was born with a three-quarter credit, when they got married they had one and a half credits. They could sell the half credit or buy out the other half, or make their marriage (Household, really) bigger by adding additional members, who would often live close to each other and share child-rearing duties.<br>  <br>  To maintain population each couple must have no more than 2 children - one to replace each parent. Now if we could figure out how to maintain a breeding population while feeding the aged population we'll be on to something.<br>  <br>  Make it hard! Make it rife with stress tests and examinations! Mandatory reversible vasectomies for boys! Yes, they come in reversible - since I first heard of the tech a decade ago it's probably even better and cheaper to do now.

AA11946005	I think she just doesn't have a sense of humor when it comes to herself.  You were implying, jokingly, that she's a whirlwind while poking thru your supplies, so you made it about her, which is personal (even tho you meant it in a lighthearded way, she did indeed get your point, which is you don't like what she does).|`|xnsU60hhaa	I think she was incredibly rude going through your stuff. Yes, technically it is owned by the company, but when it is in our offices, we are responsible for it. It is just common courtesy to ask people for things instead of rummaging through them in offices. Also, some of us do keep personal items at work, and so we don't want other people going through our drawers and cabinets. It looks like you did an adequate job of pointing out her lack of courtesy. You got your point across.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	Well, she may have been embarrassed and left, but I think it may have worked for you!

However, when you say something like "Hey, do I go into your office and start rooting through all your stuff" with a smile on your face, it might sound like you're not joking at all.

The truth will out. <br>  <br>  Gross National Happiness: Why Happiness Matters for America--and How We Can Get More of It  <br>  by Arthur C. Brooks<br>  <br>  "He finds that there is a real "happiness gap" in America today, and it lies disconcertingly close to America's cultural and political fault lines. The great divide between the happy and the unhappy in America, Brooks shows, is largely due to differences in social and cultural values. The values that bring happiness are faith, charity, hard work, optimism, and individual liberty. Secularism, excessive reliance on the state to solve problems, and an addiction to security all promote unhappiness."|`|4ca7cbc3cf438ff2c043a82b2b46730caa	I can't stand evangelical Christians and they are the ones growing in population whereas the non-cult religious people are getting less and less concerned about the whole thing.

You can't even trust the schools with informing you that your own child is pregnant and that they are going to take her to have an abortion. Pro choice or pro life, you at least deserve to know. Twenty years ago, you would know. Twenty years ago even the main stream denominations all believed in the same thing without being perverted into swaying to the seducing of spirits. Twenty years ago the world respected America. Twenty years ago, the Ten commandments were still on the courthouse wall influencing people.

RkjKDh6yaa	How can it be a fad when it's not a choice? What's a "fad" is experimenting with your sexuality.

Nowadays, it's more socially acceptable (though not that much more) to explore those "other urges". <br>  <br>  It may also be a fad to act gay, though I haven't personally seen that. For the most part, acting gay is viewed as a bad thing. For guys, at least.<br>  <br>  But to actually be gay is not a fad.

Some people just take the most widely known "taboo" and claim it as their own by their actions. <br>  <br>  When I was in high school, claiming to cut oneself and self-diagnoses of depression were common. I've known quite a few people who would put Band-Aids on their wrists and try to "hide" their cuts because boyfriend/girlfriend # whatever ended the relationship. Not only did it annoy the rest of us, it made it more difficult for friends and teachers to reach out to those who actually had something going on.<br>  <br>  In this case, today's society is different from years before and some feel more confident in coming out, which may seem like it's becoming a fad, and some others are "rebelling," which isn't fair to those who do have difficulty coming out.|`|vL8JErXNaa	Oh yeah of course it's a fad, sure, uh huh just like blue eyes are a fad and handedness is a fad and my personal fave, attached earlobes.

I knew a girl once who said she was bisexual (and I have two friends who actually are bisexual), and it came out later that she was just trying to fit in.

It's because no guy would ever forfeit his masculinity to get girls' attention, mainly because most girls aren't into that sort of thing. Then there're the girls. There are a suprising number of whores who're actually just doing it for the attention, and I don't know a single straight man who isn't into that.<br>  Then again, there are some people who take it to the extreme and say they're gay.

In all cases the New World Translation uses “Sheol” for the Hebrew word she’ohl′. The Greek Septuagint generally renders she’ohl′ as hai′des.<br>  The derivation of the Hebrew word she’ohl′ is uncertain. According to one derivation, it means the “place of inquiry”; according to another, the “hollow place” or “resting-place”; according to still another, “the place that asks for and demands all without distinction of persons.” It is in the earth and is always associated with the dead, and plainly means the common grave of mankind, gravedom, or the earthly (not sea) region of the dead. In contrast, the Hebrew word qe′ver means an individual grave or burial place.—Ge 23:4, 6, 9, 20.<br>  The Ten Occurrences of Hades<br>  “Hades,” perhaps meaning “the unseen place,” occurs ten times in the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, namely, in Mt 11:23; 16:18; Lu 10:15; 16:23; Ac 2:27, 31; Re 1:18; 6:8; 20:13, 14.<br>  In Ac 2:27, Peter’s quotation of Ps 16:10 shows Hades is the equivalent of Sheol and is applied to the common grave of mankind (in contrast with the Greek word ta′phos, an individual grave). The Latin word corresponding to Hades is in·fer′nus (sometimes in′fe·rus). It means “that which lies beneath; the lower region,” and well applies to the grave. It is thus a fitting approximation of the Greek and Hebrew terms.<br>  In the inspired Scriptures these words are associated with death and the dead, not with life and the living. (Re 20:13) In themselves the words “Sheol” and “Hades” contain no thought or hint of pleasure or pain.|`|05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	Rev 20:14 says; D E A T H  and H E L L(King James Bible, other Bibles say Hades) are cast into the lake of fire, this is the second death. ???<br>  <br>  Where have you heard or seen anyone die 2 times?<br>  <br>  What is death? death is someTHING that happens to humans, it's a thing that happens, so death is a thing.<br>  <br>  What is Hell or Hades? hell is a place you go, so hell is a place.<br>  <br>  What is the lake of fire? that a place & a thing get cast in to? How can a thing die a second death? How can a place die a second death?<br>  <br>  Why would God cast Hell,Sheol,&Hades(all mean the grave) in to a burning lake of fire?<br>  <br>  Death & Hell, a place & a thing are cast into a burning lake of fire? Well my car is a thing, & my home is a place, how can you torture a thing or a place? Do people thing God will try to torture a thing or a place.<br>  <br>  We know that what's called the second death means a death with no resurrection, so the second death is symbolic of death eternal, Why would you say that Hell is literal, or that death can be burned with fire?<br>  <br>  When you read Rev 21:3,4 we find out that death will be no more, the former things have passed away.<br>  <br>  The Bible uses fire as something that totally destroys what ever it touches, so it's fitting when it says that death is thrown into the lake of fire, it will be gone forever.<br>  <br>  If we do not die, then there is no need for the grave, that's why Hell,Hades, & Sheol are cast into the lake of fire, both death & hell die forever, the second death. <br>  <br>  Ones who's minds have not been blinded by Satan(2 Co 4:4) know of the promise of everlasting life(John 17:3) right here on earth(Psalms 37:10,11,29.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Remember Satan told Adam and Eve that they would not die,we know that was a lie because he is the father of the lie.Well we know he lied because Adam and Eve are not here today they are dead.Well he is still telling that lie and people are sadly still believing it.|`|5pB2QAPUaa	The punishment for sin that God informed Adam about was simply death- not never ending torment. <br>  <br>  Genesis 3:19 'till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return'. (King James Version) This is where we received the expression 'dust to dust, ashes to ashes'. Of course, Jehovah never lies, so he could not have changed the punishment to literal hellfire. <br>  <br>  Further, the Lake of Fire spoken of in the Bible is clearly symbolic. Revelation 20:14,15 states "And death and Ha′des were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.  Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire". (New World Translation)<br>  <br>  What we are taught in the Bible is reasonable. The hellfire doctrine is clearly not a Biblical teaching.
09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	I'm an agnostic (nonreligious) for the reason that I think that it is impossible to know whether or not a creative entity (or deity) exists.  I am nonreligious, too, because I oppose the attempt by theists (particularly "Christians") to legislate their beliefs into law when our Constitution clearly forbids the establishment of a state religion.  During my maturing (although I was never devout) I gradually drifted away from religion, discovering that I am incapable of believing what can not be proved.  And finally, I resent the use of threats of eternal damnation by the adherents to fundamental religions as devices to control the masses.  (Religions are actually political organizations.)  If a creative consciousness does exist, one with the unimaginable genius to conceive and manifest a COSMOS, that entity (in my opinion) would not also be narrow-minded and vengeful and would be capable of understanding my (and others') inabilities to accept on faith religious dogma!|`|N4YfKm7qaa	I was brought up a Catholic, but, gradually, I found that the evidence for the lack of a God (mainly built on scientific reasoning) outweighed the evidence for (mainly built on ignorance).<br>  Being an atheist isn't much fun, however, as one leads a pretty nihilistic existence, but I can't deceive myself and force myself to have faith when I don't.|`|j0oU4V3baa	<--atheist|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Welcome<br>  <br>  And apparently we are here to answer this question 50 times a day.|`|UO3i8BqVaa	I was seven when I first heard about the invisible sky critter.<br>  I was surprised grownups could be so silly.<br>  I am still amazed.<br>  Monsters in the closet, under the bed, dancing about on cloudies awaiting requests?<br>  It’s nothing but ridiculous nonsense.<br>  I have NOT seen or heard anything in the interim to cause me to change my mind.<br>  ~|`|gQEFy4BVaa	Because I don't believe in god.

There's also the historic and cultural aspect of it. Even among believers there are disagreements on how to interpret the Bible (Jesus' teachings vs. Paul's writings, to give an example). I have, however, noticed that some members of many faiths seem to "diss" non-believers on the basis that "you don't believe what I believe so whatever 'good' you do is either non-existent or the act of a wolf in sheep's clothing."|`|s9sN9m3qaa	I believe a lot of people "diss" Christians for this reason.<br>  <br>  They see something in us which they cannot identify.

It is scary to think that something will happen to cut the population down to a suitable size for a creature that is part predator, part  farmer (scavenger).|`|jkW2b55Qaa	That's kooky talk.

5OucqEzFaa	Charles Taze Russell was the founder of the International Bible Students which subsequently became known as Jehovah's Witnesses. CTR was heavily involved in the Millerite movement back in the 1800's.  They, and lots of other Protestant denominations, were obsessed with trying to calculate when Jesus' second coming would be.  CTR modified some of Miller's calculations and came up with his own date - 1874. "Our Lord, the appointed King, is now present, since October 1874." Studies in the Scriptures, Volume 4, page 621.<br>  <br>  After Russell died and Rutherford was appointed as President, it became clear that Russell had got his dates wrong so they began to disassociate themselves from Russell's teachings. The International Bible Students were renamed Jehovah's Witnesses and the 'faithful and discrete slave' was now identified, not as CTR, but as a group of anointed witnesses. Also, the doctrine of 'the other sheep' was introduced - those who were not anointed with a heavenly hope, but who would now have an earthly hope, the number of the 144,000 being sealed in 1935. Around this time, Rutherford also made the Society a publishing corporation with members engaged as salespeople. This was a tactical ploy to wrest control of the society away from loyal Russellites - and it succeeded. 1914 was introduced as the date of Jesus' second coming. Only Jehovah's Witnesses knew this because, from 1919 they had become God's sole channel of communication.<br>  <br>  Why do we need to know about the origins and track record of Jehovah's Witnesses? Why do they place so much importance on dates and why do they get so cross when other people bring up the past? Because all of this has nothing to do with the gospel. That's right - the Gospel message is not about end-times and the date of Armageddon or when Christ will come again. The Gospel message is all about Jesus, the Christ, the Messiah, and what he accomplished at Calvary 2,000 years ago. The Gospel message is about God's eternal plan of salvation and redemption for sinful humanity. It's all about Christ Jesus and what he did.<br>  <br>  The point is that by concentrating on chronology, by trying to predict when 6,000 years of human existence since Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden so that a date can be established for Armageddon, focus is diverted from Christ Jesus and th gospel message. Jehovah's Witnesses are so pre-occupied with end-time prophecies and dates they've taken their eyes of Christ Jesus and what he accomplished 2,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  Are the teachings of this organisation solidly based on 1st century Christian belief? Did the early Christian church spend it's time and energies on trying to calculate when Jesus would come again? No. They devoted themselves to spreading the Gospel message and pointing people to Christ Jesus, because they knew that salvation comes only from accepting him as Lord and Saviour. They accepted that no man knows the day or the hour and they contented themselves in the knowledge that God's timing is perfect and so they did not even attempt to try and second-guess when Armageddon would arrive.<br>  <br>  It is sufficient to trust God and simply declare that the Kingdom of God is at hand - and point people to Christ Jesus. It does not matter if Armageddon comes this October or if the second coming of Christ Jesus will not happen in our lifetime. What does matter is that we live each and every day as if ti was going to happen tonight, so that when these earth-shattering and momentous events occur, we will not be found wanting.<br>  <br>  Why do people use 60 year old material from the Watch Tower Society to show how wrong their predictions have been? Not to 'slam them' but to point them to the true Gospel message so they will turn away from this false prophet and give themselves to Christ Jesus. Their eternal lives are at stake. Salvation does not come from believing in an organisation.<br>  <br>  P.S. Thumbs' up to Tim F! Outstanding!|`|41dbd5f49217df2a78323631830fd261aa	it should be clear evidence to show that their teachings change and their prophecies didn't eventuate.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	It doesn't matter what people slam us about.<br>  <br>  We have the truth<br>  <br>  <br>  (and jftr - Jehovah's Witnesses will talk to Jewish people... I dont know where Jim G got that ridiculous notion from)|`|oVHFz52Laa	It is good to remind them about the organizations history.<br>  If Jesus really appointed them as the only true Gods organization in 1919, we should go to old material to see what they were teaching.<br>  <br>  Their book " Finished mystery " was the most updated book at the time of alleged inspection....it is clear Jesus would  NOT appoint them as the only true God's organization because they were giving right spiritual food at the right time. They even taught the wrong year of Jesus' invisible return ..from heaven to heaven|`|R5MXZ9FFaa	Because their religion is obviously not the "Truth" when its own governing body supported and endorsed Hitler's government in their yearbook.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	The current material re opposing the Trinity is one of the most invidious pieces of material I have ever seen.|`|nVhP1Bteaa	I'd be more likely to keep up with the current JWs if they could explain in a reasonable manner why they won't talk to someone they know are Jewish.|`|AA10518714	I don't know why but I do like to stay current.  Lets forget the baseline and so what's new with JW now a day?|`|1d172da8266bc8049a171e749d536d67aa	Well the POINT is that everything they have ever published is supposed to be God's word, filtered through the Faithful Slave.  Only when there is "New Light" is the last thing written about the matter supersededby the new view.  <br>  <br>  So they've never caught up with all the old stuff, like the galaxy and star that God lives on.  One would think with so much time gone by that common sense would tell you that this or that thing would obviously no longer be valid.  But they'vve never put an expiration date on what they wrote.  They've even celebrated the writings of more than 100 years ago.  <br>  <br>  So if the JWs want to get mad at you, oh well. The problem is of the making of their leadership.|`|Fh3lH8jgaa	Because nondenominational churches have little history to be brought up, so it empowers them to point fingers.<br>  <br>  The so called "Born Again Christian" pastor at the church up the street preaches an entirely different message than the "Born Again Christian" pastor across town, but it works because they claim "Not to be of the same religion", or one broke away from the other so that he could interpret scriptures his own way.<br>  <br>  For Jehovah's Witnesses to say "look we were wrong about some things, and we aim to correct our understanding", imo that shows extraordinary willingness to be as honest as anyone can be despite the opinions of those not within the congregation.<br>  <br>  I also find it interesting that those that constantly bring up the history of Jehovah's Witnesses ( cough cough Unsilenced Lioness hi there, by the way why did you block me? )  fails to preach their version of the good news, or to produce scriptures to back it up.  Rather than pointing out what is right about their system of beliefs, they repeatedly look for fault in Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  Now Christ did say his followers would face the same type of opposition that he faced (from the saducees and pharisees).  And I would really hate to pull the persecution card at this point,  but honestly, if the shoe doesn't fit, stop forcing it onto our feet.<br>  <br>  K thanks bye.|`|JMi0TrC0aa	Why are JWs so obsessed with partially quoting our early Christian Churches and the early Christian writings by such people as Athanasius, Tertullius and others who they like to partially quote here at Y! A? Sure they like to show all the partial quotes (not the context) that show their side, but then they don't want to see our quotes of these Early Church Fathers showing Jesus is God. Do you know that  these JWs said the early Christians were apostates only after they saw our quotes? <br>  <br>  Then they will partially quote our current Trinitarian scholars. Do you know that they have no scholars for us to quote from? Nothing but their literature written by their so-called anointed? A lot of the quotes the JWs are using now are much older than our quotes, so I would say they are inadvertently pointing to themselves on the question of who is using 60+ years old materials, or 1500+ years old to be more exact.|`|VxTKNbJRaa	Slam Jehovah's Witnesses?<br>  <br>  NO!<br>  <br>  Loving Christians are trying to show the followers of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society that the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society is a FALSE PROPHET.<br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses by and large are sincere and kind. They do what they are taught to do and believe this is in the service of jehovah.<br>  <br>  The refutation of Watchtower error is not a personal attack.<br>  <br>  Many errors and apostate teachings are recent not a hundred years old.<br>  <br>  The Christian defends the true faith. The Watchtower has a tract record of flip flops and errors that can not be denied. The most intelligent of the followers eventually see this and leave.|`|Api5zLaeaa	I love the witnesses just not their leadership. So don't take the rest of this personally<br>  <br>  The Watchtower honestly want a good track record; just one that they can control. The way I see it, they currently pick and choose the historical items of their past to support their current doctrine. If their current doctrine is adjusted, they will go into to the past on specific items. This allows them the excuse to not include ALL of their historical documents within their Watchtower CDs and also keep their members in the dark. I have said before they DO NOT want their members to THINK FOR THEMSELVES. Witnesses! Your spiritual inheritance has been spent.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	Almighty God is eternal so 60 years is nothing. The problem is with the carrier of Gods word to modern times.

Protestant's did not claim Gods mouthpiece like the Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  Porcelain Vessel: claims they have the truth...it must be so because she is qualified in the dead languages to determine it.<br>  <br>  1972<br>  "So, does Jehovah have a prophet to help them, to warn them of dangers and to declare things to come? These questions can be answered in the affirmative. Who is this prophet? ... This 'prophet' was not one man, but was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students. Today they are known as Jehovah's Christian witnesses." Watchtower 4/1/72, p 197<br>  <br>  1889<br>  "In this volume we offer a chain of testimony on the subject of God's appointed times and seasons, each link of which we consider Scripturally strong ... it is beyond the breadth and depth of human thought, and therefore cannot be of human origin."

The Time Is at Hand, (1908 ed), p 101<br>  <br>  1914<br>  "The war will proceed and will eventuate in no glorious victory for any nation, but in the horrible mutilation and impoverishment of all. Next will follow the Armageddon of anarchy." The New York Times, 10/5/14, p 8<br>  <br>  1916<br>  "In the meantime, eyes of understanding should discern clearly the Battle of the Great Day of God Almighty now in progress; and our faith ... should enable us to see the glorious outcome -- Messiah's Kingdom." Watchtower Reprints, 9/1/16, p 5951<br>  <br>  1916<br>  "The Bible chronology herein presented shows that the six... days beginning with Adam are ended, and that the great 7th Day, the 1000 years of Christ's Reign, began in 1873." The Time Is at Hand, p ii<br>  <br>  1918<br>  "Therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old, particularly those named by the Apostle in Hebrews 11, to the condition of human perfection." Millions Now Living Will Never Die, p 89<br>  <br>  1920<br>  "As we have heretofore stated, the great jubilee cycle is due to begin in 1925. At that time the earthly phase of the kingdom shall be recognized .... Therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham...." Millions Now Living Will Never Die, 1920, p 89<br>  <br>  1922<br>  "The date 1925 is even more distinctly indicated by the Scriptures than 1914." Watchtower, 9/1/22, p 262<br>  <br>  1922<br>  "The date 1925 is even more distinctly indicated by the Scriptures because it is fixed by the law God gave to Israel. Viewing the present situation in Europe, one wonders how it will be possible to hold back the explosion much longer; and that even before 1925 the great crisis will be reached and probably passed." Watchtower, 9/1/22, p 262<br>  <br>  1923<br>  "Our thought is, that 1925 is definitely settled by the Scriptures. As to Noah, the Christian now has much more upon which to base his faith than Noah had upon which to base his faith in a coming deluge." Watchtower, 4/1/23, p 106<br>  <br>  Jan. 1925<br>  "The year 1925 is here. With great expectation Christians have looked forward to this year. Many have confidently expected that all members of the body of Christ will be changed to heavenly glory during the year. This may be accomplished. It may not be. In his own due time God will accomplish his purposes concerning his own people. Christians should not be so deeply concerned about what may transpire during this year that they would fail to joyfully do what the Lord would have them to do." Watchtower, 1/1/25, p 3<br>  <br>  Sept 1925<br>  "It is to be expected that Satan will try to inject into the minds of the consecrated the thought that 1925 should see an end of the work, and that therefore it would be needless for them to do more." Watchtower, 9/1/25, p 262<br>  <br>  1926<br>  "Some anticipated that the work would end in 1925, but the Lord did not state so. The difficulty was that the friends inflated their imaginations beyond reason; and that when their imaginations burst asunder, they were inclined to throw away everything." The Watchtower, p 232<br>  <br>  1931<br>  "There was a measure of disappointment on the part of Jehovah's faithful ones on earth concerning the years 1917, 1918, and 1925, which disappointment lasted for a time...and they also learned to quit fixing dates." Vindication, p 338<br>  <br>  May 1940<br>  "The year 1940 is certain to be the most important year yet, because Armageddon is very near.

One afternoon I was hanging out with my friends, including my crush and this guy comes into the picture and starts flirting with her and asking her to go out and stuff and I tried to leave but I couldn't because the people there always blocked the door and made me stay. Well, the guy was starting to get on my nerves and when he asked: "So... Will you go out on a date with me, pretty girl?" I just couldn't take it anymore, stepped up punched his face and said: "Dude! F*ck Off! Can't you see she's not interested? Why do you have to be so annoying!"<br>  <br>  He fell to the floor, everyone was shocked and when I realized what I did I appologized and tried to come up with a reasonable explanation. My friends knew why I reacted that way (they know I'm bi and that I like the girl that was being asked on a date by that guy) and I ended up telling my crush that I reacted that way because he was being very annoying. In the end, she thanked me for getting rid of the guy but also asked me to be more careful about my temper... xD|`|iPudBITBaa	hugs and kisses all over to you too!!!!! not the dog... just you...<br>  well mmm... one day i bought this gurl some flowers and a teddy bear... that's when i was into gurls... or at least i thought i was into them... anyways she like didn't want to go out with me so i wanted my teddy bear and flowers back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|E5I2gL5Laa	I have done everything in my power to get her a kitten.|`|v6tK8lhOaa	I vandalized the school so the girl I like would notice me...She did, but I got 5 days of suspension.<br>  <br>  It was soo worth it...but shhhh, that's our little secret.

59Wg2cI3aa	I know, I know, but who would want such a "keepsake" ?|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I would feel the same on the content of those letters.

Churches are all over the places|`|rU6nh42Eaa	It might be just your perception.  Another reason might be that there are more small churches.  Another reason might be that poorer neighborhoods are zoned for multi-use.  More affluent neighborhoods are purely residential, and although a church isn't quite like having a factory in the neighborhood, non-residential use is more restricted.  More affluent people tend to go to larger churches with many established programs.  Small and independent churches seem to make more inroads into the poorer populations.|`|GOaDQuhlaa	Its where faith is the strongest. Why would churches be built in a rich area where people have anything they can buy.. but a poor area where there is a struggle everyday just to survive. The people have hope. They have faith....

That's the stand<br>  <br>  Whether we agree or not, is irrelevant|`|yQNit56Qaa	I'm neither clergy nor Roman Catholic - but the logic is actually relatively simple.  The Roman Catholic logic goes like this:<br>  <br>  1) abortion IS murder<br>  2) immediate termination of the mother's pregnancy guarantees the death - the *murderous* death - of 2 people<br>  3) some more risky but feasible option may have enabled all 3 to live<br>  <br>  Understand that, from a pro-life Christian standpoint, having an abortion is no different than paying someone to murder your 5-year-old by smashing his skull with a golf club.  Really - there is no difference in the crime.<br>  <br>  SO, the Roman Catholic position is this:  **all** other options must be explored, **all** other possibilities attempted,  before murdering an infant is considered.<br>  <br>  I discovered, when looking into this, that premies (statistically) have a 50% chance of survival at the 24-week point.  Now, I realize that I am no doctor, and more importantly that I am not the mother's doctor.  Still, it does seem to me (SEEM!) that allowing the pregnancy to continue to a point at which the infants might survive birth by Caesarian Section is reasonable and would put the mother at minimal risk.<br>  <br>  It also seems to me that the doctors were treating the life of the mother as more valuable than both of the other lives involved.  They simply should have attempted *something* that would give the two infants a chance to survive - even if it were a miniscule chance.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|nHizaTiDaa	I read that- that the step-father was not ex-communicated!!!

qTRzRi8gaa	It's all about changing the 'tape' you have in your head.<br>  <br>  People who aren't confident have an inner monologue of thoughts to that effect.  Basically devaluing yourself and your efforts and perpetuating the lack of confidence.<br>  <br>  So you replace that 'inner tape' with a more positive and self assured one.  Something to the effect that encourages your efforts and maintains a positive outlook without getting down on yourself.<br>  <br>  Or, more simply stated, "fake it 'til you make it."  Eventually the charade of confidence will grow into real confidence.|`|arr9xM6Baa	Nice category man :)|`|CfP0jjzRaa	yea i was jus like u and still sortve cause when i talk to people i like but....on here asking this question everyone is gonna say "be urself" but that's not helping at all....i've learn to overcome my fears of talking because most people are nice and great to get to know..u know who's nice and who's rude u jus get that feeling. i've became very popular my high school years because i played sports so that give me alittle of super star and others a little of who i am..so this can give u confidence and high self esteem and when that happens more people will talk to u..idk if that helped but probably joing clubs at school, playing sports or instruments or just getting involved with the school and the community can help on ur shyness
HK4cW2Vcaa	Well, I would seriously talk to her about it. Make her understand exactly what abortion does and it's effects. If she still wants one, I cannot force her to keep it. I wouldn't want my daughter paying for someone elses crime, especially as life changing as rape and pregnancy due to rape. Although I'd prefer her to give birth and maybe put it up for adoption, but it would be her choice in the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Honestly, how am I going to make someone go through 9 months of pregnancy and birth. If she was dead set against having it, she'd get n abortion anyways with or without my knowledge.|`|GDexucXKaa	If it were my daughter, I would let her get an abortion if that's what she wanted to do. <br>  <br>  I would discuss other possibilities with her, but pregnancy is NOT pleasant (at least, it wasn't for me) and I would not force anyone to go through it if they didn't want to.|`|gC5eFMyTaa	Abortion? is a case of Legal Murder.

The fact still remains. If it is true that God has knit you together in your mothers womb than that baby still has a spirit and a future ahead of it. I have heard of stories where the mother did not get an abortion after being raped and then gave the baby up for adoption because she was too young. The baby grew up and did amazing things for the world. As difficult as it would be, you would have to trust that God would take this terrible situation and turn it into something good. <br>  <br>  Good Question|`|aJLXBhoAaa	If my daughter was raped it won't have been her fault and it won't have been the baby's either.

Having the child and then putting them up for adoption is ALWAYS the better choice than simply snuffing out the life of the child. The circumstances of their birth is not the child's fault, so it's undeserving of being murdered.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	What?<br>  <br>  The only good this that comes out of this is a life.<br>  <br>  Why destroy that?<br>  <br>  How about instead of killing the baby the rapist gets the death penalty.<br>  <br>  The guilty know what they are doing, the Innocent should not have to pay.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	You punish the criminal, not either of the two victims.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	I have seen this scenario MANY times. <br>  Always the last key piece of information is that the mother will forever resent her baby because it comes from rape. <br>  <br>  I think those type of scenarios don't give the human spirit enough credit.  They don't make allowance for enough compassion. <br>  We see the opposite happen ALL the time.. where mothers LOVE their babies despite the circumstances of their birth. We see this in war torn countries where women are raped. We see this in the US, where girls who are raped keep their babies. <br>  <br>  Secondily, <br>  <br>  These scenarios seem to indicate that Abortion was somehow instituted specifically for these reasons.  However, the original court case was not about that.  So the law was not originally constructed to address this issue.  Secondily, the law as it stands does not limit Abortion to these situations, therefore it seems in-material to argue in favor of it in those types of situation, IF the law is not limited to it and the original statutes of the law never even made mention of cases of rape. <br>  At the least, it seems like a very dubious way of justifying a law AFTER the fact. <br>  <br>  In either case... to answer your question...<br>  <br>  NO, I wouldn't abort the baby. It isn't to blame. It shouldn't pay for the rapists crime.  2 wrongs do not, and can never, make a right in a just and enlightened society.  Maybe 2 wrongs can make a right in a barbaric and/or Oppressive society,  but not a free and democratic one. NEVER. <br>  <br>  It is unfortunate that some school will be missed.  There are home study and other programs offered thru schools for that sort of situation. My sister utilized one during High School. <br>  Secondily, how the parents handle the situation and the dedication of the girl and the individual details of the situation will determine just HOW much this will ruin her future.  I would LIKE to see how you determine that and some evidence to support that this happens even 49% of the time.<br>  <br>  IF in your scenario the girl TRULY resents the baby.. then it can be put up for adoption. <br>  My wife and I can't have kids of our own.  Adoption is our only option. We'd love to get a baby like that. <br>  Explain to me why murder is better then adoption?<br>  <br>  <br>  Let's face it.. crimes happen and have LASTING impacts on people.  Rape is one of the MOST heinous of crimes.  Society CAN NOT remove all the consequences of crime, we simply can't..it's impossible. <br>  TRYING to erase all consequences may lead us down a dangerous path where we start breaking laws and violating principles,  SIMPLY to try and erase the impact of another person's actions. <br>  <br>  A just and enlightened society will try and HELP citizens deal with the consequences of crime... not erase the results. Focus on crime prevention not hiding the results after the fact..
UgX5WeGPaa	honesly.. i dont know what the hell i believe.  i was raised catholic but not pratcing.  i dont believe in the majority of it and i think i'm more Atheist than catholic, BUT i have christened my child and if i'm still in my neighborhood when he's school age, he'll be going to catholic school.  only b/c it's the best around.  <br>  i would not push my beliefs or anything like that on my child if that's what your looking for?  <br>  i'm not sure i quit understand your statement... i don't believe in much truth in anything.. there's not much i trust, i only want the best for my son and will stop at NOTHING to give it to him!!|`|l6Jew1qAaa	I'm female, but not aethist:<br>  Interesting question--do we, as females only see the truth in what we believe if we want to "share" this belief with others? No, females are capable of seeing the truth in what they believe, whether they share it or not. <br>  <br>  Anyway, what do you mean, its "slightly ironic regarding where it's coming from"<br>  <br>  And it does look like a penis...not that some men don't think they are "pretty" but a decoration?|`|NmsBFeNJaa	If you believe something then you already see the truth in it.<br>  All of humankind should do what is right for them, what helps them to be better people. However, it doesn't help anyone to pass judgment on others, force your belief on others, or in any way try to control the lives and actions of others because of your religious beliefs.|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	...........<br>  <br>  I don't think that is an absolute.  <br>  <br>  Can you believe something is true without wanting it for your family? <br>  <br>  I do appreciate my natural worldview and I do raise my child to have the same because I want her to have a clear idea of the world she lives in unclouded by superstition. That said, she is free to read learn and believe as she likes. <br>  <br>  I suppose you can believe something is true without wanting it for others. Some people might disagree though. <br>  <br>  Remember in the Matrix how there was one guy who regretted taking the red pill? He could not handle reality. He preferred an easy fantasy and was willing to kill his closest friends to get it. So I'd never push the red pill on another person, if I were in such a situation. Even though I am content and happy with the truth, they might not be and I cannot make their choices for them. That would negate personal responsibility. So I may share my ideas with others, but I do not force them. Who am I to decide for them that truth is rewarding? That is my personal standard of value. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also some truth is subjective. For me it it true that having a family and spending time with my child is the greatest pleasure in the world. For others that is simply not true. So why would I want it for them?<br>  <br>  EDIT: "well seeing as how atheism seems to be a self-centered way of life, the other follow-up question is irrelevant now"<br>  <br>  Selfish? We answered your question, some seriously and some with their best attempt at wit. You say "Thank you" when people give you what you asked for, dear. Or people who were raised right do. <br>  <br>  I am not selfish because I respect each individual's right to a free and responsible search for the truth. It is yours if you want it. If you do not, I respect that. There is no rule that says,"You must be happy or else. You must share my values or else." You are presumed an adult on here and as such may choose whatever life you prefer. If you want to be steeped in mysticism, so be it. Just don't try to make me join in and we'll all get along.|`|LHljEdcUaa	No i dont agree thats ridiculous... i see the truth, reality thats it even the reality of what my family and loved ones is. <br>  <br>  i guess it would be nice if we were all atheists but i would settle for all Buddhists..|`|RckU5Wbpaa	Do I want all people in the world to be rational, making decisions about what they believe based on meaningful, rational inquiry based on evidence, for them to be moral and altruistic and kind?

There are no fairytales, so there are supernatural beings.  My beliefs are rational.  My father, husband and son are all atheists and all came to their beliefs individually.  My father never pushed his atheism on me and I was free to choose my own beliefs, which is why I was a Baptist, a Conregationalist and a Mormon before realizing that I believed none of it.  We are all happy people.  I would want all of humankind to be atheist if they came to that belief on their own.  I would not push it onto them.  It's not a religion, it is a belief.|`|e0e3e97ecc5ec23822071f8a88c516b3aa	The reason I think man kind would be better off being atheist is because, I think it would cut this radical stupid ways of worship, taking the bible and using it as a tool for murder, torture, and insanity.. People read too much into it, and forget what the true message was. If you hate homosexuals, you are in no way a good believer, anyone you hate you are committing a sin.. Hate is the ultimate sin remember. But as for now, I agree if people had no religion, we would stop attacking one another and live peacefully. It's the religion and the ways of worship that make this world a dangerous place..|`|mC4mnvGFaa	Not necessarily <br>  and yes, I would like all humankind to be atheists.

I want each of my friends and family to be happy and at peace with themselves and enjoy their lives. If having religious beliefs allows them to do this - fine, even if they are beliefs different than my own.  And if they are perfectly happy being atheist, than that's just fine with me too.<br>  <br>  Truth, much like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.  And no, I wouldn't want all of humankind to think/believe/be exactly the same - that would make the world rather boring, don't you think?  But it would be nice if we could all accept that spirituality is not a "one size fits all" and perhaps get along a little better despite some petty personal differences in opinion.

The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at <a href="http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com</a> , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful. And anyone who has studied the biography of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, will not find any evidence of "extremism."<br>  <br>  ----<br>  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"<br>  <br>  What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?<br>  <br>  The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at <a href="http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com.</a> Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.<br>  <br>  Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)<br>  <br>  When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)<br>  <br>  Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)<br>  <br>  As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:<br>  <br>  "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)<br>  <br>  All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)<br>  <br>  Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)<br>  <br>  The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.<br>  <br>  When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]<br>  --------<br>  <br>  MY ADDITIONAL NOTE:<br>  For anyone interested in learning more, I encourage you to actually read the treatises of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab. Many of them are relatively short and amazingly beneficial. One would be hard-pressed to find anything from his essays calling to extremism. Rather, much of his work is simply about educating the common Muslim in the basics of Islamic Monotheism.<br>  <br>  Available below are links to the Shaykh's translated works (English Language):<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Four Rules (of Islamic Monotheism)"<br>  <a href="http://www.spubs.com/sps/downloads/pdf/TAW010001.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.spubs.com/sps/downloads/pdf/T...</a><br>  <br>  "The Three Basic Principles of Islaam"<br>  <a href="http://www.salafyink.com/aqeedah/UsooluthThalaathah.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.salafyink.com/aqeedah/Usoolut...</a><br>  <br>  "The Pillars, Conditions, and Requirements of Prayer"<br>  <a href="http://www.al-ibaanah.com/ebooks.php?EID=23" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-ibaanah.com/ebooks.php?EID...</a>|`|TbPcMYkfaa	Wahhabi way is best !!<br>  Shiites do not have the right to talk about anyone.

If you must keep them on, put them on 'vibrate' and leave the event proper (go outside the doors, in other words) to answer the phone.  It's also inappropriate to use a cell phone on a city bus if you can't speak low enough to 'not be heard' generally (although many may disagree with me, most bus riders and drivers will agree with me).  You should wait until you are off the bus, you should stand out of the way of people walking, and you should 'be aware' of what is going on around you.  It is never inappropriate to carry and use a cell phone to call for emergency services (911 in most of the US, but you need to know your location and the location of the 'emergency' when you are speaking to the dispatcher).  It may be 'okay' to use the cell phone in a grocery store if you need to 'check' on whether an item is actually needed (say a spouse is sick at home, and the other spouse who doesn't normally do the shopping is in the store) but step aside and speak as quietly as possible.  Most people think that speaking more loudly into their cell phone is 'good manners' because many have bad connections.  Many people think that talking on the phone is 'just the way things are' now ... but I disagree with this.  I do have one, and must carry it, because I've had two major heart attacks.  This phone is now used frequently to tell the time (those electronic clocks are much more accurate than a watch), but the 'phone' in the hands of every person, being used to 'talk to friends, family, etc., can cut a person off from speaking to passersby and friends with you ... which is both rude, but can get you hurt (you may not see that car coming straight at you because you are talking on the phone at the wrong time).  Speak as quietly as possible (shouting may be necessary and should be used ONLY when calling emergency services), and keep the phone in your pocket.  Bluetooth devices that are worn on a person's ear are even worse, because you can 'answer' while a real person is speaking to you ...|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	When you should be paying attention to someone/something else, when others can over hear you and sometimes in the company of others.|`|vjgsbhP3aa	Don't use it in church.

I think the reason some people talk so loud is because maybe there is noise in the background they are trying too talk over, but a lot of times I notices since the speaker of the phone is generally not by your mouth like a house telephone some seem to think if they speak normally they will not be heard so they raise their voice.|`|abbtXNjSaa	on dates, during school, with friends|`|ot9QVt9Gaa	Firstly it's INappropriate =)<br>  It's not that inappropriate if you are texting.<br>  Don't talk on the phone if you're in line, try to get out of the way of the crowd to talk. <br>  The reason they are so loud is because of all of the people around them, which is exactly my point.|`|AA10969163	During a social function (i.e out for dinner with friends/family, at someone's home, on a date), while you're at work, at a funeral/wedding, during a meeting/appointment, and while you're about to have your order taken or about to purchase something from a cashier.

So that is the root of the problem. <br>  <br>  And of course neither Christ nor his apostles say the Crucifixion as "good news for mankind." That idea came from Paul/Saul who said "Christ died for our sins."

I do not even know what counts as torture.  Having ones' toenails and finger nails pulled out, as happened to someone I knew, might count.  To me, music could be torture.  To some old people being shut up, all alone in a house as they cannot move is torture. <br>  <br>  But really surely torture is the infliction of deliberate pain and doing physical harm.  Other activities are more in the way of mind games, and these can happen anywhere, even at school.  <br>  <br>  Torture is not acceptable as it does not work.  Tudor and Start tortures were designed to get a confession and to find other conspirators; sometimes this did get the correct result, but not always and those in pain will say what is wanted.

But I also hate when someone uses their background (for this instance black ancestors) as a reason to get extra special privileges. To make this point more clear and prove it's not a remark against black people (or others of another color/race), let me give you an example of another discriminatory issue. When women (of which I am one) get promoted or hired just because they're women, it's insulting and offensive. If a woman gets passed over for a man, it's just as insulting and offensive. I wish gender, race, color, shape, whatever else people judge by, could be as anonymous in real life as it is online! I wish people truly were regarded as equals to each other. Too bad this utopia doesn't exist! But, again, I also HATE racist remarks. Every black person I have met (with the exception of one) has been a decent, upstanding person...period!

People need to behave themselves.|`|qpmGLd7laa	I think that while racism is pretty much retarded, it's a product of evolution that helps to maintain variety.  Let's say "racism" is specifically the lack of desire to breed outside your race - which it fundamentally is if you know anything about anything.  Okay, keeping in mind that genetic variety is what keeps a species (humans, here) alive despite environmental changes, we can say that variety is a function of racism.  If every human began interbreeding, we would develop into a single - less efficient - race.  How would it be less efficient?  If a new virus comes around, or the weather changes globally, or anything... and no human has the genes to combat these changes, the entire species will die.  On the other hand, if we maintain variety, at least one race may survive such changes or challenges.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying racism is justifiable, morally correct, or even useful given modern advances.  I am saying it's a natural function that you should tolerate to some degree.  Again, I'm going to say that I think racism is wrong!  We should not tolerate violence, but the majority of us tolerate it through inaction - that is, by breeding within our own race, and avoiding sexual contact with other races.|`|WUwdDxWMaa	I think everyone should be treated with respect they have BET here and i kinda consider it segregation in a way i think its wrong Theyre shouldnt be an only white or only black hispanic chinese chanels its like every race has a different chanell it should be whatever lets watch tv not oh your african you must watch BET|`|uHoOC8PPaa	i think your right but nowadays it seems white people are discriminated against also. it goes both ways.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	yes|`|NIUkYdL2aa	Yes, I hate it when my neighbour sau Ni**er when he talks about black people.|`|6YPNM71Iaa	yeah i hate it. im white and i feel kinda grateful. i feel like being racist is just dumb. like everyone has to find just something about someone that is different and hate them for it. if we were blue blobs, a racist would find someone who was just a little bluer and hate them.  its dumb and people are just dumb for being dumb.

The OT books are common to several religions.  Christianity was started by Jews.  Did they steal from themselves.

Do you just want to stir an empty pot?<br>  By the way, they couldn't be called the OT until there existed a NT.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	The Christian “Old Testament” is an adaptation and alteration of The Jewish Bible. Tanakh, is an acronym for the three sections of the Scriptures, the Torah (Pentateuch, first five books of Moses, Torah meaning teaching/law) the  Neviim (Prophets) and Ketuviim  (Writings or scriptures)<br>  Tertullian, early in the third century CE named the Christian amended version of the Tanakh the "Old Testament" *specifically* to designate it as having been superceded and done away with in contrast to the "New", despite the assertion within it's texts well over a dozen times from Genesis forward that it is an eternal testament (covenant).<br>  <br>  The Christian Bible's Old Testament (it’s adaptation of Tanakh) reveals that in many places there are significant translation differences rendering the meanings of the passages quite different. Not only are the books rearranged so that the books are not in the order of Torah, Prophets and Writings, but Kings, Ezra and Nehemiah are divided. The Protestant Old Testament contains roughly the same books; the Vulgate has additional texts added to the canon that were originally written in Greek. The Greek Septuagint (meaning 70) was originally referring to the Torah portion only, and in fact, that is the only portion that was translated by 72 scribes whose translations matched. The rest of Tanakh was translated from the Hebrew to the Greek over the course of about 300 years and scholars cannot tell who or when exactly any of them were translated. Yet the common name of Septuagint is now generally applied to the whole Greek translation. By the beginning of the first century CE, there were many different versions of each text that appeared, some of them with less accurate Hebrew to Greek, and during this time, many other texts appeared being originally written IN Greek such as the books of the Maccabees. By the time of the beginnings of Christianity, some of these texts of Tanakh had become so changed through the Hellenization (introduction of Greek philosophic concepts through language) that they were no longer adherent to Torah precept. The Hebrew Bible canon had been more or less "closed" since the time of Ezra/ Nehemiah (around 423 BCE) but of course, Jewish scribes still penned what was going on in Jewish life in Judea and wrote and discussed how to apply Torah to their lives. It has been debated by many Jewish scholars that if the Books of Maccabees had originally been written in Hebrew they may have been more readily accepted by Jews as Jewish texts..but as a part of Talmud, since the Tanakh was already formed..not as a part of our Bible. <br>  <br>  ****The Greek Septuagint called the Old Testament is not a Jewish document, but rather a Christian one. The original Septuagint, created 2,200 years ago by 72 Jewish translators, was a Greek translation of the Five Books of Moses alone. It therefore did not contain prophetic Books of the Bible such as Isaiah. The Septuagint as we have it today, which includes the Prophets and Writings as well, is a product of the church, not the Jewish people. In fact, the Septuagint remains the official Old Testament of the Greek Orthodox Church, and the manuscripts that consist of our Septuagint today date to the third century C.E. The fact that additional books known as the Apocrypha, which are uniquely sacred to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Church, are found in the Septuagint should raise a red flag to those inquiring into the Jewishness of the Septuagint.<br>  The fact that the original Septuagint translated by Jewish scribes more than 22 centuries ago was only of the Pentateuch and not of prophetic books of the Bible such as Isaiah is confirmed by countless sources including the ancient Letter of Aristeas, which is the earliest attestation to the existence of the Septuagint. The Talmud also states this explicitly in Tractate Megillah (9a), and Josephus as well affirms that the Septuagint was a translation only of the Law of Moses in his preface to Antiquities of the Jews. Moreover, Jerome, a church father and Bible translator who could hardly be construed as friendly to Judaism, affirms Josephus' statement regarding the authorship of the Septuagint in his preface to The Book of Hebrew Questions. <br>  <br>  In fact, Dr. F.F. Bruce, the preeminent professor of Biblical exegesis, keenly points out that, strictly speaking, the Septuagint deals only with the Pentateuch and not the whole Old Testament. Bruce writes, "The Jews might have gone on at a later time to authorize a standard text of the rest of the Septuagint, but . . . lost interest in the Septuagint altogether. With but few exceptions, every manuscript of the Septuagint which has come down to our day was copied and preserved in Christian, not Jewish, circles."*****<br>  <br>  The accuracy of the words we see now in the Hebrew Bible was confirmed with the findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls where fragments of each book except the book of Esther (the last book to be included in the canon) match quite well with the Tanakh's Jews use today. The majority of the Dead Sea scrolls were written in the Hebrew Language (approximately 90-95%) with Assyrian Block script. From this majority there are a few cases in which the scribes used Paleo-Hebrew (see for example 4QPaleoExodus). <br>  Modern Hebrew is different from the ancient Paleo Hebrew, but the Hebrew of 2000 years ago is closer to modern Hebrew than the English of the 1700’s is to the English we speak today. <br>  <br>  There was a council of rabbis and scribes at Jamnia in 90 CE who worked hard to rid the Tanakh of the Hellenized versions of scripture that were being spread. Christian apologist scholars often try to claim that this was when the Jewish Bible's canon was FORMED in response to Christianity, but that ignores that their very own writings refer to it as a formed work already. Some of the texts that Judaism never considered as a part of Jewish scripture were early apologetic attempts to tie in Christian dogma to the Tanakh. Others show pre-Christian attempts to Hellenize Judaism. These texts known as Pseudepigrapha were largely written between 200 BCE and 100 CE and included great amounts of Greek philosophy. <br>  Hellenized apostate Jews who were working hard to mingle in Greek god worship and philosophy were largely responsible for most of the Greek translations of the Prophets and Writings that survived to form parts of the Christian Bible..they weren't texts used by people of the Jewish religion who continued to use the original Hebrew.<br>  <br>  You can discover on your own with comparative reading where key passages stand out to change meanings. One well-known portion is in Isaiah. The word lucifer does not appear at all in the Hebrew Bible. It is only in the Christian Bible’s translation from the LATIN, ( not even the Greek!) ..lucifer means morning star in Latin. The Hebrew word Isaiah wrote is heylel, meaning star. In the English translation of the Christian Old Testament they make the Latin word lucifer into a proper name ( Lucifer) and then personify the word referring to the planet Venus in a passage that Isaiah slams Nebuchadnezzar for styling himself the god/man representation of Venus (the morning star) on earth. Isaiah is condemning a human for calling himself a god. There is no fall of angels in the Hebrew Bible. There is simply no such thing as a Lucifer who became a demi-god of an underworld hell to be found in the Tanakh. Therefore, mistranslation can change things around quite a bit. <br>  <br>  Most of the book of Daniel and portions of Ezra and a single sentence in Jeremiah are in Aramaic, a related language using Hebrew letters. All else in the Jewish Bible was written in Hebrew. <br>  <br>  By the logic of the Christians here, why are they not following the Quran? And then in turn..why are they not following the Book of Mormon? If Israel's eternal covenant with God can be "superceded" why can't yours?<br>  <br>  Torah, Nevim and Ketuvim (Tanakh ) never made claim that God is exclusive to the people of the *eternal*covenant of Israel, but that the people who embrace it are exclusive to God . <br>  <br>  The righteous of all nations merit the world to come. All humans are equal before God and may connect to God directly.<br>  That is what the ETERNAL Testament teaches within its pages. Shalom.|`|XCzpQvDvaa	Christians, catholics, jews and muslims all believe in the same god, they just have different prophets. I wouldnt doubt it if someone stole someone elses story 2000 years ago and slapped it into their own book...happens alot today too.|`|jej0Vnudaa	Christians did not *steal* the Old Testament.  The Old Testament is a part of the Christian faith.  Now, that said, it is also a part of Judaism.  Why?  Because Christianity came out of Judaism.  You must also keep in mind that many later Jewish writings are not a part of Christianity the same way that the later New Testament is not a part of Judaism. <br>  <br>  They are two different faiths, but they share a common scripture.<br>  <br>  I might also add that Muslims tend to view what they perceived to be the original Torah and Gospels to be the word of God as well.<br>  <br>  By the way, the Old Testament was not changed by the Christians either.  But there has been some dispute over what books constitute the Old Testament (e.g. the Apocrypha).|`|pqveENjUaa	Sarah's right. Christianity used to be Judaism. The only difference is Jesus is accepted as the savior by the Christians and not the Jews. Thus, Christians wrote a couple new books to piece onto the end of it about Jesus and his disciples. They called that the bible.|`|y2pErbI2aa	They didn't steal the scriptures. Christians and Jews believe in pretty much the same things. The one big difference is that Christians believe Jesus was the Messiah, but the Jews don't. <br>  <br>  Christians were originally founded by Jews, and Jesus himself was a Jew. Of course they would still consider the old texts sacred. They are still an important part of the Christian history, giving a back story to the rise of Christianity|`|CBE0udvtaa	Christianity is Judaism, except add Jesus.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Christians did not "steal" anything.  No one calls the books of the Old Testament anything but what they are; scripture.  We didn't rename them!|`|AA11690436	No.  Three hundred years before Christ, the Jews sent seventy-two scholars to Alexandria to make a translation from the Hebrew into the Greek for inclusion in the Great Library of Alexandria.  This was a thank you gesture because both Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Soter left Israel unharmed while conquering Egypt.  So when the Ptolemy the second requested a translation of the sacred literature, they obliged.  This was called the Septuagint.  When the council of Nicea met in 325 CE, it was included along with various gospels and epistles from the early church fathers.  Some books that had in the six hundred years since, been dropped from the Hebrew cannon made it into the Christian bible, while several alternative gospels didn't make the cut.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Whooops.  My bad.  I didn't know the septuagint was only the five books of Moses.  Thanks for the correction Mama.

I went to the spiritualist church in Adelaide to find out why,  their must of being a reason dying so young. Trace was born with heart and lung problems.The people(from the church) told me Tracey had come to give me valuable life lessons and how.  From time to time and look at what Trace did in situations and most of the time  I apply them to certain situations. Trace had a love for every one,she live life life if there was no tomorrow. the hard one for me is to take people at face value(because there are so many con people). Some people treated her harshly,but she for gave them. I wish I was as strong as that.I consider myself Fortunate to be Tracey's mum.When I was working on the check out years ago. I got talking to a young man, he looked at me (I new who he was) i said to him do you know who I am he said yes I know you are Tracey's mum I nearly leapt the counter to give that young man a hug, I held back my tears (as I was still working, i don't know how) I honestly thought I would not hear those wonderful words again "Tracey's mum".

Granted, you still will, but if you're aware of it you can see the signs and try to counteract it.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Yeah....it takes away racism and instead develops a "superiority complex" of Us vs. Them....Believers vs. Non-Believers.  Very nice.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Nationalism is a thrill of the soul, a heedless pleasure, an inauspicious power. For this reason those occupied with social life at this time cannot be told to give up the idea of nationalism. However, nationalism is of two kinds. One is negative, inauspicious, and harmful; it is nourished by devouring others, persists through hostility to others, and is aware of what it is doing. It is the cause of enmity and disturbance. It is because of this that the Hadith states:' Islam has abrogated what preceded it, and put an end to the tribalism of Ignorance'<br>  The above Hadith rejects in definite terms any negative nationalism and racialism. For positive, sacred Islamic nationhood leave no need for them.<br>  What race is there that has three hundred and fifty million members? And which racialism can gain for those who subscribe to it so many brothers -and eternal brothers- in place of Islam? Negative nationalism has caused untold harm in history.|`|Ijhk7QD4aa	Oh yes indeed it is. if you follow islam how allah intended it, you will be at peace with everybody.

How this process began which took place in the darkness itself—in the dark womb of space where God was in the process of his Own Self-Creation. He was atom itself, spinning and evolving in this darkness of space and orbs of consciousness. He alone defined what and who we are from the explosion of the first atom of thought. Therefore, his make corresponds to the “dark matter” or material of darkness out of which he produced himself to become mathematically the number one and woman is key to kingdom of Heaven or Advance Civilization.<br>  <br>  Our own beginning bears witness to the beginning of the Universe. The very secret of how the Universe began is wrapped up how we began in woman womb.  We don't know the Universe, because we don't know God, because we don't know ourself. Look at the sperm.<br>  The woman is made after the womb out of which God created Himself, and in the woman is the Secret of God, She is Second Self of GOD.<br>  <br>  They taught us these are GOD SCIENTISTS or SUPREME SCIENTIST(GODS) they are not green and gray beings thats all frabrication etc.  They have WIVES and CHILDRENS, they life span up to 500 yrs - some nearly 1500 yrs.   Bible teaches us when GOD comes, not a spook hee will prolong the people lives or extended it.  They are true author of BIBLE and QURAN that includes sacred books of the world. Bible call them 24 Elders and Quran call them Exalted Chiefs or Angelic Beings.  There are twelve (12) major scientists and twelve (12) minor scientists thta includes 7 Angels or 7 Coucels more of them(civilization). Been here trillions of yrs and eons, they seeded Earth and Mars, others.  These are the real power behind the universe !<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches us that God made man in His own image and His own likeness. It teaches us that He breathes, sorrows, sees and hears, loves and hates.  What about the Holy Qur'an? The Holy Qur'an uses the personal pronoun "I". The "I" belongs to whom? It uses the soft pronoun "We". Does God have associates? Does He have partners? Why say "We"? God Himself revealed the book and knows best the language. Why did He use the language of a human being? <br>  Who is God? <br>  <br>  The Attributes in the Holy Qur'an are not the Attributes of a Spirit, they are the Attributes of man in whom the Spirit dwells. Allah is the Beneficent, the Merciful, the Powerful, the Life-Giver, the Sustainer, the Securer, <br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.” Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come.

If  they see something in a belief system that strikes them as profound, they want to please the father figure (God) by doing His will. It gives them a feeling of spiritual fulfilment.<br>  <br>  But a lot of religions have alternative interpretations people don't look hard enough for.

Ask if the policy is based on your age now and if it will get more expensive as you age. Some policies are the same price for the whole area irregardless of your age. Do they use medical review before you are allowed to get a policy and if so do they consider pre-existing condition and how for what period are you not covered.

With numerous references to the Christian Greek Scriptures, Justin expresses his belief in the resurrection, Christian morals, baptism, Bible prophecy (especially concerning Christ), and Jesus’ teachings. Regarding Jesus, Justin quotes Isaiah, stating: “The government shall be upon [Christ’s] shoulders.Papias believed in the coming Millennial Reign of Christ. (Revelation 20:2-7) According to Irenaeus, he wrote of a time “when creation, renewed and liberated, shall yield an abundance of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven and the fertility of the earth, just as the elders, who saw John, the disciple of the Lord, related that they had heard how the Lord would teach about those times.” Papias further wrote: “To believers these things are credible. Eusebius stated: “It is my purpose to write an account of the successions of the holy Apostles as well as of the times which have elapsed from the day of our Saviour to our own; to relate how many and important events are said to have occurred in the history of the church.. Moreover, in support of the divine authorship of the Scriptures, he wrote 35 books, considered to be the most important and elaborate effort of its kind. Josephus was a soldier he wrote down the history of Jerusalem being destroyed and it's people taken to Babylon.This in itself proved Jesus Prophesy to be true,Truly I say to YOU, By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.”<br>  The Bible is the word of God and all these men were faithful in upholding it and speaking about Christ.In exception of Josephus but knowingly or unknowingly he proved by what he wrote that Jesus was the Messiah by his prophecy of Jerusalem being fulfilled and this happened 40 years after Jesus death ?Man can't predict tomorrow.How could he have done such a thing and his predictions in Matt 24 Mark 13 and Luke 21 are still coming true today.|`|DgJDRA2eaa	your question is very long my friend,try to do it shorter next time.

34sidlx2aa	In the UK its common to start conversation with a bit of small talk, such as "how are you".  <br>  <br>  How interested they are in a genuine answer and how you reply would depend on how well you know the person. If it is someone who you are close to you might answer with a genuine answer, if it is some one you know but are not particularly close to you might give them a genuine answer, but keep it short.    If you don’t know them then they are asking to be polite and generally your answer should be kept short and positive. So you might say something like “I’m fine thanks, how are you” <br>  <br>  You will find that in England people tend use a degree of small talk when talking with strangers,  so its common to ask how someone, or if you are talking on the phone what the weather  is like.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Yeah. You too?<br>  It's a form of greeting and you don't expect to get an answer straight from their latest doctor's report.<br>  By the way, now that you are in the UK alright spelt as one word is all wrong. In the UK, it's 'all right'. OK?<br>  Hello Dustin! When I log in I type Yahoo answers UK.<br>  We speak English and only God knows what you guys in the US of A speak.<br>  The language was developed in the UK. It's been messed up since then, but that doesn't give you the right to think your version is the only 'correct' version of the language. Try Australian, South African, Indian and Pidgin! You'll begin to think British English is easy.|`|BO3KBsPIaa	Dustin, The language is ENGLISH, we invented it, so if anyone is getting it wrong its you, you idiot.<br>  <br>  I just say "alright" back, with a slight inclination of my head. People who say alright tend to be aquaintances and neighbours, its just a friendly gesture to anknowledge someones precense without entering into conversation with them.<br>  <br>  Its a bit strange now i think about it, ive never really analysed "alright's" before!<br>  <br>  I hope your having a good time in england. Make sure you visit buckingham palace on a red bus and have a cup of tea there :)|`|arr9xM6Baa	Depends on who's saying it really...<br>  and the way they say it. If they say it as a quick, off the shoulder remark, its generally a greeting, equal to hello or hi<br>  but you'll find that when most people say 'you alright', they're actually asking if you are alright.<br>  <br>  Not too difficult really<br>  <br>  :)|`|sOZoonICaa	im english and i say im fine thank you how are you if they don't answer then they shouldn't ask the question so it may be just a few weird people you have met.|`|1f9aDH2Baa	Hi, fine, yourself?|`|vQ75GgNnaa	No I'm half left.|`|DJLeObm4aa	Well we Scots can have our differences with the English and vice versa but have you never heard the expression When in Rome do as the Romans do? You have to accept the ways of a new country and anyone asking "You alright?" do not mean any offence. When in US everyone saying "Have a nice day" really seems so hypocritical and false but I appreciate it is a customary expression and would not expect the US people to change their ways for me. What you are saying in answer is fine IF in fact you are fine. However I would bet my last penny(or should I say dollar?) if someone said that to you and you looked at them in dismay, burst in to tears showed emotion or began to tell them about a big problem you had you would receive nothing but empathy and help. Just give the people around you a chance I think you are jumping to conclusions stating it is a  'cold' English society and that's from a Scots woman. Good luck and I wish you well for your life in UK.|`|g6ENt03Oaa	I know how you feel. It's annoying especially when you get asked 'are you alright?' 1000 times... My husband is from cali too and I guess I pick up his habits lol. Yes you are expected to say 'I'm fine' and unless it's a close friend your not meant to tell them if your not or your tired. If people I'm close too say 'are you alright?' I userally say something like 'yeah but I'm really tired' or 'ugh I have a headache' and genrally they would offer me pain pills lol.<br>  There are certain expectations with language.If you have any issues you can message me.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	Yeah, we can be ignorant sometimes. But I just usually lie and tell them, yeah im good how are you? or yeah im fine. We normally use this as a type of greeting, or to make small talk.<br>  <br>   If your having troubles, and someone you know and trusts asks you this, then be honest and tell them how you really feel.|`|jTKYXB9Xaa	The ENGLISH cold??<br>  <br>  Compared to the AMERICANS??<br>  <br>  Please lol.<br>  <br>  FYI it's a friendly, collouquial way of saying hi.  Like "Alright mate"<br>  <br>  Get over it lol|`|O5KOwhovaa	When people in the UK ask "You OK?" or "You Alright?" they tend to always mean it.<br>  <br>  Just say "Yeah, I'm OK/Alright" and things will be fine.<br>  <br>  You don't need to ask how they feel in return.|`|NImJALxgaa	Hahaha "You alright?" Is just a greeting and its much more nicer than people just shouting "OI YOU" <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and @ Dustin, Yes hello and who put you in charge of the English language?|`|T5uOsAgraa	i agree it is very cold just answer with good or not bad but dont wait for a reply, its just a way of saying hi so not to be rude|`|hQA8Ql21aa	I usually just say yes im good or yes im fine but i don't ask it back|`|gzaK0svGaa	"Are you alright?"<br>  <br>  No, I'm half left.|`|RmSzWzbsaa	i just say fine thanks|`|SXQ3K6z6aa	just tell em "Iben Jakenhawf" lol nah just kidding well i lived in the uk from when i was 10 to when i was 12... in UK its just a form of hi... buut..... if it is the opposite sex of you... its usually a come on... but!, dont take that to my word its not always a come on just say something like yih... i bin doin alright... bin a bit down lately tho... haow bout your self?? and ask in the accent i poorly tryep to type out :P and if they ask y uve been down... they care... and you should get to know them better... if they just say good and change the subject they just want convo... so yeah hope i helped... :D|`|ZWD4No9kaa	Hmm. A lot of British people are very cold and vitriolic, it's true, you only have to pick up a copy of the Daily Telegraph or the Daily Mail to realise that. But I find that on the whole, when someone asks, "You all right?" or "You okay?" that they generally mean it - and what they mean is "How are you feeling?" So, I would say, you were right to respond, "I'm fine, thanks, how are you?" (or whatever) and to expect an answer back. What I find odd is that you say you're not receiving "anything back". I can only assume that you must be moving amongst wealthy or privileged circles? People who were privately educated perhaps (at Eton, Harrow or one of those schools), in other words, people who would turn their noses up at you and think you were an "inferior little man" - well, you can ignore those people. We all know what they can do with their airs and graces. I find it hard to believe that you might be socialising with ordinary working class folk, because they would always offer you a warm and sincere welcome.<br>  <br>  Maybe, just try to imagine that they're being genuine, treat them like they're genuine and see what happens. It might just be a simple case that you're making yourself too anxious over this!|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi all you have to answer is either cushty or sweet as ! but then it depends what sort of enviroment your in & the sort of people that your with at the time . sly|`|Tr24mmt7aa	It sucks to be you! I would hate moving to a new coutry!<br>  <br>  LOL my BFF was born in the UK. But i have never heard anyone in her family say that. Sry.|`|xyPpruSjaa	Hi! In the state I live in in the USA, when someone says "You alright?" or "You okay?" its because someone might've tripped or fell or got hurt in a minor way.<br>  <br>  I never really thought of it as a way of saying hi. Now that I think about it and say it out loud in different tones, it does seem kind of like a greeting to me! It depends on your tone of voice. If you sound concerned and worried it would be in a situation where someone got hurt. If it was just in a casual 'every day' tone, it would mean something like "Hi" or "Hey what's up?"<br>  <br>  Good luck in California!! No offense taken by the way.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	LOL i had the exact same problem, i've actually made up rules for these situations lol, if they are walking past quickly just say not bad (cause they ment hello anyway), if they say it like they actually care, say im alright, you? <br>  i have found the two best ways though, GET THERE FIRST as soon as you see them, say you alright? then they have to figure out which one you mean, or smile and nodd to them or just say hiya.|`|lwXEK969aa	It is just a way of saying hello, just reply with "alright" or "yeah alright" or even just nodd|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	It's just a manner of speaking and the only answer is yes fine thanks and you or something similar. There are many stories of accidents about men have lost a leg and have blood pouring all over them and the first thing the the first aider or ambulance man says is: "Are you are right mate?" <br>  <br>  Of course there are others' in which the first aider says, "Ok mate we've got your left leg here and we've just found the other one in the next field!"   This can in it's way be reassuring because no first aider would say that to a man who has lost both legs
AA11047076	Not in the Christian sense.<br>  <br>  The word "satan" is merely the Hebrew for "Accuser"- and the ANGEL in that role is generally referred to as HaSatan "the accuser".  <br>  <br>  Like all angels, HaSatan does not have free will and merely carries out an assigned role.  What is the role of HaSatan?  To "prosecute" us in other words- eh is the angel that places all our wrong deeds before G-d when we are judged.  A good illustration of this is in Sefer Iyov (The Book od Job)- haSatan come to G-d and questions Iyov's virtue- G-d then tests Iyov.  However, haSatan is unable to act or do anything without the explicit permission of G-d;  he cannto work against G-d, he is not in opposition to G-d- indeed, in Judaism that is impossible since all supernatural forces are directly under the control of G-d- and the Aseret HaDibrot (ten Commandments) make it explicit that we cannot put any other supernatural forces in opposition to g-d "You will have no other gods before Me!"|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	To add to what allonyoav said--there is a famous Talmudic story in which the Jews actually captured Ha-Satan.  Not knowing what to do with him, they put him into a barrel for three days.  To make a long story short, they ultimately blinded him in one eye but let him go, realizing that the "negative" aspect of humanity is a necessary part, when balanced by the good aspects, to a functioning, productive human being.|`|tkSll6Gtaa	yes its the same devil as everywhere else
0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	The obvious reason was one of terrible fear,fear for their own lives and also afraid to look at the whole area of human pain and suffering especially when it pertained to the Jesus whom they truly loved.<br>  It is not hard to understand this concept as we all try to weave our way around the horror of suffering, one thing is for certain though, the cross of Jesus shows us  the awful fact of suffering and we may well try to go around this cross or over it, yet the true follower of Christ knows well that he must go through it, peter and the others finally discovered this when they to were called to martyrdom.<br>  God bless.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Ten stayed away out of fear.

Judas was off doing his Judas thing, only "the Three" (Peter, John, and James) were present at the arrest and while we have no idea what James did after the arrest John and Peter followed the guards and stayed close to know of the trial rather than alerting the other eight.|`|HMteUyRdaa	They, at least 10 of them were cowards, they needed the Holy Spirit on Pentecost to provide them with the gift of Courage.<br>  <br>  St.John of the Cross the beloved of Christ was there because he couldn't stay away, he loved Christ and the Blessed Mother so much he had to be there. <br>  <br>  Pray the Rosary|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Because one hung himself and 10 were scared that they too would be crucified.....According to scripture John was present.|`|xxEhpytpaa	You have two great answers above me (Sentinel and Kate)and they are correct, But St. Peter was so upset for denying Jesus, as Jesus said he would, He couldn't bear to watch them crucify Jesus. It is said that from then on St. Peter cried every day for the rest of his life and that the tears wore grooves in the flesh of his face from the tears. He also was hung on a cross and asked to be hung upside down, for he was not worthy to hang as Jesus hung on the Cross. God bless you.|`|vQ75GgNnaa	Where I am going you cannot follow me.<br>  Only jesus was able to die with all the sin of the world on His shoulders.<br>  Yes, the Apostles feared death if they were captured, but their mission was about to start, no reason why any of them should have died on the cross with Jesus on that day.<br>  It was Jesus darkest hour and the Father knew that only Him could bare it. No other human could or can die like Jesus did.<br>  But what happens after His death is even more amazing, He goes in the world of death to save those who died not knowing Him and in so doing He defeats death and Satan forever.<br>  Death where is your victory?<br>  He has set us free.<br>  Does anybody know a better hero?|`|SHtTPBieaa	Fear that they would be hanging next to him.<br>  <br>  After all crucifixion wasn't reserved for Messiahs.

xFqlUbQIaa	And Jesus' bloodline was accursed from Moabite ancestry, Ammonite ancestry and lustious relations that god cursed in the old testament.<br>  Jesus Christ, according to Deuteronomy 23:2-4 is _disqualified_ as being God's annointed Messiah for the following reasons:<br>  1. He has Moabite blood via Ruth (Ru 4:13-22), the great-grandmother of king David.<br>  2. He has Ammonite blood via Naamah (1 Ki 14:21,31) the wife of king Solomon and mother of king Rehoboam.<br>  3. He is a descendant of Ben-ammi, A BASTARD who was conceived in an incestuous act between Lot and his younger daughter (via Naamah's Ammonite ancestry). Note: a bastard is a person born outside of holy wedlock or marriage. We are not informed Lot "married" his daughters.<br>  4. He is a descendant of Moab, A BASTARD who was conceived in an incestuous act between Lot and his older daughter (via Ruth's Moabite ancestry).<br>  Deuteronomy 23:3<br>  "No Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly of the Lord, even to the tenth generation none belonging to them shall enter the assembly of the Lord for ever, because they did not meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came forth from Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you."<br>  Ruth 4:13-22 RSV<br>  "So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife, and he went in to her...and she bore a son...They named Obed; and he was the father of Jesse, the father of David. Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron of Ram, Ram of Amminadab, Amminadab of Nahshon, Nashon of Salmon, Salmon of Boaz, Boaz of Obed, Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David."<br>  <br>  In a nutshell: Both David and Christ ARE ACCURSED BY GOD because of their Moabite ancestry via Ruth the Moabite who married Boaz.|`|6709f9f8b081a814a21bfcf6aade68e3aa	I dunno.

Gf5nMPJXaa	A while back.  Their view of Jesus is the most interesting bit I remember.<br>  <br>  Ironically it both contains and commands less bloodshed than the Bible despite the current cultural prejudice.<br>  <br>  Here's a great link to the skeptics' Quran with verse by verse links to contradictions, absurdities and so on.  I'd recommend reading a Surah then going through it in this link and reading the notes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/" rel="nofollow">http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and this link is yet another debunking of the silly lie that skeptics focus only on Xianity and "dare not" criticize Islam.<br>  <br>  EDIT Woops somebody above beat me to it!  Just to add more info I'll point out that this site lists over 500 instances of cruelty and violence in the Quran.  Absolutely shocking and awful.......but the Bible contains over 900 using the same source and criteria.|`|VncSMLMpaa	Some of it. Bits of it sound like regurgitated Scripture. However, perhaps because Mohamed couldn't read and write he seems to have got a whole lot of Biblical facts wrong. It was Isaac through which the promises came and who Abraham would have sacrificed at God's command, but Mohamed had it that it was Ishmael, the son of the handmaid.<br>  <br>  I believe it is claimed that this book came via the Angel Gabriel yet what is said is in opposition to what he said in the Gospels. The Gospels came long before the Qu'ran. Gabriel says that Jesus is the son of God, Mohamed says he was only a prophet. He certainly seems to have got off message.|`|3m00lxxuaa	Use discernment!!!!

Don't just take the verses without even knowing their history because i tell you that there is like history behind nearly every verse<br>  Some verses are repetitive throughout so that they can be remebered and recited more easily|`|jard50Yiaa	The Qur’an is the central religious text of Islam. Muslims believe the Qur’an to be the book of divine guidance and direction for mankind, and consider the original Arabic text to be the final revelation of God.<br>  <br>  Islam holds that the Qur’an was revealed to Muhammad by the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from 610 CE to his death in 632 CE. The Qur’an was written down by Muhammad's companions while he was alive, although the prime method of transmission was oral. In 633 CE, the written text was compiled, and in 653 CE it was standardized, distributed in the Islamic empire and produced in large numbers. The present form of the Qur’an is regarded as God's revelation to Muhammad by Muslim believers. Academic scholars often consider it the original version authored or dictated by Muhammad. Muslim tradition agrees that it was fixed in writing shortly after Muhammad's death by order of Umar and Abu Bakr.<br>  <br>  Muslims regard the Qur’an as the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with those revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with the Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), and the Injeel (Gospel). The aforementioned books are not explicitly included in the Qur’an, but are recognized therein. The Qur’an also refers to many events from Jewish and Christian scriptures, some of which are retold in comparatively distinctive ways from the Bible and the Torah, while obliquely referring to other events described explicitly in those texts.<br>  <br>  The Qur'an itself expresses that it is the book of guidance. Therefore it rarely offers detailed accounts of historical events; the text instead typically placing emphasis on the moral significance of an event rather than its narrative sequence. Muslims believe the Qur'an itself to be the main miracle of Muhammad and a proof of his prophethood.|`|HIskrREJaa	No, but I would like to read it too someday out of interest. You should make another post when your done from the atheist perspective.|`|AA10093245	Yes, I have read it several times. I find it much easier to understand than the bible.  As for prophecies, it does not have a chapter similar to Revelation in the bible. It does talk about "when the sun rises in the west" which I thought was interesting, in light of the so-called predictions of the earth reversing it's orbit in reference to 2012.<br>  You can read the entire thing in a day or a weekend though, unlike the bible. <br>  It's not in chronological order like the bible, but goes from longest chapters to shortest.<br>  With you being an atheist, the particular verse that came to my mind for you to notice is 2:6.|`|digPrN5Saa	Peace<br>  <br>  I definitley agree with "lakota".  The Quran cannot be taken for what is.  One verse in the Quran may contain a whole story by itself.  When you read you must also ask your self why, when, who,where, how and what to get a good understanding of the verse.  For example you might come across a verse that says to "kill the infidels".  It may not occur to you that it is only stressing this idea of killing when you are being attacked and wanted dead.  In other words, its for self defense.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	I've read a little bit of it.<br>  <br>  My impression: It's alright.

Plus some people just don't want to get married and have kids.<br>  <br>  Edit: I can not believe some people would assume he is ugly or gay or greedy!<br>  Women can be greedy too. They are the ones who go for guys who have good jobs. <br>  Even if a guy is ugly and he has a good job, then a lot of girls would want him because they are the greedy ones and just want to use him<br>  I'm speaking the truth people<br>  <br>  As a note to the asker, I don't assume a guy is ugly because he is not married and doesn't have kids. There is more to life than that and it's a personal choice. Some people dont want to get married, who cares? Or have kids. <br>  I am a 20 yr old woman and I have no intentions of getting married before I;m 30. I want to have a good job before I settle down.. That is IF I settle down.

8I9uduIiaa	I have to correct earlier answers:<br>  <br>  The NT was ***not*** 'written by jews'!!!<br>  <br>  By the time it was compiled, Christianity was an entirely NON Jewish faith. <br>  <br>  And the Church cannot tell us who wrote each Gospel; authorship was assigned.<br>  <br>  No Jew wrote the NT - the beliefs in it violate Judaism and Torah. A Jew who becomes a Christian is a CHRISTIAN, period.<br>  <br>  To answer the question:<br>  <br>  It's not all of the NT. There are some parts of it which, yes, ARE anti Jewish in sentiment. The Christians knew they would be living under Roman rule for some time; no way could they blame the Romans for the death of Jesus even though it was the ROMANS which charged him, tried him and crucified him. So the blame got shifted onto the Jews - an already despised and powerless community.<br>  <br>  Crucifixion was a purely Roman manner of murder. It was banned in Judaism, from the start.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that the early Church stated that it was the 'new israel' and that it was 'replacing' the Jews. The Christians petitioned Rome for separate status from the Jews, very early on. The Church viewed Judaism as a competitor at the start - yet another reason for some of the negative sentiment.<br>  <br>  For more on this: <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|gkdccYQoaa	Why are you preaching lies ? Is this what your teachers of the law have taught you? But haven't you learned, that God says "Do not bear false witness"?.Your question shows a lot about you and your fellow people's character.Just to tell you this is what is written in the Torah. 9:26 Nehemiah says "We killed the prophets".God tells Ezekiel the prophet that HE is going to send him to a nation of rebels.(Israel)<br>  <br>  Moses says to the Israelities you have been stiff necked as long as I have known you & after I die you are going to become even worse. When Moses did not come down from Sinai the Israelities wanted to make a golden calf but when the elders rebuked them they killed the elders and Aaron gives in to them saying "they have killed the elders they are going to kill me next" Isaiah says to Jerusalem "It is a city full of murderers".<br>  <br>  Isaiah says  "Israel's watchmen are blind,they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep.They are dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough.They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, each seeks his own gain." <br>  <br>  Again Isaiah is quoted saying  "But you—come here, you sons of a sorceress,you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes! Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?" <br>  <br>  Now does  the TORAH and the TALMUD preach so much HATRED  about the JEWS? No Doubt, it describes them accurately.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	It was a matter of survival.   When Paul invented Christianity, by turning the Orthodox Jew, Jesus of Nazareth, into the false Christian Messiah/God...it was necessary to distance the new religion from the OLD, MONOTHEISTIC religion that  could not tolerate any 'division' or 'partnering' with the TRUE and ONLY G-d. <br>  The idea of 'three persons in one god', was totally anathema to Orthodox Jews...so Paul needed to go to the Gentiles (read Pagans) to find followers for his new cult. <br>  <br>  Following in Paul's footsteps, the anonymous authors of the New Testament needed to set up a scape goat to answer for the death of their "Messiah".  It was unthinkable to accuse the powerful Romans, so the Jews were made to take the blame...and they became for the next two thousand years "Christ killers"...the murderers of the Christian God.  The moment the line "his blood be upon us and upon our children" was written, it became almost a duty for Christians to exterminate Jews for their imagined 'deicide'. <br>  <br>  It was John's Gospel that really set the scene for the centuries of Anti-Semitism that ruled  (and still rears it's ugly head in) Christianity.|`|c6407b5d6f4fea13316e9ab4178c5586aa	Let's see, ummm Jesus was a Jew, Peter was a Jew, John, Andrew, Simon, Timothy, and James were all Jews.

533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Fashion/modeling, beauty, dance, sounds like a good template for a  Goddess of the Arts. <br>  <br>  Aria: Goddess of Inspiration/Intuition. The blessed wind that allows the leap from thought to action. She is always portrayed in motion, her clothes in a constant whirl, for she leaps from moment to moment, person to person. Because she remains perpetually, beautifully, in motion, she is also a patron of all forms of dance.<br>  <br>  Her colors are sky blue, electric blue, silver and white. In her darker aspects, she can be clothed in grey or even dark purple, since even a fair wind and a clear sky can turn stormy.<br>  <br>  She was not born so much as she was the collective creation/result of all the Gods and Goddesses in attendance. After coming to power, the Gods did not know what to do amongst themselves, so they grew irritable and quarrelsome. Something needed to be done but no one knew for sure what it was. Out of that collective need arose Aria, appearing like blue lightning amongst them. The force of her presence blew away the clouds of discord that had fallen over the Gods, so each in turn offered her a place of honor besides them. She refused them all, saying she belonged neither to the Gods nor to their creations but to Creation itself, and thus could not be commanded, only invited. This is why there is always an extra seat painted whenever the Gods are portrayed, for she can only be invited to attend.<br>  <br>  Just a suggestion.|`|rh5vbol9aa	You may choose Cybele.|`|3StMurF2aa	How about a goddess who can distort the time/space continuum with mystical dances?

I worked for a psychologist for several years and the amount of people trying to get mental disability was outrageous.  Once it was awarded then they would bring their children, including infants, in and try to get money for them as well.  Until it's under control, which will probably never happen, then the people that really need it won't get it but the lazy people will.  Unfortunately there's a lot of unscrupulous doctors out there that are willing to sign off on anything if it gets the patient out of their hair.|`|AA10969163	Good question. Firstly, I am so sorry that you're going through this. Secondly, the government is more concerned about the financial security of the country than  it's people. Giving away billions of dollars for corporate bailouts and they can't put you on these programs? I don't understand that. Insurance companies are also capitalists, they don't care about individuals, like yourself, they just don't want to shell out anymore money than they HAVE to. It's a shame. You should move to Canada or the UK. At least you would get free medical.

283tO9j9aa	I think Barbies are another reason why little girls think it's normal to be a hypersexual airhead, but they're not the main reason. Kids know a doll is just a toy, they know not everyone can or wants to look like Barbie. However, growing up and watching all these "I'll be a virgin until I marry my true love" popstars on TV who gyrate and pant and walk around half naked can screw you up pretty bad. When I was a kid I was too busy reading books and getting dirty to care about stuff like that, but it starts so early now that i see 12 year olds in ridiculous outfits talking about all kinds of banal Paris Hilton crap.<br>  <br>  Yes, Hollywood is to blame. Today's pop culture is about being thin, blonde and orange and if you don't look like that you can never be cool. I think it's disgusting, and I'm at the higher end of the age group this crap is aimed at- don't forget that it's women in their late teens and early twenties that are perpetuating this by allowing themselves to fall for it, and the fashion/music/everything industry is encouraging us to be stupid as well as fake.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	No I have never thought Barbie was to blame....Hollywood is the main reason why girls try to go on all these crash diets.

This would make anyone feel better IMHO.<br>  <br>  Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, <br>  and remember what peace there may be in silence. <br>  <br>  As far as possible, without surrender, <br>  be on good terms with all persons. <br>  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; <br>  and listen to others, <br>  even to the dull and the ignorant; <br>  they too have their story. <br>  Avoid loud and aggressive persons; <br>  they are vexatious to the spirit. <br>  <br>  If you compare yourself with others, <br>  you may become vain or bitter, <br>  for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. <br>  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. <br>  Keep interested in your own career, however humble; <br>  it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. <br>  <br>  Exercise caution in your business affairs, <br>  for the world is full of trickery. <br>  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; <br>  many persons strive for high ideals, <br>  and everywhere life is full of heroism. <br>  Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. <br>  Neither be cynical about love, <br>  for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, <br>  it is as perennial as the grass. <br>  <br>  Take kindly the counsel of the years, <br>  gracefully surrendering the things of youth. <br>  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. <br>  But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. <br>  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. <br>  <br>  Beyond a wholesome discipline, <br>  be gentle with yourself. <br>  You are a child of the universe <br>  no less than the trees and the stars; <br>  you have a right to be here. <br>  And whether or not it is clear to you, <br>  no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>  <br>  Therefore be at peace with God, <br>  whatever you conceive Him to be. <br>  And whatever your labors and aspirations, <br>  in the noisy confusion of life, <br>  keep peace in your soul. <br>  <br>  <br>  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, <br>  it is still a beautiful world. <br>  Be cheerful.

H8WqMK1eaa	Actually, a goat wasn't the only problem. :)<br>  <br>  “Narrated by Hazrat ā’ishah that ayat-e-Rajm and ayat Raza’at were revealed, they were written on something. I kept them under the cart, meanwhile the holy prophet died and we became busy and one GOAT came and ATE those ayyat” (Ibn-e-Maja).   <br>  <br>  From al-Tabari, p.1523: “The only fault I ever found in ‘ā’ishah is that, when I was kneading my dough and ordered her to watch it, she fell asleep over it, and the pet sheep (or a goat) came and ate it.”  <br>  <br>  Narrated Ash-Shaibani:  I asked 'Abdullah bin Abi 'Aufa about the Rajam (stoning somebody to death for committing illegal sexual intercourse). He replied, "The Prophet carried out the penalty of Rajam," I asked, "Was that before or after the revelation of Surat-an-Nur?" He replied, "I do not know." <br>  <br>  “We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it: "If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust". (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 2, p.501).<br>  <br>  Bukhari: vol. 6, hadith 510, pp. 478-479; book 61 Narrated Anas bin Malik: Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur'an, so he said to 'Uthman, "O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Quran) ..." So 'Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you." Hafsa sent it to 'Uthman. 'Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, 'Abdullah bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and 'AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. 'Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their tongue." They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. ..." <br>  <br>  Bukhari: vol. 6, hadith 514, p. 482; book 61<br>  Narrated Umar bin Al-Khattab: I heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle and I listen to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah's Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, "Who taught you this Surat which I heard you reciting ?" He replied, "Allah's Apostle taught it to me". I said, "You have told a lie, for Allah's Apostle taught it to me in a different way from yours". So I dragged him to Allah's Apostle and said, "I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven't taught me!". On that Allah's Apostle said, "Release him (Umar) recite, O Hisham!" Then he recited in the same way I heard him reciting. Then Allah's Apostle said, "It was revealed in this way", and added, "Recite, O Umar", I recited it as he had taught me. Allah's Apostle then said, "It was revealed in this way. This Qur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever is easier for you."|`|AA10248239	If this were true, it wouldn't matter, because the Qur'an was preserved in the living memory of about a hundred of people who learned it from Prophet Muhammad, God bless him and grant him peace.|`|MirV9kSsaa	loooooooooool<br>  is it a kaffir now?|`|IxoBFCpTaa	?

3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	You have to believe God's word, which teaches if you confess your sin to Him, He has not only forgiven you, He has put that sin as far away from you as the east is from the west, and He will remember it no more.  Ask God to order your life, and your thoughts, about these things, from here on in.<br>  <br>  Appropriate that promise for yourself this minute.  If satan desires to throw that in your face by bringing it up, remember that you serve a merciful God who has forgiven you and cleansed you by the blood His son shed on Calvary.<br>  <br>  But oh....where is satan going to end up?  Oh yes, the lake of fire.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I don't understand why kissing a girl is a sin.

Seriously.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Read Luke, John, Romans, and Galatians.<br>  <br>  <br>  In 1 and 2Corinthians it talks about a man who was sleeping with his step-mother, and even he was forgiven by God's grace.

Forgive yourself|`|V0oc22ryaa	I forgive you, the bible says: " go to all the world taking the good news that Jesus Christ forgives and saves and whosoever you forgive they shall be forgiven and whosever you shall not forgive, they shall not be forgiven", if you have already asked God to forgive you He does and if you ask Him agian in 5 minutes He knows not what in the world you are talking about because He forgives and forgets. <br>  <br>  St John 20:23<br>  <a href="http://bible.cc/john/20-23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bible.cc/john/20-23.htm</a><br>  <br>  Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:<br>  <br>  Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesus’s sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen|`|naI5hGjHaa	You are forgiven.

Jesus came and died for our sins, and rose again  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)
xyt9NdjVaa	It depends on the circumstances surrounding you and this person, also the content of the letter. <br>  <br>  You might consider asking yourself: <br>  What good will come of of my letter? <br>  Will the letter have a positive or negative impact on the person I am leaving this to? <br>  <br>  If leaving a letter for them will truly serve a  good and meaningful purpose, fine, if not, I would reconsider.|`|HxbEnNLQaa	if they won't read it now,then why do you think they will read it then?  Write a letter to someone it will be meaningful NOW while it counts to all concerned.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	Wouldn't it be better to write the letter now or even phone her"<br>  <br>  Good or bad, it is always good to let them reply. The letter good cause guilt on her part.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	Definitely Yes!  It will serve as a comfort to you because something needs to be gotten out in the open between you and this person.|`|6ozmjp3xaa	Yes write it, but don't send it, read it often and rewrite as many times as you feel|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Yes.<br>  I have<br>  To be sent after my death and to the person only.<br>  So yes write the letter and keep it close.|`|AA11296212	Death has the last word anyhow.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	How do you know that they wouldn't read it now?|`|GOaDQuhlaa	well, It might be the only way you can say what you need too. I think it would be a good idea. Just make sure it can be a private thing though.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	It depends on what you want to say.  If you wouldn't say it to them while you're living, you probably shouldn't from the grave, either.|`|y7HD8unTaa	Oh yes.  Do it now.  Then stash it in a drawer to be delivered upon your death.  Don't send it until you sleep on it a day or two.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Yes I feel you should positive or negative it's apparently very important to you|`|k9A8mP30aa	No.|`|e747c2c4f42307a0319a41df54a314d0aa	depends what u want to say-need more info to form opinion.|`|FcZU29W6aa	No, I don't think you should.  It would sort of be like trying to control things from the grave!!!<br>  <br>  However, I do think you should try to mend this fence before it's too late.  Good luck to you.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Only if it is a kind letter and not one that is berating them from beyond the grave!|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	It depends on what you have to say.  Why can't you talk to the person now?  Why does this have to wait until after you die when the reader cannot ask you questions??  My uncle did that to his son (my cousin)--told my cousin he was adopted and my cousin had no one to talk to about it or ask all the questions that kind of information would give rise to.  We did our best to assure my cousin we love him no matter what but we couldn't answer any of the questions he had since we hadn't been privy to that stuff.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd prefer to hear it directly from the living person.  But if that person is just too damn chicken to face me, then a letter would be better then keeping me ignorant.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	If they don't care now I doubt that they will care after you are gone. If you are looking to have the last word I would plan on being the last person, and that is not likely. Maybe you will be able to return and haunt them. If we can leave a subliminal message it might be an opportunity to enjoy having the last word.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	It is in your thoughts now, and it must be important to you , so yes. . . go ahead and write it, and keep it with your will.|`|KWwW7N49aa	If you feel  led to, then by all means do it. I hope it is a nice letter.
AA10148570	In your situation, the most reliable thing to do is to track down your sister or the teacher whose student or students danced to the piece, and ask what song it was. There is also a possibility that the name of the song would be in the program from the recital.

jiMAtaCraa	Indians have Bollywood. Case disclosed.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	lol<br>  <br>  I thought Hispanics were brown people!<br>  <br>  Well, to answer your question, I doubt most white people would not care if Indians "took over Hollywood" because it seems like all the Indian actors look white anyways.<br>  <br>  First of all, you should have read my answer before you commented. Everybody knows Indians come in every shade, but almost all of the Bollywood actors can easily pass as a white person from Northern Europe.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	LOL. Nope, Indians have Bollywood, which is making way much more money then Hollywood, so why the hell would they want to do that? They probably produce three times the films, then Hollywood does.|`|pfke6Jieaa	indians control the media too. they have bollywood. and there are many americans and indians in movies together. remember bride and prejudice? it was about an indian woman marrying an american man. but bollywood does a crappy job, no offense, in presenting indian people. they have the same mindset as hollywood.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I think for the most part Indians are unthreatening and generally liked by the white man. I dont see why not.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	No, the Jews own Hollywood.|`|qSqs7PoCaa	Take over? I wouldn't state it as "to take over" but yeah, what's wrong with more East indian actors/actresses in Hollywood? I wouldn't mind.<br>  And what do you mean with "the jews have taken over Hollywood"? I didn't even notice that.|`|4eKo5nxkaa	Jews didnt take over Hollywood.  They made Hollywood.<br>  <br>  Indians have Bollywood.|`|MV4QN2maaa	Every kind of person from everywhere is in Hollywood, it doesn't belong to anybody.
NmsBFeNJaa	Okay. This is a delicate situation because it is not classy to tell people or include a registry in your invitations. The  smart way is to register at the stores that you want(and it is good to register at more than one as long as you don't repeat items). Then you make sure that the parents and all members of the bridal party know where you are registered. People will either give you money  as a gift or they will ask parents/bridal party members what you need. They may also ask you when they RSVP. You will most likely get more money than anything else.|`|EDiJe38Taa	If you have a bridal shower, your host can inform the people where you are registered. Or if they ask you, you may tell them. You do NOT put it on your wedding invitation. Usually you get gifts at your shower. If you do not have a shower, people will bring it to the wedding. You can do more than one store but that seems kind of greedy. It is also not uncommon these days to have a wedding website set up to let your guests know about you and the details of your wedding. You can include registry info there.|`|43605721027975b12e4f12cd01c1e7d3aa	If someone asks you where you're registered, it's perfectly fine to tell them! Otherwise, it's best to get your family and bridal family to spread it. Typically, you recieve gifts at the bridal shower(s), and at the wedding. There's usually a table that someone will set up for gifts and a locked box for cards with cash/cheques in them. (We got about $7000!) Sometimes people will bring the gifts to your home before or after the wedding.<br>  <br>  My husband and I registered at 3 different stores. It's not greedy at all- it gives people different price points and different options.
0aN1xIxfaa	The Bible answers your question. In 1 Peter 1:10-12 it says:<br>  "Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things."<br>  <br>  The key point is searching carefully and intently, desiring to know God's mind on matters. Then the Holy Spirit reveals more. But if someone dismisses scripture parts that don't seem to make sense to them, saying, "Oh, that's not logical", they need not expect the Spirit of Christ to help them. Unfortunately, millions of people take that attitude to the Trinity and teaching about Jesus' return to earth. They will forever remain ignorant of what those things means until they intently seek God's revelation. Jesus promised that after He returned to heaven, He would send the Holy Spirit, to guide believers into all truth. Those who do not have the Holy Spirit's anointing cannot possibly understand the deep things of God.<br>  <br>  One thing we will discover in the glory - the prophets of old knew far more than we think they knew! We have a hint of that with Job who declared, "I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes." (Job 19:25-26) There is your Old Testament clue about the deity of Christ! But your eyes have to be open to see it!|`|FD8I4zthaa	The trinity was a later invention. As was most Christian Doctrine. (All divinely inspired of course!)|`|VncSMLMpaa	Absolutely right. Even in the New Testament, not long after the ascension of Jesus, we are told that people were trying to pervert the truth by adding gnostic and other ideas.<br>  <br>  This is just another set of examples of church and theological spin or worse. We should teach the truth of Scripture otherwise what is the point. Human wisdom just leads to a dead end.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	edited<br>  <br>  The last Prophet of God was John the Baptist...<br>  <br>   The Revelation concerning the Rapture is revealed in The New Testament(the "word" rapture in not used in the Bible, but the description is there.)... after the death of The Last Prophet.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Trinity is The Father, The Son, The Holy Spirit... that makes 3... that is The Trinity... just that simple... nothing more to it.<br>  <br>  All of the Prophets knew The Word of God... but they were commissioned to disseminate specifically what NEW Revelations they were given... they had no need ot rewrite what had already been given.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	They always knew that GOD was spirit, not physical in nature.<br>  They knew GOD would send a Messiah, a new Moses, David's heir.<br>  Jesus referred to himself as Son of Man, & GOD as his Father.<br>  Even Jesus said there was much more to tell his disciples,<br>  but that the Spirit would reveal everything to them in due time.|`|NjSWQFBYaa	"Plurality in the Godhead"<br>  The following group of scriptures strongly suggests a plurality within the Godhead. These verses are translated correctly in the Jehovah's Witness Bible so you can encourage them to use it. The NIV is not as literal in its translation in the Amos verses, so I recommend using either the King James or the New American Standard Bible when doing your own.<br>  <br>  1) Gen. 1:26, "Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness . . . "<br>  <br>  They will say that angels are the ones who helped God make man. However, there is no scriptural evidence for that. God is the only creator. <br>  <br>  You can also take him to Col. 1:15-17 where it says that Jesus is the creator of all things--including man. <br>  <br>  2) Gen. 19:24, "Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven."<br>  <br>  Is this saying there are two Lords, two Jehovah's? <br>  <br>  3) Amos 4:10-11, "?'I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, and I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; yet you have not returned to Me,' declares the LORD. ?'I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah . . . '"<br>  <br>  Jehovah is the one talking and He says, "I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah..." Very interesting. <br>  <br>  4)  Isaiah 44:6, "Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: ?'I am the first and I am the last, and there is no God besides me . . . '" See also, Isaiah 48:1 <br>  <br>  These verses and others are more fully developed in "The Plurality Study" (first link, below).<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	As the Apostle Paul said, prophets only prophesied "in part". This implies that [each individual] prophet was not told everything; he was just told what God believed that people needed to know for that time period.<br>  <br>  You might want to look up the concept of "progressive revelation".<br>  <br>  --------------------------<br>  Progressive revelation in Christianity is the concept that the sections of the Bible that were written later contain a fuller revelation of God compared to the earlier sections.<br>  <br>  For instance, the theologian Charles Hodge wrote, "The progressive character of divine revelation is recognized in relation to all the great doctrines of the Bible. .. What at first is only obscurely intimated is gradually unfolded in subsequent parts of the sacred volume, until the truth is revealed in its fulness." <br>  <br>  The ultimate revelation of God is understood to be found in Jesus Christ as revealed in the Gospels. Hence according to this idea, the New Testament should be used to understand and interpret the Old Testament, even though all sections of the bible are believed to be accurate according to conservative theology.<br>  <br>  The notion of progressive revelation is not shared by the Roman Catholic Church and by Eastern Orthodoxy, who instead favor the idea of tradition and development of doctrine, while progressivist and continuationist approaches are specifically condemned in the declaration Dominus Iesus.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	they were all told about the events to come in portions that are suitable for their mission<br>  <br>  but there are major events that all prophets knew specially the high level prophets<br>  <br>  these events were told by all prophets to their people<br>  <br>  the resurrection and judgment and final abode is mentioned by all prophets in one way or another and is clear<br>  <br>  the details were lost in the original words that they were revealed in<br>  translations and the hand of man lost few more<br>  intentions of hiding lost few more<br>  <br>  but traces are the and can be found for the truth seekers<br>  <br>  as for the trinity Jesus never talked about it, why do you expect previous prophets to talk about it.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	Which prophets are you referring to?  And the Son and the Paraclete are written as fulfillment of prophesy.  I have only heard Baptists and Fundies refer to the "rapture"|`|95be5639aed6aa784e4750dbb0a7e356aa	It's called "progressive revelation". More information was given as time went on. For example, there was no concept of the Messiah suffering and dying until Isaiah.|`|bCIpOU6taa	What's rapture/trinity?<br>  The whole God spirit/man/i forgot the other thing?|`|1sSmCaHZaa	so there is a trinity then ?|`|juJv9K4Daa	You need to understand what the truth is.  The truth is Jesus Christ.|`|koynaDYbaa	Because maybe the Trinity etc. isn't true. They don't believe in it maybe!!!<br>  <br>  If Jesus was God who did he pray to?|`|WeIcJ1CNaa	first off they were told about heaven or hell they always proclaim repent. Prophets prophesised things about their<br>   time mainly and the understanding about future prophesy wasnt given to them because it was for us to understand. Prophets don't have all truth but that which is given to them. The rapture is mans understanding don't forget in bible when man has ever tried to think for themselves they have made a fool of themselves but when they asked God they didn't.You ask questions which to be honest have a very easy good answer and can be explained with little thoughts. If you really want to know for yourselfs like its been said by prophets dont look for man for understanding but God.<br>  <br>  This might offend you but jehovah witnesses are following lies. If you want real truth stop thinking for yourself and looking for people for answers. There is one solid way for truth and its written plainly. Just pray not 5 minutes or so on but really pray for truth as God gives truth to those who want it

But of course I was nervous around her, like I couldn't speak real words. I was in Spanish class and me and my best friend were talking and laughing with the people around us, and I noticed her looking at me so I worked up the courage to stare back. But I smiled and waved at her too. She just grinned and waved back. I've waved at her like one other time, but we've always had this secret friendship of catching each others eyes, and smiling. I still can't make complete sentences around her, and I can't control the volume of my voice either :(  lol. She's a year older than me :)<br>  <br>  ANYWAY ON TO YOUR QUESTION!<br>  Just try and smile at him, like I did. Mabye after that he will talk to you and you guys could become friends.

T4rGYaKYaa	The Most Concise Definition of God:<br>  The most concise definition of God in Islam is given in the four verses of Surah Ikhlas which is Chapter 112 of the Qur’an:<br>  <br>  "Say: He is Allah,<br>  The One and Only.<br>  "Allah, the Eternal, Absolute.<br>  "He begets not, nor is He begotten.<br>  And there is none like unto Him."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 112:1-4]<br>  <br>  The word ‘Assamad’ is difficult to translate. It means ‘absolute existence’, which can be attributed only to Allah (swt), all other existence being temporal or conditional. It also means that Allah (swt) is not dependant on any person or thing, but all persons and things are dependant on Him.<br>  <br>  last line is most important --In Islam, God is believed to be the only real supreme being, all-powerful and all knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe[1][2] Islam puts a heavy emphasis on the conceptualization of God as strictly singular (tawhid).[3] God is unique (wahid) and inherently one (ahad), all-merciful and omnipotent.[4] According to the Qur'an there are 99 Names of God (al-asma al-husna lit. meaning: "The best names") each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of God.[5][6] All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.[7] Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are "the Compassionate" (al-rahman) and "the Merciful" (al-rahim).[5][6]<br>  <br>  Creation and ordering of the universe is seen as an act of prime mercy for which all creatures sing God's glories and bear witness to God's unity and lordship. According to the Islamic teachings, God exists without a place.[8] According to the Qur'an, "No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. God is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things" (Qur'an 6:103)[2]<br>  <br>  God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal God: According to the Qur'an, God is nearer to person than person's jugular vein. God responds to those in need or distress whenever they call. Above all, God guides humanity to the right way, “the holy way§.”[8]<br>  <br>  Islam teaches that Allah is the same god worshiped by the members of other Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Judaism (29:46).[9]<br>  <br>  The word for total surrender, submission, obedience, purity of heart and peace in the Arabic language is "Islam". Those who try to perform these actions are called "MU-slims" [Islam-ERs]. <br>  <br>  To a Muslim the whole purpose of life is "ibadah" or worship to the One True Almighty God on Terms and under His Conditions there is a wonderful    article   here  <br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/398/57/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a>|`|AA12156048	Allah is Arabic interpreted into the grand language English as "the ultimate supreme being God",the meaning to your life is to live life as quantum theory predicts, ultimate continuous chaos,its from the way you live that you are at peace and in luxury to bring order to chaos and according to you works,Do everything to the deserved as if you was doing it for yourself,then you will have the self realization you seek.|`|0puMsQJgaa	Simple Answer!<br>  <br>  Research Allah on these Internet Sites and find out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_emp..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_emp...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rush..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rush...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islam-watch.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-watch.org/</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.former-muslims.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.former-muslims.com/</a><br>  <br>  You will NOT Believe what you read, as the TRUTH is always shocking!<br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking!

No church is required to donate to charity to create "intangible religious benefits." <br>  <br>  It seems you wish to penalize the church because the staff has what you consider high salaries ... I guess you are suggesting that the church is taking a profit and giving that profit to its employees ... in that case, rest easier; the employees, including pastors, are paying personal income tax to the U.S., state and city, and maybe county and school district, on those salaries.  Also the church, as employer, is paying social security and medicare taxes.  It is only the corporate income that is not taxed.  <br>  <br>  If your pastors are not paying income tax, then they are breaking the law and you can report them (as individuals) to the IRS, state and local tax authorities.

8f1i9DWyaa	Human reasonings - what makes sense to the human mind - do not necessarily reflect Truth. Jesus said, "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life." We do not need many paths. We need a person, a unique person that was Son of Man and at the same time Son of God. Jesus is King of all Creation. There can only be one king who reigns supreme. Jesus is pre-eminent. I do not have a religion, I have a person who loves me, a King who carried a cross & was beaten for my sins so that I do not have to be punished. I have a Lover of my soul who allowed wicked people to nail Him to a cross where He shed His blood and died of heartbreak. All this suffering  because mankind is wicked, the wickedness is in our DNA, and mankind needed to be redeemed from their sins, needed to be washed clean from sin. We don't need paths, even many paths. We need Father God's salvation. We need a Redeemer, a Savior, a Lord and a King who loves us enough to die for us. This so that we can go to heaven, to paradise and be in His loving presence. Jesus wants to take you to His Father, God. Jesus wants to take you to The Father's House. You cannot get in any other way but through believing in Jesus. His Father God's name is not allah. Repent of your sins, believe in Jesus as your Savior, receive His love, seek His face. Believe in Jesus and take Him for your Savior.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	The Bible is a compilation of many Books.|`|4293cf50016bde6c1a79ccb90dbe6c96aa	Not if they contradict.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	My son has Thomas the Tank Engine.

One of these contributions concerned the philosophical problem of evil. Up until St. Augustine's time, philosophers questioned the idea proposed by Christians that evil generated in a world created by a perfectly good God. The problem is easy enough to understand, yet slightly more complicated to solve. St. Augustine raised some fairly good propositions to offer an explanation for this question. <br>  <br>  Origen - His writings represent one of the first serious intellectual attempts to articulate and defend Christianity.

f3nwI8ytaa	This is a really good question.  And the answer is no.  The bible as we know it was not assembled until centuries after the last book in it was written.  The various books were used by the Church from their composition, but they were not assembled into a single book until the council of Nicaea in 325.  Those who apply John's warning to the bible are actually misinterpreting it.  John was speaking only of the Apocalypse when he said that.  The Church closed the canon.  That's the authority behind the injunction against adding to it.  (sorry fellow Protestants, but it's true)<br>  <br>  peace|`|WjRqYf6naa	The verse in question refers only to the Book of Revelation.

Only to come here and see all the young knuckleheads who are so ignorant beyond belief they are a disgrace to all that was once great. I'd be the same dam way. I'd be like, "those aren't my people".

People can't multiply if they don't have an argument of how is or was man made/Please tell me.I know how but I'd like you to tell me how man came alive.Don't tell me a skeleton or lame answer either.BY the way I looked and there is no actual proof saying that religion causes mental illness|`|cpOtr6Thaa	It's OK not to like us or agree with us, but is it fair to say that people of different faiths than you are mentally insane?  <br>  <br>  Tolerance: a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, practices, race, religion, nationality, etc., differ from one's own; freedom from bigotry.<br>  <br>  Bigotry: stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one's own.|`|f14e805e22b702d7c1124090d0de2220aa	It's not just Christians that pray to a god that you can't see touch or hear... so if you're willing to put 95% of the human race in a mental institution for believing in god... good luck my friend.|`|cWaS1Bjqaa	not unless your willing to institutionalize every other religion, which would amount to millions of people.

Your not going to find 100% empirical evidence for God's existence. That would cancel out faith and without faith it is impossible to please God.

Science bases itself only on #1.   We base our court system and our everyday life on #2.<br>  <br>  I can present proof of variety #2 that God exists.    Look at the date on your money.   Whose age is that?     The United States of America presents authoritative proof that Jesus existed and that he is a king.    (Dates on coinage are based on the years of the reign of a king.)    Your coins also say, "In God We Trust."<br>  <br>  There's your proof.<br>  <br>  Whether you accept the proof is a different matter.<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Canadian coins still have Jesus' age.    While they may Queen Elizabeth's picture on them, the date is still years since the reign of a king, not necessarily the one on the obverse.   Mint tradition.   Like Canada, USA coins have pictures of different presidents or people.   <br>  <br>  So you still have your proof.   The authority of Canada says Jesus is a king as well.|`|83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	Wow,  that's kind of the point- using the bible.  It's like asking someone to take a walk without legs.<br>  <br>  But, that's kind of the problem isn't it?   The faith is based on teachings, and the teachings are found in the bible.<br>  <br>  The followers of the faith are not required to possess external feelings of confirmation, or have physical evidence of God to believe in him.<br>  <br>  It's pretty much the core of the faith.  Your request is not possible as the bible is needed to know God, and no external proof past the bible is required.<br>  <br>  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to just nod my head and agree with whatever book someone sticks under my nose- especially after 2 thousand years of zealots have been at it- but that's beside the point.<br>  <br>  I am just pointing out that the two concepts are inseparable as far as the Christian religion goes.   <br>  <br>  If this posting is really a statement that there IS no proof outside the bible- then I guess you have no problem with the logic of your question.<br>  <br>  Best regards.<br>  <br>  Edit: hehehe.  If you had prosthetics, then you would HAVE legs, and you would be asking someone with legs to walk.. .. just like if you were allowed to use the bible, you could find your proof.   Come on now.|`|oqOjz7Dxaa	Well, while I could bore you with Aquinas' 5 ways to prove the existence of God (which I'm sure you can look up yourself! Too long to type) I'm sure I can't. :P<br>  There's also the Ontological argument, but I hate that fricking argument.<br>  The Paley's Watch analogy: say we come across a watch in a forest, just lying on the ground. All of the parts of the watch are working in perfect symbiosis. If just one of the pieces was formed slightly differently, or removed, the watch would not work. We do not suppose that the watch came to be a watch by accident, we assume that someone must have designed the watch and put it there. Now if we compare the watch with the world and the whole laws of Physics, working in perfect symbiosis to allow life with all its beauty to flourish. Someone must have designed all this, and put it there. :D<br>  Will that do? :P

I wish that there were more private stalls but if there are not I either wait or use the bathroom. In high school I used the bathroom I was surprised that no one else did. A bit of modesty is never a bad thing in my opinion! It's uncomfortable when I'm going to my locker and totally naked people start talking to me.|`|oKbjeKktaa	I usually laugh with my boys. It is diturbing, but when we make it into a joke, it doesn't bother us anymore. I never just let my stuff hang. The only time i ever got nude in a locker room, was when me and my boys were in the same area and some random guy comes in and uses the locker next to mine. Mind you the locker room was empty. So he was sitting on the bench and i just removed my towel (wet from the pool) and bend down in fron of his face twice because he annoyed me. LOL|`|Q1EtcCb7aa	def a private stall. that's creepy when strangers are staring at your body.

You still get a sentence even though you did the right thing.<br>  This is what is wrong with society!!! They think "LAWS" are what is right and wrong. They are wrong.<br>  If i get attacked, i am rightfully entitled to killing the attacker.<br>  If i get robbed, i may stop the robber in ANY way i choose correct.<br>  People who do not rightfully kill are not entitled to any rights. They should be legally allowed to be killed by anybody.|`|9e7f34ca42b0bc7a01f44825b1539e5eaa	I couldn't agree more with everything in that whole statement . The system is completely screwed up .<br>  <br>  I was watching this show on the criminal investigation channel last night about people in jail who had life sentences for rape and murder . And the host of the show was trying to make the viewers feel sympathetic towards the jail inmates because he thought they had learned their lessons. I was so disgusted with that host, how dare he portray the killer/rapist as the victim . And then he even had the nerve to say that the way all of the prisoners get treated in jail is bad because they have to do hard labor during the day so they hurt their backs, totally disregarding the pain all of their victims went through.  it's like what the hell do you expect jail is, a holiday in a hotel . I couldn't help but think to myself this idiot host is feeling sorry for these scumbags, but if it was his daughter that they raped and murdered, maybe he wouldn't be so soft hearted towards them. <br>  <br>  And when I read about that sicko who beheaded the man on the bus that he got away with it . Basically anyone who commits a crime like that is mentally ill and un predictable, that's even more reason to lock them up in jail so they can't re offend , not put them in a mental ward only to let them out years later .<br>  <br>  And the fact that if someone trespasses onto your property and hurts themselves they can sue, that is just unbelievable isn't it . I mean what moron came up with that one. I heard a similar story where someone was trying to jump someones fence and broke there leg on the pool lol serves them right for trespassing on someone else's property. <br>  <br>  I believe in an eye for an eye , and that goes for people who hurt animals too. Whatever people do should get done the same back as punishment so they know exactly how it feels. Not a slap on the wrist and then they go do it again as soon as they get out of jail . It makes me sick .|`|VhzhZP8jaa	One name comes to mind. ACLU. oh, and don't forget to throw in the tort cases made by those greedy little sniveling trial lawyers.

UhAHaOWFaa	Mexico is a Catholic country so I would imagine the birth of Jesus is very important to them.|`|qZ23brcwaa	For mexican people? do you mean in general? or mexican people living in mexico? or in the US? you probably mean in mexico since i'm mexican, but i (like many other mexican-americans) have become pretty americanized so we have a traditional christmas mixed in with some mexican traditions lol. but that happens with lots of cultures and traditions and all.<br>  <br>  whats different from the traditional american christmas i suppose is the food. mexicans cook A LOT. its so exaggerated its really funny honestly. my mom cooks a lot, and when we have guests over, they bring so much food as well. apart from ham, and all that other i guess "traditional" food you could say, we have mexican foods, such as beans, rice, tamales maybe. some of my mexican friends really stick to mexican food and have pozole, tamales, tacos, lol but i guess thats mostly done in the US because my parents tell me how in mexico, christmas is celebrated quite differently.<br>  <br>  in mexico, they do have that theme of santa claus but what they (they as in mostly the children) look forward to is "los tres reyes" (the three kings/wise men, the ones who brought the gifts for jesus) you might want to research that. i'm sure you can easily find information if you just google it. <br>  <br>  also the weather is very nice in mexico so the children might break a pinata or something like that. they have some activities and its mostly a family/friends bonding thing.<br>  <br>  my parents grew up in mexico and both come from big families. they tell me all the time that we (we as in me and my siblings) are spoiled and all (lol) because they never had what we have now. they just want us to appreciate what they give us. most people in mexico dont live in luxury so its not really about the presents they receive. the children are mostly happy with whatever they get, be it an outfit or 1 or 2 toys. and if i remember correctly from what my parents have told me, they look more forward to the three kings day (which i'm not sure when that is, you might want to look it up) than actual christmas. and i think they also receive a gift on that day too.<br>  <br>  so i hope i got you somewhere with this answer i wrote. i tried my best. but to answer your question the most important part of xmas for mexican people >>>I<<< would say the food. because like i said most mexican families dont live in luxury and are sometimes pretty poor so on that special day, they might have food they normally dont have. also, just spending time with family and friends. <br>  <br>  oh and also what horrorfan said. most mexicans are catholic. so they go to mass in the morning and pray. most are religious so not sure about the *birth* of jesus since its debatable nowadays, but something  religious along those lines is also greatly considered. <br>  <br>  presents are nice, but its not all about that. (not too sound corny :P but yeah)|`|A8n4mRnzaa	Mexico's Christmas traditions are based on Mexico's form of Roman Catholicism and popular culture traditions also called posadas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople go from door to door in a fashion reminiscent of when the parents of unborn baby Jesus looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a gift-filled pi?ata.<br>  Mexican Christmas is not influenced by American Christmas since it is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas.<br>  In many Mexican places, children receive gifts not on Christmas but on January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men bring gifts not only to baby Jesus but also to children who have placed written requests in their shoes.<br>  At midnight on Christmas, millions of families place the figure of baby Jesus in their nacimientos (Nativity scenes), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole.<br>  Mexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the birthday of La Guadalupana (Virgin of Guadalupe), and end on January 6, with the Epiphany. Children usually do not attend school on this date; and, when they go to their rooms, they find not only the toys but also that the Three Magic Kings have appeared at El Nacimiento. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around Christmas time into what is known as the Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon.
HsT9sW5Xaa	Partially. <br>  <br>  Depending on the age of the kid, the child likely won't have much of a sense of personal responsibility. This means the parents are the ones who choose if Timmy gets a happy meal, or vegetable soup. <br>  <br>  The parent will be the one who ultimately decides the frequency of the child's meals, the type of food consumed during each meal, and exercising or arranged sports done by the child. Also, though it's not really the parent's fault, the parent could give the child genes which lower their metabolism - therefore making it impossibly hard to help them lose weight. Neglect and abuse from the parent can also result in eating problems for the kid i.e malnutrition which would lead to a lower metabolism.|`|9GoiqfHxaa	It is the parents fault for a kid being obese, because the child has no control over what type of food is in the house and does not know whether the food is bad for them or not, so they will eat whatever the parents buy for them to eat. <br>  <br>  Once they are old enough to know what is healthy, it becomes the child's fault as to whether they are obese or not, although the reason they usually stay that way is because the parents have not taught them healthier eating habits when they were younger, so they think that what they're eating is perfectly fine.
nQvcqVkNaa	I like the way you are going about this going about getting people to open their Bibles. Unfortunately, I seem to be among the very few willing to actually do that.<br>  <br>  sad<br>  <br>  Your approach has given me an idea though; so once again I will answer from the NASB and NWT to show that, contrary to all the JW haters propaganda, the NWT has no difference in meaning at all.<br>  <br>  John 20:17<br>  (NASB)Jesus said to her, "Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'"<br>  (NWT)Jesus said to her: “Stop clinging to me. For I have not yet ascended to the Father. But be on your way to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and YOUR Father and to my God and YOUR God.’”<br>  <br>  Jehovah (not himself) is the one Jesus calls God.<br>  <br>  John 17:3-5<br>  (NASB)"This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. "I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do. "Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.<br>  (NWT)This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ. 4?I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do. 5?So now you, Father, glorify me alongside yourself with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was.<br>  <br>  Jesus says we must come to know his God Jehovah in oreder to gain everlasting life.<br>  <br>  John 5:19<br>  (NASB)Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.<br>  (NWT)Therefore, in answer, Jesus went on to say to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, The Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he beholds the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.<br>  <br>  Jesus observed his Father Jehovah for eons before coming to earth and copies his Father perfectly<br>  <br>  John 14:28<br>  (NASB)You heard that I said to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you ' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.<br>  (NWT)YOU heard that I said to YOU, I am going away and I am coming [back] to YOU. If YOU loved me, YOU would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.<br>  <br>  I suppose if he were part of a trinity, he would have said the Father is equal to me. But he didn't.<br>  <br>  Mark 10:18<br>  (NASB)And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.<br>  (NWT)Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.<br>  <br>  Throughout the Scriptures, Jesus always gives the honor and glory to Jehovah.<br>  <br>  Matthew 26:39<br>  (NASB)And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will." <br>  (NWT)And going a little way forward, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”<br>  <br>  Again; always deferring to Jehovah. Never considering himself to be Jehovah's equal.<br>  <br>  John 8:17-18<br>  (NASB)"Even in your law it has been written that the testimony of two men is true. "I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me."<br>  (NWT)Also, in YOUR own Law it is written, ‘The witness of two men is true.’ 18?I am one that bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.” <br>  <br>  Jesus clearly states that he and his Father Jehovah are 2 separate beings.<br>  <br>  Mark 13:32<br>  (NASB)But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.<br>  (NWT)“Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father. <br>  <br>  Obviously, if they were equal parts of a three-in-one god then Jesus would have all the knowledge Jehovah has.<br>  <br>  Matthew 20:23<br>  (NASB)He said to them, "My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father." <br>  (NWT)He said to them: “YOU will indeed drink my cup, but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”<br>  <br>  If Jesus was co-equal with his Father Jehovah as the trinity says, then he would be co-decider in all matters.<br>  <br>  Matthew 3:17<br>  (NASB)and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased." <br>  (NWT)Look!

Jesus prayed alone because it was worth the intimacy with His Father. He could do nothing beyond what He prayed for. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mark 6:46 - see matthew 14:23<br>  <br>  <br>  Mark 14:32 Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit down here while I pray." <br>  <br>  - Jesus praying just before His arrest. He was in a garden where He took the cup of sin and drank from it, because in God's garden was where the first adam drank from sin's cup. Jesus, the last adam had no sin of His own and could therefore lift the burden and set it back down.<br>  <br>  <br>  Luke 6:13 - Jesus prayed a lot, an indication of ourselves.

The term is used also of similar celebrations in Old Catholic Churches, in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism, and in some largely High Church Lutheran regions, including the Scandinavian and Baltic countries. For the celebration of the Eucharist in Eastern Churches, including those in full communion with the Holy See, other terms, such as the Divine Liturgy, the Holy Qurbana, and the Badarak, are normally used. Most Western denominations not in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church, such as Calvinist Christianity, also usually prefer terms other than Mass.<br>  <br>  The term "Mass" is derived from the late-Latin word missa (dismissal), a word used in the concluding formula of Mass in Latin: "Ite, missa est" ("Go; it is the dismissal").|`|AA11008046	It sounds to me like you are putting on a front to please your boyfriend and get some kind of acceptance with the priest.<br>  Don`t do it!

Otherwise, the same behavior that is acceptible in your church is probably just fine at mass.  Welcome!|`|6jAVElX7aa	you dont have to kneel, I dont whenever I am in a catholic church and no people dont take it as an insult. we are only suppose to bow our knee to God and Christ Jesus whom He sent.|`|U51pBeLfaa	When in Rome do as the Romans do.

When you kneel, you are kneeling before God, and that is NEVER wrong.  To not kneel may be offensive to our Lord.  Realize that at a Mass you are worshipping our Lord Jesus Christ, you are doing MORE than just receiving scriptural instruction.  It may be a great turning point in your life.  I think you have a good boyfriend who truly cares for you!|`|bYDVTv7Maa	Just go.

Certainly we cannot depend upon it to choose our dates or mates!<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 18:10-12 (Contemporary English Version)<br>  10-11Don't sacrifice your son or daughter. And don't try to use any kind of magic or witchcraft to tell fortunes or to cast spells or to talk with spirits of the dead. 12The LORD is disgusted with anyone who does these things, and that's why he will help you destroy the nations that are in the land. <br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 4:19 (NIV)<br>  And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 47:13-14 (New International Version)<br>  <br>   13 All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! <br>         Let your astrologers come forward, <br>         those stargazers who make predictions month by month, <br>         let them save you from what is coming upon you. <br>  <br>   14 Surely they are like stubble; <br>         the fire will burn them up. <br>         They cannot even save themselves <br>         from the power of the flame. <br>         Here are no coals to warm anyone; <br>         here is no fire to sit by.<br>  <br>  15 That is all they can do for you— <br>         these you have labored with <br>         and trafficked with since childhood. <br>         Each of them goes on in his error; <br>         there is not one that can save you.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 10:2 (New International Version)<br>  2 This is what the LORD says: <br>         "Do not learn the ways of the nations <br>         or be terrified by signs in the sky, <br>         though the nations are terrified by them."<br>  <br>  However, I think you might learn about human personalities and quirks when you read descriptions of the sun signs.  You might gain insight into why a person acts or thinks a certain way--whether it relates to their astrological sign or not.  (This is my own opinion, not something I read in the Bible.)<br>  <br>  Although we're not allowed to follow astrology, that doesn't mean that astrology is totally invalid.  The Wise Men of Luke 2 were astrologers, and they used that knowledge to find and worship the Christ Child.  Jesus himself said, in Luke 21:25, ""There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars." I think the danger is that the spirits behind astrology might enslave us or make us terrified, and that's why we are to avoid it. <br>  <br>  BTW, the stars themselves are not evil.  There are plenty of positive references to stars in the Bible, including that WE will shine like stars!  (See Daniel 12 and Philippians 2.)  This is probably why we refer to our celebrities today as "stars".<br>  <br>  God is not going to let his choice of the right date or mate for you be hindered by her astrological sign.<br>  <br>  Also BTW, you don't have to go crazy about this.  I was born on December 21 and I'll say that I'm a Sagittarius, though I don't ascribe to astrology.  The Zodiac exists in astronomy, too.

I would say the 70's and 80's were the worst because of crack cocaine and other drug abuse, AIDS and other STDs, and a bad recession. Although we had the Y2K scare, 911, Bush, Hurricane Katrina, and recession levels at their worst since the 80's, it's not as bad as other decades where people had to fight for civil rights, lynchings, etc. You're right that the best part of this decade was technology.

There are mortals to whom Athena is friendly, and there are other Gods and Goddesses to whom Athena is friendly, but being friendly and being 'friends' are two different things.<br>  <br>  Athena is very much a Daddy's girl, although in a very tomboyish sort of way. The closest I can approximate that is in the Pretender tv series, the relationship that Mrs. Parker had with her father. She is his enforcer, the person allowed to carry his thunderbolts, but she isn't really 'friends' with other people.<br>  <br>  Athena and Hephesteus can be considered friendly, or as close to friends-by-association as you can get, but Athena probably is the most alone of all the virgin Goddesses.|`|tJ2lzTSmaa	ya the animals

70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	I don't know if it would be a good argument, but food has never been the only cause of obesity or overeating. Normally it's a combination of factors such as emotional (eating as a way to cope with a negative situation), physical (genetics, hormonal imbalances), and psychological (mental conditions such as Prader-Willie syndrome).

I have no problem with being alone, as long as God is there with me.<br>  <br>  You want to do better in school? Then study. God can't study for you or write your tests. You need to do these things yourself. This is one of the many ways people learn, which is exactly what God wants.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Why is there evil and suffering in the world? <br>  The curious as well as the critics of Christianity ask this question. If God is all-powerful and all loving, then why does He permit evil and suffering in the world? Various answers have been given but permanently settling the issue is impossible because so many of our answers raise further questions. Nevertheless, our lack of ability to answer the question perfectly does not mean that we cannot offer solutions. Of course, I do not assume to be able to answer these questions definitively, but I can offer some solutions.<br>  <br>  First of all, it is possible that God has reasons for allowing evil to exist that we simply cannot understand. In this the Christian can have confidence in God knowing that His ways are above our ways (Isaiah 55:8-9). As the Bible says, the just shall live by faith (Hab. 2:4).<br>  <br>  Second, God may be letting evil run its course in order to prove that evil is evil and that suffering, which is the unfortunate product of evil, is further proof that anything contrary to God’s will is bad, harmful, painful, and leads to death.<br>  <br>  God gave Adam dominion over the world (Gen. 1:28). When he rebelled against God, he set in motion an entire series of events and changed the very nature of man and creation. Both were affected by sin. Creation was no longer a paradise, but bore thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:17-18; Rom. 8:22). People became sinful (Rom. 5:12; Eph. 2:3), who were haters of God (Rom. 3:19-12), etc. The only conclusion to such a situation is death. Jesus said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened" (Matt. 24:22).<br>  <br>  Sin is rebellion against God and His created order. But God has not left us alone in this fallen world. He continued to enter this world, pointing us to Himself, to truth, to morality, purity, and love. He used the evil of the world (liars, perjurers, the envious, etc), to bring His Son to the cross so that we might have the opportunity of eternal life. In this, God has not stepped away from fallen creation, but has stepped into it by becoming Jesus. God works within the fallen world to affect change and He uses fallen people to accomplish His will. In this, He is proving His sovereignty over evil, suffering, and rebellious people, proving that sin and evil are utterly futile, and that He is worthy of honor and glory.<br>  <br>  A third possible reason that God is letting evil occur is so that on the day of judgment, the condemned will have no right to say that their sentence is unjust. God is not stopping people from exercising their free will. Think about this: If someone said that God should stop evil and suffering, then should God then stop all evil and suffering? If God only stopped some of it, then we would still be asking the same question of why it exists. So, if we want God to stop evil and suffering, then He must stop all of it. We have no problem with this when it means stopping a catastrophe, or a murder, or a rape. But what about when someone thinks of something evil? Evil is evil whether it is acted out or not. Hatred and bigotry in someone’s heart is wrong. If it is wrong, and if God is to stop all evil, then He must stop that person from thinking his own thoughts. To do that, God must remove his freedom of thought. Furthermore, which person on the earth has not thought something evil? God would be required, then, to stop all people from exercising their free will. This is something God has chosen not to do. Therefore, we could say that one of the reasons that God permits evil and suffering is because of man’s free will.<br>  <br>  Fourth, it is quite possible that God uses the suffering to do good. In other words, He produces patience through tribulation (Rom. 5:3). Or He may desire to save someone through it. Take for example, the account of Joseph who was sold into slavery by His brothers. What they did was wrong and Joseph suffered greatly for it. But, later, God raised up Joseph in Egypt to make provisions for the people of that land during the coming drought of seven years. But not only was Egypt saved, but also so was his family and brothers who originally sold him into slavery. Joseph finally says to them, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good" (Gen. 50:15-21). Of course, the greatest example of God using evil for good is the death of Christ. Evil people brought him to the cross, but God used that cross as the means to save the world.<br>  <br>  But then we must ask, if this is true, are we working against God by working against evil and suffering? No, we are not. God says he does not want us to sin and suffer. But it is simply true that God can use evil despite of its apparent despicable nature.<br>  <br>  God is in the world using the world and its failures for His glory and the benefit of those who listen to Him.<br>  <br>  But then, what about those who seem to innocently suffer with no benefit resulting? What about the woman who is raped, or the innocent by stander who is killed by a stray bullet. In both cases, the victims and families suffer nothing but pain and loss. What good can this possibly be?<br>  <br>  I think that the answer is two-fold. One, ultimately, no one is innocent. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23) and are by nature children of wrath (Eph. 2:3). There is none innocent. Though this is biblically accurate, it does not satisfy the question emotionally. Why do little babies suffer for things they have not done? I must acknowledge that I do not know. Ultimately, we must trust God who knows the beginning from the end and sees the grand picture. He will have the final word and He will be vindicated.<br>  <br>  Conclusion<br>  Suffering is the result of human sin. The world is not the way that God created it and because of that, all are vulnerable to the affects of sin in the world. Why does one person suffer and another does not? Why do catastrophes happen to some and no others? It is because sin is in the world. But there will come a day when the Lord will return and cleanse this world of all sin and all suffering.<br>  <br>  "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away," (Rev. 21:4).
q0gRmHlUaa	If you go visit him in his area it will probably catch him by surprise and cause him to lose interest.  I think the mission office letter would be a good idea.  You may also want to talk with the current missionaries in your area or attend the farewell ceremony (if there is one) when your missionary goes home.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	I think another email wishing him a safe return home and thanking him for his service would be sufficient.

I don't think you need to wait a few months (for some guys you would, personally I was ready to date as soon as I got home as I then knew my mission was over).<br>  <br>  I did return to my mission, and while hanging out with a family I was friends with I found that one girl had feelings for me but wouldn't tell me until after I got home.

I think you were just mean, mopping the floor with her self-esteem. I'm glad you feel some remorse. What she said was from her heart. What you said to her was just not necessary. It was a chance for you to be a good guy. Her words seemed a bit unkind, but I can't be totally sure that she said what you remember she said. I would have tried to let it go.

Once I got stopped for speeding which led to a DUI arrest because they smelled alcohol and I was just over the legal limit - which is pretty much like 2 or 3 drinks for anyone (and I had probably had 3, so wasn't drunk, but would show over the legal limit)...this "friend" was the same way - all holier than thou and lecturing me about it...*every* time she saw me for the next couple years.  All the while I was wondering to myself where she got off as I never understood how she got home most nights in that almost blacked out condition without harming herself or someone else.  Well, a couple years ago - several years after mine, guess who "got caught".  And same thing, she was looking for sympathy.  Yeah, I let her have it too.  And I'm also usually not mean to people - but in some cases, perhaps they should think before they speak and realize that they are not immune to making mistakes. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't feel too badly about it if I were you.  She should take her own medicine to a point, since she was so willing to give it out.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Yeah. I don't think you feel bad about it. Good for you. She was being a hypocrite and I am glad you did it. It probably took a lot of pressure off you that you didn't realize you had. Now you have a clear conscience and if you both are willing, you can start over on the friendship.|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	You sound like you just didn't want to hurt her feelings, but she seems like the type of person who can say anything she wants to but just don't like people to say it back.

If you want to be the first type, there's a couple of things you can try.  <br>  1) Smile More<br>  2) Be interested in what someone has to say when you chat.<br>  3) When talking to people, make direct eye contact<br>  4) Stand straight.  This sounds strange but it's true.  Body language plays a part in people's impression of you.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	An aggressive vibe, and one that has a potential to explode without warning, those are all defensive postures you describe. You need to talk to these people and ask them outright, whether or not you make them uncomfortable and why.|`|xnsU60hhaa	I don't know exactly what kind of vibe you are giving people, but they seem to be nervous and defensive around you. Perhaps you could confide in someone you feel close too? And never having been invited to a friends home, means they aren't really friends. That is just too strange.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Arm folding is a defensive posture. Finger tapping implies nervousness, impatience and boredom. Not inviting you into conversations implies a confrontational avoidance. Simply ask in the Presence of as many as can be together at the same time, Why are you uncomfortable around me? Are you some weird political activist? Have you committed some crime and just got out of prison or got off free? Have you been accused of some sex crime? I have to admit this is really strange behavior. I would ask point blank. Someone is bound to give an answer and the others may join in and it will all get cleared up. Good luck with this.|`|yk4S7uuraa	You may come off to be unapproachable or "standoffish."<br>  <br>  People don't feel comfortable talking to you because they feel you might downgrade them or "turn them in" so to speak.<br>  <br>  I found people treated me like that when I was younger, and then I tried to show people that I'm interested in them, and sympathetic of their feelings. Watch your body language, they me read you as being "too aggressive" or show that you are "above" them. When I was in college, a girl that I liked and wanted to date, told me that I was too conceited, and she didn't feel right being around me and didn't want to develop a relationship. That woke me up!<br>  <br>  You can change, it just takes a little work...Good Luck!!
FOzN3xwzaa	No, you haven't committed it.  Since you'd be dead right now if you did. <br>  <br>  The blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is dying without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.<br>  <br>  The message of the Holy Spirit is that believing in Jesus alone is the only way to be forgiven of your sins and to be saved and to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  The person who dies without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation, is unforgiven and is therefore sent to hell for eternal torment. <br>  <br>  So believe in Jesus alone for salvation right now, and you will never be able to blaspheme the Holy Spirit :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|nkMbQFv7aa	The Unpardonable Sin: Blasphemy<br>  <br>  Mark 3:28-29<br>  <br>  28Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; <br>  29 but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation<br>  <br>  Mathew 12:31-32<br>  <br>  31 Wherefore I say unto you: All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.<br>  12:32 And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.|`|3vmDRCTCaa	John 6:37, John 6:44, Psalm 147:11, Isaiah 50:2, 2 Peter 3:9<br>  <br>  Start out with those and send me a message if you want some more.

There are passages in John, in Isaiah, and a few other places which cover Repentance and how it is achieved.<br>  When your heart understands the same way as is in the Bible, then you will find that the sin you guard is given up to God.|`|urlDKYPraa	Amazing how many of these answers are from christians who don't even know what you mean by the unforgivable sin. I committed it long ago.<br>  <br>  In my case, it doesn't matter. Since I was born as a result of an adulterous affair ( I am literally a bastard ), I and all my children for 9 more generations can never go to heaven anyway.<br>  <br>  God damned me to hell before I was born for my parents sins. (b/c he's a loving god) So I figured I may as well commit the unforgivable one too.

Clearly no one who does this can be forgiven, because it is through the Holy Spirit that we are forgiven. Also, no one who thinks that the Holy Spirit is Satan will permit himself to be guided by Him or filled with Him or given gifts by Him. So just as pulling the main breaker in your house means that you can never receive electricity, blaspheming against the Holy Spirit means that you can never receive forgiveness, because it turns off the tap through which forgiveness flows! <br>  <br>  So to those who are troubled: the surest sign that you have not committed the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the very fact that you are worried about it, because that shows that the Holy Spirit is very definitely on speaking terms with you!|`|mVsWyu0yaa	Michael:<br>  There is no SIN except in the guilt-ridden minds of Christians who have been made to believe that they are nothing more than 'filthy worms' who need to slather themselves with the blood of an executed  criminal to wash themselves clean. It is a sick, masochistic notion.  <br>  <br>  As to the 'unforgivable sin against the Holy Ghost'....that is pure Caca De Toro. It was invented so that poor christians whould  not  ever realize that the warm fuzzy feeling they get when they read about the God of the Old Testament killing tens of thousand of innocent children, is NOT the prompting of any "holy Ghost".  The best way to keep people ignorant, and in line, is to threaten them with some sort of heavenly retribution for daring to think for themselves.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	If you are looking for true repentence then no, you did not commit the Unforgiveable Sin.|`|ob3i2TN8aa	All you have to do is bury the gun, and ditch the corpse in the ocean.

There is too much evidence that aliens visited us 1,000's of years ago, and even more recently. There are some ruins in South America, recently discovered, believed to be 17,000 year old, where perfectly straight lines were cut at a uniform depth about 5 mm wide and 2 mm deep cut in a rock called corundum, the second hardest material on the planet, next to diamonds.

It is my belief that the Bible is God's revelation to man, for many reasons I won't go into here (unless you want me to of course). Read it, read about it. See for yourself God's plan, God's call.<br>  <br>  Now, all those who believe in the Bible will of course "rally around it," so to speak. That's Christianity. There are different divisions (which is sad), but we all basically believe the same thing: God's son came to die for our sins so we could be reconciled back to God. <br>  <br>  If God is real, there will not be a disorganized path to Him that people guess at and determine for themselves. We do not see disorganization in His creation, so it is only logical to assume that He is a God of order, not of chaos. Think of biology, physics, the heavens, any physical thing you can think of. <br>  <br>  Like His creation, His revelation will have unity, harmony; and He will want those who believe Him to be the same in respect to each other.<br>  <br>  So: search.|`|Jwjfpoteaa	You miss the point of Holy Communion: the meeting of two or more gathered in His name. Though my faith in God would stand now without Church or Congregation, without others there is no means to validate that I am still working in the Way.<br>  The point of your thought here is to demonstrate that you do not believe in anything BUT God - not His Works, not the worship of God, not of any attempt by humans to reach toward God, but just God for God's sake. On one hand, that is good, because God should be honored in that manner. My faith is a witness to God's work on Earth and within the humans and their races. For that, you must study scripture and understand those who went before you.<br>  And that is the study of religion. For that, my beloved child, you will have to look at God through the eyes of others. Come on down. The water's fine.|`|g54tGcRvaa	I guess.  I'm a Pantheist, if that counts.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	I see no reason to believe in a god, as gods are merely the product of religion.<br>  <br>  But I don't begrudge anyone their right to believe in such things.  Dogma is the enemy.
ZJ2k7Ynqaa	You went above and beyond the call of duty taking care of your mother.  You don't need to feel guilty about your brother.  You were ill yourself because of the stress you were under.  However, no one is "good enough" to deserve eternal life.  We all have numerous sins and our only hope is in trusting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Savior.  It's not just believing that Christ lived that gets us into heaven.  It's "receiving" Him into our lives (see John 1:12).  For an example, if you received a guest into your home, you would probably first offer him a seat and serve him coffee or something.  In the same way, we need to serve the Lord with our lives.  We need to let Him guide us and determine to live for Him.  We owe Him that since He died a horrible death on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins.   By rising again the third day, He made a way for us to be accepted by God, the Father.  Since heaven is a holy place, no sin is allowed there.  When God looks at a believer, instead of our sin, He sees the righteousness of Christ, which makes us fit for heaven.  If you realize that your sins have offended a holy God and ask His forgiveness, trusting that Jesus died for your sins, and allowing Him to be your Lord, He will adopt you into His family and you will inherit heaven.  A great blessing of salvation is that your guilt will be gone.  However, even after salvation, we sin sometimes and need to confess it to God (see 1 John 1:9).  <br>  Sorry this is so long.  I'll pray for you. <br>  Please read the Bible, New Testament first. Here are some verses to look up that may help you:  Romans 10:13, Romans 5:8, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, John 3:16, Proverbs 3:5,6; Philippians 4:6-8. <br>  Also, please look for a Bible-believing church to attend for fellowship and support.<br>  Once you have Christ in your life, you won't feel lost and alone.  He will bless your life.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	because that's what Christ does for you. :)|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	The bible says there is only 1 "unforgivable sin" and the bible DOES NOT  say what that sin is,so no mere human knows.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	The only unforgivable sin is the sin of refusing forgiveness.|`|UrpxXDPSaa	Don't listen to anything god says, he isn't real|`|FOzN3xwzaa	ALL SINS past, present, and future, are forgiven when the person believes in Jesus alone for salvation.  No matter what those sins are.  <br>  <br>  The only unforgivable sin, is dying without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.<br>  <br>  The message of the Holy Spirit is that believing in Jesus alone is the only way to be forgiven of your sins and to be saved and to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  The person who dies without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation, is unforgiven and is therefore sent to hell for eternal torment. <br>  <br>  So believe in Jesus alone for salvation right now, and you will never be able to blaspheme the Holy Spirit :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|UDEMDcGuaa	As far as I know the only unforgivable sin is denial of the holy spirit or something like that,<br>   If you have sinned then repent, ask the lord for forgiveness and try to make amends as best you can|`|nVhP1Bteaa	I was told in Sunday School ( 35+yrs ago.) that there was only one unforgivable sin.

0REcd4sAaa	I felt enlightened when I stopped believing in God.|`|AA12059478	I would nominate The Dalai Lama.|`|AIZvfgscaa	The word 'enlightened or enlightenment' is somewhat misused; in so far as, it does not refer solely to 'great spiritual figures' like the Buddha.<br>  You and I, for example, can have a moment of enlightenment, when an idea long thought out is finally realised, or a moment of some great insight come to our minds, such moments lift ones consciousness a little higher so that by gradual degrees, ones mind becomes free of much of the hustle and bustle of daily life which grinds away and is commonly known as the 'rat race,' which one get so easily get caught up in.<br>  In short, enlightenment can be a moment of inspiration and need not be a spiritual being here on earth.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	Yes, there are.

BhXwQ2n1aa	as long as you know how to alphabetize, you're good to go. you'd most likely be putting books back on the shelves, checking in returned books, picking up after the kids in the play area if there is one, and making sure books are in the correct spots. boring stuff but somebody has to do it. <br>  <br>  good for you for volunteering! that's great|`|W9XTYRHpaa	Believe it or not, librarians have more to take care of than checking out books! I could imagine that you would possibly put books back to their proper locations, which wouldn't require that much skill to do, just alphabetizing. Also, depending on how crowded your local library is, you might read for some little children. This would be harder and require people and reading skills for reading at awkward angles, so that the children may see the pictures. The latter will probably be more rewarding.

zc47c39daa	I don't know the story of the Bermuda Triangle, and I've only been watching Lost this season, but from what I've seen, if the Bermuda Triangle has to do with time travel, then it may very well be related.<br>  <br>  Lost is a very mind boggling series. It gives you one piece of the puzzle, changes it around a million times, gives you another answer, and so on and so forth.
