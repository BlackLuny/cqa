20090219224452AAQplW9	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	PLEASE HELP ME! Accident over a month and a half ago, now a 200 dollar ticket!?	A month and a half ago there was a snow emergency. Cars were to be off the street. I backed out of a driveway, and put a very small dent in a young girls car. I didn't even realize I did it until I noticed the neighbors looking at me funny, and I asked them the prob.      They say "I think you hit her car". So TRYING to be a good citizen I go to the girls door, and tell her I think I hit her. She comes out and looks and goes "where?" I pointed it out and she goes oh yeah its fine no big deal, we call the cops, they refuse to make a report for minimal damage. I leave. Well she calls me up and starts harrassing me a month later. I go in to file a accident report at the police station and they give me a ticket for "Improper Backing". It costs $200 dollars!       Does this sound legit? I mean a month and half later, when the original officer who came to the scene wouldnt write a report or ticket? Should I fight it? HELP!

Using the Al Gore calculator, (you know the one that takes a little data and then multiplies it out to a ridiculous number), let's see what gas prices will be by the end of Obama's four years.      208 weeks in Obama's term X .2075 rise in the price per week + the original $1.23 price per gallon on inauguration day = $44.39 per gallon      If the American people are dumb enough to elect him again that would be 416 weeks      416 weeks X .2075 + $1.23 = $87.55 per gallon      If Joe Biden then does two terms that would be a total of 832 weeks.      832 weeks X .2075 + $1.23 = $173.87 per gallon.      Yeah...there's that "Change" we were waiting for!      Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Castro were all "Change" proving that not all "Change" is good.

For hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs during the recession, there's a new twist to their financial pain: Even as they're collecting unemployment benefits, they're paying bank fees just to get access to their money.      Thirty states have struck such deals with banks that include Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JP Morgan Chase and US Bancorp, an Associated Press review of the agreements found. All the programs carry fees, and in several states the unemployed have no choice but to use the debit cards. Some banks even charge overdraft fees of up to $20 — even though they could decline charges for more than what's on the card.      "It's a racket. It's a scam," said Rachel Davis, a 38-year-old dental technician from St. Louis who was laid off in October. Davis was given a MasterCard issued through Central Bank of Jefferson City and recently paid $6 to make two $40 withdrawals.      Here's the rest of the story. Think we get burned enough yet?

This is where I stand      I am a christian   I am a 9/11 Truther (I have critical thinking skills)   Anyone who thinks 9/11 was done by osama is a braindead moron   I am anti-war   I am anti-nwo   I vote for people like Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin (Anti Nwo. Pro liberties)   I have no stance on abortion or homosexuality. I am not for or against, because I just dont know where to stand on these issues.      I am a proud future Draft Dodger, I believe all should dodge.      Draft Dodgers are Hero's. I look upto them.      I believe In Civil Liberties and Gun rights.      I am Anti NAU   I dont know to much about this, but i think all the countries of the world should abolish there militaries and there governments, and everybody should have the option to own a gun. (Hitler, Stalin agrees gun control works) Also everybody at 18 in the world should pledge to never goto warand they abolish the SSS as well. I assume there will never be a war ever again, Again i dont know to much about this.      I believe in law enforcement, Law and Order.      I do not support the troops.      I do not support the government      I believe Everyone is Capable of every crime, and we do not necessarily have free will.      I believe the U.S. Military Needs to get out of our schools!      If people absolutely must join the military, which nobody should right now, because of these 2 illegal wars, then they need to raise the minimum age to 21 At least, Maybe higher.      I believe people who support bush and what the damage he did to my nation, are stupid and hate liberty.      I know the truth, that wars are staged for profits of the elites.   I know about the New World Order.      I believe Iraq and Afghanistan are both illegal wars and should have never happened, and they need to end now.

20090220002334AAZYRO4	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Isn't the Social Security Administration discriminating against the disabled?	The SSA allows disabled to get a check. The amount is calculated to accurately reflect the need of the disabled person within that state. The SSA also provides Medicare. Unfortunately Medicare doesn't pay for everything and new laws even require a co-payment. Where does the SSA suggest the disabled get that money? I suppose they expect the disabled to work full-time self-employed to make a few dollars (way less than an able bodied person would for the same input time) In their eyes that's okay because they give a check to make up the difference. Okay, another problem arises...if the disabled has made some money, their check gets reduced! Now they have to make that money up also. The disabled works harder. Oh no....they reduce it again...the disabled works until they get sick or injure themselves. Now they owe money to the SSA so their check gets reduced and they live less of a life than when they attempted to start work. What happened to "the pursuit of happiness" that our constitution promises all of our citizens? Do the disabled fit in there somewhere or don't they count also? It seems to me that the disabled are NOT allowed to have the american dream. What is your opinion?

I have a few questions about the National Guard, I was hoping some of you could help me with. If I do sign into the Guard it will probably be in August when I turn 17. I will then go to boot camp in June 2010.   So here are a few questions      1. If the unit that I am attached to is mobilized to work in a flood watch area or goes on a peace keeping run, will I be going with them? I wont have gone to boot yet, so I didn't know if I could do those sorts of things.      2. In the National Guard I know you make like 180 bucks for your weekend drills, is that all you make? I was talking to an enlisted member earlier today and he said he makes close to 30,000 a year. I didn't get the chance to talk to him very long though. So I don't know all the circumstances.      3. Now my sisters boyfriend is also in the Guard, but currently deployed to Iraq. I was going to wait til he got home to enlist but its not given that he'll be back by the end of the year. He was going to go with me so if I did join he would get that bonus. Could he still get the bonus even if he was deployed when I joined and used him as a referral?      4. I'm looking to be a 31b MP. What does an MP do in the National Guard? I've read on active duty, you'll work security on base. Any similarities?      Those are just a few questions I have right now. I'm sure I'll have a million more but I wont ask them all here.      Thanks for any helpful answers you can provide.

These neighbors play music from 10 pm to 4 or 5 am.  At least 5 days a week.  From across the alley.  It's been about a month.  Tonight, I ended up getting so frustrated that I called the building management.  At 1:00 am, but still!  To be honest, I didn't think anyone would pick up.  She was incredibly hostile towards me.  Yelled at me, and told me it wasn't  HER problem, and that my building keeps her tenants up until 10 pm (totally true, because I live in an artist's building, and people practice, but we DO have a strict 10 pm curfew,and if anyone complains, we are respectful and quiet down).  But 10 pm is NOT 4 am.  Like I said, she was hostile, said it wasn't her problem, and refused to do anything about it.  She said I should just ucall the police.  So, I did.  They came and were really nice, but they couldn't do anything, because they couldn't get into the building (obviously).  I was told to get ear plugs.  1.  I can't live with ear plugs stuck in my ears all the time, 2. I have to wake up to an alarm 3. It's too loud for even that.      my question is:  Is there anyone (a group, bureau, or something) that I can report her to?  Aren't there rules about this sort of thing?      I live in the city of Chicago, if that's of any importance.    Any help would be geatly appreciated!!      Thanks!

In November I was late for work bc of a mix up with daylight savings time.  That evening my Manager/Boss presented me with a write up for suspension and said I was to return the next saturday to meet with him and "discuss my future at the restaurant". I had been at this restaurant for 3 years and I knew that was my pink slip. I went on to ask my boss "Am I being fired?". My boss said "You have been here for a long time and I'm going to be blunt with you--I have no choice but to let you go". I then said "So I guess there's no point in signing a suspension and coming back?" He said "No". The same night I went home and filed for unemployment. I called my employer a few weeks later to see if they could mail me my final paycheck. The HR Manager basically attempted to coerce me into saying I had quit. I explained that she was mistaken and she denied the entire exchange took place. Needless to say, I was denied benefits on the grounds that XXX stated that I had voluntarily quit. I have appealed and my hearing is on Tuesday. I know I have the truth on my side--but is that enough?    How do I handle a blatant lie and come out on top? I don't see it likely that they'll decide to tell the truth just bc they are under oath. I am in California.

20060624213455AAfyYd7	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	How big is your family (Think bigger than biology...)?	I have been preoccupied with this question because it causes us to examine how we define the group of people to which we have a relationship and for which we feel a responsibility.       For example, if your family is as big as your school district, you won't believe in property taxes going into a state pool and distributed to all school districts equally based on need. If your family is as big is your state, you will believe in richer school districts funding poor school districts within the same state.      For example, if your family is as bigger than your country, you may believe that immigrants should be allowed the basic priviledges of U.S. citizens such as in-state tuition to state schools or Medicaid.       If you family ends at your driveway, you may think, "Me for me and you for you; who gives a crap about anybody outside my circle."      Just curious, how big is YOUR family and why?

Around 600 rounds, here in the Philippines while remodelling an old church.      The rounds appear to be pistol rounds, have a slight taper on them and are ball rounds. I checked the shells for caliber, but found 43, 44, or 45 stamped on the bottom with no manufacturer information. All the rounds are identical in dimensions however, despite the different markings on their shells.      I have researched the internet for any information regarding these rounds but my search turned up nothing. I suspect that the numbers stamped on the shells are their years of manufacture. If so, then they would quite obviously be WW2 vintage. However, these rounds do not look like any of the cartridges I've seen on the more popular WW2 personal weapons.

After restitution and a one year period, my probation ended and the case was dismissed, as are most cases under a CWOF.

Every year, when you are paying your taxes, there would be a sheet with a list of all government departments/programs. Every department and program would have a check box next to it. Taxpayers could check off the programs and departments they wished to fund, and choose what percentages of their taxes go to those programs.       For example, a war supporter could choose to give 70% of his taxes to the military, and 30% to transportation. Another citizen might choose to give 0% to the military, and 100% to environmental protection. This way, government spending would truly reflect the will of the taxpayers.       Under this plan, you'd still have to pay taxes, but you'd get to directly choose how they were spent. What do you think of this idea? Do you think it would be good, or is this "too much" democracy?       Please add your political affiliation (Republican, liberal, communist, moderate ...whatever fits you) with your answer. Detailed answers are best!

Me surge la duda porque una tipa en una pregunta que lei en la semana dice que entonces se debe obligar a los que no apoyan al aborto a adoptar a los ni?os no deseados y entonces si se aprueba la ley se va a obligar a los proabortistas a pagar los abortos de las miles de mujeres que no tengan dinero para pagar o que?   Yo la verdad lo dudo si tan solo el embarazo sin hospitalizacion te cuesta 5,000 en una clinica regular un aborto cuanto costará?

20070416172940AAmEwQD	Politics & Government;Military	Should I join the United States Navy or her Air Force?	I'm currently a high school junior and I am thinking about a career in the U.S. military. I've narrowed the choices down to the two branches mentioned above based on family connections, opportunities, and benefits. I've talked to recruiters from both branches. I've gotten a higher than normal ASVAB, but my high school track record isn't the most impressive . I'm still unsure on what I want to do in either. I was thinking about a career in foreign diplomacy or the nuclear field or possibly cryptolgy or maybe...haha. I don't know. I've always wanted to travel and learn about both similar and different cultures and I have no dependents so I'm free to go wherever. Also I've lived in the desert my whole life so I don't know how I'd feel about BMT at Lackland. I understand that it's my decision but, I'd really appreciate the help.          P.S. My prayers and condolences to those affected by the shootings at VT.

20070715141602AA4JRe4	Politics & Government;Military	Why does this make a Vietnam Veteran sad?	INTRODUCTION           "You know you never defeated us on the           battlefield," said the American colonel.           The North Vietnamese colonel pondered           this remark a moment.  "That may be so,"           he replied, "but it is also irrelavent."                             Conversation in Hanoi, April 19751       This project began with the question, "How could a   country win all the battles, and yet still lose the war?"   How could a country which is as rich and powerful as our   own, superior in every measurable category of military   strength, emerge as the loser with one of the world's   smallest and poorest countries?  Why are our greatest   victories remembered as defeats?  Why would a Congress that   approved the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 with only two   dissenting votes turn its back on its South Vietnamese ally   when the North Vietnamese launched a full-scale conventional   invasion only eight years later?       In seeking answers to these questions it became readily   apparent that the American defense of South Vietnam was   brought to its unhappy conclusion not by a failure of   American arms, but rather by a failure of American will.   Former President Nixon said it this way:            The War in Vietnam was not lost on the            battlefields of Vietnam.  It was lost            in the halls of Congress ... in the            editorial rooms of great newspapers ...            and in the classrooms of great            universities.2

20090203114647AAlarnS	Politics & Government;Elections	Admit to wrongdoing & guilt   only if  you are caught ?	Have you ever noticed how less than a month into his term; ALL of those members of Obama's Administration that have been allegedly involved in some kind of wrongdoing  & guilt have ONLY come forward admitting  re: their wrongdoing  & guilt  ONLY AFTER they were caught &  their wrongdoing was exposed by someone else ?      Why is it that ALL of those members of Obama's cabinet waited until they were caught engaging in some form of wrongdoing & not  one member of Obama's cabinet came forward on their own and said ' I have gone over my prior tax returns with my accountant and I have discovered that; although the IRS never picked up on this,  I did not pay my fair share of taxes that I was supposed to  so I have taken it upon my self to write a check to the IRS covering both the back taxes that I owe +  penalties that I owe.

20090203113651AAB8pIv	Politics & Government;Politics	Is it funny to you when people on the other side ask questions about your views, but have already blocked you?	I just tried to look at a question asked by ">yummy<" about Republicans' views on "big business" not paying their "fair share" in taxes, and discovered he/she had blocked me.  I don't even know who that is!      Anyway, do you find it to be anything less than completely hypocritical that someone would ask a question that is directly addressed to a group of people, only to have already blocked people in that group?  Has anyone else noticed this happening?  Do people who do this somehow feel powerful or superior, knowing they blocked people who obviously were going to give them an answer that would make them look bad?      FYI, I have never blocked anyone.  And yes, I'm sure this happens on both sides.

20090203114324AABlB8m	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does everyone blame the Bush administration for the financial crisis?	President Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is much more at fault than Bush. He was on the board of directors for Freddie Mac while all that crap that lead to this economic crisis was going on and didn't even see it.      so why is everyone pointing the finger at Bush and not the companies that are actually responsible?      personally, I think that the Dems were (and still are) trying to use Bush as a scapegoat for anything wrong in the world, no matter how unrelated, so they can try and glorify Obama.
20090203113149AAta2lw	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do I need to go back to court to dispute child support payment?	My best friend is paying $400 a month for his 4 yr. old son! He did hire an attorney to represent him during his divorce,but $400 a month was the judgement. I understand they base your child support payment off of your income, but the income they based this off of was what he made years ago, the most he's ever made and comission based income, he no longer makes near that. He didn't even make that at the time he went to court. He makes $10 a hour and works a 40 hour week. The issue he has is he cannot afford to support himself now with this outrageous child support payment. (We won't even go into his lazy ex, the mother, getting government funding in every area she can possibly think of,but, to judge her character it's worth mentioning) My point is, he's a good father and has every intention of supporting his son, but isn't $400 a month for a 4 yr. old a little much?? Can't a line be drawn when he can't afford to support himself with out working 3 jobs?  Can he contact the attorney general to discuss reconsidering or does he need to have legal representation and go back to court??Just curious to hear some feedback...Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

20081011095318AAcNYTe	Politics & Government;Elections	How can you support palin?	Im just really curious. Honestly, I HATE her more then I hate most people. Why? Well, let me tell you.      She supports the killing of wolves in alaska. Why? Because they are killing moose and caribou, and making it harder for HUNTERS to hunt for SPORT! Shes not even conserned about the native tribes that live up there and rely on caribou as food. Nope, shes just concerned about the poor hunters who cant shoot an animal for fun.      Then, in 2007, enough wolves werent killed for her. She was hoping for 600, but only 115 were killed. So now, anyone who kills a wolf and brings in its left paw gets 150$!!!      She has no respect for science! hundreds of scientists have written her letters, PLEADING for her to stop, telling her that removing natural predators destroys ecosystems! The earth is a fragile web built of millions of tiny pieces. Remove a few, and the whole thing can fail. But she doesnt care. She blatanly states she has no need for science.      And you know how they kill these wolves? They take helicopters and slow flying planes, and chase them down. They wait until winter, when the wolves are easily spotted, and then pretty much shoot them down. And its not a clean kill. Flying in a plane shooting at a running, terrified animal. They blow off chunks of meat and legs and sides and face, until finally the animal falls. And if they cant kill it, they chase it until it is exhausted and collapses, then they land and shoot it.      Honestly, does anyone wonder why she has a mentally challenged child? Maybe its karma. This is horrible to say, but for someone who has so much disrespect for life, I hope she loses someone close to her. Then maybe she can truly understand death.      So, for all you supporters, I would just like to hear your reasons why? Why support someone who has no respect for anything on our planet except the joys of humans?         BTW, wolves are mostly scavengers. About 70% of what they eat is scavenged from already dead animals. one wolf pack will MAYBE take down one or two animals a month, MAYBE. So how is that really destroying a hunters chance?

The wolf hunts are needed to  keep up the moose and caribou population.        They are  also needed to keep the wolves from turning on human-populated areas,  after other food sources run out.      Are liberals simply too hysterical and overemotional to understand these basic facts of life in a place like Alaska?   .

It could be, after all you do believe in someone that shout change to be able to give America a better life. Both have the qualities but if you look at McCain as He is then you will see a great man in the making.   You can made it happen by putting Him in office.

20090203113739AAiCJmF	Politics & Government;Politics	Were Peers 'At it' in 1865?	The 1865  Locomotives on Turnpike and Other Roads Act, the "Red Flag" Act, introduced a 4 m.p.h. limit on highways and mechanical vehicles had to be preceded by a man carrying a red flag.      Author L. J. K. Setright speculated that the Locomotive Acts were put in place to suppress motor car development in the United Kingdom, because of the financial interests that some members of government and other establishment personalities had in the development and viability of the railway industry.      Under pressure from motor car enthusiasts, including Coventry manufacturer Harry J. Lawson, the government introduced the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 which eased the way for the development of the British motor industry.       Source: Wikipedia.

But based on electoral votes....even if McCain somehow won ALL the battleground states, he still can't get enough electorals to win.

20081006180843AAeN6xh	Politics & Government;Politics	Now will you admit Bush Presidency worst ever?	Bush got us into 2 unnecessary wars by fabricating evidence and lying, ignored warnings of immanent attack from CIA and FBI, gave away no-bid contracts to his friends worth billions and billions, held secret meetings with energy companies including Enron where they developed their policies and kept them secret.  Refused to answer subpoenas.  OK'd torture.  Revealed diplomat's wife's secret CIA identity because diplomat disagreed with him.  Called our long time allies "Chicken" because they did not support his wars.  Spied on the American people illegally.  Did away with Habeas Corpus.  Gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 10%.   Didn't go after Osama Ben Laden.  Ignored the warnings of hurricane Katrina and left New Orleans to bail itself out.  Increased government spending exponentially and funded his wars by putting the USA in debt to CHina.  Supported a bail out scheme that supports the wealthy and gives middle America nothing.  Over 8 years turned what had been an  economic surplus and a somewhat shrunk government into the largest debt and growing and the largest government and growing in our nation's history.  He is voiceless and powerless in the world because he's lost all credibility.   He makes Andrew Johnson, James Buchanan and Herbert Hoover look like pikers.   He is most likely the worst president in this nation's history

PERO ?si hubiera una forma de agilizar este proceso de votacion de decisiones?, por ejemplo a traves del voto on-line  o cualquier otro metodo que aporte rapidez y claridad al asunto...   el voto online es solo un metodo de los tantos que podriamos aplicar, claro que para este mismo deberiamos suponer que todos o almenos la mayoria tiene computadora o que aunque no la tuviese podria axeder a ella de alguna manera   tambien esta el hecho del hackeo, sin embargo todo esto eso es algo trivial , alo que se le podria encontrar una solucion viable.

But now that gas has dropped to around $2.50 a gallon again, no one says anything about it?   Again, the liberal media attacks the Bush administration and blames it for all the woes of the country, but will not acknowledge the good.   I don't understand how our citizens are so easily misled and cannot think for themselves!      Is anyone frightened by Obama's connection to Bill Ayers?   Does anyone wonder how all these wonderful new programs to help the poor will be funded?   Does it bother anyone that Obama has spent $245 million more in his campaign than McCain, using PUBLIC funds?   How can anyone attend the same church for 20 years and not know what a racist their pastor is?   Why does the Liberal media attack McCain for questioning Obama's history of drug use, saying that it should not matter because it was his past, but then do a full background check on a PRIVATE citizen and slander his name?   Why does the prospect of socialized medicine and free healthcare excite so many, when it has failed in the countries that already have the same programs?      I honestly don't understand the thinking patterns of some Americans.

20090203113415AAgLmjM	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why is marijuana illegal?	They say marijuana is illegal, but they never explain why exactly. They say it is very addictive, but so are cigaretts. They say it messes up your mind, but so does alcohol. If it causes cancer then it is in the same boat as cigaretts. There are lots of deaths and crimes cause by it, but the same thing happened when alcohol was illegal. So far the only difference i found is that the goverment can make money from it. So according to this the government is ok with killing anyone anytime as long as they make money off of it. So in this country money is more important than life.

I have been told with 2 years of good conduct and all my obligations i.e. community service and fines paid off, i can be taken off probation with a year and a half- 2 years. My charges were 1 count dwelling/prowling, 1 count petty theft, 1 count larc grand of firearm, and 1 count or Burglary of an unoccupied conveyance.

La Archidiócesis de México recomienda a las mujeres católicas que, para evitar agresiones sexuales, no usen "ropa provocativa" ni entren en "pláticas o chistes picantes" con personas del otro sexo, según informaron este jueves fuentes del organismo. La recomendación forma parte de una ficha sobre valores dedicada al pudor como material preparatorio previo al VI Encuentro Mundial de las Familias, que se celebrará en México en enero de 2009.         El sacerdote recuerda que el cuerpo humano "es obra de Dios" "Si quieres evitar una agresión sexual... No uses ropa provocativa... Cuida tus miradas y tus gestos... No te quedes sola con un hombre, aunque sea conocido... No permitas familiaridades de tus amigos o parientes... No admitas pláticas o chistes picantes... Busca ayuda cuando sospeches una mala intención...", se?ala la ficha.      ?No os parece que al decir esto es como si justificasen las agresiones sexuales a las mujeres que se visten libremente como les da la gana?      ?Acaso la mujer debe renunciar a su libertad para evitar a tanto salido sexual que pulula por el mundo?       http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/405818/0...

If so No soldier should ever have to stand court martial ever again because civil trials are different than military trials just as civil and military crimes are different and the people are held to different standards.  Do you agree or disagree?       http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/11/10/...

20081112201715AAuNp3w	Politics & Government;Politics	What would you think of this proposal?	Here's something I've been thinking to myself ever since it became apparent that Hillary was running for president a few years back...   Things have changed since the Constitution was written.  They never foresaw women having all the rights they now have...women didn't even have a role in government.  Of course, that has completely changed since the 18th century.  However...the way the Constitution was written, they made a way to make changes to it.  Which is why blacks are free, and women can now vote.   Fast forward to present times...   When Bill Clinton took office, I strongly believe that Hillary was at work with him.  And with that line of thought, I didn't think she should be allowed to be president again, since she already had 8 years co-piloting Bill's 2 terms (or if you want to think this way, like a lady I know, SHE was the one running the country while Bill was doing his 'hanky-panky').  So here is the proposal...      No spouse of a president can themselves run for president if their spouse has served the max allowed by the Constitution.      What are your thoughts on a proposal like this?
20081111130822AAoDsNx	Politics & Government;Elections	Republicans, if you have this amazing ability to predict the future, and know that Obama will be a failure as ?	President, why didn't you let us all know there were no WMD in Iraq?  Why didn't you let us all know the economy was going to tank months ago?  Why didn't you make sure the GOP would nominate someone who could actually win? Why didn't you foretell of Palin's drag on the ticket? Why did you predict much of the same gloom and doom in 1992 and it did not come to pass?  Just curious.

20081106200205AAUUQAa	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What is our greatest enemy as a country?	I believe it is Liberalism. Terrorism is a distant second. I can see how we will win over terrorism, but it is less clear how we will win against Liberalism. I believe defeating Liberalism is the most important thing we can do to pass on a better world to our kids.      Anyone else agree?

20081104065501AA7a2lD	Politics & Government;Elections	Has there ever been a President with fewer qualifications than Obama?	I've seen JFK mentioned, but he was both a Representative and a Senator for Massachusetts, plus military experience before he ran.        I've seen Bush mentioned, but he was a two term governor of Texas and ran several corporations prior to running.      I've seen Eisenhower mentioned, but he commanded the Allied Forces during WWII.      I've seen Lincoln mentioned, but he was both a state and congressional representative for Illinois and had spent over 30 years in politics and the legal profession prior to running.      How is it that someone with as short a list of achievements as Obama is about to be elected President of the most powerful country in the history of the world?

20081107142702AADdKgR	Politics & Government;Elections	Does the electoral college really make sense?	The whole idea of the electoral college was to give even small states an equal say in the election of the president. However, this past election got me thinking if it really does matter when you consider that it takes several small states to equal a larger one (elec vote wise), and the smaller states further west had not even finished voting when Obama was already being declared winner. (**This is not an attack on Obama- this has nothing to do with WHO was elected, just the process of the electoral college.)
