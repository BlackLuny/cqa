WTzVgZciaa	this is a very serious case but you should be very proud for wanting to change and understanding the imortance. having a parent who ignores the real issue can be very difficult but you cannt let her ways or anyone's opinion get in the way of your health and happiness. i suggest walking it is actually healthier and rather than eating 3 meals eat smaller portions throughout the day to keep your metabolism flowing, drink lots of water. not eating at all only makes it worse. when you return to the doctor consider confiding in them and explaining your situation. youre right it doesnt seem like your mom understands  but you cant let that get to you and if your mom is a hard person to talk to maybe you can talk with someone else dont be embarassed or anything like that because for you to be brave enough to talk about it they cant help but respect you. good luck. and please dont ever give up.|`|hMXJ1VSVaa	Hey, I'm home-schooled too! =) <br>  Try Wii Fit and Dance Dance Revolution (If you have a Wii/Xbox/PS2 etc.) - fun and exercise! =] <br>  <br>  Squats are easy to do if you're just standing there too lol =)|`|C1imDsmbaa	i agree with #1. and yes, i think your mom should care and help you to acheive greatness (losing weight). This is a serious health problem and you need to take action whether your mother cares or not. And yes I know you've been trying, but don't let it stop you! Next time you see your doctor ask to make regular appointments just to do things that will help you lose weight.<br>  <br>  Ask other family members for help also.|`|EEfd3WLhaa	You need to flat out tell her, "Mom, if you don't start getting me healthier foods...it is going to KILL me."  She may realize that she is doing you harm then.  If not go to another family member or adult friend (teacher, neighbor, etc) you can trust and try to explain the situation to them.  If your school has a nurse or guidance councler, maybe talk to them and have them talk to your mom.  You sound like you really do want to get healthy and that's the first step.  If your mom doesn't want to help in this then maybe look into moving in with someone else in your family who can treat you how you need.|`|OjyjLAp9aa	i thnk that your best option is to ask help from someone other than your mother. like a grandparent, or even when the next time you go to see the doctor. ask them for help, and try to do as much as you can with excercising, it does help. just keep going. <br>  im only 15 too. i know the struggles of teenage life. <br>  i may not be overweight, but i know a lot. ive been thru so much in my life it seems like a story. but anyway. <br>  you need to ask someone for help. <br>  OTHER than your MOM. because if it comes down to life and death your mother will be sorry to lose you. go grocery shopping with her. even if it looks funny. look up healty foods online, like maybe bananas, ask your mom to buy bananas, so when you run to excercise, you wont get leg cramps. or evenwhen you excercise, take your ipod or an mp3 player, a CD player, something with music to help take your mind off anypain. and if you still feel it sing. it helps.|`|VquZAwfHaa	I'm older then you, and I didn't start having issue with my weight until I was in my early 20's, however, I have a few suggestions for you. <br>  <br>  Does your area have a free swimming pool? If so, start going to the pool and swimming laps for at least a half hour at a time whenever you can. Swimming is great exercise for your whole body, and it doesn't seem like its as much work as it really is. You'll be sore afterward, but you'll also see your weight dropping if you put some effort into it. You may need to go early in the morning for the pool to be available to do laps.<br>  <br>  Walk everywhere you can. If you go to the store with friends, park far away and walk to across the whole parking lot. Go for a walk every day- walking for an hour will burn about 300 calories as long as you're not dragging along. <br>  <br>  I understand the food problem. My Mom shops the same way. Just try to eat as much fresh fruits and veggies as you can, and see which of those ready-to-heat foods are the least bad for you. Some stuff is no where near as bad as others. Also, learn about portion control. Most of us eat portions that are about twice the size of what a real portion should be. You might feel hungry for a week, but you'll get used to it, and it'll get easier. <br>  <br>  And drink LOTS of water! Often when we are thirsty, we mistake it for hunger pains so we eat instead. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps at least a little!|`|WUzUcebkaa	wow okay heres the thing hun....to me she dont give a shi* im sorry to say ! i know how u feel with her not careing i feel the same with my family alot but im no where like this in my life....let me tell u not eating is not the way to go! wat to do is call this number 1 800 668 6868 u have to hun its the only way helping your self i<br>  <br>  you need the help you or trying to get if ur own mom dont care then its up 2 u to help ur self ya i know ya only 15 but sometimes parent (s) dont understand us kids at all! im 16 my self be 17 in 25 days sometimes its like i just wanna give up on life so bad <br>  <br>  eating is not the way out of it please if you ever need anything hun let me know ight <br>  i would gave ya my number but dont wanna post it on here so email me sometime rgustafson2@verizon.net|`|kNYDHZqAaa	It makes me sad to hear that your mother doesn't seem to care about your weight problem - she really should. Maybe she is overweight as well, and she doesn't want to acknowledge your weight problem because then she would have to address her own problem. <br>  <br>  Keep up with the running and going for walks. If your mother doesn't want to enroll you in sports, that's the best, cheapest and easiest way to work out. If a cop stops you again, just tell him/her that you are exercising and don't worry about it. It sounds to me like your mom is neglecting you, and if you are really frustrated and scared, you might want to talk to someone at Child Protective Services. At the very least, take some comfort in that you are almost 18, and you can get out of the house and take control of your life. It's good that you are motivated to change, hang on to that motivation!! Keep your chin up.|`|4wXPHANBaa	Dear please dont worry. I know how you are feeling. But be strong, you can reduce weight gradually, just be positive.<br>  <br>  Sometimes out parents, have a lot going on their minds. Your Mom could be having some of her won problems, so be nice to her and ask her if everything is all right. Tell her that you love her. Then explain how you are feeling about all this. Do not cry, just talk with her and see how it goes.<br>  <br>  I know we can lose weight. Only it would be hard in the beginning. Once you started losing it, you will be okay.|`|OlTuytNVaa	Honestly, it sounds like you are just going to have to find a part time job that is close to your home so you can walk there if you don't have a car and start buying some of your own groceries and clothes. I know it sucks but having a job and getting the money to have the freedom to make those choices sounds like your only option right now. You could also try to plant a garden with fresh veggies and fruits and stuff and that would help with some of the grocery cost.|`|oOBmPYplaa	First of all, I'm sorry that your mother will not take time to understand your concern. <br>  Although it is difficult at first, try to maintain a portion control when eating whatever your family does provide. Also, to avoid eating as much "crap", when you feel hungry, drink a glass of water before eating anything. <br>  As far fitness is concerned, you CAN progress to a fit level without a gym or fancy equipment. <br>  1) I do not know what your schedule is like but try going for a walk every day. START AT SHORT DISTANCES! For the first week, try just a 1/4 mile, then the next week, a 1/2 mile, the next 3/4 of a mile, etc. You can use google pedometer to find how far a mile is near where you live. CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE IS THE BEST FACTOR OF YOUR HEALTH THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE IN YOUR CONDITION!!<br>  2) try sit-ups. Even if you can only do 1 or 2, gradually increase the amount as time progresses.<br>  3) Try push-ups too (same rules as above)<br>  <br>  Remember: It takes 2 weeks for something to become a habit.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  I hope this helps|`|7wkHVaNyaa	She may have eating issues also. I'm going to guess she is over weight also. Also could be a way for her to keep you as her baby. Maybe she afraid to loose you. Bottom line is hun, exercises, It takes more than just eating healthy foods. Start asking people if you can walk their dogs for money or mow their lawn, rake their leaves. You get the idea, but you need to earn some money so that you can buy the foods that are good for you, if she isn't. You need to train yourself not to get full on things like chips. Make half a tuna sand. instead. Drink water instead of soda etc... Educate yourself on what is good food and bad food and start exercising, walking riding bikes, but get a routine down. Don't let her hold you back, you can make the changes yourself. She is only an excuse|`|WGebRhqyaa	well first of all you have a lot of problems w/your mother. i think you need to see a counselor. go to a local free health bureau & speak to someone there so they can try to get you help. or go to the doctors & speak to a doctor there & maybe they can get you some help. its very sad that your mom acts this way about her child & dont think she cares at all. i hope you seek help asap!|`|NqWl2qlPaa	I am a mother of four and the way you're describing your mother is appalling, I can't believe a woman could be that way to their own child, if I was you I would call the child abuse line and report her, you are only three years away from freedom, and if you don't act quickly, considering the way you described your health, you may not make it that long.  What does your father say? Is he around? Can you live with him? You bring up such good points especially about homeschooling and not getting physical activity.  My husbandand I homeschooled, and as a family/physical activity we used to go out and play some ball games or we would go bike riding as a family, or even go for a walk.  I hte to say it, but your mom needs serious psychological help, especially if you are begging for her help and she is refusing.|`|cuNdAE3Daa	i think that you should try and phone some one about your mum treating you in this way because it sounds like she's treating you like crap for her own pleasure try asking your GP for advice on how to loose weight and different diets that would be suitable for you there are many exercises that you could do at home like push ups star jumps sit ups and even buy yourself some weights maybe. if you feel uncomfortable doing these in front of your mum then try to join the local gym and maybe talk to your dad about your problems.<br>  hope this helps<br>  xxmwah|`|dV6nEBUdaa	im sorry to hear everything you just mention<br>  but your mom is the one to blame <br>  your mom is supposed to support you<br>  idk what to tell you but try doing it for yourself <br>  go out for walks and you do need to eat<br>  you have to sit he down and tell her how you feel and tell her how little she is caring for you<br>  are you an only child?<br>  hope you feel better|`|pOTigVYPaa	Here's your chance to finally be in control of something.  You can't control your Mom or her actions but you can control yours.  But no excuses.  I too have had weight issues but currently am doing quite well and have lost a few pounds and my clothes are fitting better.  Here's what I am doing:  Make a few changes at a time.  Don't look at it like it's all or nothing.  I started drinking 8 glasses of water a day which was difficult at first but you can buy Crystal lite and add it to your water for flavor and only 5 added calories.  I have recently quit eating all  meat except for fish and seafood, the reason being that I have found myself pigging out on fried chicken, seconds on pork chops etc. and eating only a small portion of vegetables.  For good health and weight loss it should be just the opposite:  Lots of vegetables, salads and fruit, and small portions of meat.  So now I am eating lots of salads, fruit and vegetables and filling up on that with very few calories, and eating fish, and beans and cheese for my protein.  I'm losing weight so easily and I don't exercise.  I'm feeling better day by day and figure than in another month or two with a little more weight loss I'll start walking and doing 10 minutes of exercising at home.  It's simple and it works.  Give it a try.  Don't give up on yourself.  I think your mother has but remember:  This is something that you have control over. Not your Mom.

It doesn't sound like it's awkward between your friend and him, so there probably an outer cause that's affecting his actions.  Tell your friend that he'll get over it and come around.  But if he doesn't and he is still acting differently toward other people, try to find out what's up.  It could even be that he might need help, because he sounds depressed, but don't tell your friend that because most likely she'll try to figure out what's wrong and then he'll most likely just start yelling at her that nothing is wrong.

And if I didnt want to be alone, I'd embrace her comfort.  <br>  <br>  If he does say that he wants to be alone though, you should definitely give him his space.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	let him alone but keep checking on him like every thirty minutes, so he knows you are there for him if he needs you|`|438f473be46cc5289e5c24b78adac392aa	Honestly its different with every guy...I would personally like to be left alone so that i can vent and get the upset-ness out of my system. But like i said every guy is different.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Tell him that you're there if he needs you, but if he'd prefer to left alone then to just let you know. If he wants to be left alone, then leave him alone!|`|EC9UkAQmaa	Just tell him your there when he needs to get it off his chest.Then tell him where he can find when he's ready.|`|vX2O4v7haa	yes<br>  <br>  solitude is the best medicine|`|ZZkInusMaa	most men doo lol !! you know wat they are like LOL !!|`|qnMUwYfHaa	no i hate that cuz then i start thinking too much|`|9vccbqrVaa	Yes!|`|kEtYEmhqaa	No, I prefer sex.  That can cure just about anything.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	All you need to do is ask, can i do anything and if he says no, leave it alone!|`|dbXnW5emaa	I only want to be alone if I'm upset at the person I'm usually with....my wife.  But if the problem is something unrelated to her I value her advice.  I might still want to be alone afterwards, but I at least want to know what she thinks.|`|CBgDc1Auaa	Yes... definitely.... at least until I'm ready to talk about it...<br>  <br>  that's what a lot of woman don't get... it's not that we don't want to talk about our feelings, it's just that we have to mull it over in our own heads for a while first...<br>  <br>  ya know?|`|y9CgveCGaa	Just let him know you'll listen if he wants to talk.  I like to cool down before I talk about something tough.   Don't talk his not talking as a sign of anything negative in your relationship.|`|AA11922229	No, we are tough and can take it, so, we suck it up.|`|QxtdyNvgaa	yes i am a boy and when i am upset i prefer to be left alone.<br>  we like to think about it and then when we are over it we return back to normal!<br>  <br>  i was upset today.............................|`|1VvKdQMNaa	I like to talk about stuff and not be in the dark.

If she was the love of your life you'd still be together. Couples who are meant to be work through their problems they do not 'split' that shows something is fundamentally wrong with the relationship. You need to get out there, get new hobbies and interests and you'l soon look back and think actually maybe it wasn't all that great.|`|JXFYdTqmaa	firstly im sorry, and i know you might not think it now, but time will heal.<br>  you need to think about the reasons you broke up, and if its something you cant change then its time to move on...life is too short to get down. <br>  <br>  if you love her give your self time to heal abit and then ask if you can take her for a meal so you can talk....tell her its not to get back together...but to fix the way things were left, and you never know it might just be the fix of you.<br>  <br>  good luck and im sorry ur feeling so down.|`|4JHvjk2Uaa	Sorry that happens... People tend to split up. Just calm down, and if you REALLY can't stop being with her then just try coo her back into liking you. Otherwise find someone else, I'm sure you could find someone as good as her if you tried.|`|beHhzLQSaa	keep going on. dont think of it as a bad thing, you have memories of that. think to yourself, at least i experienced that relationship. theres still time and women to meet, get out there and find someone, i know you will.|`|uJlivxQXaa	go to the senior center and tell her u love her :-p jkk but yea just tell her|`|4VjGwauQaa	whoa, let me guess you used to be married too huh?

0tpLq6meaa	Hi Annie. Your 18. Is the reason you don't move in with your boyfriend is because you don't wish to leave your little brother and can't take care of him if you leave? I can understand the situation you are in. My heart goes out to you. It seems like that I've read so many of your questions and answers on Yahoo, it seems like it's happening to someone in my family.Wish there was some great advice I could give you, but just don't know what you could do, other then leave. I hope you can put up with his rants and not say or do anything that would get you hurt.. I'm sure you would already have gone, if not for worrying about what would happen to your brother, without you there to take care of him.Just remember this- all things change at some point or another. There will be a time when you will be out of the house, and wont have to worry about the abuse you are suffering from now.And one day it will all be a bad memory.I will say a prayer for you tonight. Good luck!|`|ujIinLzGaa	I suggest you turn him in to your state's Child Protective Services.  Period.  They will probably have a talk with him that only they can have.  If that doesn't work, call them again.  If you want to talk to me about this, please feel free to email me.  I wish you the best of luck, and I assume you will move out ASAP?|`|nooi0ldjaa	it sounds like he is feeding off of you getting mad and sad.<br>  like he is doing it just to screw with you. easier said then done but try to just ignore him, don't say a word or even look at him when he starts up. don't show your tears.<br>  and if he puts his hands on you, knee him in the nuts.<br>  put him to the ground (trust me, a knee to the nuts well do that!) but only if he touches you first, and someone see's it and is willing to back up your story. show him your done and not putting up with his bullshit anymore.<br>  <br>  or...keep calling the cops.<br>  or...put up with it...<br>  <br>  im sorry, and your right its not normal, and you should not have to put up with a slob like him (no offense) nor should your brother. <br>  <br>  best of luck, and if he cant man up, maybe you should.<br>  teach him who's boss :D kick some old man azz!|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	Actually, I think this is rather normal behavior.  And I am GLAD you feel your life is screwed-up...and here's why.<br>  <br>  I had an older sister and brother growing-up.  I was amazed that when they left home to go to college, they basically stayed away.  During summer breaks, they either took additional summer college courses or they worked AWAY from home.<br>  <br>  I sort of went back to the nest after college...but not for long.  I suddenly realized why my older siblings left home as soon as possible; my parents would drive us crazy.  Perhaps not the same kind of craze that your dad puts you through...but pretty close!<br>  <br>  These days, too many kids are babied by their parents.  That's just wrong.  For many many years, it was a right of passage for kids to try to get the heck out of their homes as soon as they could.  But nowadays, parents want to be their "buddies" and they baby them well into their twenties.  It's not unusual for single pregnant girls, ages 18 to 26 are living with mom or dad.  The heck with that!<br>  <br>  So, good for your parents and good for you.  You might think I am being harsh and that I don't understand. But believe me, I understand better than you do right now!  It's time to leave the nest!|`|GcOWoAmSaa	My dad was a drunk too and he was sometimes mean. He put me through lots of crap like your dad is doing, but now I have my life together. When you get your drivers license and get a job you will be able to get away from him. Just hang in there for now and remember that God loves us. Never give up on yourself. You will be better than what you might think.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Dang this is tough but it is time to report him. Where is your Mom in all this. Is she alive? If not then it is time to talk to your brother because both of you may be physically in danger.  People who act like this have reached the point where personality is fragmenting and Jack the Ripper may manifest. It is time to put a stop to this Call the Child Protective Services for your county and report him. Also call local Sheriff and ask how you can get a restraining order against him. They will make him move out until you graduate. If I can help any any way send me an E-mail. It is time to get defensive for yourself and your brother.  Make the reports even if your brother does not like it.|`|urs9AxiGaa	This is soooooo typical..... Men always take out their frustrations on others. Unlike women who take their frustration out on themselves. <br>  I HATE dads like that...... verbally and physically abusive. Your father has a lot of problems with anger management and depression. He needs a LOT of help.   <br>  <br>  There are 4 options<br>  <br>  Option 1.) I know its easier said then done, but maybe its just better if you start looking for colleges that have dorms. Or just finding another place to live entirely. I know financially it maybe out of the question, and you probably don't want to leave you 11 year old brother with Mr. Hot head......but maybe its for the best, just to leave everything behind.  <br>  <br>  Option 2.) You can call the cops on his *** or child services.<br>  <br>  Option 3.) Or you can play mind games with him, and just threaten that going to do # 2 if he doesn't clean himself up.<br>  <br>  Option 4.) Beef up and show him who's boss (Mentally and Physically, by trying to maintain your composure) <br>  <br>  As for the insults he always saying to you, its just better to ignore it. I know its hard but the only reason he saying such things is b/c he's trying degrade you, and make you feel little. DON'T GIVE HIM THOSE PRIVILEGES REMOVE THEM ENTIRELY, BY BRUSHING EVERYTHING HE SAYS OFF.<br>  <br>  IF YOU NEED TO TALK CONTACT ME BY E-MAIL<br>  GOOD LUCK.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	im sorry i sorta know how you feel my parents went thro a divorce and they toke it all out on me so i moved out and stayed on the river for a year by myself it was terrible .........im so sorry|`|4QHanq1Laa	thats so crazy how similiar you are to me when it comes to our dads... <br>  I wrote my dad a letter with my cell number, i left and stayed at a friends house and waited for me to call him when he was ready things are a bit better now. <br>  <br>  im sorry for u :(|`|WQbshcb1aa	i totally understand how you feel! <br>  my dad is an alcholic majorly and he is the same way ever since i was little he is abusive mentaly verbally and physically my mom moved us kids to a different state when he wouldnt stop drinking then he promised not to and my mom took him back and he does it still all the time we have spent so much money and time into his childness behaviors and acohol is absolutly no exscuse ever. <br>  and i have spent my days crying and shaking so bad because of him and sometimes i wish he would die. IM only 16 i have two more years with this @$$ and tell him how you feel i know it doesnt work and they think they are always right and your the one with attitudes and stuff totally understand but its ridiculous i think your best bet is to wait untill you go to college just think about it, i know its tuff but if you have made it this far you can wait a couple more months and get out of there and for your license thing your 18 have a friend drive you up there and get it all you need is money and your social security number, getting that might make you feel a little more free from him untill college! people go thro this stuff all the time it will be okay! i know he gets on your nerves and if i was the one backing up in the truck & he was standing there i would have pulled forward and hit him in reverse (no offense) if you got good friends and semi good family youll make it. just try to spend most of your home time out of your home and if he yells at you while your driving slam on the breaks get out and start walking. again he will probably yell at you and call you stupid or stuff but you shouldnt have to deal with that at all! when you think its your breaking point its really not, when you break you'll know! your best bet is to just wait but if your seriously worried and have tried everything then its time to call the police because your bro is only 11 so he has what 7 more years their. all in all its totally up to you what you do, you are the one that has to make the decision. i dont know if i helped any but if you ever want to talk you can email me!! <br>  ~good luck|`|eF8QOIddaa	Wheres your mother honey and dont cry its ok im here to help just ignore him go in your room and lock the door and dont listen to him and if hes beating you call a cop if it gets serious but overall hold him off until you get a place to stay or if you and your boyfriend are serious enough well your18 move in and dont worry about your hot tempered father|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look just calm down, if you want to be better then yelling is counter productive. I promise you that. Regardless, call an intervention hot-line they are in your phonebook and ask what to do they know how best to deal with situations like this. <br>  <br>  Personally if I were you I would hold on for a few more months until college and get out. Talk to your boyfriend and see if you two can room together and pray because that is all you will have to live on. This seems to be more of a pattern than I originally realized. Email me and maybe I can help you figure out a solution.
XQa3CQJ0aa	Im 16 now and Ive grown up with this kind of stuff the only reason why this girl is doing this is maybe because 'seth' is one of her ex boyfriend who she still really likes and is jelous because he likes another girl 'you'.<br>  <br>  The only way you can solve this is if you talk to him about the whole situation about her interfering and making up lies and pretending to me him and it is really hurting you now because you are deeply comfused. You shouldnt listen to the girl trying to tell you to stay away from him, he isn't her boyfriend and she doesn't own him so there for she can't stop you!<br>  <br>  Tell this boy that you want to know when its achaully 'him' on his profile and not her maybe ask him for his phone number and text each other or the best solution is to ask him to change his password! or maybe even ask him if you could make a secret word up so when he logs on and wants to talk to you he has to say that secret word like 'rainbow' or something like that and then you definetly know its him and if you're still not convinced and think shes found out your secret word as him a personal question that only you might now and if he answers correctly it definetly is him!...<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|0HydJEmgaa	the best way to handle this is to go and talk to seth face to face about  it because the internet has never been safe maybe she can open his account or something anyway in my opinion is to talk to Seth about everything because i think he knows something about her, if he told u <br>  "stay away from her"<br>  good luck!|`|rSA29N3daa	Well.. what i would thinks is yes this girls is kinda jealous ..atleast thats what it seems like and maybe she likes this guy seth but has a boyfriend too(it could happen).. so i think that you should try and talk to seth i mean you dont have anything to lose really and if you just dont want to do that try and talk to him pesronally like on the phone or in person ya know..best of luck :)|`|AA11530601	she must fancy him or maybe she just likes being mean<br>  <br>  <br>  either way...dont stop messaging him, and if she gets mad its not as if she can stop you.

XQa3CQJ0aa	Okaii Im guessing your around my age 16? And I did have this problem with one of my old girl friends Megan around a year ago.<br>  <br>  The best solution is to talk to your teacher and tell her/him that he is really starting to irratate you and you just wanted to let her/him know incase she tried to set you up as partners for an experiment or something!<br>  <br>  It sounds as though he is a 'show off' and he thinks thats he is 'cool' because hes never learned otherwise, he may know that the whole class hates him and because you are his friend he thinks that he can treat you in whichever manner he pleases to.<br>  <br>  Just talk to him and tell him that the way he is behaving is really starting to annoy you, explain to him that you are his friend and you will be pleasent to him but he has to stop his attitude and his manner towards you and towards other people, tell him that the way hes acting is causing other people and yourself not to like him anymore...<br>  <br>  The only way out is to be truthful...<br>  <br>  Hope I helped x|`|JSakTuOHaa	OK this is what you do. You don't HAVE to be his friend.. But you also dont have to be mean. Be friendly. Be mature about it. Don't talk behind his back just be indifferent towards him You sound young so i dont know if you know what that means..<br>  <br>  Just be friendly.. If he tries talking to you be pleasent. <br>  <br>  Its not hard.|`|8gyaS3mGaa	he sounds annoying but have some sympathy for him, since he has no friends. tell him why you are agravated and ask him to stop. if he refuses then tell him that if he does not then you won't be friends, if he still doesn't shape up then ignore him and just don't hang out with him any more.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Tell your teacher he's irritating and then she will find a solution for you.|`|meeKeLxvaa	OMG i know 2 ppl similar to that<br>  i would tell him how i feel and stop communicating with him...|`|zKLl9iSHaa	tell him that you don't want to be friends with him anymore... problem solved :) <3|`|seqEdwwnaa	dont talk to him...ever again
Hk39AkNGaa	Strike up a small conversation. This will help you learn little things that will come in handy in the future. All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot. <br>  <br>  Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you. <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself.<br>   <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name. <br>  Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her. <br>  <br>  Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction. <br>  <br>  Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you. <br>  Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you. <br>  <br>  Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you. <br>  Hallway If you see her walking down the hallway, she'll look at you once, quickly. She'll probably smile, but you know, try to contain it. <br>  <br>  I really hope i helped you !|`|bTLwhwR3aa	Were pretty Obvious!<br>  lol touch your shoulder a little while talking<br>  she smiles alt at you<br>  she looks in at you and in your direction alot<br>  she also..can be a shy girl ((like i am)) and she'll just simply smile and HOPE you will talk to her first...|`|258mrT2Paa	she will grab your balls and squeeze hard.|`|v3tw6uubaa	Well the first sign that a girl likes you is if she smiles at you and blushes when you look back or when she looks at you.The next sign its almost a definite, she does like you when she preforms the perfume walk by after she sprays herself with some sweet smelling perfume.the next sign that a girl likes you is if she walks over by you and drops whatever shes carrying and see if you pick it up.Then she'll ask you if she knows you.BAM you know she likes you!!!!!!!!!!! o_O|`|qXA3RjIbaa	Well when i like someone i stare at them a lot and since im really shy when i look at them i wish they could talk to me first|`|C1imDsmbaa	need ta be a little more specific there, but yeah #2 sounds pretty good.
AA10986891	Probably you have a very strong personality. You are right unless you are proven otherwise, that can be intimidating to some people cause they don't have debating skills or knowledge to debate.
mJo35PwXaa	im as straight in romance as they come and i fail cause of it!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	You have to play the 'game' at least a little bit.  I'm not going to show my entire hand too early on.  I'm not going to back the girl in a corner too early on.  You have to be somewhat smart about you how you do things or you risk scaring the girl off.|`|6oZagLCvaa	heck yeah we do,,, its GAME ON until we get the booty|`|AA10916761	only when there not sure about if she's is playing the same game|`|20NGQtCbaa	We play a game called "Whoever finishes first has to sleep on the wet spot"
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if its no longer happening, and things are better i would just keep my eyes wide open, and try to focus on what u have with him. just don't put up with any crap if he starts wanting to see this girl, or going out without u, u will know there is something not right.|`|ev33OxJbaa	Lose him fast. He has issues and its not your fault. You need to dump him and move on. Do yourself a favor and have some respect for yourself. This relationship is doomed.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	If it was only in the beginning, then I wouldn't care or worry anymore.<br>  See if it was just when he had first met you and just started dating you, then of course he was probaly still hooked on her a bit. You said that they lost their 'V' to each other, so they did have some bonding there. And in the beginning he didn't real know you yet.<br>  <br>  I'm sure since he's still with you now, that you are the one he loves. And she isn't anything to him anymore. Just be happy in your relationship, and enjoy it. <br>  <br>  Best wishes!!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If he hasn't gotten rid of the pics - especially keeping them on his phone (WTF?) then don't bother getting back together.  You all sound like you're about 16 years old...<br>  <br>  Add:  At 22 girl - run!  Run far away!  There are plenty of other guys out there that don't pull this kind of garbage.  Don't look back and don't feel guilty.  You don't want to live your life being 2nd best...|`|W2R8TRDmaa	From a guys perspective, I would tell you to not necessarily be upset by this.  Guys will always crave to see nude photos of girls regardless of how great their current relationship is.  We're just wired that way and don't take it personally.|`|AA11596133	YES, and I refused to play second fiddle, and refused to tolerate it, so I sent him packing.  WHY waste your energy or time with anyone who lives in the past.  They are NOT on the same plane as any of us who live in the present.|`|TPhIWWniaa	I'm sorry but I've never been in a situation like this, but even if I loved the guy to death I couldn't put up with the fact that he wanted to see his ex while he was with me.  I would wonder why they broke up then!?|`|ivsYJPx3aa	I can't wait to see , . Sounds good! ...There is no chance of that.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, you know if the guy is very confused you should just tell him straight up how you feel, make sure it does not form any type of argument, just be really careful & I do not want you to get hurt and some relationships are NOT even worth it, you know. I hope you understand that, if a guy, just argues what are you trying to convey, he is not comprehending, it is not right, he should respect you!
74tr4nYeaa	just say hey whatz been goin on then start talking about school and stuff!!!!!|`|mzH7wV6maa	Just say Hi and compliment them on something ( anything really - their hair, their clothes etc.) Talk a bit about how long it has been since you have seen them and everything that's happened since then. Conversation should start to happen then. xx<br>  <br>  If all else fails, talk about the weather. :)|`|oFeNwMheaa	omg, i hve the same problems, its so awkward when i see them, im like wat do i say the same boring stuff hws educations?|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Ask them questions that way you get them to do most of the talking. Be really interested in their answers, it helps.<br>  <br>  "Hey what you been up to?"<br>  "I learnt to surf since you last saw me"<br>  "Really, I would love to learn to surf, when can you teach me?"<br>  "Anytime, just call me"<br>  "Cool, catch you later"
FZKFLTyLaa	3 has an understated elegance that somehow also seems to match your personality.<br>  You are lovely, even when clowning around!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	1- very dramatic and I like the color but keep in mind the back will not look all smooth like that at your wedding.  it'll be bustled most of the day so you won't get that spread out effect<br>  2- too white, but I like the way it wraps in both the front and the back<br>  3-I'm a big fan of understated dresses without the big petticoat thing underneath.  I think poofy dresses look outdated very quickly when you look back on your wedding photos in a few years<br>  4-I can see you like that wrap effect at the waist ;)  this dress would be very elegant and dramatic at the bust without any straps at all or sleeves.  this one's my favorite.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	<a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?page=32&style=A557" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a> - LOVE THE COLOR.. I love Maggie dresses... I love the rouching, and I love the beads across the chest... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?page=22&style=J1067" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a> - I love the back of this... It's just a tad different than the traditional, but that's about it :(  It's just a little too plain I guess.. I don't know.. I can't put my finger on it... he he..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?page=25&style=AD1008" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a> - Not a fan...  Perfect if you are getting married on the beach though, but it almost looks "cheap"... :(<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?page=32&style=A546" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a> - I actually LOVE the cap sleeves!!  But, this dress will look good with the thinner ones too.  It's very similar to the first one...  I love it.<br>  <br>  You have great taste, bottom line.  My vote is for #1 then #4 in second place.  I absolutely love the "light gold" in #1...  It's a flattering color...  <br>  Personally, I think you will look great in any of them :)  gorgeous|`|4POGapREaa	I like #2 the best because the gathering is so beautiful & I love the details in the back.  My least favorite is #1.  It's just a bit too huge for me.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	My order is 4, 3, 1, 2. <br>  <br>  #4 (Destin)- I like the straps that it has but it would also look nice with thinner straps if that's what you prefer.  I like everything about it.  <br>  #3 (AD1008)- I like the skirt on this one.  <br>  #1(Michelle)- I like the style of this one but I think I'd prefer it in white.  I love the encrusted bodice. <br>  #2 (Donyella)- This is my least favorite. The way the fabric is gathered across the front looks messy compared to the gathering on the other dresses.|`|F4k68ilkaa	I vote for either #1 or #3.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	Dress Number 2 for SURE! Oh, it's gorgeous. The fabric looks so light and ethereal, and the asymmetrical lines are really interesting, and I am crazy about the back of the gown-which is really crucial, since really, the guests are looking at the back of your dress for a lot of the day! <br>  <br>  It's fantastic. And with your coloring, it will really look crisp and you'll look unbelievable!<br>  <br>  The other ones pale in comparison to #2!|`|rzPIO1aQaa	dress one is beautiful and I do not like any of the other ones. Dress 2 is pretty but not as eye popping as dress one. I am also not much for dresses that you can not breath in like dress 3. Dress 4 was just blah. I say dress one but its your choice and I hope you get your perfect dress. Congrats. Also you are beautiful.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	You need to go to a bridal salon and try these dresses on to really know.  Even something of a similar style will give you a better idea than just a picture on an airbrushed model.<br>  <br>  Based on the pictures of the gowns this one is my favourite: <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?page=32&style=A546" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a><br>  <br>  And I think you should leave those straps on. I really like them.  But if you prefer something else then go for it!  You'll be wearing it, not me. lol|`|s9Uufsr0aa	Best:  dress 3 -classy, elegant, will show your hour glass figure, not too heavy for the beach<br>  <br>  Least Fav:  dress 2 - not a fan of the clip or flower type thing that holds in the synch at the waist|`|8IA3d3NNaa	the first and the fourth are my favorites, the first coming in at number one and the fourth by a close second, good luck on whatever you decide.<br>  <br>  You are VERY pretty too, i'm jealous.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I think height should always play a factor in the style of dress chosen by a girl.  If you consider yourself short, I would go with AD1008.  If you can pull off something poufier, then go with Michelle.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Dresses 1 and 3 are my favorites out of those.|`|7CKipTZOaa	They are all gorgeous but 4 is my favorite because it is just so elegant and classic, I prefer its ruching more so than the others it just seems to fall into place better|`|gpL7W3jAaa	My dress is a maggie too. Anyway, they are all beuatiful. I think I'm torn between dress 2 and 3. They're so different from each other but both very unique and pretty. Dress 3 would probably work a bit better for a beach wedding...but dress 2 might be better for your body type.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck with your decision!|`|LxvA4vGpaa	WIth your measurements, you would look stunning in just about any type of dress.  Have you tried on any of the dresses?  That is where I would start....<br>  <br>  Number one:  Love it.  It is a gorgeous, simple gown.  The rouching on the waist will be slimming and will enhance your hourglass figure.  The Champaigne color works well with more skin tones, and will compliment your natural tone nicely.<br>  <br>  2:  I just really don't like it.  The fabric looks like it was stolen from a sleeping bag and i can just hear you running around it and it makes that "swooshing" noise.  I don't know...it is just not my style.  <br>  <br>  3.  Very pretty.....the slim style would compliment your figure quite nicely and the detailing from the right chest down to the left hip would also accent your figure.  I am not sure about the fabric change between the top/bust area and the bottom.  Not my favorite but better than number 2.<br>  <br>  4: I think this one is very similar to number one....same rouching.  same style.  This will give you the princess at the ball type feeling with it.  As long as you have some color to your skin (which you do) you can pull off the bright white without looking like casper.  But to me, the first dress and the champaigne tone makes it look more elegant...more classic.|`|Ieslv5JJaa	For starters, weird faces and all, you are gorgeous! Any dress would look absolutely stunning on you!<br>  <br>  This one is my favorite, I would remove the straps completely though :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?page=32&style=A546" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck, and Congrats!<br>  <br>  ....0....<br>  ..0...0....<br>  .0.....0...<br>  .0.....0.. SUPPORT<br>  ..0...0.........OUR<br>  ...0..0... TROOPS!<br>  ....00.... <br>  ..0....0..<br>  .0......0.|`|bunAXlrXaa	i like dress 1- it is very pretty and i think would go perfectly with your skin tone and hair color, it is very pretty!! i also think t would look the best against a black tux, the white ones just stand out a bit more<br>  i don't like the 4th one- they were all very pretty, but the other dresses are pretty similar, and i like the strapless dresses the best, so this would be the only one out, though it is just as pretty as the others<br>  good luck!!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	How tall are you? I'll add more in a minute here. Still looking at the dresses.<br>  <br>  ADD: Ok, Dress 1. Don't like it. Looks like any other dress from Davids Bridal and not the usual style from Maggie.<br>  2: Love it. A lines are always flattering, the bodice is gorgeous, detail is awesome, I think it would look very well for a beach wedding.<br>  3: My absolute FAVORITE!! Sillouhette is very flattering, looks like something that would look beautiful on a beach, I love the flowiness of it. <br>  4. I like the cap sleeves, because without them it would look absolutely boring.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Torn between dress #2 and #4 with small straps.You are beautiful and would look great ANY dress.Okay I think you would be breathtaking in dress #2 Donyella. It is definitely the BEST dress!Good Luck!|`|rZXQvA75aa	I personally like dress #4 exactly how it is, it's gorgeous. But if you don't like it with the straps then my next favorite is dress #2|`|dA4fXc4Zaa	4 as is its beautiful|`|sGP6s7uraa	Numero 3|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Definitely the first one in white. It's gorgeous.|`|j1k8qGd6aa	Dress number 3...I think that would suit you the most. It's a beautiful dress. Maggie has some nice dresses.|`|pi2Nh6OFaa	The last one for sure!  Very classy and elegant.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	I am sticking with the Donyella one still...|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	One or three, but I really like one.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	The first one is by far my favorite. =) Good luckk|`|Oh75DqReaa	second or third<br>  :D|`|IUYpGvCXaa	I also <3 Maggie dresses & am looking at a few myself.  I think the first one would look the best on you!  I think that it slims the ribcage the most and makes the bust look nice & perky (not that you need that :)   But who wouldn't want either of those things!  Also I think the top sparkles will look  the most beautiful on the beach with the sparkle of the sun & water!  Def. #1!  Good luck!|`|R8VhFeEVaa	On the beach, so you could very well get sand on the bottom of your dress.  I very very much like the first one, because of the gold, but I think you'd look amazing in any of these. I would avoid a train because of the sand. And I think you're dead on, by choosing dresses that give you an hour glass figure with diagonals. You're right about strapless or thin straps too. I don't like the third as much as the others. <br>  <br>  Its going to be so beautiful!!|`|RRqXXG2Taa	the first one it would look great on you and it so pretty and classic elegant sophisticated but yet modern you will look like a princess no matter what dress you wear its your day and have fun i love the first one|`|UPSys1POaa	I personally like the Michelle and Destin & would recommend if you're torn between these two, you base your decision on if you like the strapless look or if you need something else there.|`|1AbaR6Umaa	I really like dress number 3. It looks more like a beach/outside dress. I think it would be a lot lighter then the other three also. Which would be better for a summer wedding. Congrats! And good luck!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	first: I love LOVE love maggie dresses. I think you should go with dress 1 (but I am a bit biased because I am going with the maggie sottero adelaide dress, which is similar to your dress #1). Good luck|`|WQp3uGglaa	Dress number two for sure you'll look great in it.|`|ULzDxJN7aa	I like dress #1 the best!!|`|68MkdEgiaa	I love the first one it's a really nice color. It looks gorgeous! :)|`|sgEIoM5iaa	the first or third one :))

beHhzLQSaa	haha, calm down!<br>  its fine. the situation sounds fine and not embarrasing at all. if he laughed like that would you think bad of him? i shouldnt think so.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Hey whenever people are in love or infatuated, especially young people, they go a little stupid, it's normal.<br>  <br>  What works is if you stop worrying about what he might think of you and just let him see you warts and all, he may like that side of you better anyway.
kwgheTHEaa	To be told that you don't want to be friends with him anymore will hurt him. Imagine someone saying that to you, and you love that person. Doesn't it make your heart ache? Plus, you still want to go out with him right? <br>  <br>  So he says he still likes you. Maybe he's not lying, but he's confused on how YOU feel, like the question you have been asking. Maybe he's also thinking "what is SHE thinking?" <br>  <br>  Try to talk to him again. Ask him straight out what he's thinking, and apologize to him for saying that you don't want to be friends anymore. Confess that you like him and want to go out with him. Then we'll see what happens and if he doesn't want to, then wait it out. Maybe he'll come back again.|`|MrSQJYd6aa	disaster.<br>  <br>  he's thinking that you're a weird girl just like all other girls on this planet and has probably no idea what's going on. well the damage has been done so i'd lay low for awhile and he'll probably come around. whatever you do, do not chase after him. if u told him that u don't want to be friends, stay true to your word. you'l have more respect for yourself if you do and so will he|`|mvVDeL5uaa	well you should hang out with him to get to know him better and when you think he is right for you you ask him out. he is probably thinking that you dont like him or your shy.|`|4wXPHANBaa	Relax and think what do you actually want from all this?

I have been in that situation before. I was so in love with my ex boyfriend and had a boyfriend at the same time. I think that what you could do and if it helps is to sit back and think about which of these two boys brings you more attention and affection. Love doesn't come in a month or two. It's time what makes 2 get to know each other well enough to be in love. You might only be infatuated with your friend. I don't think dumping your boyfriend is such a good Idea, just my opinion.|`|stCqLSSoaa	if u dont like ur boyfriend anymore dumb him dont mess with his herts that not cool|`|ctm4Xmq1aa	follow your heart <br>  its no good when you stick with the one whom you dont trully love|`|vX2O4v7haa	david H <br>  you are my hero!|`|0fXUZ3SRaa	Well you should tell your friend your thinking about dumping your bf for him and he needs to choose between you and the girl you guys work with, if he chooses you then go for it, if he doesnt then stay with your boyfriend and try to make it work.|`|280jfiLOaa	yes or no witchever is better cuz i didn't read it|`|zHrCviSsaa	you should talk with your friend. ask him how he feels. if you both feel awesome about each other go with him and dump the bf. don't waist your time being with someone you don't love the most. its dumb and it wastes your life.|`|WVSpTxuCaa	stay with the guy you are already with becuz if u break upwith him your friend might choose the other girl then u have nobody unless u wanna take a break from dating?|`|keTNfOOhaa	do whatever pleases you the most.<br>  <br>  i had this 1 girlfriend a couple of years ago, then she told me she liked nother guy more and i was just like ok and we ended it. of course i was upset but by the next day i was back to myself|`|StAG45C9aa	If you already like someone that is not your current boyfriend, you should see it as a sign that it is not ment to be.|`|CVk2dWiDaa	Who would you see yourself with in another two years? go with your instincts, dont let people choose for you.

Maybe the other boy  doesn't like you as much as the other girl. besides, maybe the sparks will kindle with your boy-toy. Try it out.|`|UyUZ8Uy6aa	well if you think your relationships worth it then try to make it work,<br>  but if you have these feelings for your friend and he likes you too then maybe that'd work too :D<br>  <br>  but talk to your friend first before you break up with your boyfriend,<br>  & you probably wont love him after dating for a monthhh.|`|kwgheTHEaa	I am sorry about your relationship. Although I think you should wait it out because if that guy you like more than your boyfriend doesn't like you, it's not worth it because you'll lose your boyfriend. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's smart to continue kissing him either.|`|qLeskIKJaa	number one it takes a really long time to learn to love someone not a month. it could even take up to a year ! but i think you should stay with your boyfriend. the other guy seems really flaky but stay with ur man and give him a chance.

Think, is your friend worth taking the chance and breaking up with your current boyfriend?|`|cxPQzqqqaa	threesome. do it.
AA11612508	my husband always wants better. he likes to live out of budgets. i hate that completely!! we just were talking about newer vehicals and our budgets of 8-10k apeice. then he drops a bomb saying i am getting a 40k car, i dont care what you say. ERRRRRR<br>  <br>  whoever pushes for nicer or more frugal, it starts lots of fights!|`|8PDzaAJcaa	Neither one of us HAS to have the biggest, newest, coolest whatever but, there have been a few times when I have pushed for nicer things. My husband is the cheapest man in America and sometimes looks at the cost rather than the functionality of things, but don't get me wrong I am glad that he is this way, it's why we have no bills other than our mortgage.|`|AA11538662	Neither. We both are happy with what we have and when we do want something newer, nicer and/or more expensive, we seem to always agree. I tell him that he is the male version of me all the time. But sometimes I wonder if he just goes with the flow to keep me happy.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|S9bEtVCSaa	We weren't married - but when I was in a relationship I was the one to push for the nicer everything. He always wanted to just make do with what we had. I tend to be a bit extravagant in my tastes though. But it's ok we're not together now, my place is nicer than his and so is my car. Hah. (cheeky grin)|`|AA11596133	I am not pushy and do not deal with people who are.  In ANY GOOD relationship. you put your wants needs and desires out on the table and NEGOTIATE, using reason and logic. <br>  <br>  Pushy people are SELFISH people - no thanks!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	We aren't like that, we're actually very simple in our needs.<br>  We're not out to impress anyone, just to be happy.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	My husband does. I just want peace in my life..he wants the richies!!<br>  <br>  Drives me nuts!|`|dprURFLxaa	He does...and yet I work...go figure.|`|8OREBeRdaa	When I was married, my wife would always want the nice stuff. I was just happy with "functon over form". If it worked - Great! People are coming to the house to see us, not our stuff.<br>  <br>  She cajoled, nagged, and complained for me to sell a bunch of my stuff before we got married (all that money went to the wedding and honeymoon). <br>  Now that we're seperated, she got the lion's share of everything and I've almost had to start from scratch.|`|ZsgCxVo5aa	Um.... WOW! Well, according to him I deserve the crappy car, cause he works full time, and all I do is raise the kids, take care of the house and the 9 hunting dogs we have, as well as run the errands, do the shopping, march to the beat of HIS drum..... and when I ask "Can we get rid of that Brady bunch yellow bathroom tile, I found enough tile at Home Depot for $120 take care of it, and know how to do it myself" I'm told that HE has no money, and then buys ANOTHER ******* dog we don't need! Or another outdoor toy, FOR HIMSELF! He'll tease me with "I'm looking at an ATV for you" and then BUYS HIMSELF A NEW ONE, AND PASSES THE NEARLY NEW, BUT USED ONE THAT WAS FOR ME.....AT 1/3 OF THE PRICE.|`|chENztVEaa	This is kind of a tough question for me because we are both pretty equal but I would say him.  I am more apt to shop around for a bargain and while he is a little less apt to want to spend, he is more apt to go for the more expensive.|`|opSJsUTZaa	In my marriage we both push for what its best for our family and for what we can afford. what's the use of having a nicer house or car if you can bearly make the payments.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	That would be me...if I didn't push - I would still be without a bathroom.  My husband is the fix it man - and you know what they say about that - yes, my house is the last one to get fixed...|`|5gWDZVp6aa	My husband!! i think thatz most men. want the bigger everything!! lol|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Neither one of us, really, but my husband is more comfortable making decisions about large purchases than I am. I usually defer to his judgment.|`|RwYIhCg8aa	Um.... WOW!  Well, according to him I deserve the crappy car, cause he works full time, and all I do is raise the kids, take care of the house and the 9 hunting dogs we have, as well as run the errands, do the shopping, march to the beat of HIS drum..... and when I ask "Can we get rid of that Brady bunch yellow bathroom tile, I found enough tile at Home Depot for $120 take care of it, and know how to do it myself" I'm told that HE has no money, and then buys ANOTHER ******* dog we don't need!

We both like our cars just fine, but we are house hunting now, so we have mutually done a lot of conversing about what our dream home looks like-things we'd like to upgrade many, many years from now. I guess, to answer your question, we are fairly content with things and so it's not so much pushing as audibly daydreaming.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I would have to say my husband. He's very good with money and paying bills, and saving for things. I'm not your typical woman. I'm not materialistic. While I do enjoy nice things, I can do with out them. As long as things are clean and work properly, I'm fine.<br>  <br>  But my husband had provided me with a very nice glamorous life style.<br>  He's a blessing and I'am proud of him!|`|zL1sggpCaa	That would be my husband.... I want a nice house and all, but he wants all the nice things in the house and the nice new cars. I want a home, he wants stuff. LOL|`|slHUNl58aa	My husband is the gadget guy. He wants to get me all kinds of things, he is so sweet.<br>  I like keeping things simple, and I hate to shop, so I humor him sometimes because it makes him so happy.
cxPQzqqqaa	all the time. I'm amazed at how wound up people get sometimes. I'm just one of those people that really doesn't care about anything that happens. Someone could accidentally shoot me or something and I would be like "Dude it's ok." People around me though threaten to kick each others asses over the stupidest things like someone thinking their fat or something.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Clearly you said something to deserve it.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	no. but, i do think it's funny.

Well, EF probably doesn't have a lot upstairs to offer but that doesn't matter with the DD and the tight end.<br>  <br>  What I learned from my EF (several years ago before hubby now) is what counts is SOUL. He was so right............|`|NSKimt1Qaa	Yes, you'd win her over with your sweet charm, caring nature, and heroic attitude.  Of course, that brilliant mind and those hardened muscles from those years of chasing, pummeling and beating up criminals and dead-beats don't hurt.

If you see yourself as old and broken down so will others. Would you be attracted to someone with that attitude? Get back in shape, put a bounce in your step and a smile on your face and maybe she'll be attracted. If not, someone else will. Don't fall for this I'm old BS.

It ain't over till it's over and if you can type it ain't over.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I know many women out there that have been treated poorly... and in my opinion, some of us aren't looking for the hot buff guy who is also an arrogant PRICK.... sometimes we just want a man to treat us right, no matter what he looks like.<br>  <br>  Or, at least... that is how I feel.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I don't know 'who she' is... But some people are shallow and only go for looks alone. Others go for love, and personality. It just depends on the person. I think looks are what typically attract people to each other, but I feel it's more important to have a good personality because we all age and our looks fade, so in the end if our personality sucks, then no one will want us. <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Looks arent everything but at least you should have stable life and can support yourself.|`|slHUNl58aa	Of course you can Eddie, just wear the the outfit.. you know.. lol|`|xGofrX5Iaa	If that ugly dude Seal can land Heidi Klum and Ron Jeremy can sleep with thousands of women then you have a chance.

If he doesnt, then its fine because you can always just say you meant it as friends.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	just act normal. let him bring it up first that way, you know if it is just you or both of you. i hope i hellped and if i didnt then i hope someone else does! bye :)|`|jvvDbAl5aa	um... i would just see what hes doing this weekend and go from there!<br>  :))))<br>  <br>  or you can just talk and if it goes anywhere, it was meant to be.|`|LxUJ1LTVaa	txting your feelings is not the answer to your problems. you both need to sit down and chat  have some time together .

yVmcIAEdaa	For some (and this is the exception) it is because they are waiting to meet the right woman.  Generally, (at least the guys I know in their 30's) it's because they simply do not want to get married.  They may care for or love the woman they are with but they just don't want to get married.  For some other guys I know they are not scared of commitment to a woman, but they do not want children (and understandably that is a deal breaker for some women).  For others they enjoy keeping their options open even if they are with someone they care about.  For other guys that have been divorced...they may care about the woman, but don't believe marriage is for them (e.g. if they never marry again, they will never have to go through a divorce again).|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I have way too many male friends in their mid 30's that have never been married and don't plan to. Most have had serious relationships in the past and they just don't see marriage as  being right for them. Not everyone is cut out for it and they love their bachelor lifestyle. I know they are not "afraid" of commitment (at least not all of them) but marriage just doesn't intrigue them.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Maybe he hasn't met the "right" person yet, or at least he's not convinced that he has.|`|AA11328507	Marriage isn't for everyone nor is it all that its cracked up to be.  He needs to marry WHEN he is ready and he feels he is ready.  Its his life and to make a life decision like that without proper feelings and thoughts is irresponsible.
kHLwlNA5aa	I'm the husband. My wife had two girls who I couldn't love more. It doesn't matter to me that I have no sons.|`|fSO7kfdGaa	My husband really didn't care either way what the sex of our unborn was going to be and I knew he meant it. My husband was really happy to hear we were going to have a girl my whole family said it would be a boy ( in my family every generation is a solid sex. One generation will be all boys then the next will be girls,  so far their have been 5 boys between my sister and 4 girl cousins) so I think it made him feel good, but I could be wrong. What I do know for sure is that she is a daddy's girl.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	We have no kids yet but I'd love a baby girl to spoil (I have 5 brothers and a whole bunch of nephews lol).<br>  <br>  Although everyone should just be happy with what they get. Don't pander to him if he's ungrateful for a girl, that's not acceptable. Every child is a blessing.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	mine loved it. i wanted a boy girls are to hard to maintain, he wanted a girl he comes from a family of 9 boys. To be honest I really didn't care what I had just has long as it had 10 fingers 10toes and so on. You know a healthy baby!|`|Z2xETWhbaa	My husband was happy.  As long as our baby was healthy it didn't matter to him.  Of course one of these days I would like to give him a boy but that is all up to his spearmies.|`|bO2rzfISaa	We have three girls. My husband is a wonderful dad. He's the one who made them girls anyway.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Shocked but in a happy good kind of way.  Girls are rare in his family.  So he was thrilled.  Our daughter is his mom's only biological granddaughter.
Ev3fFui4aa	The first year of marriage is the hardest - you have to adjust to thinking about the other person on an equal footing to yourself, which comes a lot more naturally to some than others.<br>  <br>  To cut a long story short, I walked out overnight, we had a SERIOUS and frankly very honest discussion, and that was enough to make us both realise what we were fighting for.  We are so happy now - particularly because we were so open about what was making us miserable.  What we said hurt the other, but you must remember your husband cannot read your mind.  You need to 'teach' him how to be a husband to you, in the same way as you learn to be the wife he needs.<br>  <br>  It's a lifelong process - stick at it, it will be worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  PS. If you tell him the I/me thing hurts your feelings, and he doesn't understand, or mocks it, try and find another way of explaining the same thing - or an example he might be able to empathise with.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|88a2e933993f652ca67674dcbd1fceacaa	What do you mean by going into hiding? This could be a bad plan - he could even take i to mean that your marriage is over.<br>  However, it might not be a bad idea to discuss some time apart, maybe you could go on holiday with friends?<br>  Also, if he is depressed, it might be an idea to see if he will talk to someone about it - if he's happier within himself, he'll be happier within the marriage.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	My husband and I are going through similar issues (not on the same page about some things) and we are in the midst of figuring things out.  But I would NEVER, ever want to be apart from him.  It will only bring other feelings into play such as independence and false feelings of security...  <br>  <br>  Your problem will still be there when he comes back, if he even does.  I don't know the full nature of what you are referring to, but running away from the problem/separating has never seemed to be a good idea in my mind.  You are partners for life, and you need to resolve the issues together, no matter how different your personalities are.|`|9qf2HSGYaa	This is not really something you can put a timeframe on, especially if you two are newlyweds’. It will take some time for him to get to the "us" part of marriage. It’s much easier for us ladies to adjust to "us" because that’s what we have wanted for so long. Guys just speak, and don’t realize or think to recognize the” us” part. If he didn’t care about that aspect of it, he wouldn’t have asked for your hand in marriage. You mentioned his depression, this is an even greater reason to give this more than 3 weeks, you should really be focusing you him along with him to strengthen himself. This will help him be a better husband and show him what kind of wife you really are.  Although he probably does or says things to make you have combating remarks, be careful how you talk to him, you don’t want to tear down the relationship with your words. Your right, divorce is never an option; your guys made a commitment for better or worse, wish you the best.
mtmBpFLZaa	HAHA the fart joke is so funny!.<br>  thats just like me, he sounds like a laid back person that likes to joke around. he likes to have fun. just tell him to not joke around too much when you ask him questions, he will understand and realize he does it too much.|`|VMY7No0eaa	He's a kid... he doesn't think in serious terms...<br>  You are going to have to be the one who either confronts him or ignores him.<br>  he probably won't take you serious until you are OUT the door!<br>  good luck<br>  sorry didn't give you examples .. hard one.|`|yj7Nndilaa	OMG! well usually joksters are insecure uneasy people who cover it all up with the way they act. He is trying to protect himself by being this way.|`|TCVKpfeJaa	Some people shake off their insecurities with humor.  Others incessantly request serious conversations.  If you don't feel like you are getting REAL answers from him tell him EXACTLY how you feel.  Don't beat around the bush.  Be to the point.  "It makes me feel like you don't take our relationship seriously when you don't answer my questions in a solemn manner."  Or "Please answer this question seriously, because when you don't it makes me feel like you don't care."  Communication is the key.  If you tell him and he continues to act the way he does, he's probably just a little slow.  With patience and understanding he might come around.  But if not there are plenty of serious-minded fish in the sea.|`|XtWSiFPsaa	try talking to him about his "seriousness" and if he gives you a sarcastic remark back then you pretty much know your answer<br>  <br>  and if he can never be serious then you can probably find someone more mature|`|8P3dYiOtaa	To be honest, I don't think somebody who wants to share his fart with you instead of his emotions and seriousness in relationship is not worth spending time with...|`|ufTuK9nBaa	well.. just confront him and tell him how you feel and  if he jokes about it then tell him i cant be like this in a relationship if your not going to be mature about it and see what he tells you and then if he really likes you or loves you then he'll change hopefully and if he doesnt then he's not worth it... <br>  :]|`|RKlGdphdaa	okay well to me i am a girl but my bf is the same thing.. i get really anppyed to but i dont tthikn he is always jooking around i put question marks at the end of the message if i wonder y they asked so if u said y do u fart only aroung me i would also say blah blah lah???
ZkeoRyy3aa	you need to call child protective services.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	911<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its sounds simple but i no its hard. you need to take a deep breath and pick up the phone. i promise it will be better once you do it. don't hang up, have your siblings there for reference. your sisters and brother could make all the difference. if the cops dont believe them, or you, then you have a lousy police station. go in and tell them wut happened. i promise that they will believe you though. good luck. :). im here for you.|`|GIlTkQu6aa	omg wtf is the matter with your dad. you poor thing. i would call child services|`|G0SvGeOWaa	Yeah the only thing to do is child services but i seriously doubt you want it to get to that point cause.....<br>  <br>  One, you don't want your dad to hate you<br>  and<br>  Two, you don't want your 15 year old sister to hate you (i understand im 15 you think you can take care of a lot more)<br>  <br>  but all i can say is talk to your dad....he is obviously not a trustworthy father.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Yes she is too young to have to take on that responsibility. Why didn't he take them with him to Colorado?  Do you live with your mom?  Your sister is bound to crack from the stress of having to take on so much responsibility so young she's just a kid herself.  I would try and talk to relatives or your mom if she is still in the picture and see what can be done that is definitely not a good thing for any of the kids involved.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Tell their mom, or call Child Services. You're right, that's not right at all.|`|vOODVZbNaa	If it's to hard to talk to child services or your dad you should tell a friend or a family member. Your sister shouldn't have to put up with that. I have a big family & having to do your school work is hard & stressful enough without having to look after your brothers & sisters. Even if your sister or dad or someone is angry with you afterwards you have to do it..they'll thank you later on when they see how much you've helped.
sLLgERQWaa	It was presumptuous and quite frankly, cheap & out of line to ask a bride for her wedding dress on LOAN  a month  after her wedding....and not even for a family member.<br>  On top of that the gal is 4 sizes larger, it means the dress will be altered, and do you really want some one else messing with your wedding dress? I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  And I guarantee you'll never get it back, either.<br>  <br>  If the subject comes up again merely say the dress is sacred to you & you are having it preserved to pass down to your daughter/grand-daughter one day,as is YOUR family custom, as a precious keepsake. (clue yer Ma in on that little white lie) Then smile & refuse to discuss it anymore.....good luck, the aunt & her DIL sound like  moochers.|`|q8eue7CRaa	You're not crazy. They have a lot of gall to just ask you that and expect you to say yes. I'm sorry your have crazy in-laws. :(|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	I don't think you're crazy. I would have told her the same thing. And according to the old wives tale it's bad luck to let someone borrow your wedding dress (good luck tot he borrower though).|`|2113a1c5edce39f4ccc550d347674ac1aa	I don't think you're crazy....and it looks unfair for your husband's relatives to think of you rude because you won't lend you wedding dress. Tell them that your dress have a sentimental value to you (for very obvious reasons). I personally will lend my wedding dress only to my younger sister or my daughter...but that's it.<br>  I wouldn't care what they think of me, but I can't imagine lending me dress to someone I don't even like.<br>  Just explain to them what you feel, if they still don't understand that, its their problem, at least they won't bother you anymore after this.|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	I don't think your crazy I think there LOCO !!! NUT's and their the RUDE ones for getting mad at you. It's your wedding dress , your money spend, you don't even know her like that. You spend your wedding Night  in it HELLO some people just don't think anymore.|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i'm sorry..i didn't read the whole thing.  BUT i don't think i would want anyone to borrow my dress even 10 years after my wedding!  it's MINE.  she may have to alter it and that will suck...and if you dont' particularly care for her, that is another reason to say no.  if anyone gets peeved at you for this, they will get over it.  seriously, that request is unreasonable.  say no and then say you aren't discussing it anymore.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I can understand her wanting to try and save money, but to ask a near stranger who probably paid a good chunk of money for YOUR dream dress so soon after your wedding, that is pretty crazy. I wouldn't want anyone to alter my dream dress. Enjoy it for the time, I wouldn't let her borrow it either.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	It sounds like you were more shocked than rude.  Obviously, it is best to help people out when you can, but you stated the dress would not fit the requester.  Perhaps had you not been shocked by the oddness question, you may have been able to respond with a better answer.<br>  <br>  Ignore the heat.  They will move along to another plan soon enough.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	Just move on. You said no and you should feel flattered. Obviously these people do not have manners and they all sound white trash to me.|`|68MkdEgiaa	I would not let her borrow it. Honestly if she needs a dress she has time to go and find one and if not too bad. You paid for that dress and it's yours therefore if you wanted to offer it to someone you would. Besides she didn't even ask you herself which seems even more odd to top off the whole situation.|`|9Fm8j2NUaa	You are not crazy at all! What an uncouth woman!! that is so unbelievably rude to ask to "borrow" a dress so you can completely alter it! Does she expect you to unalter it?? That is absolutely ridiculous.  Besides, she will probably ruin it trying to alter it that large. Dresses aren't made to be altered more than a size larger. I feel for you. I know what it is like trying to reason with an idiot! I would just say that you are not comfortable with her altering the dress. You plan on preserving it the way it is! Good Luck!|`|IUYpGvCXaa	Wow!  That is totally RUDE of someone to ask to where YOUR dress!  I would perhaps give them the name of the dress & where I bought it at the very most.  And to be honest...I don't even think you can alter 4 sizes up!  I would not loan out my dress to anyone...even a close friend.  I would only keep it for one of my daughters to use, if that was what they wanted.  Your in-laws are definitely in the wrong on this one!  I'm sorry you have to be put through this.|`|R8VhFeEVaa	Is it okay for me to laugh now?<br>  <br>  You are not the crazy one in this story.<br>  <br>  Wedding dresses are expensive. If she wants yours, and wants to alter it that much she should just buy it from you. And honestly, I don't think, (as an amateur seamstress), it is always possible to add that much fabric, i.e. take a dress up that many sizes! One or two sizes is hard enough!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Hmm...thats a little odd. I am thinking this girl just doesn't have the money for her own dress. PLUS...do you want to see pic of her in YOUR wedding dress? That would be weird. I think it is your dress, do what you want with it. I would just tell them that you have already arranged for your dress to get cleaned and then are planning on preserving it for you and putting it in a box to keep.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah I mean that person is pretty far removed from you, if it was your best friend or close relation I can see them asking you but not if they have to have it altered so much!  I would only think to borrow someone's gown if I didn't have to have it altered at ALL.  I mean that's yours for posterity, you want to remember what size you were on your wedding day when you try it on for fun down the road.  and that's the thing, it's your dress to have fun with, or put in your closet, or fly as a flag for all you care but no one else can tell you what to do with it.  you're not being rude, your husband's family is.|`|4POGapREaa	I'm putting myself in your situation and . . . HELL NO!!  I wouldn't let some funky chick that was dating one of my husband's friends wear my wedding dress.  How . . . just . . . eww.  No.  My husband's friend's girlfriend (who I can't stand) just asked me the other day if she could have my jeans that I don't fit into anymore.  I wanted to slap her.  And that was just a pair of jeans LOL!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes that is weird. Every bride should have her own dress. If she can't afford one or doesn't want to keep it, she could look into renting one. But borrowing someone else's is just odd. Especially since the other woman won't likely be the same measurements so she will have to have it altered to fit her, in which case it will no longer fit you.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	Above all the other considerations, the altering of the dress most dismays me.<br>  You would then have to go through having it put back to your specs (chances are at your own expense, as well as risking loss or damage to the dress).<br>  I see no moral obligation this person is owed by you nor any way that your refusal to "loan" something of such great importance to you can be considered "rude."<br>  Moreover, I find it rude that they should even ask with such high expectations of you obliging them!|`|R7b150Iyaa	You're not crazy, your husband's aunt and the "bride" are crazy!  I agree that it is disgustingly rude to ask you to borrow the dress AND have the nerve to get offended when you say no!  Screw them, keep the dress and ignore their stupidity.  How often do you have to see your husband's aunt or this woman anyway?  <br>  Congratulations on your recent wedding! =)<br>  <br>  PS If she's FOUR sizes bigger than you, they won't be able to take it out that much anyway and she'll blow more on alterations than she would on a brand new dress.  Tell her fat *** to get a new dress!!! Lol.|`|zSABr7praa	I don't think you're crazy.  The only people i'd feel comfortable loaning my wedding dress to are my best friends, or my sisters in law.. that's it. I don't care if i'll never wear it again, i'm attached to it.  If she loves it so much... let her know where you got it ;)
OC6ffEW3aa	Cheer up! First of all being single does not mean your not good enough it means that no guy has been good enough to be mr right. and being single is not a bad thing, it gives you time to become the person you wanna become, chill with friends and family, act yourself, dont change who you are just because your looking for a guy, be yourself and a guy will come along. i was single for 3 years straight and i just acted like myself and i met a guy we dated for a year, it was one of the best relationships i was in, but thats because i didnt rush into trying to find just a random guy.|`|JCdBSULraa	I usually feel the same way, email me, let's talk.<br>  My email address is in my profile.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this is wrong of me, but I find myself attracted to people who have the same attitude as you, it's like I can relate to them and help them feel better about themselves.|`|2vgbJhlRaa	how old are you btw? if guys dont like you for who you are then forget them...dont change who you are, cuz no ones worth you changing yourself for. dont worry theres probably someone falling in love with your smile right now you just dont know. keep smiling because someday someone will love you for who you are. Dont feel alone btw if you ever read any of the other questions on here alot of them feel the same way you do. best of luck :)|`|z3QsWmzpaa	just be confident and be yourself the right guy will come along you just gotta be patient i used to be very lonely when i didnt have a bf but i loved being single at the same time and i love him so much x <br>  <br>  hope i helped and if i didnt, sorry x|`|CR8RVs4Kaa	Love yourself, do not look for the right guys, and when you least expect it you'll run into the man you've been hoping and wishing for.

Wait, and someone good will come your way.|`|mpFuO5Ilaa	dont worry i felt the same way for years and then out of the blue like 3 guys like me. ur time will come, just be patient.|`|ar7ynJB8aa	Embrace being single. You're worrying too much about being single and changing yourself to fit in and to be with someone. You want to be yourself and have someone that finds you absolutely attractive in every single way. You don't want to meet the wrong guy and for him to like you for all the wrong reasons. That is what I think is worst than being single. <br>  <br>  If you're pretty/gorgeous then you have nothing to worry about time will come don't rush it. Some guys are just shy or intimidated by beautiful girls.<br>  <br>  Put yourself out there more. Stop worrying about outer appearances. Talk to more guys and pick which one you like and work on that.|`|F1hmgwcpaa	With my experience, I feel that being completely confident with yourself is the key.  I used to second guess myself like you, and then I just stopped caring about what other people wanted and I focused on myself.  If you just have fun with the dating process you're more likely to find satisfaction.  And don't be afraid to give those nice guys a try, you might be surprised.|`|31e5a99426b4d3dca4e3d800c081a1fbaa	Be more confident about who you are. Don't try to change yourself or guys don't like you for who you really are. Give it some time and eventually you will find the right guy. Don't think too much about whether people complimenting you is actually true or not. Chances are they are probably not lying about you being pretty or stuff like that.|`|0d5f73aab03f2fae4fe5060db324a6f7aa	first of all be urself, if ur relationship dont work, try asking the guy or girl what went wrong n u will learn from ur mistakes. it mite not be becoz of u so stop changing things about urself to get noticed, be who you wanna be n go chill wit ur friends, thats y they u have them, u mite find a nice guy on ur way to or from ur friend's house hu will lyk u for hu u r|`|j1Bgzxcgaa	go lesbian XD ha<br>  <br>  Not everyone meets the right one in highschool..sometimes not even in college-could be at work or something.

You need to work on your self esteem before anything else. Just being happy and confident in yourself will attract guys, promise!|`|f0YzgIoQaa	Relax and stop beating your self up. Your fine the way you are, and like everyone says, patience only thing. Always happens when your not expecting it. Even if it does suck waiting..<br>  <br>  "The waiting game sucks... lets play hungry hungry hippos"|`|11828c71068f8d346742bd68e2456376aa	Here is the thing stop changing who you are for other prople and be yourself.. In time that guy will come to you..|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	First you need to learn how to enjoy your own company and be happy on your own, and accept yourself as you are.  How can you expect someone to love you if you don't love yourself?  Being desperate and needy is not an attractive trait for anyone.  It's ok to be pro-active (put out personal ads, that sort of thing) but the right person will come when you're not frantically looking for them...and turning your life into a manhunt.<br>  <br>  Don't define your happiness by being in a romantic relationship. The heady passion of romance can be fleeting.  Also, having someone is no guarantee you'll always be happy all the time.  Lots of lonely married people out there, too.  Don't believe me?  Try visiting a nursing home and see how many of those people living there who are married and had children, but who NEVER get visits!|`|VMY7No0eaa	GO TO COLLEGE... and learn something new... that is a great place to meet people.|`|W28ALDEmaa	Oh. Poor You.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously. THe right guy will come along some day. <br>  You probably have friends.<br>  So you shouldnt feel alone, just because theres no guy in your life. <br>  Just Live it Up, and wait for the right guy to come along.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Just be confident and comfortable with yourself.

a898q23kaa	Some military men want baby after baby to "leave something behind" in case the worst happens. Others avoid the issue and heartbreak completely (at least they feel that way) by not having children at all. Looks like you married the latter. Respect his wishes for now and try to talk to him about it later, since right now both of you are so sore about it.|`|PxdRxDoeaa	My guess is you already know why he doesnt want more kids. Your may allay his fears if you know how. This maternal instinct comes and goes. You don't have to try not to have these needs. It'll go away on its own in time. But then, you may remain unhappy for a while and thats not good for the relationship. Go see a marriage counselor or talk to his closest realtive - perhaps his mom (whichever you find comfortable).|`|0zhSMDfxaa	I don't understand you. .You want kids and he doesn't why do you need to change. Why can't you both compromise. Talk about it. But I don't think you should give up the thought of having kids because he doesn't want anymore. Maybe you should give him up...|`|kALxfgT1aa	You don't just get rid of the feeling of wanting another.  It is in your very DNA.  You either accept it or you don't, smae goes for the hubby.|`|e32AantFaa	It sounds like he may have commitment issues. Both of you should go see a counselor.|`|BoMN9kDwaa	thats what you get for be with a jar head!|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	You recognize that you have a wonderful son right now and realize that having additional babies or not, will not make the world go around. <br>  <br>  Having another baby isn't as pressing on raising the one you have. Focus on and put all of your mothering energy into raising him. You may always feel as if you want a baby but realizing that it may not be best for the ENTIRE family, may ease that feeling a bit.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	You may never be able to get rid of the idea that you want another child and your husband does not but the least he and you can do is sit down and talk about why he does not want a child and why you do.  You need to communicate with him and he needs to communicate with you so that you both understand the other person.  You may not be able to convince him to change his mind and he may not be able to convince you to change your mind but at least you talked about it and see the point from the other persons view.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	It's obvious that he doesn't feel the need to have anymore children. You said the first wasn't planned. Did you discuss kids before you were married? Did the two of you decide on how many kids you wanted? Or did you agree to wait for awhile? It seems to me that you might have changed the agreement a bit.<br>  <br>  If you didn't discuss kids before you were married, then that's your bad.|`|AA11328507	Have a final talk with him regarding why he doesn't want another child.  Its not fair for him to say no more kids and thats it.  You deserve to at least have a conversation and to decide together what is right for the both of you.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	I guess you enjoy what you have. You have a son, you have a demanding, peevish husband. You have the American dream.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	express how you feel about the sistuation and ask for more indepth feedback|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	You need to tell him how you feel. If you try to repress these feelings you will end up resenting your husband and your marriage will suffer. Three years is a ways off maybe by then he will have changed his mind, but don't bottle your feelings in. Wanting to have more children with your husband is a perfectly normal thing and if it is what you want and need then it is worth his time to at least have a discussion about it. Good luck.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	There is a woman in Romania who had a kid at an age of over 60. I do not recommend this but I cannot help but ask, "what is your hurry?" Maybe your husband wants to wait until he is discharged before considering having another child. Why don't you wait until he comes back from his overseas assignment? Check out my source for more info on marriages.|`|ESj0Ch56aa	you cant just stop wanting to have a baby, you should talk to him and tell him that you should have a say in it too, and there has to be some compromise he cant just say no, and why would he not if your happy and you have one together i cant see why he wouldnt want to have more kids.|`|9pyDheAyaa	well, i would wonder if i would really want to have a kid with a man who doesnt care to. that means he probably wont be so involved nor much of a help. you guys need to sit down and talk about it more seriously. make sure he realizes how serious you are so that maybe he'll start to think a little more on it.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Start by recognising it as a WANT, not a NEED.

Find another man.|`|0ad0e076bc7090a52b21c57c55f2a226aa	Throw yourself body and soul into raising the one you have. Take him to museums, the library, plays, outdoor concerts. Volunteer at his school, with his playgroup, and be the house all the kids want to come over to and play. Spend all your free time making crafts, playing, teaching, and just having fun with him. Do your housework after he goes to bed, and have no free time for yourself ever. You will raise a brilliant, kind, wonderful son, and be too exhausted to even think about having another one. (If your child has any physical, behavioral or learning issues, make sure those are resolved before you consider another as well.)|`|Va8SHVdJaa	Well, understand that you cannot simply "get rid of wanting another".<br>  That should not be your goal. That is like trying to take away God given desires.<br>  <br>  The main focus and concern, however, needs to be your husband, marraige and your one child. That alone should keep your attention to the max. If you're wanting another child when your marriage is becoming shaky, and your relationship needs work, then your desires needs a self-examination as to your motives, desires and what's going on in your heart.<br>  <br>  Most mothers (some fathers) desire more and more children when their own marriage continues to go downhill. They feel somehow that children will make up the lack of needs being met. This is a FATAL mistake for a marriage.<br>  <br>  If you can put your energy and focus on what it needs to be, your marriage, then your "desire" for another child will automatically go down. If you continue to allow that untamed desire for another child to fester and grow, you will continue to sabatoge your marriage and you current child. Don't allow immature, unbalanced emotions to rule you.<br>  <br>  Take your marriage under control, and get back to being close and loving with your husband. When you fix your relationship with your husband, it's almost a guarantee that he will want to be more involved with children in general. <br>  <br>  Make it work. <br>  more in our book:<br>  <a href="http://www.marriagefortoday.com/book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marriagefortoday.com/book.htm...</a>

At the shower, ask the bride the same questions. After she gives her answers, reveal his. For any that she misses, she draws a guest's name out of a hat and they win a prize (box of chocolates, lotions from Bath and Body Works, whatever you think the ladies in attendance would like to receive).|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	the only cute game I've ever seen at a shower was they gave a quiz about the bride to the groom in advance.  like who is her favorite band, what's her favorite food, etc.  then you ask the same questions of the bride at the shower and see if her answers match up with what the groom said.  for every wrong answer, give her a piece of gum to chew and at the end she should have a great big wad in her mouth, it's funny as hell.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	ugh, I hate bridal shower games with a passion.

Families can be very important to some people when they are thinking about moving forward in the relationship. He has to be one one to face his family and their religious values. I would let him know how important he is to you and if there is something you could do to make this easier for him.But he is the one who has to decide what is best, because its his family that will have the problem.    You need to ask yourself if this is something you would want to deal with the rest of your life.

Well, if you really cares about you, he will get over the fact that his family may not approve of his relationship with you. I would just give it time, not everything is resolved overnight. You guys are 28 years old, he doesnt need his family to approve of his relationship. Over time, they will get over it, ya know? I know its a situation that sucks, but he shouldnt let his family get the best of him. There must be something else bothering him? Sit down and talk with him. Ask him what hes going to do if his family doesnt approve, if he isnt going to stick around, then find somebody who will. <br>  Best of luck.

tvyuWhd9aa	well, it's not rocket science sweety..you shouldn't stay with anyone who abuses you, no matter what! Yes you might be scared of being financially unstable, but these things work themselves out. Life is too short to let another human abuse you.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Sweetie, I didn't read all this, I got to the part where he punched you in the face and that's all i needed to hear.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you this. They NEVER change, they NEVER stop! I was married once before, and he was abusive as well. I stayed with him for 4 years, hoping and praying that he would stop and change. He didn't, it only continued to get worse. Thing about your issue is, there is a child involved. If you stay with this man, your child will grow up thinking it's ok to beat the one you "love" or allow the one you love to beat you. Trust me, I know because my ex-husband's father beat his mother all the time, that's what made him the way he was. <br>  <br>  I finally got out of it. I had a reality check one night. We were driving over a bridge, and I was the one driving. Out of no where he freaks out on me and punched my right in my face, it made my eyes and nose burn and hurt so bad, my eyes were watering really bad, and I couldn't see the road. I was all over that bridge, going into the on coming traffic. It scared the hell out of me. I didn't know what to do, cause I couldn't see for anything. So I did the only thing I could think of , and that was to slam on the breaks. Luckily I didn't hit any of the other people on the bridge, my car was a little messed up from ramming into the side of the bridge railing. <br>  <br>  I played it cool. I drove back home, and told him that he needed to go out with his friends and relax a bit. Then I took my car and the clothes on my back and walked out, I never looked back. So please, get out of this. It will never get better no matter how much you want it to. ANd I know you don't want your child to end up being like that when he's married. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|X7rPWJU8aa	i have to ask why would you even care how your husband feels? he accuses you of cheating. ( something  that the one who is actually cheating does to deflect any suspicion from them self.) 2nd he hit you. not during a heated argument but flat out walked up and hit you. that tells me that if it would have been a heated argument you may have taken one hell of a beating. once a guy hits he will usually do it again. <br>      as far as child care if your mother will watch your child while you are out dating why wouldn't you and her want to make a change for the both of you and allow you to find better employment? instead of going out every night and having her watch your son that time could be used to better your financial situation.<br>    go to the police or county courthouse and file for an order of protection. and have supervised pick up with the child. ie a police officer or the police department for a pick up and drop off point so the father can still be apart of the child's life. you haven't said whether or not he has been abusive to the child so I assume he hasn't. <br>  after all this then work on your new relationship. this isn't what you want to hear but its sound advice. safe guard yourself and your child first then worry about your relationships.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	"He walked over and punched me in the face" followed by "But I don't want to hurt my husband."<br>  <br>  Are you nuts?<br>  <br>  Get out while you can and stop all contact with him. You don't want your son growing up to be an abuser too, do you?|`|bQpIctgPaa	File for divorce, get out, and make it work.  You can't live your life as a prisoner because of your husband's temper and unpredictibility.  Just separate and split ties with him.|`|9gxzPlZZaa	Leaving any relationship is hard, no matter if its violent or not but you have to do what best for you and your son. If this man is going to adore you and your son then I would not care how my husband ex husband feels. Nobody deserves to be abused and everyone deserves happiness. I think what you should do is get a restraining order and move with this other guy and let your ex know that you are happy and have moved on. Don't let him intimidate you, just know you are free from the abuse and have found happiness. Life is to short not to enjoy it and especially with someone who adores you. I wish you the best.|`|naequcqlaa	You are being physically abused!  This is a total domestic violence issue if I've ever heard of one.  I too well know about domestic violence as I was involved in it.  This abuse is NOT going to get any better!  You have EVERY rite in this world to fear getting hit OR WORSE in the future.  This I can in all honesty tell you & I for one would be very concerned about it.  I don't understand why you do not want to "hurt" your husband?!  This makes no sense whatsoever.  Here he is abusing you, beating you, hurting you, & you're afraid of hurting him?  I'm sorry, BUT you are doing nothing but setteling for less.  You are accepting the unacceptable!  The next time he lays a hand on you, call 911, get a restraining order against him, & he will NOT touch you again.  He w/NOT be allowed anywhere near you.  This is exactly what I did.  You've got to do something about this.  There IS help out there for single women w/children & dependants!  You deserve it, find out about it.  If you'd contact Family Court in the county you live in, you could find out ALL the rites you DO in fact have.  This is just what I did.  Believe me, judges do NOT look favorably on domestic violence, not one single bit.  And, especially w/a child involved.  PLEASE do go, you don't even need an apt., but go to Family Court & see what they can set up for you.  They are a super bunch of people who w/go out of their way to help you.  You do badly need help, & need it NOW.  You've got to do something, this is what I fully highly suggest you do.  Just go on Monday & get it taken care of ASAP.  I know you can, DO IT.  They WILL take care of you Trust them & stop accepting the unacceptable.  I'm a firm believer in that things do happen for reasons.  We may not know at the time, but they indeed do.  Do please go get the help you so badly need, it will NOT cost you a cent, but at least you'll have peace of mind.  And please above all else, be very careful of this abuser.  He is NOT going to get any better w/o a LOT of professional help.  There is a reason he is so filled w/anger like he is, but it's NOT your fault, not your problem, it's his.  He can deal w/that IF he wants to. But you've got to distance yourself from this man, & NOW.  I DO wish you all the best, you  CAN DO IT...:)|`|5b2d156b924538e090ecddccd4f39d54aa	GET OUT # 1.  no man should ever hit a woman no matter what she did or did not do.  get subsidized childcare get friends to watch your son there are many options out there.  if you are still living with him and he did that to you while you weren't cheating on him imagine what he is going to do when he finds this out...GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT

I felt so bad that she felt she couldn't talk to me about it and I feel really bad that we missed so much.  Talk to her for both your sakes.|`|gPeEdjmuaa	You have to talk to your mom and tell her how you feel. It will only get worse if you put this off. Your mom most likely isn't expecting you to be your sister exactly, but to try to excel and follow your sisters example - it seems like she only wants you to do your best and most likely she thinks you are capable of exceeding maximum potential. Talk to your mom separately about this situation and explain to her how it's affecting you. I don't think she realizes she is comparing you with your sister. I doubt she likes your sister more, I think she just expects more out of you, all mothers want the best for their children.|`|edIUAbCxaa	look bro, just be yourself. you dont need to pretend to be like someone else. everyone wasnt born the same way that's why you're different from your sister. if your mom isnt happy with the way you are, just deal with it. if you cant change, then dont. as for me, i wont change for anyone.|`|JHUT3Sqtaa	The same thing happens to me except my brother is a little kid so he always gets attention so if I act like I don't want attention from my parents I usually get it! haha reverse pshyology.|`|PpYBnxgpaa	i don't think its that hard to be a good person . all it takes is a little effort|`|hqfH47tHaa	Just be yourself and TRY your BEST not to mess up...btw you can't say your'e happy for her yet you hate that she never "messes up"...not everyone is the same just be the best you can be and don't settle for mediocrity you'll be alright..your mother doesn't like your sister more than you hun just relax,do you and STOP being envious of your sister cause that will get you know where..don't be a brat you are the older one so act as such!|`|VygBNA0Waa	its hard being a parent the first one always feels worse off because you have to break through the protection line your the first one to ride your bike go to friends place hang out at the mall sleep over friends places it hard as a mother to let go so you give the child a really hard time about trust and letting go for your sister it is easier for her because your mum has already gone through it with you so there is less fights she has seen by letting you go she done the right thing and you are ok and you handled it fine so its not that she hates you and likes her more its just hard because you are the eldest|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Wow, thats exactly how me and my brother used to be!<br>  <br>  Im sure she doesnt like your sister more, she just knows that you have so much potential!

I have a boy and a girl as well and I can tell you that the girl gets a bit more attention simply because she is a girl, traditionally girls need more attention than boys, its not fair but parents are fallible, keep in mind that parents want their children to do well in life and sometimes you have to ride a kid hard to get them to excell. You don't have to be like your sister to get A's. Talk to her about it, if she understands what you are saying she will tell you what she is trying to do, but I expect that you won't understand fully what she wants from you until you are much older. Best thing is to grit your teeth and bear it, you have a looong time ahead of you to understand it but a short time to deal with it.|`|NjGFiwahaa	Sounds like your mom is just blinded by how perfect your sister is.<br>  HOwever, this doesn't mean your mom likes your sister more than she likes you.<br>  It just means she wants what's best for you(which is making straight A's and whatnot)<br>  But again this doesn't mean she doesn't love you. It's impossible for a parent to love one child more than another, despite what anyone may say. She may love you for different reasons and not like your certain flaws but she definitely loves you the same. Just talk to your mom about how her acting makes you feel.|`|QtoElnKeaa	I don't mean to upset up but are you really trying ? what do you mean your messing up is it your school work? your concentration ?. <br>  Your mum loves you two the same amount maybe shes more proud of your sister because your sister does better at school but she loves you. Ask yourself does your mum really love your sister more because shes smater?. Or is she more proud of your sister because she trys harder?. It sounds to that you can't become your sister but you can improve.  maybe not your sister is perfect but with effort you can become a different perfect not her perfect but yours kind of perfect with effort it can happen. <br>  <br>  Ask your mother how she feels i'm she loves you two the same.|`|KPtSq0Uyaa	to be honest with you<br>  im like your little sister<br>  and my older brother is like you<br>  i as a little sister would never want my older brother to change<br>  because i love and except him for who he is.<br>  its okay that they want you to change though.<br>  but they final choice is completely up to you :)<br>  so don't worry about it.|`|EXeS92peaa	You mom your feels she should give you some motivation.

0wdEcNk1aa	Unemployment (especially right now) is not a criteria for losing custody. A guardian ad litem is really an attorney for the children. His/her only concern is for them, their safety, and their overall wellbeing. If she is neglecting them, the guardian ad litem will note it. If the unemployment is causing a lot of caretaking issues (which I doubt) that too will be noted. So if you are being good parents (which I am sure you are) then you have nothing to worry about. So relax and just be honest and straight forward.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Custody arrangements usually have very little to do with income.  They are usually more concerned with the living environment and support system of the children.  The guardian will work in the children's best interest, not the mother's, not yours.|`|4HoVVCenaa	No, guardian ship is based on what is best for the child, not on income. .|`|q411DXsFaa	Nope, Because you work.

7gH7sgi6aa	If your Mother convinces the police that you are a threat to yourself or others they will place you in the hospital in the Psychiatric Ward under a 72 hold under court supervision. You will be evaluated at that time and it will be determined if you truly are a threat to yourself or anyone else.  It may be that they recommend further treatment, but I know that you Father is going to have to be involved in this process also.<br>  It is not bad.  It is like a regular hospital, but you just cannot leave.  Try to behave yourself so your Mother will not have a reason to call the police until your Father returns.

mqMhrmloaa	if he's significantly bigger than you, don't do it. <br>  <br>  telling on him will only further the problem. <br>  <br>  you could always get a friend of yours to beat the sh!t out of him for you!<br>  <br>  but if you're close to the same size, then don't do it during school - you'll get suspended. don't do it after school, you'll get suspended and the cops will get called on you. stalk the guy for a couple days to make sure he doesn't do anything out of the ordinary and you know where he goes after school. then when you know he's the most vulnerable, go at him. hard. with no remorse. beat him senseless. if you wanna talk first, thats fine, but i wouldn't do that if i were you. aim for the side of the jaw first, then hit the temple. no body shots unless you have to. and do not kick him in the nuts unless you're getting your *** kicked. another alternative to getting your *** kicked is to pick up a brick or something. all is fair in love and war. and this sounds like a war to me, kid. <br>  <br>  i wanted to kick quite a few asses in high school. i didnt because it didnt mean much to me and they didnt do much to deserve it. but this sh!thead has it coming to him. remember, ALL is fair. aim precisely. dont let up. once he's down and OUT, get outta there as quickly as you can. i really hope this is good advice for you man. be safe. dont get caught by the cops.|`|usj1lyfFaa	Sounds like you're about ready to get your *** kicked.

IcH5gMICaa	I think you need to decide what YOU want first.  Hey, either you want the guy or you don't.  But don't decide to just pop in his life every few months and "be friends".  It doesn't work like that, and it only makes things a lot worse.  No wonder he acts so weird.  He probably does have a lot of feelings for you, but has to suppress them because he never can read your actions or thoughts and as a male, he's not going to know how either.  Really, you need to make up your mind that you want to be with him and be his girlfriend, OR you need to leave him alone and stay out of his business...including when he does things like pick up your friends sister.  That's between him and that family and not you.  You are not his keeper or his savior and although people suggest you talk to him, you can't go on believing that just because you suggest things to him that he is automatically going to do what is right because of you...that's a really narcisitic thing to do.  <br>  <br>  Once you make up your mind, your actions need to read that decision.  Either you confess your love for him so he KNOWS that you are there for him, or you don't make any more effort to be his "friend".  That includes when his friends look you up on MySpace, or he calls you, or someone tells you he is passing on personal information about you.  you have to ignore all of it in order for HIM to go on to lead a normal life.  If you are going to call or text or anything as soon as a "problem" arises, then that opens the door for MORE "problems".  But if you just ignore it for the time being, eventually it will stop and he will have the chance to finally move on with his life.<br>  <br>  You have involved a lot of other people in this and pushed them all to be against him.  His reactions are either going to be fight or flight, so you can't really blame him for shutting off.  You've embarrassed the crap out of him more than once and it's surprising to me that he'd still even let you come over or call him.  Most guys would have been done with you the minute that fight happened.  I know he wasn't going around and saying he was going to fight every single male friend you had bc he was so in love with you...so I think you started that in a way.  But part of me believes you did that because you still wanted him as well.  But you have to let your heart talk for you and not your head in order for you to be happy...and for him to be happy.  Continuing on like THIS is going to make you both miserable.  So YOU decide either you want to be with him and start over OR that you are no longer opening the door for anything else involving him.|`|etQvVNaaaa	O-M-G i cant believe you wrote so much!<br>  <br>  But i am going through the same thing too gurl, if you feel it was meant to be & you see yourself not happy with anybody than him then I would try it again. But like ppl always tell me you should follow your heart but sometimes your mind make the best decisions for you!<br>  <br>  Just take some time to think about it and try to see your future with him....if it seems good then go for it....bad then leave him alone<br>  <br>  You only live one life so take risks and live your life to the fullest and never say " o i shouldve did this and that", no regrets<br>  <br>  && good luck to me && you!<br>  <br>  =] KS3

Rrsp3fWIaa	Same as when your carpet matches the drapes.<br>  (Hair color downtown is the same as on your head).|`|jqD3OBVuaa	There are many things that could be meant by that.<br>  <br>  1. Matching Luggage, a multiple set of luggage that all matches in pattern and fabric for the sake of travelling.<br>  <br>  2. Your luggage matches someone elses luggage, meaning your baggage/issues are the same as someone elses.<br>  <br>  3. The answer you are probably waiting for, does your head hair match the same colour as your bush hair. For instance, if you are a blonde on your head, do you have blonde pubic hair. That would be matching luggage.|`|m8IeEvNpaa	matching luggage is matching luggage...

hkwBR1moaa	So you decided on the ivory... good choice.  I think no necklace with chandelier earrings.  As for shoes, if it's outside in a garden, I wouldn't go with really big heels.  You might want to take the dress to some bridal stores and try it on with shoes to get a feel of what looks good and what doesn't.  Congrats|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	eh, it's not my style but go for it.  you know what you could do is pick a color and do your necklace and earrings in that color instead of going with silver or gold jewelry.  like angelina at the oscars with her big green ring, you know?  maybe some different color gemstones or costume jewelry would look nice with that dress.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!<br>  <br>  Ohh...that is pretty.  I love vintage myself.  <br>  <br>  I agree with the first poster.  I would do shoes that match the color of the dress.  Vintage?  Quite possibly you can find some vintage shoes that would look great.<br>  <br>  I would NOT do a necklace.  I would only do earrings.  As the first poster said, I would opt for pearls.|`|23qMl5LXaa	Wow! Thats lovely! I personally have always been a big fan of the full skirted wedding dresses, but this probably hits my 2nd favorite wedding dress I've ever seen! I think that a pair of georgeous silver sandal heels or maybe if you can find them, clear. I would say, a really georgeous silken stole/sash that you around your body and just on your arms, if you know what I mean?|`|7CKipTZOaa	Gorgeous I love vintage dresses and lace. I would go with a gold pointed flat or strappy sandals that are dressy and keep jewellery simple, maybe pearl earings, simple solitaire studs but nothing overwhelming so that the focus is on you and your amazing dress|`|s9Uufsr0aa	silver strappy sandals|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Definitely go with classic, vintage pearls for the dress.  That would be gorgeous and will keep in line with the "vintage" style.<br>  <br>  Have your hair in a half-up/half down style with loose curls cascading.  <br>  <br>  Shoes?  You can go with a pale gold or ivory shoes.  Even silver.  But I think i would do pale gold (I had an ivory vintage style gown for my dress as well and paired it with pale gold shoes and it was gorgeous.)  <br>  <br>  Keep the veil/headpiece simple.  A simple pearl studded veil.  Maybe a bobbypin with pearls on them throughout the hair do.  <br>  <br>  With this type of dress, simple is the way to go.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	This is perfect for a garden wedding! Gorgeous. <br>  <br>  I would go with very simple accessories because the dress speaks on its own, you don't want to overdo it. I personally, would not wear any jewelry with it, maybe a lily in my hair or pearl bobby pins.<br>  <br>   I would wear espadrilles with it - maybe like these:<br>  <a href="http://www.espadrillesetc.com/view.php?id_generico=00269&search=&secorder=false" rel="nofollow">http://www.espadrillesetc.com/view.php?i...</a>|`|4dXcZhuTaa	beautiful.<br>  i'd wear pearls, like pearl earing's just simple, just barely dangling.<br>  very simple, because you dress has a lot going on ( in a good way).<br>  <br>  and shoes... white or cream, i assume your dress is one of those two colors, aaand they should be simple, possibly closed toed, or even just YES a peep toe for sure =)|`|2kl0vQjVaa	YAY!  You got the Ivory one!  It is so pretty although I voted for the others, lol!  See if they have ivory shoes on the same website (which is awesome btw) and I would wear pearls and rhinestones for jewelry.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	It's a beautiful dress! I would go with a vintage shoe, something strappy, ivory and maybe with a kitten heel. I agree pearls would be awesome!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Gorgeous! What a great dress! I love the vintage look and the lace detail is beautiful. I would buy some great vintage heels in ivory and wear a teardrop shaped necklace.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	I would do a heal that matches. No necklace cause you already have a busy gown. Just some dangling earrings should do. Very pretty gown!!|`|j1k8qGd6aa	It looks perfect for a Garden wedding. Not too much material to have to deal with.|`|9Fm8j2NUaa	That dress is Gorgeous!!!<br>  Here are some shoes-<br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49997459&currentIdx=3&subCategory=-49998498%7c-49997996%7c-49997459&catentryId=6087357" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49997459&currentIdx=36&subCategory=-49998498%7c-49997996%7c-49997459&catentryId=6087399" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some earings-<br>  <a href="http://www.overstockjeweler.com/designer-inspired-classic-crystal-mother-child-chandelier-earrings-p-1346.html?osCsid=cob5lrk3ggig4n451o622atnb5" rel="nofollow">http://www.overstockjeweler.com/designer...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.overstockjeweler.com/designer-inspired-classic-vintage-love-drop-chandelier-earrings-p-423.html?osCsid=cob5lrk3ggig4n451o622atnb5" rel="nofollow">http://www.overstockjeweler.com/designer...</a><br>  <br>  I think that a vintage or antique inspired chandelier earing would be gourgeous!

KWeU8LJtaa	I think that would fun, I mean I wouldn't have karaoke all night or anything lol but maybe a half hour of karaoke or something.<br>  <br>  It would be really entertaining to see some of my relatives trying to sing lol<br>  <br>  So, 1, assuming its controlled|`|JbRTKDFmaa	It depends upon what kind of wedding it is. If it's a big formal fancy wedding, it might be a little odd. However, if it's more casual type of wedding, I think it would be just fine.|`|7CKipTZOaa	1 if the couple loves karaoke, otherwise around 5 it can go either way depending on the guests vocals :)|`|Tc23KWgzaa	An absolute 10.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I don't think it's tacky at all.  I have a friend who had it at her reception.  It was awesome.... It was a nice venue and everyone was dressed formally- and people were doing karaoke!  It was really fun and entertaining.  I also have a friend who is a wedding DJ and has done it at lots of weddings.  If you are a wedding DJ and don't already, I think that you should definitely offer it as an option.  Some people really love it. You're surrounded by family and friends so you know you won't be booed off the stage!|`|28aa15ff815174fd0da9e6d6dd19aeedaa	Not tacky at all.  We went to one wedding where they had it for part of the reception and it was the BEST time.  It brought a lot of energy to the reception and kept people who may have left early at the party.  It was a hoot!|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	I think it's tacky (a 10!) unless you were having a REALLY laid back wedding.  Funny thing is this month's issue of either Modern Bride or Brides (I forget which one) was saying how it is one of the hottest trends right now.|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	9,10 almost 11.<br>  <br>  My personal views, but you do as you please it's your wedding. <br>  <br>  Have fun !|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I'd give it a 1. I'm planning on having a backyard reception - very cookout like. Karaoke would be fun.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	As long as there is a DJ too, and the karaoke is only for a short period oft time, I think it would be fine: a 6!!!|`|2kl0vQjVaa	I agree with Kiwi.  I wouldn't make the whole thing centered around it but it might be fun to do for awhile.|`|LU7WB6Poaa	10|`|cFUVQSThaa	If it is a big part of the couples life, like they go out 2 nights a week to sing karaoke and many of their friends sing it as well it isn't a bad idea. But I wouldn't have it at my wedding because I don't think anyone would sing, or not at least until the 4th hour or so and after all of those drinks it wouldn't be too pretty.|`|NwdBaVonaa	10.999<br>  <br>  wouldnt suggest it. not very classy. but it depends on what kind of wedding you want to have.|`|bfd831fc22129c8c522639f390e60fc3aa	If the year was 1990- 5.97<br>  2009-9.34|`|q3ulEHYAaa	Not for me. I'd have to say 10.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It all depends on the crowd. It's tacky in some situations, and totally fitting in others. If the majority of guests are not the types who like karaoke, then it would be tacky. This is just something that the couple needs to judge for themselves.|`|F4k68ilkaa	12
gEkLQWF4aa	I know EXACTLY what you're going through. I was also at odds considering if my dad was going to walk me down the aisle or not. He is also an alcoholic, and abused my stepmother, who is more like a mother to me than my birth mother, and she's also my best friend. She will be my MOH, and I was worried that there would be some sort of drama with my dad walking me down the aisle, or that he would show up drunk or something. But, he is my dad, and there were great times spent with him when I was younger, and because he is an alcoholic it changed him into someone he is not. I asked peoples opinion, and they said I would probably regret for the rest of my life not having him walk me down the aisle. He loves me so very much, and it would hurt me a great deal if he was hurt, regardless of the things he's done. He has tried on so many different occasions to be a better person, but the alcohol keeps taking a hold of him. I went to lunch with my dad a few times, and talked about the wedding and how important it is and when I told him he would walk me down the aisle, he got all teary eyed and was soooo happy that I wanted him to do it. He knew the mistakes he'd made, and he was scared to death I wouldn't include him. He even asked if he was even invited at first. It made me sad to see him hurt over the things he's done. If your dad knows you want him to walk you down the aisle, I think it would make him so happy that he would be on his best behavior at the wedding. Talk to your mom about it and ask her if she would be upset that your father would walk you down the aisle and give you away. It is supposed to be your day, and it shouldn't just be about them and their past battles. My dad was never mean to me, but it did hurt me to hear about the things he did to my stepmom and brothers, but I know deep down he's a good guy, but alcohol can do some bad things to people. My stepmom is the one who told me that if I don't have him walk me down the aisle I may regret it for the rest of my life, and I just don't want to do that. I don't see the harm in having him give me away. I am his only daughter, after all. And I love him very much, even if he wasn't there for me for a long time. I say talk to your mom and see what she says about it. He is your only father, and I think it would just make things more awkward and uncomfortable if he WASNT walking you down the aisle.<br>  <br>  EDIT: aww..that's sad. I think you should let him at least walk one daughter down the aisle. I know he's screwed up a lot, but poor guy. I bet it really hurt him bad when she didn't let him walk her down the aisle. Probably a slap in the face. How has he been lately? Is he mean to anyone? Is he mean to you? If not, I say he should be allowed to walk one daughter down the aisle. I don't see the harm in it. What did you sister have to say about it? Does she have any regrets? I really think you should be the bigger person and forgive. Being able to forgive and not hold grudges is a great quality that not a lot of people possess. You'll feel better for it if you forgive him.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	well you can walk yourself down and then when they ask - who gives this woman away -- your dad can say - her mother and i do....  you could have your mom walk you down and again your dad asnwer but.... if you're looking to keep the peace I would walk down yourself & have him answer. this way you woudl be holding up what you told him - he IS giving you away  :)<br>  <br>  good luck - just enjoy the day!!!|`|qVL5R8nuaa	As bad as things are he is the only father you have. Instead of walking down the aisle alone why not have him accompany you? It may mean a lot to him and it would cost you nothing.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	That's always a difficult situation. This really comes down on your shoulders and if you really feel honestly comfortable with it. I think you said yes because you were nervous that he would get mad for not including you. Do you have someone else to walk you? Is your mother coming? Do you think they will fight? <br>  <br>  If you think there will be drama, I wouldn't do it. This is your day and you want to-and everyone-to feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  Be honest with yourself-truly figure out if you want him to walk you down. It might make him so happy and proud and if you don't, it might strain your relationship further and hurt it even more.<br>  <br>  Do what is best. Good luck.|`|KOzKxIP3aa	First you have to decide if you want him to give you away.  Remember this is your day.  It not about what he wants, or what anyone else wants.  Will it ruin the day for you if he walks you?  Later on would you regret it if he didn't?  If you decide that you do not want him to...just tell him.  Tell him ASAP do not wait till the day of the wedding.  Don't let him assume that he is doing it if that is not what you want.  Do what will make you happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  ;-)|`|iKD1JUg1aa	i think you should tel him now...you dont want all that drama on your wedding day...tell him why you dont want him to walk to or if you dont want to tell him the truth then make something up if you dont want to hurt his feelings...but be sure to tell him before your big day...good luck!|`|8g51eBf1aa	Tell him the truth, that you don't want him to give you away. And don't wait until the wedding day either. He'll get his hopes up otherwise. Tell him that he's invited but that's it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	No, don't just leave it - talk to him and explain that you are walking down the aisle alone! You should have told him no right away. Definitely bring it up and have a talk about it.|`|zSABr7praa	I think it would be very uncomfortable if your father was invited, but did not give you away.. but that's just my opinion.  I was maid of honor at my best friend's wedding, and she chose to have her step father give her away, and from being at the altar, I could see ALL eyes go from the bride, to the father of the bride.  Everyone was waiting on a reaction, and you could read the judgement on their faces.  It's my opinion, that if your father is there, he should walk you down.
vOODVZbNaa	Ya its definitely possibe to like someone like that..but that person has probably gotten bored of talking or something..it sounds like a crush but you should really let it go..if their not willing to talk then maybe you should find someone else to talk to & avoid crushes on people you really don't know, it should save you the pain of it all.<br>  Good Luck:)|`|X9cGsOq8aa	It may be a crush or you may have fallen in love. when you see him in person try talking to him and make convo with him..well i hope this helps GOOD LUCK
tlxG2q04aa	You could go round to their offices and speak to them in person if you want.  <br>  <br>  Why can't you just phone them?

I finally gained the courage to talk to him but practicing. I went home almost every day and talked to my teddy bears as if they were him. When I did talk to him I just pictured my teddys and I was so comfortable around him. Just try it, even though you may think it sounds silly! Good Luck|`|FXD0rHyzaa	nawehh i was like that with this boy =]<br>  im with him now XD<br>  but i was really nervous and it went well <br>  just talk to her as if you were mates you dont know it could<br>  lead to some thing good ^ ^|`|sro58m5zaa	u are probably in love with her !<br>  <br>  cheers !|`|WeSdUJy9aa	You like her!  <br>  Ha ha....this happens to me with guys when I really like them.

5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	We were friends for a while before we started dating, and in our friendship we told one another we loved each other, so when we fell in love, it wasn't a Big Moment when we started saying it to each other...because we had loved each other a long time before it became a romantic love.|`|woOeYFrEaa	Hmmmm.  I don't think either of us started really saying it until after we were engaged.  Long story short, we were engaged after 6 months of dating, 5 years of "just friends" and then 2 more years of dating.<br>  <br>  I think we both felt to say it was a commitment and not something you say easily.  I dated other people, but my husband is the only man I ever told him that I loved him.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	He said it first.  It took him about a year to say it.  But then again, we were in no rush as we're not in our 20's anymore.  So I think when people are a little bit older and more mature, they tend to wait a bit long because they want it to actually mean something.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Oh gosh, he's always said it a hundred times a day. We probably weren't even married 2 minutes when he said it!|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	He said it first... after a few months.<br>  <br>  I was like WTF?  and said it a few months later.<br>  <br>  He claims to have loved me since the moment he met me... it took me a little longer to get there?|`|5FlfBmZ9aa	Well I am still dating, but I typically wait for the guy to say "I Love You" first, and then if I love him back then I will say it back. I usually fall really fast so I try not to set myself up by saying those 3 words too fast and I just wait for him to say it and truly mean it. <br>  I have also, heard of other girls that just say it whenever they feel it so, I guess its all depends on how you feel.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	we were a little weird on this subject. <br>  <br>  He officially said "I love you" about 8 months in I believe.  <br>  <br>  But he started with "I wub you"...first time he said that I just looked at him and was like "Is that the 'discount special'/walmart special version of Love?"  He laughed and then I said "I wub you back".  That happened about four or five months in.  And until he said "I love you" at about 8 months, we said "I wub you" or "I discount special you" instead.  <br>  <br>  We were living together by four months though.  We both knew we did love each other, but we really wanted to make sure it had feeling behind it and we were completely 100% sure.  I think that was one of the only things we didn't rush in our relationship.  (took a vacation at 2 months, Moved in together after four months, married a year later...)|`|AA11776857	Hey! well, my husband is in the Army and before he shipped out, he said it to me every chance he got! I was the one to say it first though because with us, it was love at first sight. We say it to each other like 30 times on the phone and in letters we send back and forth! We'd say "i love you" to each other like every 10 seconds if we had to!|`|CF1R0TPvaa	After about two months my wife sent me an email that said "did I tell you that I think i'm falling in love with you?"  <br>  <br>  This is the same woman who, 14 years later, will not initiate sex or touch me.  You think she was lying when she emailed me?<br>  <br>  "... is there a line that I could write<br>  sad enough to make you cry<br>  all the lines you wrote to me were lies"<br>   --- Gin Blossoms, from Found Out About You|`|20NGQtCbaa	A few months. I said it first. We were watching a Back To The Future marathon and I was so emotional when the Delorean got struck by lightning that I just blurted it out.|`|jtjISk6qaa	took him a month and a half. were not married yet though.|`|d8pt9KMyaa	had to be about 5 years.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I don't remember. We're not mushy types, we don't say it very much. Words are cheap.
KBKvUwAlaa	Yes I was spanked quite often.  And yes it made me part of who I am today.  I am curious Rachel, where did you get that number, because it looks like one you just made up off the top of your head.|`|Lq7T2Jk8aa	I been spanked by my parents quite often. And a few times by a teacher and principal. When I was growing up, short shorts were in for boys that I wore everyday during the summer so when my dad put me over his knee, a few hard slaps would hit my bare upper thighs---ouch.  This did make me listen and behave since I was a bully to some kids or try to scare shy kids by acting tough. I also liked to swear too and ride my bike over people's lawns. So yes-- I really needed to get spanked until high school and would probably continue juvenille behavior if I never gotten spanked. Other punishments dident seem to help as much.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Abuse such as spanking etc does not make you a better adult.  As a child it makes you fearful of the abuser.  I was not abused, I was treated fairly with time outs etc.  This is an appropriate punishment it teaches a child there is an undesirable consequence.  It does not make you fear it.  Or resent the person punishing you.  Also kids that get hit are 89% more likely to hit, other children, their children etc.  They can become violent adults.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Yes, I learned the idea of consequences at an early age. Boundaries of behavior and to respect authority. "Beatings" is an incendiary term. Today is what would have been called a real good asswhoppin' then.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	My dad spanked me with a belt once. And I sooo deserved it.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	I was spanked, and I do believe it made me a better person.<br>  <br>  There was no problem with repeating the mistakes I made<br>  after I was punished.<br>  <br>  I learned to respect adults, authority, and how to behave in<br>  an acceptable manner.<br>  <br>  I was not abused. There is a difference between being<br>  punished and abused.<br>  <br>  I do not hit my kids. I dont have to..they are great.<br>  Best wishes|`|vvQBkzCtaa	i was mentally and physically abused every day and yes i am a good person and treat my kids very well, but my kids are way better than i was and will be cuz they are treated with respect, love and tenderness ,and positive punishments that billedtheirr selfesteemm,and make them more responsible, and overall better kids i have 6 kids and they have never been spanked they are all on the oner roll,and very respectful andhelp-fulll and loving ,mi do have troubles out of them but not very often|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  When I was gr owning up my mother use to throw a shoe at both me and my sister.  My dad was a quiet person but usually took my mother's side or he would have gotten a ear full.<br>  I am glad that they were st rick in dating etc because they were only doing this for our sake not to get into any trouble at school and the law.<br>  Now reflecting back it made us what we are. If we were not afraid who knows what trouble we would have gotten into.  Today we are better because of strick parents.  Especially when you see what is going on out there in the real world.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	i never ever got spanked or punish. my parents didnt think it did anything except make the child mad and resent them and i have no problems today  lol like im not mentally unstable or physically lol and i wasnt a wild child or nything|`|AA12198711	No actually I don't think they helped at all. other than helping to form resentment toward it.|`|b43a33e2944997688273683dcaf355f2aa	I'm 46 years old and yes I was spanked by my parents, and even in school, do I think it helped Yes I do, It taught me that there was consequences to my actions.And there is punishment if you brake the rules of home and society. We were corrected but never abused. I had 2 brothers, and one sister, all four of us have grown up, work at public jobs, raised a family, didn't serve time in the prison system, don't do drugs, have not killed, raped, etc anyone, so it helped us.<br>  And I personally feel if more parents would spank/ correct there kids today we wouldn't have a need for children's services, juvenile detention centers,and all the other systems that is a waste of tax payers money|`|TDiRmT9daa	Yes my parents used physical punishment - sometimes crossing the line and being outright cruel. No it didn't make me a better person. How can you be a better person when the people you rely on to protect you and keep you safe are the very ones to turn on you and attack you when you are helpless and vulnerable?<br>  <br>  Their abuse created pain and resentment, damaged my self-esteem and gave me issues that took years and years of therapy to work through. I am 48 years old and I still struggle with the emotional baggage.<br>  <br>  My husband and I raised 4 kids and never hit them or verbally abused them. When I look at my kids compared to me there is a big difference: no scars. Just beautifully well-adjusted, self-secure, healthy people who never rebelled because they were loved, respected, heard, understood and nurtured. They are respectful, compassionate, kind and close to us and each other. They live with dignity and integrity because they don't know what it is like to live with shame and humiliation. They never will.<br>  <br>  I believe in discipline - holding children accountable and responsible for their actions and choices, and I believe in setting the best example possible. I did not pass on the hurtful legacy of my parents or their parents before them because I didn't want my kids to suffer as I did. Now I can see the beautiful future that will be the legacy for my children, my grandchildren, and for generations after I am gone.<br>  <br>  And it brings me peace and fulfillment.|`|rsZmpfMpaa	haaaaaaaaa im hispanic. we dont just get spanked; we get beat with the chancla {sandal}. LOL. but then when i got older i started to not get chancla, but punished like not being able to go out or use the phone.<br>  <br>  in my opinion i think that when i have a kid i wont beat them i think punishments are better. id take toys away or something like that.  i think this will help them realize that if they do something wrong they will get consequences just like when you are an adult, when you do something you shouldnt do you get consequences and its a good thing that they learn that at an early age. the hitting or spanking part is very stupid.<br>  <br>  i think the punishing that came from my parents did help make me a better adult. but the chancla did absolutely nothing.|`|4CDVFjPEaa	when I was 12 I got spanked with the belt for breaking my little brother's favorite.  After getting the spanking and the tears having reddened my eyes I had to apologize to my little brother.  After that though I took my allowance I had accumulated over the past few weeks and replaced the broken toy.  If it wasn't for the spanking I wouldn't have done that|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Yes my parents would slap me and my mom would pull my hair sometimes. One time she busted my lip open. This went on til I was about 18. No it didn't make me want to obey them or make me a better person. In fact it made me afraid of them and even more rebellious. Eventually I stopped being afraid because I knew what to expect and I knew I could get over being slapped and just keep doing whatever I wanted.|`|UiXJLrDWaa	yeah and  spanking does not make you better.|`|PN7XMglOaa	I only had to be spanked once . I got the message . Oh boy , did I get the message .|`|cOce5YbRaa	Yes, we was spanked and sometimes what you would call beaten with a belt when I was growing up. Yes, I think it did me some good mainly because it taught me respect and that I couldn't do whatever the heck I wanted to do and to me it showed me that my parents really loved me. My Dad would get too carried away at times with his belt spankings because my older sister was always in alot of trouble and they didn't want me to turn out like her. But they never tried to see that I was not like her and never wanted to be like her. When I got older, my parents apologized to me for the way they treated me because of my sister. I told them they never tried to accept me for me and that I never wanted to be like my sister whatsoever and never was like her and never would be like her. They agreed and we let it all go. Now, kids don't get spanked and they have no respect for anyone and sure don't have any morals either. But if you spank a kid now, they can call the police on you or Child Protective Services and I think that is total BS. These kids now are so out of control it is beyond ridiculous. My step-kids are spoiled beyond recognition and get what they want when they want it and go where they want when they want to no matter what. Their Dad has done this with them for years and they totally disrespect him and me. They cuss us and even get violent with us and he does nothing about it. I told him if he doesn't start doing something about it and put a stop to it, I am kicking them all out and will never get back with him. I can't take anymore. I didn't ask him to spank them though because he wouldn't no matter what. I told him to at least get onto them and ground them or something. When you show a kid they can't get by with everything like my parents did with me, it teaches you respect and morals. And yes, I am a better adult and am a counselor. I try to talk to these kids and I don't holler and scream at them ever like their Dad does and their Dad cusses at them when they make him so mad. I have never done that but they still show no respect. They learned from the best-their Dad. I firmly believe in spankings and if they was my kids, I would have spanked them many, many years ago. Now they are 16 and 13 and beyond help. But I still got spanked or whipped with the belt even in High School.
Id1ypViXaa	i wouldnt worry about it|`|AA12198711	First driving without shoes is against the law, period. <br>  <br>  What your nephew sees in you is harmless.|`|GYzw6BVeaa	I agree its a phase and most kids don't like shoes anyway.  If you remember back, its confining to have shoes on, or to wear socks in your shoes is also confining.|`|aR23OWgBaa	I have a similar experience with my own nephew who decided at 16, that he wanted to be "like Uncle Bob, and always walk Barefoot". <br>  He's 24 now and is a full time Barefooter as I am, and works at a place where he fixes Jet Skies in South Carolina, so that he can be in his Barefeet 24/7 like me. The shop's owner  is also a Barefooter, and thinks that my nephew is cool and setting the right tone by always being completely Barefoot.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Kids are so easy to influence.  So the general rule is to do as you want them to do.  If you like walking around with no shoes on, do it.  But when he is around put a flip flop on.  It was not be hard for you.  But if it will make it easier for him mom, then you should do it.  <br>  <br>  Not to mention that he could step on something... you are an adult.  If steping on a rusty nail and getting an infection is OK with you then that's fine.  Do not encourage him to do something that could cause him injury.<br>  <br>  Shoes are made to protect our feet.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	People do it all the time.  I think in their mind they're getting over someone, but the way it feels to be the one used is that the person is a sadist.  You can call her a "bar fly," but she is a human being and he is using her.  This would not give me warm fuzzies about my spouse to see him doing it and it sure isn't demonstrating he is trying to work out a marriage with you.  He's just trying to make you jealous.  jmo|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, it doesn't matter what HE does.  Right now you're obviously still too focused on him and what he's doing.  Worry about yourself.  Of course you can move on.  I was married for ten years and together with him for 15, we had a house, cars, money, jewelry and have a son together.  Getting thru my divorce was extremely difficult.  But I did it.  Because I needed to do it.  And now I'm with someone different and it's a better relationship.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Why are you worrying what he's out and about doing?? Men react and deal to things A LOT different than women.  Women tend to wallow and cry after a relationship ends.. men tend to jump into a new relationship.  It doesn't change the way he feels.. just the way he deals.  Instead of pondering if he still has feelings for you.. or be angry that he didn't grieve enough.. worry about yourself.  Make sure you are healing and moving on.. coz you deserve to be happy too!|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	I don't think so. They are there to fill the void. They make the pain bearable. It isn't as wonderful as he's making it sound, he just wants to give the impression that he's fine without you. Deep down I'm sure he misses you a lot.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	It's just a rebound for him.|`|fsHgUrcAaa	If you're absolutely certain he still loves and has feelings for you, then no.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Sure; moving on is a gradual process, and it can take place while you are dating someone. In some way, you might always have a "special spot" in your heart for a person who was once important to you, but it shouldn't stop you from seeking and building meaningful relationships. In the case of your ex, it sounds like classical example of a rebound relationship - and very often these relationships are an important part of the "moving-on" process.
AxCDyX2Caa	Without love, so depressed about that.  In almost the best shape of my life, so pretty happy about that.  I do live in the US, which has its pros and cons, so semi indifferent in that.  All in all by your measures, I'd be a nice "meh" indifferent right now.<br>  <br>  However, I'm actually pretty happy, and that's because along with love and health, one of the most important things in life for me is becoming more/better than I was the day before.  Growing and learning.  It can be something as tangible as going back to school, or something as intangible as figuring out what kind of man I am.  That actually has a big influence on my relationships as well.  When I'm with a girl, do I feel the drive to improve myself?<br>  <br>  All that being said, I'd really like to find love.|`|TyJuZnZhaa	I'm not happy at all. More or less, I'm just emotional besides the emotion "depression."|`|e8bRcVNAaa	NO. I am extremely sad and depressed. In fact, I'm gonna die when I'm 21, suicide! No reason to live anymore! Don't care about anything.|`|An2KCMnwaa	I should be, but look no money, no car, which leads to no woman.<br>  <br>  Hey, can I borrow your car? Yeah, the Jag|`|RLoilwCNaa	Yes.

LzJJn1m7aa	I AGREE WITH YOU A HUNDRED PERCENT~!!! That is what she is asking for and then they cry and wonder what went wrong-dress like a slut you get treated like a slut. Dont put out like a slut if you want a serious relationship. I never did and guess what IM MARRIED NOW! I treated myself and my body with self respect and didnt play games and goT a good guy not a player I didnt put out til we were engaged and almost married WOMEN learn from this!!! As a woman, i think women cry for no reason and they only get treated the way they ask to be treated!|`|OgnpYIBnaa	to be honest i dont know why the put out  within a week. but to show skin, they want to attract their date. they  want their date to think there "hot" i guess I dunno but what they dont relize that they can still look sexy and cover up too.|`|ZqK045Svaa	i think most girls do it because they think that men find "sexy" attractive which means more skin = the guy will like her <br>  they only do it to "hook" you|`|kO7xsy6xaa	They are looking for sex.|`|nAK82h6vaa	Wow.Don't judge all girls,Some of us are not that easy.|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	Git, my friend it is a two fold process in getting guys to respond.  We men are physical creatures and if the woman moves in that direction is not saying that she is easy.  She may just want to sure up her catch. Most of the time women are not going to show up wearing a long coat to where the guy can't see anything.  She wants to give her best chance of letting him see what he might get.  Also, she tells you what she wants and some of us just don't take the time to give it to her.|`|67989651fa22e1e5264bb57e77eb8e16aa	That goes both ways dear.  Just because it is there you don't have to accept the invitation if that isn't what you want.  If your looking for a relationship and find someone that is  advertising everything she has, tell her honestly, that you saw as much of  the outside that you want to right now. Tell her  you want to get to know the inside first. Remember,   You have just as much invested in the relationship as she does.  Tears are tears with or without mascara.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	i have c cups and love to show off cleave, I hooked up with this guy and wore reveling cloths but it was 2 months before we had sex, we have been together for three years, but we are older in mid twenties and I think he was more mature about the relationship and that it wasn't just a bunch of raging hormones in control. I don't think it's the way you dress I think it's your level of maturity|`|24NojJFqaa	Men are from Mars.  Women are from venus.  First and foremost, men and women don't think alike.  Second, all females are not the same.  But no one gives you a book on how to be.  A women may do certain things to get a guys approval or disapproval.  A women showing up completely covered may be a date to show you she is not interested.  While a guy sees this as a respectable woman.  Showing up uncovered can mean I like you and I want you to like me.   We all do what makes sense to us at the moment to get the result we want.  Unfortunately the other party doesn't always see it the same way..<br>  <br>  <br>  Women go through several stages in their lives as do men.  A women learns at some point that, that is not the message you want to send to a guy you want to stick around.  However, men also do learn that just because she shows skin doesn't mean she was waiting for you to lay her down.  It's all about maturity.  Both sexes reach a point where they are comfortable with their sexuality and themselves to have sex in a week's time and not put much into it.  I understand it from a guys (5 brothers) and girls perpective.  On the journey to discovery we all mature and this is apart of the process.   <br>  <br>  the best piece advice i got from someone i dated who broke my heart:  Honesty.  Since then my dating life changed dramatically.  I started being honest with myself and my date about exactly what i was thinking.  I didn't take advantage of their weaknesses, which for a girl is accepting gifts from a man you have no interest in, which is just like a guy laying with a women on dishonest terms knowing he doesn't want her in that way.  I also asked up front what his expectations were, and told him mine, this way everybody knows what they are in for.  No black mascara.....LOL....|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It's her right to dress however she wants. There's nothing bad about the human body. You think that if she dresses provocatively that gives you an EXCUSE to treat her like that's all she's good for? Your problem is you are too weak to put your hormones aside and get to know a person while you have some cleavage in front of you.  Grow up.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Open a magazine, go to a gossip website, turn on the TV, watch a movie. Now tell me how those women are all dressed. Has that answered your question?|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I agree, women who dress like that on the first few dates can indeed be sending the wrong message. And as for women who put out after only a couple of dates, well its a no brainer there not looking for anything long term.|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Some girls like to dress a certain way, though fashion is not the issue I hope. <br>  This reminds me of the argument for the hijab that claims it's worn to hide certain features because they drive men wild with lust...surely you're not that weak that a little ankle jumps your engine?<br>  Not all guys are like you, but to face facts, quite a few of them do jump to images of prostitutes if a girl dresses like she's advertising herself. That's okay, a little offensive but okay enough to think. The problem lies in the fact that people are more than what they wear and what they look like so if you're holding it down as a fact that a girl who wants sex and dresses provocatively on a first date only wants to be a "playground", that's as fiercely incorrect as your number of question marks. Obviously it can be true, but that bit of doubt must be worth something, especially when it comes to social situations. If you yourself  are looking for a relationship, then it would be up to you to determine how much the doubt is worth.<br>  Secondly, as far as looks go, the first impression is in all actuality pretty dicey. People also change, and 6 months is plenty of time for one to happen. First impressions are lasting impressions in a photograph but with real living people, it's not so stapled.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|bVROvLNSaa	WOW!!<br>  <br>  You hit the nail on the head, brother!!<br>  <br>  I believe that the problem is absent fathers.  There are far too many girls growing up in single parent homes, where the mom has to be dad and mom.  That is not possible, a girl needs a dad to point out to her exactly what you so clearly expressed in your rant.  While I don't agree with everything you say, you do make a very valid point.<br>  <br>  Well done!!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	A woman has a right to dress however she pleases.  Your problem is with lack of communication.  You ASSUMED that because she dressed the way she did that she didn't want a relationship.  You were wrong.  Be a man and learn to communicate instead of holding women to ridiculous standards.

As far as the guys who are harassing you, just turn them in to the guidance counselor, the principle, even a teacher, schools are not supposed to have that behavior.

How do you know that he got a card? if you live with him -- don't get your hopes up, that it's an Engagement Right.. as he's already getting what he needs. Anyway, why would he need a new card, to get you The Ring? (He doesn't have any others?) Maybe this is some sort of friendship thing -- because he's guilty over getting you nothing much for Valentine's Day? who knows.. your birthday coming up? can you imagine, if he's bought something for his mother or sister, etc. and here you are, getting dramatic over nothing?<br>  <br>  From experience, I have to say that for The Ring -- I wouldn't go to Kay.  (That's like taking you to McDonald's on a 1st date.)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Wow! I think you already found out what he wants to buy you hahaha<br>  <br>  I never said you snopped, I said that you found out.<br>  <br>  Anyway well, maybe he intends on buying it but he didn't buy it yet. He just opened a credit card account with them!|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Don't spoil it. Try to forget you even saw it. If he did buy a ring he would be sad if you already knew.|`|JrKDKkR2aa	It could be if they offer a discount for opening an account with them at the time of purchase.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	If he has not given to you yet, chances are he got something for someone else.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Perhaps you should ask your boyfriend.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	It means he got a credit card.  Period.|`|nckz5ETbaa	Well it shows he is looking into some type of nice jewelry for you, so I would at least be excited about that.  Try not to get your hopes up too much because if its not a ring you still want to appreciate the gift he did get you or at least thought about getting you.|`|Lw4H1FCKaa	Do not assume anything. It could be a necklace, a bracelet or a ring. I would just not mind it and if he brings the surprise, then you know why the envelope was there for.|`|uplHIW2Baa	Probably.  You can usually open store credit and use it right away without having the card.|`|dUeDmb7raa	he might have gotten a card from them, or made a major purchase, who knows<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  regardless of what is in the letter he has stopped by kay jewelers<br>  <br>  <br>  congrats|`|uAhqtWuyaa	Yeah he probably is thinking about getting you the ring or like  somebody else said maybe he already got it .|`|71EwzPSlaa	he got approved and they sent the card....it doesnt mean he bought anything yet...but he could have just wait a few days and see what happens lol|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Every kiss begins with Kay.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	YES! So act surprised!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Probably! That's how I found out I was getting my ring too! The bill came. How romantic? <br>  <br>  Do not- I repeat- DO NOT mention this to him! EVER!|`|2inO6x5raa	maybe. or maybe he just got the card to give you a ring for no reason. theres no telling|`|8g51eBf1aa	He probably is in the process of buying a ring.   :)|`|vj93MNjBaa	I don't know the answer, but I bet your boyfriend would...|`|ECe1rgsdaa	It could be either one of those things. Or, he just bought you a nice gift that you haven't gotten yet!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Don't assume :) That always gets us girls in trouble... It can be for anything!!  Kays doesn't only sell engagement rings... :)<br>  <br>  No offense to your bf, but if this is a surprise for you, he should have mailed it somewhere else...  Ha ha.  My fiancee used his BFF's house..  And we're not even living together, he just didn't want me to "stumble" across it.  <br>  <br>  Relax and pretend you never saw it :)|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Could be a ring, could be another piece of jewelry. Don't jump to conclusions it is for you. How old is his mother? Is she having a big b-day coming up? Or maybe its a big wedding anniversary and his dad wanted him to get the account so it doesn't show up on his cards and she can see it.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	why dont you just be patient and see? <br>  <br>  because the more psyched up you get now, the more disapointed your going to be if it doesnt happen when you expect it too<br>  <br>  let it be a surprise|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	You couldn't tell from his credit card if he bought you a ring, but you could tell from his credit card statement. But then, that would spoil the surprise...and his trust.|`|AA10922449	Don't open your boyfriend's mail.
AA11309717	First you need to get better grades. This sounds to me like your mom is extremely stressed out about something other than your grades. Yes mothers will implore you to better maybe even threaten you with the loss of an x box or loss of driving privileges or something along those lines, but telling you she'll never talk to you again is a bit extreme. I need to ask you some questions, is your mom a single mom? Is it stressful where your mom works at? I'd go to the school counselor and ask him/her not only about what you can do to raise your grades but what is going on with mom.<br>  <br>  It could be that your mom had a bad day and over reacted or it could be that she's under a lot of stress at work. What does your dad think about all this? Do you have an aunt or an uncle you can talk to about it? Maybe they'd be willing to talk to your mom and tell her "never talking to you again" is more than a bit unreasonable.<br>  <br>  If these don't work for you then e mail me jon_john1958@yahoo.com an I'll be more than happy to talk to you about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ipiCyE3zaa	she will talk to you again obviously, but she is clearly upset about your grades. you could explain to her that although you have not been working as hard as you could, you will try really hard and apologise. meanwhile, at school, you could pick up your grades by talking to your teachers and paying attention in class.<br>  if you mum still doesn't talk to you, it'll be her loss when you get great grades next time round XD|`|d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	LIke mother like son, both are just miserable to see the other suffers or unhappy. Your mun wishes you well and same to you. Try your best and not just make empty promises, you must improve your grade to make every one happy. That what u can do and do it best.
vYeS5mYnaa	u owe your father no explanations. if u are able to leave, get out!!|`|1l04qpOKaa	Tell him the honest truth, he's a grown man and he can handle it. It may hurt him but how many times has he hurt you? Hopefully he will respect your decision to move out. If he was beating you, I'd just pack up and leave, there is no excuse for abuse. Good luck to you!|`|8aOh2Efraa	Well, first make sure you have a stable place and situation to move into. Then just say hey..it's time for me to move out. <br>  Thought about college or a tech school?|`|JrKDKkR2aa	tell him that you are tired of his crap and you want to go. Slam the door, and call the cops.  Go live with another family member.|`|t8swfyD4aa	say goodbye as your walking out the door.  then actually walk out the door|`|tGcNmDUZaa	Why don't you just say to him "dad, I love you lots, but you have treated me badly in the past, especially by hitting me last... (date). Now I'm almost 18 I've decided to move out and live ...(place). It's not something I'm doing out of spite or anything like that, and if you change your behaviour towards me you're welcome to visit me as often as you like."<br>  <br>  Please, don't do this if there is any chance of him hurting you. Rather move away quietly or talk to someone you trust so they can be there when you tell him so things don't get out of hand. Good luck, I wish you a world of well.|`|snqTm3gTaa	If your truly serious and determined on moving out...<br>  First, Get everything in order/ready to move out. <br>  Show him that you have prepared for moving out and he will be more accepting aftet he sees you are serious. Make sure you have every aspect covered... Living/Expenses/Transportation/etc. <br>  <br>  It will be hard, but dont just run out and try to make it, take some time to get this all prepared. And when the right time comes you will have shown him that you are mature and able to handle the new responsibility. It will bring you closer.|`|c49655b078fee5ada1988bd6c0f38631aa	Well if i am in your place i do not leave him alone you know Why? Well no body understand you very well but your family understand you very well. Know you 18 after few days you find a boy friend and then some party, sex, ect ect but when he leave you where you go Next new boy friend Just sit and talk to your  Dad and tell him the problem ok you go and move on but dont close the door like your mother.<br>  if i say some thing wrong i am sorry.<br>  tahirandtahir@yahoo.com<br>  i am passing throw same type of problem talk me on me e mail i will give you some more advise|`|O0D9GtElaa	All you have to say is dad i love you and you have taught me so much, so i think it is time for me to put that knowledge to good use and try out the real world on my own.  I think it would be a smart decision for me to learn how to take care of myself now, but i know that i will always have your support and you to help me in case i fall.  I love you so much, but i think it is my time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!! Good Luck:-)|`|UzlkwSC3aa	Go to a nice restaurant and tell him there. He may say no. Don't worry you have planted the first seed.<br>  <br>  Wait a little while then ask him again, don't worry if he says no again, by now he has time to give it some thought already.<br>  <br>  Wait a little while again and then ask him again, I think this time he will discuss it rationally. Eventually he may say yes, or make changes at home that will make you want to remain at home a little longer.|`|Ux8ei5i5aa	U dont really have to tell him anything! If you are going to be 18 and he is abusive just tell him... "Its time for me to be on my own" Make sure you dont ever have to go back! That will make it really bad! Good luck!|`|xHvnGjCKaa	If he's a person who could keep his feelings inside he wouldn't have yell or beat you up! He should just keep quiet.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	Just tell him and then tell him why you are moving out!<br>  you're be grown there's not much he can do, if he dont' want you to|`|SdDvbPf0aa	dad i want to move out''|`|7i0r7DZoaa	I think you should pick the right time to tell him, when he is relaxed or something. Then break it to him gently, and say something on the lines of, I am getting older now, and I would like some independence now, and I don't really want to stay here all of my life. I would like to experience living alone. *Hint* If he is afraid of you going, and doesn't want to live alone tell him that you love him, and will visit him as often as I can. (Maybe he is yelling at you because it is very stressful being a single parent. If you move out it might take a lot off his mind.)|`|4358e7a6acd949961830438fc1f7b201aa	Im so sorry for what happened.<br>  The best way to tell him is telling him how you feel, let him know you love him with all your heart & thank him for being there for you! I know my dad & mom use to beat me too lol, but they do it because you did something wrong, anyways hope everything goes ok with you and your dad GOOD LUCK!|`|E1dLCwk8aa	you dont you just move. Or you can always say you want to show him you are responsible and do it on your own.

2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	your best bet is to record how and what your step mom says to you so you have proof..Don't antagonize her so she mistreats you though..Ask a friend to borrow a cam corder or call someone on the phone and leave it off the hook so that person can hear what she says to you..Also tell your dad even if you cant record how she treats you..If he doesn't believe you then next time she hits you call 911 and tell the operator..|`|9fDkrrFyaa	write him a letter and threaten to tell the police|`|DNCpCjqjaa	Just sit down with him alone and tell him you need to talk to him about something really serious...and be honest and tell him what's really going on.

Then he will definitly believe u. Even if you dont have any proof dont worry he is your dad and will always put you 1st before your step mother, so he will believe you and will thank you for telling this to him. for him ur the most important thing in the world. good luck and dont wait much longer to tell your dad. tell him asap|`|HQfyPWXJaa	UMM..  I think you should find some kind of way of proving to him that she really hurts u.  Maybe try recording it or something.  Because your dad is probably in love with this girl and might find it hard to believe that she would really hurt u.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|FtTx6cLdaa	tell him, he is your father!! Or you should report it to the police!! Sorry, I know how you will feel about this but this is serious!!

You can do a DNA test, get child support, but nothing or nobody can make him be a daddy to your baby if he doesn't want to be.  Since he isn't married to you he doesn't have to be there for you.  The best thing you can do for yourself, is to finish school, support your baby and yourself and don't waste your time on someone who doesn't even want to admit he had sex with you.|`|mrysAOpGaa	get a DNA test to prove that he's the fatehr, and if he still doesnt want to be involved that just shows how much of a loser he is who cant handle responsibility, so take him fo ras much child suppoert as you possibly can.  Truth is sweetie, you can make a man a father, it takes a boy to become a father, but it takes a man to BE a father, and obviously he isnt mant enough. I know this hurts you, and youre scared to raise this baby alone, but you can do it, trust me.  If he is gong to act like that, he's not worth your time, nor is he worth the babys time, and the two of you deserve so much more, and better.|`|RLoilwCNaa	One a DNA test when the kid is born will take care of that. He'll be paying you child support for the next 18 years also. If he doens't want to be there for you screw him, there's nothing you can do about that, but I guarantee he'll pay. If not he'll go to jail. Find a way to get some schooling even after it's born. You kid will thank you for it.

67989651fa22e1e5264bb57e77eb8e16aa	You don't say that you know this girl other than texting.  Did you get really close by only texting?   If that be the case just text her and tell her that you've been texting with no response.  Tell her it is her time now and she won't hear from you again until you hear from her.  If you know her personally and have been around her, dating and all that, she at least owes you an explanation.  Sounds like you may have just taken the backseat for someone new.  Be up front and ask her if she is still  interested  in you or the texting if you get no reply then at least you got an answer.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	You're young and no doubt you'll meet other girls...texting is a for of communication only, it is not a relationship BUILDER.

PuqlSfKcaa	If you have been together for this long, why have you not figured out why he doesn't want to get married. I mean, some people may be scared of long term commitment. Being in a long term relationship is very much different from a marriage. Marriage means one. You shouldn't pry to hard, but maybe you should have a nice, calm chat about it.<br>  If he isn't into talking about it, well then you have to decide. Personally, do you really want to spend your life with someone who wont marry you? Or would you mind commitment without the marriage? Getting a home together is a commitment, but it also leaves it open.<br>  If it were my situation, I would stick to what I said. Maybe the separation will show you both how much you mean to each other. Then he may come around. If not, you will know your answer. It will hurt, but at least you wont be spending your life wanting marriage and never receiving it.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well he has everything he wants- he lives with you and you have his kid, so you're locked in for life basically, without marriage.  he knows even if you split with him, he'll see you when he visits the boy so what incentive does he have to actually commit to you?  ask him if he has fears about a wedding and tell him you don't have to do it in front of 200 people if he doesn't want.  but if you've issued him an ultimatum, you have to stick with it or he'll know for SURE you're a pushover and he can get away with anything he wants without fear of you leaving him.|`|joiacDUdaa	Well, this is the classic scenario of "putting the cart before the horse."  Why get married in the first place.. You already live together AND you have a child together.  What's getting married going to accomplish?  If he hasn't proposed he isn't going to and you are just making it too easy for him... Why not just leave him and find someone that actually wants to get married and have  family.  <br>  <br>        I speak from experience.. I dated my now husband for over 8 yrs. I wanted to live together, get engaged and married... He kept stalling and stalling until finally I'd had enough.  I moved out of my apt.  and basically broke things off.  I spent a year or so- going to school, traveling and dating other people.  It was a much needed break.  He hung out with his friends and whatever. He says he dated but, his sister said, "he didn't".... Anyway- he found that he truly did miss me and wanted to be together.  So, he called.   I ignored the first 6 calls, he wrote a letter..  I sent it back "Return to sender".   Finally, on my birthday he wrote a heartfelt letter, and drove it to my house which was 45 min away from where he works... Put it in my car and left a rose.... NOW that's what I'm talking about!  He really did miss me and finally WE as a couple were on the same page... WE decided to move in together, get engaged and get married... After almost 6 yrs. of marriage we have two children and are doing just fine... If we didn't take the "break"  we would be very, very miserable....  Some men just need a kick in the butt.... If he's NOT happy he's NOT going to propose so no ultimatum is going to work.. You have to leave and make him pay child support etc... Go on with your life and find someone that wants to make you happy....<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qVL5R8nuaa	This should not be confusing. It is clear as day. He does not wish to marry you. Repeat, he does not wish to marry you. That is his right. If this bothers you, you should move on and find someone who will. Otherwise, just accept it.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	well, see, now your f****d. because he is a guy, he is going to wait that last month just to test if you actually will up and leave him.  <br>  <br>    and asking him every four months isnt a good way to get what you want either.<br>  <br>  he's working on the philosophy of why go buy milk when he already has the cow at home?  you have a baby, you live together, in his eyes, theres no need for getting married cause you already have everything that comes after it|`|R7b150Iyaa	You gave him an ultimatum, you have to stick to your guns.  Maybe if you leave (or make him leave, whichever), he will come around and propose after realizing what a fool he was for losing you in the first place, or maybe he won't and you will have to move on.  Unfortunately, you don't have much of a choice in the matter: you want to get married, and it doesn't seem like he does. Stick to your ultimatum, because you will ultimately wind up bitter and resentful towards him if he never marries you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're in this situation.  That's why I really believe in marriage BEFORE starting a family together.  In his mind, you already have a child together, so why should he propose if everything is already the way he likes?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	The first answerer hit the nail on the head.  He does not see marriage anywhere within the near future, regardless of the having a child with you.<br>  <br>  Ultimatums aren't the way to go.  Have a heart to heart talk with him and discuss how important it is to you and that you want to marry him.  Tell him the future of BOTH your lives is going to be changed, one way or another, by his decision.  If he makes it clear again that he does not want marriage, then leave.<br>  <br>  Don't waste time with someone who wants to play games.  Life is too short.  Make your own happiness without him.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	your giving the milk for free why would he buy the cow??!! He isnt gonna commit when he doesnt have to be smart!|`|CkN4pgpCaa	When you give someone an ultimatum, you have to be prepared to stick to it.  If you don't stick with it, then it will seem as though it's not really that important to you.  You'll have to choose... would you rather stay with him and possibly never be married?  Or leave the situation and go after what you want?  I can't tell you if you'd be happier with one or the other.  But I do think that you should stick to your guns.. if you give him the decision and he makes it, don't keep giving him more chances to disappoint you with those decisions.  <br>  <br>  Good luck:)|`|EiQtzZHPaa	you have already made the decision to share your lives together so obviously that i not what is bothering him,i no its ridiculous to suggest that you ask him why because some how they always avoid answering questions like that but maybe there is something else on his mind if its a commitment problem you need to snap him back into reality,having a baby is about as committed as you can get! or there is the possibility that its about money,in that case no matter how you cut it he just does not respect you enough ,there are also men out there who just insist on staying single as a way of feeling less obligated to there ladies,bottom line is it is your turn now to call the shoots tell him make a honest women out of you now! before you turn out like one of those gross old biker couples who get married in there sixties with the grand kids in the audience|`|QmG2v1quaa	The sad thing is, is that once this month is over and he hasn't proposed you're probably still not going to leave him. Well just what is that going to teach him? I think since you gave him an ultimatum then you need to stick to it if he does not follow through. I know you don't want to break up your family, but sometimes you have to take drastic measures to get what you want. You have been living with him for 5 years. Why would he marry you when he already gets everything he wants? <br>  <br>  I'm really not trying to be mean. I'm just trying to be honest.<br>  <br>  If he has not proposed by then end of the month then you need to leave. If he really wants you, he WILL propose to you. Maybe not at the end of the month, but he will eventually. <br>  <br>  Stick to your guns. If you don't leave he will never take you seriously. If he doesn't take you seriously he will never propose to you!!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	He didn't take you seriously and thinks your joking. Maybe he loves you but isn't IN LOVE with you. Maybe he doesn't want to marry you. Maybe he just isn't willing. There just so many "maybes" just kick him to the curb if by next month there no " will you marry me ". Or maybe he willing to when he  can be the "Man" in the relationship and foot all the bills. Some man have the mind set that they would only get marry if they can really take care of the family & if they can't then they just don't get married.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Why would he marry you...he has all the perks of a marriage without any of the legal ties/obligations and responsibilities except child support if he chooses to take a hike...he has probably realized that if the marriage ended he would owe you 1/2 of the stuff you share plus possibly maintenance, a portion of his assets, etc.....this way he can just up and leave anytime he wishes and you, M'dear, are screwed.<br>  <br>  He will not marry you. Accept it and live with it or cut your losses and leave.|`|uGinKU6Baa	Although the "cow and milk" scenario came to mind..it's not always true..especially as of late in these times. <br>  <br>  It's most likely that your boyfriend doesn't want to wreck what the 2 of you already have via the stresses of marriage. If your relationship is strong and worthwhile..is giving him a ultimatum of a engagement/wedding ring and possibly losing him really worth it??<br>  <br>  I have a relative who was with his girlfriend for over 9 years..purchased homes and cars together and raised 2 kids..they just got married the other day..not due to societies pressure(s), but due to the fact that they were ready to make that next step.<br>  <br>  All of the best,|`|QYZNLyKoaa	first off i say right on to the time limit. second, when the month is up, he gave you his answer.|`|f2RpmfFOaa	kick him out now and see if he comes back.
1675552670f751f69f7fd1f8212b59e7aa	Correct me if I'm wrong but you sound young and it sounds like you both are playing games.  Stop making each other jealous because that's very immature.  If a guy really likes you, he'll be with you no matter what.  He'd also stop playing around.  Girls mature faster then guys, they always play around to much.  Then when they really want to be with you its too late!  So put that head up high and don't settle for less.  Make your standards high no meaning like some rich guy just a nice guy that's not immature because remember your better then that!  Show him your mature!  That your not going to play those games.  If he really likes you he'll be there if not its time to move on.  Life is to short sweetie you don't want to regret!|`|PdIRHRZgaa	just get over him.

FFE9Qztzaa	Yes, It definitely can be. Especially when I myself have shown and displayed my feelings, to him.. but don't get the same feedback from him. Then to me, I would really want him to open up and let me how he feels about me, or about anything I would like to know. In some cases, on must gain MORE of their trust and actually have them feel much comfortable around you in order to let those feelings come to the surface.<br>  <br>  Another thing It might frustrate me is, when a guy does not want to discuss or show their deep feeling , then it just instantly makes me feel a bit insecure and wonder if there is something or anything wrong with that perhaps is keeping him from being that way,.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	If a gentleman friend of mine began going on about his deep feelings, I'd run for the hills.

Not that a woman has to do that, but everyone should be able to take care of themselves, at the very least).  It's also true that a lot of American men can't find someone to marry until they are in their late 30's when they get desperate and go overseas (because a lot of Asian brides will marry anyone just for a greencard).

BGIxDWkZaa	Any number of reasons that you have mentioned many. When I was paying support I made all of my payments. I was late, but they were all made. However when the ex lost custody, and she was ordered to pay support she never paid a dime. I think, she thought if she moved far enough away she wouldn't get caught. I never pushed the issue. Yeah I could have used the money, and so could have my kids. In the long run we were all better off without her in our lives. She recently died owing me thousands. <br>  <br>  To answer your question. Most cannot afford it. It's roughly one third of ones income. Which may be fine if you are single. However if you rush out and get married again that will could certainly cut into the second family. Courts tend to look at the kids that were there first get what is owed them first.<br>  <br>  Some are mad at the ex. Mine was. She figured she was punishing me, by not supporting her children.<br>  <br>  My ex never did see her kids after the divorce. That was on her. I encouraged her to stay in touch and see them. She chose not to see them. Her loss She died having grandchildren she never knew about.<br>  <br>  Supposedly there are government agencies that will enforce support. I never could get any assistance.|`|T526fAIeaa	my parents pay child support.<br>  Mainly becuase the opposite parental whom is forced to pay, believes that its not fair that they cannot see their own child, as well as have to pay for it as well! The whole point of having your child is to spend precious moments with them! and buy them stuff. Not just the buying part! Its frusterating as a parent, and its not really invisible to the child either!|`|IgaW4g8Naa	I pay mine, but then again my ex and I worked out our own agreement and it is more fair than the court version.  with that said I believe that the biggest problem is a lack of accountability on how the money is spent.  I believe that the receiving parent should have to keep a ledger and justify where the money goes.  this system is to easily and too often abused.|`|AA10243185	I made my son and i will pay to support him. Alot of people do it out of spite to make thing harder on the ex.

Not everyone is a dead beat like you're presuming!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  May I add, that all too often, she refuses to let him see his own child?|`|jBigEy0Caa	My husband has always paid.  He never tried to get out of it and always felt it was his responsibility.|`|S6dM85fxaa	Not all.  I'm going through a divorce.  If ordered to pay, i will because i love my kids.  but we own 2 businesses and a very nice home.  I offered her both businesses, the home, and everything we accumulated over 13 yrs of marriage if she lets me keep the little bit of money i make now that i have a new job.  it took her months to decide, but begrudgingly she finally said ok.  I don't understand why she wouldn't jump on that offer.  If we start to split assests, she stands to lose A LOT and the kids will suffer.  But the path we take will be her choice.  We can start dividing stuff or she can keep everything.  Why are women so greedy in divorce?<br>  <br>  If you have any advice i'd SURE LOVE TO HEAR IT.|`|tA1ztvXaaa	I really believe that yes there are some VINDICTIVE people both men and women out here who for the life of me I can't understand why they would do this.  some women take it out on men because of the circumstance of their break up and some men neglect their child becaose of a new relationship, regardless, If YOU ever have to go to court whether you're the plaintiff or defendent there is a good reason why.  People complain that men don't have rights they do, IF You're a good husband, father or boyfriend who is EASY to talk to, issues would never get into the court.  People complain judges are prejudice and against men, that's not the law of the land.  I dated a man who's EX wife was putting him through child support at first I couldn't understand, why she did that I felt at first she was being a bitter *****.  It wasn't until years later did I understand it, this man was abusive emotionally, dominating and controlling.  I met him loved his son as mind use to go grocery shopping even for the kid, and he up until he met me NEVER thought once about shopping for his kids lunch for the week.  He felt that I can see my son every other weekend anad give this ***** money that's all i need to do.  PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE MORE ACTIVE ROLES IN THE KIDS LIFE.  because the truth is if you do, act like adults the the courts will never have to mediate your dead beat issues<br>  <br>  I just want to add that not because you pay child support automically makes you a good parent.  MONEY can never replace the true meaning of being a parent.  Don't be bitter people if you're paying child support and your ex is not letting you see your child go back to the courts and DEMAND that you do, stop sitting around on your  laurels and letting it be ...for the record...THERE IS NEVER A FINAL JUDGEMENT IN CHILD CUSTODY CASES.  So if your ex had your child circumstances can change and he or she can end up having that child again.  STAND up for your child because some day that same child may be the one changing your DEPENDS|`|RQvLrKMXaa	I can only speak for myself, but the reason I hated paying is every dime that I payed in child support was spent on drugs for my ex and her bf, at the time.  Nothing was spent on the children.  Then there is the fact that after nagging me about adopting her children for three years, less than 6 months after the adoption was finalized she filed for divorce and support.  Her first husband, the children's biological father, refused to pay support and when dragged into court over it he just quit his job.  So it appeared to me that the only reason for her nagging me into adopting her children ws to get support from me.  BTW, I paid until they were 23 and 24 respectively, both were married and both had children of their own!|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Good question.  I think it has to do with the the non custodial parent not wanting to give the other parent money, even if it is for the child.  They probably think that they are going to blow it on themselves or actually pay bills with it to help support their child.<br>  I don't have personal experience with someone not paying, my ex husband did, and my husband pays his religiously.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	I've asked this question before to. Don't expect to get to many people who owe actually going to fess up. Mine doesn't pay a dime court ordered and he chooses not to work and scrub off anyone he can. <br>  so many very sad dead beats men or women out there. They need to get it through their thick skull it DOES NOT MATTER how better their ex is doing the money is for the CHILDREN.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	it starts right from the court process they make the man feel like a heel as soon as he goes in there men are not told their rights only the woman if the court were a little more fair this would be easier for men to want to pay in most cases it is really not the money i do pay mine with pride but i have seen how us men are treated it is not fair at all|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I can't imagine not taking care of my offspring. However, I have seen cases where the support was ordered, then the spouse loses or changes jobs and is making far less than before. And he just can't pay it and before you say, "go back to court" remember lawyers want to be paid and by the time the support payer gets behind, they can't afford an attorney. One case where the guy said just get me away from her. He signed the papers. Big mistake.. He was working 60 to 70 hrs a week to pay the support and she was spending it at the spa. Getting toned up... I think that it has gotten better but, in the past the judge would just break the man. She got the gold mine and he got the shaft thing.. You remember that!! To answer your question...|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I'll tell you why. Because when you have a vindictive ex, hell bent on screwing you over using the system, and the way the laws are crafted, if actually ENCOURAGES mothers to use it to screw over father's...it turns a good dad into a deadbeat, but is he really a deadbeat or the mom for unnecessarily using the state's resources to screw him over?<br>  <br>  I'll give you an example I gave when I was presenting a case for reform in child support laws.<br>  <br>  A dad that makes 10.00 per hour will make 1600 per month gross. In Texas where they take the net income of a parent and also require them to have the child on their health insurance, here is an accounting of what happens:<br>  <br>  Gross Pay: 1600.00<br>  <br>  Net less taxes - 1248.00<br>  <br>  Net less required insurance premium - 1045.00<br>  <br>  After child support - 745.00<br>  <br>  After Rent - 145.00<br>  <br>  Light bill - 70.00<br>  <br>  Gas : -130.00<br>  <br>  Car note : -430.00<br>  <br>  Food: - 630.00<br>  <br>  You can see where I'm going with this.<br>  <br>  State's RARELY take into consideration how a parent is to survive upon separation of the relationship with the mother. Mom, because she has custody can get on all kinds of state assistance, where Dad gets a second job...and when he does so, therefore increases his income, and then mom takes him back to increase his support payment, because he got a job so that he can have the basic necessities.<br>  <br>  You want to know why GOOD PARENTS become deadbeats? it starts with hell bent mothers and a judicial system that accepts them screwing over dad's.
kUE3Ddktaa	It's hard to tell in photos, because those models are all airbrushed and spray-tanned. But I'm one of those fair-skinned people who looks better in ivory - bright white makes me look sallow. I can tell the difference when I look at the colors, but it becomes really obvious when I put them on.<br>  <br>  My advice is to try on dresses in several shades of white and ivory to figure out what looks best with your complexion.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Yes, you can tell the white is brighter. White looks "cooler", and ivory (depending on the shade) looks warmer and sometimes even yellow-ish.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I think it's a big difference...  White is vibrant and bright...  Ivory is softer and a different tone...<br>  <br>  It all depends on the fabric too... But, nonetheless, there is a difference :)|`|F4k68ilkaa	The Ivory is more cream colored, and less white. <br>  <br>  The white is WAY brighter, IMHO.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I went last Saturday to go pick out my dress. While I was browsing around at what they had I could tell the difference between white and ivory. for me white was the way to go. Ivory has more of a light tan feel to it (if I described it right) for some people both colors work for me it was just white that caught my eye. On a computer you cannot tell the difference but in person you can. I was going to order my dress online but because I didn't know my size I decided to do in person in which was great because i would have got the wrong size and ended up with a dress that wouldn't have fit. Pick out what works for you and what catches your eye. I went in with an idea of my ideal wedding dresses, tried them on and they were not what I wanted. Someone on here told me to listen to the attendant if she offers a dress and that's what I did, I loved the dress and came home with it. I got my dress at Davids Bridal.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No. Unless you are wearing the white or ivory and standing next to something that is stark white, you won't be able to tell a difference, and even then it's difficult in most cases. Your guests certainly won't notice so don't worry about it.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	i thin you can definitely tell once you are comparing both of them..<br>  <br>  when i went to the store i looked at the yvory/off white dresses and then looked at the white ones..and yes you can tell <br>  also white looks really bright...like the snow almost.. Yvory has a little hint of beige in it but not that much..|`|q8eue7CRaa	The white is a lot brighter. It definitely matters with coordinating your shoes and veil. The variety is there to make sure it flatters your skin tone, etc, and if you borrow an old veil, that veil will fade and match ivory instead of white, for example.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I look much better in ivory. My skin has red undertones, so in bright white I look pinker than I usually do. Ivory complements me. Yes, you can tell, but its not a big deal.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	No, there's no big difference. If you hold up a white dress to an ivory dress you'll see it but mine was ivory and by itself you would have never known.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Yes.  The white is more white.  It's not HUGE difference (unless you get champagne) until you have it against your skin tone.  One color will wash you out.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Its not a big difference in my opinion, I think both are gorgeous|`|3WQOa4sraa	well it depends by the designer of the dress, I have seen ivory that looks more or less white but sometimes a dress in ivory can look very cream so check it out before you order.<br>  <br>  you can only tell the difference if the ivory is placed beside a pure white colour<br>  <br>  sometimes pure white dresses can be shocking and almost blind you to look at it, I have chosen a dress that comes in "dark white" white is a sort of pearl white but not shocking (you can also get diamond white and antique white)<br>  <br>  go with whatever suits your skin tone best :)|`|CsdJNke9aa	As long as you don't stand by something white you can't tell the difference. I had an ivory dress, not white since I am so pale it looked better on me. Nobody knew it wasn't white. Just remember to make sure the groomsmen shirts are ivory and not white with there tuxes or it will make your dress look dingy. The tux place suggested this to me, as I didn't even think about it at the time.|`|EGao9rQKaa	my first wedding, i wore a white wedding dress..but i was in florida and was tan..i'm usually as white as the wall.<br>  my second wedding (the ONLY one in my mind ), i wore ivory becuz i live in NC and was my pasty self lol <br>  so there is a difference...usually u look better in stark white if you have some color to you and you look better in ivory if you are very fair skinned.<br>  you can tell the difference in pictures..i could anyways. the thing is though, i all depends on the dress and the different designers. one ivory dress could look very white compared to another ivory dress.<br>  i'm kind of rambling but i hope i helped!|`|Au32tyxGaa	Well when you try them on, there are. When I was trying on dresses the Ivory looked WAAY better with my skin tone.<br>  <br>  And there are some dresses that are More ivory than others. It realy just depends on the dress|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Oh yes, HUGE difference. In person, you can definitely tell that the white is brighter!!!!!!|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	uuumm..yes.  if you go in the store to look you will definitely see a difference|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I think so, you wouldn't think it's a big diff but once you see it in person it really is bright white.  and not every skin tone looks great in bright white.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I no many have said no, but in all honesty I believe there is.  The difference can be subtle though depending on the dress and material.  However, not all look good in white so some opt for ivory.  In the end though, the difference is usually minimal so pick whatever color looks good on you.
JvY5KL22aa	I'm a little confused, maybe I just read it wrong. But didn't you say, " think the reason is because my whole life all of my friends have been nothing but backstabbers"?? Then you said, "I feel terrible because my friends have never given me reason not to trust them" ... I don't know. Anyways, I've had a lot of friends who back stabbed me and turned out to be fake people who lie about everything under the sun. But for those who don't do that kind of stuff to me I tell them I love them. If I were you I'd take them out and treat them to something that I know they absolutely love, sometimes like on special occasions! And you could receive the same in return. Or sit around and have a movie night and just talk and catch up. Of course, you might have a moment during the night when you all get mushy with each other and tell each other why you appreciate the things you do for one another and then we just carry on with the jokes. I think that'd be nice for you and your friends.|`|rhTCejrtaa	I'd recommend writing each person an individual note with a pretty card or something. Tell them how you feel about them and how happy you are to have them in your life. Or get a thoughtful gift.|`|aqY13vWNaa	Invite them all to a coffee, and make 'em laugh to remember the old good times!|`|arjadO5daa	Just take them out somewhere, and try and organize it, they will think you care about them. It helps when Me and My Friends get in an argument!|`|cxPQzqqqaa	lie to them. tell them what they want to hear.|`|wp3vYFB9aa	it depends on your relationship with your friends.. it seems like maybe u spend a lot of time with your boyfriend but not enough with your friends, or maybe u just dont get along with them( that happens sometimes- plus u said they are backstabbers)<br>  <br>  if u want- try to set a time when they get special attention.. i know when my friend had a boyfriend she wouldnt hang out much anymore, i felt like i was betrayed until she finally told me she was sorry for not hanging out like we used too. I realized that i was being selfish as a friend and she was being selfish with her boyfriend.. i dont think people can help it when they are in love... so try to explain it to them and set some fun stuff to do.. if they still are mean about it just let it go.<br>  <br>  his sister is probably around so much because thats her brother and maybe she feels he gives too much attention to you... sharing is the easiest way to get past the feeling of selfishness on both parts..<br>  hope i helped :)|`|MrLdBraoaa	How about you tell them what you just typed? As a friend i would apreciate you for it.|`|r8LJEJwbaa	Invite them over, deliberately talk to them. Make them feel wanted by you.
8x9Fz6b4aa	the best thing for you do to is to just find someone to hang around with, being alone is a big cause of wanting something to end. its extremely depressing, and your not the only one, find something to do, a hobby or a sport. getting involved in a team activity can dramatically improve your mood. it will give you less time to think of wanting it all to end. instead you will be thinking about what you can do to get better or help others. bottom line, be with people who like wat you like. if there is ever an opportunity to do something or someone asked you to go somewhere, do it, (unless its some kinda of sick twisted activity). you will on find your self thinking about it later and how you should have done it. i guess wat im saying is, do something that will keep you from thinking. forget the  problems, they are only problems if you make them problems. brush all incidents aside and move forward. just do wat you have to do, and don't worry about fulfilling others problems and wants. im not saying that helping others is wrong, its just that at a time like this you gotta focus on number one, and that of course is you|`|ojqWNSJMaa	John; go to a church group, start with going to church this sunday, try to talk to the minister or pasture and explain that you need to interact with someone that can help you with some personal problems.<br>  Let us know how you make out, we do care.|`|dhFgIFCraa	what are your problems?  Ask yourself, how would you look at this situation if your friend came to you with these problems?  how would you look at this 5 years from now?  i suggest talking to a psychologist before you make any decisions... life is so beautiful, these problems are only thrown at you to make you stronger... remember that!
uBssj3Znaa	You pushed him out the door. Try being friends with him for a while and learn how to deal with your jealous. Guys don't like being constantly accused or have their stuff gone through. Give it some time and see where it goes, but don't be surprised if you two never get back together.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	the one thing is you have your daughter so concentrate on being friends for her sake then maybe once you have established that you maybe can work on your relationship and see if you can get back together you have to learn to start trusting him|`|M5hzHHvtaa	well to be honest all you can do now is let go of the jealousy and just be friends for a while...you need to trust him more...because in order for a relationship to work you both need to trust each other...and right about now you don't trust him.<br>  <br>  so be friends for a while...its not going to be easy for you but im sure it won't be easy for him either...he will come back to you if you change..you've been with this man for 4 years now...that's a very long time and you also have a baby with him...<br>  <br>  you need to give him space and hope for the best.|`|TCVKpfeJaa	People who become defensive like that usually have something to hide.  Your actions should depend on whether you really want to continue this relationship.  Take a deep breath and look inside yourself: if he won't be open and honest with you, do you really want to pursue him?  If so, you're going to have to give over to trust, and not snoop.  On the other hand, if you don't think you can trust him, then why be with him?<br>  <br>  The foundation of a good relationship is being able to trust each other.  If he has lost your trust, and done nothing to gain it back, then your relationship is in trouble.  On the other hand if you don't have any DEFINITE proof that he did something wrong, maybe you are overreacting.<br>  <br>  A lot of it is how you respond to the situation.  For instance, the night he didn't call you but called others should have had a response similar to, "It hurt my feelings when I went through your phone and saw you returned other people's calls but not mine.  I'm sorry I disregarded your right to privacy, but I just feel like we're having problems...etc."  More than likely (if you are like me) your response was, "Why were you willing to call other people back, but not me?  What did I do so that you won't return my calls?" and on the cozy co-worker, "Why are you two texting like that?  That is not how co-workers should talk to each other."  By having flirty texts he was sending a message that he was available, even though he wasn't.  He was opening himself up to a possibility even though he probably wouldn't have cheated.  He disregarded your feelings, your relationship, and your trust.<br>  <br>  Unless your overreacting, I think you should seriously reconsider this guy.<br>  <br>  I understand that having a child puts added stress on both of you.  Try not to take his distance as a threat, but remember what you said.  He is worn out from a day of baby labor (and kids are serious work, I know!).  <br>  <br>  If you want to continue your relationship, work on how you talk to him.  If you show him that you care, that you want a good relationship, he might respond more candidly.  On the reverse, if you continue a series of blaming accusations, you will push him away.

ANY sexual contact can result in an STD, ANY swapping of bodily fluids can result in becoming HIV positive. It all depends on with whom one is having sex with. <br>  <br>  Also most people who are practicing an alternative lifestyle such as swinging and/or polyamory are much more conscientious about taking safer sex precautions than the average person. The majority of the people engaging in these lifestyles have regular testing and check-ups and use condoms and dental dams. Ignorance is what allows the breeding of STDs and AIDS, not promiscuity.|`|dprURFLxaa	I totally agree with you.

There are people on here who will make judgmental comments when presented with a questioner who has had 30 partners.  I also think its fair to say there is a difference between sex within the context of a relationship and swinging or having a threesome (I have had a threesome and loved it!).  <br>  <br>  A multi-partner scenario necessarily means sex outside any relationship.  I recognize you may have engaged in this activity for the purpose of enhancing an existing relationship, and it may be 100% safe and consensual, but you are still sleeping with someone you don't intimately care about.  Its sex for sex's sake.  I'm not casting judgment, but you must realize its not crazy to suggest that is promiscuous by the normal definition in the prevailing culture. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if I were to say I've "slept with 30 guys" (the real number for me is less than 10, counting both of the guys in the threesome), you can't tell if I did any or all while in a committed relationship or in a wanton fashion.  Its difficult to make any judgment at all.  If I say "I've slept with 30 guys this week" then you have some more information to decide how you feel about it.<br>  <br>  In the end, I'm not sure your reaction is any more grounded than the one you mock.  You knew how this behavior is viewed by many people, you can't complain about the comments you knew would come afterward, even when they are illogical.  If you want to change how people look at swingers, I think you're going about it the wrong way.  I also think putting yourself out there on Y!A is agreeing to the whole spectrum of respones wether you like them or not.

GfCRiueRaa	I know, it's pretty annoying. They think that instead of addressing the problem directly and resolving the issues so that everything is clear, the better solution would be to ignore it and hope it fades away.

If he still doesn't listen, just give it a little more time.|`|4IHe4rPYaa	because they dont want to talk to you. they dont care about you anymore.|`|2vgbJhlRaa	people ignore you because of what you just said! you had your answer in your explanation lol. because if you try to talk you get REAL nasty and end up saying things you regret. yea its ok to get emotional especially if its a touchy subject like that but no its not ok to say things that you normally wouldnt out of rage. bottom line...sometimes its best to let things cool off. if you really care for the other person you will understand what is going on. best of luck and hang in there|`|AA10737067	Maybe you should try and explain to him what was going on in your mind, and how you miss his friendship.

Not in a way that makes it look like you're trying to control him or prevent him from spending time with his friend, but in "It's a shame I won't be able to stay up that late. I'm really wanting to spend some time out with you. Let's make a date when I will be able to join you." Or maybe, "Oh good, so if you're not going out with him until so late we'll be able to go to dinner earlier in the evening. That'll be nice." Something like that.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	sounds like he only asked you to go with to see what you would say. I don't think he was counting on you saying yes to going out. I also think once he found out you were going, him and his buddy changed the plan, with him knowing you would not go for you having to get up early for work. I would be a little pissed myself. I would call up his buddy and see if he could talk to your husband into changing the plans for friday instead of thursday. It might just be me, but something sounds fishy here.|`|AA11596133	WOW.  Your husband is a selfish jerk.  Obviously he changed the plans knowing you could not go.  Makes me wonder WHY.  If I were you, I would go to bed early that night, set your alarm for say 2 am, they drive by this "friends" house and knock on the door.  Why not?|`|3yNh5jO8aa	You need to talk to him or go with him. This is not right on his part.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You're overreacting. What are they going to see, The Rocky Horror Picture Show?|`|bQpIctgPaa	You should spontaneously jump aboard for the outing as he leaves.  Tell him you have really been looking forward to the movie and spending time with him and his friend and having a good time.  Tell him you made a point of taking a nap after work so you would be well rested and don't take no for an answer!  You'll find out real quickly whether he's really up to no good, because something will suddenly come up and his "friend" won't be able to make it!|`|q411DXsFaa	Sounds like he may rather hang out with the guys.  Talk to him. He could be hiding something and he asked you to go, figuring you would say no and then you said yes and it threw him off! So he picked a date when he knew you couldn't come.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Take a sick day and then you have no reason to get up the next day.

Unfortunately, there probably isn't a whole lot you can do to change his plans other than telling him how it makes you feel. <br>  <br>  Maybe the two of you could go see another movie to make up for it? Try to spend some time with him and if he keeps making plans with other people and cancelling on you, it's time for the two of you to sit down and have a talk.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	Well, he's entitled to go out with his mates.  Just because he's married to you, doesn't mean that he shouldn't be able to go out without you.  <br>  <br>  It's not his fault that you're unable to go.  At least he did as you, though.  He had already made plans, so I think it is unreasonable to expect him to change them.|`|qf0kuMCiaa	It may  be nothing, I tell my hubby things like this not to go out that late but things like honey do you want to go with me to do this... then change  my mind later just because I really want time for myself, not cheat or anything but just to be free..|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	excuse me ~ your husband said you CAN'T go with them because you have to get up early to go to work?

1UiYpUWiaa	you seem to know what you want, having 1 good friend is perfectly fine and you sound like you don't have time for many friends so it works good with your life at the moment.<br>  however the "where my real life will be" part sounds problematic, your life should be real enough right now and if they aren't then you need to improve them, you can't just look at high school as a stage or you might find yourself moving from one stage to another.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	you can never have too many friends :) i'm your friend. :)|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	I reallly only had one close friend most of my life.

I'm in high school too and I have one best friend, who unfortunately doesn't go to my school. In class, I always have people to talk to, but outside of school I don't really hang out with any classmates that much. Honestly, I was like you for a while and I always thought that I needed more friends. But then I realized that life's not about how many friends you have and especially since we're only in high school, it's not something to worry about. College will be the time to really just have fun and be adventurous. Right now, I'm focused on my sports and clubs that I belong to and of course, academics. But really, it's only high school - it's four years. and i'm really glad that I have my best friend to lean on, because I know that all those popular kids in school right now will probably keep in touch with like one person from school, but i know i've always got my best friend and when it comes down to it, that's the only friend that really matters.|`|8ygYvN1Caa	No it's really not that bad to have 1 friend but when its time to graduate u wanna look back to the memories and think about ur friends|`|Jfa0QcBsaa	whatever make you the happiest|`|LrW1XXMIaa	you are probuly a neerd but just be you'er self

My ex is very resentful about it. Delightful.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	No he can be forced to pay child support based on his "earning potential" versus his actual earnings.  It depends on the state but I can't see them dropping support all together because then the state would have to take over with payments in the form of welfare.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	He's in for some sh!t. I'm sure he has a job, probaly being paid under the table so they can't see how much he's making. HE can actually get prison time for this. It won't be dropped at all. another thing in some states if the father isn't paying the support, then the court won't allow him any visitation. <br>  <br>  He's only hurting him self. They could also take any tax returns he may have and give that to you.|`|OBCvewW2aa	No, he can't have it dropped, but he can have it modified.  Also, there's no child support police waiting in the bushes for deadbeats.  So if he doesn't pay, he pretty much gets away with it.  <br>  <br>  Some people care about things like honoring debts and good credit, but not deadbeats.  That's the conundrum.  How do we punish deadbeats?|`|xGofrX5Iaa	He is taking you to court to have them make his child support a percentage of his income. Since he has no income it would be 0. However unemployment benefits do count, and he will have to get a job at some point. But basically he is trying to screw you out of your money. Also 69 dollars a week is nothing in child support. Kids cost money. He should be paying more than that. It's only ten dollars a day. What a loser.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	If he isn't working and doesn't have any moeny coming in, then he can't very well pay you, can he?|`|AA11857949	He cant get out of it, the judge will make him get a job and pay or he will go to jail. He can go collect pop bottles if you living in a state that has a return on them to pay child support. I live in michigan and that happened to a friend of mine, that he could either pay it or go to jail, he ended up borrowing the money to pay it hope this helps.|`|fIVzMoY8aa	A court can "impute" income to someone.  In other words, if the court thinks that he isn't working, but that he COULD be working (he's not disabled, etc.), then they can say, essentially, "hey, buddy, you could go out there and get SOME kind of a job and earn $X per week, so I'm going to order you to pay $Y per week in child support."  <br>  That's what you or your attorney should argue at the court appearance.<br>  <br>  Karen<br>  www.parkavenueguidetodivorce.typepad.c...|`|7563c0927d6a304ee3cb66ffa4aab34faa	Nope.

What happens is even though he isn't paying, the tab is racking up.|`|MG1IVmvIaa	no he can't if he is behind he has to pay, send the deadbeat to jail if he don't want to work...
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	when your married u have to allow your spouse  time to have a life to. if u don't he will for sure want a divorce. your spouse is immature and insecure. and also controlling.u need to insist she agree to therapy, they sometimes can offer it free at your church. she is selfish, and if u want to keep your spouse from leaving u, u have to learn to give. playing cards and going to the gym isn't cheating. u really should have gotten to know this woman better before u married her or had any children with her.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Oh god, you shouldn't  have one child, never mind three.

I think the best thing to do is to get marriage counseling. <br>  Don't give up on your marriage. Try to work it out.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Answer is to both get a job and stop having children. If you have that much time to play games you have time to work.|`|4KzNasrvaa	You two sound as if youre 18, maybe 19 at best. Good luck on continuing to grow up, youre going to need it.|`|cvhIAd6baa	Right now she is prego let her be spend time with the kids dont let it always be her job seriously and no divorce get counselin if needed but dont be a dick about anything you will destroy her heart|`|sLLgERQWaa	And you all are HOW OLD???????? You want a serious answer....here's one, Hon...<br>  <br>  GROW UP THE BUNCH OF YOU....OMG children having children.......|`|fc4NOCp3aa	I would seek marriage counseling first but if that isn't working after 6 months-1 year, then yes, I would consider divorce.  Too often couples justify staying "because of the kids", when in reality, you're probably doing more damage than anything to them by staying together.  Children need to grow up seeing a HEALTHY, adult, mature, and loving example of a relationship in order for them to have the same when they grow up.  What children grow up around feels "normal" to them when they are adults.  Think about it - do you repeat some of the same bad habits in r'ships that you saw in your own family members growing up as a little boy?  I'm guessing you probably do.  Kids essentially start out with a bad perspective if they've had to grow up in a house that doesn't value communication, love, thoughtfulness, etc.  <br>  <br>  The 2 of you need to sit down and have a long talk.  If it starts to get heated, stop, the 2 of you go to separate rooms, calm down, and then come back.  But the key here is, you guys need to define what is truly important to you in this marriage and for yourselves individually.  You're going to school is important because your degree will help build a better life for your family in the future.  She needs to not only understand that but be supportive of it in any way she can - that includes not demanding all your time so you can actually study & get good grades!  And you need to realize that if she's giving up all this time with you, then when you DO have spare time, you need to give it to your FAMILY (meaning her & the children).  Your actions need to show her how important she is to you - and the kids as well.  If you're constantly leaving the house to go play cars with your brother, all that says to your wife & kids is that "they are low on the priority list."  You can tell a person all day long how much you love them but if your actions don't back it up, they are just useless words.  I'm guessing your wife is sick & tired of hearing how much you love the family but wants to SEE IT in action.  The 2 of you also have big communication problems.  You need to learn how to head off problems before they happen by being thoughtful towards one another, constantly trying to show each other how much the other is loved.  Marriage is WORK - relationships are work.  The r'ship will be a direct reflection of how much work & time you put into it.  If you're not putting much effort into truly being a wonderful husband & father, then that's going to show.  <br>  <br>  The best example I can come up with is that of a car - cars need routine maintenance to stay running as best they can.  They need oil changes, they need maintenance check ups, new tires every now & then, etc.  Now, a car WILL run if you don't do all that but it won't run as good or as long as if you had taken the TIME & EFFORT to do the maintenance.  Relationships are the same.  If each person puts in some routine maintenance, the r'ship will run smoothly.  Routine maintenance would be bringing home flowers for no reason, offering to do the laundry once in a while, helping w/ the kids one Saturday so she can go to the spa for a massage - and on her part, it would be giving you a massage when you're stressed, or offering to take the kids out of the house for a couple hours so you can study in peace, picking you up a small trinket or toy just for the heck of it to say I love you.  These are all little things that go a long way to "maintaining" a great r'ship. <br>  <br>  Goodluck to you.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	key: communication<br>  <br>  nothing gets heard in arguments.<br>  <br>  what made u fall in love w her in th 1st place?<br>  <br>  did u really wanna b w her or were u in it only 4th kids?<br>  <br>  u didnt mention th negatives of ur part in all this<br>  <br>  takes2 to tango, as we say in jamaica<br>  <br>  u need 2take sm time off 2resolve ur issues together.there r always deeper issues behind ppl's action.<br>  <br>  she may just b tryin 2gt through 2u that she needs u&is trying not 2buckle under th pressure of kids and needs ur support despite how 'fine and independent' she may come accross 2be.<br>  <br>  she's preg? also alotta crazy hormones involved.<br>  <br>  need 2be extra sensetive so putting something aside 4her during this time is really good.atleast 4now during this time.<br>  <br>  u need to find out what she's genuinely feeling.<br>  <br>  this wont be found out in a moments of anger or fustration, nor pressure.<br>  <br>  u want her?<br>  <br>  if yes, you'll get through this, if i knew somethin from ur women may hav bn able 2say a lil more.<br>  <br>  hope i helped a lil<br>  <br>  luck|`|5KCpvwb7aa	I absolutely do not think you should jump into a divorce. With being married for such a short time and having children and one on the way I think you need to try to work it out. I think you need to sit down and rationally tell her how you are feeling and tell her how much it hurts you when she says things like that. You may need to give up one of your "extra" things that you participate to meet her half way. It sounds as if you all have alot on your plate. I would look into some counseling before you think about divorce.|`|AA11518532	“neither of us work right now”<br>  <br>  How do you manage? She’s probably stressed about money… also, if it really means a lot to her for you to spend time with her instead of playing cards with your brother, why don’t you spend the time with her?  - Marriage is not easy and it seems like she’s screaming for attention, you should try to work it out, at least for the sake of the children.  What’s more important to you, your wife or your games?|`|AnfGA5uHaa	WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  noww, i ain't married yet but you need to sit your wife down and talk. you let her walk all over you. talk to her! it seems like the communication lines are open but nobody is using them. i don't understand how you can be married 7 months and be on your 3rd child. were you divorced before this current wife? how long did you date? you should date for more than a year to make sure you learn more about your spouse before entering marriage. otherwise the spouse will be on the good behavior and you won't learn anything  and if and when you get married you are marrying a complete stranger who you know hardly anything about. spend time with your kids. do something special for your wife. then maybe she'll trust you more and stop accusing you.|`|f6qGBDPMaa	She needs to smoke weed. She sounds inconsiderate, controlling and somewhat ignorant. Weed will make her a much nicer person to be around, much nicer. She'll also feel happy so she won't keep blacking out on you about things that aren't serious. If you get her high and discuss your issues she will most likely be less resiliant to drawing your needs and wants into consideration. Even if it doesn't completely solve your problem, it will make a big difference and really bring you 2 closer together and make her more pleasant.
cu67LPb0aa	Maybe you're doing it in your sleep and are just unaware of it. That's my only suggestion.|`|tVrnhFGdaa	Well of course they don't believe you, you keep saying you don't know where it came from. They probably think you're in denial.

TlnTKyXxaa	In my opinion...It might sound selfish to some, but you could try talking about yourself sometimes. What you did at work, stories, what you and your friends get up to on nights out. Even something you saw on the telly, or something that's pissed you off.<br>  <br>  Of course with this direction comes moderation. You don't want everything to be about you, but conversation is about give and take.|`|j4rirb8laa	What about holidays. <br>  What would she do on a island (with you).<br>  What would be her dream Holiday.<br>  <br>  How about if she could plan her life out what would she do.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	ANYTHING BUT MICHAEL JACKSON!

She's going to sing "At Last," with piano accompaniment. But that's kinda old. Maybe Colby Collete "Bubbly", or The Way I Am by Ingrid Michaelson. What a great song. It's from the album Girls and Boys. I highly recommend it!|`|AleWgjvPaa	I'll be there - The Parlotones<br>  <br>  It's a fairly new song by a South African band, that isn't really known outside of South Africa (and I think the UK).

Hope you find one.|`|YSnyZeRYaa	My man and I have chosen 1,2,3,4 by the Plain White T's - its a little bit different sound, but we have been huge fans since seeing them at Calgary Stampede, and ours is a rock meets classical theme anyway.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	well the question you asked is what song I would want at MY wedding and it is the song that reminds me of my boyfriend, AT LAST by Etta James.|`|h836dd9qaa	Fiance and I are using Happy Together by The Turtles<br>  He sang it to me the first time he told me "I Love You" It's always been our song|`|GrXAdJxSaa	we are using "in my life" by the beatles<br>  i also like this magic moment and <br>  everything i do i do for you|`|MG1IVmvIaa	Cinderalla by Steven Curtis Chapman|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Everyday by Rascal Flatts|`|LQsD8nHBaa	"Always" by Atlantic Starr<br>  <br>  or "I Cross my Heart" by George Strait
p9X6fX3naa	They Connected because of the husbands heart. They fell in love because of the time they spent together. <br>  Or<br>  The woman is just hanging on to the only thing left living of her husband .<br>  No I won't be the relationship|`|AA10743159	This is a great story for a movie, and guess what, it was and is.<br>  I can't recall the name of the movie, but it was touching. <br>  Lets look at it in a different way, she meets the guy who has her late husbands heart. He turns out to be lets say a creep or happily married, with children etc. Then nothing would happen. She wouldn't love that man.<br>  So it's not her late husband's heart, that she fell for, but the man.<br>  After all the Heart, is just an organ, a pump. if you will. She loved the Man, or his soul, she loved who he was, and what he did for her. Not some pump in his body.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Hmm... good question. I think she was in love with the fact that this man has a connection with her husband in someway.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	i think she fell for the person a heart is just a heart it has no emotions it the mind that controls all your emotions if yah get me i dont know how to explain it =\|`|EyaqiWPwaa	she was in love with the person she made the sandwiches for....which must be both of them|`|SimAO1IUaa	both!|`|1c36da4f8612f894c613bcc5e73b5977aa	I think her heart was in the right place (no pun intended), but her head was a little misguided. It's actually a little creepy if you think about it...I mean, I know the heart is symbolic of love and all that, but it really is just an organ at the end of the day. It's not like the guy got her husband's brain. <br>  <br>  But if in the end, she really fell in love with the guy and they have a meaningful relationship beyond the fact that he has her old husband's heart, then more power to her. And i would hope that it worked out.|`|833ch563aa	I think she fell in love because the Jonas Brothers sent her a secret message, sent by pigeon, letting her know they are dominating her life. And that aliens in the form of pickles are coming and the only way to save herself was to live on the west side of town with the heart man! And her life was saved!!!|`|5KCpvwb7aa	It sounds that maybe that is what initially attracted her to him. She probably felt some sort of connection to her husband by being with this man. They could very well be in love for all the right reasons. To me, it doesn't sound like it is a very healthy situation and maybe she was still grieving or still is.|`|SIRmkzEBaa	I think she fell for the guy knowing that he had her husbands heart, <br>  but after a bit...she probably fell in love with the actual person, <br>  not her husbands heart.<br>  <br>  =)|`|rJ3eRddfaa	sounds like both to me, but i am no expert.|`|kwgheTHEaa	The guy. Right? Because it says "they both fell in love" after one year, and if she fell in love with her husband's heart, it wouldn't take one year.|`|2vgbJhlRaa	umm he was rebound? haha the heart is just an organ, no emotional feelings associated with it. the heart only gets personified because we give it that attachment.|`|ZRk15H9Caa	Thats the movie 21 grams...Got ya

But I am a meanie.<br>  This is only bad if HE likes his tan. Because then he will go after the same look again. Maybe his friends will diss it for you.<br>  But it's always good to be honest with your boyfriend...it's a good base for any relationship.<br>  Good luck :)|`|PxcEAoBMaa	Tell him the truth, but gently.<br>  <br>  If he is a humorous guy, make a joke, like "How's the carrot bath goin' ?" I make bad jokes.<br>  <br>  If he freaks out, ask him if he wants you to lie to him all the time.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	No be truthful

And I would probably be the first to make a move. That's just the way I am.<br>  <br>  If I didn't like a guy, I would just simply tell him.  I would be nice about it of course, but I'm not the type that will lead a guy on.  Honesty is the best policy in my book.|`|OugZL6mUaa	if he told me that he liked me and i liked him, i would act in a way that told him i liked him or i would just tell him. <br>  <br>  and if i didn't, id stay away from him until he got the picture and then i add act the same way again. or the easier thing would be just to tell him you don't like him and just keep acting normal|`|F08qx2hgaa	Well, I'm quite a shy girl. I would certainly make an effort to be around him if I liked him, but I can't make any promises.<br>  <br>  If I didn't like him, I wouldn't make extra efforts to be around him more than I could help it, but  wouldn't avoid him or anything if he's my friend.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	If I liked him back I would be able to finally leave my guard down and I would be so relieved!!!<br>  <br>  If I didn't I wouldn't change much. Most girls have a built in way of handling when a male friend likes them. Far easier to deal with than a guy who you hardly know.|`|ZPhF4imHaa	This actually happened to me not so long ago... and the thing is, when your friends with someone beforehand, and they tell you this, it was almost like I couldn't help but like him....

If he finds a really lame way by just telling me up front then that would be another story (or what's worse telling me and then running away telling his friends about his failed conquest) <br>  <br>  If I really did like him back I'd expect him to do more romantic things showing me that he likes me and I'd go along with it. Most girls like to be treated like a princess. I'd act the same way around him but act more like I'm dating him. <br>  <br>  If I didn't like him...then we'd still be friends it shouldn't change that. Id' still talk to him and chill with him as long as he doesn't act weird about it or bring up what happened. Just put that behind us and act like nothing happened.<br>  <br>  Find a cute way to tell her, that way she'll tell all her girlfriends about it and how adorable it was. And if all goes wrong one of the girls that heard about what happened can be your backup girl who was extremely impressed by what you did. <br>  <br>  Though you have to keep in mind all girls are different. We all handle things differently.|`|wp3vYFB9aa	i would still be around .. your just talking about liking that person, not dating or anything yet.. true friends stay together till the end, plus most people end up feeling really close to their friend b/c u spend so much time together. if u feel its what u need to tell, then go for it.|`|FDZXMNrtaa	if i liked him back id hang with him and do my best to further our friendship n blah blah blah<br>  <br>  if not...id avoid him|`|4IhXjUpFaa	If i liked him i would be close to him listen to him and sometimes just look at him and when he would turn i turn away<br>  <br>  if i didn't like him id keep my distance|`|rCEhXjqKaa	if i liked him i'd snogg the face off him...lol<br>  <br>  if i didnt i'd let him down gently...

But even if she did do it on purpose maybe she is sorry for hurting you. For whatever reason you didn't want either of you to get pregnant is beyond me. Personally I would just really miss my twin sister after a year and would do anything to to talk to her again. Forget whatever feud you two had life is too short to hold grudges. I mean would you really wand a year to turn to many years? If so im sad for you.<br>  <br>  let go, just let go|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	You surely must know that your sister is willing to open up the lines of communication, otherwise she would not have returned your call so quickly. Being twins you also know how much she misses that special connection only twins can have. Why not buy a Special gift for the baby and a little something for "mom", then call your sister and make a date to meet / visit. This is YOUR twin sister and you can bet she misses you as much as you miss her and I am betting she will forgive and forget if only you swallow your pride and guilt and make that next move. You NEED to be in her life and the Baby's, do not waste another day, and NEVER let anything come between the two of you again. Life is much too short to lose someone as important as your sister, she cannot be replaced.|`|ph8IcueRaa	Why were you getting sterilised?  Also, she was 27?  Why were you mand?

Lots of sisters aren't too happy when their sister gets pregnant. Grow up and get over it.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	your sister is just that your sister, so what she got pg instead of steralized.

VSVQHKwKaa	Yeah great advice.<br>  <br>  Now you're ACTIVELY looking for other men to feed your need for intimacy for your husband....the very first step every potential cheater makes (whether they follow through or not).<br>  <br>  In truth, the advice you received was outstandingly bad. You're now celebrating this "win" (what exactly have you won?) and planning to separate from your husband tonight for your victory dance.<br>  <br>  How is this going to help your marriage?<br>  <br>  He broke the silence. And did it with consideration.<br>  <br>  Your reaction? Got smug! Terrific....<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your goal here is...but marital happiness it is not. <br>  <br>  Your advice was wrong. Your reaction was wrong. Your marriage is worse. And you're on the inside tract to infidelity.<br>  <br>  But you "won" the argument. So I suppose it evens out.<br>  <br>  Right?|`|AlCfnJKYaa	Sounds like you have turned the tables. Don't get stuck in the sulk for too long though. Small hiccups in marriages can grow into big problems quite quickly, and I'm assuming you don't want that.

By then it was too late to undo everything and I really wished I hadn't done it in the first place. Doing it a couple of times is ok but if he starts to respond in a different way than usual, even if its seemingly better, then stop because otherwise he'll be on his way out the door.|`|QSX4p4xPaa	This sounds a little immature to me.

You aren't loving your husband (and he probably isn't loving you like he should be!), but are thinking only of your needs and desires.<br>  <br>  Watch the movie "Fireproof" together. It made a huge difference in my own marriage.<br>  <br>  Love is putting someone else's needs ahead of your own. A lot of times we approach relationships with a "what can I get out of it" attitude which will always destroy the relationship. Real love doesn't depend on how the loved person is treating you. Love keeps on loving even when the other person doesn't deserve it.<br>  <br>  That's not to say that you're not hurting and that the road will be easy. No one every said marriage would be easy.<br>  <br>  You made vows before God and everybody, so don't take that lightly. Instead of looking at the greener grass out there, start watering and tending your own lawn so that it starts growing greener and lusher. I'd tell your husband the same thing if he asked, but somebody has to break the cycle of selfishness, and now that you have some encouragement, go do something to show love for your husband when he least expects it.<br>  <br>  Make him his favorite dinner. Look through old pictures and remember how much you used to be in love. Think about the promises you made to each other. You can have it back, but it will take commitment and work.<br>  <br>  Walking out and getting a new man will only lead you to the same spot again and again, until you're an old many-times-divorced woman. All men are flawed. Learn to live with the ones of the man you love, and stay committed.|`|j4rirb8laa	Yea, not talking sent my mad. <br>  Next is to stop doing things for him. make him do his own washing, sandwich's etc.<br>  <br>  Tell you something making up well, good nights were had. :)|`|AA10460376	BOY oh BOY!...You two are acting like PRE-SCHOOLERS!....What is going on here?...I guess next he will be taking your crayola's and you taking his pencils.....You two better start acting like adults because MARRIAGE IS NOT A JOKE SISTER!.....I wish you well.....
shH0uc43aa	First let me say sorry, no woman should go through that. Your husband is just not interested in you anymore and you should really think about getting out of the relationship. I never think separation is the answer but in your case he is just not interested in you anymore,sorry. Counseling could help but that's to say you could get him there. The question you should be asking your self is if you want to continue going through life like this. There's no other feeling in the world like love and and he's stop giving it to you. I don't know what I would do If I got rejected like that, Ive been with my wife since I was 14. And we still make love at least every other day, and kiss each other every morning and night. You know the old saying "you dont know what you got until it gone" maybe thats what it will take. And if he stays gone then your better off. Its going to be a rough road but the way he's been treating you should make it a smoother ride.|`|OZmn1n5qaa	it may be that his testosterone is low, no joke.<br>  <br>  Women actually think their guy is cheating on them or doesn't find them attractive anymore when it's really a chemical imbalance.<br>  <br>  I am only 27 but I noticed a huge slow down in my sex drive and such a year ago. <br>  <br>  I started hitting the gym 6-7 times a week and got into body building (I suggest this as weightlifting will increase a mens testosterone more than just running).<br>  <br>  Have him get checked out by a doc.|`|89UOqaVNaa	This is very, very, very difficult and I imagine, beyond painful for you.<br>  <br>  You made a commitment to love even through hard times, so let him know that you are there for him, that you love him and are committed. You are much more likely to win him over by continuing to be kind and loving toward him than by being hostile, mean, cold, or threatening him.<br>  <br>  Love him the best you can, and then bring it up and ask that you go to counselling together, but try to make it sound like you both want to work on your problems together as a team, although you might be tempted to put all the blame on him. Maybe he is to blame, but it can be hurtful to a man's self-image if he can't perform sexually.<br>  <br>  This is a serious problem. If he won't go to counselling with you together, try going to counselling alone to get help dealing with this problem.|`|D1NhxI2iaa	well I would be pretty mad ...I would be asking him some questions to why he wasn't doing these things...( I wouldnt know what to do if my husband had sex with me once every 3 or 4 months) ..I feel so bad 4 u ...|`|LuDu27z2aa	Lets but him with my wife and me and you can get together and satisfy each others needs.....email me..:)|`|2vhXqnJzaa	Erm have you actually talked about it?|`|4X1G55N4aa	talk to him tell him how you feel and tell if he wont change then you r gonna cheat on him!! simple|`|tEy9hvebaa	he may have low testosterone... that would cause low sex drive.|`|nmC7qgtZaa	id feel pretty **** horny and pissed off, cheat on him|`|lgxE5nUoaa	It wouldn't bother me - I'm not an affectionate person and I don't need sex for my life to be worthwhile - I actually prefer to go without it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's not common, but there are men with very low sex drive. My husband is one of them. He can go for a year and not even notice that he hasn't had sex.<br>  <br>  P.S. Suggest for him to get his testosterone levels checked.|`|AA10460376	It is amazing that so many people are in "LOVELESS" relationships. I walk away from a relationship after 15 years because there was no romantic love and every relationship needs this kind of intimacy to survive because sooner or later, one of you will look for this intimacy with another person....Then the cheating will start....You need to buy as many DVD'S on, " how to be intimate with your partner"as you can possibly find so that your husband can see how he has been depriving you all this time.........I will start here and if this doesn't work, try therapy..., A SEX THERAPIST" who can help you two find the intimacy that is obviously gone from the relationship...I wish you well.....|`|9KIICFdIaa	Sounds like there is no love left in this relationship. He wants sex when he gets horney, which isn't very often. Kissing is nothing more than showing you that he loves you. I would have a real hard time in a relationship like that as i am a very affectionate person. Women have dumped me because i'm too affection for them.|`|j4rirb8laa	Have you tried to talk to him on why he feels this way.<br>  Tell him you are not happy.<br>  The next step could be counselling|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I'd leave knowing he didn't love me.|`|05SbMDA6aa	Sounds like a normal relationship with somebody who has a low sex drive. I continue to date my boyfriend after 3 years who has a especially low sex drive and has never liked kissing & we're still very much in love.  He is not the type to cheat (he prefers routine and is quite straight down the line!).  I don't know what the answer is except to try things that will improve his labido though talking about these issues can be a very sensitive matter!|`|IiEyh0ADaa	No, every 3-4 months is NOT normal at all. If my hubby and I don't have sex at least 1-2 nights a week I get withdrawls and freak out. So, maybe he's getting it from someplace else. You should ask him or do some searching, find clues. Google the signs of cheating and you will probably be surprised at how many of the clues show up. Weather or not he's cheating, you should sit down and talk with him about this. That is the only real way you will know for sure what's going on with him. I've heard that when men reach 40, they need to get their prostate checked every year. A lack of sexual desire at 40 could mean other health risks like his prostate. Approach him carringly and if he gets hostile or defensive then he's probably going behind your back, i'm sorry. I also know from experience that if you've gained weight over the course of your marriage, men tend to be less attracted to us, it's really stupid cuz we love them with their chubby bellies, hairy a$$es, and snoring, right? lol.

bLpNuvPiaa	Maybe she needs a friend that isn't her husband. It's okay for people to have friends outside of their marriages - in fact, it's healthy. The key to a relationship that stays together is people who have both interests together and separate. <br>  <br>  If you feel like she's spending too much time with you and not enough with him or you feel uncomfortable, try suggesting a group outing with more people and include her husband.|`|AA11518532	"they are a young couple"<br>  <br>  so are you much, much older?|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Maybe your name has something to do with it.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	She probably wants to spend time with you because your her friend and she wants to get away from her husband for a couple of hours.<br>  Sometimes when you live with some one and you spend every day with them it gets tiring.

If she did, she would see what this is doing to you.  If she did, she would WANT you to find happiness & love with someone else knowing she can't be with you.  That is real love.  What she is doing is stringing you along for her own selfish whims.  Talking to you makes HER feel good and lets her escape her own marriage.  Is this REALLY the kind of woman you want to invest your time & energy in?  I wouldn't!  For one, I would have no respect for her for the sheer fact that's the kind of person who CHEATS on her husband and goes behind his back on things.  I wouldn't even want to be FRIENDS with a spineless, coward of a person like that in the first place, let alone fancy her!  You need to cut off all communication with this woman period - just be done - like pulling off a bandage.  Since she came into your life, have you ever been able to move on in a meaningful way with anyone else?  You're sitting in the stands while life is being played down on the field!!!  You've put yourself out of the game for someone who doesn't even put your own needs before hers.  <br>  <br>  Goodluck pal.  If you stay waiting around for someone  like that, then in my mind, you get everything you deserve because YOU have a choice.  She's not forcing you to chat with her.  Hell, she's not even on the same continent!|`|AA12216204	She is married, stay away.|`|jY9HdMwtaa	WOW, that's a mess...<br>  i feel bad for you..  and it really hurts to tell you, that you guys would never be together UNLESS she's planning to divorce or something like that...<br>  i don't think you should talk to her anymore.. <br>  it's better if you forget her as soon as possible.. i understand that u wont be able to forget her... in days.. it may take years.. but eventually u'll get over her..<br>  if u keep talkin to her .. it's gonna get worse.. <br>  <br>  and if you want everything to be over.. i think the best thing.. would be to ask her straight up..<br>  if she has any feelings for u.. if she's not happy with her husband.. and tell her you love her...<br>  <br>  just get it over with ... atleast you would know that you tried..<br>  i know its hard.. but nothing is impossible...<br>  take care..<br>  and i hope you feel better|`|r9soQ5inaa	I talk to a male friend (who I once had a relationship with) online since i am on another continent also.  I talk to him not because I am unhappy with my husband or because i still have feelings for him.  I talk to him because he is a friend I can get a male point of view from.  If he ever told me he had feelings for me still I would cut off contact.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Sounds like OCD maybe? You need to talk to a professional about this. I think it's a good thing you're on different Continents.<br>  <br>  BTW, my nephew got into the same thing. The husband lost it when he found out and shot and killed them both. Like the Godfather said in the movie, never come between a man and a woman.|`|j5k0VRbPaa	ok the worst thing you  could do is  try to interfre  i mean come dont you watch scary movies when the guy steals the girl and the  guy ends up being killed  trust dont do it
AA11530601	No way should you chicken out. You havent done anything wrong so dont be scared. You did the right thing by signing up- she sounds really pushy and rude and she shouldnt get to steal all the shifts. If she can sign up so can you,  whats to be worried about? same rules for everyone. She cant stop you. <br>  It dosent have 2b a fight at all!! just dont let her cramp ur style ;]|`|9fc6963cbdae594803724cff5fd4fb54aa	Don't be intimidated by someone just because they do things like this. She is probably insecure with herself and you should make sure that you stick up for yourself. Make sure you go to that thing you signed up for and show her that she can't control you or boss you around anymore. You've got to let her know that what she does annoys you, because she might not even know that she's really bothering you.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	You shouldnt pretend to do anything. Tell her the next time she snatches something out of your hand, and disrespects you, you'll smack the hell out of her.|`|MHMndoCcaa	Na...if she knows yur intimidated...she will just get worse with yu...and if yu can't fight...than girl...go ahead and take yu sum boxing classes!<br>  Cuz i know if sum dumb girl snatched a pen from my hand.....uh uh!!!|`|km8oM3YHaa	Don't let anyone treat you like crap. Next time she cross the line smack the Sh** out of her
jzdDF3Ljaa	if she's your BFF you should be able to put this behind you and STFU.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	-_- -_- and -_- this is absolutely positively the dumbest question i have ever seen. it is not worth my time ..... DIP SHERLOCK DIP!!!!!!!!!|`|9fc6963cbdae594803724cff5fd4fb54aa	I think you're just overreacting. When friends bother friends or when they get into fights, sometimes you need an outsider's opinion - like what you're doing now. It was actually kind of good of Amy to ask questions on here about your friendship because she'll probably find some good answers on how she can act in the friendship. Just don't make a big deal out of little things like these because they will eventually cause some big problems. If Amy is someone you want to keep as a friend, don't make a big deal out of something little like this.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	No. Think about it. She was obviously overreacting herself by posting the question. she must truly value her friendship with you, or she wouldnt be worried about it. Talk to her. apoligize.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	if she seems upset n the two of you are friends, thn talk it out. but she has the right to ask wut ever question she want about wutevr she wants|`|AA10960571	Kinda but as your best friend she should have come to you and let you explain what you meant by your comment.  Then she would have known that you were only kidding with her.  It sounds like she really took offense to what you said.  As far as her writing questions about you you have a right to confront her about that and tell her how that made you feel.  Maybe if it goes well just kinda apologize for the comment and let her know you were only kidding and didn't mean anything by it and you should get an apology too for the questions.  She overreacted and I think she will realize that once you guys talk it out.|`|AH2U33enaa	Talk to her about it. Clear the air. Around you two, you sound like good friends! It would be bad for that to end over something silly!|`|wp3vYFB9aa	i dont think ur wrong.. b/c its your opinion about questions they ask, not about what they believe.. though i am not religious so maybe that could affend her? i would talk to her about it too.. tell her u didnt mean it that way and u were just joking.. this is something u would need to reach closure on!<br>  hope that helps
7gH7sgi6aa	This one is easy.  Actually you just need to step back, take a deep breath and the answer is very clear.<br>  There was never a problem with your Son using the laptop before when he ASKED permission to use it, which is fair, because the laptop does not belong to him plain and simple.<br>  Your StepSon is more than willing to allow you Son to use the laptop as long as he asks and that truly should not be a problem.<br>  The whole business about how much the Mother spends on the Step kids doesn't even play into this issue....this is a respect issue.<br>  Your Son simply should have respected his StepBrothers laptop and waited and asked permission.  There is no in between or how much money is spent by the Step Mother involved in this matter, it is simply one of respect of one's property and asking permission to use it.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|03GQ637Raa	I am sorry to say that your step son and your hubby ex are right.  When something is downloaded on a computer it takes up what is called memory.   The more stuff that is one the memory card, the slower the computer will perform.  Your son should have asked if he could download the IPOD  software before doing it.  Also, when you download you really have to know that there are no viruses, malware, adware or spyware in the software that is being downloaded.  <br>  As for buying Christmas or Birthday presents try going on EBay, Craig's list and other online wholesale sites.  Check the classified section of your local newspaper.  Also check out estate sales, I always make a killing doing that.  Be frugal.  One thing you won't have to worry about is that your boys won't be spoiled and by struggling now will help them be more productive and successful adults.
LZqHQTZpaa	She is not, because in my book prettier means more natural, hot on the other hand is different, that means that someone just exudes sexiness plainly the sex on legs.<br>  She could be this except she is not sexy enough because of the tan and the eyebrows freak me out a little bit, but not saying she is ugly I would turn around if I saw her down the street.<br>  Also I tend to find that those that put on fake tan tend to be as flat as an ironing board.<br>  <br>  He must have a better reason to dump you for someone like that, who seems to be slightly self loving maybe other things bothered him because looks is not the only reason why I would dump someone. Also even though people that know me personally say i'm the nice guy I might dump someone if I get bored of where the relationship is (I simply want to move on to new things, in his case the orange industry)<br>   or her personality is more appealing though she doesn't appear to have as much personality as you do.<br>  <br>  erhm.. now the bad points about you, you also wear too much make up so that's bad because you don't look as fresh as you could but you are not too bad, could be worse but you are cuter than her. I couldn;t assess personally who is hotter as body shots would be needed(but don't worry you seem to be ok so no need for more pics, btw you look better in the second one in my opinion) as I think hot is the whole body shape and face for me.<br>  <br>  I think it depends what you appreciate more looks or personality.<br>  me personaly I would be affected more if I was dumped by someone better looking, but I think that would soon pass just as looks pass, he might change his idea of what is attractive. If I was dumped by someone uglier I would assume there was something wrong with who I am and the way i do things so  icould change my bad habits.<br>  but "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" so you might think she is better looking but he might think he rather downgrade than be with the cute girl from ....... class that hed umped because....... but hopes he still has a chance.<br>  <br>  But I think you just shouldn't worry and move on, maybe someday he'll realise it was a mistake or maybe it wasn;t meant to be.<br>  A friend of mine ruined peoples relations because she thought her boyfriend dumped her for "her" and I think she once used "hoe", therefore that's a path you shouldn't follow. maybe someone you've never noticed likes you and you don't realise that.|`|KzDwZfLBaa	For me, you're hotter than her, though you wear make up, you look more natural than her, you are definitely sexier!!|`|e62f95518e0bb700635945c8033d6bceaa	I don't suppose that it occurred to you that looks may not even a factor?<br>  <br>    You are attractive but looks only go so far...maybe he fell for her because she is warm hearted and fun to be around.<br>  <br>    I have a niece that is drop dead beautiful but she can only keep a guy for a short time because she has a toxic personality.<br>  <br>    The point that I'm making is that why he dumped you most likely isn't because of how you look but an attractive personality trait of the other girl.|`|AA10928214	Find a cuter boyfriend. you're prettier, she looks way fake|`|YnhFDvDxaa	well you are prettier but the fact that she puts a topless picture of her on facebook says to your bf that its more sex for him|`|mJo35PwXaa	ur both hot id say u prob just win but u both put on **** loads of make up|`|NxBYuOzbaa	Oh, she's a hoe alright, what kind of self-respecting girl puts pictures of herself in a bathing suit online like that?! <br>  <br>  And I, presonally think your prettier than her, especially your eyes, kinda made me jealous. <br>  <br>  The question about the uglier/prettier, you got me there. IDK. So if you find out, let me know...<br>  <br>  Anyways, you're beautiful, so stop dwelling on the ex, and move on.|`|aTphEpJtaa	she looks good in her bathing suit and i didn't see u in one. get a picof your self in an bra or bathing suit and i will debate from there between u 2|`|UvkF2pZraa	your prettier but shes not ugly<br>  its his loss if he left you<br>  you can find a better guy than that|`|4Xv5NRsWaa	yo wtf?<br>  <br>  youre so much prettier. just ignore that douche of a boyfriend and get a guy thats a billion times hotter than him. serves him right|`|kvlnADyIaa	No, I personally don't know why he broke up with you. I know one reason it may be.<br>  <br>  Sex. <br>  <br>  He might just want sex. You're probably the kind of girl that wants a romantic guy. When she's the kind of girl that wants a big hard one. Just my thought. Your way prettier than her. Hands down.|`|4XyDgV0haa	Um..

Their looks and their personality.  If they don't have one, they damn well better have the other.   And it is the truely rare person that has both.<br>  <br>  Well, its pretty obvious he didn't dump you because of your looks,... your both fairly cute (a bit young for my taste,  but cute).<br>  <br>  and since you refer to her as a "hoe", I'm going to say I think I know why your boyfriend ,  oh   excuse me,   your EX-boyfriend, dumped you.<br>  <br>  Must be something about your personality that was rubbing him the wrong way.<br>  <br>  ....maybe?|`|fFnfFROQaa	I wouldn't worry so much about vanity and pride here to judge who is more hotter or not.<br>  Move on, your BF already did...never mind the past.<br>  <br>  You are only hurting yourself if you are going to be worrying or thinking or pondering about her and him....<br>  <br>  Move on.<br>  <br>  By the way, that navel decor she got makes it looks like her navel  vomited something shiny...too weird.|`|AA11349925	You're very insecure and really quite orange.|`|ISnJu0W3aa	wow shes pretty fake. that tan is hideous!! haha. its pretty obvious hes just thinking with his d!ck. you are genuinely pretty but she is soo barbie, its easy to see why guys think of her as attractive. because she looks easy. <br>  <br>  its probably less embarassing to be dumped for someone like her coz everyone can see that your ex is just shallow.|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	You = Pretty<br>  <br>  Ho = Skanky|`|itiLu3dRaa	Ya'll are both as orange as a carrot, he mus liks de coulour orangatang.|`|YPV02h36aa	AHAHAHAH. ive been laughing for the past few minutes, omg she looks SO FAKE with that tan! her armpits are like 349725827 different shades from her orange color.

I think you both for the most part look alike...hard to tell as your pictures are nice and clear and her's are cell phone pics. though, she looks like she had some implants put on, but it may be the photos... And I'd say you win out a little bit, but again, it's hard to really say.. I'd say that the reason he dumped you is probably not your looks... more likely it's just that he wants to get around... put another blonde chick on the count...<br>  <br>  I'd say that your better off without the dude... I mean, personally, I'd also say lay off the make-up a bit... but that's just me...<br>  <br>  Either way, your probably better off...|`|258mrT2Paa	my thoughts are lucky boy, both very pretty girls.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	She looks like an ompa lumpa.

You will find a guy who will love you and won't leave you because he got free Willy Wonka candy.|`|W0XoDxJraa	You radiate natural beauty and that is more than can be said for her. Your second photo in particular is just stunning. I also love your make-up.<br>  The other girl looks trashy and she obviously has to flash her body to get attention because she lacks what really matters as a person/<br>  <br>  Move on, he doens't know what he's missing. I'm sure loads of guys, more respectful guys, would give their right arm to be with you!<br>  <br>  You're lovely, far prettier than her. :)|`|hlJ1AXBDaa	wow ur both hot but u are way hotter<br>  <br>  cos her fake tan is way too much<br>  <br>  <br>  xx|`|06O8FaOjaa	EWW SHE WEARS WAYYYY TO MUCH MAKEUP YUR WAY PRETTIER AND PLUS YU CAN TELL HER TAN IS FAKE AS HELL|`|MHMndoCcaa	Yu are sooo PRETTY!!!!!!!<br>  That hoe looks like damn robot<br>  <br>  And...my ex boyfriend left me for an uglier girl...and im hotter...so much...and he likes her personality better..and he likes my looks better..so i guess she automattically wins....so who cares...yur prety|`|z3QsWmzpaa	you are both really pretty but your stunnin and she got well too much fake tan on her armpit is like completey white compared to the rest of her body dont worry about his new girlfriend being hotter than your gonna get someone millions times hotter than him =]|`|cu67LPb0aa	Well you both are very attractive, but her tan is way too much to bare.

OXtYMoVLaa	Okay first off I have to say that people, who say it’s just flirting, brush it off, are stupid. Okay how does everyone start to get interested in one another before they go out? They flirt! Instead of flirting with that girl he could have taken the time to flirt with you and text you things on your phone like maybe, why don’t you come see me at work, I miss you, blah, blah, blah. This is maybe just me but I think people should be done flirting with other people if they are happy with what they have. Even if he was just doing it for an ego boost, it’s still an assholish thing to do. I think you should go to him and act like you heard from a coworker of his that he was flirting with another girl and if he denies it, dump the jerk. I hope this helped.|`|OlTuytNVaa	If he is going to act like a prick when you can see him, imagine what he is doing when you can't see him. Dump him.|`|ydAoReD5aa	Um i would let him know you saw.

Q6Dyu1zKaa	I married my wife because she was the one I fell in love with.  To be honest I think she notices her aging more than I do (she's in her early forties and I am a few years older than she is). <br>  <br>  As for women in their early twenties, nope I'm not really interested thanks.  Aside from the fact that it would be like dating one of my oldest daughters friends, I also don't think women look their best until they have fully matured.  Probably explains why I dated women older than I was when I was in my twenties.<br>  <br>  Besides, if I was to go hook up with some twenty year old girl, who's to say my wife wouldn't hook up with some 20 year old guy.  And since 20 goes into 40 more often that 40+ goes into 20 ... well you don't have to be a math whiz to see who would be getting the better of that deal (especially after the inevitable divorce).<br>  <br>  So no, I would say that real men don't do this.

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	ok, first of all, i have to get it off my chest that the whole wishing well nonsense is just tacky.  you never come out and ask for cash, and that is all the damn wishing well looks like.  given the currant economy, AND the fact that most of the people at the reception already gave a shower gift, its just rude to ask for anything more.<br>  <br>  <br>  that aside, if you MUST give something....seeing as though they are putting you on the spot by having this wishing well, only give what you can.  seriously hun, dont put yourself out because you want to look better in their eyes.   im sure other guests who know about the wishing well thingy are just as upset as you are buy it and by having to dig around for money you really dont have.  so give what you can afford to, and not a penny more|`|76nTvO4iaa	$25-50.|`|AA10722993	Just because they are having a wishing well, doesn't mean you have to give money!    You can give a gift instead.  I would find a nice picture frame, or photograph album.   You won't need to spend more than about $20.    If you are short on cash, that is enough to spend.  At any rate, what ever you do, only give what you can afford.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	It depends on a lot of things, like how well you know the couple, if you're bringing a date, and where the wedding is taking place.

I refuse to reward such appalling behaviour.|`|RC6Dn6zoaa	Honey child give what you HAVE, nobody is well off financially at this time, anything will be greatly appreciated and if they are good people they will be understanding and not call you out for not taking out a loan to top everyone else's "gift of Love".

She thinks its a bargain even though she paid a bit more when she got them amended as it was a little bit too big for her. <br>  <br>  There are loads of shops that are currently have a sale on at the moment so why dont you check them out and scan for some dresses. Im sure you will find one from there.. After all ￡80 is a lot of money to just waste these days.|`|2vhXqnJzaa	I wouldn't risk it myself, what if it doesn't arrive? Doesn't fit? Or is poor quality? For something as important as your wedding it isn't worth it. Why don't you try Monsoon, they used to do a bridal section around the ￡80.00 to a ￡100 mark, I nearly bought mine from there as some of them are beautiful, you could also try Debenhams too as they quite reasonable. Have a great day!|`|9Fm8j2NUaa	You can always order it and if it doesn't work out, you can re-list it on ebay. I have looked at that seller before. They have nice dresses. Send them an email and ask for a price quote for the dress you want. Include your zip code so that they can calculate the correct shipping. I am pretty sure, if it is the same seller, that it is fairly expensive once it is all calculated.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	No, but I did buy an actual designer gown Allure Bridals Style 8505 brand new on Ebay. I love it! It's new and I got it at a steal for $325. It's worth $1100 or so. I also bought other designer gowns (13, I'm strange) for around $75 from other sellers. I'm going to sell them out of my house for fun. They are new and look great as well. I have heard positive and negative feedback about dresses from China. So I just went with something I already tried on at a bridal salon then found a bargain on Ebay. It worked out great for me.|`|zSABr7praa	I dont know anyone who used that specifically, but I do have a friend who bought her dress for TWENTY FIVE US DOLLARS (VEEEERRRRYYYY CHEAP)from a seller who needed to get rid of it.  It was amazing, and she really "wore it"(wasn't afraid of getting anything on it, just had an amazing time) she wore it to the bar that night with no fear.. her sister plans on wearing it now :)|`|U3qTwOOIaa	I wouldn't risk it for your wedding as that is a special day so a special dress is required.  Also you would need fittings and maybe alterations.  If money is an issue you could hire a dress or sometimes charity shops sell them.  You could always get it professionally cleaned. Or try House of Fraser and British Home Stores.<br>  EDIT:  Just checked the website and seller has some negative feedback I would not go there if I was you!|`|Oh75DqReaa	i agree with most answers<br>  i wouldnt do it <br>  <br>  what if you gain a little pounds or lose some?<br>  :|<br>  <br>  plus shipping is 15.00<br>  i got something off ebay from china and it was only 6.00 but shipping made it almost 30.00<br>  <br>  <br>  but if you dont have money<br>  you could go to thrift stores lol<br>  i think i saw ross have some<br>  jc penny <br>  davids bridal 99.00 <br>  and june bride about 100.00<br>  <br>  i hope i helped and good luck with finding one<br>  (:|`|Rzm20vLlaa	My step-mom bought a wedding dress on eBay and didn't know that wedding dresses are sized differently than other clothes. The dress was a size 12US, but actually fits a size 8US. It was too small and she wasted all that money. She had to buy a different dress right before her wedding, and it was very stressful for her.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't risk it, unless you can get the dress wayyyy ahead of time to see if it fits, AND if they have a return policy.<br>  <br>  You want everything to be as perfect as it can be on your wedding day. Dealing with an ill fitted dress would be a nightmade for you. Weddings are stressful enough to plan without worrying about the dress fitting you properly.<br>  <br>  There are places where you can find wedding dresses at lower prices. Shop around and I bet you can find the dress of your dreams at a price you can afford.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I ordered from gianinarbridal & was totally happy with my dress.  Below is a link to pics from the ad and my actual dress when it arrived (if it doesn't work, e-mail me).<br>  <br>  Just be careful with the seller you deal with - make sure they have lots of good feedback and if possible get a recommendation to a specific seller.  Know what their return policy is or isn't.<br>  I would also highly recommend that you order as far in advance as possible.  There are sometimes delays with shipping and the dress could be damaged during shipping and you would need time to resolve any problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kodakgallery.com/ShareLanding.action?c=lgskr25.84v59gpl&x=0&y=x9gu5q&localeid=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodakgallery.com/ShareLanding...</a>
8bTder08aa	First thing:  your anger at your MIL is doing far more harm to you than it is to her.  If your MIL does have personality disorder issues, she is completely impervious to your feelings.  They simply do not matter to her.  OTOH, your anger can cause you physical problems, and serious ones.  <br>  <br>  Second thing:  anger empowers the person who is making you angry.  She is pulling your strings, making you dance to her tune.  The way to stop that isn't going to be found through anger, it's through indifference and making a conscious decision to unempower her by not caring.<br>  <br>  Counseling is a fabulous step.  As you have discovered, when you are dealing with someone who has a toxic personality, you cannot act randomly around them or in response to them, not ever.  You have to know what you are going to do, have a plan and stick to it.  If your plan depends on other people (like your husband) reacting a certain way, you need to be certain they will act the way you expect, or else not rely on them.  <br>  <br>  My dad and his sister are like your MIL, and basically I had to draw borders around my life, borders these two people are not allowed to cross.  I know what my limits are, what I can tolerate from these disfunctional personalities, and that includes defining the time I will spend with them, where I will go with them, the things I will do with them, and what behaviors are dealbreakers that will cause me to stay away from them. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you have not clearly defined your borders, either because you haven't given systematic thought to what your limits are, or because you aren't being honest with yourself about what those borders are.  Could it be that the anger you feel is your response to feeling helpless about still having to tolerate things that you find intolerable?<br>  <br>  Example:  Easter and not spending the time with her.  If your bottom line is really and truly that you'd rather take out your own appendix with a blunt knife and no anesthetic than spend Easter with your MIL, then you need to own that!  Never mind whether it's "best," or "fair," and don't let "should" or "should not" come into it.  Sit down, get serious and think about what you can and cannot stand.  Don't try to edit, don't try to judge.  Just capture what the things are that you truly feel you cannot do.<br>  <br>  Then ask if it is possible to make these things your borders.  Okay, you agreed to do holidays with MIL because of kids, husband, etc.  But if the reality is that you agreed to this and you honestly just can't face it, OWN THAT.  <br>  <br>  Knowing what your borders are, what the dealbreakers are, is the first step to unloading the anger.  Second step is addressing the realities of those borders.  If it's impossible to get the thing you want as a border, what can you get that's close to it, and how does that make you feel?  If it's impossible to avoid some holidays at MIL's, can you do things like limit the time you spend in her presence?  Can you create a "safe haven" that you can retreat to, such as parking your car a block or so away and go sit there, listening to music or reading or something, if you feel you can't stand MIL anymore?  If your husband stays right beside you every moment you're with MIL, will that help?  Can you find ways to make your MIL less toxic, such as getting her to do an activity that gets her focus off you, or having another person there who causes her to modify her behavior?<br>  <br>  Anger comes from a feeling of helplessness, and helplessness comes from feeling that we're trapped in a situation we find intolerable.  Relief comes from finding a way or ways to modify the situation so we feel more in control and less helpless.  It comes from unempowering the person who makes life hell for us.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0LlRUBWlaa	he/she who angers you conquers you<br>  i say detach emotionally|`|AjjKETIxaa	I have same feeling towards my MIL and FIL. <br>  Still I follow few rules: <br>  1. When they come to visit my home I dont insult them or pick a fight with them. <br>  2. Sometimes I buy gifts for them.|`|krQiDGCHaa	My mother in law is much like yours.<br>  <br>  Wanna know what fixed it?  My husband finally stepping up.<br>  <br>  He stepped up and told her that she needed to back off.  Period.  He flipped out on her.  It was still bad for awhile, but slowly it has gotten better.<br>  <br>  I still dislike my mother in law, however I don't hate her.  Someone on Y/A gave me some great advice once.  You don't HAVE to like her.  You don't have to be her friend.  You don't have to want to spend time with her.  You don't have to talk to her, or engage in anything with her.<br>  <br>  So, I've stopped.  I talk to her once in a blue moon, and we get together with his parents every 3-4 weeks, but it's only a few hours a month so I don't get my panties in a twist over it.  I bite my tongue, ignore her idiocy, and then try to let it all go by the time we get home.  Usually, I succeed.  My husband and I ARE a team now, so I don't have to worry about it.<br>  <br>  I know exactly how you feel, though, because we weren't always a team. There was a time when he would try to remain neutral and not support me or be the stand-up, protective husband I wanted and deserved.  Finally, he understood that if I didn't come first (not neutral, but first) that our marriage would dissolve.  To his credit, he NEVER put her first -- he would just try to remain in the middle.  Now, there is no middle -- we are a team and I love it that way.<br>  <br>  I try to stay out of stuff, though.  Trust me, it really helps to not talk to her.  I speak to my MIL on the phone maybe once every couple of months.  I see her once a month maybe for 2-3 hours at a time.  I really prefer it this way, because I do not like her company at ALL.  Now that I'm not seeing or hearing from her much, there is really no way for her to interfere in my life as much, so I don't think about her as much.<br>  <br>  I used to obsess like you did -- literally EVERY DAY would get sooooo angry and annoyed, and much to my regret some of that would be taken out on my husband because I'd be so angry that he never fixed it, etc.. it was a big vicious circle.<br>  <br>  We had a long, long talk one night where he assured me from here on out we would be a team.  We set a bunch of "rules" in place and wrote them down.  I stopped feeling guilty for disliking her, and distanced myself.  It still took awhile for the anger to dissolve, however after a few months of time went by and nothing really happened (because we distanced ourselves and I hardly see or speak to her, so it really makes it hard for anything TO happen) I slowly started to feel better.  <br>  <br>  Now, at this point, I really don't get angry with her at all unless new stuff comes up; but it doesn't come up very often because like I said, I don't see or speak to her often.  My husband is still on my team, and everything is going great.<br>  <br>  I suggest talking to your husband and putting "rules" in place.  Make sure you're in agreement about how to handle her and situations -- I totally agree with your therapist there.  Then, try to relax.  Remember the following things:<br>  <br>  1.  YOU are giving her the power to ruin your life.  Why?  She can't make you THAT angry unless you let her.  Stop.<br>  <br>  2.  In the grand scheme of things, why does any of this matter that much?  What is important is you, your husband, and your children.  THAT is your family.  She is extended family.  Focus on your immediate family.<br>  <br>  3.  As long as your husband learns to back you up and be 100% on your team, then nothing she can say or do should EVER impact your relationship with your husband.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Please e-mail me if you EVER need to vent or chat about it.  Trust me, I've been there, and I really wish someone was there for me to vent or chat, or ask advice when I needed it. :)|`|MXGFGBtZaa	I think you need some 'me' time.<br>  Getaway for a week or so. Go somewhere with friends...with your husband if you want. Go somewhere far away. Clear your head.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	I've found the only way to defeat obsession is to focus on something else. Maybe take a class, get into karate or pottery or yoga or something and have some fun. When we're enjoying ourselves it's easy to dismiss the BS of others and just laugh. She's not worth the mental energy you're spending on her. Spend that time thinking about something else.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Wow, I can truly say I have never experienced this level of rage against another human, but if I did, I would be in therapy for it and cut her out of my existence.  Let your husband go see her alone on holidays and stay away from her.<br>  <br>  One thing I suspect is that you are calling things anger that are not anger:  Hurt, pain, frustration.  I think it is important to learn how to not go to an empty well time and again expecting to find water.<br>  <br>  Learning how to manage my own behavior and let the other people own their responsibility in "toxic relationships" is still a challenge for me.  I'm sure no one masters it in life, but if we see it this way, it can help.
M5hzHHvtaa	personally i don't think you did the wrong thing.<br>  so what if its a text and not over the phone or face-to-face...i don't think it matters all that matters is that you want to end it and so you did.<br>  <br>  if i was you i wouldn't feel bad...this guy has cheated on you so many times...he doesn't respect you so why should you respect someone like that?<br>  <br>  don't pay attention to those silly little comments he makes such as your immature for ending it over a text...its his way of getting you to talk back to him...his doing it in a sly way.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	He cheated on you and you're worried about his feelings? Just move on and forget about him...let him play games with someone else.

But i mean it is also her parents fault for not caring...and she is only 13....hopefully she grows out of it...she just loves attention|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Now you can see why your parents say the things they do about staying out of trouble. You sound like your in good shape and that's the best thing you can offer her. By that I mean setting a good example.

She doesn't have anyone who understands her and care about her. So I guess the best thing to do would be to get along with her and make her feel that there's is always a friend who actually cares about her. Gradually you can make her understand that she's going on a wrong path and warn her about the consequences.<br>  In short, you have to build trust in her as a friend and then direct her to the correct path :)|`|kwgheTHEaa	Your friend seems like she's in trouble. Ask her what's bothering her and what happened to make her this way. If she refuses, try to be a supporting friend, but don't try to take control of her life and making her stop at whatever she's doing.<br>  <br>  Is it family trouble she's having? Or maybe she's heartbroken? <br>  <br>  Try to be the understanding friend and help her through her stage. Although sex and drugs is a little too... well... too mature for a 13 year old... I'm kind of sad for that. However, I hope you can help her!
b7vQjp9vaa	erm well i know i'm not a guy, but i know where you're coming from. That happened to me with my best mate and i often talk to my guy friends about this kind of stuff. They used to kick my *** alot and you should take it as a sign he likes cause he's taking notice of it and obviously feels comfortable doing that sort of things to you.<br>      With the hugging thing, he probly feels close to you and likes to touh you, but not always in a sexual kind of way. If you get what i mean. It's a good sign if you feel that way too about him but if you don't like it, talk to him about it. Remember, you don't have to let people do things you dnt want. <br>  <br>  you obvioiusly like him alot and he obviously gets on well with you. With what you've said and my experiences he definatly sounds in to you and if you want to take it further it sounds like a good idea. Since he is your best mate, i'd advise you to not rush into things as if it turns messy, you dnt want it to ruin your (what seems to be) awsome friendship!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you xx :)|`|XaFyv4TLaa	i do the same thing, so yes he wants more but doesnt think that you do so he holds back form saying anything to you. he's been waiting for you, ask him and you will be pleased.|`|yN5YQ8REaa	Based on what you said it sounds like he does, he gives you what u want and everyone knows that guys always "kick ur butt" when they like you.

Then give them a picture frame (the one that says #1 Grandparents or Great-Granparents) and instead of a picture, put the lab test results in it or if you have a sonogram pic, put it there!<br>  <br>  Or place a "coming soon" legend in the frame!|`|AA11813187	Send them a greeting card for becoming a great grand father.They will be happy to receive the card and it will make their moment a memorable.|`|nyCW1Xt5aa	Well what I would do is get a picture frame that says 1# Grandparents and put a ultra sound pic in it .

And congratulations on waiting it out till you found the right guy :)  <br>  <br>  Ok, so the first time can bother you less if he spends some time making you feel more comfortable, and get you more 'excited'.

Just take your time and let it evolve slowly.. you'll be fine.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	You can't be serious, your getting married and the first time you ask about sex is here in a open forum where you most likely get answered by a 14 year old.

1Bto3sZeaa	Well, what are your 'expectations' for the one(s) you meet?  That's a good question to ask yourself.  Also, if you are lonely, what things have you considered (or have you done) doing to alleviate your loneliness?  Btw, I am like this as well, same predicament.  I'm 33 (male) and was in a 10 year relationship with a like-aged woman.  We broke up around 1 year ago, and I haven't dated since... also, I have no friends given a few reasons, like them moving hundreds of miles away to be with their wives families... lame.  <br>  <br>  Anyhow you can check out my question here on Y! answers almost exactly like yours... <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajjp.Y_vQfM33Oi0rwsJ5xXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225221754AATE3X2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  And no, that isn't too much to ask... honestly, being that I'm in the same boat, I'd like the same.

It's tough there though, most girls/women have mp3 players on at all times.  <br>  <br>  You'll find someone, as will I... maybe.  lol  Someday.

Lots of times guys will run around in circles and waste time on pointless things. Then 5 years later, they still haven’t improved as much as they should have.<br>  <br>  In this article I clear the dust off this issue and give you a clear, concise method for getting good with women as quickly as possible without wasting time doing pointless things.<br>  <br>  Warning: The steps below take work. It is not easy. This journey will probably be one of the most difficult things you’ll ever do. It’s also one of the most rewarding things. Having an abundance of beautiful women in your life is pretty awesome. It can take a LONG time, and lots of hard work, but you know what? It’s worth it!<br>  <br>  If you want to get SCARY good with women, as quickly as possible, there are 3 main things that you have to focus on: Attitude/Mindset, Lifestyle, and Approaches<br>  <br>  Attitude/Mindset<br>  No matter how far along you are in terms of your success with women (or in any endeavor in life), you should always keep your “student mindset”. Just because I’ve been actively working on myself for 2 years doesn’t mean anything. I’m no better or worse than anyone else. I’m still a student of the game and still learning every day. ALWAYS BE LEARNING. Try out new stuff. If you feel that you are “above” something or someone then you’re on the wrong track. You can be more experienced, but you’re still a student, and you’re always learning and getting better. This attitude is deadly and will help you improve much faster than the chumps who feel like they “already made it”. Stay hungry, you’ll see the difference.<br>  <br>  Approaches<br>  You’ve got to approach women that you don’t know and talk to them. Start with “Hey I’m Sean (insert your name)” and smile. Soon you’ll learn how to hold conversations, then how to get physical, then how to tease, then how to go on dates, then how to get laid. Eventually you will be getting laid very very consistently. It’ll freak you out how easy this process is once you get it.<br>  <br>  What you should do: Go out 3 or more times a week and meet women. Some guys can handle going out 7 times, some can’t. Figure out what works for you. You’re best bet would be going to night clubs and bars because there you’ll find lots of women to practice on. If you blow it with one girl, you can turn around and talk to another one right away. If you’re not old enough to go to clubs and bars or if you just can’t do it, you have to find somewhere else with a lot of women. You can try malls or bookstores. Go out 4x a week and approach 10 girls each time. Make a custom plan to fit your schedule. The more women you talk to the faster you’ll improve, which brings me to my next point…<br>  <br>  Lifestyle<br>  Women should be part of your life. Get more girls who are friends. You’ll approach girls, get their numbers. If it doesn’t work out, keep in touch with them anyway. After a couple months you should have way more girls in your phone than guys.<br>  <br>  Note: At one point I had to make an excel spread sheet because I forgot which girl was which. This is common, you’ll get it too.<br>  <br>  If you have a sister, hang out with her. Surround yourself with as many women as possible. Old, young, fat, slim, funny lookin’, hot, etc… The point is to get you comfortable with the feminine energy. Women will begin to feel more safe and relaxed around you simply from the vibe that you project.<br>  <br>  If you: are always learning, doing your approaches consistently, and hanging out with lots of girls everyday, your results with women (and self confidence in general) will skyrocket. In a month, you’ll see a major improvement, in a year you won’t even recognize yourself.<br>  <br>  Take the plunge, you’ll be glad you did.|`|kkM8vFfKaa	It's not too much to ask. I don't have a whole lot of friends but I do have a boyfriend who is actually my best friend.<br>  Before I got a boyfriend I always hung out with a circle of close friends.<br>  You should try making friends before you get a girlfriend. It will help you with your social skills a lot.<br>  Just talk to people. I know it's hard, but it takes time and effort to make friends. Talk to people you sit near in your classes at school. Eventually you'll start to hang out with those people (if they are interesting), and you guys will become friends. Once you have friends its a lot easier to get a girlfriend. Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S. Your looks don't mean a thing. Not to me, anyhow. It depends on the person. EVERYONE has got to be attractive in some way. And getting a "rocking body" will not make you get every girl in the world. Some people like chubby boys, like me. Just have a nice personality and treat girls with respect. Don't expect them to come to you just for your looks, because not every girl is like that, we're deeper than that.|`|gPeEdjmuaa	Of course it is not too much to ask. It's always nice to have friends and someone of the opposite gender to hang out with. You have to start the conversation and the friends, they aren't going to come to you.|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	It's possible to feel lonely even if you DO have friends and a significant other.

Im really trying thoe. what im doing is just trying to get involved with clubs as much as i can and going to different functions. i meet new ppl everyday..so just get ureself out there and dont be shy. just be ureself around new girls too.  after tlking every now and then..then maybe ask if she wants to see a movie sumtime or play some wii haha or have a couple ppl over to hang out...i have the wii fit which always helps start conversations and you have a good time.  good luck:)|`|F08qx2hgaa	You could try joining a club or group of people that have similar interests as you, or try taking up a fun hobby.<br>  <br>  Say hi to people you know when you see them. <br>  <br>  __________<br>  <br>  It is not too much to ask.

I live in GA so I'm not sure about Florida laws of course, but the IRS is universal.

On time, every time? <br>  <br>  And if you two are legally divorced then the stipulations have been completed ironed out and stated clearly for the both of you. I would review any information pertaining to the terms of which you both agreed upon during your divorce proceeding. You will need all the paperwork and information you can get.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, you can not be taken to court if the child has a legally primary parent who is paying for the majority of the child's needs and support.

Develop a committed, lifelong relationship.  <br>  <br>  If you do that, I guarantee the sex will be very satisfying, for many years to come.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	don't do it unless you want to get slapped and then she'll tell all of her  friends and they'll all think you're anasshole. you'll be single for a while.|`|D4e9jv0iaa	you tell her "Hey you wanna have some fun in the bed"<br>  <br>  idk im 13|`|258mrT2Paa	I think she's feeling me<br>  well if you "think" she is, there is no point in going to bed.|`|7xnMr6zVaa	that best way is by talking to her and have tell u what u want say if she want to hang out some where private with u and she say yes take to room|`|35c3df911f84beff6b1fc6dff3df6190aa	tell her ur great at cuddling|`|7z9eKO2maa	start off by talking to her, then kiss her... see if she kisses back eagerly, if she does, go in for more, and then see how far she'll let you go... if she lets you finger her that chances are she'll let you have sex with her, do that and if she doesn't stop you then look at her for a second, and tilt your head towards the bedroom in a silent question... then you get your answer, then go for it|`|1c36da4f8612f894c613bcc5e73b5977aa	if you wanna be like that, then i'm sure you'll figure it out. there are plenty of girls who will sleep with anyone without knowing them. i don't know what the appeal of having sex with a random person is, but hey, i don't judge. personally, i would rather know the person and care about them so it would actually be good sex. but that's just me.|`|047ecf329d7469d9e5d25143df2534fcaa	if this is what she is feeling. you want have to tell her anything. she will go in somewhere with you her self.|`|arXdjAhmaa	best thing is to ask.<br>  <br>  i'm a grl n i like to  hear it straight forward|`|DcrI9zmkaa	If you aren't able to talk about it, you shouldn't be doing it.|`|8bP67U8Taa	lmao.. just ask her.. by what I hear girls are nowadays, you probably won't hear a no. lol|`|k7YMROOBaa	say i gotta show you something in the bedroom ;)|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	watch porn with her|`|Z7eQZVqjaa	Well, i personally think you should try to get to know her first.  IF you are tryignt o get her to have sex with you, its not a matter if she wants to or not its a matter how comfortable she is with youat the given time. Don't be too sexually overbearing, meaning don't hit on her constantly or use cheesy pick up lines. be causal and confident. women loves confidence. give off the vibe that you could sexually please her in ever imaginable way, but never say it.   there is this book caled the game that is all about trying to pick up on chicks, its rather informative. i think you shoujd,l check it out. but remember understand what women want and be casual and confident.|`|Um9jbMPgaa	Easy there tiger, she needs to be in the mood before you get to the bedroom. The bedroom will not get her in the mood, it'll just freak her out if this is the first time.<br>  <br>  My advice, go for a walk, make yourselves alone then see what inhibitions are dropped. <br>  <br>  Make sure first and second bases are covered and from there work out whether 3rd base is within sight. If it is, why go to the bedroom, go au naturelle!|`|2SbJAwkZaa	ermmm tbh if your at a party and you thhink she is feeling you .. then it would just come across and happen u dont reli ask out right do ya ..! <br>  but on the other hand hang with her ... chillax ... and if ya reli think she wont attack you for a dam right ansa then just hint " so ya wanna continue this upstairs " ....<br>  <br>  BUT PERSONALLY IF A GUY JUST THREW IT OUT LIKE YOU WANNA HAVE SEX I'D LIKE YOU KNOW BE LIKE " WHAT THE HELL "  if its gonna happen n go that way it will ... you have to know the vibes are right .. and she truely want it .. like rubbing up against ya and maybe hinting and feelin ... you know ..<br>  but dude best way is hang chill have a date continue dating n then the sex will jst come ... u cant just look 4 a score ... <br>  <br>  but hey lesbian here ... so yeah lol ....|`|hS2grKvRaa	Roofies.<br>  She cant say no..|`|f0YzgIoQaa	Go with the flow, if thats where she wants it to go thats where it will. Otherwise she might just feel your pushing her into it|`|luEk5dh3aa	Umm stop being such a man *****? Girls don't like when guys just try to get into their pants. Maybe, I dunno, get into a relationship before planning a trip upstairs, eh?|`|DbM2OeSNaa	Say "I lost my teddy bear, will you sleep with me?"<br>  <br>  or try "I don't know much about pies but dang you make my banana cream."<br>  <br>  Those usually work for me.
TkPJYlaMaa	I need 5 or more seconds. And I don't feel weak, maybe a bit a light-headed or freaked out|`|l3b0hjdWaa	if it's with the right person|`|mgdkr6hvaa	well if it's a person i don't know, i might get a little nervous. It would make me notice them. I might think about them then and think about if they are thinking about me now, lol.  <br>  2, 3 seconds isn't that long though. <br>  If i saw a guy and we both happened to lock eyes at the same time, i would lock eyes, idk if it really stirs emotions.  Maybe a little,<br>  make me emotionally weak, not really. IDK<br>  Why are you asking this may i ask???<br>  and what's it like for a guy?|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Yes, I feel an electric jolt and get the urge to quickly look away. It's a rather uncomfortable feeling, though later I get all warm inside.<br>  <br>  Kinda creepy if you ask me, which you did.|`|I5SypMlsaa	love to do the staring games :)|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	If they are hot... of course!|`|JG7Dlnm3aa	for me that is really romantic! not like the cheesey kind, but the real kind, ya'know? honestly, i would most likely turn away from someone's gaze, so you need to have a compelling gaze. you gotta make me want to stare at you. if i didn't like the guy i would break eye contact, but if i did, i'd probably get this deer-in-the-headlights look, and my stomache flutters! even if you don't like the guy though, it's kinda flattering, and i've been known to fall in love with flatterful (flattering? idk how to say it...) guys.... it makes you more interesting!<br>  awesome question! good luck w/ your lady across the room!<br>  ?s ya!|`|LKsl00CTaa	Yea, happens all the time. I'm currently flirting, making eyes and smiling with a girl I hardly know. All I know is her name, and the fact that she's in English when i'm in Physics on a Thursday = ].  It all started with a glance, and now I wanna ask her out tomorrow. I'm either insane or stupid, but i'll take the risk for her.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	she wants to make you a sandwich my man....just ask her to make a sandwich and then you can eat it and shell be way romantically involved with you|`|wnBkuzpzaa	i wouldn't maintain eyecontact for that long if I didn't like him. and i would totally get that little electricity feeling through me, and daydream about him for the rest of the day =D|`|DU92j3H0aa	sometimes it can|`|le0LsiVUaa	all the time...its more like banter though :P|`|arXdjAhmaa	yes very much|`|k7YMROOBaa	ooh|`|AA10783888	OMG yes, <br>      There is this guy at church and I really never would have noticed him but he did one of those catch your eye things, and wow did that make me think. Now I look for him every service and think about him a lot. And he has done this look more than once.<br>      That type of 3 second look means, 'I am interested in you', and wow if you could be me when it happens what a feeling just to know someone might be interested for once. :)<br>      So FYI, guys if you aren't interested don't lock eyes with women, it will send the wrong message. It goes the same way with women too.|`|vRZolfOraa	I would say yeh.<br>  <br>  There is this guy that I like and when I see him around and he looks at me and I look at him and we both smile I get this weird feeling. A fluttering in the pit of my stomach that just makes me smile and leaves me on a natural high for the rest of the day!<br>  <br>  Would I lock eyes with someone I didn't like? No. This would make me uncomfortable as I would hate to give them the wrong impression by holding their gaze.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	its a feeling undescribable its like you share a moment that noone can interfer with even though you have no emotional connection with them being human you start feeling the warmth of there eyes looking at you thinking that person can see your true thoughts of them and you start to get nervous and try to find an escape ......   weird huh it happens|`|QxQxVPnraa	Well it depends if the person is attractive to you<br>  <br>  If i like him then yes, and i shoot a quick smile and get all happy like omg i saw a hot guy and we locked eyes<br>  <br>  I would lock eyes with someone i dont like emotionally but I dont have the need to, and no emotions are stirring.|`|YpU8TYtSaa	I would NOT lock eyes with anyone that I didn't like romantically unless I was talking to them. It always feels good when you lock eyes with a guy you think is cute or you are interested in. It's a great way to flirt!|`|FDZXMNrtaa	i get a shock i guess u could say...in my stomach<br>  <br>  it makes me weirded out or happy...depending on who it is|`|DbkC5Op3aa	if it is some total stranger no... but if it is someone i had known, possible yes.|`|xNvbtRJBaa	a yeah every time i look at this boy i like i feel like im in heaven!!
aDIPIu7xaa	It means my contact fell out and I am afraid if I move, I might step on it.|`|K6JSNQJQaa	Well Mr. RRR....when I lock eyes with a man it's because I find something intriguing and sometimes exciting.  Sometimes it's a sparkle in the eye or just simple smile.  You do know that the eyes are the window to your soul.  So, there has to be something there to see.  Attraction to the opposite sex can be explosive....even from that first glance!|`|0mbv4AHJaa	If I were to lock eyes it's at 2 seconds at MOST...and that's if i'm interested. If not, I look away instantly.<br>  I don't get weak, I get curious....to see if the guy will DO anything about it. <br>  <br>  <br>  and men..if a women locks eyes and smiles...or you catch her looking at you a lot..she thinks you're attractive...approach her...don't wait 2 months to gain the guts to do anything. Makes you look like a wimp.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	yeppy it happens to me. theres a connection there and ya both know it. it doesnt mean you have to act on it. theres is just some chemistry there.|`|2bhMmlzHaa	Sometimes and then i look below to see if he's packing <br>  no bulge not interested unless very very rich.|`|qDl5Gegbaa	yup i always lock eyes if I'm interested at least 3-5 sec probably...I don't count but I know I do it on purpose if I'm interested in what i see...
FZKFLTyLaa	What you've not broached here is if you have considered asking YOUR parents to split the "loan" with HIS parents, so as to allow for an equitable agreement among both families.<br>  If your parents are capable of rendering an equal share this conflict is readily avoided.<br>  If they are not capable, your fiance's parents should be quite capable of understanding and not purposefully causing turmoil for all parties concerned!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	If both your parents are offering to contribute, then great and accept graciously.<br>  <br>  However, seeing that it looks like there are strings attached to this one I would say politely decline and do it on your own.  You can save up the money and not have to deal with snide comments.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Don't take out ANY loans for your wedding! You don't want to start out in debt. Your best bet is to save up the money yourselves. :) Good luck!|`|zSABr7praa	The tradition of parents paying is because traditionally, people got married young, with little or no funds of their own.  It was their parents way of setting them up on their own.  If you've been together for 20 years, I think you two waive that tradition.  DO NOT TAKE OUT A LOAN!  Have a small wedding!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I am in the SAME EXACT position!!  How we handled it, whenever the subject is brought up, my fiancee and I simply say "We're not telling you who is contributing and how much anyone is contributing... You have to worry about yourself."  Because, it's none of their business!!<br>  <br>  My parents are divorced, and don't have much $$ floating around...  I'm not saying my in laws are rich, but they are better off with money... But, they still except my parents to pay up...  So we keep our lips sealed...  Sometimes the FMIL gets a little feisty, but she always does :)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Your parents aren't under any obligation to pay for anything. Figure out what you can reasonably spend without going into debt or taking out any loans and plan your wedding using that amount of money. Don't have an expensive wedding if you can't afford it obviously. If cake and coffee is all you can afford, then that is what you have. Make sure that you are 100% happy with your decision so you don't become one of the countless brides who comes back here and says she wants a do-over wedding because it didn't turn out like she wanted the first time around.|`|4POGapREaa	Aren't weddings fun?  LOL!  Turn down the offer from his parents entirely.  And WTF is that anyway?  A loan?  How is that contributing to where they have the right to disrespect your parents?  Screw that.  Tell them thanks but no thanks.  I wouldn't invite that element into my planning.  It's just going to stress you out & spoil the whole experience.  I planned my entire wedding & ditched the whole thing at the last minute because it all got overwhelming & seemed unnecessary.  We ended up just getting married by ourselves on the beach & I don't regret that at all.  <br>  <br>  My only thought aside from that, is that you shouldn't have to take out a loan of any kind to pay for this.  Why?  I mean I know you've been together a long time & maybe this is something you want to be extra special, but it's ONE day & there is no reason to make monthly payments for the next who knows how many years for this.  I'd rather make payments on a new car or a plasma TV that I was still enjoying daily.  We had our wedding & honeymoon all in one in Maui.  I had a beautiful dress, I had my groom, a gorgeous Sunset, a photographer to capture it all, and we didn't get into debt over it.  Do what's within your means at this time.  If that means a dress for you & a courthouse wedding, then do it.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Definitely do not borrow money from in-laws or parents.Eliminate the potential time bomb.Besides,if you do it yourself with your money. Or money borrowed from the bank. It will be much more meaningful for both of you.Best of luck to both of you!|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	I think if parents decided to help financially, it's great and lucky for the couple, but not required. <br>  I'd rather decline his parent's money and pay for it myself if it was causing problems.|`|IUYpGvCXaa	Parents  should not be  expected to pay, especially if you are established (over 30).   Elope...and enjoy YOUR Day together!  You can do a wedding/honeymoon all at once & save a ton of money...plus much less stress!  You should not have to make anyone else happy...nor have one family talking poorly about the other.  Tell both families "this is how it is going to be" and if they don't like it or can't get over it, then go with the elopement.|`|R7b150Iyaa	If you've been together for 20 years, you must be AT LEAST 35, if not older. Can't you pay for the wedding on your own?  I think at that age, parental contribution is out the window as you have been independent for so long.  Don't take a bank loan, you NEVER want to start off married life in debt.  Either downscale your plans (have a small but beautiful destination wedding + honeymoon in one, for example) or save up until you can afford it.  What's another year compared to the 20 you have been waiting?|`|b69f867cd0e8c768ad08a228c35f9b04aa	You have a giant bright red flag staring you in the face with the attitude of your future in-laws. Don't borrow their money, don't take any kind of financial contribution from them. It's not worth it to deal with any kind of "war" between the families.<br>  <br>  My own desire and motivation for planning my wedding is completely shot as a result of parents claiming a right to demand aspects of it because of their financial contribution and an inter-family war breaking out. The worst is that I'm dealing with a passive-aggressive war. It's awful. I just want to be married... all the family politics completely shot the joy in wedding planning. Don't do that to yourself, especially with the red flags I see in what you wrote.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	It is traditionally said that the brides parents pay for the wedding but we are in the 2000's now and not every parent has money to pay for a wedding specially one that would cost a butt load of money. Your parents are just trying to survive it doesn't mean their bad people because they do not offer but maybe they do not have anything to offer. I think it is nice of your in laws to offer you the money if you feel secure doing this than go for it but you have to make them realize that at this time your parents cannot do this. It is about you and what you guys want and if taking money from his parents is going to start a war because yours have not offered than go out on your own and do the wedding yourself. I myself think that taking a loan out for a wedding is a bit much and after your lovely day who wants to worry about the bill that will haunt you till its paid off. You guys can figure it out. Me and my fiance are paying for our whole wedding ourselves. My parents have bought a little bit of stuff but not a lot and I didn't ask them to and his family didn't offer at all. So we waited till it was possible. It is tax time so is using money from that possible? I wish you luck.|`|sLLgERQWaa	No loans and no borrowing, Toots...you two have been 'room-mates' for 20 years? Well then, elope to a place you can afford for a Honeymoon and it no longer becomes an issue of 'mean' parents but two people who have been together for so long they just decided to make it 'legal' without all the muss & fuss after all, you aren't a blushing young virgin, you are a beautiful mature woman so the pretty princess bridal dress and all the fluff you should have outgrown for more mature things, IMO......wear something sexy, go someplace exotic /romantic and have fun....good luck.|`|3lxagSP7aa	go with the bank, I dont think your in laws have any right to assume your parents will fork out for a start they might not be able to. pay for your own wedding because his mum sounds like you will never hear the end of her generousity if you do, say thank you but you would rather pay yourselves and have a commitment by your hubbie to be that he will say the same.Tell his mum you are greatful but have money set aside, whether you have a loan or not is none of their business,|`|FyGo3A5Naa	You have already stated you don't expect your parents to pay and that is perfectly acceptable. If your future in laws have a problem with that - it is their problem not yours. However, they may think by contributing to your wedding fund they can have a say in what happens -- that should not be the case. Too many people get involved in the affairs of others and hijack an event which is not theirs to plan. It is YOUR wedding - so you get to decide what YOU want!|`|e06b9510d36d6807614f5b27b3db416faa	This is what you do..<br>  You discuss how you feel with your partner..<br>  come to an agreement on the basics..<br>  then envite both sets of parents to dinner..<br>  then during dinner..<br>  you tell them very politly that you want to pay for the wedding yourself as it is what you both want..<br>  and it is NOT up for discussion!<br>  <br>  This is the ONLY big day you will ever have, it is YOUR day, you make all the shots, you pay and you have the most happy day of your life.<br>  <br>  Dont let anyone spoil it. My friend let her parents help out big time with funds, then after they had paid for loads of stuff they insisted that they help decide until it roller coasted into her mum being the main organizer. it wasno longer her wedding, it was her mums, so to speak.<br>  <br>  Alternitly, go abroad and have a wedding already planed for you in a beutiful location, just the two of you. Mention that to the inlaws, see if they want to interfear then.<br>  <br>  Do what makes you feel happy and have a wonderful day.

IcH5gMICaa	One day, you'll wish he said it more often.  For right now, just drop it and don't argue back.  Just say thank you, and so are you.|`|sCr2iTczaa	Keep arguing.....|`|xZOHlSXsaa	Do you truly feel like he IS amazing? If so, tell him :) <br>  <br>  It's like the "I love you", "yes, but I love you more" thing - don't stop it unless you want to.<br>  <br>  Argue back, but only a. if you really feel that way and b. for a short time, don't let it stretch out over more than 3 or 4 counters.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|AA11635143	Just say, "Thank you, that is such a sweet compliment; you sure know how to make me feel good."  Then just let it go; don't keep batting the compliment back and forth like a tennis ball.  Watch for reason to give him surprise compliments; he'll appreciate them.|`|06O8FaOjaa	WOW PATHETIC JUS LET IT GO|`|gqvvXknQaa	I think I'm gonna be sick...|`|28ux28S0aa	First, I think that you are too young to be bogged down with a boyfriend at your age. Live a little more first. Find out who you are and let him find out who he is before steady dating. I know that it seems like a small thing to have a steady boyfriend at your age, but from experience, the choices that you make now will effect your future and your character.<br>  But, if you stay with him- make sure that what you tell him is from your heart and not just what he wants to hear or what you think should be said to a boyfriend.  Sometimes in relationships we feel pressured (whether from ourselves, tv influence, social politeness) to say things( like, I love you)  which may end up hurting someone in the end, or causing those words to lose their powerful meaning because you were not being totally truthful.|`|kvlnADyIaa	Ha, good stuff. Anyway, for example if he says "You're beautiful." you could reply with "Aw, thanks your so sweet." or Aw, "You're so sweet." All of this works. When he says you're amazing ask him how. That might help broaden the statement. Depends, I personally never let things go like that. Just tell him he's sweet, nice, and that you love him and it'll be good.|`|eybHcHz9aa	Say "thank you". It's lovely that he wants to tell you! <br>  Then say, "I think you are too" because that is nice!<br>  If he starts on the big loop...say "Darling, please, save it for special moments eh?"<br>  <br>  I know how it feels, it's slightly less special, and feels a bit less true if he says it ALL the time. When my partner tells me I look good, or smell nice, it's usually out of the blue!|`|kbkbDhwLaa	I'd let it go. I loathe that. Next time he says you are amazing, tell him thank you. That should stop it right there. Going back and forth like that is ridiculous.|`|4IHe4rPYaa	say "no you are baby" one more time after that and stop or be like "i know" and giggle and he'll think its cute.|`|SimAO1IUaa	i hate when that happens and it drags on and i think it gets akward. after he says your more amazing just smile at him! let it go|`|a1b7c4cf11e20d9d9f24ac54972174dbaa	Just smile and let it go|`|aMGfRum0aa	That's a good question! I'd say let it go, just smile. :)|`|ajLIpmeEaa	Well, you should not be like wow, thanks alot dude! You shouldnt make it sound like you didnt want the compliment. You should reply like no, your amazing, and then he would reply, no your amazing, then you just smile, and like 1 or 2 minutes later you should be like no your amazing. If he argues to that, then you should just smile and not say anything. Then the next day, you should tell him that he looks really cute or something like that. It will get him going. UR WELC!|`|F3hdhAGYaa	you CAN let it go..u r supposed to let it go|`|11828c71068f8d346742bd68e2456376aa	yea i say keep arguing its a cute little thing between couples to argue about things like that. :D|`|jY9HdMwtaa	Continue arguing for a while.. then let it go..<br>  because basically.. he's just flirtin wit u...
AA10065812	???<br>  No, she gave up any right on child support the moment she signed the Welfare papers.  Now's it you against them.<br>  <br>  You need to account for all the time you spend with the child as it affects what you pay.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Obviously she needs a income and assistance if she is applying for welfare, yes, they would go after you for child support..court ordered through family court..settle everything legally in court..visitation rights..custody..and any other issues regarding the child. If she really need an income..child support isn't an income for her to live on..there lies the problem with your agreement with child support..|`|QSX4p4xPaa	I'm sure you can, but with any legal situations like this, you guys should get it in writing and the both of you sign the agreement, that way, if she wants to take your daughter from you, you can take her to court. It's not legally binding, but it would show a judge that you both agreed to something.|`|0LlRUBWlaa	in Az any money you give your exspouse is considered a gift-if it is not ordered through the court. i suggest anything you do is on paper specifying exactly what it is for- and notarized by both of you|`|MG1IVmvIaa	Take care of your daughter by being a man and support her, quit letting the government take care of your problems....
NeTNnvSZaa	Oh yes, contempt means you pissed off the judge.  Not a good thing.  Some people spend years on contempt charges.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Yes, I used to put dead-beat parents in jail for non-payment of child support daily.  He will probably be there until he pays what the Judge said he had to pay.<br>  <br>  There is a sentence imposed, probably.  So, he can either pay or do the sentence.  Sorry.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	When one ignors the directive of the court, one can go to jail, that is the consequence of not following a court order. Your ex will eventually be brought before the judge again and all he has to do is agree to follow the court order and he will be released.|`|4uike3ARaa	Depends on what he has been found in contempt of. Some journalists have stayed in jail for months rather than reveal their sources.

DcrI9zmkaa	Yeah, I'd say someone is trying to split you up...and I'd say it's working.<br>  <br>  The issue here is trust.  If you truly trust each other, it won't matter what lies or gossip others are spreading. The fact he thought you might be cheating shows he doesn't trust you.  Without trust, there really is no relationship.|`|AA11635143	He is an insecure liar and is trying to make you feel guilty about everything you do.

He shouldn't ave gotten mad at you about the phone call but it is understandable to doubt because its just natural. I would just talk to him about his call and tell him its not true and let him know that you would never do that to him, and I would tell him that you got a call to. That way he could maybe see that it is just someone trying to ruin your relationship.|`|n6sMy0Ndaa	if he didn't love you then when this person told him that you were cheating on him he would have finished you.

7hRZMmwSaa	Tell your friend it's not that you don't want to spend the night with her, but your youth group is having an event and it's to make money for the hungry in Africa. Tell her that you really do want to go with her, but this is something that means a lot to people, and still even though she probably won't be able to come with you still ask her if she wants to come, there's a chance she could be allowed and it will let her know that you're not completely trying to avoid her out and ask her if maybe there's another time she can spend the night at your house|`|oNkxVdSjaa	tell her u'll sleepover next week..y? is she soft or summat??|`|tTIANoryaa	Just tell her that you have a meeting to go to, im sure she'll understand, you can maybe do it next Friday.|`|iYyzY9sUaa	you can always chill wit a friend you cant always turn 1 dollar into 5!!!!

4Q4dZJHpaa	If you like him that much i suppose you could go with whatever one you like.,but to be honest i hate it when girls dump a guy for his friend.i know sometimes it happens but if hes a proper mate he wouldnt go with his friends ex girl.it can ruin a friendship.sometimes not,but if ur close mates with someone you owe them some loyalty.its bad enuf to be dumped but thats just pouring salt on the wounds!theres plenty more fish in the sea,why does it have to be his mate?maybe im totally wrong n every situation is different but it just annoys me when girls do that!if you do decide on the other guy at least give it a little time after you finish with the first one|`|nctI8wmBaa	hahah i'm in 8th grade too! (:<br>  wellll. i think you should be with someone who you click more withh, you know what i mean? haha. i think you and sean will be a better match than you and brian. and...it's not horrible. but i think a lot of people will be talking about it/rumors going around schoool.<br>  <br>  follow your heart! haha, good luck <3|`|lIx6kngbaa	stay with brian|`|msGQPrrjaa	Do what you think best.Somebody's gonna be hurting|`|DozD8lTGaa	you're breaking up with him to get with his best friend! harsh!<br>  <br>  i knew a girl who was with a boy for 2-3 years (i know you have only been with your man for 3weeks but, here's an example) anyway she ended the 3 year relationship and got with her boy friends best friend... all he wanted was sex!<br>  <br>  he got what he wanted from her and ended it... then she went running back to her 3year long boy friend. so never risk it. it also split the boys up and they ended up not talking.<br>  <br>  the boy is stupid if he is willing to break up with his best friend JUST for a girl!! he will soon realize though! <br>  <br>  if you aren't happy in the relationship, that is a fair enough reason... but, wait a bit until you get with his friend... ok????<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope i helped... x|`|uzthUP9Faa	wow thats a sticky situation uve got urself in ...... put it this way,, if i was brian, and u dumped me for a close mate,, i would proberly hit the other guy, and would most definitley fall out with him.. Its like a unwritten code really,, even dating an ex GF of a close friend is frowned upon. <br>  But hey he not me, if you explain how you feel to brian he might take it well.. but he will undoublty feel like a fool. I think it will be really hard to sustain a friendship with brian if you form a relationship with this other guy.<br>  <br>  If i was u i would definitely end it with brian,, the fact that you are asking this question shows ur relationship is weak. Do what makes YOU happy ... Look after number 1. Dnt stay in a unhealty relatioship,, theres nothing worse|`|whFHzbvuaa	leave brian for sure since you have feelings for another guy... <br>  <br>  i dont suggest dating his friend because that would ruin a good friendship...<br>  <br>  but if you do decide to go out with sean, dont do it right away. wait a month or so...<br>  <br>  plus youve only been with the guy for 3 weeks so its not that big of a deal to break up with him. just tell him the truth. (about how you feel about him, not sean)|`|xgfOfJc4aa	the first thing i think you should do is break it off with brian<br>  i feel if you have any second thoughts u shouldn't be with him<br>  after that its up to you to decide if you want to go with sean<br>  but your in the 8th grade u don't have to date at all just flirt with everyone and be the super popular girl that all the guys want lol!|`|plFyCtm3aa	Honestly, it is really bad to go out with a boyfriend's best friend. Us guys really despise it. But at the same time, if you tell Brian what's on your mind, you will be much better off with Sean. And Sean and Brian will never fight each other because of you if you keep it straight with Brian.|`|hyRj4eIjaa	i think that you should break up with brian and see if you like sean. ive been in that situation before and my old guy was happy for my new guy cause he knew that he really liked me. so my advice is to ask out sean. good luck! email if u wanna and tell me how it goes|`|LAYJxqrHaa	well question number 1, try it with sean but tell brian that you still want to be friends with him. #2 i don't think it's entirely bad but give it a week before you do go out with him<br>                                         Peace.|`|WxV9P9NQaa	tell brian first about your problems and if it doesnt change move on and go with sean.<br>  <br>  and two if you do break up with him and go out with his friend i bet he would feel horrible cause their friends and all. if i were brian i would be devastated|`|DSseZwPLaa	1.) I think if you want some one who loves to talk like you date sean <br>  2.) but this im not sure about i've dated my ex bf's friend before and they still got along the same|`|YN8xDQYmaa	try talking to brian but if you dump him wate untill things cool down a but then go for it whith sean he sound realy good for you =)|`|euRNN0LBaa	dowhat you feel. if you really like brian stay with him but if you think sean is better hey go with sean. listen to your heart (:|`|qS35btkHaa	dump himmm. you dont like him that much. just wait a couple days to go out with sean so brian doesnt get too jealous.<br>  but when you break up with him be nice about it.|`|zgodnnLGaa	You should dump him but still be friends with him.|`|XkH9YWOjaa	its good that he hates it, it shows he likes u and doesnt want to lose u. it wud be soo messed  up if u went out with sean. i say u wait things out with brian.|`|wEZ7mNICaa	You don't have to match. Go with who you are more comfortable with.|`|eVPkWZU4aa	Gut feeling baby, Gut feeling...do what makes you happy!!|`|lkiHt4t0aa	Ok go out with sean. He is better for you.|`|HinSwo97aa	toughie, but i'd follow your heart.<br>  think of who you want to kiss more<br>  think of who you want to hold hands with<br>  do a pro's and con's list<br>  the other question is- will they betray each other and date you?<br>  if you do let brian down, do it easy.<br>  if you take in sean, let him know that you made a sacrifice and he betterbe committed.<br>  <br>  brian might not take you back if sean leaves you.<br>  it's up to you, good luck!|`|Z6JFpquWaa	sounds like you've made your choice already but,you want justification in  dumping brian you dont want to feel bad about it.you said your in 8th grade so no matter what the outcome wont be so bad in a few years you'll met someone you really like Brians heart will be healed twice over and sean will be a memory.brian will probally feel like his world is over(dont worry that only lasts a week)and if his friendship is strong with sean it willl mend after you and sean have had your fun and moved on.on the other hand if you really are good friends with both I wouldnt persue either relationship as any thing more than friends|`|xfQqztGRaa	In my opinion, Brian might be 1 of those quiet types that might be a bit shy  and doesn't always want to talk to others. Breaking up with Brian just to go out with Sean, would cause a big conflict, possibly ending their friendship and maybe others too. It wouldn't be right(my opinion) to break up with someone just to go out with another, unless Brian did something unforgivable. If you personally don't mind and won't be bothered breaking up with Brian to go out with Sean, then you could possibly do so.<br>  <br>  Although u hug others, Brian may be jealous is why he probably hates it. Sean may not care, but he may start to care once you two go out. You don't really know 100% for a fact that he wont change. In the other end, Sean might hug other girls, and you might get jealous. It might happen or it might not happen. <br>  <br>  1) Stay with Brian a bit longer, maybe he will do something good for you, if not, I suppose go with Sean.<br>  2)I think going out with his friend will cause drama and conflict :p|`|WvcTLuGNaa	I would agree with the listen to your heart statement.<br>  It sounds like you have already made your mind up to be with Sean.<br>  just be prepared for it. Dating your ex's friends can be dangerous but in high school it's just how things go.<br>  I would say go for Sean but be gentle on Brian. let a few weeks pass before getting official with Sean, so he doesn't automatically assume you left him for another guy. You got to do what feels right other wise your just lying to yourself.|`|00P38FKraa	Honestly, if you broke up with brian and went out with sean you truly are a ******...guys come and go friendships are forever|`|NAxNWHN3aa	yeah why do girls always have so many hearts either you like him or not if you like another person then you dont like your old one anymore. But if you do go with sean then you will look like a total slut and brian wouldn't be seans friend anymore|`|mbvpWNMeaa	The most important thing is to be honest with both Sean and Brian about how you feel.  Since you have not really shared a long or deep relationship with Brian at this point, I would not feel too badly about breaking up with him to pursue a better match, but be careful of his feelings in the process.|`|Un9CElCaaa	why do girls do stuff like this. u shouldnt have gone out with that guy in the first place if u dont like quiet guys. now u will ruin their friendship and probably in time none of u will talk to each other at all|`|LJTSpOd4aa	i think you already have your mind made. you rather have sean i can tell|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	1. maybe you should wait things out until you know whats right. but, maybe you should just break up w/ brian and continue a friendship w/ sean. then, give it some time where brian cools off and then go for sean. b/c if youve already had a friendship w/ a guy youll most likely go farther in a relationship. but, its ultimatly your choice!!<br>  2. yes, it would be horrible to go out w/ his friend. like i said bfore, give it time. then i wont be as bad.
66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Sexual frigidity.  Nagging.  Letting her mother have to much influence.  Radical mood swings.  Always siding with the kids against the father.  Shopaholic.|`|JQjl5obUaa	1. Superiority. Many women, for instance, noting that competitive men will ruin their competition through d ate r ape d rugging and arranged divorce feel or adopt an attitude reflecting a false "feeling" of being thus empowered and superior ~ because even if the husband is ruined she won't be as long as she remains "true to the bigotry of the court". <br>  <br>  They know ruination of a spouse by date r ape d rugs happens sometimes, as businessmen in this world are largely crooks and courts will do what keep them safer. So, as long as people buy d ope and thus gift mobsters with 800% profit margins those who hide that profit in legitimate business are always going to be more "competitive" and thus most surviving business men will be crooks with blood on their hands and the courts, self promotion being a function of wealth and self promotion being a prerequisite to being a judge, will be as well. Women are not stupid ~ they are merely not righteous (see the Bible where if I'm not mistaken it says: "There are no righteous women").<br>  <br>  #2. Women tend to think that men should be invulnerable. This is only attractive until something breaks, or is deliberately broken (see #1.).<br>  <br>  It is less than attractive to complain that a broken man is somehow unworthy. <br>  <br>  This is closely related to #1. You might say it is a corollary complaint.<br>  <br>  #3. Women tend to think men are "nonsupporting". Washing a dish, or making sure that a spouce is entertained in the midst of a narchotics driven cons serfative "revolution" is silly. Cons serfatives hate dish washing men. They hurt them. Women vote in cons serfatives nonetheless (we men are outvoted after all), so who's fault is it that we cannot do what you want safely?<br>  <br>  Machismo is a pre-requisite of survival, yet ... forbidden, by the very group imposing the rules by proxy, again, the unrighteous women.<br>  <br>  #4. The wifey comes first rule. See # 3 and you get a full dose of machismo reality. Men MUST BOND today ~ you voted in NARCHO TERRERISTS as the female government of choice. ~ they have more money to "compedatively inhibit" the opposition so they are not to be found in a hotel room with a woman they don't know named Rice. <br>  <br>  So, cruel cheating slaves to d ope abuse are in power because, once again, Women are not righteous.<br>  <br>  They insist that government cull from the heard an honest husband that can be culled. Non-bonded males thus due to their insipid lonesomeness are more vulnerable than the regular machismo guys.<br>  <br>  Nobody there to protect them from the Rice woman with a needle (no ~ I have no idea if "THE RICE" was a bad girl BUT IT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY GIVEN THE SITUATION THAT SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A VERY BAD unlicensenced pharmocologist with the principle cons serfative adgenda : charactor assasination by any means fair or foul).<br>  <br>  If you don't know who RICE is, it's because there are no righteous women.<br>  <br>  But hubby must be protected from antagonists. And you cannot likely do it. Because anesthesiology respects no vow ~ date r ape d rugs cause amnesia as well as anesthetize the "responsible" parts of the human brain (sometimes without apparently doing so to a camera or observing freinds or spouces).<br>  <br>  So hubby needs to be macho.

6gPCA7jHaa	Here are a few pointers, trust me I've done all of them. I gets it in.<br>  <br>  -Don't look at the booty while you are hitting it.<br>  -Think about sports or something else.<br>  -Jerk off before having sex.<br>  -Pull out before you bust and hold it for a few seconds until the feeling goes away then proceed.<br>  -Get Drunk.<br>  <br>  Stamina is key, she must get hers first, (a few times is preferred). Good luck.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	There are products at your local drugstore that will help with this problem.. They are cremes that contain a slight deadening agent to overcome your super sensitive response. If you want, you can try Kama Sutra's oil of clove. It not only has a deadening agent, it is a massage oil that is totally edible. Look them up on the internet.r|`|nfQhsRvfaa	1) You can have her give you a good BJ or HJ to make you go off so that whenever you do it you'll last longer or 2) when you feel like you're about to go off hold urself back and slow down a little until you feel like you can keep going again and not go off. That's what my husband does. ;)|`|An2KCMnwaa	I would try pills and exercise, Consult you doctor first.|`|CR8RVs4Kaa	Do kegel exercises. google it for men.|`|m2eHPeciaa	cardio|`|OEe5eOSIaa	Do a table of  13 <br>  13 times 2 is equal to 26<br>  13 times 3 is equal to 39<br>  13 times .. . . . . <br>  it works (Keep it secret ,dont tell any body )<br>  I am from the land of KAMASUTRA<br>  and SUTRA means  "a Formula "<br>  Thats the formula Baby

5vO61nuvaa	I bet it will be one of those old school punishments..  like making you wear your panties over your shorts all day so everyone sees you.<br>  <br>  And yes, you do deserve it, instead of forming little cliques you guys should all try and be friends with everyone.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	The girl that you picked on because she annoys you didn't really like being harassed by you . She didn't deserve being embarrassed in front of everyone. What you did is called bullying and you dear are a bully. You owe this girl a sincere apology and while we don't know what punishment is in store for you, hopefully you will learn that bullying is unacceptable.r|`|r9Cuqpw7aa	You deserve it, imagine being that girl...<br>  <br>  I think that what's going to happen o you isn't as bad as you and others have made her feel.|`|An2KCMnwaa	Are you for real?

How ever I doubt your school does that.

Later on in life you are seriously going to regret the people you were mean to.  That "loser" girl didn't deserve to be picked on.  Regardless of the fun you and your friends have together, that doesn't mean another person is going to understand it.  You were cruel and hurtful, and did a very unladylike thing.

JQ8d6QG8aa	My boyfriend did the same exact things when we first got together.but he started coming round bout six months into the relationship.i also got really frusterated and confused.but just let him know how he is making u feel,and even if he dosent say anything right away he is thinking about it.the reason for his actions he has trust issues.and is afraid of opening up...how is his relationship with his family??? via mother,and his childhood how was it as he was growing up? it seems to me like it is a trust issue...|`|pfeyoZGTaa	sounds like the strong silent type to me! tell you friend to be careful what she wishes for,instead he could be a right sissy crying all the time or instead of looking in her eyes while there making love he could have his eyes closed thinking of someone else.|`|Z933rtuLaa	Perhaps your friend's boyfriend is a man?<br>  <br>  As men, we don't share our feelings and emotions unless they reach an unbearable point where we have to seek advice.<br>  <br>  Since the dawn of time, we have kept our feelings to ourselves as they are our feelings.  We are primal creatures and we know that others understand our feelings because of our actions.<br>  <br>  Women, on the other hand, know they have to explain their feelings all the time because their actions are so seperate from their feelings!<br>  <br>  Unless a woman explains that she needs to hear she has reassurance in addition to having reassurance already through actions, then we don't think to express our emotions.<br>  <br>  After all, we're simple.  We don't ask you to tell us how you feel because we already think we know.  You just choose to tell us and expect us to do the same in return!<br>  <br>  Without Asking!!!!!!!|`|HrbEWwtfaa	maybe he's just not the type to share his feelings that openly, or maybe he feels that it's obvious that he's missing her, so there is no point in saying it, if you know what I mean...<br>  I know I have never said 'I missed you' to anyone of my boyfriends cause it's just not something I do.<br>  He may just be like that.<br>  As for the other symptoms, well the same could apply really.<br>  ^.^'
12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	I learned quickly never to let what people say get between you and the love of your life!<br>  <br>  My husband and I met when I was 18 and he 35.  I of course gushed about him to my friends and was suprised they didn't comment on how happy I was (am!) or how good we are together.  Don't let people's comments get between you and your man.  <br>  <br>  I am very protective of our relationship (and of him).  If you're going to be saying something bad about us I am not going to stay around to hear it.  You know?  lol.  I refuse to be disrespected like that and to have my "friends" disrespect the love of my life, my husband, in such a manner...and our relationship.<br>  <br>  Talk to your friends and tell them you love him and don't appricate their comments.  You love each other and have enough in common (esp 4 years!) to have a good solid relationship.  Let them know you seriously won't tolerate those comments!  If they continue to argue w/ you, leave until they're ready to really listen to your side and believe you can make your own decisions.<br>  <br>  Of course like I said I'm very protective.  Don't let anyone come between you both.  Good luck!|`|9yurQ85Eaa	I'm 28 and my man is 48 and we have been together for 6 years. Do not listen to what ofther people think. You guys are together their not with you. Age does not matter (only if its legal) .|`|PbESvbu6aa	who cares what people think|`|VHA9qrVSaa	Don't listen to other people views.  You live with him, you know him, he knows you.  You both love each other.  That's all that counts.<br>  Maybe those people who are talking negative to you are jealous of you.  Who knows about some people at times.  <br>  Go by your heart.<br>  Good luck to you both.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	People are always going to give you their opinions. My parents met in a bar, got married within 3 months and are 10 years apart in age. They both had children from different marriages. All odds against them and they have been married 31 years. IF you are happy, than don't worry about what other people are telling you.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	Sweety...please listen to what I am about to say to you.  Who cares what other people think! If you love him and he treats you good..who cares what these other people think.  Sure you could meet a white collar guy who looks "normal" but treats you like crap.  Is that the guy you want to go for.  Do what is good for you.  Stop thinking so much on the outter picture and focus what is on the inside.|`|KWYOetbiaa	this is what I think<br>  I don't think you love him, if u loved him u wouldn't care about what somebody else thinks about him or you.|`|AA11356977	Im 45 and my guy of 5 years is 23. We dont give a flying Fu** what others think or say, we are happy together and focus on that.|`|8rxXVBFuaa	Go with your heart and enjoy the moments|`|1epjqrflaa	You asked this question before. Listen, who freaking cares what your friends think about him or his friends. If you love him as much as you say you do then marry the guy! If you live the rest of your life so concerned with what others think your in for a very sad life. Do what your heart says. If this is you questioning your love for him and commitment then maybe you should take a step back for YOU, not your friends.|`|djUMvICoaa	Your friends have your best interest at heart and they are giving you good feedback.  When someone has to go around acting like 15 year olds I would question what is going on too.  That's too much like the guy doing and saying all the right things for all  the wrong reasons, to get into the panties.  Even your lifestyles are going to clash at some point, about the time you feel you can't go around any longer trying to make others believe you're in love.  Experience has told me that when it's love you don't have to do those silly things anymore, it will speak for itself.  But your head is swimming, those things have got you going in circles and it's all because you throw the words that mean so much around like candy you have to pass out.  The sugar is killing you.|`|lkBjzLuQaa	One good advice i'm going to give, Don't listen to girlfriends they are all jealous and they don't like it when you are happy.<br>  I had Friends like that the best thing l did was to get rid of them.<br>  The reason why my ex friends was saying bad things about my guy was because one had a crush on him. <br>  Me and my husband have been with each for 13 years and married for nearly 6 years and have 2 children and we are happy because we don't let no one tell us what to do.|`|B2cvkTp7aa	Quit listening to the friends, his and yours. Only you and your BF can know if you are right together. It is ok to be different, but you must each really think about these things.........<br>  <br>  1. Are you core values the same (can you agree with how your kids will be raised, do you both have the same goals in life, do you handle your problems the same way, etc)<br>  <br>  2. Are you both ok with a lifetime of not being into the same things? I would say if you both sometimes do the things the other is into, it is not a problem. However, if you never share each others experiences or resent having to, it will become a problem. <br>  <br>  3. I would say your age gap is an issue if you are 18 and he is 27, but not if you are the ages you are. You are an adult, not a little kid.<br>  <br>  4. Do your families approve of your relationship? Not a prerequisite, but it does help once you are married. <br>  <br>  5. If your friends truly "loved" him, they would not be against him. <br>  <br>  Now, after all that, there may be a reason your friends have turned on him. Is he controlling, or have you given up a large part of yourself to be with him? Or are you demanding he do that? They may have reasons for the concern.<br>  <br>  If none of that applies, then go for it. I followed my then boyfriend when he moved for work after 6 months of dating, but we both knew this was it. Everyone told me I was crazy, even though they all liked him. 6 years later we are happily married for a while now, and I have never regretted it. The way I looked at it was, I could always move back if we did not work out, but if I let him go, I would spend the rest of my life wondering if I made the biggest mistake of my life (which it would have been). You only get one life, and there is nothing wrong with a little risk. <br>  <br>  Still, you are the only one who knows how you each feel about each other, and if it is the right choice. If you have doubts, wait.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	you just asked this same question the other day. If you are that concerned about what others think, then maybe you should end the relationship<br>   Either ignore what they say, or leave him. ANything that will stop you from dwelling on other peoples thoughts and opinions.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	first your friends are women and no woman wants to see her friend happier then she is so they will always try to poison the well
nVuvJ8tmaa	To be honest with you me and my fiance have an age gap too.  I am 22 years old and he is 33 years old.But my opinion about age is that it doesn't matter. If you love each other than that all  is all that matters. A lot of people might give some grief for the age gap, but if you are both happy. power to you both and good luck.......|`|Ov5kGTjZaa	in a situation like this, YOUR feelings matter most. Your friends can't tell how you feel inside when he comes around, your friends can't tell how much love you have in your heart for him, I think you get my picture. If you think he is the one for you, go for it. <br>  <br>  Your friends sound a little immature, (maybe their jealous?), and your outgrowing them and perhaps thats why you get along better with his friends.<br>  <br>  I obviously dont know you, so I may not be right about this, but if it was me thats what I would do.|`|bv4pCCJOaa	If you have been in a happy relationship for four years, then whatever your "friends" are saying is ridiculous... You take into consideration how you feel and focus on that. However, something to keep in mind is that if your friends do not care for him, that is likely not to change if you are married, I'm sure you've figured that out over the past four years... No matter how unfair it is people have their opinions, so if you have to sacrifice something, be sure you make the right decision. It sounds like you already know the answer...|`|0Id85yiYaa	what's happening is your letting others' opinions gets to you when yours and your boyfriends is the only one that should matter. age isn't the problem, nor is your different styles. is you love each other, that's all that should matter.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	your friends honestly sound a bit jelous.  i dont think it is the age gap at all (though i wouldnt be surprised if they tried to work that angle), i think they see that you have a good thing going on, and they are mad that they dont, so they are gonna tell you **** to try and stop you from having that good thing<br>  <br>  sit down and address it with them.  say to them "i appreciate your concern, but i assure you, we are fine.  no one else has any of the issues you guys have with our relationship.  we are happy, and that is what matters"|`|zNjACkxpaa	it is an 11 year age difference.

Em00pBjTaa	i like the second one but you should edit it a little.<br>  i would just say something like this:<br>  <br>  Hey Alec,<br>  It's _______. I was just wondering if you noticed I was back? I mean I can see if you didn't... okay no i can't but still :D We've been friends so is there a reason you aren't talking to me? You know i've always been shy and i can never start a conversation. I really wanna be your friend, so maybe we can at least start by saying "hey" in the hall to each other.  I hate talking to people if I don't know if they wanna talk to me. i would really like to know if you want to be friends and start talking more too. So please respond and i'll see you on monday.<br>  <br>  the way you worded it sounded a little demanding. so i changed it up to make it seem like you were just curious and asking to be friends and talk.<br>  <br>  the 3rd one is super casual and really good. It just sounds like you want to get together and hang out again, rather than being desperate to talk.<br>  <br>  you could use either one, my edit or your 3rd one are good.<br>  Good luck!|`|kFC4ug3baa	If you want to go with one of the two, I would go with the second, but they both sound kinda desperate to me.  Maybe you could tone down the "I'll die if I don't talk to you" vibe you've got going...|`|mGzzvdK4aa	I very much prefer the second e-mail. <br>  <br>  In the first one, it looked like you were trying to force him to talk to you... which, in my case, is not the best way.<br>  <br>  All in all, please don't say you can't talk to people. No offense, but that is just plain dumb. The way you wrote, "I know how social you are and YOU have to be the one to start the conversation or else there will never be one." was a very bad sentence. It seemed like you weren't allowed to start the conversation at all. You get what I mean? Like there's a rule to that.<br>  <br>  As well, please don't type in capitals, it makes you seem very rude, and I bet you wouldn't want to be that way when you're trying to communicate with Alec. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uvl63dwlaa	neither...why dont YOU start the conversation if u want to talk to him so much?????lol why dont you use some of the second paragraph but be more gentil hes probably just a little shy or something. or you could just totally not send an email and one random day say 'hey alec whats up?' or 'hey alec what do we do in english?' just anything random! but be nice....lol oh btw the 3rd one is good too.|`|AA11280073	Neither one is very good. Just say that now that you're back you would like to get together and be friends.|`|tXNfNTg2aa	No offence or anything, but they both sound pretty desperate, just say something like;<br>  Hey Alec!<br>  How's it going? I can't believe your back! We should totally hang out sometime, if that's alright with you! :) <br>  Write me back when you get the chance! <br>  -____(What ever your name is)|`|T1NuEJbVaa	I think you should do number 2.<br>  Because you dont want to sound to desperate.<br>  (: Good luck hope you guys become good friends|`|IkHTD61Gaa	2 but i agree with your seccond answer. not to be rude|`|eB4hxi43aa	the second one sounds a little nicer|`|T6HTHXbcaa	2...
yQDxgLBPaa	Wow im sorry you sound like you do care for him alot. I mean not to be noisy but have you did the deed with him? If so that may be why he may love your personality and think you are a great girl. But hey guys are guys and he may tell you he misses you to get a piece he just may want a piece and not the commitment that comes with a relationship. So he is keeping you on his hooke because he know you care for him alot.|`|1D6LY5b5aa	It means that he likes you more than a friend but wants to get to know you more before he goes out with you. I mean i know he has known you for awhile but he might want to get to know you more as a girlfriend and think about if it will work out or not which im sure it will.
IvMPh09baa	oh yes... this is when one of us explodes usually.  Once one person lets something out and gets it off their chest, all of a sudden it opens the doors to a whole bunch of other stuff.  <br>  <br>  Its usual, it happens... it just means that both of you need to communicate the little things more often... because nothing good comes when you hold it in and don't talk about it... you only build resentment for one another and then you explode at each other.|`|buHzPMHZaa	Sure. An argument brings everything negative to the surface. You need to know how to argue so as to avoid unnecessary damage to your marriage. Little stuff that isn't important enough to worry about is often just used as fodder to hurt or to make a negative point. If you don't lose track of the need to resolve the larger problem, the little stuff will remain in the background where it belongs. I find that the best thing to do is to shut my mouth when I want to make a counter-accusation, and to focus on the problem. You need to keep your mind on the fact that you have to live with your spouse when the fight's over!|`|WU6pTTvCaa	What your not addressing is why you don't discuss any of your issues.  Apparently if you don't talk about it, it does not exist?!?  It could not have made things worse since those problems already existed . . . sometimes we just don't realize how unhappy our partner is about those 'issues' until it blows up!|`|wuBIF9aPaa	not me, but i've seen it happen.  it happens when couples don't communicate.  read this article.<br>  <a href="http://marriage.about.com/cs/conflictandanger/ht/fightfair.htm" rel="nofollow">http://marriage.about.com/cs/conflictand...</a><br>  its about fair fighting.  lot of good points here.  <br>  hope you can resolve your issues.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	Yes it has my dear...and now my tactic is just to give him his time whereas he regain peace.

Counseling should help, provided both of you are willing to participate.|`|mhvoPAOCaa	its probably best to just lay it all out on the table, so then more little "issues" don't pop up later on!!|`|nbm1RDoZaa	Not yet.|`|aEpPt9koaa	Yes it has. We are currently going to counseling to get past our issues. Its really helping, maybe you guys should try.
2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	Amen to that one sister.  People make no sense some times.
IiEyh0ADaa	That's a great question! I am 32 and getting married this summer for the 1st time. I see alot of my friends getting divorced and remarried already and it's tough for me to see when i'm going to get married in hopes that it lasts for the rest of my life. Yes, we argue a lot but that's only because we both have our own point of views and we express them. Sometimes i think arguing is a result that people aren't shutting their lips and listening to the other person. I think people should wait until they are older to get married. If i were to have go married when I was young i know i would have been divorced. It's important to really get to know who YOU are as a whole before you join with another person, because there are expectations in a marriage, courtship, relationship. Arguing is normal as long as it doesnt turn into a fight.|`|b02ff9ee4291024905544c49c4a3d511aa	It's not the amount of fighting, it's how they deal with conflict and disagreements that is important. It only takes one fight to break up a couple if they can't communicate with each other. <br>  <br>  I mean, yes, it's not so great if people bicker all the time, but it depends on the people and relationship too.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I think 2 things.<br>  <br>  1.  It's not about how often they fight, but HOW they fight.  If they just disagree and are respectful to one another and resolve their conflicts with love and compromise, that's fine.<br>  <br>  2.  Other people's marriages are none of my business.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	no. My parents fought all of the time and it sucked.  I know that you can't get along all of the time and that there will be fights, but it is bad if you are going at each other all of time especially for the children.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	It depends on the couple, some people argue in a healthy way, get out the frustrations and everything is fine......others are mean and hurtful when they argue.|`|PFmPcKbwaa	Arguments is perfectly normal and its perfectly healthy.  Don't bottle up the anger|`|0LlRUBWlaa	depends if they compromise on the issues|`|aPiRHsS9aa	no. If they argue now then there is no telling what will happen later.|`|roCnIlzyaa	Dating or Married... there is ALWAYS going to be fighting... no matter if it has been 1 year or 30 years...<br>  <br>  the amount of the fighting has nothing to do with whether the couple should get married or not..<br>  <br>  their heart has to be in it for all the right reasons.. and if it is.. then of course they should get married..<br>  <br>  no matter how much you fight.. you can't control who God made just for you.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Heck not it's not a good idea, it only gets worse.  Anyone who marries thinking things will get better are going to be the same people who think having a baby will make things better.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	If they want to... They are adults, they should make the decision. I generally think that just because other people's relationships don't resemble mine, it doesn't automatically mean that they're going to fail. Whether or not to get married is a very personal decision, to be made by each couple individually.|`|IvMPh09baa	they are arguing because they care about each other and are having a breakdown in communication.  SEriously.. you need to grow up, EVERY couple argues... its a fact of marriage... and if a couple doesn't argue that would be more concerning if they get married.  Because if there is never an argument, that means someone isn't speaking up in the relationship and saying what they feel... trust me, nobody absolutely nobody gets along 100% of the time... arguments will ALWAYS happen.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think we all have a different level of tolerance for conflict.  I think that two people with the same level of tolerance for it can work it out in their own way.  The problem is when a person with a high tolerance for conflict marries someone who doesn't.  jmo<br>  <br>  As far as who will divorce, flip a coin, because it is 50%.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Depends on what you mean by "all the time". <br>  <br>  Frankly, if there aren't some arguments...one of you isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  But generally, yes. I think we embrace every reason to get married except the idea that the other person will be good for us and need us. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10460376	I absolutely agree because if they cannot get it "HALF-WAY" right before exchanging vows, how in the world can it possibly get better?....People deceive themselves because they do not operate using reality.........
CoEGQxN6aa	Do you really want a girl from a strip club.  Remember you can't change people.  They are who they are.  She probably flirts with alot of other guys...thats how they get their clientel.  Women will sometimes flirt and hold back as they reel you in and have you hooked...then all of a sudden your paying for their lifestyle, hair, nails, clothes, rent, car etc....you'll be one of many guys doing this.  Not to say that all people from strip clubs would do this but I advise caution.|`|jfX8aWWtaa	It looks like it.

Ask her out. What can you lose?|`|fHA6zk07aa	I guess she does.Maybe you should buy her a rose or something nice like chocolates.

A lot of people just play each other in a place like that.

1Xt7KLiMaa	By the sounds of things, i think that your used to keeping to yourself and haven't really experienced a close friendship or relationship so you do not really know whats out there.<br>  Your 21 and your life is still ahead of you. Many people do not find their loved one or true friends until later in life, those that find them early are just lucky. I never really enjoyed what ive studied and to this day, i still have a very hazy idea of where i want to be in life. Its nothing unnatural or out of the norm, so i wouldn't say that you have much to worry about.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on things you do have control over in your life and make the best out of your current situations. Sounds like you should also find your support either from family or friends as it always helps, as well as being healthy, to have people close around you.<br>  Don't give up on yourself too easily, you never know whats around the corner.<br>  <br>  Good luck
g3l5f9iwaa	Wow this sounds like a trying situation. Congrats to you for being so resilient. Sounds like you have brought some acceptance, love, and understanding to the situation. I think alcoholism may cloud a persons thinking. I wonder if he, underneath it all, thinks the world of you and your sister. It sounds like you've been handling it really well. Perhaps you could find out more about alcoholism as a disease, and get some insights into just what you can expect. Have you tried going to any Alanon Meetings? They are meetings for people who are in the lives of alcoholics. It's a support group. I think you can find out online or in the newspaper if there are any meetings in your area, there usually are. I hope things get a little easier for you. Best wishes.
4IHe4rPYaa	yes do it!|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Don't get worked up over what you heard your friends tell you that this girl said.  That's what you call "he say/ she say shitttt."  See, your friends could make up lies and come back and tell you that this other girl said the lies and have you fighting her for no reason.  If you HEAR her saying bad stuff about you, then you tell her to "shut her fukkkkin mouth before you whoop her damn assss and do it real fast!"

I think if it is financially difficult for a couple to split outside of declaring bankruptcy, they may stay together until the housing market rebounds.|`|qtOTa4iAaa	Last time I heard couples were sticking out because of the downturn in the economy and it makes sense.  Loss of jobs, homes, etc makes it necessary to have two incomes versus one if you be so lucky.|`|XMIpSxfmaa	women are getting Richer men poorer|`|dIw7MqTdaa	Can I predict 80:20?|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	The rate has already started to rise.  The bad thing is that when people rich the age around forty they all seem to have troubles anyway.  The economy is really going to make it worse.  Men have a very hard time dealing with the stress of having no money and they feel very responsible to support their family so it really messes with the family life.

PpQ9v6F0aa	wow. finally someone that gives a crap. (:<br>  <br>  well. i know this is silly but i had a boyfriend in 5th grade. i liked him so much. ever sence 1st grade when i met him i liked him. haha. i even remember asking him what his favorite color was and that became my favorite color (orange). i finally got the nerve to ask him out. okay my friends did it but im glad they did. we stayed together for a year and a half. it was awesome. i really liked him. then i was being stupid and one day when i was hanging out with my best friend he told me he liked me. and i was stupid enough to tell him that i liked him too but i liked (insert my ex-boyfriends name here) more. he said he really liked me. and im a sucker and when he asked me out i said yes and broke up with my boyfriend (stupidest thing ever). the worst part is, is that my and my best friend only stayed together for a couple of days!<br>  i still miss my ex-boyfriend and its been 4 years... ): and i still have the neckless that he gave me for my birthday.
oNkxVdSjaa	that she luvs u??|`|7K2HVodhaa	How old are you?
AA10408380	Its' a control thing. Its a boredom thing too. It could stem from jealousy. There are many reasons. My ex married me for sex and money. When he realized I wasn't a prostitute, and my parents don't like being blackmailed, he let me go. But the main issue was his parents interference. All they ever talked about was money. And how since my folks have an abundance, they're obligated to all of it. Then they'd tell my hubby that I would sit on my butt all day and do nothing around the home. She would forbid me to do anything, and kick me out of the kitchen. <br>  <br>  Hearing all this would make my husband abusive(the actions he chose), and his parents would laugh. See, our misery was a sport to them. They wanted us miserable because they wanted to make sure he'd let me go if their demands weren't met. If he was happy, that couldn't happen. See, now...he can do better, but he's still piss poor. Many in laws are like this. They like what they see and hear about a person, so they tell their kid to marry said person. But then when u get comfy and the real u pops out, feathers will be ruffled, but no one likes that. U, be it man or woman, in arrangement, must be perfect in the eyes of relatives, or risk ridicule and interference.<br>  <br>  It's a part of indian life when u live with folks. In reality, ur kid's partner is never good enough for them in ur eyes, because u always see someone better. That's y it's up to ur kid, to set u straight and say I like this person, so deal with it. the interference will never stop...but it will diminish when they realize their kid will turn a blind ear to their laments.<br>  <br>  Oh, note to ur other q, many indian guys won't marry girls who aren't virgins, and many girls now wont either. So if u do "try b4 u buy" then if u choose not to buy, u have to keep mum about ur past...and act the part of a virgin...lest ur partner feel insecure. Plus, some do hav sex with  the intent of marriage, but then change their mind once they got the milk. It affects the females more than the males because everyone checks backgrounds, and there are many closed minded folks who value virginity and think that a virgin whore is real...and even if they are, if drives differ, offense is there. The expectations are unrealistic n high. Plus, in cases of virginity, no one believes the other, because u expect the other to lie about their pasts.<br>  <br>  In the west, there's more compatibility because no one's turned off by a person with prior experience, or offended with one of no experience. Such is not the case in the East.|`|HAk6iROaaa	Well, it's cultural, but also, everything in India revolves around family and extended families, the greater community. Everyone cares that they are not frowned upon and everyone wants acceptance, nobody wants to be an outcast. But I think alot of the interference comes from deep rooted insecurity and just lack of class sometimes. I think all that interdependence is not a good thing....|`|AA11695632	Indian women are mostly house wife and they have nothing to do so they are into gossip and spice up their life by doing all you see around.. Have you wonder why men always does things to the point ?  because they have plenty things to do and worry for. They have responsibility to move forward in life.. so They an not spent time doing all that... If you feel something is not right.. you have to get away from there as they will not change as that is their life.. If you have problem yo only have to get away from them as their system and way of life is well established and nobody can do anything to that..|`|Ug0xxINnaa	Especially relatives, I mean ladies are quite interested in gossiping, I don't mean all but yes some of them are.So they search for topic.And whenever they get it, they talk about it.<br>  <br>  If you feel they are interfering then very respectfully answer in one word answer.Show that you aren't interested in answering.I guess, that would be enough for them to understand.But don't disrespect them.|`|BuztPXvDaa	we are indian, u know very well about our culture, there are a lot of time to do gossip. 95% ladys are house wife in india. they have time for time pass. so they have to do these type of gossip. they dont want to break others mrd life but this the habbits "idher ki udher karna" . i m also in joint family. u should not care for these things.situtaion become critical when man involevment increase. so, try to convience ur wife to avoid "chugli". if some bdy says to her thn dsnt care" ek kan se sun kar dusre kan se bhar nikal do"
bO2rzfISaa	He's not a great dad if he doesn't have regular visitation with his kids. That's how you define a great dad.<br>  <br>  I have children of my own, but being a step-mom is harder that I could have imagined. I'm talking about relating to the kids. Also, they have been raised totally differently than my children. The expectations I have of my children seem unachievable for his, because their mom literally hasn't seated them at a table, doesn't treat their medical issues, doesn't support their educations and on and on. This may not be as important if you're not a mom yet. It may become more important if you have kids later.<br>  <br>  The mom who hates you could become a real problem.<br>  <br>  Think long and hard, especially since he's a lackadaisical dad. Unparented children make VERY difficult step-children.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	I'm just curious how he can be a "great dad" if he "doesn't see them hardly at all"? A good dad would be in court fighting for time with his kids...not waiting outside of their houses to spend an hour with them. Something doesn't sound quite right but I'm sure there's more to it than you mentioned in your question. I know it's tough for fathers to get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to child custody but if he's got his act together and wants to see his kids than he needs to take their mothers to court and make it happen.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, to answer your question, dating someone with kids definitely isn't for everyone. The kids should be #1 in his life, and then comes you. Having to deal with the exes could be problematic and just annoying to deal with at times since most exes like to act crazy for no reason especially when kids are involved. <br>  <br>  My husband has a son with his ex-wife and we've been through hell and back trying to make it work for all involved. I also have a son from a previous relationship so when we got together it definitely had it's rough moments. Even now that we've been together for 5 years, living together for 3 years and married for 5 months, we still face the challenge of being good parents to our own kids and each others kids. My ex isn't that involed in my sons life which is fine with me but my husbands ex is always around since they have a 50/50 custody arrangement. I honestly can't complain about how things have worked out because my stepson is the coolest 11 year old in the world. And my husbands ex and I actually get along. It wasn't always easy but we both agreed that it was easier for us to accept each other and get along for the sake of the kids involved than to hate each other for no good reason. I really think that my situation isn't the norm when it comes to relationships that involve kids and exes but I think it shows that if you really want to make it work then it is possible. My husband appreciates the effort I've made to get along with his ex because it really makes his life a lot easier in the long run. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to support your BF in getting more time with his children. And if you are going to continue to date him you need to understand and be supportive of the fact that his children should come first. If you are there loving and supporting him through that then you'll have a strong foundation to build your relationship on. Hopefully yours will be a success as much as my experience has been.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	He has 2 kids with 2 different mothers?<br>  <br>  He needs to go to court and get set visitation.

Well lets see, you will be able to deal with some baby mommas for a long time & that will NOT always be fun. You will have to put extra money out every time the baby mommas ask for a child support increase. You will NOT enjoy those annoying calls from the baby mommas calling when they have no real reason to call but they do anyway because they just seem to like the fact that they "think" they are annoying you, which they will be.<br>  <br>  If your wondering, I have dealt with my late husband and my current husbands' ex-wives and these are just some of the things I have had to deal with and the messed up thing, my current hubby's children are both adults & mom feels a need to be a pest and I truly believe she does it just to make me angry.<br>  <br>  If you truly love your man, just know what could happen in your future & don't let what could happen ruin a good thing between you & him.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI

It's been that way since the pyramids and it isn't going to change. It's the way our species functions.

LZqHQTZpaa	I've ended up talking about beds, tv programs, why she shouldn't marry me, and just other random rubbish. anything that comes to mind, I used to talk about school but then it developed into scientific advances, and how brains work that interested me and kept her talking for a while without awkward silences, this is mainly because i like my subjects but people tell me I shouldn't, I should talk about other more common and interesting stuff.<br>  A good one is talking about what music she likes nad if she can recommend something for me and then discussing the song.<br>  As I said just probe his interest into something you think he'll like but you are also interested and have a tad of knowledge.|`|r3xuKqakaa	anything that comes to your mind , random conversations can lead to interresting ones , happens to me all the time .|`|vtafeEIJaa	talk about money|`|HinSwo97aa	happens all the time.<br>  i'd talk about school, tests, music, news, tv, bands, etc.<br>  ask him about hanging out or going to the movies.<br>  that'll get you into discussing movies.<br>  i'm sick of having this problem, so i've become a completely random person. i talk about anything anywhere, so if you just bring up anything, it'll work.<br>  even say your mom or sister says hi or something. or, just talk about anything that comes to mind.|`|ldQFvpHxaa	just play it totallly cool, dont act like your nervous, just like ask him what hes doing for the weekend or other COOL stuff. hope this helpss (:|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll ask his favorite hobbies, sports, food, movies, books, ect.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Q6BcFTM8aa	ask him what kind of bands he likes|`|Z6JFpquWaa	there is a book by a guy named dale carnegie called how to win friends and influence people.....basically it states that most people love to talk about themselves if you center the conversation around him(growing up,family,music,hopes,dreams,fears,favor... food,color ect)theres bound to be no akward silence and hell come away thinking you both said alot and have so much in common trust me this works.|`|P3OWfxi5aa	hmmm...this sounds interesting lol<br>  but heres some ideas : music that you like and what he likes, sports, and things you like to do on weekends and stuff. maybe even make plans to hang out with him. just whatever you do please dont trash talk people...ive done that before and guys HATE it<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]]|`|Tu0n9Mkkaa	hey im the same age...and i used to have the same problem. my friend nick liked me and there was still akward silence. ask about what bands you could listen too (that he likes, of course) and also, appreciate the silence. guys have no problem with it, and idky girls do.|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	Talk about your interests... talk about family life, sports, what you are both doing this coming weekend....<br>  at that age, it is easy to talk about anything!!! Play the 50 questions game! :)|`|yyMRQkEmaa	TALK BOUT WHAT YOU LIKE TO DO IN YOUR SPEAR TIME...YOUR FAVORITE THINGS....FURTURE...|`|SQ2FKKayaa	talk normal ask him if he dose any cool stuff|`|ahDBFy8Haa	play with him and. if hes lame. eff him
5qnUV5U2aa	been there.... you'll just have to realize when you're ready that he's a tool and you need to move on so you can be mega happy with the guy thats waiting for you, go out to places make friends with strangers make yourself feel like the hottest chick in town other guys will notice and maybe one of them will distract you from thinking about the old whats his name. take yourself out on dates (ok not weird like though) but go to the movies go to dinner or go out by yourself someone will notice and will be probably doing the same thing. just try hard to meet new people and make a new circle of friends that doesnt include the old guy so you can stop being insecure about it and realize you dont need him that there are probably a million other guys that are hotter more intelligent more respectful and caring and loving and real men not immature guys that want to act like "players"|`|r3xuKqakaa	forget about him .<br>  <br>  try getting to know other guys , and who knows he might be better than your ex , and if you're really into him then you'll probably fall in love with him and forget about your ex , you won't even think about him . <br>  and if your ex and his " best friend " ever end thier friendship ( it can happen , maybe they're just doing that to make you jealous ) . he'll realize how happy you are with your new guy friend and realize that he missed out on alot , because you never know what you got till its gone . <br>  and by that time , you won't wanna be with your ex anymore .|`|kkM8vFfKaa	This guy obviously doesn't care about you so don't waste your time on him. try not to even cry over him, he's really not worth the stress and tears.<br>  What you first need to do is cut all ties with him. Rid your life of this guy. Take his number out of your phone, delete his myspace, don't email or instant message, and get rid of everything he's ever given you. This will keep him from distracting you and it just hurts more that way.<br>  Next you need to get out and do stuff. Make sure your schedule is jam-packed! Grab a couple of close girlfriends and go out for a night of fun. Dress up and make yourself look awesome! Other guys will hit on you and it will boost your self esteem and confidence. Go to the movies, to a club, or dinner, or shopping with friends. Gra some ice cream. Have a close girlfriend stay with you for a couple of days to distract you from him... to keep your mind off of this guy. If he calls you, ignore his calls. Give him the cold shoulder that he once gave you.<br>  You might find yourself periodically thinking of him, but you'll notice that it will become less and less, until eventually almost never. You'll get over him, it just takes time, and you <br>  HAVE to want to do it, I promise.<br>  Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|eVPkWZU4aa	My suggestion is, if this guy can get over you and not worry about it, whatever feelings he expressed to you were a lie and that is probobly what made you fall for this guy...just let him go find something better than him to think about because i know there is better out there than that|`|fRQHpKCPaa	Move on dont even bother, pleny of other guys who will treat you better. Dont waste your effort.|`|0mbv4AHJaa	there are plenty more fish in the sea.<br>  you're young
d4ZtRg0Daa	I would say to those preppy girls "Get the hell away from me because I have a new friend and sorry for wanting to be myself! And she is NOT the reason I cut myself [but cutting yourself is very bad. Please stop...? You can be different emo because emo is all about being different and rebel and stuff right? But anyways...] I'm being myself and she is more of a friend any of YOU will ever be!" Then I would walk away and never talk to them again. But hey, it's your desicion. But please stop cutting yourselves. It's very unhealthy and do you really want to waste your life when there is people out there who are worth living for, I promise! Well, I wish you VERY good luck!! :)

He probably just wants to meet new people. When he has your whole friends list THEN you should probably say something... lol. Well I hope this helps somewhat! Good luck! :)|`|GZtdISjNaa	What's the problem|`|jMkmzP4Vaa	im sorry this is to complicated i can't answer this im so confused!
ZaMzRSrraa	WHY??? do you want to smoke in front of her now?......let it go.....I snuck around for years in my teens...even though my parents finally figured it out.. I still didnt smoke in front of them until my 20's..even then .. never really around mom..just dad- he was a smoker too.<br>  Died from drinking actually and not smoking!|`|jdVxsK4yaa	2 b honest i dont thnk u should say anythin.<br>  i smoked a few times n my fam. has no idea n dats how its gona stay!!!|`|AA11280073	If you are underage and you smoke, you are breaking the law.

Ev3fFui4aa	Yes you can!<br>  <br>  A good personality trumps looks every time - even a guy who isn't initially that attractive can be made attractive by a nice smile, or a good sense of humour, or degree of intelligence.<br>  <br>  I'm wondering if the stumbling block for you is lack of confidence in yourself..?<br>  <br>  Believe that you are worthwhile as a person, with a lot to offer a young lady!!  That will shine through, and is an attractive quality in itself.<br>  <br>  Your mum's opinion is hardly important or valuable when it comes to attracting a girl, I wouldn't worry if she hasn't told you you're attractive!!<br>  <br>  There are things that you can do to improve or make the best of yourself - make sure you eat healthily and do some exercise. Make sure your clothes are in colours and cuts that suit your shape and colouring.  All these things will give you a fighting chance.<br>  <br>  And most importantly - believe in yourself!|`|a9x4o0mFaa	if you want the brown hair brown eye look you can get colored contacts and dye your hair the color you want and see maybe if that does anything...or you could do the blonde and blue look if you don't want contacts and you are open to dying your hair then dye it blonde<br>  <br>  you will find someone don't worry i believe in you<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|WxqeMSw7aa	I have a friend who goes for "ugly" men and she is quite nice. She says good looking men are boring and up themselves.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Yes you will find someone. A relationship shouldn't be based on looks alone, those are the relationships that don't last long. Don't worry about what others have said. I had both males and females call me ugly and it hurts, I admit it. I can bring up so many stories of when I was told this. I know it is hurtful, but in the future, now, you need to let all of that abuse go. I started working on my confidence, before I would look in the mirror and think I was pretty and then I would think of my flaws or think of a time when someone had said I was ugly. I am working on it now for the past couple of weeks, it is working great. When I go to culinary school, instead of hiding or standing by myself, I would just go sit with people and talk with them. I would joke around and speak louder. I am learning to accept myself because I am pretty in my own way. And you are handsome in your own way. You mom may not be so open, or she may have said it but you may not remember. I never heard my mom said that to my brother but she thinks he is, but she doesn't want to embarrass him.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it. You are a handsome guy and you sound nicer than other guys out there. Just start working on your confidence and start building it up. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Build-Self-Confidence" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Build-Self-Confid...</a>|`|Tf19RETiaa	awh nobody is ugly, and brown eyes so arent that "amazing"<br>  blue can be gorgeous too, dont worry, you will find the right girl.<br>  im waitin for the right guy. good luck ~|`|GUmZuVFRaa	Well you won't know until you ask someone out.<br>  <br>  And since when did girls really fall for "greek guys"?, I never heard of that.|`|EIzs2OWeaa	Picture please!! But you don't sound ugly.|`|xxd03wBOaa	Not all girls are shallow like you think, just project your personality a bit more and be confident with yourself. By the sounds of it, you seem not confident and that really shows and when a person isn't confident others can feel that and it makes you less attractive. Also about those feeling, everyone gets them, it's not nasty or anything, actually saying it would be but if it's just the odd thought, it's fine. Sometimes it's just your care towards someone. Also not all girls go for brown eyes brown hair. My best friend's bf has brown hair and grayish eyes, i think or a definite variation of that. Though i'm sure she liked him even when to me, he looked like a decent version of Jesus.|`|06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	I'm 21, never had a girlfriend, and I feel the same way|`|QS3PtXg8aa	the right one will come along,its sooo true<br>  <br>  =]|`|DozD8lTGaa	obviously you will find someone. but, don't keep putting yourself down! you cannot be that bad. everyone is attracted to different people and you will find someone! honest.<br>  <br>  think positive and DON'T keep putting yourself down... maybe your Mum isn't that kind of person to compliment people or she just never felt the need to say it ; all parents think their children are pretty/handsome (well most anyway) <br>  <br>  good luck and you WILL find someone ;) x|`|0OaW7CD8aa	those girls arnt good enough for a great guy like you..ull find someone perfect for you..trust me..lol..|`|z3QsWmzpaa	yes you will find someone one day you have just got to wait and if you want brown eyes why dont you get coloured contacts or something just be confident and comfortable in yourself and just be yourslef around girls and they should hopefully see the real you how kind and sweet you are and wont judge you on your looks <<if there not shallow any way <br>  <br>  good luck and hope i helped =]|`|pssezVkDaa	no your not to ugly to have a gf. some day you will find some one some day will find that you are good looking and ask you out or tell you that your hot. don't give up|`|8EnlSE93aa	yes you will, i promise(:<br>  good things come to those who wait.<br>  pleaseee remember that and dont get yourself down too much.|`|47iY7d5Laa	You will probably find someone.<br>  <br>  Most girls in the teenage years will cherish guys that are "hot."<br>  <br>  When they get older, they start to realize that looks aren't everything.<br>  <br>  As long as you have a good personality and you just be yourself, you should end up attracting some girls.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't want a girl that just dates a guy because hes "hot" anyway.<br>  <br>  Also, many girls secretly crush on guys, and they never tell them.

I've felt like that from 13-18 and just around 18-23 I feel a little better about myself because I've made physical improvements and matured. <br>  <br>  You just have to find someone that you're comfortable with. And trust. If a girl says yes to you, there was something there that she really liked. <br>  And good thing for you is, boys are more shallow about appearances than women.

It can open the door to  start a conversation.  Don't ever be pushy....If the girl is into you, she will smile back, play with her hair, look into your eyes, mimic you etc.  If you lack confidence you won't get anywhere.

I would never have wanted to spend any of the time apart from him. <br>  <br>  Due to certain circumstances in our lives, though, we did get married when I was 21 and I am glad.

BUT, the road i took with him led me to the man i am with now.  if i could go back and change antyhing, it would be that i would have met my current love sooner.

QPp7zQQpaa	Hot chicks go out with guys, they don't concentrate on school and regret it later when they can't find good jobs. Hot chicks are fun to be with, but after a few lines "Like...yea" "OMG! that is sooo...." they do get boring.<br>  <br>  Being able to keep a conversation, knowing about what you actually learned in school and building yourself a future IS a bit boring at times, but it does not mean you have to turn yourself into an airhead.<br>  You can still have fun and still attract guys with the difference that the ones that will look for you will look for you because you have depth as a person. <br>  And looking nice is a matter of taking care of yourself, not about showing bodily parts.|`|aBqJhdufaa	So many things in common... Except I'm not really ugly.<br>  <br>  Try listening to more music.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm a guy, and it's not all about only hot girls, it depends on personality, too.|`|7G8jNBtiaa	Not everything is about looks, and it's really good that you are concentrating on your schoolwork because that is what really matters. Listen though, if you ever need advice about beauty/makeup/looks you can always email me or my AIM screen name is thexITxgirl xo<br>  I've always been pretty good with beauty and makeup and what not, so I can try to help you if that is what you're looking for.<br>  If not though, stay positive and focus on everything else you have going for you, which seems like a lot! Good luck!|`|nyCW1Xt5aa	Take matters into your own hands. I know what you are feeling like I had the same issues a lot. So I started running, went to the mall and had them do a make over so I knew how to do my make up right. I started going places where I could meet people. I also started taking better care of myself getting my hair and nails done and it gave me confidence that I needed and people noticed and I started making friends and dating. But I think if you give your self some time this stage will ends soon.|`|Wa6pdoVfaa	Ok, first of all, i bet ur not as ugly as you think you are. When any of us look in a mirror, we are looking for the wrong things so that we can fix them. So to ourselves, we look worse. Try look for the good things. If I were to look at you, like everyone else, I will look at you as a person, not as you look at yourself.<br>  Not all guys want skinny girls with big boobs and a nice ***. There are many different guys with many different interests. Your time WILL come.<br>  Allocate yourself time to do school work and time to do fun things. Like for example:I'm going to study for two hours then go for a swim or something. Dont spend forever on school work. Our social lives can be just as important.<br>  Try make new friends. Join a youth club or a sports team, you are sure to meet new people who share your interests at a club or team.<br>  Like I said before, your time will come for a boy, dont rush into anything or anyone your not comfortable with just for the sake of "having a boyfriend".<br>  We can chose our friends but we cant chose our family. All families can be boring at times! Try see the good in them. At least you still have them.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Oh honey!<br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear that!   I am assuming you are a teenager.<br>  <br>  Those are tough years!  <br>  <br>  When I was your age, I hated my life too.  Little did I know that when I was grown - I realized how I had so many opportunities I didn't take advantage of because I was focusing on the negative!<br>  <br>  First of all, I am sure you are NOT ugly!<br>  <br>  Second of all - guys are stupid.<br>  <br>  You think that guys just want hot chics?  Have you seen how many ugly guys are out there?  You think they are all going to get these hot chics?<br>  <br>  LOL!<br>  <br>  No honey!<br>  <br>  Second of all - you need to start feeling better about yourself.  All of your thoughts are showing your self-esteem is really lacking.  You say you feel bad about how you look.  Ask your mom, or aunt or older cousin to see about doing a makeover.  Have an older cousin or aunt or mom do a makeover on you.  See about coloring your hair or getting a cute new haircut or something!  Do something fun with yourself<br>  <br>  I know when I feel a little less then attractive - I try something fresh and new.  And I always feel brand new after I get my hair done.<br>  <br>  Anyways - try this to see how beautiful you really are.  <br>  <br>  And then get involved sister!  Join a club or team or something.<br>  <br>  This is how you make friends.  Common interests.  You don't make friends by sitting on the computer at home, getting down yourself.<br>  <br>  Get involved!  Even charity work!  What do you like?  What are your interests?  Figure that out and get involved in it.<br>  <br>  And focus on that.  <br>  <br>  Once you feel happy with yourself, relationships will start to come.<br>  <br>  All by themselves..... I promise
JKWq4N7Faa	Regular kids definitely do NOT act like this. <br>  You need to have a serious chat with your mother about this. <br>  I'm afraid your younger brother could turn out to be a possibility of many bad things when he gets older. <br>  This should not be normal. You need to stop this asap. He could be affecting the kids at school, or influencing them to do bad things as he is. <br>  Oh and btw, congratulations on your pregnancy. :)|`|IAwvWPgxaa	First of all..children of 11 years of age AREN'T supposed to be allowed to say that..that's just not proper and its SUPER rude...Your mother should not be afraid to discipline your brother cause she should know that if she leave her  child like that, it may cause him to become an irresponsible adult and that will lead to his and his parents ruin...|`|kNT7fzY7aa	It sounds like your parents did a much better job raising you than they are doing with your little brother. Most of the problem with your brother is caused by your parents lack of disciple and structured upbringing. A child should never be allowed to be that disrespectful. It sounds like your brother needs a good old-fashioned a** whipping. You certainly don't need his smart a** around you and your child.|`|aiSFRcYsaa	I don't mean to be rude, but i think your brother needs to go to a correction center , for his own good. Otherwise , people at his school are going get fed up  and he will get in a fight with them , and that will go on his record and he won't be able to get his dream job. Only tell your parents about what you have done once you have done it, because from what i hear about your parents your brother has them under his thumb. I think he is part of some gang which they beat parents up if they tell about their criminal behavior.|`|7ac469783dee56b4277a1312c2a5a72baa	He needs to be locked up. His is sick and your parents are sick for allowing that to go on. Your Mom is  wrong. If one of my children did that I would knock there block off. My grandchildren do not talk like that. As I said your BROTHER is a sick person|`|oIibWodnaa	I think the way he acts will end up making him someone everyone hates and will disrespect so if he wants respect he will eventually learn not to be a little ********.|`|1mvW2PHPaa	Oh! Your question is so long! look here <a href="http://www.exclusivestarvideo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exclusivestarvideo.com/</a>|`|ph8IcueRaa	You are just scared because your 11 year old brother sees you for what you are.|`|IV9rRpl8aa	I honestly think that he shouldn't be saying things like that. Yes kids will be kids but not in that way. I really think that his mother should get on to him about it.|`|Y53xwCmbaa	At first i was thinking its ok at that age everyone is saying those kinds of things but if it has been going on since he was seven maybe he has some issues and thoses youtube videos will teach him all he needs to know about drugs trust me there is everything on youtube and the sex videos he will probably become sex craved!!! and  masterbate and did you know guys can give themselves blow jobs but anyway id be careful around him he might get into trouble|`|h6NqNzHAaa	You are married and expecting but still live with your parents and siblings? Get your own place with your husband and solve all your problems.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Your mother and father are victims to your brothers viciousness. <br>  If I was you I would talk to my husband about moving far away from the folks and baby brother. This kid will kill them eventually, do you want you and your baby, let alone your husband, also be his victims?<br>  Get the heck away from that nut case and your folks.<br>  You can tell them good bye and tell them if they ever ditch the brother they can see their grandchild but not as long as that creature is still around abusing them.|`|6Pckjqlsaa	hmmm that's terrible...<br>  It is hard to discipline a child when their own parents don't do anything.. the child won't listen to you because you're not their parents. The only way is to get the parents to restrict their internet and Tvs times and sites....<br>  <br>  it is also a hard time to prevent him to stop anything since he's raised like that..|`|wqrycWlEaa	He sounds like a little b*stard!<br>  And that your parents are afraid to discipline him<br>  You need to sit your parents down and tell them the situation and make sure they listen to you as this won't stop unless they do something about it<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|gCoqslUGaa	no offense but he needs to be displended the old-fashioned way|`|GZtdISjNaa	clock him one.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	that's unappropriated behaviour for anyone of any age. Congrats, by the way. I think your mom should discipline him. Kids will be kids but they don't have to be jerks.|`|SdDvbPf0aa	next on jerry springer|`|rCWc7m3Iaa	wow thats really bad, that kids gonna grow up to be... idk, just bad.|`|rjBmDEZRaa	call the tyra show or something lol...but srsly|`|Rf9vw4fjaa	wow.<br>  no offense, but i REALLY hate your brother|`|Is5iWTNdaa	Firstly l would not be letting anyone talk to me that way, maybe your husband should have a word to him and set him straight about you and the baby, l would also be letting your parents know exactly how you feel and that you wont be allowing such behaviour around your child, as he is going to be a uncle this is not the enviroment you want your child exposed to. sounds like your brother has some serious issues that need addressing and l wouldnt trust him to be around you or the baby until this is sorted out, he sounds horrible and it will only become more severe as he gets older if the problems arent nipped in the bud now, do you want a 16yr man pushing you around who will be bigger and stronger than you???|`|nyCW1Xt5aa	What I think your parents need to do is beat his butt and take everything good to him away. He is a brat and if you don't live at home don't put up w/ it. If you want to see your mom and dad make it at your home w/out your brother if they ask why he cant come over tell them. Stand up for yourself and don't play the victim. Once the baby comes make sure your parents only see it when you are around cause he could do some scary stuff by the sounds of it.|`|rFlhIgJXaa	Were i your parents i would have curbed that the instant it started... I suggest sending him to a therapist as giving your kids a smack upside the head when they do stuff is looked down upon (not sure why, i woulda turned out better had my parents given me a smack or two... which they did not even though in retrospect i truly deserved a couple)<br>  <br>  You are 100% right in that you should be allowed to have some time off for your baby and yourself (in fact i think it might be a right... or at least maternity leave etc) and your brother, i am sorry, is an 11 year old that is in need of a smack.<br>  <br>  Sorry i HATE it when i see kids doin crap like that... and im 20!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Your mother (no offense intended) is somewhat deluded if she really believes that "kids will be kids" when i was 7 to 11 i was not running around using vulgar terms, swearing and smacking my sister/brothers around... this is a serious issue.<br>  <br>  EDIT2: As other answerers have stated, yes your brother does need help as he is exhibiting behaviour that is very likely to lead to worse behaviour in the future (drug use, dangerous crimes such as assault, murder, rape)... not saying it is for sure, but it does not seem impossible.
7gH7sgi6aa	You should start spending as much quality time as possible with your Grandfather.  He is indeed a very sick man.  No one but God knows exactly how long anyone has left on this earth.  I was once considered terminal with Cancer and I made a comeback after all treatments were halted.  I cannot explain why, but my tumor shrunk small enough that they were able to remove it surgically finally.  I am now a three time Cancer survivor.  Remember though that when we die we are passing on to the next life, the better life with Christ.  It is a better life, and one day you will again join him.  He will be watching over you everyday.<br>  Love your Grandfather now.  Remember all the good times you spent with him and just know he's had a very good life.  Be a good grandson and support him.  Good luck.  God Bless you all.  You will be in my thoughts and prayers.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	It sounds like his cancer has spread and he's in palliative care (basically keeping him comfortable for the rest of his life).  You need to talk to your family and ask them to be honest with you about what's going on - it's always worse trying to imagine what's going on rather than just knowing the truth.  The loss of appetite could be a side effect of chemo if he's still receiving treatments, if not, though, it's usually a sign of the body starting to shut down.  Life expectancy of terminal cancer patients really depends on the aggressiveness of the tumours - it could be weeks or even years.  This is all speculation, however, as you don't know how advanced his disease is or if he's even terminal at this point.  Talk to your parents and tell them that it's very important they be honest with you.  You're obviously too old to not notice things that are going on and it's really better for you to have the facts so you can understand what's going on and make decisions about what you want to do at this point.  If he is terminal you may want to spend some time with him learning about his past and hearing some stories, or you may want to start a project with him that you'll be able to keep in the future.  Also, don't be too upset with your family... they're trying to shield you because they love you, not because they think you're stupid.<br>  <br>  I very much hope that his situation isn't the worst case scenario, but whatever you find out I hope you find a way to deal with it that makes your relationship with your family and grandfather stronger.|`|7ko9czaaaa	the best way to find peace in this is talk to god he will help you and your granddad get thought this,|`|QPp7zQQpaa	The massages are used to drain phlegm from the lungs. They are called postural drainage and you could help him a little if he wants you to.

Is there a specific reason that your father doesnt want you to have your pic on facebook.  Have you tried talking to him openly and honest and maybe go on the site together so he can see what its about.  Its good your dad is strict, it shows he cares but maybe you could come to a compromise.  Talk to him and share what your doing.  Dont be secretive it only leads to suspision.  Im sure yous can find a way to have a giggle about it, get him to sign up, then he can understand have fun and keep tabs on you all at the same time.

They way how they did this that they got married and be friends forever I think we can say it's ok...They could have like fake wedding - with parents only and stuff... I don't know, it's hard to say.... It is just so hard to refuse if you know that the baby is going to die soon... Very hard, very....|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Yes        Why get married, they really are not married but living a dream.  How is this going to effect the young man when his "wife" dies.  They are to young to really understand the consequences of the actions of their parents.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	yes, it is too young, even with the circumstances.  they could have just had a pretend wedding....i think thats a little overboard.|`|30c80fd1b17a3706bf5570a2557e2287aa	Generally speaking yes of course it's too young. However considering the circumstances it seems to be a very sweet and innocent thing to do for a young girl who is dying and will never get married otherwise. Most little girls dream about their wedding day in some form, I think it's touching that she was able to have a version of one before she dies.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	They only promised to be friends for life and she is going to die soon.  In normal circumstances I would say 9 is way too young, but this was innocent.  It is hard to say what is right and wrong when an innocent child is dying.  It was touching to watch this knowing she only has a short time and that her husband (friend) will be devestated when she is gone.  My prayers will be with these families.|`|AA11706291	This isn't really a marriage as they vowed to be friends forever rather then man and wife. If it had been serious where these too had vowed to be man and wife for the rest of their lives (regardless of how little time that might be) then it would be wrong however in this case it is just making a dying little girl happy by connecting her to a friend and I can't see how anyone could deny her that.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Well she's not a typical 9 year old and her circumstances are a little different and, I mean, let's face it.. how long is she going to be married as sad as it is? But they still could have had a fake ceremony.  I think at her age, it would have meant the same thing to her.  Who knows.  Nobody is in her situation.|`|SovaFpN8aa	This is a heart-rending story. Under these circumstances(she is terminally ill, and the groom is 7), there is nothing wrong with it.

At the same time, there are other things which she could be doing in her last weeks which she will understand and enjoy. Marriage in this case really seems for the sake of it, loosing its meaning.|`|fSO7kfdGaa	I think that 9 years old is way too young to get married, but and this is a big but. The link you showed seemed to be a good reason though I think it was more of a pretend wedding since they said they would be friends forever. It was a sad and beautiful story. I feel really bad for the pain of the children having cancer and their families. It sounds like they made that little girls last wish come true and I don't find anything wrong with that at all!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	In this situation,  no. This girl is dying. This isn't going to be a real marriage. It's a life experiance for her that she will miss. Why not do everything you possible can. I think it's sweet.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	way 2 young.  even with circumstances as they are, the "bridegroom" is expected to live.  how will it affect him?  i wonder what the parents were thinking?|`|dIw7MqTdaa	2 years old is old enough to have sex. 3 years old is old enough to get married.|`|Ev3fFui4aa	She's not a real bride - it was a pretend ceremony because she is going to die.<br>  <br>  If it was my child I'd do anything to make her happy in her final days.|`|r9soQ5inaa	I believe under these circumstances it is completely ok.  They did it as friends and it is very sweet.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	I read your article in the link.  I honestly think that is one of the most retarded things I've ever read about in my life.  Seriously.|`|D1NhxI2iaa	In my opinion I would say that 9 yrs old is WAY to early to even think about getting married  ...|`|dfPqakmsaa	That's freaking crazy!|`|nbm1RDoZaa	yes<br>  <br>  it is not okay, no matter what|`|TPbVJqm8aa	yes...|`|kbz5S3waaa	that is so sad, I'm sorry that any child had to experience her situation, I kind of feel like it's okay for her though...|`|uBssj3Znaa	um ... yes!
34b40Vu3aa	You need to let go of your need to be so clean.  Why should he be the one in the wrong?  You married him expecting him to change, that's on you, because he wont.  Let go of some of your need to clean otherwise you will continue to try to do everything yourself and go insane.  Work with him, make a compromise, that's what marriage is.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Throw the DOLT out and tell him he sucks!|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	"Now I said to myself that it will change n improve etc. But now its been 6 months after marriage and its worse."<br>  <br>  I'm sorry , sweetie, but marriage does not usually change a person. The only thing you can do now is to plead with him and let him know how unhappy you are. Do not act mad, but just let him know you love him and want your home to be nice for him and you just would like a little help. Maybe he could pick up the groceries, some men don't mind that.. Good Luck - affy|`|zFx7NT2Baa	Well stated and somewhat common situation.  My wife is more like you, me like him.  She and I are much in love and respectful of our differences.  She chides me occasionally about how messy I am; I chide her about cleaning the house before the cleaner (which I pay for) comes about every two weeks to clean the house.<br>  <br>  Three suggestions. Get a cleaner to come in.  Agree that some parts of the home are his to keep arranged neatly, others yours.  Lossen up a little.<br>  <br>  None of us change much in our lives.  He and you will need to accommodate the differences each has.<br>  <br>  Good wishes.|`|C4rVwbi7aa	counseling yesterday|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	As hard has this may seem....Stop!  Stop serving him, stop picking up after him, make him cook for his self.  Basically what I am saying is go on strike and tell him that the strike will continue until he agrees to have a grown up conversation about all this mess.  This is very unfair to you.  You should not have to live like this.  Marriage is a partnership and you are the only one who is contributing to the relationship.  Oh, one more thing, tell him it  you do not care to have sex with a person who has no regard to your feelings.  <br>  When he finally does decide to sit down with you, tell him the minute he starts yelling you will walk away.  And stand firm.  Of course you have to remain calm in all of this so that he clearly gets the picture.  <br>  Adults can have a disagreement without the shouting, besides the minute someone starts shouting, no one gets heard.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	He doesn't care about cleaning as much as you do. He's trying to say that you do all of that because you are obsessed with being clean. He is not. The way you think and the way he thinks are two different things. But to say you don't love him because of this? What kind of love do you have....apparently it's conditional. Marriage is work, which means he has to work at understand you, and you need to work at understand him. If either of you is unwilling to do that, than the marriage won't last.|`|AA10240683	You knew what he was like when you lived with him. Just because you get married does not mean things will change. People get a very big dose of reality check when they expect someone to change once they get married. People do not change on demand or when they get married. You knew what he was like before you go married, deal with the reality.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	you really need to try and work something out between the two of you.  you knew how he was before you got married and it sounds like you expected him to change after you got married.  as long as you are doing everything he will not do anything.  if you can't work it out then stop cooking for him and cleaning up after him. this may sound like a childish way to may a point, but it does not sound like there is anything else wrong in your marriage, at least you did not mention anything.  don't get pregnant, because with a neat freak like you say you are this could end things.|`|NZ2tS11maa	Oooh, you sound like you are in the same position my mum was for years and years. Her problem was, she simply picked up from where my grandmother left. My dad never had to do anything for himself...it was always done for him. The guy didnt even know how to make a cup of tea!!! <br>  <br>  Have you simply picked up where his mum left?<br>  <br>  Well the good news is, it is fixable.....not easy, but if you love each other you can work through it.<br>  <br>  My mum tried speaking to my Dad (it went in one ear and came out the other). After arguements she would go to a b&b for the night and come back the next day. Dad always knew she would come back, so nothing ever changed. One day it just got so much that she walked out, and he started panicing after 3 days of her not even speaking to him. She actually didn't go back for 3 months. In that time he had to learn to do things for himself...and realised how much he took for granted.<br>  <br>  When she came back, he was a changed man....he even enjoys doing the hoovering (something I thought I would never see). He still doesn't do any cooking, but he is happy to do the washing up, and tidys up. Mum still does most of the work, but he makes an effort to do bits and bobs, and it has truely changed their lives....this all happened after 35 years of marriage.<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to talk to him when your both quite relaxed, tell him how upset you are that you dont get any thanks for your hard work, ask him to take on some of the chores. If you don't get anywhere, then you may have to take drastic action. Maybe go away for a week and let him see how he gets on. I'm not saying it is easy, but you are the most important person, and you have to make yourself happy even if it annoys someone else. Wish you the best of luck (sorry about the essay)|`|djUMvICoaa	You went into this with your eyes wide open, you knew what he was like, but you thought you could change him.  Bad mistake.  That should have been done before marriage.  So now you have a control freak on your hands, do the things when he says and what he says.  He is also abusive, getting mad over the little things that should have been worked out.  He got his maid, what more did you think he was going to want out of this?  The good part, you don't have that much vested in the whole thing, it's hard but I think you have to walk away for your own health.  He is so disconnected that he doesn't care how these things hurt you or how his words do.  How did you miss that in those 4 years?  Or were you going to change them too?  You learned a lesson the hard way.  Next time watch those things that grate at you, remember you can't change them, and I'm sure you'll make a better choice.  There are plenty of guys that help around the house, I'm one of them but it can take a little time for Mr. right to come along.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Just stop cleaning and doing all the work. It will drive you crazy but he will notice when there are no clean dishes and just say well I do them all the time, and it's your turn. Same with the laundry. He is used to you doing it so he doesn't have to.<br>  It is childish, my fiance is like that too. Once I stopped doing the dishes and ignored them for like three days he did them and it got the point across. I just left his laundry in the washer and it got all moldy, guess what he doesn't expect me to do it. <br>  We are getting married in november and I'm glad that he cleans more and makes an effort to pick things up. Because once we are married I know things won't magically change so I'm glad he does it now and is used to it. <br>  You could also sit down and have a talk with him, but don't make him feel defensive or act like his mom. Just point out that you do things to make him  happy all the time, don't you deserve the same if you love each other?|`|mhvoPAOCaa	What did you really expect??? He is a man, and perhaps you are getting a little over-reactive.  Some men were raised to believe that the woman is to do the"wife's' job..for a long time that was they way it went.  I say get over it.  I do the same stuff here.|`|xw495UB8aa	Tell him to help you out around the house. And possibly give him an ultimatum as a last resort.|`|N1SwM3oOaa	Tell him, couple should share housework. Make a schedule and ask him to execute.|`|AA11427354	I am a clean freak too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Have your husband clean after himself like if he leaves his clothes around the house have a hamper that he can throw it in. Have a system like certain days he dusts, sweeps, etc and you do other things then the next week you switch it.  As for food maybe he doesn't know how to cook simple meals. Set up a day where you both go in the kitchen and teach him how to cook simple meals.  Also have a day where he serves you have him cook for you clean the House and serve you for a day. Also try going out for dinner or having a day to pamper both of you where you both don't work a day off. If he refuses to do this go to counseling or leave because he wants you to make him happy but if he is not willing to make you happy don't bother.<br>  hope i helped|`|b02ff9ee4291024905544c49c4a3d511aa	I've heard the first year of marriage is the hardest because youre both getting used to things. <br>  <br>  Sit down and have a talk with him. Divide up the household duties and figure out who is doing what. Don't give him things like cleaning up or vacuuming because he'll probably slack off or won't do it because he doesn't consider it important. Try laundry, cooking, or grocery shopping... I doubt he'd put those off. <br>  <br>  I don't know much else you can do except just divide up the chores and attempt to talk to him. If he doesn't change you need to decide if you want to be the one picking up after him and doing everything and working for the next 50yrs or so.|`|jbCdumTzaa	I'm not too sure how well it'll work, but if you want, you might as well try this. So basically, clean up all your things, etc, etc, etc, but not his. Hopefully, it will make him realize just how much work he makes you do, and maybe then he'll help you clean up all all of those other chores. I don't know if it'll work, but probably will help.|`|utGddhnVaa	meet in the middle, compromise|`|FXCoGD44aa	First : You knew what you were getting into before you married him. The day you married him, you agreed to love him for who he is. No where in your vows did it include a clause that said, "Your behaviors before we were married I was able to put up with, but after today I expect you to totally change." <br>  <br>  Second : "Our communication is only fighting." There are many different KINDS of communication. If the way you are relating to each other now only leads to fighting, then you both need to apply a different strategy. Go to the book store and pick up some books that focus on marriage communication.<br>  <br>  If you guys still can't figure out the correct way to communicate and compromise on this, then you need to be in marriage counseling. End of story.

Em00pBjTaa	i was in the same situation as you when i was 13. My best friend and i went on a vacation with her family to florida. She had always been a bit boy crazy and always wanted to flirt. but i hadn't really realized that she was really sleazy. on our vacation she met a boy and they hooked up a lot. and when we got home she told me that one night she snuck out and slept with the boy. i was disgusted with her. i was still friends with her though because i knew who she usually was, not just a ****. But she continually got worse. and she eventually got what was coming for her and had a naked picture of her sent around like three schools. She's smart so i couldnt believe she had done that. but i toughed it out and helped her get through the embarrassment. but she still didnt learn her lesson. She parties all the time and hooksup with random guys, treating sex like a joke. I knew i loved her regular personality, but she got too carried away and even when me and my friends told her she needed to chill out and stop messing with all the boys she wouldn't.  Then one day she completely betrayed our friendship by lying about not being able to hang out, but she was actually having sex with another guy. Thats when i ended it. i still see her in the hallways but we're no where near best friends anymore. more like aquaintances. i found ALOT better friends with better morals and im a lot happier now. <br>  <br>  in my opinion, if she won't listen to your advice, you shoudl stay away from her. She'll just drag you down with her morals and thats not a great path to take. You will be a ot better off leaving her before she hurts you. No matter how hard it is to stop being best friends.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped. and sorry it was so long.|`|gUp9lLIxaa	You two need to confront her together, Like Immediately! She really needs you guys right now, listen you need to say it seriously with a serious tone not a high squeaky voice like "You did not just do that!"<br>  If she uses sarcasm tell her right off the bat "Were serious and we don't want you getting hurt by people you don't even know, what if the next person you go after is criminal!"<br>  <br>  And if she doesnt get it she might need parental help too, I know you dont wanna tell but she needs the help if she doesnt listen to her closetst friends<br>  <br>  And if that fails, then you might have to end your relationship with her, I dont think you want to end up like her :\|`|XOoxPm0gaa	As hard as it may be, if she is that young and having sex, you may have to confront her parents about it. That is the hardest thing that you will ever have to do, but it sounds as if she is really messed up and confused and this may be the only way to truly help her.

GfGRj3Y0aa	maybe you can sip a drink on a warm beach in your back yard (if you have one).  set up some type of theme in your house and send an invitation to the two of you stating a free trip or something.  you don't need to spend a ton of money, but use your imagination.  imagination is something we are losing in the age of technical.  create a romantic theme right there in your house.  think about it, I know you can do it.  don't let him know what you are going to do.|`|wwB3csfYaa	Go on a little road trip to a resort. Even more fun is if it's possible get on a train to go there. Get ideas from expedia.com, they always have these cool vacation packages. Going to vegas is really cheep but not chill at all. There are all kinds of hotel resorts that offer extra activities all over as well. I wish I knew what state you lived, it would make things a lot easer!|`|StoXNDBAaa	We went to the beach.<br>  <br>  But I always thought you could visit a state each year and that way by your 50th anniversary you could say you visited all the states.  <br>  <br>  But I suppose that doesn't help the money situation....|`|kHLwlNA5aa	We went out for dinner.

This very well includes a night where we pitch up a tent (in my large enough back garden!) and lie down, watch the stars and simply talk.<br>  <br>  Simple, but sounds perfect to me.|`|Ev3fFui4aa	Mu hubby had to work, but we did a long weekend in Paris the following month.<br>  <br>  I think as long as you're together, away from your normal lives for a few nights, enjoying spending some relaxing and carefree time together, that is a fantastic celebration.|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	On each anniversary my wife and I go back to where we had our first date.

92n42vksaa	This is a good chance for you to realise that you shouldnt put so much on another person, its not fair on them and risky for you. Im sure you have lots of reasons to be alive. You just need to look for them! You need to look for strength within yourself and get other help to stop doing these things. You need to extend your own support network so that theres more than one person you can turn to when you need help.<br>  Her moving away doesnt mean she has to disappear out of your life for good either. You can keep in touch online and by phone and if she wants to, she can still be there when you need someone to talk to. I hope you dont make her feel bad about moving away. Make plans to stay in touch instead. Its much better than having a best friend dying or turning against you because physical distance isnt a barrier to true friendship.
GLKD89wnaa	You are right your husband is wrong you should think about your child 1st.|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	I think you are both wrong.  He for wanting to cut one of his children's college savings and you for cutting the other.  You agreed to be a step mother to his daughter so she is yours too.<br>  <br>  I know times are tough, but please think of cutting your children's college funds as a  last resort.  They are the future and their college funds will help them build the future they deserve.|`|N3qaHrmCaa	it would be completely cruel and unreasonable for you to cut off your step-daughter's college fund especially since she'll be going there next year.  As other people suggested pay what you can afford and split it half and half between the son and daughter.|`|buHzPMHZaa	Sounds like you're both too hardheaded to compromise.

I don't understand why you can't cut back in other areas instead (ie no going out).|`|99d4ebSUaa	Wow, Bridget <br>  <br>  I do understand where your coming from. You Kind of feel she has You, a Mom/dad and as a mother you have to make decision that is in the best interest of your son. The money is coming out of your check, her mother is not doing anything. <br>  <br>  Hopely, your husband will see the need to jump into another Real Estate Market such as Loan Mods, Shortsales, Rentals. Depending on where your located or do something.<br>  <br>  Maybe, he is mad because your son will be going to College in 7-8 years and his daughter will be going to college next year. He may feel it is better for her to get the funding being that she will be in school before her brother.<br>  <br>   He is just going to have to figure out something else, find out what kind of scholarships she qualify for and she can get financial aid.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	Recommendation compromise, split the amount to go to both children, or if you cannot afford it stop the college fund all together, until things pick back up.  Leave what is in their funds in there, and look at other ways to save.  Does your child need a private education?  There are several great public schools. Do you need the big house and the cars?  Look for creative ways to make $$.  The problem is that he may feel a little immasculated because you are bringing in the $$ and he isn't.  These are trying times but hold on to the love you have for each other.|`|XLQ9wCUaaa	If the girl is going to college next year it seems rather cruel to cut off her college money at this point. <br>  <br>  I guess one would hope that by the time your son is ready for university/college that he can get a scholarship or that the economy will have turned around, which it is likely that in ten years' time it will.<br>  <br>  It seems wrong to target his daughter though simply because she isn't your child. It isn't her fault that her mother has a 6th grade education. I'm sure their father loves them both equally and is trying to be fair. These are just the types of situations one gets into when they create blended families, I guess.|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Well I hate to tell you but you're BOTH wrong but you more than your husband.  You're wrong because you stopped contributing to the daughter's college fund out of spite & that's a real immature, low-class thing to pull.  Why would you try to punish him by denying his dauther the college education she needs?  That's horrible.  You're both wrong because instead of talking like PARTNERS, you both went to your corners & tried to hoard everything with a "this is mine!" attitude.  That's not a marriage - that's roommates who happen to live in the same house.  When you're married, you look at both kids as FAMILY period - not "his" or "mine."  Your child should never take MORE precendent over his.  That's bull and it's a very immature attitude that will only cause division in the marriage.  <br>  <br>  If you're having tough financial times and the ONLY savings you have are the 2 college funds, then I agree with your husband - the son's fund should be tapped first.  He's EIGHT for goodness sake.  The market will recover & you'll have more time to pump his college fund back up.  His daughter is just about to leave for college in a year so there's no time to make that up!  It just makes logical sense.  <br>  <br>  Obviously you shouldn't touch the college funds unless it's absolutely necessary.  When I read this, my first thought was TAKE YOUR SON OUT OF PRIVATE SCHOOL.  Private school is extremely expensive.  I went to public school and got a great education!  I'm pretty sure it would be better on everyone if your son sacrificed by going to public school so that....i don't know....you can continue some semblance of good quality of life and so that BOTH kids can go to college.  But hey, that's just me.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	Everything you just said aside, the problem is that you're focusing on who's right. There isn't a simple right and wrong with this, and you shouldn't be putting your son before his daughter. The impression I get from you is that when push comes to shove, you'll take care of yours before you help him and his, which shouldn't even be in your mind. It should be "ours" when it comes to everything between you two, especially the kids since they had no say in anything. They're counting on you to take care of them, and putting one in front of the other will only strengthen the division between you. <br>  <br>  His daughter, which you should treat as your own, is only 1 year from going to college and you want to pull that out from under her? How does that make you look? How does it make him look? There are plenty of other ways to cut back and save, and your kids future shouldn't be one of them.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Cut back college savings for both accounts by equal amount, if you can't swing both.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I see that you feel your son is your first priority. But when you married your husband you knew he had another child, so he's not just  man that you married, you took him as a package deal, with his child as well. I think it's great that you pay child support.  I think it's wrong to stop the college fund for the girl. Your husband is right, she will be off to college before your son. Plus if her mother is a drop out, then you don't want the girl to follow in her mothers foot steps, you should want the best for her. <br>  <br>  Besides, the market and economy won't be like this forever. So I'm sure you will be able to save for your son before he's ready for college.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|AA11538662	If you stop one kids fund it's only right to stop both to keep the peace with hubby.<br>  <br>  If you just started the fund for his daughter last year, I would bet it's safe to assume that fund does not have much in it and if she's going to college next year, there won't be that much more in it.

And mom should be helping her as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck figuring this out and keeping the peace with hubby.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I think that if you stop one, then you stop both.

She is going off to college next year so she needs the money sooner.<br>  <br>  Your 8 year old has many years until he goes to college, so theres lots of time to make up for it.<br>  <br>  You say as a mother that YOUR child is the priority ......but your husband has 2 children that are HIS priority.<br>  <br>  I agree with another answer, why not just put half aside for now while times are tough?<br>  <br>  Also.............your step daughter will be finished college, and child support will have ceased, by the time your son even gets to college.

She needs money NOW!<br>  <br>  8 year old son: 10 years till college. He needs money in a DECADE!!<br>  <br>  Plenty of time to put MORE money aside for him in the future.<br>  <br>  What this boils down to is....you've never taken responsibility for marrying a man who has a child. That child now becomes YOUR child. No questions. No exceptions. None!<br>  <br>  Who cares who the mother of this girl is? Just goes to show that you look down upon YOUR DAUGHTER, you belittle YOUR DAUGHTER, and your marginalize YOUR DAUGHTER'S value.<br>  <br>  I have GREAT SUSPICISON that your husband ever held back time love and attention from your son.<br>  <br>  Your persecution of YOUR DAUGHTER is over. <br>  <br>  She needs the money now...so give it to her. After all, your son has time that YOUR DAUGHTER does not have. <br>  <br>  There will be plenty of time to put money away from him. But right now the DAUGHTER has need of it.<br>  <br>  And drop all this "Thats MY child and thats YOUR child and this is MY money and that's YOUR money and YOUR child's mother is a loser while MY child's mother CARES and blah blah blah".<br>  <br>  You married this man. You married him. You CHOSE to adopt his daughter as your own. You CHOSE to involve yourself in a child support situation. <br>  <br>  Those were YOUR DECISIONS. <br>  <br>  How you can back out of them now is sickening. <br>  <br>  Your husband is 100% correct. <br>  <br>  You are 100% wrong. <br>  <br>  Now go correct your mistake.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	If it is necessary to stop college saving to might more critical bills such as food and housing, cut both. If not keep paying on both.<br>  <br>  The way the economy is going and the amount of time it will take for it to come back up, you have to settle in for the long haul. Both of us lost our jobs last year. Believe me, we aren't arguing about savings of any kind, as we are too busy trying to figure out how to pay our mortgage and still have money left over for food! Prioritize and quit arguing!|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	Marriages, like any partnership should not have your money and my money. It should all be our money.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	he is wrong you cannot have favoritism in a marriage with children the is other alternatives|`|9KIICFdIaa	I think that is one thing that neither of you should do, for his child or for your child.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	That is so wrong.  Like it or not she is still his daughter and she is closer to graduation than your son.  I say split what you are putting in your son's account in half.  This way you are still putting some in both accounts.  As a mother you should be concerned for both children not just the one you gave birth to.   It doesn't matter if her mother is educated or not.  You are giving his daughter a future and a better life.    It seems selfish of you to not think of both children equally.  Be the roll model that she needs you to be and one day she may look back and be forever grateful to you.|`|AA11024148	you probably won't like my answer, but......<br>  stop paying on both for the time being.<br>  let's face it, the first year of college is 'party year' so let her pay her own way for the first year. if she likes it and wants to continue her education then you pay for 1/4 her second year, 1/2 her third year and 100% of her college education her forth year of school if her grades are up to your expectations.<br>  by this time your 8 year old will be 13 - 14 and you will have plenty of time to get his college money going again.<br>  if your son decides to go to college make it the house rule that the first year of college is up to the individual; after that you pay like you did for the girl.<br>  <br>  NEITHER IS RIGHT OR WRONG|`|krQiDGCHaa	Your first priority should be both your children -- your step child is your child too.<br>  <br>  You two are being ridiculous in my opinion.  You shouldn't eliminate ANY college funds.  Here are what are RESPONSIBLE options:<br>  <br>  1.  STOP going out all together, don't just cut back.<br>  <br>  2.  Eliminate HALF of both college funds, so that each child still has something, but no one has nothing.<br>  <br>  3.  If you need to eliminate more than half of both, then eliminate more than half of both, but cut them back EQUALLY.  <br>  <br>  It is completely unfair to treat one child better than the other, and to be honest with you I pity both of your children for having such unreasonable parents.  Poor kids.|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	I can fully understand your sentiments, no one in a blended marriage should favor their child over their spouses, it is a recipe for Disaster. However looking at it in a practical way, your son is still about 10 years away from college, the girl is only 1 year away and you have only started saving for her education a year ago. Make a "Deal" / Agreement with your hubby that you will suspend saving for your son's college for 3 years unless the economy turns around quicker and allows you to begin his account earlier, BUT at the end of 3 years you will resume. This still allows you a minimum of 7 years to accumulate a tidy sum. Or you can also suspend the son's until the girl turns 18 at which time Child Support stops, and then apply that sum to your son's account....which gives you 9 years of saving. Pick your battles wisely, seek solutions that ultimately work for both of you, you know full well that someone must give a little in order to get a little. Defuse this situation before it damages your relationship.
zWYfAWSOaa	Do you have any dreams for your future?  Imagine if you worked really hard for many years to make your dream a reality. Then forces totally out of you control threaten to rip things away.  He is overwhelmed and probably second-guessing himself so much.<br>  <br>  He had a dream, to own a home to be proud of and have a family to share it with.  He probably underestimated how much work it would take, how much time away from you.<br>  <br>  I know my husband really regrets how much time he has been spending working late at a job he'll probably be laid-off from in a few months.  He missed so much from our son's early years.  He felt compelled to try to get ahead.  Our culture puts a heavy emphasis on material acheivement for men to have a strong sense of self-worth.  <br>  <br>  Imagine, feeling like you aren't worth much!  He feels so low now.  Like he's wasted years of his life. Just be there for him, hug him, you don't need to talk much.  A simple, "I will always love you, Daddy" will mean more than you will know.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	So he is trying to find a way for you to go on the field trip and YOU snapped at him? <br>  you might want to find a way to be nice to that man you may not have him much longer, he will die of heart attack from over work, and then your heart will hurt for years.|`|45b12e3a23b254dfa86c1f9333066f2daa	Becoming a stripper is one way young women get their father's attention.  Hopefully it won't be your way.|`|03GQ637Raa	Your father built the house for his family.  He worked his butt off to give his wife and children a beautiful home.  Here is an idea you can try to let your dad know how much you and your family appreciate him and love him.  Make a scrapbook.  The first page should be a poem from daughter to father.(look below in the source area.  I provided a link to a poem website that is perfect for you to get a poem for dad), Then gather some pictures up like your baby picture and pictures when you all as a family are having a good time  i.e.  picnic, birthday parties etc.. and at the end of the book put a gift cert. for restaurant (don't have to be expensive) and have a daughter/dad day. Daughter dad day should be just hanging out, going to eat and talking.  Last but not least, go on line and check out real estate properties that you think your dad can afford.  You can get a part time job to help take care of one of the utility bills.  Just take a moment, collect your thoughts and see what you can do to help dad out right now.  Oh one more thing, tell him a joke a day, something to make him laugh.  Wish u well.|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	The fact that he's working so much to keep the house that HE built with his own hands for his family says a lot! Tell him that if worse comes to worst, you know he could build another, better one when the economy picks back up, and no matter how big or small, you know it will be just right!<br>  <br>  I believe that God made men to work with their hands, and I don't mean by tapping a keyboard or pushing buttons- I mean hard labor! There is a certain sense of pride and accomplishment when a man builds something with the sweat of his brow and the blood in his veins that cannot be matched by things like writing software or designing skyscrapers on paper. These types of accomplishments can be hard to let go of sometimes, especially when it was intended to benefit the whole family. Your Dad isn't just trying to keep the house he built; he's also trying to preserve his dignity and integrity as a father and provider. I, for one, can relate to and respect that. With the economy the way it is right now, he's fortunate to have 14+ hours' worth of work to do every day. I'm lucky to get 8 hours a week! <br>  <br>  Love your Dad and thank God that he's not one of the deadbeats!|`|drp30rf5aa	I am shocked at how UN-insightful the people are on here.  Jeez.  You love your dad and want him to realize that he doesn't have to do these things to be a good father.  You want HIM - not his money.  I am assuming that he couldn't take you to your play but was still concerned about it.  The fact is that he needs to stop the pity party and not burden you with statements like "I'm not much of a father."  If he thinks that then he needs to stop trying to make money and worry about the real commodity that is evaporating quickly - his family.  It's not that I don't understand that he is a man and these things are important; it's that my dad is dead and I don't give a **** what the man did for a living or how much money he made or where we lived.  I want him back and can't have him because he felt that he wasn't a "good" father.  I know where you're coming from.  You can say to your dad, "Dad, I love you.  I know that you are giving all of yourself to work because you love me and you want the best for me in life.  But I'll tell you what I want.  I want to spend time with my dad.  I want to know my dad as a person.  I don't need any of these things.  I need you.  We get one time around in life and I don't want to be denied the opportunity and privilege of being with my father.  I love you.  Please do this for me.  Spend time with me and give me you."  He'll appreciate it.  I now that the house is important, but in reality, it is bricks and mortar.  You are human; so is he.  He is irreplaceable.  You can live anywhere.  <br>  <br>  It isn't your job in life to "make" your father feel better.  He is the adult.  I have two kids, I know.  There are times when I want to say to my son, "Jesus, I'm a real person.  Get off my back and realize that there are things that are important to me, too.  You aren't the only person on earth."  But guess what?  I'm the grown up.  I don't want my kids to have a job - the job of making me feel better or staying out of my way so I can pursue my own dreams.  I want to give them what they need and I want our only life on earth - a short time - to be valuable.  Nothing else matters.|`|QPp7zQQpaa	Go find him, look at him in the eyes and say thank you, from the bottom of your heart.<br>  <br>  Then tell him that he is a great father, but there are things he has not control over, and that does not mean he is less of a father.<br>  <br>  Tell him you want him to be there when you are older, and for that he needs to take things a bit easier and that no matter what happens he will still be a great father.<br>  <br>  God bless you for being such a great daughter.|`|ph8IcueRaa	If you were my daughter I would beat you to within an inch of your life then beat you some more.

So I like it when girls try hard to get. Like when you didn't sit next to him that showed that he isn't the only person you want to be with so your being hard for him to take reach don't let him control you and try to make him mad as often as you can by being difficult to get and not a needy girl who only wants him as a boyfriend and not just a normal fun friend.  This will make him want to you more

XZlFLecLaa	ive dated a guy that was younger than i was by 2 years .... it was ok because he was mature for his age... but typically girls mature faster than boys and i feel more mature than most girls my age ...., so im dating someone older than me now... but <br>  <br>  to answer your question... nope - nothing wrong with a girl dating a younger guy... its all up to you and your tase!|`|f5kZwH2Laa	It was good that you wrote him the letter. You obviously have some kind of feeling/attraction for him. At your age I myself would feel kind of awkward dating someone younger than me especially because you are in high school and he is still in middle school. It definitely isn't wrong for you to date someone younger than you. I mean you aren't apart by much maybe just the separation of yourself in high school and him being in middle school would be the most awkwardest part.|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	Two years younger is not bad when you are 22 and he is 19, but HE'S 12-13.

If u r 25 and he i 23..its ok. If u r 16 and he is 14, then its bad.

It seems like a bigger difference now but im a junior and he is a sophomore and its not a big deal at all. No one really thinks anything of it.<br>  <br>  Plus if you like the guy why should you care
yFX0mdOhaa	It's obvious Rob is very attracted to you.  Anytime a guy pays a lot of attention to you, whether it's positve, negative, or joking, 99% of the time, it's because they really like you.  Guys don't spend time joking around with girls they don't really like, unless they are simply good freinds otherwise.<br>  <br>  The question is how do you feel about him?  Do you like him?  Is he a nice guy?  Why do you like him.   Don't decide you like him just because he likes you though...many girls will date a guy, and feel excited because they like knowing that someone is attracted to him.  I can guarantee there are probably a dozen or more guys that are attracted to you, most of them just don't have the guts to talk to you.  Don't let other guys choose you... you have to choose the one you like, and go after them.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweety!!|`|9p70ijUgaa	They're just being stupid boys, don't you hate that???  Yeah, next time, just say "Oh yeah, sure rob, and i won't be late this time.." but really annoyed and sarcasticly so he doesn't get the wrong idea, and if your guy friend writes more letters, just take them, scratch out your name, and write his name on the bottom, then give them to rob.  Don't get to caught up in what they do, cuz they're just stupid boys.|`|kkM8vFfKaa	It means Rob probably thinks your cute and likes you.

Well first of all, I would say that the best thing you CAN do is talk to him and find out the meaning behind this!

The only way you can find out what it means is if you come right out and ask!...good luck!|`|8bP67U8Taa	lmao!! sorry but the way you said it was too funnny.!! Well anyways. You prob in intermediate and high school and the guy is too immature to ask you.. well wait. guys will always be immature.. tough luck.|`|oTtZekp3aa	It probably either means he is in love with you, or he just enjoys making you miserable. But I am guessing the in love with you option.|`|wp3vYFB9aa	sounds like your friend has a crush on you also.. he sees rob as a way to tell u he likes you.. though that is kinda cheesy. tell him that if rob likes u so much he should stop acting like a little kid.|`|BUe6hAK8aa	wow.<br>  you sound like yerr 10.<br>  he obviously likes yuh.<br>  he sound childish though.<br>  c=|`|ri73Ev0caa	That he likes you.?? duhh XPPP|`|4hz7xbPSaa	rob is obviously teasing u. he dosnt like you babe. not in that way anyway. he sees u as a cool friend who can take a joke. ur good guy friend however is saying that rob likes you to cover up the fact that really he himself is the one who thinks your cute. belive me. i know boys and i know them well. theyve done the same thing to me.alot. so tell ur guy friend that you know how he feels and if u feel the same way tell him if you dont just let him down gently. as for rob dont take him to seriously! its better they make fun of you for being good looking and having a good personality than if they made fun of you in a mean way! theyre boys and boys will be boys! ?|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	how old r u? he loves u
kvCdRzzBaa	well it sounds like your young, which these things can be a really big deal sometimes, just next time make sure you smell good and you wont be so embarrassed. and you never know he might even end up really liking how you smell. good luck, with time he wont even remember.|`|85YtzzKraa	Just laugh it off!

dJwAa1Mzaa	I was exactly the same when I was 15 then I started working at aged 16 in an office & found the process of meeting & talking to new people excruciatingly difficult.<br>  <br>  Practise really does make perfect when it comes to making conversation & being able to relax around people. Make a point of listening when other people start conversations around you as this is a good way of learning new ways to make conversation & can inspire you into thinking up some of your own. When you around people, do you best to avoid thinking negative thoughts about yourself as this only lowers your confidence & makes you quieter as you are too busy thinking rather than joining in. Pay attention to conversations going on as a good way of starting a conversation is to ask somebody a question as it's when they are answering that you begin to relax as the spotlight is on them rather than you. Tips for subjects to start conversations about depends on the kind of people you are talking to but things you have in common is usually a good one such as school classes etc & another trick is to if you have an opinion or something good to say already in your mind then ask somebody a question to steer the conversation towards your prepared comment. <br>  <br>  It was listening to a conversation around me one day which led to the best bit of advice I've ever heard which is to learn to laugh at yourself. It's taking yourself too seriously which can also have an affect on your confidence. I find a great conversation starter is to tell somebody my most recent bimbo incident which makes both me & other person laugh while relaxing at the same time.|`|OugZL6mUaa	sweet name, my name is emily too. lol. okee dokee. just talk about normal stuff. when you hear kids talking about their opinions, join in and be like oh yeah me too. or just ask simple questions, start off by just asking questions about school. like whats the hw for today? and when they answer you could just be like ugh. i hate that class and for all you kno it cold spark a convo. or talk to people with your friends, it gives you more confidence and you won't feel stupid. also, all the pressure isn't on you to start a convo or think of something to say. it won't come fast, but just start off slow. good luck =D|`|B6432rj6aa	Yeah, i used to be like that.

It might be because of bullying with me, or maybe just a tough childhood. There arn't really any tips you just have to relax, and i have no idea how to do it. My voice goes all dry and i get all scared, i never talk and its awful! I'm like the quiet girl (me and my twin) its horrible! Where going to college soon so hopefully will make a new start, let me know how it goes for you. :P|`|McCcU367aa	well, your right to be keeping a distant between people and you as you cannot be comfortable with new people. My advice is to still keep a guard up against people but don't make it bate, act comfortable but keep in mind your keeping a guard against them. Try imagining like your talking with any old friend. Gradually, as you get closer with people you will be able to realise if you could keep a friendship with them or not. If you also know you blush when you are talking to people its mainly because your thinking 'oh my god, i'm blushing'. hope this helps, as it did with me :)
BO28Mn8haa	i think they are just assuming he will have more testosterone. i think you should base your thoughts on whether or not he seems like that kind of person. considering he's your fiance i think you should know him pretty well. congratulations to your big balls big penis fiance lol|`|asxqampCaa	About as much as women with droopy labia (or a moose knuckle or a camel toe or whatever you want to call it) cheat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Specious, spurious, asinine idea.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	that like sayin if i wear Christian Godly underwear on my head will it stop me from having evil thoughts|`|tbJraueLaa	what scale did you use to know if they are gigantic?|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	I think that he should be concerned that you are on here asking this question.  if he is going to cheat he is going to cheat, no matter what size he is.  if you are acting like this, you might drive him to cheat.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	LOL I think you're okay hon..  Guys who are immature with no morals cheat more than their physical makeup.|`|ZEitfScGaa	The ability for a man to cheat is in their brain, not their sack.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	why are you so paranoid?

We may be biologically closely related to the species but we have more intelligence and shall I say common sense, than they do.  Men with larger testicles are no more likely to cheat than any other.  Also, articles in Cosmo are mostly bs, I wouldn't use it as a guide to life or anything.  Think about it, it's like saying 'Are women with larger breasts more likely to cheat?'...it's a big silly. You shouldn't be concerned!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	That is a load of BS. I can smell it and it stinks. Men have a choice as to cheat or not. It has to do with the person, and not what is attatched to them. If you think your boyfriend is going to cheat, then dump him because he deserves a trusting girlfriend.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	No, but in your fiance case it might be true... :)
E7TkNO00aa	Hi. Send her to preschool. She will learn so much and have lots of fun. What a sweet angel for wanting to go to school already. You have a little genius who is growing up fast. Good luck.|`|6Pckjqlsaa	pre school|`|7K2HVodhaa	Ok.|`|Rf9vw4fjaa	preschool<br>  duh|`|Lpc2aAzRaa	preschool all the way|`|SdDvbPf0aa	send her to pre-k
vj2pWs9Maa	The only circumstances I would be upset about porn was if the guy was choosing that over me, or if the porn was sick, disturbing and illegal.  Sounds like you're taking care of things yourself seeing as though you haven't slept together in 6 months.  Maybe don't do it while she's around.  I know some women feel insecure about it (because they feel that their men want to sleep with the porn stars etc).  Just assure her you love her and you find her attractive.  She might have low self esteem, especially if she's been sick and unable to be intimate with you.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	It is a feeling on insecurity.  Like you said she have been sick for 6 months and probably not feeling and looking are best, so her feeling of being insecure is understandable.  I think you should spend more time tell her you love her and making her feel the only woman in your life, her place is secured...  I am sure once she feels that way, she will ease up on you.  Good luck|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Of course she is mad! Porn is disrespectful and wrong when you are in a relationship!  And she is probably feeling VERY bad and she probably wants to have sex too but she cant.  You need to find a mututal ground...you dont NEED porn, you just need the orgasm.  Find other ways to stimulate yourself to get off.  Other ways that wont make her feel bad.  Good luck, i hope things get betetr for the two of you.|`|buHzPMHZaa	You probably should have been more honest with her, but now that the cat's out of the bag, all you can do is make the best of the situation. Be honest with her and make sure she understands that it's just a visual stimulus, and not something deeper.|`|KWYOetbiaa	wow Stephanie, you make me sick! you think that porn is ok?<br>  i'm a guy and of course i look at porn, however I know that porn is not ok, porn is a sin, porn can cause damages to one's brain, porn is not ok if you have a partner.<br>  <br>  i guess stephanie is one of those lesbian girls who think threesomes are ok and who think that having premarital sex is cool. Man, I beg God to keep me away from meeting girls like stephanie.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	I take it she is the kind of sick where she can't (not won't) satisfy your sexual needs. (IE. - life and death sick)  For that I am very sorry to hear that she is so ill.  What you need to do is talk to her when she is at her strongest and most relaxed.  Tell her your needs and ask for suggestions.|`|AA10818265	If you wife can't engage in any sexual activity whatsoever, porn is the best option for you. It would be worst if you turned to a hooker or a chic on the side - porn is innocent in your case. Yes she may be sick but you are not dead and you still have urges.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	she is sick as in dying?  and that's why you haven't had sex in 6 months? Because if that's the case, put the porn away and honor your dying wife's wishes. porn will be there later|`|ZEitfScGaa	Just tell her you need to get off every now and then since she can't help you do it. Would she rather you watch porn to help you get off, or go out and find someone else?|`|1epjqrflaa	Ya, tell your wife to stop being so insecure  and lay off. Your a man not a child and there is nothing wrong with a little porn now and then. What does she expect from you???!!!|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Depends on how often your watching it. Maybe you should be a lil discreat about it. If shes sick be a lil more sensitive dude..:)|`|oauYuhvDaa	And she should be upset.  The only woman you should lust after is your wife...period.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	My hubby used to look at porn too.  Let me ask you this question:  Would you like to come home and see your wife comparing you to a lot of men naked?  Think about it?  Do you want to see her looking at all these really sexy guys with nothing on?  She can you know.. Do you want to be compared to them?  To your wife you are cheating on her with your eyes.<br>  She wants to feel that she is the most attractive woman you will ever want.<br>  Don't you want to feel that she things you are the most attractive guy she would ever want?  Maybe she feels she does not want to go to bed with you if she is compared to another woman.  Maybe you do not tell her she is pretty enough and maybe she is not sure of her own looks.  Women are bad about thinking they are not attractive enough and when their husband is looking at all these sexy gals with nothing on they do not want to be compared to them.|`|zs3AThq9aa	It is proven it can be addictive. And if you are doing it in front of her it is very disrespectful. If you are going crazy, wait until she goes to sleep or go to the bathroom and use your hand. She can not help being sick, so don't try to make her feel worse than she already does. Don't you think she wishes it hadn't been 6 months also?|`|mhvoPAOCaa	tell her to look at it with you!! Might spice it up a bit..if shes not the type for porn, ease her into it...then she can provide u with a hand job  or something, so she at least feels involved and not betrayed.|`|0dlSudzBaa	did u every think its because she feels inicure like ur watching porn because she isnt satifiing you. make her feel wanted still and maybe ask her to watch it with you so she can see why and it may bring a spark back into the relatinship x|`|nnXQuq6vaa	My suggestion get porn that you both can look at. She is insecure so take care of it by not excluding her. If you need to j*** o** tell her what you want her to do to you.|`|wnOAxQcoaa	duh|`|4nSN1kPIaa	sicko|`|jdRKZe18aa	she has every right to be mad - I would too.  Can she HELP being sick? Did you just marry her for the SEX?  Doesn't your relationship go deeper than your poor lack of personal gratification & needs?  Come on - grow up, get a life and show some grown up self control and compassion, concern, unselfishness.  LOOKING at other women on the internet is just a selfish unhealthy supposed safe way to STILL be unfaithful in a marriage as far as I'm concerned....<br>  <br>  What if she was even sicker, or dying, or disabled in an accident?  Is there not SOME THINGS that should be MORE important than your personal sex drive???   Sorry... no offense but I say Shame on you!|`|lyWSufFBaa	Stop getting caught.  If you know she doesn't like it don't make it so obvious.  You are a grown man with needs and porn is just visual simulation but if your wife is sick then be more sensitive to her situation.  You have to realize she isn't getting any either.  I hope your wife gets better. <br>  <br>  To the person that said porn is damaging to the brain, is that a scientific fact? LOL. Nowadays you can watch a movie with just as much sex and nudity.  Is that damaging to the brain?
CkN4pgpCaa	I think you should still send the cards out.  The people that will send them back will be appreciative that you included a simple way for them to RSVP.  If they have to use their own stamps, you probably won't get very many.  You don't want to make it more difficult for the people that will respond to, or you'll get even less of a response.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry that such a large percentage don't RSVP.  I'm always amazed by people that show up at weddings that didn't do that.  You'd think they'd be embarrassed!  How hard is it to write your name, check yes or no, and stick the card in the mailbox?|`|8ygky5g4aa	If you don't send response cards, how will you determine how many guests you will have?  The fact is some people don't understand that they need to send the response card back.  Those same people will also not send a handwritten note or call or anything else to let you know they are coming.  That is the chance you take when inviting guests to any event.<br>  <br>  Send the response cards, most will reply.  Those who don't you will need to call.  If you decide to not send the cards then you will probably need to call all your guests because your caterer will need a final count prior to your wedding.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UPSys1POaa	What I did was send the response cards with everyone's name preprinted on it, and a checkbox under 'attending' or 'regrets.' I didn't want people writing names down that weren't invited just because they felt like bringing somebody.<br>  <br>  I know that listing names on response cards is on the etiquette fence, but I said I did it because I didn't want to worry about reading messy handwriting. ;)<br>  <br>  Sending response cards is NOT offensive at all. If you don't send them, you'll have even less people responding. Just suck up the cost as a necessary expense. It's what we all have to do.<br>  <br>  If you like, you could say "RSVP to 538-673-8726 by [date]." although some find this a bit rude.|`|gK0vcdnDaa	I did an all-inclusive response card and info card.  We are doing our RSVPs by phone and e-mail.  We save on postage and we may still get the hand-written response along with the phone calls and the website/e-mail responses.  I can't wait!  <br>  <br>  Also included on my "response" card was the ceremony address (there wasn't room on the invitation) the Reception information and address, our personalized webpage and the information on how to rsvp...  but I don't think I put the date on it...  oops...  <br>  <br>  oh well I think I got them in the mail today, too late to fix now.  I'm not too worried about it I haven’t' even sent the invites yet and I've gotten a 1/4 of the people who've already told me their decision.  And if worst comes to worst its only about 100 families to call (well 70 with the ones already out of the way).<br>  <br>  I don’t think that its against Miss Manners to have or to not have a response card.  If it were me I would leave the response cards out of the invitations to the people who I know will RSVP the traditional way without being prompted, and I’d put them in the rest – especially for people under the age of 25, I honestly don’t think that most people under the age of 30 know how to RSVP in the proper manner, but maybe that’s just my friends :)  Maybe include an e-mail or website for the technology friendly.  Whatever works for you, you'll probably still have a few wild ones to call - but we all do...<br>  <br>  Congrats and Good Luck!<br>  -Elle|`|FgjI26QNaa	I think it would depend on what type of wedding you are planning, served food, etc.  In a "traditional" wedding, I would say yes, send the RSVP.<br>  Do you believe that you a fair amount of people will not bother like with your family member's wedding?  I would do it proper and if for no other reason to show guests how important your wedding is to you. I do think that guests should at least have the courtesy of Responding to your invitation.|`|B2cvkTp7aa	Yes, include them. It makes YOU look tacky if you don't.<br>  <br>  Also, include stamped and addressed return envelopes for them, so that all they have to do is put yes or no, seal the envelope, and send it.<br>  <br>  If someone doesn't RSVP they have no class. It's a wedding, not a backyard picnic.|`|busvRidhaa	It all depends on if the wedding correspondence is going to follow traditional format or if you include modern methods of communication such as an email save the date or Evite for the engagement party. Traditional etiquette would say that you should include an rsvp. It's something lovely to open and received back in the mail! (I still have all of my rsvp cards from my wedding.) I think you can give your guests the benefit of the doubt and trust that they will send them back in a timely fashion. Otherwise, how on earth do you expect them to handwrite an rsvp on their own? It will a nightmare when you try to figure out the seating and the guest count for the caterer if you don't have a good idea of who is attending and who is not. Good luck!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you are having any type of catering where you need a headcount (that includes the most basic cake and punch reception), you must include rsvps of some type.<br>  <br>  If someone doesn't send in their reply card, it is your job after the rsvp deadline to call around to see if they are coming or not.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Our Response card had a place for a "note" at the bottom.  It was great being able to read the little bits that everyone wrote! :)
Cb0l4QvKaa	honestly ur screwed|`|r3xuKqakaa	eventually , if he sees you in person he'll know its not you .<br>  you're going to have to tell him sooner or later . and show a real picture of you . if he's into you too , he won't care about his looks .|`|qy07K2k5aa	I don't think it's a good idea to meet people that you know through the internet. They seldom are what you expect them to be.|`|vtafeEIJaa	god will surely forgive you|`|AA11309717	you need to be honest now and stop lying. Lying undercuts any possibility of a relationship between the 2 of you working. Also understand that you can be anybody you want to be when you are behind a computer.

That is SO cute!!! Be like "Would you hate me if i was unnatractive?" and see what he says.

Why would you date a guy over the internet anyways? You're basically going out with a computer. To answer your question, maybe you could play it off as:<br>  <br>  a) A mistake. You sent the wrong picture.<br>  <br>  b) Jokingly. You say you weren't sure if he'd like you so you sent someone else's, but laugh throughout. Make it sound like one big joke.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think this is irreparable.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|sDqJIT5Paa	how do you know this guy is real.. he could be a creeper. there are alot of those on the interent!!  also you need to tell him that at first you did not send him real pictures.  also how do you know that you love him!! you have only talked through the internet!|`|vh550lYJaa	okay hunny its going ti be ok this is what i would do i would meet him and say i Lied bc so and so and i didnt think u would like me and if he loves you and its ment to be he will still love UUUUUUUUUU|`|45GlDKO3aa	just say " i made a huge mistake" and say just listen for a sec...and say those pics arnt me just say i think im not attractive so i didnt send u a real pic.....and say well u can like me or not but i really like u....|`|CdUvu8D8aa	if he loves you then he wont care what you look like as long as your not saquash if you are then feel horrible.. but he shouldnt care if he loves you becuase like you said he loves YOU not the image...|`|n2leN4ewaa	give me the pictures of you and I'll pretend like I'm someone else to see what he thinks! you're not horrible..

I would absolutely tell him the truth before you meet him.  I mean, it's not like you can hide it when you meet him.  I would just explain that you were having fun on the internet, but when things got serious, you were afraid he wouldn't like you.  If he likes you, this is fairly easy to forgive.  I don't care what anyone says on this post, physical atraction is half the battle, so you two really don't love eachother until he sees your pic/you in person.  Bite the bullet at least you will know.|`|lGoVB6haaa	If you really do love him, then you'll have to tell him the truth; and the sooner, the better. When you tell him the truth, he probably will feel hurt and probably upset, but if he truly loves you then he will be able to overcome those feelings and realize that he wants to - needs to - be with you. Tell him why you lied to him in the first place, and make sure he understands. The assure him that you love him, so you'll never lie to him again (and I'm sure you won't. [=). Things like this can be forgiven, trust me. And if your love is pure enough, then things will eventually work out for the two of you. I know it may seem impossible to be able to tell him now, but you will feel much more free with him once the truth is let out. And remember, just because you may not think you're attractive, that doesn't mean he won't!<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|IXltpoJkaa	tell him the truth and act like you are really sad for lying|`|Phnag9h0aa	when a girl wants to really be with a guy she wants to tell him the truth but will maybe think, he might not like me! if he has an idea because of the pictures of who you are and its not true, you should tell him the truth and say sorry. send him pictures of the real you and explain why you did it. he will understand!|`|nbm1RDoZaa	Does he like you because of the way you look?|`|CoEGQxN6aa	Never date anyone from the internet.  Your taking a huge risk.  Most people are not who they are when you can not see them face to face.  I would advise caution...learn a lesson about being truthful...and move on.  I love you are just words anyone can say them...it has no real meaning.  Lust is for the first 3 months after that comes bonding which then leads to love.  Don't rush into anything...love yourself enough to move on.  You don't know anything about this person...he might hurt you.|`|4IhXjUpFaa	tell him b4 it is to late<br>  tell him you sent him the wrong pictures..<br>  have you seen his pics?
yTRY5F0Qaa	I wouldn't judge you at all.  Actually in the summertime I bring my 4 year old with me to hang brochures on my neighbors doors.  I personally have 3 children and you have to do what you have to do which would accomodate your family.<br>  <br>  As a stated I believe in your other question, when you join Avon it is your business so you do what you choose to do with it as you please.<br>  <br>  Personally for me it has been worth while. I am able to make $250 every 2 weeks in addition to my full time income.<br>  <br>  Not sure if you are aware but now you can sign up to become a representative online now. Plus, with all the support that is available out there you should be able to make a great income. <br>  <br>  If you do happen to be interested and are ready to get started just click my profile for online application website information.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped answer your question|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Personally, I wouldn't see a problem with that. Whatever works.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I would think you are a strong mother , but also I might be a bit annoyed with the kids being present. Reason I say this, is because with Avon you have to go into the persons home. What if your kids are crying, and or getting into things at the persons home? That could hurt business for you. <br>  <br>  Are there any gyms in your local area? I ask because there is one here in my town, and they have a day care in the gym. Alot of mothers get jobs there because you can take your kid there while you work. Maybe find something like that, so that if you have your kids there it won't be any different than the kids that are there for members using the gym.<br>  <br>  <br>  best wishes|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	I can understand your situation about not leaving the children in daycare because of the cost.<br>  <br>  The only drawback I can see is that children that young aren't known for being "cooperative" when you want them to be.  You're trying to impress a new client and the children are screaming because they are bored, tired, hungry or just being kids.<br>  <br>  Until you get some regular clients established, maybe the children could stay with a babysitter (not daycare) now and then, so you can give the new customer your undivided attention.  When you deliver the Avon back to the customers, then bring the children along on the deliveries.  I know how Avon works where I live:  get your foot in the door and after that just throw a new order book at the folks now and then.<br>  <br>  As the clients get to know you, they won't mind your children.Better to start off without them, though.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think your children are too young and too demanding at these ages to allow your potential clients to concentrate on what you are selling them and you will not make sales this way.<br>  <br>  If you can do most of your business by magazine dropoff, maybe come and meet them one time and ask them to call in for a demo or to place an order, you could do it.  <br>  <br>  For what it is worth, the hardest employment currently is door to door sales.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I wouldn't mind but I was an Avon lady and quit because I made very little money.  Besides, there are Avon stores in lots of malls, and many women aren't home during the day anymore so you would have to go at night.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Do whatever you need to do to support yourself..best wishes to you|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	ask yourself some questions...<br>  what kind of an image does this project to my potential customers?<br>  If i get invited in for a possible sale, who is going to watch the kids? will the customer allow me to bring them into their house?<br>  <br>  My personal advice would be to leave the kids with someone you trust..<br>  as a prospective customer i would be a little reluctant to buy from a door to door sales person who is taking their kids with them.  I would hav e to ask some personal questions, which you may not want to answer, before I would feel comfortable buying from you.|`|lJPKjVqIaa	There are lots of welfare programs like housing assistance (where your rent will be approx 30% of your income), daycare assistance where your co-pay will be about $60/mo, food stamps. These things are easy to get you just fill out a few simple forms and they verify your income. This will help you until you get back on your feet. Ask your states wefare program what they can do for you. But as far as taking your kids door to door with you I would not advise it.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	If you'd go for a 1 hour walk with the kids and use that opportunity to drop by people's house I'd think it's fine.............If you spend your entire day dragging these kids along, in all kinds of weather, it would upset me.<br>  <br>  veryitalianguy:<br>  What's your problem!

xuiSfzgraa	I am doing an outside wedding/reception at my house.  It is costing aprox. 8,000.  That is covering everything from my dress, catering for 250 people decorations, photographer, dj, drinks, dance floor, favors, ect...And a large enough tent to fit the whole reception under.|`|RC6Dn6zoaa	Ill be married soon and i expect roughly about 100 guest, we calculated an outdoor wedding w/ tables, chairs, DJ equipment, tent, dancefloor ,decor and we recieved an estimate about 2500.00 just for furniture, so we decided with that amount we could just do a hotel/banquet dinner dance kind of thing. less stressful..<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats! (whomever is jumping the broom)|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	depends on where you're located. But for my venue it was an extra $500 to have the ceremony outside and it was no additional cost to have the cocktail hour outside. Rest of the reception was inside.|`|q3ulEHYAaa	I myself  always wanted an outdoor wedding I started to plan  and found out it's cheaper to get a banquet hall.  Plus less stress wondering what the weather will be. good luck|`|EzxeHsLHaa	For how many people? Is food involved? Is that your only venue? Is it in a park, or outside of a restaurant?<br>  <br>  If you just have a ceremony outside, it doesn't have to cost anything. If you want to have food, I would say you can have caterers get you a buffet for as cheap as 20 Dollars a person (probably without drinks), but there is no limit upwards.|`|AA11024148	mine was FREE.<br>  i come from a huge family and i knew i didn't want to spend a fortune on a wedding (only 1 day) when the idea behind being married is (to us) about the rest of our lives together.<br>  <br>  we did it outside at the beach (because my family had already planned a 'family vacation' at a resort). my husband and i had our house and the rest of my family had another house rented. his family stayed at a hotel next door to the resort. we did a potluck lunch for the reception. every family made one dish and there was more than enough to feed everyone (+ a few extras at the beach).<br>  <br>  now my nieces and nephews want a family vacation every year:)

Em5PSrUgaa	Oh honey, I have been there...trust me. I had what I believed at that time were friends for life. When something was important to one of them, I was completely there, but when it was my turn, I got EXACTLY the same responses that you did, "I don't/didn't know what to say" from one, or a funny, (but not the time for it), wise crack from the other one. I eventually confronted one of my friends and explained to her how never knowing what to say in my times of need weren't cutting it anymore. She tried to change, but overtime her own worries and in my opinion selfishness won out in the end. All problems needed to be hers or about her, there was no room for anyone else's. The other "friend" , the one who made witty jokes, tried to check in with me once she realized that our friendships were falling apart, but it was too late. I'd had it with always holding their hands and getting...again...my opinion, excuses from them. Still, I think that you should try telling your friends how you feel and give them a chance to correct it. Or you can keep them as your friends, but not look to them as the people to come to whenever you need to talk about something serious in your life. Like my former friends, some people just don't have it in them to be aware or sensitive to anyone else's problems but their own.|`|Ne9fbdLdaa	Tell them straight up. That you want to talk serious & If they still do that, then there not TRUEEE friends.<br>  (: <br>  Hope this help.

Z2xETWhbaa	You can't make someone love you and you can't make them treat you better.  If he doesn't treat you the way you want to be treated you  first need to speak with him about it.  If that doesn't work and your still not happy you need to end it.  I am 28 and married for almost 9 years.  The best advice I can give you is that whatever he does or doesn't do now he won't do later.  Meaning that if there is something about him that drives you nuts and you think that after your married it will change think again.  It won't.  Relationships take a lot of work and if your not happy you need to move onto the next flower.|`|hyRj4eIjaa	tell hm that u wanna feel special. lol. yeah no do anything but that! lol|`|M63kq3AYaa	You don't, <br>  Either he will or he won't and chances are he won't.

Po4Lljjwaa	Honestly, it sounds like you're too young to get married.  Haha!  Just kidding!  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I'm engaged and some people see my ring and think it's neccessary to tell me that I look too young to be engaged.  "You don't know what you want yet."  "You're just a kid."  Like I'm still in 6th grade, crushing on my first boy!  Jeez!  I just tell them (with a smile on my face), "You're not the first person to tell me that - but if I see you down the road in fifty years, me and my husband will make you eat your words."  Good luck with everything and CONGRATULATIONS!!!  ?|`|0F8hauikaa	Some people just need to express their (unsolicited) opinions about everything. You could try just smiling and say something like, "Thanks, I'll take that into consideration." and if you like add, "but we'll probably just do it our way." Sometimes the easiest way to get rid of them is to agree (even though you don't). Congratulations and good luck to you.|`|zNjACkxpaa	hollyy I think your user name says it all. Being a teen wife is hard being a military wife is hard <br>  <br>  being a teen military wife who may end up in a strange town and state while your husband is deployed in a foreign country is going to be REALLY Hard<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is hard to hear the truth and the truth hurts.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	simply say <br>  "i'm sorry you feel that way"<br>  and walk away sweetie.  don't give them a chance to say anything else.  sadly people start flapping their gums long before their brains are in gear.<br>  congrats to you and happy happy wedding!|`|p9QglBpyaa	Just so you know, all brides go through this. What you have to remember is that people want to be a part of it and want to give you (what they consider to be) good advice. All you can do is smile and say thanks, my fiance & I are really looking forward planning the wedding together and starting our lives together. That covers everything - that you don't need/want advice about the wedding or your marriage, but in a nice & discreet way.|`|crxbob5jaa	"I appreciate your advice. Thank you!" <br>  <br>  Then do what you want to do.<br>  <br>  OR....<br>  <br>  use the one word my son uses all the time and I can't ever figure out if he's happy about I'm saying, or totally ignoring me  ;-)  <br>  <br>  With a half question, just say "Really?" Nothing else is needed.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Just smile and say "I'll think about it", change the subject and do what you want.  You will not only have this on your wedding day but every day thereafter.  Grin and bear it baby!|`|vCZuh3oDaa	"How kind of you to take an interest, but we're very confident that we'll be able to properly plan for our wedding."|`|sLLgERQWaa	Try a long, cold stare, then change the subject.....that speaks volumes.|`|Ev3fFui4aa	At least they're telling you now - loads of my friends waited till afterwards, and even then have never said it to my face! :)<br>  <br>  In all honesty, if they're friends that matter, sit down with them and ask them what their concerns are.  Don't feel you have to justify yourself, but if you can put their minds at rest that you are a mature adult making a mature choice, your problem will be solved, so it is worth it, at least a little.<br>  <br>  If they are not good friends, just don't invite them.<br>  <br>  A good friend of mine was told by three busybodies, that she was making a mistake - she still invited them on the day!  I would never have spoken to them again, but because their motives were obviously single-person jealousy, and regret for losing a good drinking buddy. Pathetic.<br>  <br>  I made a rule for our day, that we had NO ONE there we didn't want, and we weren't bothered who we offended, as it was our day.  I even uninvited one cousin who started stirring up trouble because her daughter wasn't a bridesmaid.<br>  <br>  We also omitted two of my husbands work colleagues, one of whom chose 3 weeks before our wedding to express her concerns that he was marrying a religious person.  I'm glad he only told me after we'd left the pub tat evening!  I pointed out to him, if she was truly concerned for her 'good friend' she'd have spoken to him a year earlier when he got engaged, not 3wks before the big day!<br>  <br>  Summarily, the only persons opinions that count are yours and your fiances, and your families - if they support you, and you prove your love is forever over time, friends will come around, or go off and be negative to someone else - don't let them ruin your happiness!|`|F8iYNurEaa	Everyone has an opinion when it comes to someone else's wedding and it is soooooo annoying. I am sick of people thinking it is fine to criticise other people's ideas because that isn't the way they did it at their own wedding, or giving you really crap advice that can't be incorporated into the wedding! I was told that they best thing to do for my wedding to help us save money would be to have a pig roast and then ask everyone to bring an item of food with them!!!!!!! Uh no! What stupid stupid advice. I am getting married, not having a BBQ in my back garden. Just show disinterest everytime anyone gives you advice. If you dismiss their ideas then they might get the message!|`|QmG2v1quaa	The only "best" way to show them that you don't care what they think is go through with your marriage the way and time that you want too. Who cares what they say, honestly. People will tell you things about your wedding you don't want to hear your whole life, whether you be getting married at 18 or 30. I will be 22 when I get married, yeah I'll be on the younger side, but I will have a degree and will have a stable career. I don't see what the big deal is, but people are still telling me to wait. I just ignore them. I will prove them wrong. I will be happy and married with a great career and a great life. I don't need thier approval to do that!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on your engagement!!|`|busvRidhaa	Congratulations! This should be an exciting time for your and your fiancee. Enjoy and keep smiling. <br>  <br>  In terms of your friends and family, don't ask for an opinion unless you are prepared to deal with their answer. If there is something that you are totally confident about, you won't mind if people express doubt on your behalf. You can kindly change the subject asap and if they have any manners at all, they will pick up on your cue and let it go.Happiness is the best revenge!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I really don't get what the problem is with everyone telling others to wait until they're in their mid to late 20s to get married.  It should be everyone's personal choice as far as what age they get married, and no one besides the parents should really be able to give an opinion.  I got engaged and married at 17, and everyone was shocked!  They were like"what about college?"  And I had never really planned to go to college.  I finished high school at 16, so that wasn't a problem, but everyone hit the roof when they found out I wasn't planning on going to college.  Anyway, just tell people that  you're happy and you're ready to get married.  Hopefully that'll help, at least until the next time they see you.  :)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	dish it out as a backhanded compliment.  like "we're happy that youve taken an interest in our wedding plans, but we're sure we have it under control on our own.  thank you anyway"  <br>  <br>  that way you get your point across and tell them that you dont appreciate their negitivity without coming off like a ***** (but in this case if you wanted to be, i dont see why it would be an issue0
dzyJw0cvaa	He IS ripping your heart out!  When you are married you are a team and he is not being a team mate for you.  I think you really need to soul search and find out if this is the right relationshiop for you to be in.  there is no excuse for him to be treating you this way and you can be much happier with someone who actually wants to be with you and your daughter.  you are not being unreasonable.  this is not the stone age anymore.  there is no such thing as mans work and womens work.  We are all equal and when married, we should share the same burden.  He is being a bad father, a bad husband, and a bad person!  Talk to him about this. Tell him he is being unfair and tell him you want to go to counseling.  if he doesnt want to go, it means he doesnt want to work on the relationship, because your relationship is VERY damaged right now.  then you know how he really feels.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you have to be going through this...i dont know why some people think they can treat the ones that love them like SH**.  If i could be blunt, i would say move on and leave him behind.  He is probably cheating on you anyway, there is NO reason he should want to live his life seperately from you and your children.  You all deserve better.  Oh, and just because he lives with his mum doesnt mean he isnt cheating.  My ex husband was sleeping with numerous women and his mom knew and defended him every time.  And he was the nicest guy!  i was blown away.  All the signs point to affiar.  I know, i have been there.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Completely aside from your question, which I will get to in a second, you are aware that he is seeing someone else where he lives now, aren't you?  Okay, good.<br>  <br>  Secondly, he sounds like a complete jackass, and I wouldn't ask him to attend anymore of your daughter's functions.  It is clear that he doesn't see her as a priority, or you either for that matter.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Living like this is not a marriage.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	My life Changed when i lost my daughter to Leaukimia. Befoore that i was just like your husbane.<br>  Now i demoted myself on good wages manager to a position less paying just so i can spend more time with my wife and children and the good thing is i wish i realized this long before<br>  I have 4 kids and love them very much my marriage is much better<br>  and i will never ever get caught up in money and work like that again.<br>  Jobs are always there and they come and go<br>  But Family is priceless once there gone they are gone for good<br>  He needs to realize this <br>  He married you and had children for a reason<br>  he needs to come doewn to eath to truely realize what he is missing <br>  i hope it doesnt take a major loss like me to make him realize how important his family is|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Your not being unreasonable wanting to share this school event with your husband. It's parents night not mom's night. So he should have to go as well. Sounds like he's a little insensitive saying that it's not his job. Sounds to me like he's distancing himself from the family for a reason. It's best to get to the bottom of what's really going on.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	I think you know the answer to this, your not being unreasonable he is.  To be honest my hubby's work takes him away from home all over the world, but he's moved heaven and earth on occasions to be here for certain things.  He's used a pathetic excuse for not coming to HIS and your daughters parents evening, he's a discrace.  If I were you I'd have divorced him long ago.|`|krThCHxyaa	You should try Marriage counseling, and whatever you do, don't think that divorce is the only solution to your marriage problems.|`|n7noPV7Aaa	His kids should come before his job. I'm sorry but I would think he has another life where his job is. He doesn't want you there and he is only home once a week. Think about it.|`|MG1IVmvIaa	I think you might want to see if he has someone in the other town, to many red flags, come up with what you are saying.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	I hate to be the one to tell you this..but it sounds like he is living a double life (aka affair).  I mean I don't know him and I may be way off but from what you have said I'm thinking what he is a selfish bastard who has no regard to any ones feelings but his own.  I'm sorry to put it so bluntly but I can't believe how just down right mean he is being.  You mentioned you are a Dr.  Find out what is really going on.  Has he ever gave you a reason to think he is being unfaithful?  <br>  No one deserves to be married to someone that makes them feel bad.  Life is too short.  <br>  Apparently you two have had problems in the past so your marriage hasn't been a bed of roses anyhow.  Please just keep that in mind..no one deserves to hurt or be unhappy in a marriage.  I hope I don't sound like I condone divorces, I'm just saying he is looking out for his best interest, why don't you?|`|D33VRTz8aa	You need to be honest with him and tell him face to face the day he comes home. That he needs get his act together else this way it can effect your children's future too.<br>  <br>  Also if his brother and mom can stay with him where he works why can't you? This is something to think about too. You will have to get him to open up to you. <br>  <br>  Tell him that you are not paranoid you are normal human being, thinking about the future of your family and your and his future as husband and wife. This way both your relationship may not last long.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	He needs help, you need to let him know that you do not like this treatment and that he better get his act together or things will get worse.  It is hard when there is distance in a relationship. I would tell him that you are not worried about the finances and are ready to move out to be with him.  You guys are both doctors you can find a job where he is. The medical field is one area where there will always be jobs  Right now you both need to work on making this relationship work and make it not about money.|`|Ev3fFui4aa	He is her father, he should make the effort to be there, but it says far more about him as a parent than him as a husband.<br>  <br>  The two things are almost separate.<br>  <br>  Your marriage is a sham - I agree his 'single' life with his GP practice seems a little odd and suspicious, especially that he doesn't want you to relocate.<br>  <br>  I would go alone, and then sit him down later and say that it wasn't about you, but about your (shared) daughter.  That you have enough respect for yourself to walk away from your non-existent marriage, but that he still has responsibilities towards his child.  I would then concentrate on a new life that doesn't include him.  He doesn't love, or respect you, and you deserve better.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I think it's unreasonable to expect that a man who clearly prefers being single will all of a sudden start acting like a married man just because of a school event. Your husband doesn't want the responsibilities of a husband and father burden him; until this attitude changes, you can pretty much expect more of the same. You know what they say - insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. You keep going back to this man over and over, expecting things to change. Kind of insane, don't you think?|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Sounds like he has the mind of a single man, who has no kids. <br>  Do you think that he's cheating on you?

EZd7nuWBaa	Well the most important thing is to remember that she's seen you before so don't look like you tried to hard. While keeping that in mind wear a little more cologne. (Ask you closest girl friend if it's to much). Wear something a little nicer than normal, and definitely do the necessities, brush your hair, teeth, etc.<br>  For the asking out part start with something simple go on a walk on a nice day and ask her to (insert chosen place here) with you. If the walk isn't practical do it, girls are even more impressed if you do it while she's with her friends but if that's not a possibility either wrap her in a hug and whisper it in her ear. <br>  Hope I helped(:|`|nNYBhelGaa	just start a convo about anythink like your teacher or anything and then just say you know your really cool we should hang out sometime|`|wIN9xHuRaa	Do exactly wat i did <br>  Like talk 2 dem call dey beautiful u know comment them nice things than they like it 3 days later tell them u really like them and u will like to go out with them <br>  And For me it worked but u gootta get 2 know her first|`|ik9UivO8aa	honestly it all goes around guts. you have to muster up the bravery to ask her out. it really doesn't matter if you look good, she will appreciate you being brave enough to ask her out|`|yKhrdGPFaa	best way is to just be yourself  try talking to her and see what she like maybe yall can have something in common and if you do use that to ask her out|`|pssezVkDaa	just be just self and dont act a different way then you normal do in front of her. just be like hey can i have you # so i can call you some time? and tell her you think she's cute when you call her|`|0OaW7CD8aa	u look good enough probably..just make sure u smell good..o and start a conversation with her and all of a sudden say "hey we should hang out"|`|SeaRElMDaa	do what everybody else on this said.

Her parents will hear and she'll be punished. Believe me, it definitely works.<br>  Or maybe, you should sit down with her and explain to her that if she wants to make friends, she can't act like that.

KBh6jKCTaa	well clearly you're not lacking in confidence. shy is fine as long as the guy actually talks. the quiet thing doesn't work b/c who wants a guy you can't talk to? there is a mystery to a shy guy though, and girls love a mystery. so as long as you don't completely shut down, you're fine.|`|piuEx0BJaa	I love shy guys they seem more mysterious haha. but it's kind of a problem cause i'm shy too.<br>  <br>  yeah i agree with the girl above me they are so much cuter than cocky loud guys.|`|AA11303574	shy guys are cute|`|UzmfIaYiaa	ok the boy i like is shy. i hate the fact tht he is shy but i stil like him if tht helps lol. i wish hed get over it tho...i guess im shy around him to tho. wht do guys think about shy girls?|`|2vgbJhlRaa	INTROVERTED! google it and read about it. it might help|`|0PKoq9fdaa	I love shy guys!!!!|`|jLNnwWcpaa	i have a crush on a shy guy, i dont see any problem with shy guys, except, they dont talk that much, and thats a problem cause talking is my second fav. subject. soo yah sometimes when i like someone i talk WAY to much and i think i scare them off, so dont worry girls like all types of men,|`|4JJOQqjvaa	personally...I kinda like it...but at the same time I hate it because they get so boring!

They're so much better than players, have some confidence in yourself. There's a special girl God's picked out for you, she will appreciate your shyness.|`|85YtzzKraa	Maybe that they're cute! Because some guys are to outspoken and it's nice to have someone who's not like that!|`|0dlSudzBaa	i think u should be more open shy guys are god to start with but boring in the end x|`|QxQxVPnraa	I think they are pretty hot because it makes it easier to flirt with them|`|wcuba7UEaa	We think they're adorable :D|`|cb538e4d8411f45b9e2c09441178c232aa	well... i am the same way with guys... so I know how you feel, and I think that shy guys are great and a lot better than those loud obnoxious guys... so good for you!!!<br>   ha ha|`|Jlnlh17Oaa	every girl secretly wants to date a shy guy someday :P
uBssj3Znaa	ask him if he is dating anyone else or if you two are just dating exclusively. <br>  <br>  If you both are just dating exclusively then you two would technically be boyfriend/girlfriend.|`|90489878a471069fbf4b00f475ba85adaa	well, i said to my boyfriend now "just ask me to be your gf" <br>  haha and he was like "okay, will you be my gf?"<br>  <br>  it was funny, but i was so tired of trying to figure out what we were!|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Just straight out ask "Are we bf and gf?, I know it sounds funny but I would like to know if we're exclusive"<br>  <br>  I was dating a guy for a year, we were exclusive but he wouldn't give me the title of gf. Turns out he went back to his ex girlfriend. Was the reason why he kept our relationship abstract.|`|aMGfRum0aa	He seems probably like someone who's a nice guy, but isn't really interested in anything more than dating. If your trying to find Mr. Right, I'd say leave him.|`|0OaW7CD8aa	just put in relationship on ur myspace..jk! just ask if hes dating any1 else...and if not then theres a good chance ur a couple|`|H7evKKdIaa	Be all cute and smile at him when your alone, and just be like, "So, I just wanted to know if you would like to offically be my boyfriend" :). Light hearted, yet straight to the point. See what he says, By the sounds of it he wants to ask you too but might be a little unsure about how to do it (considering your preivious realationship). Wait about a day or two and change your myspace status, even if he doens;t this will let him know that its ok for him to do so as well. Best wishes! <3|`|kvlnADyIaa	Mhm, I sometimes wonder it to. You might just have to be straight up and say. Listen, i know this is silly, but were going out right?  and before he can answer say. I mean i know were dating and all but am i officially your girlfriend? So it should look like this.<br>  <br>  Hey, Listen I know this is a silly question but.. Am I your girlfriend? I mean I know we've been dating but are we like going out now?|`|7HfR6RObaa	you can ask him if you are his girl friend by easily saying to him while you guys are preoccupied <br>  <br>  you can say hey were do we stand or just say something sweet as if your just saying it  like are you my baby or sweet heart and if he says yes then you got your answer or wait till you guys are out in public and they ask you or him how do you guys know each other wait for his response or just say hes my bf|`|ZwJXgCTmaa	Honestly, the best way to get your question out of the way is to ask him where the two of you stand. Its not a silly question because a lot of us girls wonder the same thing. Sometimes, guys are just super hard to read. lol So, I wish you the best!|`|ad2854c8911dd7ce0fd1a3926f235710aa	I think you should ask him what do you have to lose just say hey are we together my friend wants to know.....lol just kidding just ask what tha worst that can happen there always a time when you have to be embarrassed in front of someone you like so y not now|`|8nFATCClaa	Haha. I asked my boyfriend to his face. <br>  "So am I like your girlfriend or something?" :)<br>  Little after a month of pretty much the same thing you are going through. I am 22 and it felt childish but I played it off well and silly. <br>  Boyfriends reaction "Well..duh"|`|aHWmqYY2aa	just say it in a joking way. so then sexy does this mean im your gf then or ya just usin me. it'll be in a jokin way so he'll have a laugh about it. worked for me.|`|8bP67U8Taa	Interesting question, because I wouldn't know how to ask a guy if I was gf either. Let me know when you get an answer. =)|`|OGMJcikIaa	Well honestly, I feel like being open is the best thing in any situation.  So I think if you happen to be talking about future plans and stuff like that it wouldn't hurt to just throw in "we're exclusive, right?" or something to that effect.  If others see you as a couple and say things like "you two are a cute couple" and he doesn't say "oh we're not dating" or anything like that I would say there is a pretty good chance that he's just going to laugh at you and say "well duh, of course we're dating" when you bring it up.  Another way you could say it would be like, "so I was updating my facebook page the other day and I wasn't sure if I should make us "facebook Official" yet or not...what do you think? can our relationship handle it?!" and just make it like a joke so he doesn't feel like you're super serious about the whole thing.  That's how I would handle the situation myself.  Hope this helps!

MINE DOESNT :(|`|TyZYlRDRaa	i guess its ok to tell him cuz u picked it not him.  if he picked it, i would keep my mouth shut and fake that i really like it|`|ypy1ikVDaa	I would not tell him-because it was a gift and he was trying to be sweet and remember exactly what you wanted. I would just keep quiet and not hurt his feelings.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	communication is the most important part of your relationship.  best to tell him you made a mistake and return it.|`|gsem4EnYaa	wow, thats kind of mean|`|SmFcDx4waa	how much was it...considering it is jewelry im assuming it wasn't cheap....that being the case I'd tell him. Explain that it was super thoughtful of him to remember that you had said you liked it, but now that you see it for real it is too small/not as cool as you thought etc...He should have no problem taking it back and letting you pick something you will want to wear...
lUty60Pxaa	if you don't think he likes you, you probably shouldn't|`|pCg5JWqPaa	Just call.|`|Un9CElCaaa	you should call him but personally i think the guy should be the one to call first|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	it depends...did he give you his number? Cus if he did, then you should text definitely call him and just be like "we should totally hang out some time! haha" make sure you kind of "giggle"(for lack of a better word) to keep the conversation light. Don't mention going out, just say we should hang out some time. It also depends on if you guys talk at all in school/work or whatever. If you don't talk too much, don't call him. Text him.|`|SgrjTkwdaa	Why would you call him if you don't think he likes you?<br>  <br>  You're setting yourself up for embarrassment and hurt.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	i think you should text him ... i think i would get nervous to call him and sound stupid on the phone... he cant tell your nervous through a text message :) hopes this helps.|`|msGQPrrjaa	Text him.Take it slow and see if he is interested|`|bTP4lFFaaa	First off, yes, call him. Texting is a little cheesy as a first time to converse. You won't seem stupid, you will seem interested, which could make him catch your drift of you liking him.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, I hate to judge you, but I think you're just have a major crush on him, not 'in love'. Being 'in love' is the strongest emotion out there.....<br>  <br>  but yeah, call that guy and just have fun talking to him. Hopefully he will catch on, and like you back.|`|f68vMXQNaa	DO NOT CALL HIM. I REPEAT DO NOT CALL HIM!!! I just finished reading "He's Just Not That Into You" last night, boy did I learn a lot. Please don't call him girlfren, you'll look so stupid. Go out and buy that book, now. And read it. I seriously couldn't put it down lol. Guys are supposed to call you, not the other way. If he likes you he will, move on if he doesn't. BE STRONG!!!|`|LxOKTU7raa	hi yess or text is cool as well when you text him wll help you heaps to like you can say in texts where your going doing ask wanna meet up maybe ??? in a few texts that lets him know you care like him as things happen allso ask him to text u back when he can  then things will get better with time.|`|qIAcMeLgaa	Well, if you haven't really talked to him, try that first. It will show that you're really interested in him and not just another girl to flirt with or that he's just not another guy. Try to be genuine and don't overdo it on the flirting because that can be a turn-off.Good luck: )|`|ku8USJ49aa	yeah call him cause i know these 2 people and they liked each other but werent sure so  she called him and know they are bf and gf  and are like really close and can pretty much talk bout anything so yeah<br>  CALL HM!! hope i helped|`|IP4Bgxd5aa	i think you should text him, and make him call you.. thats what i do hahah|`|yyMRQkEmaa	CALL HIM??? YOU SHOULD TEXT HIM|`|NzuQnd5Naa	it depends if you actually talk to him.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if someone you dont talk to all of a sudden calls you?|`|3wWaj8BTaa	I deffffff<br>  thinkk you  should call him<br>  because if you don't you'll be wonderingg what wouldve happened <br>   so i think you shoudld just do it =)<br>  SO DO IT!<br>  anddd if things don't work out as planned<br>  well too badd for him<br>  screw himm<br>  but if it does work out good<br>   u better thank me =P<br>  lol kidding<br>  call!|`|PYBda7Taaa	Honey this is the 21st century! If you want to call him then GO AHEAD! Heck hes probably debating the same thing you are right now!I mean JEEZ, he probably wants you to call him to show you actually like him!   If you don't call hes going to think you're not interested! Gosh, GET A CLUE!|`|W6A9GADiaa	call him, but dont let him no how eager you are for him coz it will scare him off. b cool and calm bt try to show that you are a bit interested...<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|qS35btkHaa	just text him and just be like heyy(:<br>  <br>  dontt get ahead of yourself. if you cant even text him im pretty sure you arent in love with him.|`|Ygg4yI6haa	I think you should call him before it's too late.<br>  You'll regret it when the times passed.<br>  <br>  Now pick up that phone and call him now xD|`|EyngB5jcaa	How old are you? I'm betting 11.  Get a life kid.<br>  You're not old enough to be "in love so much it's crazy"<br>  You're ridicuolus|`|7OdkdFQOaa	CIf he has a phone text him start small make him call u first|`|tI3hTy9Baa	wait till he calls you-or text him if he can text..calling him out of nowhere makes you look desperate
VMY7No0eaa	I would suggest an alternate location... <br>  Tell her what you said here.. that you are not comfortable.<br>  and tell her you PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR GUT FEELINGS...and are usually right <br>  <br>  ALSO tell her to talk to the pastor/ minister of his church and see if ANYONE knows him or he is what he says he is.<br>  <br>  NEXT the teen will have the guy pegged on this first meeting... tell her to listen to her daughter... kids see through all the cra* of adults. <br>  <br>  She may be wanting YOU TO SEE/ MEET HIM too  (showing him off)
UPSys1POaa	You are the bridesmaid organizer. The bride has too much other stuff to worry about. Organize them to:<br>  - help the bride with stuff (invitations, etc.)<br>  - go dress shopping<br>  - plan & host a shower (optional) and give a shower gift<br>  - plan & host a stagette (optional)<br>  - give a wedding gift<br>  <br>  As for stuff to pay for, you'll need to buy your dress, shoes, jewelry, hair/makeup/nails, shower gift, and wedding gift. The couple should cover 2 nights' accommodations for you if you live out of town, and they may choose to cover some of the stuff you would normally pay for as a gift (for which you should express your gratitude!).<br>  <br>  If you're stressed out, do NOT let the bride know. Whatever you're feeling, it's nothing to what she's dealing with!<br>  <br>  Please don't be bossy with the bridesmaids. If you're planning parties, they need to be within EVERYONE'S budget, not just yours.<br>  <br>  On the day of, you will:<br>  - make sure her dress looks good. There is too much dress for her to reach around and straighten it herself.<br>  - sign the marriage license as a witness<br>  - hold her flowers while she does her thing<br>  - take all burdens off of her|`|n4d7rqr4aa	It varies from bride to bride, but basically you help the bride with anything she needs.  Whether it's advice on the centerpieces, or holding her dress up so she can pee during the reception, it falls to you.  Some typical jobs include a toast, helping with various aspects of the wedding and reception (dress, food, centerpiece, etc.), hosting the bachelorette party, and making sure the bride has everything she needs the day of (makeup, tissues, water, tide-to-go).  Your bride will clue you in on what she expects.  If she doesn't, just ask!  She wont be offended.  I'm sure she'd really love to hear "What do you need me to do?" and get some of the planning stress off her shoulders.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	anything she wants you to you put up with most of the crap and you listen to her complain a lot or that's how I see it. I am having a bridesmaid but I am not asking her to do anything except for get her dress, she volunteers all the time which is nice. My first bridesmaid I chose was going to buy her own dress,etc but then decided I should buy it and she wasn't around to meet up or anything. So I politely told her I chose someone else. I'm sure when it gets down to it she will let you know exactly what she needs help with.|`|cIJ960Wbaa	you will help her by being there first help her relieve some if the unwanted stress that will arrive during this process just be there when she needs help. So start off now always trying to help her I have the best matrons and bridesmaids in the world everything that I have ask them to do they have done it with a smile no matter how big of a bridezilla I am being.|`|Oh75DqReaa	make sure she didnt bleed through her dress<br>  theres nothing in her teeth <br>  and she has planty of liqour at the after paty<br>  xD<br>  <br>  you'll do fine just whatever she asks you to do<br>  and you may want to volenteer helping her with things<br>  im sure shes going to be going crazy with all the planning <br>  <br>  good luck <br>  :D|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Really all you NEED to do is show up the day of and be there for her. But in most cases, buy a dress, plan a bridal shower, plan a bachelorette party, and help the bride with whatever she needs help with.|`|Jy2ivop6aa	First, this is your best friend's wedding. If you want to STAY best friends, it's very important that you and her take some time to be clear on what she expects from you and what her ideas are for her wedding. <br>  <br>  Weddings can be very stressful for those involved in the planning. Do your best to assure her that you will be there for her, every step of the way! Make sure you honor all of her requests, and if you can not be somewhere or do something she asks, be sure to let her know right away. If you commit to something, make sure you go through with it!<br>  <br>  There are some very useful websites online to assist the bride and planners of the wedding. Just do a google search for whatever you need help with. theknot.com is a great website that my sister used for her recent wedding.<br>  <br>  The most important thing in planning a wedding is to be organized. Keep a box or folder of all the wedding stuff. Then, you won't be scrambling to find something. <br>  <br>  Being the MOH (maid of honor) is a very important task. You will be the bride's assistant in everything she plans. You should be aware that you will be responsible for purchasing your own dress, shoes, make-up, hair styling, getting your own manicure/pedicure, etc. Typically the bride will purchase the jewelry for her bridal party, but you may want to discuss that with her at the time you purchase your dresses. You may also have to say a speech at the reception. <br>  You may want to be there with her when she tries on her dress, goes to get her hair/make-up/manicures, etc. She may ask your advice in choosing the hall/reception site, church, photographer, caterer/food, etc.<br>   <br>  Planning her bridal shower can be the most work for you. You will have to discuss with her if she wants to be responsible for mailing the invitations, or if you will be doing that. If you will be in charge of invitations, you will need a guest list, complete with all of the addresses. Planning the menu and decorations for the hall or the place where you are holding the shower is also something you and the bride will have to arrange. Music, games, prizes, etc. are all to be considered as well. <br>  <br>  If you are to do a bachlorette party, I recommend making sure the bride really wants one and how "wild" she wants it to be. Depending on the age of the bride and the bridal party, you can always just have a night on the town, bar hopping or at a local club. If there are younger bridesmaids, consider just having a simple "girls" party at the bride's home, or maybe even your place?<br>  <br>  Most weddings these days do not have the traditional venues, and almost anything goes. In the past few years, I've been to weddings in Mexico on the beach, a wedding where everyone wore Medieval costumes, a traditional church wedding, and I myself plan to have a "movie themed" wedding some day. Just remember to be there for the bride in all aspects of her planning, and don't run away crying if she becomes a bridezilla. Wedding planning can be very stressful for the bride, after all. She wants her "special day" to be perfect. If she is your best friend, you may already have discussed the ideas she has for the "perfect wedding day". Hopefully you have plenty of time to get everything arranged. If the wedding is less than a year away, get to it! Don't wait until the last minute! That only causes a lot of stress and agony! If you have more than a year to plan everything, start an outline of what needs to be done and when things need to be completed. Be sure to stick to a schedule and budget!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your friend. I hope the wedding is beautiful, fun, and everything you hope it will be for her.
xrULvzbOaa	well, for starters you could learn proper English! That'd be really nice. It took me wayyyyy too long to get through all that garbage pretending to be English. Don't write like that.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	Can we have that again, using the Queen's English please?|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	You are only 14, and there will be loads of boys in your life. Take a breather from this boy and let him take the lead.  If he gets back in touch with you, that's fine.  But if he doesn't that's fine too. <br>  As far as making friends outside of school you can join any number of organizations. Do some asking around and maybe you can find a club to join with kids who may share some of your interests. Kids also do well in Church.  Usually your neighborhood Church has lots of activities for your age group.  Keep your chin up, this will pass. - affy|`|dYGLyVpzaa	If you like a guy who hates you then I'm sorry but its not gonna happen :( you could tell him how you feel but I have a feeling it won't go down too well :/<br>  In terms of making friends, go to youth groups, dance classes etc and meet new people! Don't be afraid of talking to people you don't know, just be confident and chatty and be willing to meet new people. You'll have friends in no time :)|`|nbYaKIVeaa	Sounds like he likes you but does not know how to show it.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	I can't understand your language. Which is it?|`|7Es1LjvHaa	Ease off the internet and join after-school youth clubs or get involved in sporting activities within school that will lead you to interact with other schools and meet new people. Take up a hobby that will take your mind off this lad and start afresh. At first, it won't be easy, but after a few weeks, you will notice the difference and you will feel a lot better about yourself. p.s - hang on to your mates from school and organise some sort of a fun activity with them outside school. You are only young once so don't over intensify yourself with all these emotional feelings. Just go with the flow and be happy and healthy.|`|ZiTIghRLaa	Your only 14 and have a lifetime to meet and make friends and meet boys. Don't be in such a rush to grow up.|`|rKuDDohDaa	learn to speak English and he might respect you more? <br>  Maybe he thinks you might be too unintelligent? I think you are.<br>  I'm 14 btw|`|CLFQZ4ggaa	Just tell him that that you like him and hope for the best. May be he likes you back!!|`|uCtj31SNaa	tmch txt . but youll get over it there r gnna b mre boys ull be intrsted in so get over h and move on|`|hbP6ykjpaa	I can't understand your language. Which is it?!!!|`|QMcuXXrlaa	Don't worry. I would do one of the following<br>  1) Tell him. That would be my first option. Girls and boys bug each other because they like each other. I know I do that. So tell him, and apologize, and maybe leave him alone and see if he comes after you. You don't know that he doesn't like you, he may feel the exact same way.<br>   :)<br>  2) If you're positive you can't tell him, back off for a while. Worry about other things in life, and come back to him. Give him a small break, you know? Maybe approach him differently next time, tell him about the crush or act like you/show a better side of you. <br>  <br>  Good luck, hon
TCVKpfeJaa	I guess it kind of depends.  I have never slapped a guy, but if I did I would step in, because if you can step inward its harder for the other person to catch your hand.  Short, quick movements have a higher success rate than raring back.  Good men don't assume a girl would hit them though, since that isn't exactly normal.  If you froze, I'm sure it was a natural and common reaction to any female hitting you.  While girls have a right to self defense, my father always taught me that if you hit a man you were putting yourself in the place of a man, and you better be ready to take it like a man.  Why did she hit you?
NB2AQwv9aa	sounds like she likes you alot but gets nervous around you , just be nice smile make her feel comfortable with you thats the bit thing comfortable the n she will open up abit more|`|FXCoGD44aa	I wouldn't classify this as "very confusing." <br>  <br>  Yes, I think she likes you. In fact, I think she likes you so much and subsequently has nervous behavior around you. Online, she give you one word answers because she's nervous and doesn't want to say anything that you would think as stupid [[not that you would, but she doesn't know that]].<br>  <br>  To get her to open up and give you better answers that make conversation, ask her questions that absolutely can't be answered with only one word.|`|uff3kOoFaa	awww!!! she's nervous around you!! cute! its okay. she probably likes you a lot!|`|ZqQU64hmaa	probably afraid to say the wrong thing. if you like her tell her and then she'll spill that she likes you too. trust me. the whole shirt thing...its wierd but she likes you :]<br>  <br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsoLSbbbwII0Oqz0QdMeDUPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226141311AA0SO1n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7fdeTRhPaa	One word answers usually indicates annoyance.<br>  Maybe you creep her out.|`|ptPazvB8aa	*sigh* ...............luke............i am your fa-ther...........ok im done<br>  ok lets get on to buisiness.

So she doesnt want to say too much and say something too imbarrasing.|`|tZES73R0aa	Probably because she is shy.  If she likes one word answers break the ice with her and then ask her some questions.  Dont talk about school.  That seems pretty boring to me.|`|0dlSudzBaa	i think she does its just she is nervouse u should be more forward with her and show her u like her to x :D good luck x x|`|JbrJgJGjaa	She's just nervous

WTF.  how can you live like this?|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I think you married to young. I think he wants to play around and be free. Perhaps it's time to call it quits and move on. Sounds like their is too much hurt and trust issues between the two of you for this to ever work,.|`|tsfDizhOaa	I think he's just scared to be in a serious relationship.Give him some space to think about everything.Or maybe he's going through some hard times and he's taking his frustration on you.Idk if it helps but good luck to both of you.Life is hard.Don't let it bring you down.|`|KHeNPZ5Aaa	The 2 of you got married way to young and he sounds imature.

daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Because saying it and doing it are two totally different things. Maybe to your face he's saying it but in reality he's not ready for the step.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Yes, it makes sense to me. It means "I am not ready to give up the selfish part of my life and make a formal commitment that binds us together and makes you a partner in all of my decisions from here on out."<br>  <br>  It also means, "I think I'll still like you a few years from now, but I'm not sure that something better won't come along in the meantime, or I might take the job in Phoenix, or maybe I'll go backpacking through Spain."<br>  <br>  It can also mean, "None of my friends are getting married. I feel way too young to be making these kinds of decisions, even though I really care about you."<br>  <br>  But in the end, none of that matters. If you are ready to get married and he isn't, there's no guarantee that he ever will be. YOU have to decide whether you can be content moving at his speed, or if you need to cut ties and find someone who is on the same page as you are.|`|0Id85yiYaa	you can't rush this. if he's not ready, he's not ready. pressuring him into marriage will only make it backfire sooner or later.|`|AA10975867	The guy has what he wants. You are being totally committed to him because he has told you he has the prize safely tucked away. You know he has a diamond -for "someone" down the road- so you are hanging around hoping that he will pick you. If he REALLY knew that you were "the one", he'd be taking you to select your setting . After 5 years and with no money concerns, there should be no hesitation on his part. If he is still "unsure", then don't get your hopes up. A new woman could walk in and sweep him off his feet. It happens all the time. Guys delay and delay for one reason or another but when the right one steps in, they can make the proposal decision immediately. If you are over 25, it's time to put yourself back on the market.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes it does. I have known people who were together for years who didn't feel the need to make their relationship legal but yet they are faithful to their partner the entire time. Everyone does what is best for them and their own situation. <br>  <br>  You can take the initiative yourself and propose to him. But if he already said he doesn't want to be engaged, then don't force it on him becasue if you act desperate, you will create a rift that will be unrepairable. Move on to someone else if you intend to give him ultimatums because he is not doing things on your schedule when you want them done.|`|TkPJYlaMaa	Not necessarily, it's a personal thing. Maybe he wants to be with you, but he feels he'll be tied down. Are he's afriad getting engaged will do something bad to the relationship. The only way to really know is to go to the sorce. Ask him! Tell him how you feel, and tell him you need answer. On the other hand, love is patient, you know what I mean? Just make sure you get both sides, before doing anything.|`|36ff857df7ec751866efe603f8e9b6aaaa	maybe.  maybe not.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Sometimes people take longer than others. Maybe he is scared of what could happen if he makes this commitment. He may want to spend the rest of his life with you but and actual engagment is scary to some people. Maybe he is worried about the future. When he says this, ask him about it. Why does he feel this way? Does he think that something bad will happen if you did get married? Does he feel like he is too young for this choice? Communication is the key thing, and it is best to work on being able to really communicate before thinking about marraige.|`|r3xuKqakaa	maybe he's just not yet ready , being engaged puts pressure on him because it means you guys are going to have to get married some time , it doesn't mean some time soon , but the marriage date is sure to be marked on the calendar , and not something you can dismiss after you're engaged .|`|cIJ960Wbaa	It's not about $ money and its sounds like a good idea many people rush into marriages and spend tons of money getting out of them because of not being ready. I have been wth my fiance 5 years and we just decided to get hitched back in may 08 we just werent ready to let go of the single life and that was ok for us.It took us having a long conversation about our wants  and needs to determine if we were ready mentally, spiritually and financially you have to thk about all those things when you are getting married you become one. So to make a long story short just sit him down and talk to him and ask were does he thk the relationship is going|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Settings cost money too. And it takes time and effort to have the stone set. I think it makes sense. My boyfriend and I know right now that we want to spend our lives together but we aren't ready to get engaged. Hopefully in a year or so we'll be at that point.<br>  <br>  After five years - MOVE ON! If he hasn't committed yet, he's not going to. My boyfriend and I have only been together 6 months and we have a 5 year plan - by then we want marriage and kids.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	You have been waiting for 5 years??? Why is this so hard??? He should have proposed already. The fact that he has not just shows that he is just not that into you. Why don't you wait another five years????|`|ePT3hRO0aa	I think it does make sense. <br>  Edit..(will be back)|`|83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	The feeling of being trapped.  I will give you an example: <br>  <br>  <br>  Then someone has an elderly parent or another family member that needs constant care in the home- the duty almost ALWAYS falls to a female in the household.<br>  <br>  There are times, however, then the duty falls to a male member of a household.<br>  <br>  <br>  When studies were done on the effects of stress on a person when caring for another member of the family, some interesting results came out.<br>  <br>   A much higher percentage of the woman were "stressed out" over the care.  While they did tend to have more domestic duties then their male counterparts outside the care-giving- this did not seem to be the largest cause of their stress.<br>  <br>  Their male counterparts felt much less stress- and actually garnered more self-worth and pride out of the care-giving then their female counterparts.<br>  <br>  The reason?  It was expected that the females would do the duty.  of all the other parties in the situation, they all assumed that the female would gladly and easily take over these duties of care-giving because she was female.  These females usually had feelings as if they were trapped in the situation, and never really had a choice- and did not feel the same increased good feelings of the male caretakers because it seemed as if "well of COURSE you can take care of someone- your female, and should have  not problems with it"<br>  <br>  <br>  When the males took on the caregiver role- people would support them more, give them more praise- because it was not a traditional male role- they got more credit for the same work because they were male.<br>  <br>  <br>  Doesn't it seem odd?  <br>  <br>  <br>  It all comes down to having a choice.<br>  It's the illusion of choice.  Your job may not be so depressing because you say "HEY!  I can quit any time!"  - although you never will quit- you can't- you need to pay bills and eat.<br>  <br>  You still in theory,  have the illusion of choice.<br>  <br>  In the situation with what you have- you have someone who is not looking at marriage as vehicle in which to make love grow more because you are committed- they see it as a bear trap - something will strip away all choice for them.<br>  <br>  There is a finality in the whole dealing- and if you have someone who is bad at making major decisions to begin with- then you are really going to have a problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Choice was always a thing for my husband.  I trusted him, but I wanted him to feel as if I was not trying to control him, or take his choices away from him.<br>  <br>  When his co-workers were going to a strip bar (this was when he was younger, he doesn't do this anymore)  He came home to tell me where he was going- and expecting me to "not allow" him.<br>  <br>  While it drove me NUTS- I knew it was really only my problem (as long as I trusted my husband)  so I told him I did not expect him until late- late, and even looked for dollar bills in my purse to take with him.<br>  <br>  He came back (not too late) and told me that some of his co-workers lied to their wives about going.  He seemed to feel proud- and bragged to his co-workers that not only he told me where he was going- and not only did I not have a problem, I gave him tip money.<br>  <br>  YES- I was chewing nails when he left- but I didn't tell him that- I never wanted him to feel trapped.<br>  <br>  It's perception.  Perception is reality.<br>  If he feels like he will be trapped if he does, but has nothing to lose if he doesn't then he won't marry.<br>  <br>  I have read an article concerning how as the marriage rate goes down- more woman are finding themselves too old to have kids.. and why?<br>  <br>  This situation exactly.<br>  <br>  A woman will spend years with a man- but he won't marry.  She starts to age past her prime childbearing years, and then they break up- and he turns around AND GETS MARRIED to a woman 10 years his junior and has a kid by her.  Suddenly he's ready to settle down- but it's not with the first woman.... <br>  It's because after the break up- he realizes how OLD he is- and that HE doesn't have as much time either.. and starts cracking on the settling down.<br>  If you want to "Settle down"  you have waiting long enough. <br>  <br>  You now have to decide if you can wait for him- and chance him leaving you old and childless.. or dump him now- and go hunting for someone who WANTS to settle down.<br>  <br>  You are ABSOLUTELY correct- you cannot wait forever.  Much like bananas you buy at the store- you have a very limited shelf life.<br>  <br>  Don't be a banana.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Sounds like he wants to be with you.... but before he makes a real commitment he wants to be able to run around and do his own thing. I don't think he's honestly ready to get married but he just doesn't want to admit it. It is a big step for him to take, and if he is scared then he either needs to get over that or break up with you. But to me it sounds like he wants to have his "options open" like if a pretty girl he meets and likes her... its easier to break up with you now then divorce you later.<br>  <br>  EDIT: 5 years... hun if he hasnt put a commitment into your relationship yet, he never will. sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do and you shouldnt put your happiness on hold for him. find a man who wants what you want|`|F8iYNurEaa	My boyfriend was the same. He always spoke about when we were old we would do this and that, and about when we had kids and what we would call them etc etc. He always made it clear that I was his number one and always would be. It took him four years to propose because he wasn't ready for that step, but when he finally did do it, it was amazing. I know it is frustrating, and it didn't make anymore sense to me than it does to you. Give it time and it will happen.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	He wants you to know he wants to be with you for a long time, but is not ready to make the "engagement" commitment yet.

If you carry on doing this, he may not ask you......ever.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Yes it makes sense, me and my bf have been together for 5 years, we know we will be together forever and we have talked about getting engaged and we will but because we know we will always be together theres no rush to put a label on our relationship, it wont change anything between us.|`|wQXcD62Maa	Yes, it makes perfect sense. Engagements and marriage are a big deal. I'm sure he loves you, he may just not be ready to settle down yet. Don't pressure him, let him make his own decisions.|`|atDPIS43aa	Maybe this guy isn't ready for the pressure of being being engaged.That probably plays a really big part in this situation.|`|82XPLs8Zaa	it makes perfect sense, maybe he thinks that he still has to accomplish before settling down.|`|0hSs6CtHaa	You are going to scare him away with your desperation!|`|0dlSudzBaa	it makes sence ur just not ready for the label / commitment yet ! youll knw wheen u r :D just tell him xxx he will understand xxx

I do not even need to see his picture.<br>  <br>  If you two live in US, I can predict that that there is a 50% chance that your marriage with him will end in a divorce; there is a 70% chance that there will be some form of infidelity in your marriage.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Is he a medical person? or maybe a writer? I see the potential for deceit in his eyes. I think he is educated. He seems slightly arrogant and something of a "smooth talker".<br>  Just my impressions.|`|AA11678629	you never know who is the type to cheat. but i can tell you if he is getting women he has to be paying for it. not too many women are going after that one|`|rDmMk9Soaa	He looks like a nice fellow, but SHE looks like she would chop you up in little pieces and store you in the freezer.<br>  <br>  Run!

He looks like a nice enough guy, but he could be a serial murderer. The face itself doesn't give any clues. But his words or actions might. Do you trust him? Do you have reason to believe he is cheating?|`|1epjqrflaa	Addyfish, you cannot ask us that and expect a serious answer. You cant tell if a man is a cheater by looking at him.  You can NEVER tell by looks, ever hear that saying...dont judge a book by its cover.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Cheaters come in all forms, back grounds, education, etc.  There is NO way to tell if some will cheat or not just by looking at them.|`|ZEitfScGaa	lol...I don't think you can tell if someone would cheat just by looking at a person. Do you know the woman he is with? If not than maybe I guess
PGanZdtmaa	sometimes its the people out side of the "loop" or the relationship that sees less of a difference ect. then the ones "out side the loop" so i think you should ask her if shes happy and then tell her what you see she might get mad but at lest she knows|`|l45tBjTVaa	You should tell your friend to watch it because many abusers are controlling and the best way they start and continue abuse is by keeping their victim detached from family/friends. Make sure your friend truly loves this guy and knows who he is.<br>  It's not natural for someone to be that controlling and it could lead to some serious problems later.|`|GGwOjodDaa	Your right her boyfriend is controlling her and you should tell her or at least warn her. And maybe you should get your self a boyfriend to keep your mind off of her and on whats happening to you.|`|vBf6U8jhaa	No you need to be forward and tell her what you think. <br>  Friends are supposed to tell each other everything even if it's harsh etc. Tell her how you feel explain to her that she is contradicting herself. If she doesn't like what you say then she isn't a true friend and would honestly have someone (Who she thinks) loves her.. then have true friends in her life. I would give her an ultimatum. Because unfortunately it has come to that. I am not the type to give friends ultimatums but if she is willing to loose friends over a guy than she needs to be set right.
GyZuqT4daa	If you want to be sneaky, you can hide your phone somewhere and then ask her to use hers to call it so you can find it. Then you can say something like, "hey now we have each other's numbers, we should talk sometime". I wouldn't do it unless you're on pretty good terms, it'd be really creepy if you called her after that and she wasn't expecting it since she didn't actually give you her number willingly.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	Ummmm just go up and to ask her.|`|W28ALDEmaa	lmfao. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D0555EtAZ4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D0555EtA...</a><br>  <br>  It may not get her number, but it will probably make you laugh. <br>  <br>  Just be like, " Hey girl your pretty awsome,  let me get your numbeer ( This is where you pull out your phone)  And be like, I'll call you laterrr.<br>  <br>  lmfao. <br>  Guys Just ask for my number. <br>  Just be cool about it.|`|I5SypMlsaa	How To Get a Phone Number- A Super Quick/Easy Way<br>  January 13, 2009 by: Sean White<br>  <br>  Hey champs! BabyFace here for a quickie about how to ask a girl for her phone number…and get it 99.9 percent of the time. This is a super easy and quick way to do it.<br>  <br>  How many times have you been talking to a cute girl at the gym, or the bar and chickened out of asking for the number? We’ve all been there. With this technique there is no excuse for not getting the girl’s number. Let’s jump right in:<br>  <br>  Foundation: Before you go for the number. You should already have been talking to her for a little bit. Basically she has to see that you’re not creepy or weird. Keep in mind girls give their numbers out ALL the time. Especially in bars and night clubs. It’s totally normal to exchange phone numbers with a beautiful woman. This is how you do it…<br>  <br>  Step 1: You can say something along the lines of “haha, you’re cool. Maybe we’ll hang out sometime.” Note that you’re not ASKING her “Do you want to hang out sometime?”- this is weak. You’re telling her very casually, that maybe you guys will hang out.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Say: “Give me your phone” or “Do you have your phone on you, ok, give it to me”. At this point she’ll probably think you’re just another dude who’s going to punch in his number that she never has to call.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Once you have her phone. Punch in your number and save it in her phone. Then dial it so your phone will ring and now you have her number too. If she asks why you’re calling yourself say, “oh, I just don’t pick up numbers I don’t know.”<br>  <br>  That’s it, 3 easy steps. The main reason why this works is because you are taking the responsibility off of her and you’re leading. So next time you find yourself face to face with a beautiful woman just say, “You seem fun, we should hang out. Give me your phone”-Punch in your number, save it in her phone, then call yourself with it. Done and done.<br>  <br>  This is how I personally get numbers these days. Have fun guys!<br>  <br>  7 Things to do When Talking to Women on The Phone:<br>  January 21, 2009 by: Vincent Decerto<br>  <br>  We’ve already covered the some guidelines to stick by when you’re face to face with a girl.  Today many people have difficulty with talking on the phone with someone they not familiar with. This isn’t a problem that only afflicts a younger, more internet dependent demographic. I’ve talked to plenty adults who get nervous about talking to women, or business prospects on the phone. With the increase in internet communication, being good on the phone can be one way to set you apart from all the other guys that email/IM/text her. Here are 7 guidelines I use when calling women.<br>  <br>  1.) Prepare: Begin by jotting down a few interesting things that happened to you in the past few days. Don’t write elaborate paragraphs, but a few words about topics of conversation. For example, today I went out and got some kickass fruit salad, watched slumdog millionaire, and I just finished up a hard workout at home. These can be my 3 “go to” topics in case the conversation starts to die out. Elaborating on each one of those topics, and making a small joke about it can lead to a few minutes of conversation easily.<br>  <br>  2.) Crack a few jokes: This is key. Guys that are naturals with women have a good sense of humour, and joke around a lot. The best way to do this is to bust on her a little bit for something that she did. You’re not making fun of her as much as you are teasing her. This is really important on the phone, and in your daily interactions as well. This type of teasing peaks their interest toward you (if you’re face to face, you’ll know you’re teasing her right if she starts hitting you lightly, pushing you away playfully, or laughing about whatever it is you’re saying).<br>  <br>  3.) Lead: As with most things that are woman-related, you need to lead. Lead the conversation where you want it to go. This doesn’t mean to be talking most of the time, but know that when she is talking about something it is because you’re down with that topic. If she starts discussing something you’re not OK with, change the conversation to something that you want to talk about.<br>  <br>  4.) Tonality: Hum before calling her. Basically make the type of “ohhmmmmmmm” sounds that people do when they’re meditating for yoga. When you’re humming, take your voice to high levels, and to low levels to get a good range going. Right before dialing the number hum in a low baritone for about 5-7 seconds. Apart from subtle relaxation reasons, this helps your voice have more resonance, make it deeper, and more dominant.<br>  <br>  5.) Call her by her name: Don’t go crazy with this one, but using her name a bunch is good for creating comfort, and building rapport.<br>  <br>  6.) Availability: Similar to when you’re kissing her, be the first person to say bye.  this shows that you’re a busy dude that has a bunch of stuff going on in your life. You took some valuable time out of your schedule to talk to her, and she should be appreciative towards that. You’r|`|Enlj7cQzaa	just ask her for her numba and pull out ur fone. that way she ll  know that ur serious!!!!!!! then txt her and ask her out.|`|EIzs2OWeaa	Ask her if you can use her phone for a minute. Then add yourself as one of her contacts.|`|mYjtC4Graa	um what the heck? haha just ask  man..|`|WKoG3ujFaa	If shes playing with her phone or you just see her phone in her pocket, just take it from her as a joke and put ur number in and just make it noticable that u took the phone and ur putting ur number in.  When she sees u put ur number in her phone then just be playing with ur phone and maybe she will take urs|`|H7evKKdIaa	Just be like, "hey I was gonna see if you wanted to hang out the other day, but I relized I didn't have your number. Why don't I give you mine or something so we can keep in touch." Most likely she'ss agree and exchange hers  with you too!|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Just ask her if you could get her number. If she says yes, then pull out your phone, if she says no then keep it in your pocket.|`|0OaW7CD8aa	start a converstation with her and all of a sudden just say.."hey we should exchange numbers"..and pull out ur phone..she cant say no to that...|`|djUMvICoaa	Ask her for her number, that you would like to call her if she didn't mind.   You will find out if she is interested in you if she gives you here number.|`|FVTSOJBKaa	buy her a cupcake and write it in frosting :) I would give my number to any guy that gave me a cupcake!|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	just ask straight up|`|PYQsv6eMaa	don't she'll probably dump you, you|`|5qnUV5U2aa	this is kind of smooth... if you have a camera phone you can take a picture of her, maybe shes doin something funny or she just looks pretty or she's dancing but whatever it is find an excuse for a picture then show it to her (make sure its flattering and she likes it) and tell her you'll send it to her if she gives you her number.. kind of sly like and make sure to laugh afterwards as if it was almost a joke.......... works everytime :D|`|GJ2H94OMaa	do you have mutual friends? if so you could simply set say to her "A group of us were thinking of going to see that new movie/try that new restaurant next week.  Would you maybe wanna come? Let me get your number and I will call you when we know for sure what day and time we are gonna go"  If you don't wanna really do movies or dinner then you just say that every ones scheduled didn't match up.  <br>  <br>  Or you could say something like "It would be cool to hang out with you this weekend, maybe I can get your number"  She may say that she'll just take yours and call, but if she is into you too than she will for sure give them digits up!<br>  <br>  Hope it works out!!|`|plFyCtm3aa	Depends on how she looks at you. Are you guys just friends or do you flirt around here and there? Smoothest way to do it is to ask her out and get her number after you ask her out. If you just straight up go for the digits, then that's really bad on your part.|`|MRRNmyeRaa	Simple, and pretty obvious :)<br>  Just ask, not trying to sound like a total mack daddy! Lol.<br>  But just ask tell her that the conversations you had with her were very interesting, (if they are; don't be a liar!) and that you would like to talk to her more so can you guys exchange numbers :)<br>  If I was her, I'd feel pretty good that you enjoy talking to me and hand over the digits.<br>  Hope you get it ^.^|`|eVPkWZU4aa	Im a pro do it this way : <br>  1.

7pwEy0p7aa	figure out who you like first. if you like the other girl too,and she already thinks you like her and you know she likes you back, then don't risk ruining things with her if you don't even know if the girl you want to ask out will say yes. idk if that's confusing or not. basically, if you think the other girl is worth your while, don't go ruining your chances with her because of some girl who may not even say yes. if you decide to ask out the first girl and get rejected, then you can always go back to the other girl, who would probably still like you. but don't go asking her outright after you ask out the other girl. and don't be afraid of rejection, if she says no, then she doesn't know what she is missing. good luck.<br>  <br>  please help <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227143424AAEAqWD&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|r6oaBPhiaa	why are guys cowards these days, go ask her , get some courage and  do that|`|PbESvbu6aa	the only way to find out is to ask|`|HinSwo97aa	i'd ask her who she likes, or have a friend be like a wingman.<br>  if you want to, i'd ask her.<br>  if she says yes, then great<br>  maybe she'll want more time to get to know you better<br>  or you can just tell her you like her, but not ask her out. let her get used to it before feeling pressured of being asked out suddenly.<br>  <br>  if it doesn't work out, consider the other girl you kind of like.<br>  <br>  play in the field.<br>  best of luck!|`|iZYw500Vaa	Bro just ask her dont be afraid.. and if she rejects you the worst thing a man can do is feel bad for himself.. dont show weakness.|`|AA11485494	make sure all your feelings are realy for her, you dont wanna go out with her and end up liking the other person then its frustrating|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	Well first of all, you have to figure out who you like...

cGbTJobeaa	Chill!<br>  <br>  Only one of you has to be Catholic.  The Catholic has to have gone through the previous sacraments. So, the priest will ask you to provide a copy of your records. No big deal...you have until a few weeks before the wedding to get them from your childhood parish.  If you haven't completed the necessary previous sacraments, the priest will guide you in the next steps.<br>  <br>  I went to a Catholic - Jewish wedding once in the Catholic church, so apparently the other person being baptized isn't a requirement.  My husband is Methodist, so he had to provide a copy of his baptism record.<br>  <br>  Beyond that...they will ask if either one of you have been married before.  If either one of you have, they'll tell you what you need to do to get that issue cleared up with the Catholic church.  What is typically referred to as an annulment (but the Chuch has its own lingo for that) can take up to 2 years to be granted.<br>  <br>  You have a class that you take. Ours was an afternoon marriage enrichment class.  And you meet with the priest or deacon a few times. It is nice and I thought the entire process was very useful and it spurred some good conversations between my husband and me.<br>  <br>  The other thing is there is a test.  Don't worry, it isn't really a pass/fail test.  It's more like a compatibility test.  If there are some areas in which you are off the chart incompatible, the priest might open up some conversation on that issue with you.  Ours didn't.  Other than that, the test really justs makes sure that you are not getting forced or blackmailed into marriage and that neither one of you is abusive. Assuming that you are a normal healthy couple, the test is no big deal.<br>  <br>  Actually...my fiance and I both thought the test was fun and it also promoted some really good conversations between us about our expectations for marriage.<br>  <br>  I'll probably get some thumbs down on this, by people who hate the rules and regulations and everything else about the Catholic church, but I really thought it was a great process to go through in preparation of marriage.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	We had to take the Foccus test and we had to go to pre cana. We were never really "approved" or anything. He never mentioned anything about not being able to marry us. And this was in a Catholic church.|`|UPSys1POaa	I'm guessing you're Catholic? My husband was baptized Lutheran, but is a non-practicing Christian, while I am a born & raised Catholic. When we went to get our paperwork done, I was asked "Will you raise your children Catholic?" "Are you and your fiance related in any way?" "Are you being pressured into this marriage?" "What does being Catholic mean to you?"<br>  Then they asked him "Will you support your wife in raising your children Catholic?" "Are you related to her at all?" "Are you being pressured into this marriage?" "What religious experience do you have?"<br>  <br>  Basically, I think it meant to find out that I was not viewed in a negative way in the eyes of the church, and that my husband was supportive.<br>  <br>  I don't think you need to worry about "approval" unless you and your fiance are related or you're being pressured to marry. :)|`|fHlppQwCaa	Well I am going thru marriage prep for the Catholic Church... and it is not that bad!!  Typically they have you answer a list of questions and you will discuss them with the Deacon... They are not asking the questions to be nosey either (that is what i thought at first) they just bring up questions that you guys as a couple have not thought about discussing... It is not that he is approving it is more that he is making sure you are not getting married because you are having a baby or that anyone is forcing you to get married..  Those are the 2 main things that he would deny you getting married at that specific loacation... I hope this helps... and if you have to go thru the marriage prep try and let it help you as a couple!!  i feel like I am getting to know my fiance even more than i did before!!  it is very benneficial!! <br>  <br>  Good luck!!

If you're both on-board with the fantasy, go for it.  The problems arise when one of the partners was pushed into it and ends up regretting.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	Every answer that said don't do it, it is a bad idea has got a thumb down.  So that is definitely what you don't want to hear.  Anyways, what is in fantasy, leave it in fantasy, it is more fun that way.  There have been instances where the husband started to secretly meet the other woman.  Yeah we all are very sure about our relationships, but bottomline is why ruin a good thing.  (i see a thumb down to this answer...lol)  Married and single life is quite different...|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	You had better be 200% sure of your relationship with your husband before venturing into something like this. While a lot of men fantasize about 2 women in bed with them, having it actually happen can change your relationship forever. What if he enjoys it and demands it become part of your sex life, what if you find it disgusting and yet have to repeat it for his benefit, what if you decide you desire women more than him and begin to shut him out in favor of another female, what if he finds the other woman more desirable than you......how do you reverse any of these and possibly other scenarios when You are responsible for introducing it????? <br>  I'm not saying that only bad can come of this experiment, many find it very rewarding and strengthens their relationship, just keep in mind that even the Best of intentions can go horribly wrong.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Not a good idea.  A marriage is a sacred special thing between two people.  When someone else is brought into the picture it can and will lead to problems eventually.  i think this one is better left as a fantasy and the two of you should be able to live your lives with just the two of you!<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope I helped!|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	Is your fantasy to do a woman while your husband is doing you or for you to watch the joy your husband gets from doing 2 women? It makes a difference to him.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	If you dicuss the activity together thoroughly beforehand and both of you are in agreement as well as getting the same agreement from your perspective partner, all should be well. Remember to have an out in place, whereby any of the participants can stop at point if they feel uncomfortable. Discuss the activity afterward to address any concerns that might have arisen ior even to talk about how great it was. Always be upfront about any feelings of discontent or discomfort.<br>  <br>  These situations can work if done properly. In order for them to be done properly, there must be a great deal of very honest, open communication. Everyone needs to be on the same page from the get go.<br>  <br>  PS-Why no kissing? Kissing can add to the intimacy of the moment. Also don't forget to make sure you agree on safe sex practices!|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	Believe me, this fantasy idea WILL definitely lead to trouble. Marriage is about two, that`s why you get married, to be with just one person. If you want to fulfill fantasies including a third person, that`s for single people! <br>  Before you ruin your marriage for a night of fun, think clearly about what you`re having in mind...you`re either too young to be married, or married too soon.|`|roCnIlzyaa	Unfortunately, it causes problems! My husband and I have tried this twice. The first time was kind of a drunk, i'm-down-for-anything night.. and the next time, rules were made.. but we still fought like CRAZY after both times.|`|tbJraueLaa	think of it this way,  if I was in the room with you and your husband, hubby would have no clue you were even in the room.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Not something that I would do. Some people can do it, but I also believe that they are not truly in love. <br>  Would you're husband be willing to bring another man into the bedroom?

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	before i got my hopes up i would just ask her, because she hasn't mentioned it to u. if she has plans eventually divorce him, its not a sure thing yet. maybe mention to your daughters how u feel, and i am sure they would get the message back to her. if she has regrets about u, that's a good sign.i am sure if she had the chance to go back in time where things were good, and she could find peace, that she would choose to. if i were in her shoes i would jump at this chance. talk to your girls about it, and see what happens. and if she is talking more to u it means she still has feelings for u. just let the kids know and this will offer her a way out, and hopefully she will be more than glad to take it.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It sounds like you are reading too much into what you've heard from your daughters and phone calls where you get vibes, but your x has not mentioned anything about getting back together. I think you are unconsciously or consciously giving your daughters the idea you and your ex may  reconcile. That's not fair to them. You're talking as if  it were a done deal, already deciding how you would love her boys, not try to replace their father, etc.The perfect blended family. You need to live in the real world. If she's having trouble in her marriage it is none of your business and unless she says so it is not a sign that she may be planning and getting a divorce and come back to you. Live your life and do not take these giant leaps of faith based on nothing concrete. If she gets a divorce it will be her decision and not something you should be putting all your hope into. Just let things follow their own rhythm and what's meant to be will be.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	You were married to her first, so naturally there is a bond, plus you have children together.  If she does divorce her former x fiance, and you can be assured that she will not try this again, then yes.  But think about your children first, and whether or not this will be confusing for them. Be honest with your kids and she needs to be honest with the boys as well.  Because you will be a blended family.|`|n2leN4ewaa	No, don't do it.. She doesn't want to get back with you! If she did she would've left this guy!!.. TRUST ME I've been through it.. Sounds to me like shes just saying this crap just IN CASE they don't end up working out. GET CUSTODY OF YOUR DAUGHTERS because they shouldn't be raised in that sort of environment (they'll grow up thinking thats how relationships should be) FIND a woman who will respect you. ONce a cheater always a cheater PLUS DO YOU really want to take care of 2 kids who aren't yours? think about it|`|34b40Vu3aa	It seems like she doesn't know what she wants, as long as it isn't what she currently has.  I wouldn't.|`|AA11146198	First I am sorry to hear about your divorce, but it sounds like you have two wonderful daughters who love you. It is very good that they get along with their new brothers too. I think because she has not mentioned getting back together, you should not jump the gun and assume that is what she wants. Maybe try to make things more fun for all of the kids and always keep in mind that you guys always argued and things are not guaranteed to be great if you guys who get back together. I think it would be a good idea to get closer with the girls and then see how it goes (with mutual discussion) from your ex-wife.|`|iYyzY9sUaa	do it for the girls <br>  but watch out cause you might get stuck wit two brat boys<br>  love is love my friend.

Life is about serving yourself and helping people in a non-violent way. It wont make you happy. The US government treats their men like robots, not as individuals. That is my only advice.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  All i'm saying is, if the government isnt drafting, then your help is not needed. Go when called. You have a life to live in the meantime.|`|JKWq4N7Faa	I'd day forget the military. <br>  Your friends and family are the most important things in your life, and you should always be considerate of that. <br>  Just tell them that you'd rather not go, because you'd miss everything so much, and they should be able to understand. <br>  <br>  Good luck in making a decision :)|`|CyGvN11jaa	do what u think is right my bf  wants to join the army and we have 2 kids

875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Why would your husband hate you? Hate is a pretty strong word.<br>  What has he done to make you think he wants a divorce? Express to him how you feel. If he is negative about it. Leave. Your baby will be better off in a healthy environment.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	If you are being severely mistreated then he needs a wake up call.

BQN7j62Faa	See if he is taking advantage of you. Give it time. If nothing seems to be wrong, then he is a friend.
lvfqg8Goaa	Sounds to me that he is extremely shy, if he wasnt into you then he wouldn't become so self concious when you are around. <br>  I think he is just shy and nervous - he may want to impress you so much that he doesn't want to make a fool of himself so recoils. the hugs are a good sign.<br>  Its not your imagination, we girls like to anaylse but it seems all too much of a coincidence. <br>  i say put yourself out there and ask him, because if he is shy then you may be waiting awhile for him to do it.<br>  And if nothing then is it really your fault for acting on teh signals he was throwing?? NO!!<br>  <br>  go for it and be confident. guys dig that.|`|8949424ca0f2c2313038716280df4c9aaa	i think he likes you but don't always assume  just watch longer and see how things are  ask him if you want<br>  i would ask- what am i to you...although that is a bit direct if helps you understand..if you don't want to ask him directly ask his friends...or have a friend ask him for you...hope this helps <br>  <br>  but if you think it is your imagination, again watch for a bit longer...if you want u can confess but if  your shy find another way you can communicate that u like him <br>  ie hugs, holding hands...going to the mall together...stuff like that|`|7OdkdFQOaa	He totally likes u girl good luck!|`|trpvcTBiaa	He like you but feels nervous.

Tell the one that is calmer and nicer and doesn't hold a gurge to say sorry to. Maybe he will forgive. Well actually I hope he forgives you, too. If they don't forgive you then they were never your friends from the start. I wish you good luck!! :)
28aa15ff815174fd0da9e6d6dd19aeedaa	OH MY God!  Your bridesmaids dress and your dress couldn't be more perfect together.  Absolutely darling.  I love them!!!!!!!!

Best wishes.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I actually like how the bridesmaid dresses tie into your wedding dress. It makes the whole thing look polished and put together. The flowers are pretty as well, although I'd avoid a lot of green for the bridesmaids. Too matchy with the dress color.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I think it all looks really good together. The bridesmaids top of the dress is very close to the top of yours. The styles are great with one another just close if you like it than go for it. I say have fun and enjoy yourself.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I think your dress and the bridesmaid dress is toooo matchy, they look the same and you want to stand out on your wedding day.  I would choose a different bridesmaid dress.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	I think it's a great combo. I really like your dress and I've always loved the pink/green combo.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I think the flowers are lovely and the bridesmaid dresses are very pretty, I would be very careful not to ''overdo'' the bridesmaids as your dress is beautiful but its very simple and elegant and they might stand out more than you. Im sure with a tiara or veil and everything you will stand out more.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I like the bridesmaid dresses, LOVE your dress...The flowers are pretty, but if it were me I would have more of the pink in the bouquet, and less of the green...I think it takes away from how beautiful the bouquets are, and I think they will look better with the dresses without so much green..|`|UPSys1POaa	I personally think the bridesmaids' dresses look too similar to yours. It's good that they're in the same formality, but your dress isn't anything special!<br>  As for the flower girl, go with a pretty white dress that she likes and will wear.<br>  The flowers are beautiful. :)|`|F8iYNurEaa	Definitely stick with everything you have chosen so far. It will all look beautiful together. Yes the bridesmaids dresses are very similar to yours but I think it all looks lovely. Let's face it....no one is going to mix you up with any of your bridesmaids in that dress!!!!!|`|Mv5ixsJIaa	LOVE LOVE LOVE your dress!!!! It's so unique and pretty! I really like the bridesmaids dresses and flowers with it. I love how your dress and the bridesmaids both have the clam shell tops, I think it ties together nicely.

xgfOfJc4aa	you can't MAKE someone love you but you can do these things to help:<br>  1) show him you definitly have an intrest<br>  2) get to know one another-you might not like him as much as you thought!-<br>  3)just see what happens if you get in a relationship<br>  4)have patience - love shows up when you least expect it-|`|mIj2EtY5aa	it's all a matter of getting to know someone, and then seeing if you're<br>  emotionally compatable. seeing if you have a future together is just<br>  in a matter of seeing how much you have in common, and if he likes<br>  you, he'll ask you to date him, maybe be his girlfriend. from there, <br>  take it slowly. love is something you don't have to rush if it's true.<br>  <br>  hope i helped you.

I1ZzNNpiaa	exactly the same as me, im desperate to know my fathers name but im scared of asking my mum, best thing to do is ask a relative, i'd ask my grandmother but im scared if i do find out who he is, ill want to talk to him, and what if hes not ready to meet his daughter hes not seen for 14 years? or what if hes busy with his own life or not interested? you have to think about these things :)<br>  good luck with finding him x|`|WU6pTTvCaa	The fact that you wont talk to your mom about this really means your not ready for the next step.  Most men would not tearfully embrace the fact that they have a daughter that they have not seen for the last 15 years, but be totally pissed at the woman who kept this knowledge from him.  You mother would be blindsided by a man she has not seen in over 16 years . . . an how would THAT improve your relationship.  Just talk to your mom, at your age most teen feel they don't look like their parents or that they MUST have been adopted.  If you can't talk to the woman who has been there for you all your life . . . don't search for someone who may not be there, or worse yet, may not even want to know you?!?  Sorry, this could be a painful wound you open and there may be good reason you don't know about it.|`|U2N5kQmlaa	ok go to the hospital you were born and ask who your birth dad is bring some kind of i.d.
5N3odm3Qaa	First, it's "he and I" or "my boyfriend and I."<br>  <br>  Second, your step-mom is of questionable moral character. This is unsettling, considering she's married to your father. However, that's not my problem, but you should be aware that this woman probably has considerable emotional control of your dad. <br>  <br>  Third, relationships should not be defined by the distance between two individuals. If you love him and he's temporarily far away (though remaining faithful) then wait it out and go with your heart.|`|r3xuKqakaa	don't listen to your step mom , don't get anyone else . <br>  be faithful if you really believe in him . because it will be cheating on him if you do , and i know you wouldn't want to do that . <br>  <br>  DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO , DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR STEPMOM .|`|vtafeEIJaa	No one is faithful|`|LHbdPdg3aa	Stay faithful.

1Bto3sZeaa	The law (in any country) is very ornery, and doesn't always 'make sense'.  The final outcome isn't always based in law, sometimes simply that judges 'opinion' at that given moment.  There could be a number of reasons why that particular judge in that particular case gave the kids over to the father.  You should have posted a link to an online source of this case so we/I could check it out to give a better judgement (pardon the pun) of this position.<br>  <br>  In any case, most likely, the father has more 'ability' to care for the children.  Whether that be financially, emotionally, time-wise, etc.  Or, maybe the father just has a better lawyer (hence more wealth) than the mother... sad but it happens all the time (naturally).  Or, the children may have actually 'chosen' the father over the mother, as maybe he 'treats' them better than she does.  We really don't know... as I said, w/o knowing the true 'story' about the case, we will never know.  This is just IMHO.  Take care.|`|aBqJhdufaa	She hits them, he gives them cash?|`|HG0742a9aa	there must have been some compelling reason that the father got custody, since normally judges are more likely to give the children to their mother.|`|Z933rtuLaa	Quite simple really, the father can provide the better care.<br>  <br>  Despite the fact that the courts are duty-bound to give custody to the mother, based on an old-boy network and caveman instincts, occasionally they will take note of the facts of the case and recognise that the father can offer a better environment.<br>  <br>  The "environment" encompasses the children's feelings toward the given parent, schooling available, time of the particular parent available to the children, lifestyle, safety of the children and so many more factors that I would have to charge you private rates to fill you in properly!<br>  <br>  But what is most important is that when a father gets custody these days, it is because the mother is a danger to the children.<br>  <br>  In hundreds of years time, maybe the courts will make decisions on the above criteria.  But for now, Dad only gets custody when Mum is hazardous.|`|saXxWTkZaa	Occasionally a judge will see sense and award custody to the parent most able to take care of the children as I don't believe its always the mother. This might be the case here, it might also be that the mother made no contest and simply allowed the father to have them but a Judge still has to award it. There are so many reasons...drug abuse, who shes dating, alcohol abuse...too many to name really. <br>  <br>  If you're feeling uneasy about her in some way it won't hurt to trust your instincts and try to dig a little more.|`|hmjAwZQEaa	The mother may be a drug user or possibly an alchoholic, she may have also wanted the kids to live with their father. The father may also have a better environment to raise the children.|`|TXY6EAYqaa	It could be possible she didn't want the responsibility of them.|`|UymjYnGHaa	If the mums a looney thats why my dad has custody. :)

I went through the same thing with my best friend a year ago, and despite them promising you that they will change, they never end up changing. So just give her some space, don't be mean about cutting the friendship off, but keep your distance from her. Over time, if she does in fact change back to who she used to be, then you guys will still be able to go back at a later time. So keep the communication going, but keep a safe distance and let things cool off. You don't want to ruin a friendship when there is hope later.|`|d8Bbyqpuaa	You need to lay out the rules and remind her whenever shes doing something that isnt fair to you.<br>  If she takes advantage of you, tell her. If she doesn't stop, don't let her or try to take advantage of  her.  <br>  Get it through her head by telling her all the things you hate when people do. If she's a good friend, she would listen to you.<br>  <br>  If not, wwalk away.|`|LNRn4RGHaa	Don't let anyone use you. People who only use you are not true friends. But if the issues began rapidly and out of nowhere it could be because she likes you in some way and is trying to hide her emotions from you. Try asking her why she has been acting the way she has. Try this before yelling at her because yelling will only make things worse. Hope this helps or at least points you in the right direction.|`|CiqbsEOUaa	I understand that because I am in the same situatipon. You should try distancing yourself from her for a day or two and then if she doesn't notice what your doing then she probably doesn't really care about you and you should sadly just move on.

The "best" way depends on whom you ask.<br>  <br>  I do affiliate marketing primarily so you can guess what my answer would be. Is that the best for you? Well, I can't say.<br>  <br>  If your just getting started I would put a lot of effort into learning about internet marketing in general. Methods, products, where to sell and most importantly... how to do it.<br>  <br>  It's that how to do it part that's difficult to find.

Tell them you'll call them when you get to place B.|`|SioLF1bNaa	Greens.<br>  It's called $$CASH$$ son!<br>  Bribe her:)
XOoxPm0gaa	The best thing is just to be there for her. I would suggest that you go over there with a giant tub of cookie dough ice cream and/or chocolate and put in a comedy movie. Preferably one where a girl kicks a guys butt or something female empowering. She is probably feeling horrible and wants to know that despite being boyfriendless, she is not alone.|`|b8lSaCQfaa	just say to your friend that you will always be there for them and just listen,and  listen what your friend have to say about, how your friend is feeling. listening is the best way and when you responding to your friend just say that "your so right", "i know how you feel", that's horrible" and so on. then to cheer your friend up, always make your friend laugh and yeah it will totally work, trust me :)|`|eVXEYsmxaa	Just let her know you'll always be there for her, and if she gets really upset she can come to you.<br>  Give her a shoulder to cry on, if needed.|`|AA10986891	Tell her <Don't cry cause it is over, smile cause it was wonderful. Take the great memorie you have from that time and smile>|`|8d42bfdda82b255679a249cc8e70cd53aa	Just be there when she needs you,and this is one of those times.Try to take her mind off of the situation, go to the movies see a thriller action movies No love romance stuff.Basically talk about everything but him because it brings the flames,and be around a lot.
auUeI2Vnaa	He's a 14 year old brother.  There's nothing you can do.  Trying to do something will only fuel his fire and make it worse.  Best to just do things that embarass him (but not let him know you are doing it intentionally)...like include a picture of yoruself in underwear in an email to your bff....that'll scare him off. lol.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	um,pimp slap comes to mind|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	get one of your friends to send you an emai about how hot he is and how so many girls (name a few that he wouldn't be caught with and one or two he really likes) and have them put on there that they are trying to get the courage up to ask him to meet them at the park, mall, movies etc. . Make him think that someone really wants to meet him and set up all the details, once he falls for it and goes to "meet" this person, you and your friends be there waiting and give him heck about why he is there too and don't let up. After a few minutes, say that will teach you to read my emails.|`|3lSRiTLTaa	you could set a password on your internet account then just sign out when you are away from your computer; if it's in your room you could get a door alarm.... (if you think this is silly they are extremely loud and you can hear them from anywhere in the house.) you could also beat the crap outta him enough that he knows you are serious.|`|vrFBkvKeaa	Your parent's aren't helping because this is totally normal.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would fight dirty.  Sneak through his stuff and find something you can blackmail him with.  Tell him if he doesn't leave you alone you will show it to the world.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Why not log out of the computer before you walk away from it?
SgrjTkwdaa	She might like having you for a friend, but not a boyfriend.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Sounds like she is obviously not interested in dating you, and made that clear to you. Don't wait around for her, be her friend yeah, but go find a girl who wants what you want.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	well, if you really loved her and if you are ready for commitment then you should wait. wait until she is ready. that way she knows that you respect her instead of just wanting sex. you know? i hope i helped and if i didnt then i hope someone else does. bye ;)|`|msGQPrrjaa	She was honest with you and that is good.College is a hard time.Maybe she will find time far you but she seems like a good woman.At least she's honest|`|eTBfsjCUaa	It sounds like she is just trying to blow you off but still keep you around in a nice way.|`|dalNxu8zaa	do the studying thing and try on days she works for a few min..|`|h6wWSTHBaa	dude that sound like a bad burn that needs some ice and lotion. It means she doesn't like you and doesn't really want to tell you to your face. so get a new crush date her, and get yourself booked on those days you study with this current crush. This girl is just using you for your smarts.|`|jLNnwWcpaa	she sounds like she likes u, :) girls R busy, so dont doubt it, ok and when ure in the hall next, then just u kn ow try to get close, or try kissing her, and tell her more about u, ure past as a child, ask her about things that interest her. it should help u hope i helped u.....clovers|`|5eBXB9lKaa	are you asian by any chance? im just judging by your name...and this is going to sound racist but im just assuming that you're japanese or something dating another japanese person...and usually japanese girls come from very strict, education-oriented families....so its probably in her (and yours too, i guess) culture to put school first.<br>  if im totally wrong you can just ignore this lol|`|lIx6kngbaa	Your gonna have to respect her schedule obviously she is really involved in school. Some people are able to put aside petty things like boys and romance and focus on their future. Some people just cant mix relationships and school together. Shes obviously a very driven person, and want to focus on her school, let her, but always be there for her.  Once she matures a little I think she will be more open to a relation sip she obviously likes you. But still hang out with her on those 2 days she'll really appreciate it. Good luck|`|whFHzbvuaa	like she said... shes too busy with school and work... these are the types of girls worth waiting for... she has a good head on her shoulders and wants to be able to support herself before she brings anyone else in the picture... just let her do her thing and you should do the same... just focus on your school work and support her... she obviously likes you so you dont need to stress about anything right now but school... just wait it out and it will all be worth it in the long run...
dFVztW7kaa	Well, ok, first of all, she gets asked out by a lot of guys- I bet you she doesn't really like a lot of them and feels weird about being asked out by them. Picture it yourself: Random guys you don't really like asking you out. You would probably feel really weird. <br>  Plus, SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND. You've got a best friend who loves you for who you are, and that's a great thing to have. Even if you have a bad day, you can always think on the bright side that you still have your friends and they love you.|`|1OxiOk2taa	Just remember that no body is 100% perfect- no matter how much they act like it. Do not compare the things she is better at- just be thankful for what you do have. You obviously have friends, after all this is your best friend, and she wouldn't want to be friends with you if you didn't have an awesome personality. So just be thankful for what u do have and the jelousy will go away!|`|74IQlMkLaa	If its beauty, look in the mirror and try on your best clothes, best looks, makeup. Do that for at least an hour and you will realize how pretty you are, and how much your gifted. and maybe you have no invites because you always have a frown on your face because your jealous. Put a smile on your face and be your best.|`|uvl63dwlaa	umm try to think about the cool stuff about you that she doesn't have...something thats totally you but she wouldnt come close to it....hope that helps..i also get super jealous :o|`|Zzz54djtaa	Do what the people in the Cheeto Ads do|`|cggkcAC5aa	quit being soo down on yourself
DcVoq5Tuaa	you could do this to the 18 yr old, penny him into his room. If he has the door closed, slip pennies into the open space between the door and the door jam. This will create a suction and he will not be able to open his door from the inside. ( had it done to me in college)<br>  <br>  for your sister, every time you see her walk into the same room as you, or wherever you see her, run up to her and give her a big hug and kiss and tell her you missed her. (this will annoy the crap out of her-my sister used to do it to me when we were younger)|`|agGG5LX8aa	Similar to "POP's" answer, but its really funny. Get a doorbell. Hide the speaker somewhere in their room where they'll never find it, and press the button all night. It will be hilarious!|`|SdDvbPf0aa	plug a alarm clock in a closet, or somewhere hidden. If there isn't a place where you can plug something in secretly, then just set a loud alarm clock sometime early in the morning.The concept for hiding it where they can't find it is, so that they will have to get up and look for it, but setting a loud alarm early in the morning can be annoying too!|`|W0633l18aa	older fashioned itching powder in the pants<br>  <br>  swapping shampoo for blue hair dye<br>  <br>  plastic insects in their pillows so they think it is real - best for sister<br>  <br>  hiding very obvious condoms in your brothers room for parents to find<br>  <br>  superglue on toilet seat might be a little extreme and involve a trip to the A and E<br>  <br>  bucket of water on top of door<br>  <br>  pouring sand or insects in bag<br>  <br>  putting make-up on their face while they sleep <br>  <br>  gd luck - personal fav is the shampoo one|`|aXXTHpHBaa	My idea is PERFECT!!! I have done this to a friend and it was so funny!!!<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.craiglist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.craiglist.com</a> (thats a website were you can advertize anything. So go there and make an ad saying "In search of a boyfriend or girlfriend" and leave the person's number on the ad. In the next 5 minutes when random people see the ad you made on their behalf the random people will start calling him!!!
m8VVCrKkaa	I wish there were guys like that in our school, because there's girls like that in our school.<br>  <br>  If you want to find one try going to a youth group. Some of the girls there will date guys with morals because they have them too.|`|620435831a260a57d4798da422b767c7aa	Um, dude....so you are asking girls out, like on Yahoo Answers? Cause I am not getting the question.|`|yyMRQkEmaa	i am just the same bout a boy! to bad you dont go to my school...
aXYiOskmaa	it sounds more like she's trying to convince herself what a great success she appears to be without thought to how she makes others feel. those that brag like this are usually the same ones who aren't as happy as they seem to be.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	when a person has to toot their own horn it means they have a very low self esteem.success isn't measured in money but in a persons character and someone who brags, needs to be constantly assured that they are special, and have more than the next guy.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I would avoid her and her family.<br>  <br>  When someone is unpleasant, you avoid them.<br>  <br>  So, next time they want to come over, tell them you're busy.<br>  <br>  Don't be rude, don't be impolite. Be civil and kind....but just avoid them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|WvOvoxLxaa	The husband is out of school and has a job she is all most out of school so they have had the rough times behind them.  They where not always that set and with no worries. You are still in school and you will have your careers when you get out of school.  I will say most of the people I know that have to shout to the world about what they have, really don't have anything. They talk about money, but they don't talk about their happiness with each other.  So let her comments roll off your back just like water off of a duck.  You should be proud of you successes and go ahead and shout to the world if that will make you happy. After all what they are shouting about would bore other people that have more than them.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	Different strokes for different folks...don't let it bother you. The only thing that is important is that you and your partner are happy. Just remember, there are a lot of miserable, rich people in the world. Sounds like you have your own riches! Good luck!|`|8rxXVBFuaa	Those who need to brag about their uccesses many times are in trouble. Be confident in your success and do not worry about others|`|1FvUBC4Zaa	Obama and the demoncrats will fix their little red wagon. Now anyone making over 200,000 per year is "rich" and obviously didn't earn it, so they will be taxed into submission.  Next year anyone making over 100 grand will suffer the same fate, and in 2011, 75 grand.  <br>  <br>  So you won' t  have to worry about getting even.  A pharmacist under the new socialized medicine program from the "messiah" will be under strict limitations as to what the government will allow them to earn. Much like Soviet Doctors who made as much as ditch diggers did.<br>  <br>  Thank GOD for the Messiah|`|2P2K0rl2aa	She feels the need to brag because she's insecure, and she's running around trying to 'prove herself' to other people.  What a sad way to live, and no tax cheque, no matter how fat it is, can fix that.  <br>  <br>  It is understandable why you are jealous, I mean everyone wants to get ahead in life, but do you want to end up like her?  Just look around you and enjoy your own successes, and don't worry about anybody else's.|`|wwB3csfYaa	Yes and I know what it is. She is not happy in her marrage. She sees how you two are, and no amount of money can buy love, her husband has probably been unfaithful or they simply do not love eachother. It also may be she wants children but hubby doesn't. There is something lacking between her and her man.<br>  <br>   She may be rich in gold, but you are rich in love. <br>  <br>  Next time you invite them to dinner, insist they come to your home. say "it may not have too much room, but it sure is cozy! Besides, I really want to cook from my kitchen. Come on over! I insist!" Be happy around her, maybe it will rub off.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Yes, the same situation.  We had 3 beautiful children, I was a stay at home mom, so we struggled.  Our in-laws could do no wrong, everything was always perfect for them, home, cars, you name it.  What really brought home about how lucky we were was when I was told to abort my twins, because they would not survive, I chose to risk it.  They are now 22:)  My sister-in-law got pregnant a couple of years after I did, had the perfect pregnancy, and when the baby was born she had complications.  Her baby died.  I never ever envied them again.  My heart still aches for them and it has been 20 years.<br>  Lesson:  Everything is not as it seems.  Enjoy your lives and the love you have for each other.  Not everyone will have that.|`|S253XERKaa	yes i don't like bragger's ether just let it go in one ear and out the next the table will turn on them what goes around come around i have seen people brag and then fall flat on there face i don't make myself any better than any one Else yes your sister in law  has to grow up money not every thing tell her how you feel about the way she is and tell her to grow up
1LgXCEgtaa	Dump his sorry ***. He wants a mommy not a girlfriend.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	You have made life really easy for him.  You basically said you will make all the effort for the relationship and let him get away with doing nothing.<br>  <br>  You can't really blame him - he's become conditioned to the fact that he doesn't have to do anything, and it seems to him that you're just happy to get nothing.<br>  <br>  He's not suddenly going to appreciate you.  He won't turn into the devoted, effort-making and dedicated boyfriend you expect.  People don't change that much.  As for love - actions speak louder than words.|`|f7aed8ce48808e701a4034d72a8b8bd6aa	Sounds like you have made life so convenient for him that he doesn't want to change.  He lives rent free, has meals prepared for him, and gets laid regularly.  Why should he change?  Why have you not at the very least insisted that he pay for some of your gas?  Or why doesn't he spring for a hotel room near you once in a while.  To be honest, he is unlikely to change.  The question is, do you want to live this way.  The decision for how your life is to be is up to you and no one else.  God bless.|`|uuMCGT9taa	give it time to move w each other im 23 living w my bf and thinking its good to wait at that age until u can get him to be 50 /50<br>  <br>  also have him feel ur tank for you sometimes !!!<br>  <br>  tell him i have the gas to get there but none to come back see what he says|`|ruczpWrGaa	He doesn't sound mature enough for the relationship.   It is give AND take.  not a one way street.  <br>  <br>  My ex husband dragged his feet on us getting our own place.  He never got over wanting to live with his mommy.<br>  Some guys are just looking for a new mommy.  Yours might be one of them.|`|93546fdb2e067ecf5800cd861c95c57daa	You've given up too much to make him happy but he does nothing in return to appreciate you. If he's not making the effort to even come visit you at your home for a few hours then it's not even worth maintaining the relationship. You're still young to move in together so do yourself a favor: don't make the effort to visit him, save your gas, save your money and worry about your education. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying to act like a child but let him know that you're tired of this and if he doesn't put an effort forth then it's best to find someone who will make the time for you.|`|7W8ihXA4aa	If you're only 19 then for goodness sake have some fun before you move in with a man.  If he doesn't appreciate what you are doing for him now then it will only get worse.  19 year old boys have a totally different mindset to 19 year old girls and can't cope with the emotional stuff as well.  I say go out and have fun with your girlfriends and he will soon come running when he thinks you are having a good time without him.|`|UjajMHH4aa	take it from me, when my boyfriend moved in we werent together, he moved in to get away from family issues, but we were really good friends and both of us knew that we would end up together. So about 2 months after he moved in we decided to use the title boyfriend/girlfriend, though techinically we had been "together" for so much longer. At the beginning i hated him being clingy and i was always distant from him, then gradually as i started actually falling in love with him i fell too far and devoted my whole life to him. I lost my friends, i did'nt go out anymore, i always wanted to be with him, and then it all turned around and i became the clingy one and he became distant. He broke up with me last night cos he cant take the strss of me nagging him to spend time with me anymore.<br>  <br>  Don't devote your life to him the way i did. I did everything for my boyfriend, i loved him more than i have eveer loved anyone before, i did everything he wanted. All just to get closer to him, and in the end it drove him away. <br>  If he wants to be close to you he will. Take a step backand see what happens, let him come to you. even if it means not going to his house all the time, and see if he says anything. If you want him to appreciate you you need to give him the chance to realise exaclty what you do for him. And don't devote everything to him, cos there is the chance he will turn around and say i don't care anymore, just the way mine did.
EWrHbTpmaa	Jay Jay,<br>   i say tell him...<br>   then tell him you felt very much like a Bad Girl and you need a Good spankin for being naughty..! <br>  <br>   and after all is done don't forget to thank him for setting you straight and you'll "Try" to be good, no real promises though.  lol<br>  <br>   Have Fun|`|NBDLUOkiaa	If your husband gives you sex for getting a traffic ticket and this is an effective manner in which to get it let me know, because if it is I will have the cops chasing me in a high speed chase that the world has never seen before.

Sex is IMPORTANT to men.  It's #1 on their list.  So if he's totally physically healthy and doesn't want you on the regular...........you two need to talk.|`|y9CgveCGaa	Is crying effective?  I say the odds are 2:5 based on your previous Q&A.|`|HPiFrjfCaa	umm, why would you have to get a ticket for him to give you some? he's your husband, that shouldn't be a problem. maybe you should sit down and talk to him about what's going on rather than crying and hoping for sympathy sex. besides, i doubt crying is going to make him give in and do it if he hasn't so far.<br>  <br>  good luck with everything|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Oh my that's not too nice of him. Don't listen to people here who say he's cheating though, they don't know anything about other peoples situations just judging from one question, so they have no right to say that, <br>  <br>  Seth.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Crying is a turn off to me.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i think he has issues concerning his parents divorce, and nothing can shake ones world as much as seeing your parents split up, the people u thought would be together forever. he is just insecure, but certainly doesn't fit the bill of any man who is cheating.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	He probably feels rejected, and yes, vulnerable. When you ask someone to marry you and they tell you "no", it's a blow, no matter how you look at it. If your relationship is strong, it will overcome this obstacle, it will grow. If his behavior continues to be the same for a long period of time, it wouldn't be a good sign - but for now, try to be patient and help reassure him that you love him and you want to be with him, just don't want to get married just yet.<br>  <br>  When my husband and I first started dating, there was a period of time when he felt somewhat insecure; he kept making jokes about me "getting tired of him" - but what it really was, he actually was afraid that I *would* get tired of him and leave. However, as more time passed, his fears have gradually dissipated. I was never like "oh, baby, I will never leave you", etc etc, but I was just very steady in my behavior towards him - always respectful, always supportive, always loyal. Words alone won't reassure the person - the steady attitude day in and day out will.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I think it is an honest answer from him.  When you turned him down about the marriage it probably felt like you didn't want to commit to him.  Just tell him that it's not that you aren't in love with him and want a life time with him but that you aren't ready for marriage just yet.  I'm sure his mom's actions has something to do with it too.  Just be patient.<br>  Red|`|AA11319441	Sounds to me he's way more serious about you than you are about him.  Plus he kind of sounds like a puss.  I wouldn't want to marry him either.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Sounds like to me both of you have no bsuniess getting married right now. Date and have fun.|`|ixHwF4apaa	avoid him|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	It's true usually the accuser is the guilty one i never believed that until i fount out first hand that it is indeed true, For instinct my husband has never trusted me from the day we met up until the day he left me for a co-worker.It all started to make sense he was the one out whoring around and because he was doing it i must of been doing it to.|`|AA10818265	You turned down the idea of marriage...he is feeling vulnerable. He is feeling vulnerable because you are not as serious as he is - you are not ready for marriage. He may take that to mean that you are not that into him.|`|CEfdxXI9aa	He's probably screwing around on you...|`|bc5LZrsAaa	Go with your gut feeling. You cannot build a marriage without trust.|`|9mcpblG4aa	i think because he goes away he doesnt want u 2 cheat on him. sum guys r protective like that. good luck!|`|0LlRUBWlaa	i would say " until i give you a reason not to trust me, lets just enjoy each other "|`|SovaFpN8aa	He is insecure. He was probably floored when his parents got divorced, and he is struggling to understand why his mom cheated on his dad. Deep down, he is afraid the same thing will happen to him. He is having trust issues, because he trusted his mom, and she turned out to be untrustworthy. This is not a reflection on you, it is something he has to work out inside of himself. He is afraid he is going to lose you, so he is pushing for marriage.|`|TI65WNunaa	It is not your fault that guys check you out lets get that clear, as long as man has walked this earth they have checked out other women.  He has even done it himself so don't believe that he hasn't  He may be feeling insecure because he is traveling for work and know that you are home, again that's not your fault.  He has to get over it.  I would be upset if my man was constantly making veiled comments about me hooking up or whoring or whatever little title he wants to call it.  Just because he mentioned marriage first and said I love you first is not a sign that he is any more ready or prepared than you are for marriage.  I think a little counseling would come in handy, he clearly has issues about being cheated on considering what his parents went through.  You should not have to put up with mental abuse over it.  Talk to him seriously about how you feel.|`|COs7vGWSaa	that sounds like hes guilty of somethin. if he has nothin to go on then he has no reason 2 accuse, or mabey hes scared cause it happened to his parents. jus sit down and have a real good talk with him|`|B2cvkTp7aa	It's awful that he makes "jokes" about you "whoring" yourself out. What kind of person does that? <br>  <br>  You DO NOT WANT TO MARRY THIS MAN! He will never trust you. Do you really want a life where if you are an hour late he will call you a whore and say you hooked up with other guys.<br>  <br>  My dad also cheated on my mom, but I have never held that against my husband. This guy has emotional issues, and you marrying him to make him feel secure is not the answer. He will still feel that way after you get married.|`|QfYhCYUTaa	If his mom cheated on his dad after 25 years of marriage, he's probably thinking it can happen to anyone at anytime. That and the fact that he poured his soul out to you and wanted to marry you and you said "not yet" probably is making him very insecure. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's about him cheating...I think it's exactly what he said. He loves you and doesn't want to lose you. With him being gone all the time, maybe he thinks you'll find someone else
6rl8IQCraa	ugh i hate girls that pull this bs on guys.<br>  <br>  i think shes just confused how shes feeling.<br>  <br>  it could end up either way,  she could just want a break for a while,   or she might want to break up.  <br>  <br>  in my case,  my ex girlfriends 2 week break  turned into her going out to dinner with one of my friends and her breaking up with me through a text.    hopefully your situation will turn out much better|`|D3LWtwsqaa	same thing happened to me, and it ended in a break up :(<br>  things were fine and then out of nowheres he says he needs a break but i complained too much about how i couldnt take being on a break so he called it off. he said if the break didnt work then we were just going to stop spending so much time together and then out of nowheres comes the breakup. prepare yourself...|`|ih1JD5xYaa	I went through the same thing myself recently man, its not easy to think about trust me, but if it happens it happens...give her the space she wants and respect her decision...its no reflection on you its her that has the problem|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Breaking up
dV6E3sHMaa	age doesnt matter.|`|AXZQoaxnaa	yess not to put her down or anything a junior in highschool has noooooooooo buissness with a 8th grader|`|QWXBIdvDaa	no not really..u shouldnt mind who she likes|`|hTgnvLOSaa	No. It's her business who she likes.
fs8wMQLFaa	Hm, you were pressured to do something back there. That's awful. If you have other friends, go to them. Sounds like they're treating you really badly. Apologize if you want to get back with them, but no guarantees. <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hugs Smiley|`|NzuQnd5Naa	Well, they aren't your real friends, and if you can, demolish their petty little faces.|`|xifW428Taa	Get a new one.<br>  I will be your new freind.
qpAYU8Knaa	First of all I am sorry for your loss.<br>  He may be a genuine guy who is trying to help you ease back to the flow of life by talking to you, offering a job and asking you out for lunch. But these things are usually done by someone you already know for some time. A person who is practically a stranger should just stay back and let you deal with your feelings. His actions are extremely tacky if he is trying to hit on you or trying to get a good deal on the camera equipment. That shows that he is only interested in his desires without considering your feelings. He is very naive and impractical if he is trying to help you because you hardly know him. Use him to sell your cameras and if you need a job, but move at your own speed with the rest of it. You will do well so don't worry.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Just make it clear to him that you aren't interested in anything right now.  You don't even have to make it look like you suspect that he may be interested.  When he asked you to lunch you could have said something simple like "I'm sorry but I really don't feel like socializing just yet, I'm still grieving." Most guys would get the hint from that.  And if he isn't interested then you didn't make it sound like you thought he was.  I'm so sorry for your loss.<br>  Red|`|TI65WNunaa	Its not your imagination he is being too nice.  Just let him know up front that you appreciate the job offer but right now you are grieving and the next time he mentions buying things you are selling have a friend present so he has to keep the conversation brief and courteous.|`|asxqampCaa	he wants you in a dark room but you won't be developing prints.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Be wary, you are vulnerable right now and some people try to take advantage of situations like yours. He may genuinely been interested in having a relationship but if your not interested tell him to back off.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Gosh, I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  My guess is that he is interested in you, not so much the camera stuff (you can buy camera stuff from someone without inviting them out to lunch), but it's entirely up to you if you want to give him hope. In your situation, I can see how you might not be interested in getting involved with someone right away. It's perfectly ok to keep declining his invitations, and if he's a well-adjusted individual he will get the hint after a few failed attempts.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	If he didn't buy the camera then he probably isn't going to buy the other equipment either.  He knows you are vulnerable.  If you are not interested, and if he isn't going to purchase anything ask him to stop calling you.
ma6Re8B1aa	When my kids were younger, I stayed at home. And if I had the chance to do it all again, I would stay at home. because I don't trust anybody with my kids!!!! Thats MY job to raise them. If I didn't want to spend time with them and raise them, then I shouldn't have had them. Why have kids if you aren't going to be around. Thats half the problem with some of these kids today. They have no one to turn to. Everybody else is raising them but the parents. I know some of you have to work. I'm not talking about those types of parents. I'm talking about that one parent may be a lawyer and the other a doctor. They have nannies raising their kids??? THAT IS JUST WRONG!!!!!!!
j3rKUI3eaa	I met a guy when I was living in scotland who i thought was the be all and end all. To me, he was the beginning of my new life, and as someone who had never been interested in having kids, I even found myself picturing starting a family together. Things were perfect for a long time.<br>  <br>  Anyway, he dumped me quite suddenly and I was absolutely heartbroken. I have never ever felt pain like I felt then. And to be honest, there was no one way that helped me get over it. It just took a lot of nice wine, a friend with a shoulder to cry on and a LOT of time to heal.<br>  <br>  I swear you don't know who you really are until you've had your heart broken like that. You'll come out of it a stronger person believe me :)|`|3xATKPNTaa	I know what you are feeling and can understand the pain. I just found out that my wife had an affair that she wants a divorce now. The only thing that keeps me going is my two boys. I would say hang in there and try with all your might to get out of bed and do something outside and try to exercise as much as possible. If you get active and exercise than you will start to feel better about yourself and have less energy to think about him. I wish you the best and will say a prayer for you. Hang in there. <br>                        Huntington Beach Dan|`|Dm1pkrXTaa	feel your pain but life has more... if you two are soulmate, why it's ended. And if you two are still soulmate, can't you still be friends with him?|`|iFWUhpiOaa	I felt that way with the last person I was with and it's been seven years since I've had a relationship. I don't know how long you were with your partner, but I was with mine for 11 years. He walked out to be with someone who he thought of as his soul mate (The most crushing blow of all!) and that lasted 4 years. In the seven years we've been separated he's been married twice and is now being dumped by his current girl friend. Believe me when I say, after you get done feeling like you're going to die you'll be ready to get even. When you've exhausted that emotion, you'll be ready to change yourself, I lost a ton of weight but have gained it back now. I have the satisfaction of knowing there is such a thing as carma. What comes around goes around. I've been alone raising my kids, but I've been happy. It doesn't sound like he's been too happy for too long a stretch at any given time! We are friends now. We share a 16 year old who he's just come back into his life as well. But the moral of the story is this. Yes, you will find happiness again. Most normal people don't go as long as I have with out finding someone. It is a process you have to go through. It's like someone has died. You morn then you get over it. It is so easy to say and it feels like it will never happen when it's you going through it, but it will!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Yes, I felt like that with my ex husband.  It does get better, but I have to say, I still think about how I felt when he walked in a room, and the loss now is tremendous.  He has found someone else, and so have I, but it will never be that way for me again.  My advice?  Start seeing someone asap.  It is the only thing that will make you start to heal.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	yes i was in your shoes a few years back, after being married 10 yrs in fact. what your now experiencing is a normal reaction to loss. your could be describing how i first felt. the worst part was the betrayal, the other woman he's been seeing right under my nose and the lies. u do get over it but u have to face your pain, feel it, for however long it takes. first u have to accept it as something that sometimes happens that u didn't expect. u do get over it, and life goes on even if right now u can't see that far ahead. pain never leaves us in the same spot that it finds us. meaning the pain diminishes. i got over it by never showing my pain, keeping my dignity, divorcing and cutting all ties even when its not what i wanted to do. also i moved away, and began a new life, began dating again, even though it felt wrong. and allot of prayer and talking to god.|`|ruczpWrGaa	i went thru that.  a lot of us do.  but somehow we all find a way to cope.  me, i went thru this a year ago. i didn't know what to do.  i was completely broken hearted.  so i stayed single for a little while. even closed myself off to the prospect of love and a relationship.  I ended up just focusing on me. <br>  <br>  But then back in november, i met the sweetest most amazing man ever. i couldn't be happier.  <br>  <br>  things do get better.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Yes. I felt like that about my first marriage. He was my first love, and when he left, I was absolutely devastated. <br>  <br>  It's been 20 years since the divorce, but I can't honestly say I'm 100% "over" it.  Out of necessity, I've moved on enough to have a life and eventually find another boyfriend, but sometimes it still hurts. Sometimes I still cry and wonder "what might have been."  I let myself grieve for that moment, but then I go on with my life...and try to count my blessings and be thankful for my children and for the things I've achieved even without having that man in my life. <br>  <br>  Not an easy thing to do at time, but necessary for one's mental survival.<br>  <br>  Despite all this bravado one sees on TV shows like "Sex and The City" ... A heartbreak isn't always something one gets completely "over" like one would get over a cold...especially if you had several years invested in an intimate relationship and you share both memories and children.  Instead of playing 'tough' or act like nothing's  wrong, it's best to honor and accept your feelings.   If the bad feelings get too intense, though, some short-term counseling/therapy might be a good idea. They may use talk therapy or in my case, I went on Xanax for a bit until I could get a better handle on my anxiety.  There's no shame in it...everyone needs a little help now and then.<br>  <br>  Eventually, though, the loss will be just become something that you learn to live with, kind of like a small scar that doesn't completely go away, but after awhile you don't notice all the time.  <br>  <br>  They say time heals all wounds...and I believe that to be true.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	I have definitely felt that, it is the worst possible emotional pain a person can ever feel.  I used to wnt to stay in bed and cry all day too.  You can take a pill for a headache, but you can't take anything for a heartache, the only thing you can do is give yourself time.  I promise you, you will feel better, even though it's hard to believe right now.  Go and date someone else, because that will really help with the pain.  Also spend time with family and friends, and take on a new hobby, all of those help too|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Nothing I can say.  Nothing ANYBODY can say.  The ONLY thing that will help is time.  Time won't solve your issues or make the pain go away, but eventually it won't hurt as much.  As long as you're realistic and know that if you truly loved this person then you will NEVER truly be over them.  It's been over 20 years for me.  And despite a 10 year marriage and two gorgeous girls, there still isn't a day that goes by tht i don't think about the first person I ever truly fell in love with.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I'm sorry to hear that.<br>  I have been there before. It is the worst thing that I have ever gone through in my life. I know it seems like you will never get over it, in fact you may never. But with time you will learn how to deal with it.<br>  I forget who sings this song, but;<br>  If its a broken part, replace it<br>  If its a broken arm then brace it<br>  if its a broken heart then face it<br>  hold your own<br>  know your name<br>  and go your own way<br>  everything will be fine|`|Fo5EdPAQaa	yes, I have felt that way. It hurts, that was almost 2 years ago, and I'll still think about it. I actually had to go to counseling. It really helped. Plus I had one good friend who would always be there for me, and then I had another who knew when to tell me to get over it. nice balance. I'm sorry honey. I feel your pain. Sometimes you do just need to lay down and cry.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	It's not unnatural to feel the pain of a broken heart and it certainly is not easy. The important thing is to take one day at a time and concentrate only on that day. When you wake up just say to yourself "I am going to make it through this day!" It will eventually get easier, even if it doesn't seem like it now. Keep you chin up. Obviously he isn't worth it. Good luck!|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	I went thru that and I still suffer when I see him becuase I wish things could have worked out between us and I worked hard for it to happen and all of that hard work went into nothing!  What helped me was to date more, even though I had to make myself date at times, it helped becuase I met different people and have made some good friends.  Try to go out and laugh more and just work on yourself and your career and try not to take guys too seriousely x|`|1epjqrflaa	Yes Lily, I think everyone as felt like this. In my situation we broke up and dated others and now after we grew some at age 28 we are living together and happier then we have ever been. Because we are soul mates, and if you and your ex are meant to be you will be together again when the time is right. I could not eat or smile for a month. Then when I had drank so much my liver hurt and cried so much my face was permanently soaked, I met other people. Dated, laughed again and slowly got back to me. It hurts and there is nothing anyone can do to make it go away. only time will heal your heart. Good luck and stay strong.|`|AA10818265	Yes, I have felt that way several times..I felt like life was over, the joy was gone, and I felt so empty...until I remembered that the feeling would eventually pass in time and I would eventually move on to a happy life. Since this is your first time going through this, you don't have the benefit of knowing that you will move on. So, from experience with being with "the one" just to have it all come to an end, I'm ensuring you that you will eventually get out of this funk. It hurts like mad but that's just what's normal when you lose someone you love.|`|RCpkdx4haa	It sucks. I've been there. I dated a woman for 3 years and she gutted me one day, revealing that she'd been cheating on me. I was a WRECK! I didn't date anyone else for 2 years!! I couldn't. I felt worthless, rejected, torn apart. And the pain didn't stop for a REALLY long time. When I was able to put myself back together, I found the love of my life. It took a while for me to trust her, but eventually it'll get there. Have some patience, and gravitate toward the people that do love you(friends, family). The best advice I can give would be what worked for me but I'm not sure it applies to you; try not to define yourself through your relationship. Don't let the person that you are with be the definition of who you are. Also, start a hobby that you've been meaning to try. You will keep your mind occupied and you will meet new people that share an interest with you. That doesn't mean try to find someone to replace your ex with someone else. Just meeting new people is exciting enough! Hang in there, you will feel better someday!|`|nsGPMenjaa	I have felt like that before. It is hard. But you just do what you have to do. You just keep moving forward. You just get up every day and go to work. You will not die from this! I used to tell myself when I felt like my heart was so heavy that I would die - "I'm not going to die!" Also, remember, no matter how bad you feel, or how much you think this is the worst thing he could ever do to you, just remember, EVERYone feels that way when this type of thing happens! Just keep telling yourself, when you are feeling sorry for yourself, "I'm not dying, my lungs and heart are still working!"
dFVztW7kaa	loners are usually amazing. i'm mostly too....i dunno...shy, maybe, to go up and talk to them, but a lot of the time i feel sorry for them.|`|7fXpLlhBaa	You have a good a chance as anyone to make friends and lead a happy, full life. Assert yourself more with the people around you, ask questions, talk about your life- really just strike up conversation with people you happy to see on a regular basis, people at work. Perhaps the reasons you have no friends is because you are waiting for people to come to you. Don't let that be the case- you make the "first move", you be the one to go up to that person and say "Hi, my name is so-and-so, How are you today?... or  " i happen to see you a lot and didn't think it was right that we didn't know eachother's name..." <br>  <br>  I think if you make the effort, people will certainly come around.  You're not a loner, you just haven't come out of your social shell yet. It will happen :-)|`|tXNfNTg2aa	I think loners are actually one of the best personality's you'd ever meet! I'm kind of a loner at times, but definitely not officially called one. I talk to loners though, I try to lighten up the mood and talk to everyone!! That's what you should do if you really want friends, just crack a couple jokes, exchange numbers, and you're in!<br>  But remember, just cause you don't have any friends doesn't mean you deserve to die, just ignore comments like that--THOSE people do! You must have family, try to make plans with them too! :)|`|A5p9g4tMaa	I understand were you are coming from man I am a college student and I don't have a lot of friends I have some but not a lot and I eat most meals alone manly because most of the people i have met at school are either druggies or alcoholics in my book. I don't want to be around that because my father and grandfather were both alcoholics. I don't judge people in your situation some people just don' want to talk well with others. try meting people online. I have about 300 people online and its easier then talking to people face to face. I even befriended a guy in Canada about 2 years ago and stayed with him when I had to go to Ottawa on business.|`|0GEcJFYNaa	I think that loners are either people who have had something happen to them in the past that makes them anti social or maybe they try making friends and always end up going to the wrong people, but they're all normal people just like us and a lot of people underestimate who they are and where they stand in life and for the mid 20's without friends probably just means they gave up on people and realized that they only need themselves to get anywhere in life|`|fs8wMQLFaa	I feel sorry for them. <br>  You should pursue an interest, and go out to public places often. Don't be afraid to mingle- and if you have similar interests, that's a very good start!<br>  I think loners are weird, in their own way and I feel bad for them, but they should go for it because often they're really good people.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Hugs Smiley|`|81SHaBnZaa	Loners are not always what they seem. I am not a loner although I might seem like one at times because I like to be alone sometimes. Usually you'd see me with friends but when I'm mad or sad I stay alone for a while. I hate when people say go to therapy or talk about your problems cuz I dont want to. People always need space so don't say someones a loner if you don't even know them
MzqZGvalaa	Look - I hate to say this to anyone, but I'm sorry I wasted my time reading your question.  You had me until the Phantom of the Opera and the new car!!  Get over yourself, you are a spoilt little person, who is counting every penny Daddy gives to your sister, keeping score, so you don't miss out on one dollar.  Look honey- not being able to go to NYC to see Phantom does not a neglected child make you, it makes you an ungrateful brat in my opinion.  I thought you were talking not enough money for food and stuff, but, come on, this is just petty.  If a new car for your 16th is even a possibility, then dead set, what are you moaning about?  I have to go now, because I donate time to people who cannot afford to put food on their kids plates, people who work really hard and will NEVER own a new car, never mind be given one by someone for no other reason than you were born!  People like you make me kinda sick.  Sorry, truth hurts.  Suppose you'll report me for abusing you as well hey?  Poor little darling.  UGH.<br>  BTW- you wanna talk child support?  If he gives anything at all count your blessings.  Dead beat Dads are a dime a dozen.  I get $A24.80 per month for one child who's father I was married to for 13 years and nothing for the other one who's dead beat Dad got himself locked up for attempted murder!!  Wanna swap - no? I didn't think so.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	You seem to be a very material type person.|`|BBTnM1p7aa	Well I think you should try to change his attitude. Like take him to your favorite places, ask him what's wrong or do things he likes to do (besides drink) Either than that just stay away and talk to your mom or you relatives about him and decide whether you can change him or not, or do something to help him realized what he has really done.|`|TnHl3Heoaa	wow that was alot to read<br>  What it all comes down to is your father isnt paying his child support. do you have any idea how common that is?<br>  Also, do you know that giving $400 a month to someone you dont even like (Im guessing your mother is hardly his favourite person) is not very high on a guys priority list? <br>  he should pay of course, that the price of unprotected sex. but unless your mother takes him to court he likely wont.|`|VygBNA0Waa	it wrong of you dad he doesnt deserve your time or love<br>  why dont you get a job so that way you have money of your own and you can save for a car and buy clothes and go out with friends with your own money <br>  that way you can have nice things and it will help your mum out because she wont have to buy clothes for you and you could have a bit save for  a car and that way you will have what you want and your mum will be happy because you want be missing out on things|`|f32cb1ac88adb7d78b600e293fee465aaa	Get your Mom to take him to court for child support so the state can set the weekly payment and even take it directly out of his check or bank account. And make sure she gets an order to make him pay half your college tuition. All she would have to do is google child support in your area to find out what she has to do. YOU don't need a lawyer. YOU don't need much money up front. (Maybe $50 to file but hey its worth it.)<br>  <br>  Your Dad needs to be responsible and not make your Mom pay for everything you need, or beg for the money.

DFJ9m4WKaa	The first few dates are kind of like ice breakers. They help you both to get a little more comfortable and familiar with each other. Unfortunately people are not mind readers. And the only way you'll know if this girl wants a commitment is if you ask her. <br>  <br>  However, a second date might be too soon to start talking about relationships. But after you have been dating for a few weeks, just plainly tell her that you like her and that you want to commit to her. Ask how she feels about a long term relationship. Just make sure you wait and don't rush into it on the second date.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Why set a limit? What`s the rush.<br>  She is going out with you.

Does she know it's a date or are you just hanging out? If she knows it's a date you shouldn't talk about becoming bf/gf. It will just happen naturally.

7gH7sgi6aa	I do not recommend the bus for a family.  You could get sleeper accommodations on an Amtrak Train.  Greyhound buses are shady and just substandard today.  Have your parents go to any Greyhound bus station and take a look around and decide if they want their family traveling like that.  Amtrak is fast and fun and exciting and affordable.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness
E7TkNO00aa	Of course he still loves her. Those 10 seconds that he gets to see her counts  much as if he didn't. Keep in mind that even if he only sees her for 10 seconds, he loves her very much and I'm sure he would want to spend every minute of his life with her. Don't feel sad, be happy.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Of course he would love her. He probably doesn't know her, but he would love her because she is part of him.  Fathers have to spend time with their kids to know what their personality's  are.  One day he will realize that money really doesn't buy happiness, just creature comforts.|`|aXYiOskmaa	he would or could love her exactly the same as if he'd spent every waking moment with her.more than life itself.<br>  my dad was gone all the time when i was little but he loved me and i knew it. he worked all those hours because he loved me,my mom and my siblings.|`|2102b6ebb00d225ec8e70793af7fce4baa	Of course he would always love her. She just might not have a real connection with him though. Maybe if he left her a note every morning she would think he cares for her.
dqMf8IeCaa	All the time and if it's not him it's me. I read one before, that when your in bed the way your body lays next to each other means something. So if you have and piece of skin touching each other that's a good thing. Its very comforting for me. I love and I know he does to.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	My husband would do this at times, but mostly when he was dreaming or having a nightmare about us and the he would want me close to him.  If you are not getting any sleep at all try to explain to him that you love him dearly and there are times when you really love to be close to him but there are also times when he need space to unwind in the bed and sleep soundly.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I do this to my wife and she feels much the same as you. I am a cuddler and she is not. We finally started compromising a bit. We cuddle before falling asleep and I get in a few cuddles throughout the night, but I don't become the human suction cup any longer. It was a hard transition for me at first, but I am just being conscious of her feelings on the matter.|`|AA11103763	Yup -- with him and three cats piled on me, it can be hard to sleep at times. But when they are not all with me, I can't sleep at all.  Talk to him about finding sleeping positions that allow for lots of contact and let you breathe as well.|`|GXOy8rjqaa	Yes to all that, my husband can't sleep unless he is touching me.  I have been married 11 years, now I can't sleep unless he is holding me.|`|nbm1RDoZaa	Yes, but I can breathe. <br>  <br>  He doesn't really have long arms, I do.

I pray my husband would do those things..... enjoy it while it lasts! : )|`|0Id85yiYaa	no|`|f9sL3WgQaa	My current husband doesn't even touch me in bed..but I can tell you my last husband would hold me so tight I couldn't breath.. It was because he kept thinking I was going to sneak out of bed and go somewhere, get on the computer or call someone.. he was so paranoid that he would literally sleep super tight so if I even tried to move..he would know.|`|asxqampCaa	Another one who is ungrateful for what she has.<br>  <br>  Don't worry - you'll push him away, push him away, push him away - then a year from now you'll be on here pissing and whining  - "Wahhh! He never touches me! Why?"|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	No, but I'm guilty of that. He calls me a leech.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Yes, and I treasure it.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	I don't do this to my fiance. We have been living together for 5 years and it is just too damn hot for all that cuddling stuff. Every now and then is fine but we gonna have to open a window.|`|AA12321514	That is very romantic. I too don't let her sleep that easily. I like to hold her so tight and then keep on talking and talking. Her and I both understand that it is gonna last forever!!!|`|AA10032971	You already have a 'pot of gold.' Congratulations on obtaining this status in your life. I wish you ongoing success in your life. Peace!|`|2YBwc4LFaa	Yes and I absolutely love it. There are times when it's hard to breathe but I manage to survive and if he weren't doing it, I probably wouldn't get any sleep at all.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	I dont blame you. I need my own sleeping space.<br>  <br>  We have a snuggle then say goodnight ...but sometimes we hold hands through the night which is nice!|`|ZEitfScGaa	lol...I do that to my wife and she is always pushing me away because she gets too hot.<br>  I guess you should be lucky he does|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	No, because I wrap myself burrito style and I will kick if I get too hot.|`|PbESvbu6aa	nope baby in between
3zdWInrdaa	I recently did the same thing.....everyone LOVED the invites and no one seemed to care that they were a little difficult to get out, but a secret is to roll them around a pencil so you get them nice and tight so they fit in the bottle and make a small scroll easier to get out.  Most of my guests found it to be quite fun to try and get the invite out.  We used plastic bottles so it was a little harder to just "break" them as others suggested, but using a pencil with an eraser on it, stick it INSIDE the scroll and use it to pull it out....it works GREAT!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|D9ufwiMXaa	my cousin did the same thing for her invitations and they taped a little piece of string to the inside of the bottle lid and to the invite to help get the invitation out.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah it's going to be a pain for your guests to get the stuff out of the bottle unless they break it or use tweezers. and it's going to cost you $$$ to mail all those!  and how are you going to fit a SASE inside there for them to send back their reply card?|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	yes!  its seems to be a new trend - we had to break the darned bottle to get the invitation out - but maybe there are different types of 'bottles' available - its a cute idea!<br>  wishing you a very happy wedding!
Br3s0zPvaa	no it's not too soon, don't worry if it's not ment to be you'll know ;P|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Well it's not like your total strangers.You have known each other for some time.Still you should get to know each others personality before you commit to bf & gf Tht should be evident after a few "dates".
fHfVRcqbaa	First of all, just to address that last part of your question--looks do not warrant more or less love.  If he loved her, and not you, then you could look like Claudia schiffer, and she could look like Roseanne, and it wouldn't matter to him, he would still love her and not you.<br>  <br>  Having said that, of course he is still going to have some love for this woman.  They have children together and he married her for a reason, and vowed his life to her.  Whether they divorce or not, there is bound to be love there, even if it is only love for her as the mother of his kids.<br>  <br>  From now on, don't ask unless you have thought out how you will react to any answer he gives you.  This is not a big deal, or at least it shouln't be.  I wouldn't put limitations on his relationship with her, unless you feel it is becoming grossly inappropriate and threatening your marriage.  Right now, I just think you are jealous and probably surprised.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I still love my ex-husband, but not in a sexual way.  I always hope for the best for him and his new wife.  We don't talk but maybe twice a year, and it is always friendly, but very respectful.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I understand where you are coming from and how you are feeling about the ex and the phone calls but on the other hand I understand what the hubby is saying. He loves her as a friend and rather people believe this or not there are those who can love each other and not be in love or romantically involved. I think you have nothing to worry about. I know the jealous feelings that flow through your body also. I believe your husband is just wanting to be there for the kids and nothing else. Besides if something else happens then that is his loss and you finally know the one you married.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	Well what do you think.....he got married to this woman in front of god and everyone and promised to love her forever eternal for better or worse.  <br>  Is your man a guy that keeps or breaks promises?|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	I guess that statement could come as a little shock.<br>  <br>  But it just Sounds like he is at ease with the situation. Holds no grudges etc ..... which is really good. His ex is the mother of  his kids, I think its quite nice that he speaks of her in a nice way, especially when there is so much bitterness in other divorced people.<br>  <br>  Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill. If you fuss about it, then it will cause bugger problems.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I think you should let this go...She was the mother of his children, the air has taken YEARS to clear with them and kids to some degree...She's older - he's older - they obviously share some regrets and were I you?  I'd let it go and continue to be supportive.  He sounds like a pretty good man, may be regrets the way he did it, but doesn't sound sorry he did, perhaps just a little guilty.  It isn't up to you to dictate the calls or how long they speak, is it?  Nothing worse than a jealous 2nd wife, and although you profess not to be?  Methinks you are just a tad if you are honest with yourself, because its about TIME he spends conversing with her that is taken from you...So let this go and be a wise woman...I feel very sorry that his kids obviously, care little about him - you reap what you sow and he has and he knows it and he probably feels sad inside for the loss...and always will.  There are some things you don't get back in life unless the "other side" comes to terms as well - his children.  It doesn't appear they have and may never...wouldn't that make you sad if it happened to you and you handled a breakup perhaps foolishly and/or insensitively?  Methinks it would if you have half a heart...<br>  <br>  Let it go dear...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	He loves her like a sister, not a lover, so don't make a big deal about it. He's with YOU.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	I wouldn't make a big deal out of it like you are|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	that is normal, and I think it is not that he loves her but rather loves the memories of happier times when they were together, and he may well feel guilty for having left her, but he is with you now so don't worry about it and make a mountain out of a molehill.  If it bothers you, just try to ignore it and things will be fine.  remember that he is there with you for a reason.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	It's normal.  I don't know anyone that's divorced with kids that doesn't hold some sort of affection for their ex.  I mean come on, they have history and kids together...He isn't interested in her any other way than she is the mother of his children.  Don't sweat it...|`|cmjrtcQZaa	He is going to have some kind of feelings for his ex. I mean hello, they do have kids together. My husband has kids from another woman and i know he doesnt like what she does and how she raises the kids but i also know he still cares about her because that is his kids mom. I do not feel threatened at all because i know he would never go back to her..
V2qyE68Jaa	shes not worth trying to get back if she said that..dont keep thinking about it she will soon come back

y9CgveCGaa	I believe in letting the guy bring up marriage.  If he doesn't and you think it is time he should, it probably means he has doubts and isn't going to do it.  Time to find another one.|`|0Id85yiYaa	b/c it's important to them, i guess|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I've never had an issue with that myself, and I always brought up marriage very openly.  I can see not talking about when the relationship is still brand new, but it seems weird to me to be in a long-term relationship and not be able to discuss your plans for marriage at all.   If a man is being scared by these conversations, I assume that one of two things is happening.  1.  The woman isn't talking about marriage, she's pressuring for a proposal.  If she isn't willing to accept answers like, "I don't think it's smart to get married until we're more financially stable" without getting angry and upset, then he's not going to want to talk about it.  Or 2.  The guy doesn't want to get married or think about marriage.  He wants to always leave open the option of leaving the relationship, but knows she would leave if he ever told her that, so instead he just tries to avoid the discussion altogether and gets mad if she brings it up.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	It's okay to share what your ultimate goal in a relationship might be, as long as it is not specific to that person early in the relationship. It saves a lot of time if the other person has no intentions of ever marrying. That being said, the specifics of marrying your current date should not even be on the table until you reach that level. Too many people try to rush a relationship and it doesn't work. These types of women have insecurity issues and need to know NOW rather than letting things develop naturally.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	my husband was privileged to marry me just like i am privileged to have him as my husband.  if he didn't feel that way i wouldn't marry him! guys are scared of commitment when they don't want to commit.  if he feels like he is with the right girl he will be the first to bring it up.  <br>  if the guy you are dating doesn't see a future with you, its time to stop waisting time and move on.  <br>  that being said, no one should talk commitment until at least a couple of month into relationship.  this goes for both guys and girl.  if a guy (and it has happened) asked me to marry him 2 month into the relationship i would think he is a bit psycho and run like the wind.|`|1Xt7KLiMaa	Suppose for some/most men its a strange thought to think that they will only be with the one person for the rest of their lives. <br>  Then again, you have women who are like that too. I think those women are in just a equal if not greater number but are simply overshadowed and those men are spoken about more.
qNMfaJ4Raa	You have plenty of time before thirty to get a college degree and find a good job.<br>  <br>  Save money before marriage/having kids and you won't have to worry so much about it later.|`|GvamTVqAaa	What's the question?|`|AA10818265	Financial trouble often cause relationships to fail. You shouldn't aim to be poor just because other people are. You don't know what goes on behind closed doors. You don't know the struggles those young families face. To plan a family when you have no money is just irresponsible. If you are married and you have a husband can support the family on his income alone so that you can stay home and raise your children, then you would be in a good place.|`|SHARt1k3aa	That's an ignorant comment.  My son was 22 and had a baby, he had a job, he got an apartment, he never ever went on welfare.  Once the baby was old enough his girlfriend got a job and they are doing fine!  What an ignorant person.  Both of them went to an accelerated college and have A's, but they don't have Masters and Bachelors.  What an idiot to say that to you.  If it weren't for the blue color workers this country would fall to the ground.|`|AA12382198	It's almost a luxury  now for married with children couples are able to live on one income.<br>  <br>  It's possible.....but very hard. <br>  <br>  Another thing to think about.....you can plan your future....but you have to be prepared for the unexpected.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	First, it is very hard to raise a family on min. wage.  Mostly you have to do w/ out.  Whatever you want..it doesn't matter!  You don't like your job?  Too bad..you will HAVE to work it to provide for your baby!  You want new shoes or clothes?...Nope...your baby comes first and need to see the doctor!<br>  <br>  You are put second.  Families go w/ out and they get by and sometimes need federal assistance.  You probably won't be able to afford health insurance because it is costly.  You will need to have excellect budget skills.<br>  <br>  I know women who get min wage and raise their families but, honestly if you're still able to go and persue your education and develop a skill or trade. If you can do that in something you enjoy you will be happier.  You'll have less financial stress, can do something you enjoy, and get home every night with a well-being you've provided for your family and community.  <br>  <br>  If you do have kids it is more cost efficient (besides other benefits) if you or their father stay home and you or the father is the bread winner.  This saves day-care costs.  So, you really will need help raising your kids with you working full time.  <br>  <br>  That is my idea about it.  I've also read the first year of baby's life is $10,000 and that is without complications.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Yes, it is true that people get married young and have children, but they STRUGGLE. Most of them have to get food stamps or go on welfare because they can't support their family. Or they have to leave their child at daycare because BOTH parents have to work full time. I don't think it's smart to have a family before you finish school because you might never go back. Not only that school is expensive and if you can't get any aid, what's going to happen? I think it can be done, but considering the current state of things you need to make sure that you can handle it.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I am not sure where the exact question is here, but I would agree with your friedn that you need a certain amount of security before raising children. You don't need to be wealthy, but steady employment and roots set down is a good start. <br>  <br>  Most people who have kids early do not plan it out and just have to learn to survive, but if you are planning to have kids then you need to plan on how to take care of them. Welfare should never be a solution for any Mother. It should be a last resort.
VJNLkJT0aa	I'd let the bf know he needs to change his password and that you personally have no hard feelings toward him. Tell him that you and the husband regret the difficult breakup, but to keep the peace you really don't want to get involved and complicate matters. You really don't know what happened, and there are for sure more than one version of events. Tell the bf that he's always welcome to stop by but then limit any contact unless he initiates it or you send a holiday greeting. He might not want the contact or may need it. Leave it up to them, and step back out of the way or you'll be the one that's the target.|`|Fc5wU2R1aa	Do what you think is right. Did the ex boyfriend ever do anything to you or your husband that would cause you not to want to continue the friendship? More than likely this is your sis in law's attempt to dictate behavior. <br>  I once dated a guy who took me to his favorite out of the way restaurant. It became my favorite also. When we broke up he informed me that I could no longer go there, because it had been "his" first. Please! It's still my favorite and my husband and I go there every week|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Since she called the cops, maybe you can ask them if there is indeed a restraining order against him, for her and the rest of the family.<br>  <br>  Other than that - tell him, if you see him, to change his passwords - or he could sue her for hacking / illegal opening of personal mail.<br>  <br>  If she is such a drama queen, the ' she is hiding something ' theory could very well be true.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Stop interfering in your sister in laws life, you had no right to get in touch with her ex. Clearly you hate her and wanted to get one up on her but remember she is your husbands sister and you shouldn't be trying to cause trouble!|`|Z68zEZmmaa	sometimes it's better just to not get involved. Just look the oppisite way!|`|7d2928f852362ce15ddfc514db718d5daa	i have a sister like this too... <br>  there is no way to win...|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	The fact she isnt talking about it convinces me she did something to cause the breakup and doesnt want anyone to know what she did. You are an adult, her ex is an adult, so unless you want another parent telling you what you can or cannot do you should do what you want. Follow your own gut instincts, they are usually right. If you want to remain friends with him that is your business, not hers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and I agree with the person saying tell him she is checking his email. Email hacking is illegal and you might tell her she could do 6 months jail time for that if she is entering his email without his permission. And tell him to change his password.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	her ex probably needs somebody to talk to so you should find out what happened
ruczpWrGaa	Its not so much him.  its the drama his ex wife causes.  she causes it the most whenever he helps her with anything.  so i guess i hate when he helps her.  but he likes to help people, i love that about him.|`|uuMCGT9taa	i love that he always has to be holding my hand or have his arm around me <br>  <br>  i hate that he lags it on stuff and doenst work at the moment|`|UjajMHH4aa	i really love the fact that we had so much passion for one another...<br>  <br>  <br>  and i really hate the fact that he broke up with me last night. ><|`|An2KCMnwaa	I really hate that I don't have one
SZvJVM2yaa	hell no dude even if she does split with you and u buy a ticket always keep the ticket with you and always buy one the same amount and if in case that one wins you can keep it money is more important then friendship and women money unlike friends and women does not screw you over ever it helps you|`|t1WueC9aaa	If Feel Sad ;(|`|CPZA5qrGaa	That's one FANTASTIC  F_*KING  QUESTION!<br>  It's all what is in your conscience.<br>  For me and my conscience...Yes, I would still share 50/50 because that is my friend. My word is my bond.<br>  Whether he/she didn't pay.<br>  I would hope my friend would share with me 50/50, but usually that is not likely to happen.<br>  Only you can make that call. There is no right or wrong answer for this one.|`|Xc3ukGowaa	Have you been buying tickets together for a long time or just once in a while? Has she always paid for her share before? If you have been buying tickets together on a regular basis I believe it is only fair to divide the winning ticket. How would you feel if for just one time you didn't get the chance to pay your share and got cut out of any winnings.If this is hypothetical I would sit down with your friend and write out the rules together, sign it and each have a copy. Maybe you can establish a fund where you each contribute a set amount each month to purchase tickets--that way maybe a payment won't be missed and nobody gets hurt. In the long run how much does this friendship mean to you --would you prefer to lose a friend over the ticket.
XZwkLeZ9aa	He's fooling around w/ this other girl.  I would give him an ultimatum -- don't ever talk to this girl again or you will never talk to him again.  I think it's disrespectful that he cheated on you with this same girl, and he's STILL seeing her "as a friend", and tell you to believe it or not.  If the table was turned around, and you cheated on him w/ another guy, how would he feel if you were still friends w/ this guy and going out to sushi and ponds w/ him?  He'd be jealous out of his mind AND feel insecure even if you asked him to marry him.  This situation just won't work.  He has to choose you or to his "friend."  And if she's just a friend, it won't be that hard, will it?  But if he's in a long distance w/ him, then you'll just have to believe his words if he chooses you.  But at least, next time you see any signs of her on his FB, you have clear evidence that he's lying.  To tell you the truth, he sounds like a liar.  He will only keep hurting you.  Maybe he'll change when you guys can be together.  If that's going to happen in the future, maybe I'll hold on.  If not, you're in a bad situation and I feel for you.  If you can't break-up w/ him but know you should, give yourself TIME (3-6 mos) to ask yourself, what do you get from being w/ him.  Take a long time until you feel alright to leave him.  Take care, hon.|`|ImrJkn1waa	Girl all that i can say is that it your life if he makes u happy stay and i can see that u love him so just try your best and see if  u can curve him to  be the man that u want him to be okay sweety|`|JKjy4Nv1aa	Maybe they are just friends? Guys and girls can hang out together without it meaning something romantic.|`|GeimyUi6aa	booooooring|`|JaupP5WXaa	It would be right if you broke up with him.. so you don't get hurt DX You wouldn't want that! He broke your heart so you brake his:)|`|yt8KccD9aa	meet up with him when he gets home and tell him how you feel and if he doesnt change this last time, then end it. im sorry hes being so stupid you deserve much better :) good luck!!! xooxx|`|whFHzbvuaa	why ask us what you should do with him if youre not gonna listen to what we say?<br>  <br>  the obvious answer is that you should leave him...|`|Ry4r4ycwaa	Sorry.

Don't let him tell you they are just friends....it is very obvious that they are more.  Don't let your emotions interfere with your good judgment.  You will only be hurt over and over again.  Find someone who shows you more respect.  Break ties with this guy.  If you can't do it....then at least tell him you want to date other guys as well.

WL6FP0F3aa	First off, relax. Chill out bro, it's just a girl, not a monster.<br>  You don't need to make your move, moves should just happen, in moments, they should not be planned, only executed when necessary.<br>  You will know when it's time, and do not be blind to the it aint happening look on her face, if you see it, back off.<br>  <br>  You really like her, then it should come out in how you talk to her, how you treat her, and how you touch her.<br>  <br>  Dont ever start off anything with I dont know. That tells me you have no confidence. Like I said before, confidence is the game. You hear the term, that dudes got a mouthpiece? It means he can spit game?<br>  <br>  This term in itself is ridiculous, the mouthpiece is an excuse made up by people who lack confidence in aww of those who have a whole lot of it. I remember a lot of people used tell me what a mouth piece I had going on, but its all BS, I am real, I am honest, I am loyal, and I used confidence to run my attitude. You need to do the same, and you will get what you want.<br>  <br>  You need to wait if the time is wrong, and if the time is right, you need to attack. Girls dig that sh*t too. Say at the end of the night, you want to kiss her, if you are not sure, don't do it, just give her a hug and say good night, but if you know you got it, dont waste time, and take it.<br>  <br>  Passion is everything, but keep the slobber to a minimum, and don't take her on a cheesy *** date either. Do something most dudes are too "manly" to do. Take her like mini golf, or bowling, and activity is fun, but you have to follow it up with some chill lets talk time, like coffee, but not starbucks, thats cheesy, a nice hole in the wall coffee spot does it. No movies, you cannot talk, she can't get to know you.<br>  <br>  E-mail me, go to my profile later and contact me there, I changed it so you can. Tell me what you plan on doing, and I will hook you up with some advice. If you are interested that is.|`|F3mKSH1Zaa	Trust me when I say this. Girls just want you to be yourself, if you start trying to say things that aren't you and then you get in a relationship, she will be dating a guy she didn't fall in love with. <br>  <br>  My Philosophy is to tell her that you like her, and you should make the first move... trust me, girls aren't as weird as we are, and if we make the first move they aren't gonna push us off and tell us to get away.|`|PYBda7Taaa	Ok soooo I'm not going to pretend to be a relationahip expert because, trust me, I'm not! I don't even have a boyfriend right now, but I will try and help you. That does sound good, but try and throw in a few compliments to show her were youre going with this. Give her the compliments as a warning so see can warn you if she will be umcomtrable.That way she can give you warnings if she doesn't feel the same way. Also read her body langauge and facials that way if shes giving off bad signs then I would postpone the whole ordeal. That will save you both a lot of trouble and will stop you're whole declaration a little less abrupt. Also if she says she feels the same way don't give her time to change her mind. Ask her to hang out with you so thats not the last time you see eachother that night. Another tip is tell her that if she doesn't feel the same way then you would still like to be friends. That may give you a chance to change her mind. But dont be to forward b/c that gets old really fast. Just go back to being a good "buddy" unless/until she indications she feels the same way.|`|XtmPYHyJaa	say you dont have to say anything if you dont want, i just wanted you to knowit will make the presure go down alot

Zfl7GkjOaa	Yeah. Talk with your parents about a way that you can pay them back. You will probably have to put more money into it, since you most likely will have to take it somewhere to get it cleaned out and have an antivirus program installed.

jOmbgjLUaa	If it were me, I would definitely have to like the guy to act like that. But as I don't personally know her, I can't say for sure. Some girls I know would have to be head over heels in love in order to act like that, others are only interested, and some are only interested in toying with the guy. But, if you've known each other for that many years and are still flirting, I'll say she's pretty interested then. Either way, I think you have a good chance with her =)|`|66fMJo6raa	...........................................<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  <br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .........................................|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Yeah, but how does she react when you kiss her.  That will tell you everything you need to know.|`|Ry4r4ycwaa	Dude!!! She likes you!!! This sounds like me haha even the dad part she's just trying to either tell you she wants to go out and her dad said yeah she can date or she doens't give a crap what her dad thinks and is trying to hang out with you as much as she can.|`|DXvsemWtaa	she most definitely likes you. If she has increased her time with you, she really wants to get to know you more and show you more about herself.|`|dCOLRrK3aa	that's abit of a no brainer!|`|KZfYzhZRaa	she so likes you go for it!|`|oJAu1T8caa	i think she likes you back. she wants to show even if her dad dont let her have a boyfriend that doesnt stop her form liking you. Alot of girls dads dont alow that but of course its still her feelings and he cant change that. When you flirt with somebody for soo long and dont get bored you should know she likes you. But yes even if i didnt like a guy i would act like this. but i still think she likes you back ;D|`|vQG1pBd6aa	Looks like she likes you bro, but do take into consideration that her father is protective of her. She is younger then you and most likely inexperience with dating. Even though she likes you just have respect for her and her fathers perspective, eventually (if she still likes you and you her) you guys would start dating.|`|ac3HAiOKaa	It sounds like she likes you, but I'm a little confused.  Her dad lets her party but not date?  <br>  <br>  And... when I was 15 if I wanted to go out with a boy I found away... and Dad never knew.<br>  <br>  Maybe she was nervous before but likes you more now.  <br>  <br>  I would try asking her out again... if she does like you she'll find a way around pop...|`|JKAcdlZVaa	I'm 15, and I think she likes you. But, some of the girls at my school flirt with guys just to get them all over her, even if they don't like the guy. If she flirts with a lot of other guys, then maybe she's just obsessed with guys at the time. Honestly, I think she likes you, though.|`|sKYPWxTmaa	hmm, i think she likes you but the thing with her dad might be in her way. ask her to go someplace that she would be anyway. like a concert with her friends so her dad doesn't know about you. then see what she says and go with it.|`|tNAZ9Qr7aa	As long as you're sure she's flirting with you and not just talkative, she probably likes you. I have no idea what you're going to do about the dad though|`|m1r1PnJfaa	i don't get it what did she act like|`|LdoV3Mltaa	ok well i think she is definitly interested. try asking her out again, and try to maybe suck up to her dad in order for him to say yes. (i dont recomend u do this unless u r kinda sneaky and a little rebelish )but u cud tell her dad ur going some where as friends and go on a date but idk thats kinda lying.. so idk but i think she is interested and if you go on you tube and type in "does she like me" by the wing girls, it tells you what a girl does that makes it obvious they like you!!<br>  <br>  answer mine please!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhP63qIj9yUXeTPmO.pjDHPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225203949AAS5pVB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  hope i helped good luck!<br>  :P|`|K9NLPzxGaa	she defiantly likes you back, she wouldn't just randomly be at the same party as you lol. anyway if you want to go out with her or kiss or whatever than try telling her to tell her dad shes just going out with some friends, then he wont be suspicious.
5YKkrPZ8aa	Best thing to do is laugh it off and not make it a big deal, if you do that will make it even more awkward! So next time you get a chance just be like "hahah sooo I was thinking about it and  I'm sorry I got worked up about that I thought they were saying horrible things about me! and sorry about my sister by the way!"<br>  <br>  probably would be be best to say this in person its very hard to interpt things when your on AIM. but you can always add a :) to let her know your intentions are good and that you mean it in a non sarcastic way|`|wJGQtHuhaa	So whats the question?|`|mK1qUhkqaa	wow<br>  how immature of your friend<br>  she's just jealous of you and has low self esteem<br>  <br>  just go to her and be like "umm why would you say that to me? you know i'm very conscious with my work and stuff.." and see what she says.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|sr4BAblpaa	Ask her what she seriously expected...<br>  Big sisters can be very protective at times and although it was immature of her to go curse off your friend because she didn't tell you what was really going on, it's not your fault and she shouldn't take it out on you...but she also shouldn't expect you to be all happy when she knows you know she was lieing about it.  It's not fair to you.  So just try to talk it out with her - she obviously saw you as a gullable target - try to work on not being so vulnerable.  It will help (: good luck!|`|9mcpblG4aa	talk to her about it. if she is lying then it was her fault. just c how she felt. good luck.|`|z6DIHEG3aa	get over it that's not serious at all.... loser|`|DfFq0N3Xaa	simply tell her that there are some things that you shouldn't joke about.<br>  tell her that you didn't find it funny.<br>  and that she needs to learn to be mature...<br>  if you want to be on the offensive.<br>  <br>  if you would rather not cause unnecessary rifts, i would take out the "maturity comment" and say that if she messes around with someone else, things may not be so controlable.<br>  tell her that you never know how the other person is going to react, and that she needs to learn where the line is drawn.|`|fZpxUxFOaa	well what you should do is talk to her about it first. ask her questions and see why she would go that far. and just make up and be friends because you dont want anyone to hate you|`|7kbrbFxPaa	Just tell her that your sister was saying that! And genuinly appologize. If she is a true friend, she will forgive.|`|SajEIksaaa	try joking around a lot! that's what me and my friend did after lots of awkwardness.|`|U7VlmXfQaa	just apologize and say ur sister shouldnt hav done that|`|UHQGlOPlaa	first of all shes not your friend to do that.|`|ChLyqWyoaa	wow get over it. this is the dumbest **** i've ever heard.
sriByWZBaa	i think ur actually normal. You sound normal by playing sports, doing pretty good in school, and lots of teenagers get emotional and crazy sometimes too. It's totally normal. I don't see how you are weird but you shouldn't worry about other people. Focus on school and being yourself!
Em00pBjTaa	Just tell her that you would never want anyone talking bad about you, so her joke upset her. And then tell her about your sister. like apologize for your sisters over reaction. One day you'll look back at the joke and laugh about it.<br>  Don't make it more awkward than it is either. If you are thinking "This is so awkward" it will be even more awkward than it really is. Just act like normal and laugh it off, like "Hey. sorry about the other night. i just got really upset when i thought you were telling the truth and my sister overheard and was trying to stand up for me. I hope she didn't scare you too much." Make it seem casual.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. :)|`|7ko9czaaaa	tell her that was not funny, and she could hurt me and the teacher.|`|Sfy1SnL4aa	First of all if she really is your friend then she shouldn't do that to you...it's ok to joke around but there's a limit to that....tell her that dont like it when she says things about you to others|`|NzuQnd5Naa	it really depends on what kind of person she is, like if you really know she was joking, then yeah put it behind you two.<br>  <br>  But if she was just a b**** then, let it go or seek revenge.|`|v2jxHGg5aa	ok so yeah, she may have just done that to make you mad.  don't be, just say o what evs, if it's big they'll come to me.  i shouldn't have to come to them|`|8gYGNnNzaa	just be like.. sorry my sister flipped on you. and try to laugh about it. not in a mean way that she thinks your laughing at her.

AWOqn9SKaa	Possibly yes, he could have feelings for you OR he can just treat you as a friend. Does he act that way to other girls? I' m a guy and i would sometimes say random stuff to any girl its just pops out. But doesn't mean i like them cause i like to joke around.<br>  If you really wanted to know if he likes you when you catch him staring at you, just simply stare at him and keep eye contact. See what he does, like all the sudden stare somewhere else, starts to look nervous, if he starts blushing then that's a definite yes...<br>  Yes a girls stare can get a guy feeling all weird inside if he likes her.<br>  Good Luck finding out!|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Yes boys tend to say stupid or random things to girls they like just to talk to you.

mbvpWNMeaa	It sounds like the real reasons for this divorce go deeper than money.  Otherwise, he would not be treating her this way, especially over her spending money on medical bills that are as much his responsibility as hers.  It sounds like the kind of power struggle that goes on between people who deeply resent and do not respect each-other.  The behavior you describe from your father is outrageous.  However, I have no idea what else has gone on between them, so there could be fault on both sides.<br>  <br>  By the way, sheloves is right.  He can't take her name off of a joint account without her signature (unless he forged her name) so you may very well be misinformed about how this all went down.|`|jdRKZe18aa	They both need a lesson in what Equal Partners means.... and BOTH need to be reminded it sounds like to me.

Inform your leasing office asap|`|kPnVISdhaa	You should seriously get out of that house.

XZwkLeZ9aa	Wow, that's f***ed up.  He made you shocked and worried for the kicks?  He sounds really immature, stupid, and unemotional.  I would've reacted just like you and hung up, he deserved it.  Then to make a light of it, it's no big deal, w/o acknowledging that he hurt you is a double fault.  So he messed up 2x in my view.  But if you really like him, I would give him another try.  But i think you'll be disappointed a few more times until he changes, so hang on for the ride.  You sound like a caring person, and he sounds like the opposite.  It'll be harder for you, but if you really really like him, give him another chance, IF he apologizes.

He's an idiot.  But of course, I've done something like that too to see how a girl would react.  Okay, to be honest, he is seeking attention.  He pretty much wants you to know that you'll be sad if anything ever happened to him....

8Zk3t6yAaa	He is definately too clingy and too attached already...he seems like one of those people who fall in love fast or maybe he just needs attention. It could also be that you are the best looking or nicest woman he has ever been with and he wants to show you that or reassure himself you are still there by constanty pressing himself on you. If you really like him then tell him he is a little too close too soon and if he wants to make it work as much as you do then calm down a little...if you really aren't that interested then just ditch him....it could be an act...your gut is always best judgment.
eXpZD0vlaa	A big smile and look directly into his eyes for a fraction of second longer than usual.  And give everyone else normal smiles/looks.  While talking to him or saying goodbye, touch him lightly and briefly on the arm.  Work it into the conversation somehow.  He'll start wondering.  Whether he does something about it is another question altogether.|`|d09851fraa	To be honest, just smile at him everytime you walk by him. Wave at him. He would probably start talking to you.

L0Gwa10paa	truthfully speaking, the decision is between the bride and groom as to the location of the biggest day of your lives. the distance also gives guests an opportunity to build up their excitement of the coming grand event and gives the bride and groom some of the most romantic moments and down time before the festivities take flight. enjoy the most beautiful day of your lives because after all.. it is your day!! godspeed and may your day be filled with joy.|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	Keep it where you want it, If the guest really want to come to both they will others will choose to come to one or the other, and not both, this is your day soooo do what you like.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	40 mins isn't too far.  don't kill yourself to get to the cocktail hour tho- you can have all the champagne you can drink in the limo while you're driving around to your photo sites after the ceremony!  then it makes your grand entrance into the reception more special because no one has seen you at the hotel beforehand.  no one expects you to be at the cocktail hour, it's assumed it's just to keep guests entertained while the wedding party runs around for pics.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	40 minutes is a bit of a stretch.  like, its  going to take them 40 min to get to the place, then theres still cocktail hour before the actual reception.  thats an hour and 40 minute wait!  and given that pictures do take a while, and then depending on where their taken you have to drive 40 min or more to get to the reception place, they could be waiting even longer!<br>  <br>   id deffinatly try for the closer church if you can.  your looking at a 2 hour or longer gap between ceremony and reception otherwise|`|RKsn5dD4aa	My good friends had a reception site 40min away from the church.  It was ok but, sucked to get home that night.  I didn't mind because they are awesome friends.  However i had to drive 2 of the grooms friends back to their hotel at 1 in the am.  That was the HORRIBLE part!|`|CoiOMTiBaa	I would personally be annoyed if the reception site was 40 minutes away. I think that's a little excessive, especially for those who have already traveled a long way.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	30 mins max. Some people won't mind driving 45-60 mins but alot of people say that they won't drive that far.|`|AA11312653	Sorry, but this is going to harsh. Please don't take it personally.<br>  <br>  " ... I know that you must give yourself time for pictures and it would be nice to at least show my face at the cocktail hour ..."<br>  <br>  Perhaps The Wedding Industy tells you that you must do this, but etiquette tells you that it is dreadfully rude. From the time your guests arrive until the end of the reception, their comfort and convenience are your resposibility. There is no polite way for hosts to say "We're taking a little time out for something more important than you, so just entertain yourselves and we'll pick up where we left off in an hour or so." A cocktail hour does make up for neglecting guests in this way; Jack Daniels is no substitute for the host. <br>  <br>  "... I know it's 'Our Day" but at the same time I don't want my guests to be put off ..."<br>  <br>  Any advice along the lines of "It's YOUR day and YOU should have things YOUR way" should be firmly ignored. It is also the guests' day and the families' day. Marriage is an important milestone in ones life, but no milestone is so important that it excuses subjecting your guests to avoidable discomfort and inconvenience. <br>  <br>  If virtually all of your guests actually have rooms at this hotel, so that total driving will be hotel to ceremony round trip, this would work. But consider that for most guests you plan will probably mean first a drive to the ceremony, then a drive to the hotel, and finally the drive home. That adds up to more driving than celebrating, more drudgery than festivity. <br>  <br>  Please rethink your plans with more consideration for guests. More and more people are opting to send gifts AFTER the honeymoon, and base their generosity on how pleased they were with your party. In my own case, one nephew received 60+ piece set of fine crystal ware while another received a 24 peice set plain glassware. You see how the thoughtfulnes that goes around eventually comes around. <br>  <br>  I'm not angry with you dear bride, I am angry that The Wedding Industry has, for the sake of securing advertising monies from photography vendors, so corrupted popular ideas of propriety and courtesy to guests. You are an innocent victim of this vicious Industry's misinformation. Congrats and best wishes.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	I would get married at the site closer to the reception.<br>  <br>  Could you schedule a day with your photographer to do pictures at the other site?  Or perhaps use that site when and if you have children for their baptism.<br>  <br>  What you are proposing would be over a two hour commute back and forth and I just think that is unacceptable.|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	In all honesty I'd either find a reception hall closer to the church, or a church closer to the reception area.  If I were a guest I'd be put off by an extra 40 min drive (because who knows how far some of the guests have to travel just to attend the wedding regardless!)<br>  <br>  I hope it works out.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	Personally if the reception was fourty minutes away I would probably just attend the ceremony and send a gift with someone who was actually going the reception.  I would say you might lose quite a few guest from the ceremony to the reception...Find somewhere closer to the church.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	A 40 minute drive would seem the maximum acceptable distance.<br>  Less drive time would surely be more convenient for all involved. but if the church of choice has a lot of meaning I'd stick with it.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	I'd go with the closer place.  Its the marriage and how much you get to enjoy the day that matters.  Not where the vows were said.|`|mWIIjKUSaa	I think less people will show up if the reception is 40 mins away.. but you could save on food that way...lol but really.. I had one photography tell me that she could do the brides pictures early.. like about a week or so before the wedding you and your brides maids would go get your pictures done in your gown.. then the day of the wedding you wouldn't have to take so many pictures... you have to do  a trial run on your hair anyway.... its just a thought.. I thought it sounded kinda crazy, but she said people do it all the time... anyway  good luck and I hope you have a happy life together|`|qsLhVZd8aa	Personally, I wouldn't do it.  I would go just to the wedding and skip the reception if I had to drive an hour to it.|`|xwZV9jgPaa	I don't think it would be a big deal for your guests to be at the reception for an hour before u arrive...my suggestion would be to have dinner be served before you get there so they can be eating instead of just waiting for you and the wedding party.  A friend of mine got married a half hour away from where she had the reception...by the time we got there they were finished getting pics taken at the church and so really we only waited maybe another 1/2 for them to arrive. wasn't too bad. It's your day....you have your wedding where you want it....if people you invite don't show to the reception b/c they have to drive a little then piss on them.
jIsAIwCgaa	you should really tell your parents that someone physically harmed you. she could have broken your back! have your parents call the police. or next time your at practice make sure there is a cell handy and when she swows up be ready to call the police yourself and report harrassment.|`|vyGyLV7paa	make her miserable somehow.  next time she tries hurting you, punch her in the face.|`|DCFpYvxEaa	You should probably tell someone, but then you would look weak, so that may not be a good idea. I suggest that you bring a parent or coach with you to the park during your practices. Not to make it obvious, but say something such as 'I want you to see these new moves and tell us how you like them' so it's more of a show-off to them then rather let them know what's going on. Good Luck!|`|L316zgoSaa	dont be afraid to tell mom or dad, they r great at advice, plus as much as mom and dad love you they may come themselves. they prob- dont know this is happening to you. watch them get involved the moment you tell them. i would with my child. if anyone laid a finger, you better believe im involved. no one touches my child. your the most precious thing to them. and im sure they feel the same way.|`|8naQvPPtaa	Until you tell someone like a parent or supervisor it will keep happening and she is only showing off to her friends trying to get authority over you, she could have been bullied when younger and doesn't want it to happen again so does it to you to show she can't be touched sort of speak. Don't get in a fight though when she says something nasty don't get into an argument cause it will never end she just wants a reaction walk away as soon as they come near my younger sister had the same problem and i gave her the same advice, it took a little while for them to get bored but keep at it and if it gets worse were you start feeling unhappy because of it or if she physically hurts you tell someone immediatly.|`|30BcAMXYaa	Gather a bunch of girls and boys :D would be fun-er and give her a beat down show her what happens when she or was it he lol messes with older people.|`|t1WueC9aaa	Ok so either find a new place to practice im sure that could work, or bring a coach, parent something out to see you practice or supervise then she wont. You could always go to the principal, or get someone bigger then her to back you guys up... or how about get a guy to come watch, Id watch some girls cheer lead for an hour haha. Biggest concern is having someone around who could either tell her to back off or she will respect as authority. So get a boyfriend, bigger sized boy or someone to come watch :D

Once he married you he took on the responsibility of taking care of you and supporting you. Your parents are no longer liable for your bills or debts he is.  As for his parents...they need to butt out and stop putting their nose in you and your husbands business.|`|AA11803994	You and your husband's finances are yours and no one else's. What you do with your money as husband and wife is not the business of anyone else, especially parents. Parents will always try to put their two-cents in, and you can respect their opinion and listen to what they are saying, but in the end you and your husband are ultimately the ones who make the decisions.|`|djUMvICoaa	Once you're married you are on you own.  The buck stops there.  So how did his parents get involved into this anyway?  It's none of their business what you two do or what you pay for.|`|CugCzH9iaa	It would be nice if they helped but it is not their job!!!  It is now your husbands job to provide for you.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	If there is true love that a parent has for there child, they will help them no matter what they need help with money  food etc… if they have it, to give. For the lord say never say that you can not give. We can give in many ways to help some one in need. For some reason it seams like your parents do not want you to leave, or they would gladly give you the money think about it . Or is it that they are not well pleased with your husband for not allowing your parents to help pay for the wedding and rushed into it. there is something wrong here, look into it . I believe that your parents do not like your husband. Its like well you never wanted our help for the wedding, so we are not going to help you now .One of these answers is right, which one is it .|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	It is up to you and your husband now to pay that but try going to a different attorney, if that who is handling this, because although I really know nothing about this, you are now American because of the marriage and it seems a lot of money.  Good Luck!!|`|zOUEE48haa	ok i think once you get married all the problems you have are between you and your husband and iam sorry but inlaws should not be in this i had this same similar problem<br>  <br>  if you want to chat this is my email gre_ac@hotmail.com
AA10766729	Tell him that you're NOT going to quit your job....you like being a modern woman!  And tell him that he should stop being so paranoid....all it's doing is wrecking a perfectly good marriage!!<br>  <br>  Remind him too that the guilty scream the loudest.  In other words, if HE wasn't considering cheating, he certainly wouldn't accuse YOU of possibly doing so!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Make sure both of you are being trustworthy.  You might want to let him know that with all of the kids gone, and no one in the home to watch you, it would actually be easier for you to have an affair while at home.  That will get him thinking.|`|slHUNl58aa	I bet he is feeling less of a man from the pay cut so he is projecting his fears on you.<br>  Hopefully he starts feeling better about himself soon. <br>  I think you can help by making sure not to forget to compliment him on the little things we take for granted sometimes after a few years of marriage.<br>   Most important, make sure he knows you want him sexually.<br>  That may sound simple, but that seems to be what makes them feel most secure.<br>  Be the initiator.<br>  If all else fails, seek some counseling togeather, or just for yourself if he refuses.<br>  Good luck to you both.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Sounds to me like an ego thing more than anything.He used to be able to provide for you enough for you to stay home, and now he can't do that. Plus, he knows how close men and women work in the workforce. Maybe he thinks, in his low point, that someone "better" will come along. <br>  <br>  Just tell him that he's being unreasonable. If you have never cheated on him before or given him any reason to think that, he should see that.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	think it has allot to do with the loss of some of his salary, and him not feeling as if he can provide for his family. its within his ego. he thinks his loss will cause u to find someone who can provide better. men often define themselves through their jobs, and how successful they are.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	This is less about your job, and more about his pay cut.<br>  <br>  Look, his manhood has just taken a pretty substantial blow. His ability to provide for you and the kids what what he based his whole value on.<br>  <br>  Now that value is called into question.<br>  <br>  So the way you solve this is to keep up the intimacy, lots of compliments and hugs, and a lot of emotional support for him.<br>  <br>  If he came through the front door with a big gash in his chest, you'd lay him down and tend to the wound.<br>  <br>  Well, that's what has happened on the inside. He's cut clean through.<br>  <br>  So, be patient, be loving, be attentive, and this wound will heal.<br>  <br>  It'll heal a lot faster if he can find another job that pays him more. Achievements at work are going to count BIG now. So anytime he finishes a project or gets an accolade at work, just get excited for him and celebrate with some extra kisses. <br>  <br>  Don't worry...he'll heal up!|`|hs793CCxaa	He is de-stabilized at the moment - both with his pay cut and  a different home setting. Work through it together. Help him to work through it.<br>  <br>  It's not a "him or me" thing, it's about "us" and "our relationship". Make him KNOW that you only have eyes for him. Kiss, cuddle, fondle, pat, stroke him - just be tender and loving and he will not have any doubt. Help things get back to normal. That is what a good relationship is all about - one helping the other when they are a bit down or not functioning as normal. <br>  <br>  There is an e-book at <a href="http://www.bringbackthespark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringbackthespark.com</a> that may help you with a whole lot of suggestions on ways to get him so there is no way he will doubt your feelings for him. Good luck.|`|RCpkdx4haa	You have to make yourself happy. Being a prisoner in your house doesn't seem to be satisfying you. Hold your ground, any good man would tell you to do what makes you happy. I can't promise that you will get through this, but his immature nature and controllingness(is that a word?) is a terrible lesson for him to be teaching the kids. Children are MUCH more perseptive than we tend to give them credit for.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Sit him down for a heart to heart talk. Let him know how much you love him and how there is nothing that could make you want someone else.<br>  He just got used to having you at home all the time...and now your independence is probably scaring him. <br>  Re assure him, let him call you ten thousand times a day.Pretty soon he'll start calming down.|`|GOYk4SYqaa	yes hes not use to it but why do you have to reasure him of anything he should know that you love him and want to be with only him, i dont get that men cant reasure us women that they love us because of their pride but we have to do that for them when there insecure F that you tell him your not cheating and you ned your independence also that what keeps us sane when we have children|`|chlvKoXqaa	'wifey'   hmm~ it's your condescending atttitude,|`|B2cvkTp7aa	Why would he think you will cheat b/c you have a job? Did he cheat when he had one? If not, why would he not trust you? Many times people who are insecure like this are b/c they have done the same thing. <br>  <br>  If that is not the case, he may just be insecure b/c now he is not the breadwinner who takes care of you. May be a lot of ego involved. <br>  <br>  You really need to talk openly with him about this, and explain to him how happy you are with somehting to do, and to feel that you are also contributing. You got married for better and worse, richer and poorer! Life is not always perfect, but you are both going to have to understand that you have a good marriage even if he makes a bit less. Sounds like you understand this, but he feels bad about it. <br>  <br>  I can understand the weird thing, but I think weird means he feels like he can't support you in the way you deserve to be supported. He just may need a wake up call that you love him anyway. <br>  <br>  If you try everything and nothing works, or he starts accusing you of cheating, than that can lead to trouble. <br>  <br>  I hope you work this out. You sound like a loving wife.|`|TI65WNunaa	This is a tough one but it does not sound like you are giving him reasons to treat you like this.  Things change, situations change, people change even in marriage.  He is letting this new situation get the better of his imagination.  Your husband should be glad that you have the education and ability to go to work now that things have changed financially in your home.  Now is the time to pull together instead of apart.  He needs to count his blessings that he has a smart healthy wife who loves him.  As far as advice I would just remind him that the bills have to get paid.|`|Zvhf3yGNaa	Explain to him you have no reason to ever cheat on him. You chose him, and only him, and are working to support each other. It shouldn't even be an issue for you to be working. If he keeps jabbing at you about it, you need to tell him to back off, because if he doesn't you two are going to get into trouble financially and emotionally. You are still a human who has a choice, and your choice is to help support your family. Ask him how you can prove that he can trust you, without his excuse to stay home.
AA10766729	Certainly, to some that would be true.  But that's the magic of marriage AND divorce.<br>  <br>  The problem with bigamy however is that the more wives you have the more mothers-in-law you also have!|`|CHeHYwVNaa	False. Monogamy means only having one spouse, usually for life. Maybe Oscar Wilde hated his wife (if he had one), or just women in general, so he was stating that even one wife was too much to handle.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Hey if you want to marry a guy, that's cool. It's your life, do what you want.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Oscar Wilde was homosexual, and if you're homosexual, well, so be it!  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Do as you please!  :)|`|1HfLkTrdaa	That Oscar Wilde. What a character.<br>  <br>  He was married, but he was also gay, you know...so that might explain his attitude.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	false. total opposites|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I think both area  state of mind. If you wish to live your life with more than one woman and they feel the same way then go for it. If you do not believe in Monogamy and wish to live in an open relationship or no relationship at all then that is up to you as well. <br>  <br>  Live your life to make yourself happy. Try not to hurt anyone in the process though.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	...ahhhhh, the world according to Oscar Wilde. <br>  He was just presenting a very cynical opinion on marriage...er...uh...or perhaps women.<br>  (Bet he didn't get any quite often. lol)|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	what a man! <br>  <br>  I'm partial to woody Allen quotes myself. <br>  <br>  "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work...

p9QglBpyaa	It completely depends on the couple. Some people are very immature and very unprepared to be married in their early twenties. Some are not. Only you two can know what's the right decision for you. Re-consider the question without using your age, but the more important factors. Are you mature enough to handle the responsibilities of being married? Are you 100% sure he is the one for you? Are you completely willing to do what it takes to stay together and make it work? Is it something you want or something you feel obligated to do? These questions are far more important than what age is the appropriate age to marry. <br>  <br>  I just got married in October and I was 21. It was the right decision for us.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think you are too young.  You are going to be changing a lot in the next few years.  Both of you are.  You should wait till you find out if you still like each other and want to be together after the changes.|`|CM0C65dtaa	I married very young at 17, and it isn't always a mistake, but why hurry?  If it is true love it can stand to wait a little while.  I would give it a couple years, just because people grow up a lot in that age period, and it is more likely to last if you are both that much older.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	If you are worried about what other people think instead of just what you and your boyfriend feel, then yes, YOU are too young to get married.  I think you actually feel you are too young to get married but are using "what other people think" as an excuse.  <br>  <br>  When you don't care what other people and aren't concerned about that, then you may be old enough to get married.  or at least confident in your relationship enough to get married.|`|eeGN977eaa	I got married when I was 18, I am now 27 and still married.<br>  My brother got married at 18 and divorced 3 years later.<br>  My sister got married at 17 and divorced 2 years later.<br>  <br>  My point is that age isn't an indicator of the right time.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	don't live your life worry what other people think, if you love each other then go for it but i will say i wouldn't want my daughter to get married at that age, but that's my opinion.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	I dont think is too young to get marry,but wait a lil to have kids...21 to start is a good age...In my opinion...|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well I don't think it's too young if you are both ready for that commitment and plan to live your life together forever.  Nowadays marriage isn't taken serious it's too easy to just get divorced. People may may comments to you cuz that is young and you haven't really lived life.  Maybe you and your bf can be engaged for another year to see if you all still believe you should marry after that time.  Just don't rush into something just to do it marriage is a special thing and should be thought out not just jumped into to find out later it wasn't the right thing to do.|`|2KC467tFaa	I married when I was 21. If you're ready, no one can tell you otherwise. Age does not determine maturity. We also married after knowing each other for 3 months. People look down on us, but this is the strongest, healthiest, happiest relationship I've ever been in. I understand they're trying to protect us, but I trust my decisions. I knew he was the perfect one for me. I was right. You have the answers. No one knows you better than you know yourself. I wish you both a happy life together.|`|n8Db77zbaa	it doesnt matter what everyone thinks, all that matters are your thoughts on it, and if you are both ready for all challenges that are ahead whether they be good or bad. Trust me, I got married at that age too, and Im turning 24 this year. WE've definitely hit pock botton at one point, but we hit it together, and we're stronger than ever now.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I got married at 21 - this summer solstice it'll be 13 years!  If you two are mature enough, dedicated enough (and I MEAN that!), and responsible enough - you can make it...<br>  <br>  Just understand that you will both do a lot of growing over the next few years and it puts a strain on the relationship.  You must be prepared to follow through on your vows and work through things.  If you find there is a time you just can't communicate - go get marital counseling.  It can help!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!<br>  <br>  Add:  I agree with others - stay on the birth control and wait on kids for a few years...I had my baby at 25 and that was long enough for us to get few years of ups and downs in first...|`|djUMvICoaa	It depends on how long you've been together that I would base my decision on.  21 is not too young for most people and as long as both parties are sure they know what they are getting into and for what reason.|`|UwNKFSBeaa	way too young. don't do it.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	No it isn't too young.|`|hXNuyTKaaa	No. I got married when i was freshly 18.

77LXA7mqaa	it really depends on how long you've been together or known each other. Sometimes, its just a phase were in your trust and understanding is being tested by time.<br>  <br>  but, if it starts to hurt or affect other people, including yourself, or its draining too much energy on both of you, then talk about it first on what's best for the both of you. in any problem, as long as both of you know how to compromise, then all will end well..|`|bEaJHY1uaa	i used to argue with my ex allll the time! we fought every time we saw each other. we were together for a year, and as surprising as it sounds our arguments seem to keep the relationship interesting.  he wasn't a good guy, very abusive physically and emotionally so I had to end it.|`|RRxlVNHQaa	well if u r a arguementive person && they r too then just stick with it.<br>  i am && talked 2 this guy that did 2 && it didnt work out 2 well.<br>  but i know what u mean by ALWAYS.<br>  we had fun arugeing though && i kno it|`|vzTGbBCfaa	Get out it will never change, love doesn't have to hurt.
65ojSBXgaa	Well emotional abuse is when someone tells you hurtful things that make you cry, makes you feel depressed. And mental abuse is when someone tells you; you are not good enough at anything. Both abuses are the same they hurt and they damage you. A person who is an emotional abuser and mental are wicked , evil and dont have a soul. They obviously had a bad life to be that way....<br>  Gail|`|BhYuttozaa	So someone saying your so F-ing stupid, stupid c u n t , you so retarted, you have a pee sized brain, are you that ******* dumb?  stuff like that then that would be considered emotional abuse?

Where is your wedding reception? If it is in a hall, you could decorate one end and have the ceremony there as well. I am attending a wedding in Edmonton in April and it is in a Senior's complex. The ceremony will be outside in their little flower garden - if it rains it will move inside to the small chapel they have. Reception in the large "events room" at same place.I have also attended joint wedding ceremonies/receptions in Edmonton at Legion halls. You have to use their caterers but they are very cooperative. You could also look a bit further out. Sherwood Park has some nice hotels with large foyers that would be pretty for a ceremony. I would also suggest asking your officiant! They go all over the place to perform weddings and might just have a long list of locations that you haven't known about.

62577f8890a63367299c541234ce9886aa	I definitely do not think you are overreacting. Your family DISOWNED you, and completely disregarded your side of the arguement. They should be a lot more sensitive to what they did to you and your son. Yes, the family being mad at them is awful, but the fact that they didn't trust you is awful too.<br>  <br>  I personally think it's completely understandable if you are mad at them. But, for your son's sake you will have to eventually let go. If you want your parents to be a part of your son's life, it's a sacrifice you'll have to make -- let go of your anger for the sake of his happiness.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me they were the ones who overreacted, and I know that makes it all the more difficult to get past this, but they are your family. If you can't "forget" it could mean that you are being almost as bad as they were.<br>  <br>  It'll take time, but you definitely have a right to be angry. Just don't let your anger blind your judgement. Hope this helps!|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Yep, you're all over-reacting.

If they want to see your child then tell them you have to sit down and have a chat about things going on and if that meeting goes well then they could see your child.|`|2102b6ebb00d225ec8e70793af7fce4baa	I have to say your a little overreacting. People do things they regret. They want to stay so dont make the situation more tense than it is by not talking to them.If there trying you should try.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	no, they were extremely rude.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	If you can find the means, you need to bury the hatchet.  If at all possible, you need to have an adult conversation with them.  Personally (if this were my situation) I would be wanting to know what it is that made them so willing to do what they did in the first place -- perhaps they already harbored some bad feelings for other things?  Best to get everyone talking ON A REGULAR BASIS in order to not have such enourmous missunderstandings in the future... if nothing else, for the sake of your child.
iMoTw1wIaa	The short answer to this, is he has feelings for you. He might not be willing to admit it, but he has at some point developed real interest in you, or he has a crush on you. The way he is acting is out of jealousy. He does not want to keep hearing about the troubles with your husband or things of that nature, because he wants you. I've seen it happen many times... and a lot of the time if you just stick with it, give him some space, try to go out and do things with him that involve your husband, try to get the two of them to be friends, it will most likely pass. People develop crushes all the time that quickly pass. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't have a girlfriend himself, try to help him to find someone. If he does have a girlfriend, try to involve her in things that you do with him. Don't waste time trying to confront him on his feelings, just try to push forward with your friendship and give him some space.|`|zfuDMgafaa	He was saying that in you giving him a hard time about ignoring messages from you, you were nagging and being like a wife, which you have no right to do if he's just a friend. I think he was being a bit hard on you to say that though! The last comment about i am lost completely i will talk to you tomorrow probably means he was losing track of the conversation, it got all confused and he would take it up again tomorrow after he could think about it more clearly.|`|1LgXCEgtaa	I think someone has feelings for you. My best friend used to do that to me. Ignore me randomly and then get overly defensive when I'd tell him he was ignoring me and ask "Shouldn't you be spending more time with 'boyfriend at the time'?". Now we're dating. Or he could just be having a hard time right now but doesn't want to talk about it.|`|KeDY8hNvaa	he means that he isn't your husband so he shouldn't have to talk to you<br>  <br>  maybe something's up with him|`|KF5pitm8aa	He might be irritated if you are trying to keep tabs on him (like where he was, who he was with, etc.), and then gave him a "hard time" about it later. <br>  It is probably just your "mother hen" instinct coming out, but guys hate it. Just apologize.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like he is a bit jealous of your husband.|`|AA11193401	he is falling for you
7JDuae2Laa	I'm sorry to tell you this...but I don't think he loves you seriously..I mean, he left you for another girl! She probably just didn't give in and he came back to you.|`|hLBEXVyXaa	i would get an answer out of him. it sounds like he could be telling the truth, but you're right, if he means that he loves you, he should be able to tell you why. the next time he tries to get you back and he tells you he loves you, ask him "why? why do you love me, what do you love about me?" if he says the same thing  tell him that he's gotta have a reason. he can't say something so powerful and meaningful, with no power and no meaning. then tell him what you said you wanted to tell him. then tell him that thats why you love him, so why does he love you?<br>  hope it all goes well [:<br>  <br>  could you help me with my crisis please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226145320AAYJlvq&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|htpxHZTPaa	I think you've answered your own question.

If he says uhh,um,idk,do i have to, or y that means he doesnt.|`|2GbsR7XSaa	if you really truly love him you shouldnt doubt him or yourself and if its LOVE nothing is too mushy or personal.. he sound slike bullshit to me. you don't deserve to be left like that. DONT GIVE IN! think about yourself before you think about him|`|ih1JD5xYaa	If you want to take him back then do so if you really want to, but make it perfectly clear that he has to earn the trust back|`|JzK59nt1aa	He could actually mean what he says. Leaving you like that was a jerk thing to do but for him it could be one of those scenarios where "you dont know what youve got till its gone" or "distance makes the heart grow fonder". Once he though he lost you he realized how much he actually does love you and need you in his life.<br>  thats just one theory, he could just care about you a lot and feels bad for what he did and says he loves you to try and make you feel better and secure with him because he does care about you a lot|`|WvcTLuGNaa	Trust ain't easy. specially when some one ruins it. I was in a similar boat about two years ago. She cheated on me, she kissed a guy. She came to me and apologized and i believed her. but obviously the trust had been broken. <br>  <br>  Trust has to be earned and he has to know that. he has to know that your willing to forgive but make him understand that he has hurt your trust.<br>  <br>  About the being in love with you thing, If he is a mans a man then he isn't going to tell you he loves your smile and your his everything. But there are ways to tell, If you catch him staring at you, If he smiles when you walk in the door, Does go to hold your hand, does he hug you tight. These can all be signs that he is head over heals.<br>  <br>  most guys can't describe what they feel. It's just hard to get the words out so we say things like "i dunno" so that we can still give an answer.<br>  <br>  By the way, eventually i trustgirlfriendfriend again, and we had the best time. After being with her i can say i Know what being in love really feels like.
UBdt4Wm0aa	Go to counseling...not because you necessarily have an issue, but to learn to cope with him.....then eventually go to counseling together. You can work through this! I've experienced it and lived through it. Oh, and in the meantime, when he makes you angry because of his emotional distance and not giving you what you need and deserve, leave the room and find a way to relax until you can discuss things calmy. I get on Yahoo answers, then go on pogo.com and play games when I'm mad at him. Gets me past that inferiated moment so I can calm down and talk to him without wanting to totally tell him off. LOL|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Sounds like your expectations are too high and you've both gotten into a cycle of trying and not satisfying and shutting down.<br>  <br>  " I have tried everything to make things work but somehow he just lets me down and I react." <br>  <br>  "I am a very emotional person and when I get hurt, I tend to react and abuse him verbally. All this further spoils our relationship."<br>  <br>  Sounds like he's given up trying to please you, was he ever able?|`|y9CgveCGaa	Tell you husband what you want from him.  Tell him what being emotionally distant means.  I've been through this with my wife.  I didn't know what she was talking about.  She would say don't be emotionally distant.  I thought she meant she wanted to talk about how she felt.  What she meant was help me with the laundry, take out the trash and do the dishes.  And play with the kids more.  I didn't associate that stuff with emotional support.  Now I know better.|`|7Wi32KRgaa	Put on something sexy and be his girlfriend, cover him with sexual favors and make him a nice dinner. If he still doesn't respond after a week of that he is emotionally detached. Most times the wife has all the control you just need to get it back with a little lovin'|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Have you told him this?  Have you tried to explain to him that you feel  most loved when he's doing things for you (acts of service)<br>  <br>  My only advice is counseling.  And reading the book "the five love languages"<br>  <br>  I luv my kids, why wouldn't you try counseling?  Refusal to try to fix the problem is contributing to the problem.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	You are describing my life. My husband wants us to go to counseling and I don't want to go.  He acts the same way you say your husband acts. He is never there for me.  I don't know what I will do.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Well whatever chance you had at getting to the core of his emotional distance, it sounds like you've really shut it down now with your handling your upset.  Sorry to hear...more damage done, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  If you love him, continue to "care" for him.  If he doesn't help with house/child, go your own way and do it - and also, make time for yourself.  I'd leave my son or daughter with friend for a weekend and leave him for a weekend and leave a letter expressing my feelings and telling him he has the weekend to think about it, were I you...See if you get ANY reaction from this guy.  If not, you need to go to counseling, alone if he won't...It's not clear what the core of this is - something you've done/said?  He's not longer interested and staying together for the sake of the child?  It's not clear how he feels, is it?<br>  So be proactive and take some action...just curtail that temper of yours girl, or you're going to ruin any possibility of communication further and I'm not certain at this juncture, whether damage has ALREADY been done and you're not seeing it for what it is...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Talk to him and tell him how he makes you feel find out what it will take to get him to be more emotional with you and helpful with family matters.  He has a family and should be involved. Talking things out would definitely clear the air if he is willing to sit down and talk to you.  That's a hard way to live and not exactly what I would call a marriage.|`|T9MWQDqpaa	When you find the answer let me know.  going through the same thing.<br>  been married 8 years, and we never talk, touch, or anything. he refuses to go to work (hasn't worked in 6 years) and does nothing to help around the house.  We have 3 kids, I don't want to leave either, but am seriously considering it lately. I work and pay the bills, and I am so tired of dealing with all this.  sometimes enough is enough!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	There is a reason he is distant. That is what you have to figure out. Is it that he doesn't want to help? He doesn't know how to help? He doesn't know how to be there for you? Have you given him examples of what would make you happy?<br>  Men and women think differently. Woman assume men know what we want, how to act, but sometimes men don't get it. Sometimes you need to draw them a picture for things YOU would think are just common sense.<br>  In the meantime you are being hurt. You are thinking he just doesn't care. But is that really it? <br>  Seek a marriage counselor. Tell him you really need to understand him better, and he needs to understand you. Why he does what he does, and so on. <br>  Props to you for not giving up on your marriage, and trying to work it out. If you both try to understand each other and the way each of you thinks it'll be easier to get through things like this.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|AA11803994	Some men (most men) just aren't that great at relationships or being sensitive to a woman's needs. <br>  This is where you (us women) come in. Women are usually great at relationships. We're sensitive...we're thoughtful...we have girl talks to help our friends with problems ;)<br>  <br>  It is totally understandable for you to be frustrated. You have every right to be. You want this man to help you out, make you feel appreciated...love on YOU for a change, right?<br>  <br>  Realize that no matter how good someone is, they will always disappoint you in one way or another. Nobody's perfect. With that said, that doesn't mean that we don't aspire to be perfect or to try to not disappoint people. <br>  <br>  The first thing I suggest you do is start being positive (even if you don't feel like it). Don't shout at him or belittle him. Love on him....treat him with respect. This is your husband and you mentioned above that he's a nice guy so cut him a little slack - he's a GUY! ;)<br>  <br>  Talk to him...be supportive and loving and let him know how you feel and how it makes you feel when he doesn't help you with things. Explain to him that you are not just a wife but a mother, too, and a cook and a launderess and a cleaner and a homework helper and every other thing we family women do. <br>  <br>  I really encourage you to get into a marriage class. A lot of churches have them. They are wonderful. The one my husband and I did was called Marriage 101 and it was taught by an older husband and wife. It focused on deepening our relationship with each other and with God and gave great tips on how guys can be better fathers and husbands and how women can be better wives and mothers. It was an awesome experience to see ourselves changing for the better!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!|`|Deb4iqbvaa	You are a woman, and we are emotional and need to feel connected. So if he's ingoring you of course you are angry. <br>  <br>  My husband was addicted to video games. Besides eating & sleeping, he wouldn't do a thing around the house, especially pay attention to me. I tried many times to speak with him, I often got the response of an angry 15 year old kid instead of a 30 year old man.<br>  <br>  I actually got advice from a reformed "gamer," who told me to tell my husband that I was leaving him for another man. (Even though there was no one else). When my husband realized he had blown the whole thing, he wised up. So if yours thinks his life is about to go up in smoke, he will change.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I'd like to add this: I also stopping doing his laundry, cooking for him, and buying foods that he likes. Once he had to do those things for himself he realized how much it is on top of a full-time job and he was more appreciative.|`|NjzUGZSuaa	I JUST finished with a relationship (boyfriend) that was exactly like your husband. I would get very upset and then say things that would make the situation worse with anger. You CAN NOT bottle up your feelings just to spare his, that is exactly what I did. That made me an emotional wreck. Your feelings are very important and you need to believe that and at least acknowledge that to yourself because he will not do it. I did begin to understand though that anger did not solve anything and only made me feel worse.|`|uUfyOLceaa	It is such a long road between having a job and children and having each other again. Look high on a shelf in your heart - you'll find you've put away what turned you on about your guy so you could do day to day stuff. He's done the same thing. That spark and fire didn't disappear. You both volunteered to set it aside to keep your home going. So you both wait not very patiently for the other one to take it down. You both pout and hurt each other's feelings because you can't have it. He's so packed with held-back emotions that only random ones pop out. Sometimes they hurt other people because they hurt him. It's not just you that catches hell. He's full of rage at not being able to be with you in the crazy, fun way he used to. So are you. He feels like he's the saint for not complaining about all his negative feelings. You're both emotionally detached so you won't feel how much you want to just go out and have each other. Remember the last really good day you had together, when you laughed so hard your stomach hurt? Yes, it was that long ago. Having those good days isn't optional. It's as important as air and food for a marriage. Marriage is commitment like yours, through times so hard and cold only the strong survive. It's cold for him too. Find some time together to warm it up. Then tell each other your vows again. Good luck.
AA10065812	???<br>  That fully depends in the included factors.<br>  <br>  Were the parents married?  Single fathers have no assumed rights to a child.<br>  <br>  Were there any allegations of abuse?  In 60% of child custody cases the mother will accuse the father of sexually abusing the children.<br>  <br>  Were there any allegations of domestic violence?  Under the VAW Act, a father who battered the mother of his children, or defended himself when attacked by the violent mother of his children, cannot have custody.  Even grabbing her arms to prevent her from scratching him is grounds for denial of custody.<br>  <br>  Is there a Guardian Ad Litem?  This is a person who represents and speaks for the child in court.<br>  <br>  What type of custody is under consideration?  Sole, Joint Legal, Joint Physical, or Bird Nest?<br>  <br>  What if the father turns out not to be the father of the children? In a Pennsylvania case, the three children were not his, but he still won custody.  In a Michigan, he was denied custody of the 15 year old, at which point the mother was awarded 15 years of retroactive child support against the bio-dad, who was 11 when she had sex with him and got pregnant.  She was 25 at the time.  <br>  <br>  Currently, fathers get primary custody in 15% of the cases, but only get child support 1% of the time.  Most fathers think they can't win custody, when in reality, they unknowingly hire attorneys who are unwilling to fight for it.<br>  <br>  Personally, I promote Bird Nest Custody.<br>  <br>  It should be noted that the original author of the first joint custody laws died this week.<br>  <br>  Father Makes Two<br>  Time Magazine<br>  By Margot Roosevelt - Sunday, Nov. 11, 2003<br>  <br>  Quote:<br>  "As late as 1971, the Minnesota State Bar Association's handbook advised lawyers and judges that "except in very rare cases, the father should not have custody of the minor children. He is usually unqualified psychologically and emotionally." When James Cook, a Los Angeles real estate lobbyist, divorced in 1974 and sought shared custody of his son, "the judge thought it was preposterous," he recalls. "He told me, 'I don't have permission to do it.'" Outraged, Cook and some friends organized the Joint Custody Association and in 1979 pushed through the California legislature the first law encouraging joint custody. All 50 states eventually followed suit....."|`|Wkosntqgaa	i think its sort of like a meeting just inside of a court room. there's a plaintiff and a defendant. the parents state their problems and why they think they should have custody over the child. then they ask the child a few questions about her parents but her parents can't be in the room while she's being interviewed. then they ask the child who would she rather live with and why. then she has to state the reasons she doesn't want to live with the other parent. since there's always three sides to a story (the plaintiff's side) (the defendant's side) and the truth, in this case there's four sides because the child can always lie just to get their way and live with the fun parent. the judge analyzes the info she heard and she tells the parents example: "Its a shared custody, Mrs. Scott you will have full custody over the child on the weekdays, Mr. Scott you must have custody over the child on weekends no excuse and you are also going to pay child support to pay for your daughter's expenses. Mr and Mrs. Scott, I suggest you get those divorce papers signed, meeting adjourned."
XLntctpaaa	Hi there, you answered my relationship drama Q so thought id give you some input on yours too :) I was kinda in the same situation you are in with my current partner. I ruined our relationship by being a B***H and treating him badly and he fell out of love with me and left me and i tried EVERYTHING in my power to win him back coz once he left and said he didnt love me things clicked and i realized how horrible i was to him. But yea all my effort did nothing, i started to accept it was over and then he came back, so dont try and convince him to come back he has to want to come back to you and if not, then its his loss in the end right!!! You could give him a few days space then maybe let him know that you will change and not be so demanding, arhh i wish i could tell myself that hahha, but yea uni should help, ive been on Uni hols and had waaaay too much time to think and analyze everything, im looking forward to being busy and you should too !!|`|sb4dcv1oaa	GET Of TOwN.

9iEzXDqWaa	Dear Wondering, First of all what would suicide do to help? Do you believe in God? If so, then just ask God into your life,ask for his favor in helping you with each and every problem that you have been having. You must have faith for him too get through however. Your an intelligent person are else you would not have a Master's Degree. Your one of the lucky ones I have never been able to go too college. Finally after all of these years I'm finally going too get my chance,and I'm taking and running with it. Al way's count your blessing each and everyday. God put you on this earth for a reason,Use your mind and gather yourself. Then when you feel your ready to start,get on with your life,don't let small problems become big ones. Just take life one day at a time. Start by setting yourself some small goals,and reaching them.Then move on too bigger and better things later on. Do you have a pet to keep you copy on lonely night's? If not you might want too think about getting one. There great for cuddling,and they don't judge. You said you use to be a great Mom,you still can be. You can be a great worker again too,just ask God's help at the beginning of each day,and remember too thank him at the end of each day. Soon your life will start getting better,it just taker's time. Good Luck And God Bless You,I Really Hope Everything Works Out For You......................|`|d0MIgl38aa	first, do whatever it takes to be on top of your game at work. When people get into trouble at work it is because they have grown to comfortable (act as if you are always being watched you will work better Leave the squabbles to the children) second just look forward, and walk forward. don't try to live up to or try to equal the past.|`|nsGPMenjaa	You need to tackle one thing at a time. <br>  <br>  For example, first put all of your effort into getting back on track at work. Get there early, really concentrate on your work, not your other problems. Don't call in sick or take many days off. Leave all your other problems at home - you can deal with them later. Show your boss that you are really committed to doing a good job.<br>  <br>  Next, when you feel like you have a handle on that, pick something else - IE - your bank account. Just be extra careful with your spending. Take a small amount of cash out of your account at the beginning of each week so that you don't have to use your debit card for every little thing. (When I used to use my debit card for tons of little things every week, like a bagel here, a coke there, it became harder to keep track of. And then one little slip - like charging 50 cents over what I had in my checking account, and it was just a downward spiral from there!) <br>  <br>  Then, to repair damaged relationships, once you have your job and money under control, start suggesting meeting a friend/family member, one at a time, for dinner or a movie once a week. Then, you will be creating new memories with them that will replace the old ones that maybe aren't so great. Explain to them that you are sorry your friendship has suffered, but you would really like to build it back up again.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helped. I have felt like you do before. It does all seem like soooo much, but if you take baby steps, one at a time, each step isn't so big. and before you know it, you'll feel like a huge weight has lifted off of your shoulders.

Well if it was me i would talk to her about it and tell her that you said it was ok and now you like him and try get her approval.<br>  If she doesn't come round you could always do it anyway she would come round eventually she's you're  best friend and  wouldn't let a guy get in the way of.|`|AA11452335	Can you see yourself "breaking up" with your friend because the likelyhood of Hunter breaking up with you after you either "give it up" or don't give it up are high.  You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Stay friends with Olivia...  and stuff.|`|jIsAIwCgaa	call her and say "thanks for hooking us up" and see how she reacts and if its bad then tell her you will call it off cuz your friendship is more important...|`|sbeoF50gaa	This is like a "How to" On sharing STDs.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	wow take it to jerry springer lol|`|L316zgoSaa	she gave you the go-ahead, you can even tell her, im so glad you recommended hunter to me, it seems to be working out together. gee i wouldnt have gotten with him, if you didnt push me as much as you did! so thanks. <br>  this way she remembers she did push u towards him. besides no man is taken until he is a boyfriend/fiance/husband to someone. and she is not a friend if she gets mad, if anything she pulled a trickery on you if she got upset. She really shouldnt get upset, so just tell her.|`|4AL6Nj36aa	I don't think you will lose Olivia as a friend. I am assuming your pretty young by the structure of your question and I can tell you that Hunter is not a long term relationship (most likely). But friendships, and I mean real friendships last a lifetime. Don't worry about the small things. If you were 25, I'd caution you to choose from an ultimatum: Either keep the boyfriend or keep your friend! But right now at your age. Just let it go. It'll work itself out! Good luck! Katrina:)|`|DNU5S8keaa	What kind of friend would push you to do it and then tell you that it hurt her ? Thats dumb, If the 2 of you really hit it off than what buisness is it of hers. I'm not trying to be mean but friends in school are a waste because you never see them after you graduate so whatever.|`|8naQvPPtaa	Your friend might say shes not bothered but she will when she sees you with him all the time. If it was me i would keep away from the situation altogether tread carefully thats all im saying it could end in tears.|`|My8M2NmRaa	since hunter doesn't like her she should find someone else to like. and she did say she was cool with it in the first place. or maybe you should just not date him anymore.|`|9L7zCS8faa	you shouldnt hook up with him! NEVER CHOOSE A BOY OVER YOUR FRIENDS!! BOYS ARE WHENEVER BUT FRIENDS ARE FOREVER!!
tXSPCtHCaa	No......I say you give her exactly what she's asking for. Space. Do not call, do not write, do not go over.  She will wonder why you're not bugging her and SHE will come to you, which is what you want.|`|vzTGbBCfaa	Yes on the way to being dumped.  Start looking for a new girl|`|bKxPEDiWaa	That will make you seem clingy. Just get over it. :D|`|iUkog1xQaa	Give her space. Have fun with your friends and hobbies to take your mind off things. Do not contact her. Do NOT send her gifts. Let her initiate the contact.<br>  <br>  You can't do anything to make her come closer to you. You can only do things to make her NOT want to come closer. So focus your energy on something else.|`|LMgwiS1daa	Two weeks ago I came back from a HORRIBLE San Diego trip.  From Orange County to Cleveland Ohio we didn't speak or anything.  As far as I was concerned we weren't done, he had a different take on things.  We are engaged, and he even told me that we needed space.  I told him that was to bad and that he is stuck with me.  The reason our trip was so bad was because he insisted on bringing his 16 y.o. daughter (with no friend) and it was so trying on my nerves because we couldn't have a minute alone.  We were there for my best friends wedding, and she was constantly negative.  It got to the point where we got into a HUGE fight and ended up leaving 2 days early.  It wasn't a good experience, and it was my first time flying....no we are fine, and everything has worked out...my advice is that if you've only been together 2 months - let her have your space.  It's to soon in the relationship to really feel as though you are meant to be, don't take me wrong if you know, you know...just be sure.  It's easier to cut your losses before you really get involved.  If she is saying that she wants space, give it to her.  She may come crawling back after she realizes that the grass is greener on the other side.|`|a9BTKZ18aa	nahhh girls are just difficult like that i sometimes do that to see if my bf would freak out or just ignore it girls love it when a guy starts freaking out wondering if they are going to be dumped,if the girl is cheating or something like that|`|SZUzatcJaa	Ha! Don't you worry. Girls always do this. Just give her her space and once in a while send her flowers, chocolate to show that your still interest in her. Talk to her as well. In no times you will have her in bed with ya.|`|ebC4Uo02aa	well if she was with you all the time you would want your space too, everyone needs there space, just giver her, her space and soon she will miss you and want to be with you.|`|VMY7No0eaa	sounds like she wants a VACATION from YOU.<br>  it might cool down and straighten out later on.  Not unrepairable though.  <br>  Women are funny though... they take and take and take and then one day they are though... <br>  so feel the waters and proceed cautiously|`|xmdh8iY3aa	If a girl is already asking for space after 2 months its definitely not a good sign. I'd move on if I were you. If she's interested she'll come back. Let her make the next move.<br>  <br>  Lotsa other fish in the sea.|`|WdW1ga14aa	I would say to give her her space like she has asked for.  Sometimes us girls do not get over things as easily as you guys do.  I would not recommend you sending her flowers or chocolates.  Also if I were you I would not text her, call her, bug her, just give her space.  If it is meant to be then she will come back around and if not well then just move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Send her some flowers and give it a few days.  You probably just annoyed the hell out of each other.  If you need to apologize then do so.  Don't listen to all these people that you are dumped.  If you really like the girl and think that two of you have a chance together then you have to work on it.  Two months isn't long enough to know each other very well.|`|185855d94f08cdc1a05e5ff48efc7a27aa	hey who cares if u get dumped or not have fun with life and enjoy what u have if u had a bad time with her in vegas sooooo what go have fun...life is not always crappy but sometimes u have to have fun|`|Un9CElCaaa	if a girl ever tells u she needs space make it clear to her that it's space forever. it's over for u 2. if she tries to come back tell her to hit the road|`|pDptioSNaa	If you send the chocolate now....it will improve her mood.

She might come back.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	move on buddy there is plenty of tricks out there specialy in vegas go back n catch one|`|GJLjNk5Waa	It sounds to me like she dumped you.  You two are the only ones who know if it is repairable or not.  It depends on what started the fighting.  If you guys are constantly fighting, it may be a good idea to take some space.  If you truly don't know why she asked for space, then talk to her about it now.  There's no need to wait a week.  If things are repairable, you may as well find out now.  Good luck...|`|tLBjsrEFaa	yes its over, sorry charlie|`|FCmuA1KEaa	Don't give up just yet. Maybe she just wants some time to herself. I've been with my boyfriend for over a year and we're living together now.

r3O9XCSBaa	eventually it does, everyone is different. In the inside of a woman vagina there are muscles that tighten and loosen. sometimes they tighten up depending on stress and other natural responses and it will take a short while to loosen up a bit. And it also depends on the size of your partner that will make a difference too.|`|SSfXwkpnaa	if ur too tence it can hurt so have some foreplay first to get you in the mood. depending on what kind of pain it is you could have an STI. but most likely you wer too tence. just make sure you really want it and your relaxed.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Sometimes it depends on the size of the guy's penis, if he is small it wont hurt, o its obvious he got a big co-ck if it hurts.

AA10499288	That definitely means something. This my sound odd but researchers did a study on this. They found that there really is that "spark" for some people and it is significant. The ex probably has no idea what you are talking about because guys really just don't think like that, it's literally the way their brain is wired.|`|Ry4r4ycwaa	aww <br>  totally get that guy if there's a connection, then go with it<br>  some guys you don't feel any spark (they're the frogs) but when you get tingly thats the one you gotta catch & keep ^_^ (trust me, i know)|`|AA12359831	i remember my first kiss.<br>  i was so tingly inside.<br>  it was butterflies in my stomach.<br>  haha it was amazing.<br>  <br>  probably cause you like this guy. and you ex didnt mean as much to you. so the kiss was probably meaningless.|`|EEfd3WLhaa	Yes, it's just excitement over the possibility of a new guy...ENJOY!|`|CdUvu8D8aa	its cuz the dude was spontaneous so it was romantic|`|0jyUskYhaa	well some people call it the "spark" but yes it is vary normal|`|MHQkgpdqaa	you got like butterfllies. <br>  you just really like him .|`|ku8USJ49aa	yes if you feel something that means like you just click!|`|qS35btkHaa	yeah it means you really like him(:|`|AXZQoaxnaa	yesss thats big you<br>  probably like him alot<br>  did ur foot pop lol:)|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	hes the one u like!!:)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiKtOMVnekiSuuWDchcAXVPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226145748AASML1D">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|aXqi9lYJaa	yep it's called "when sparks fly"<br>  <br>  it means u are attracted more to this guy than ur ex|`|k07IyDvwaa	im so happy for you!<br>  thats what i want my first kiss to be like: romantic and i want to get all tingly inside(my first REAL kiss, anyway)<br>  i think that you felt something when he kissed you, dont let him get away, because you two will probably have something special|`|wI3AAkIoaa	When there is a connection you always feel something.

7gH7sgi6aa	Families are the hardest to work for, especially Dads.  If he was cheap the last time and ditched out with only .50 then you need to have your ducks in line when you go in and ask for a raise.<br>  Go in prepared and show him how you have improved, new skills you have learned, and new tasks you have taken on that you feel enable to receive a raise.  Be polite, but professional.  Don't play up to him as Daddy, but address him as a boss.<br>  Tell him your last raise was substandard and that you feel you deserve a $1.50 raise, to make up for the lose of the last .50 you didn't get.  He will probably meet you at $1.00.<br>  Remember, be professional, polite, and address him as a boss.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|2kV8WdYUaa	Listen, tell him or her that your going through somethings and you need more money.  Don't be scared, because if it was him needed one from his boss.  He probably would ask.  If that's something you need really bad.  You tell him.  Just say: Can we talk in private and then say. Im going through a difficult time right now and I need more money.  Tell him that you like your job, even if you don't and you would like to stay there, but you just need more money.  Say, Im in a financial bind and you need it.

Just start out small, talk to girls who are more friendly than others, work your way up, eventually you'll be talking to mof*ckin prom queen. Really, I live it, 3 years ago i was just like you. Find a girl you can relate with but dont really like, make sure she doesn't get the wrong idea, then people will see how friendly you are and want to talk to YOU. crazy right? i know, im there. And most importantly, if they dont want to talk to you, dont dwell on them, stuck up bitches, there's the door|`|i03qjBEfaa	Its normal. You really can't approach something like this thinking "alright time to get a girlfriend". Just think of it as talking to a friend. This way you'll get to know the girl toe. This will ensure that the girl you ask will be the best choice. Do not rush things. If you do you could wind up hurting yourself. Take things at your own pace, work the way you, not your friends, you were designed to work.|`|trpvcTBiaa	You are shy and nervous around them because you feel like you might say something wrong. You should just force yourself to talk and stay calm.|`|0w9tY32uaa	that's okay that your scared. <br>  i actually dont like obnoxious guys who are always talking....<br>  so the right girl will find you soon enough.|`|lRnk1uwSaa	tht is natural i have the same problem but u just have to be confident and say to yourself tht u can do it. if u learn to talk to them now then it will be easy for the rest of your life. i personally am going to switch schools next year and no a lot of girls (via my friend) i too am nervous but i no tht if i can be confident and learn how to talk to them and just hang with them then everything will be okay. if your friends no them then ask them to start off tallking to the girls and then u can ease into the convo little by little. try to be funny and just yourself. JUST GO FOR IT AND OPE FOR THHE BEST THTS THE WAY ITS GONNA BE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE SO FIGURE IT OUT NOW>hope this helps|`|6lT9HmPqaa	Being scared is a big part of the whole game here. Would you really get any satisfaction out of being with girls, if you didn't have to work at it somewhat? That's part of talking to them.<br>  <br>  You want to know what's scary? Looking back at life and realising you were to scared to talk to girls. Would you rather feel rejection when they shut you down, or would you rather feel regret when you reminicise about all the chances you had to talk to girls, that you never took advantage of?<br>  <br>  Speaking from experience, regret hurts a lot more. So if you want to sit around and drown yourself in your own fear, by all means go ahead. But when you're older you're going to be kicking yourself. Time and beauty are fleeting, and you're wasting both with your fear. Take a deep breath, go over and talk. No fear, just talk. Your instincts will guide you if you know well enough.|`|JgEhGpydaa	say hi and compliment her it alwats works!<br>  answer my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsE1WpcTEgD4VI.isgtG3._sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225131321AAPdXTv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NzuQnd5Naa	Just suck it up and do it.

If you want to be comfortable with girls though, I can honestly say practice makes perfect. Maybe you should start out slow. Take a day to go somewhere where you don't know everyone, like the mall. Then make it a point to smile and say hi to every girl. Nothing else, just hi, and move on. Since you don't know everyone, it might be easier. Then you can work you way up to a conversation.|`|wCn9EwBhaa	whats there to be scared of? its not like girls bite,girls are just normal like us.i girl will give you respect for even having the guts to approach them.practice starting conversations with your friends and when you get comfortable with that try starting conversations with women.its a lot of practice but it wont happen over night.<br>  <br>  look up hot looking women online and practicing looking into there eyes for long periods of time with out losing contact then yiou will ghet used to it.good luck|`|cb538e4d8411f45b9e2c09441178c232aa	i am the same way with guys... and I am still single... so i dont kno what to tell you except maybe choose a girl who is a little more approachable or who you would be more comfortable talking to... just go for it because once you break the ice... it should be a little easier if you have chemistry and all that...|`|Zzz54djtaa	just joke around and not take yourself serious, remember there are many tools out there with hot girlfriends so don't get down on yourself.

I can understand that it may seem like he is trying to block you out but he is probably just in deep thought. Every person needs space and time to think and may be at the time he had something on his mind. If you are really concerned you need to talk to him. It may lead to conflict if you keep some feelings from him.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|QAEm0Yitaa	It kinda seems like he really doesn't care much. because no one would think about anything bad or something if they really loved you and stuff. if you think it's that bad, you need to end the relationship before the bad things continue.|`|Qv57dITWaa	If you can feel a spark in the relationship, then maybe there's still life in it.

dpKntiZoaa	Let's just say that it's a parental intuition that leads me to beleive that there is of course another side to the story, and we are just hearing one side of it.<br>  <br>  Your comments about the "house that's burning" and threats of reporting just confirm this for me.<br>  <br>  If what you are looking for is a pat on the back and a "poor you, you are right" - then you should ask this question to your friends.<br>  <br>  If you are genuinally seeking to find out how to solve a situation, you look for solutions e.g. have you spoken to her about how you feel and how her behaviour affects you?<br>  <br>  Have you spoken to your mum about it.  Your mum is old enought to fight her own battles<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, as your grandmother, you should show a degree of respect - and frankly I don't see any of that present.  Therefore if she is treated like this by your entire faimly, then I would have a bee in my bonnet as well<br>  <br>  Have you stopped to think why she is "following" your family?  ...... because she needs you, when you are old, then you will need to rely on your family as well<br>  <br>  I am just asking you to take a step backwards, to look at the situation with a neutral head and then try again.  Try to understand and then to communicate calmly with her.  You might find it helps<br>  <br>  P.S. - report away.  I have not been "mean" but have a different opinion than you yes... but that is life honey, so you best get used to it.  Different opinions are not by default reportable, and I will of course appeal and get it reinstated.  You need to learn that threats do not work in real life either.|`|dL4x119gaa	she's a bitter old women, there's really not much you can do.  just smile and take it and make the best of a crappy situation, she's family, she's not gonna go away until she kicks the bucket...and that's gotta happen sooner or later.<br>  <br>  (but don't lie in bed dreaming of the day it'll happen, that's not cool)|`|hrVGGB4oaa	I totally know!

If all else fails and u've tried telling ur mom try explaining ur problem to her ( in a nice way) and hopfully that'll do it. if u can, tell me how it goes. =)

7fXpLlhBaa	"Suck it up, that's what friends do?"<br>  <br>  I can't believe someone gave this as an answer. That is the worst, most absurd answer I have heard yet. SUCK IT UP? <br>  <br>  I SAY, give em hell. They have no right to talk to you like that, or make fun of you no matter if they're you're brother, best friends, or Jesus H. Christ. Seriously, stand up for yourself and show these people they have  no right to treat you badly.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't stop them- why be friends with them any longer? There's plenty of people in the world.|`|r3xuKqakaa	ignore them , they just want your attention . <br>  or you can tell them to shut up because they have no life .|`|tXNfNTg2aa	Whatever their insult is to you, just be like "Your momma was ______ last night!" they'll either think you're funny and they'll start acting nicer, or they'll tell on you...-c'mon it's 2009..they probably won't do that BUT if they do-just say "well they were insulting me and I was just trying to lighten up the mood" orr just say "Guys shut up!" and laugh it off or find other friends.|`|7ko9czaaaa	smile and walk away.show them you don,t care and thay will stop, its no fun to make fun of someone if thay smile and say get a life and stop trying to live in mine.|`|AA11502346	Tell them to stop.

This happens to me too-and no matter what it's about, I can always find a way to make it funny to me as well.  Don't let them have the benefit of the doubt-if they see that the joke isn't affecting your ego, then they might just back off a little.  When someone goes too far, though, let them know.  Don't punch them in the face or anything, just be like "Ok. Stop...you're going way too far with this, now." and if that doesn't work... "Seriously, you're just starting to piss me off now.  Give it a rest.  Chill.  Relax." and it really pisses people off when you tell them to relax or chill so it depends on what kind of reaction you're aiming for when you tell them to.  Avoid any drama, though, like going to your friend and telling them about it-it can just make matters that much worse-and it won't help in the long run.  PLAY THE GAME - but don't be a fake backstabbing b i t c h about it...no one likes that.  So try not to tell anyone-expcept your parents/an adult at the most about your drama related problems.  Hope this helped...and good luck (:|`|9oTR4Z2jaa	find stuff to trash talk back,<br>  no matter how bad it hurts them<br>  <br>  ive had the same problem<br>  <br>  the smart quiet kid who never<br>  make it a big deal<br>  stop being so Self less<br>  and no matter<br>  how bad it hurts to make fun of their<br>  faults they will eventuall understand that<br>  they suck monkey balls|`|dVJOF4Bhaa	Maybe they are just joking with you and you don't realize it, but if not, I would find some better friends, if they are your true friends, and you told them that you do not appreciate them doing that they would stop.|`|mWukMOAeaa	I'd say find some other REAL friends.

TPZZESeeaa	one positive thing is that you get to spend more time with your father(obviously). you get more time to plan the wedding is another good thing. also you get to see apart of the world many people would die to see. hope i was positive enough, keep your head up|`|tGEHK7TTaa	Well, based on the fact that you said you have to live with your father, I take it you're under 18.  So you don't really have much of a choice.  My advice is to make the most of it.  Long distance relationships are hard, but all relationships are.  Spend this time apart really getting to know who are you, and who he is before you become a "we" for the rest of your lives.  <br>  <br>  Write long romantic love letters, send him packages of cookies or things he'll love or that will make him think of you.  Make new friends, finish school and it will be time to go to college before you know it.  If you guys are still together and happy, plan to go to college near each other.  If you decide to break up, then just let it happen, and when time has passed, meet up and see if anything is still there.<br>  <br>  Sometimes in life there are situations that you can't change, and you have to just make the most of them.  I'm so sorry for your loss and I wish you the best.|`|DZ74vzgNaa	First, I'm sorry about your mother. Now, you want to see your boyfriend right?

It might be as simple as an apartment?<br>  I hope this helps somewhat. Never give up and I hope that mess gets cleared.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Read the additional stuff. Let's try this. Raise money still so over the years you can build up enough money to see your boyfriend. Yet, you'll have time to bond with your father.|`|cMyPQ90vaa	well if your of age than why don't you just move in with your boyfriend and than you'll can plan your wedding.... good luck and sorry to hear that you lost your mom. :( just keep your head up.|`|ofpZPjMNaa	maybe you should move in with your boyfriend!<br>  orr encourage your dad to move back!<br>  &maybe jus move back and get a crib of your own!<br>  <br>  okay well goodlucck:D
MNa3e8Mdaa	that sounds normal! just go someone when you are mad!|`|UjajMHH4aa	i just went through the exact same thing with my boyfriend. His mother was overprotective and nosy. She always had to know everything. He is 18 years old and i wasn't even allowed to come over unless she had a weeks notice-just to visit! god forbid sleep over, she would never allow that.<br>  He moved in with me, but we were still followed by her, she rang him constantly, needing to know every minor detail of his life. It got so bad that he and i started fighting because of it and it caused so much stress on our relationship. He moved out, because of his mothers influence, and then last night broke up with me because our fighting was causing too much stress.<br>  <br>  Honestly, for the sake of your relationship and your own well being, you need to stand up to her. Tell her that you are an adult now and that she has no control over your life. By the sounds of it, you moving out and getting a boyfriend is probably the best thing to happen to you. Don't let your mother control your life, and if she starts yelling at you either leave or tell her that you would love to have a relationship with her but the way things are you're not sure if you can.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend, well as of last night ex-boyfriend, couldn't resolve his issues with his mother because he couldn't stand up for himself, and his issues became my issues, and now even though it's not my problem anymore, i still stress over it. I think that maybe you should see someone for help, but remember that you have to take control over the situation.|`|1D6LY5b5aa	There is something more and I think you need to go to a therapist with your parents.

You also need to respect yourself.|`|yICddWuoaa	Well from a guy's perspective I sort of understand why he's like that.

Don't try to be something you are not so others accept you.  I use to do this. I acted one way for one group of friends & another way for other groups of friends.  It was so hard trying to keep this going.  Eventually you get tired.  Plus I realized that my friends liked who I was pretending to be, but they did not know the real me.  So I don't know if they really liked me or just the person I was pretending to be. Once you be yourself no matter who you are around, you will gain a connection with other friends who can relate to you.  You may also loose some friends who don't' feel the same way.  But it is such a relief not to have to pretend.  Good luck.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	It's better to be know as a good person by many than to be held on a pedestal by one.<br>   Your true friend will come from the many who you have helped, because they will see you need someone. <br>   Being fair and balanced is a tough job. God is your friend and will always be there for you.<br>  If you are looking to become more socially active with a group, find one that excepts you for who you are, and is a group you can relate to.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless

Help her with her self esteem and social skills.  Then let her talk to her 'man' and see how that goes over.  Keep working on it until her shyness is gone and she can handle a relationship.  Also remember not to pressure her into thinking she has to have sex since she's sixteen and wants to be in a relationship - that can really scare someone.

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Well if you get breaks call her to say "hello" for a minute.  I know time is an issue but, you could stop to pick her up flowers or call and have them deliever (ocassionally) if your job is doing well.<br>  <br>  Explain to her this is for the best for your family and you do miss her when you're gone.  However, as a husband you want to provide for her.  Make sure you BUDGET wisely and SAVE your money.  A baby costs about $10,000 at least w/ no complications on either part.  <br>  <br>  I would also ask her during your work shift days what she'd like to do over the weekend.  If she doesn't come up w/ anything suggest a moive and dinner or a game night, something you both enjoy doing together like I sugeested or unique to you both.  <br>  <br>  Communicating w/ her is probably the big issue.  I know my Grandpa worked as a foreman for 5 years and she didn't like it.  lol.  They got through it I think because of communication and knowing it was the best they could do for their family.  <br>  <br>  Communicate w/ your wife.  If you want kids hopefully you can get the most of this work out of the way eairly.  Then when you get up for the next promotion see if you can work of the hours to have more time w/ your family.  <br>  <br>  That is my advice.  It's the little things like hugs, kisses, doing dishes, sorting laundry, brining home flowers, just little things that will make her feel special.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NB4h4jTyaa	It's sweet of you to worry, but your marriage can survive shift work pretty easily. Realize that you're a team and you both contribute to the success (or failure) of your marriage. It's nice to do special things on your 3-4 days off, but I bet what she'd really appreciate is help around the house on those days. During the 2 hours you have with her on working days, just time together should be enough.|`|AA11103763	Text her phone, leave her love notes, find little ways like that to let her know that you are thinking of her. Plan your time so that when you have time off, you are focusing on her as much as you can. <br>  You can make it work, but you need to make sure that you pay attention to her needs. <br>  Congrats on the new job!!|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	If she loves you she will understand that it can not be helped.  Get her some flowers sometime.  Tell her you really missed her all day.  Say and do the little things that mean a lot to a woman and she will be okay.  It is not always the time you spend with a love one but how the time is spent when you are together that really counts.|`|XZwkLeZ9aa	Compliment the way she looks.  Notice what she wears and looks everyday and honestly tell her what you think.  Go out w/ her somewhere you both like during your day off.  Catch up on your fav shows together then.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Honestly?  I think she will need to make you feel special.  Be kind and considerate to each other.  Things will work themselves into a routine and you will learn what each other needs at the appropriate times.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	first, what a great husband you are! <br>  best way to make her feel special is to kiss her like you mean it, tell her that you love her like you mean it and surprise her with stuff every once in a while.  <br>  for example, she wakes up and on her pillow is a love note from you.  (or hide one somewhere she won't find right away).  etc <br>  give her a flower.  and put some time aside for when you  do have time off to go on dates or have time for just the two of you.  <br>  good luck with your job
pVnUhYLQaa	Tell your parents, then police<br>  <br>  seriously, not to be an @ss, but Yahoo answers is the first place you thought to go after being raped?|`|fC8OPOTkaa	phone the police and break up with him if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  stay strong <br>  <br>  :) XXX|`|KNpUc7wKaa	I am so sorry to hear this happened to you. You are not alone however, one in four women get raped during her lifetime in the US. However 80 percent fo the rapes go unreported and 80 percent of the rapes are done by boyfriends, ex boyfriends, husbands and aquiantences.<br>  <br>  I am happy that you realize that it was rape. When it happened to me I couldnt come to grips with it for months. Most women are in strong denial when this happens. It is not uncommon for women to feel guilty and wonder if they did anything to cause it. Please be aware that there is NO excuse for rape and that you have done nothing to deserve being raped. Right now I presume you have mixed emotions and feel dirty and embaressed. I presume you are scared to tell your parents too because you feel ashamed. Or you might feel completly numb at this point. It is normal to feel this way.<br>  <br>  This is the best thing to do and you can do then in the order that feels right for you.<br>  <br>  1) DO NOT shower or wash your clothes for the time being. It can be used as evidence later.<br>  <br>  2) Contact the police department. Tell them your boyfriend hurt or raped you and if they can send over a female officer that you can talk to and maybe later bring you to the department. The police are very sensetive on this matter contrary to popular belief and you WILL be treated fairly and warmly. The police officer will most likely ask you to come with her so they can gather evidence. You can choose if you want to press charges later but please collect evidence before you make up your mind. The police can also from there direct you to a concelor who can help you process and later overcome the trauma.<br>  <br>  3) Tell your mum or dad or both at the same time what has happened. They will most liekly get a little upset but not at you. They will be very happy you told them though. Trust them. They can be a great resource even though you might not think that right now, and they can support you and help you deal with this emotionally later.<br>  <br>  4) Call your local women shelter or the rape crisis hotline. They have dealt with this many times and are very knowledgable and understanding. <br>  <br>  <br>  Once again I feel you pain. Please do what is right for you. It might seem like a scary process but your (ex) boyrfriend has problems. He WILL do this again, if not to you someone else. It could even be a small child. Please prevent this and report this. I know you probably love him dearly but you are in NO way responsible for this ok? Tell yourself that until you believe it ok? <br>  <br>  Best and dearest regards<br>  Anna<br>  <br>  <br>  PS if your ex calls you do not pick up the phone. Do not have any contact with him.

d7bJIgqlaa	That was wrong of her...BUT, if they were saying anything rude about her, giving you a hard time for talking to her, or being silly to disturb your conversation that may have really hurt her feelings.  She probably just took it to heart.  If they did any of those things apologize, but tell her that you really feel she went overboard writing rude things to them on Myspace.
utAXbe4eaa	Hiya :)<br>  My advice to you is to go over to him while someone else you know is talking to him. that way you can join their conversation & get to know him.

Good Luck x|`|FCmuA1KEaa	Based on looking at him, try to figure out what he might like and take it from there.

You should just honour the friendship you have with her now because if you do become a couple and break up sometime in the future, I can guarantee the friendship will no longer be the same.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	In my opinion as a girl I think you're now in the Good Friend Buddy context  sorry but it's just how I see this|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Do What The Dude Above Said :) Dudeee|`|AA10772154	Don't push/ She may just want to be friends with you but nothing else.<br>  Or simple tell her how you feel and let her decide if you are right for her or not.- If, like you say, still likes somebody else, respect her feelings and look for another girl. No sense spoiling a good friendship.|`|YaM8Elxtaa	If you love this girl then take her from these other guys. She probably likes you better anyway. Friendship is a great foundation for building a strong relationship. Don't wait around or someone else will take her. Tell her how you feel. She is not going to leave your friendship if she is really a friend.|`|w7g4eGqFaa	I SAY YOU SHOULD FIGHT FOR HER.<br>  lifes short. TAKE A RISK and maybe it will work out(:|`|lnkOwDvmaa	I don't think you have anything to lose here if you go after her. Look at how I see your options:<br>  1. You do nothing and be miserable watching her with other guys and pretend to be just friends.<br>  2. You do something about it, she rejects you and it ruins your already nonexistent friendship (because it's not a real friendship if on your part it's something more)<br>  3. You do something about it, she rejects you but somehow you keep what's left of your "friendship"<br>  4. You do something about it and it works out!!!<br>  <br>  <br>   I'd do something about it just to see what happens|`|vyC8cqrlaa	ask her out 1 night, then take her back to your house and ask her if she wants a cup of coffee or tea or woteva she lyks get close to her look at her eyes b4 that talk about sumthing romantic get your face close up 2 heres<br>  then snog her and take her to bed and have s*x.|`|vzTGbBCfaa	What's with the lad thing?  She like most girls like the "bad boys" always the ones you can't have,  You can tell her how you feel but my guess is she doesn't look at you like that, sorry.|`|ppWXraSHaa	You like her..... so you should let her know to see if you have a chance. so I'll say it like the movies, GO FOOOR ITTT TIGERRRR!!!! YOUUU CANNN DOO ITTTTT! =D|`|LMgwiS1daa	First you need to decide if pursuing a relationship with this girl is worth possibly ruining your relationship.  I do not know your age, but I'm assuming that you are between 15-17 years old.  At that age, it's unlikely that you will find your soulmate, but stranger things have happened.  I say go for it, make him jealous, and make her hungry for your attention.  Girls love attention.  Give her a small token of your appreciation for a great date.  Ask her out again, bring her a single rose, stupid chessy stuff.  The best thing that will happen is she tells all of her girlfriends about how great you are, and then you are such a sweet guy.  Be sensitive, but don't be a wuss, stand up to this other "lad."  Show him that you are into her, and possibly tell him to give it a rest that he's got a girlfriend and should consider being faithful.  I know it's hard to take advice and act on these things...especially in high school, but hey stranger things have happened.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she really needed to do away with these letters if she didn't expect anyone to find out her secret. can't turn back time, or un ring a bell, he already saw the letters, the damage is done. however if this happened before her marriage, its the past. but i would be concerned about her reaction and that she thought he was snooping and somehow doesn't have the right to be angry and confused. everyone has a code of morals, and beliefs that they live by, and for some this would be a major turn off. if it were me and i knew my husband had been with another man it would absolutely turn my stomach inside out.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I feel that you seem too involved in his relationship...I think I would be upset if my husband was discussing intimate problems like this with a female friend. I think it is their trouble not yours so you should not be worrying about it.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I don't feel that one has to tell what has happened before another came along. Everyone has a past but they don't have to let one know what all has happened. As for one marring and becoming one, I agree but one also has to have their own personal space and I feel when you look for something you find something. Rather it be what you suspect it to be or something else after the other explains what it was you found. I would just ask her about it maybe she is ashamed of it or something and never wanted to talk about it. I'm sure she has a reason for not saying something.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	If I were in this situation I would be furious. I think your past is a big part of who you are it it seems as though his wife was hiding that she had a serious lesbian relationship. You shouldn't ever hide anything from a spouse, it can damage your marriage forever. He has ever right to be upset. This is something that is going to take a lot of energy and effort to get past. The fact that she held on to those letters and hid them is reason for concern itself.|`|I814g6ZBaa	What she did before their marriage is HER BUSINESS.<br>  People are only obligated to tell what they wish to tell their partners, unless it has to do with their mutual health.  <br>  I wouldn't say its no big deal, but he doesn't need to turn it into the end of the world -- they need to talk about it and MOVE ON.<br>  And, yes, he DID invade her privacy --- which married people are entitled to retain.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	What does she have to hide exactly? What if he had found out a year from now some other way? She's upset because of GUILT. Were these letters from when they were together or not? If you're not some stupid kids or evil, you have no secrets such as this from your husband or wife.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	If this is a relationship she had prior to being with her husband, then it's really none of his business.  Not telling him is not lying, it's just not telling.  I certainly did not want to know all about my husband's ex girlfriends.  We all have a past - and this is hers.  As long as the letters are not current, then he has no worries.  It was an invasion of privacy.  Being "one" in marriage does not mean that you lose that privacy.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	the past is the past let it go. she is married to him and no he shouldn't went nosing around, if he trusted her. she has a right to have a relationship BEFORE him and not tell him but she should of got rid of the letters.|`|34b40Vu3aa	She should have told him.  If his beliefs do not align with hers it can be devastating to the marriage.  In any case, they are married now and that other relationship is of the past.  He needs to communicate his hurt to his wife and explain why.  Whether it be because she lied, or because she is bisexual and he does not agree, or a combination.  They need to talk about this in a positive way and they both need to be understanding to one another and open to each others beliefs.  Even if he does not agree with her sexuality he made a commitment to her and must learn to deal.  You, need to back off and just be a supportive friend to BOTH.  He is one with his wife, do not separate them further by taking sides.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Well somehow, the letters were found and read and it really doesn't matter as much as how this came about - as it does the fact it speaks to a masking of feelings - that of his now wife with another woman...what's up with that?<br>  <br>  Indeed, they both should be upset - and she should "get" that he is completely surprised, shocked and baffled by her former liaision...WHAT MAN WOULDN'T BE?<br>  <br>  May be privacy was invaded (did he actually have to search to find the letters or were they highly accessible?  I'd say some fault probably lies with her in this regard as well...)<br>  <br>  Really an unfortunate situation in my opinion..IS SHE BI???  -Can he be assured she ISN'T?  I'd sure as hel* wonder...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Well, if the letters are from the past, that is all there is to it really.  It is her past.  <br>  <br>  Maybe she should have told him about the past relationship, but is it really a huge issue...enough to break trust in the marriage?  And how did he come across these letters anyways?  Yes, you should be open with your spouse but everyone has their little secrets.  My husband knows about my past in a vague way.  He knows the number of men I have been with.  He knows how many serious relationships I have had, but he doesn't know how many guys i "casually dated" or guys that I had a whirlwind romance with.  He cant name you every guy I have ever slept with.  He can tell you that I have had four partners in my life, but not their names or even really a timeline of them.   He knows about the serious relationships in my past but not the guys that I rebound relationshiped with for a couple months.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Should we not think that she was trying to change her life and leave the pass in the pass, there is nothing wrong with that. But she should of gotten rid of the letters. The pass of some one life is of know one business, unless the person wishes to bring it up. For we are to learn to forgive one another. For the lord say If ye do not forgive, nor shell I forgive you of your trust passes. Let it be,  she has proven that, that was not the type of life style that she wanted and married an man. Her husband should be grateful for what he has and forget and forgive her of her pass. Remember that she did nothing wrong. He Did, it seemed like he for some reason did not trust her ,and went thru her stuff that was put away but should have been thrown away. So truly were is the trust in this relationship.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Has she told him that she is a lesbian?  Is she planning on having bisexual relationships in the future?  If she is planning on remaining faithful to him, and has no interest in having relationships with women in the future, then for me it would be forgivable.  The time for people to question and experiment with their sexuality is before marriage, and if she was questioning herself, it was better that she figured it out before her marriage.  <br>  <br>  What I am not sure of is whether she was with this woman while they were together as a couple.  If so, then yes it is a betrayal and you can forget everything else I just said.
el8yX5q3aa	uh...sexual activity IS SEX....don't misrepresent it.  You sound like Clinton!<br>  <br>  Second...she is under a lot of stress.  Relax...talk to her about it..but goodness....she was ill and now under stress.   She may very well be the puppet of her father and step mother right now.  Leaning on her too much and forgetting she is the child and not a marriage counselor. <br>  <br>  she can very well be stuck in the middle.  TALK TO HER....tell her how you feel and tell her you don't want to put pressure on her but you are feeling like this relationship is suffering a little and you need to talk about it.  Ask what you can do to help right now....instead of accusing her.<br>  <br>  People under stress lose a lot of interest in things that are normally part of their lives.  They deal with what they have to deal with and fake the rest.<br>  <br>  Talk to her...give her some comfort...some support and don't demand anything right now.  Just offer to help as much as you can.  <br>  <br>  She just may not have much to give right now....if you love her...try to understand and give her a little room right now.  TALK TO HER!!!!!!|`|umhMpKz7aa	first of all, i am so proud of you for your committment to stay a virgin. it is truly the best gift to give your marriage partner. i remember being in a relationship and my parents splitting when i was also around 19. i felt like my world fell apart on the inside. it felt like i had no "home" anymore and made me feel really insecure. I look back and think about that age...your just leaving home and need that stability to venture off. she may have serious trust issues, trying to work out the failure of her parents marriage and her own relationships. my advice to you...listen when she wants to talk, offer her a "getaway" when she is with you, confirm your stability and affirm her worth. she needs stability and freedom to grieve over the death of her family. she will work through it...beleive me women are not like men...sex is not the most important thing to us...stability and love is. she is not concerning herself over that right now. so, be the best friend that you can be and allow time to heal her wounds.Good luck.|`|5ua3E8lLaa	just be there for her, she is going through a  lot and sex is not what she needs. so wait and you will see, if she really loves you like you love her she will make that day special for you.....|`|zPPYGv7Daa	Trying stepping way back and letting her make the first move on everything.  Don't call her, wait for her to call you.  She may be feeling scared in that she thinks you love her way more than she loves you. Give her space and let her figure things out. Don't smuther.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	Well either she is losing interest or she needs some space to deal with things. I would have a sit down chat with her, tell her how you feel. If she needs space give it to her. Tell her you are there for her no matter what anytime. See what she says. Tell her that if she doesn't want to be with you please be honest and just say so. <br>  <br>  Better to know sooner rather than later. If she doesn't want to be with you, it will hurt, but it does get better.|`|yeSeoIbjaa	Ok, I have had my appendix out too, and anyone who has been under general anesthesia has a huge amount of very toxic drugs to filter out of their system.  Not to mention they almost always use morphine for the pain in the recovery phase of any surgery.  If you research the effects of anesthetic's and morphine and the after effects, you may be shocked at the length of time it takes for our bodies to really recover.  She's not going to be the girl you knew for many weeks, trust me it is not you it is the hard drugs they put in and don't really inform you of all the nasty side effects or the duration of the process of elimination.  Knowledge is key to understanding what she's going through.  She won't even know why she feels less than her usual self.|`|DAEZeOJ2aa	If she won't come out to you. Next time you get the chance take that home run. Women need attention so give them what they want. Take her somewhere special and get her relaxed and she may come clean|`|F2lUn0moaa	I know you won't like hearing this, and I am not being condescending, but you are soooo young!  I am old enough to be your mother (46 years) so I will tell you what I would tell my own children.   Communicate, communicate, communicate!  I believe that you are totally in love with this girl and don't want to loose her.  Please don't feel insecure about your virginity.  From what you have said, I'm not certain it has much to do with her avoiding you.  I think you should talk to her without the pressure of when you can see her again.  Let her know that you are just a phone call away if she needs to talk.  Send her short, one line, text messages to let her know you are thinking of her.  She may just need some space.  18 years old is a very pivotal  time in a person's life and it already sounds like she has her hands full.  She just may not have the energy to put into a relationship right now.  She is sending you signals.  Let her know you're there, give her space and enjoy YOUR life.  If she loves you, she'll come around!

He needs to look in the local paper at flats to rent or even some estate agents have them on their books. When he has found one he will need to get a form from the local benefits office and fill in the housing benefit form to get the rent paid.

You need the stability... believe it or not.<br>  <br>  You need to get a job (or several part-time jobs) and save your money. That should keep you out of the house and out of your mom's orbit most of the time. <br>  Get a bank account to put your money in.<br>  You don't mention your age, but you need to prepare for when you are 18... you need money to put a deposit on your first modest flat and utilities, as well as other things you will need to set up a household. Graduate from school.<br>  <br>  The way to keep peace with your mom is to just leave as little indicator that you are around as possible... you clean up after yourself, stay quiet, stay out of trouble, do your own laundry, and don't attempt to debate anything with her or her BF, or defend yourself. The way to play this is through "submission"... in other words, when they are yelling at you, you just nod and say "uh-huh" and "yes, ma'am".|`|XadcGNGnaa	Look around for homeless centers, you may not be able to sleep there but they provide food. Especially in London as there are many homelessness people. Some homeless centers have sleeping accommodation but others may just do soup and daytime things.

But until that happens find a homeless center.<br>  Good luck :)
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	my first husband never stopped the cheating not even when he married the second wife, until he became ill, and couldn't get out to cheat anymore. being sick all the time, having suffered heart attacks, diabetes, and inability to walk well due to back surgery, i think he finally gave it up. the fact his wife toted a gun in her purse did make a difference also. what came as part of our everyday life when we were married, he soon decided it was just too dangerous to keep doing.|`|8dhe15MUaa	some never i no some one he nearly 60 and cheating he been wed over 40 year|`|AXbdNdPzaa	When he can't get it up anymore.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	some people never cheat<br>  <br>  some people stop cheating when they meet someone really special they don't want to lose<br>  <br>  some people stop cheating when they lose someone they really value<br>  <br>  some people never stop cheating<br>  <br>  if you are involved with someone who is cheating right now then assume they are never going to stop and end the relationship and move on.<br>  <br>  if you are involved with someone who used to cheat, then how long has it been since they last cheated?

They're probably not going to.<br>  <br>  A person's morals and ethics are mostly formed by the time they're 18, a bit of development MIGHT occur between 18-21, but that's very minimal.<br>  <br>  Once a person has decided their morals, it takes a radical, life changing event, usually a tragedy in order for them to change, and even then -it's very rare. You can change your style, your speech, your look, and you can even become more intelligent... But your morals are very deep and ingrained, if you're over 21, and you're cheating... You're probably always going to be a risk to do it again, be it in your mind, or in real life. If you've failed to be faithful once, if you've been weak to the urges before... You're probably still the same person you were when you did.<br>  <br>  There's the age old saying "Once a cheater, always a cheater" I'm huge on giving people every opportunity to change... But this is one area where folks usually don't end up making a change. It's sad, but that's how life is.|`|82tgfHzqaa	It's not an age thing, it's a personality thing. If a guy cheats, he will probably continue to cheat for the rest of his life. There's not much that will stop him.<br>  <br>  If a guy is loyal, then he will remain loyal for the rest of his life. It has a lot to do with their genes, upbringing, and the influence of modern culture.|`|GByLJCfuaa	I think everyone is different. <br>  *sometimes ppl stop cheating when they have found 'THE ONE'.<br>  *sometimes ppl just cheat because they do love who are with but they have issues/problems that need fixing.<br>  <br>  but i dont think there is no set age at when people just stop cheating, <br>  ppl cheat for different reasons.<br>  ppl cheat because they are bored, or they cant commit, or they like variation, or idk. i reallly really dont know WHY ppl cheat, i hate it i think its wrong, i dont agree and definetly think there is NO EXCUSE for it. but i dont believe that there is an age at when they stop.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Some people never cheat and some people never stop cheating.  Age is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  The same people who cheat at 16 will probably still cheat at 26.  And some people cheat at 16 and then learn their lesson and never do it again.|`|Xk8PNjbwaa	Lets be honest here. There are good, trustworthy people around and then there are liars and cheats. The cheaters may not be as confident cheating when they have not got youth on their side.|`|LsFUniCSaa	People stop cheating when they grow the up and realize that they are insecure losers (what age that happens at, I would like to know because no one seems to be immune doing it)|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	If a person is with someone they don't want to be with anymore and they are afraid to get a divorce or break up for whatever reason, they'll cheat. Age doesn't matter.|`|AA11630994	Theres no age for cheating or not cheating.|`|4RTKq5t4aa	never but there are the men who don't and then there are the pigs that call themselves "men"|`|cG8cuq9Yaa	somewhere between 22 and never
AA12321514	This is more abusing than harassing. Talk to your dean or your counselor about this. He needs to be taught a lesson. <br>  <br>  You really need your voice to be heard other than Yahoo Answers.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well WHY on earth do you just ALLOW this?  You need to tell your parents and either go to the counseling office or principal yourself or ask your parents to take it up with the School Administration for you because this is NOT acceptable and should not be tolerated in public schools.  MOST districts have ZERO tolerance and this boy needs a REALITY CHECK!|`|0Id85yiYaa	tell your teacher or principal|`|lyWSufFBaa	Well If it were me I would beat the $%&^ out of him but don't do that because I don't want you getting into trouble.  What you need to do is tell your parents or guidance counselor.  His behavior is inappropriate and should be stopped immediately.  <br>  <br>  Sexual harassment doesn't always have to be physical, it can also be verbal.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, I was going to agree with Opetke until he told you to get VIOLENT. Don't do that. He's right, though. This is bullying, not sexual harassment. Go to the guidance counselor.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	You need to tell your parents, and you need to tell the principal.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	That's not sexual harrasment.<br>  <br>  It's called bullying.<br>  <br>  Good Lord we've got to get these political terms out of our children's heads!<br>  <br>  You want him to stop, fight him with your fists. <br>  <br>  We're all equal after all....right?|`|HL8PEDFLaa	First off is to tell your parents about this, and they can accompany you to the school's principal to make it known to supervisors so they can watch out for this jerk. If things do not get better, then file a formal complaint or get a restraining order with the local law enforcement. Don't think that it's not too serious because you are absolutely right, this is sexual harassment and any form of it is a crime. Not only that, but if your school has zero tolerance for bullying, you can get him suspended or expelled. It needs to be handled immediately, good luck to you.|`|TI65WNunaa	Don't wait any longer, I know you may be scared but obviously you are going to have to get adults involved.  Tell your parents exactly whats been going on even if you played any part in the beginning you have to tell.  I know how it feels to get bullied don't keep it inside any longer.  I finally had to tell on a boy that did and said things that were not appropriate.  It felt much better when I went to school and did not have to worry about this person.|`|AA10928214	Talk to you're parents, Talk to the principle, and make sure they do something about him. If you don't he's just going to keep bullying you. You should be able to go to school and feel safe, definitely not have to deal with some asshole.<br>  <br>  <br>  VERYITALIANGUY- How is that not sexual harassment? IF you had a kid would you want some jerk off at school calling you're daughter a lesbian? A whore? <br>  you're uneducated.. that's for sure.|`|3vnayfR7aa	I probably would've slapped him but don't do that.<br>  <br>  Report it to your principal and don't do what I would've done, then that means you'll get in trouble too.<br>  <br>  Some guys are just jerks, it sucks, but report it and then ignore it :)|`|AA11103763	Report him to your teachers IMMEDIATELY. You should not have to deal with that kind of abusive behavior from anyone.|`|GXOy8rjqaa	Talk to your parents.  You could also talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor.|`|PbESvbu6aa	talk to the principle|`|B2cvkTp7aa	Take a tape recorder (one of the mini ones) to school with you like in your purse and keep it on record when he is around. When he calls you some name, say "HIS NAME, why would you say that to me"? So you have proof it is him.<br>  <br>  Then once you have a few of those on tape. Talk to your parents and have the school principal and counselor have a meeting with his parents. This is a serious issue. <br>  <br>  Just get the proof on tape, b/c he will say you are a liar.
m2eHPeciaa	sooo its u that doesn't want to have sex... i thought u were talking about ur man... i don't think its bad, maybe ur hormone level is low, hence low libido. have him use foreplay more on u and try new things. he's mad probably b/c ur not having sex with him. u better watch out, he may find it somewhere else if ur not in the mood|`|WTEz0iS2aa	well if u arent in the mood let him eat u out some then it gets u in the mood and you can go down on him oral is a good way to do it if u dont want to have sex or you arent in the mood and most the time it gets you in the mood it gets my girl all the time any other questions jus email me|`|An2KCMnwaa	For men yes, men value love through women offering sex first. If not it's uncomfortable having too much sperm.|`|k07IyDvwaa	well maybe your boyfriend has urges, if youre not in the mood then tell him if you could have sex another day<br>  <br>  but why WOULDNT you want to have sex?|`|mMBzpldbaa	well if you only put out once a fortnight then of course he's going to be upset! if my boyfriend doesn't give it to me at least once a day i get moody, depressed and headachey. what's wrong with at least giving him a bl0wjob etc if he needs release and you can't be bothered with sex? anyone who loves someone wants them to be happy!
F08qx2hgaa	My best friend ceased being my best friend in middle school. <br>  <br>  She sat with a bunch of "cool" kids. They were nice to me if we had to interact, but otherwise tended to ignore me. <br>  <br>  We faded out as friends, though we talked to each other over AIM. After a while, I stopped Aiming her, and it was worth it. I was letting go of something, so that it could fall apart like it wanted to.<br>  <br>  Don't support a one-sided friendship. Your "friend" isn't treating you right. He seems like he wants to move on. It's his loss.<br>  <br>  Just let him go off to his new friends, or you're only hurting yourself by hanging onto this.|`|81SHaBnZaa	Do not apologize! Why apologize when you have nothing to say sorry for? He drove YOU off and thats his problem. If he was really your friend you would think he'd act like it. If my friends did that I would tell them off in front of their other "FRIENDS".|`|dFVztW7kaa	your friend is an ***. from my experiences, I have found that trying to be friends with people like him isn't worth it. go find new friends, seriously.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Your first answer is right. My BFF is doing this to me too, but in a diff. way.. :( I feel ya buddy. I'd just ignore them when they ignore you. Hang out whenever possible and try to get alone time to talk to him about it. Hope this helps you a little, I'm sorry, I know how you feel :(|`|7ko9czaaaa	if he was a real friend he would not treat you like that make new friends, sometimes we out grow our childhood friends,
9j0UJND6aa	Its not a factor for me. Its like asking how long a piece of string is.

There's no difference to me. However, if that legendary red head temper flares up, I'm gone. I'm too old to deal with a tempestuous relationship.|`|sHuC3r8Zaa	honestly, it depends.  <br>  <br>  some just looks gross<br>  sometimes i love<br>  <br>  i would have to see to tell you<br>  <br>  however, its whats on the inside that counts ;)|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Red is hotter than ginger.|`|Dyq73ggAaa	2 me i think its ugly

bO2rzfISaa	You didn't leave and take them for their safety, right? She left. So it must not have been all that dangerous.<br>  <br>  It sickens me when people leave their kids in utter abuse, then want to use it to justify a custody claim.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Has it occurred to you that she might be depressed and suicidal because of the marital issues?  It's quite common for people to suffer terribly from depression when their marriage is tanking.<br>  <br>  If you have been the primary caregiver all this time the courts won't want to disrupt that.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Go for joint custody, and neither of you will be disappointed.  She is their mom, and it sounds like she needs help and meds.  Depression can run in families, so be on the lookout for it with your boys.  Try to keep her in their lives unless she is a threat to them.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Just keep a paper trail. Get a good lawyer and make sure you have documented proof of her attempted suicides and hospitalizations. I would think you have a good chance of getting custody, but I'm not a divorce lawyer or a judge so it's hard to say.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	The judge will be considering whats best for the children at this stage..........not what happened in the past.<br>  <br>  Your wife is clearly not well enough to take proper care of the children, and its in the kids best interest for you to go to court ASAP.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Some state's do not use the best interest statutes, so it depends. What state are you in?|`|B2cvkTp7aa	Get witnesses to your new sobriety, get a lawyer, and get her hospital records for the suicide attempts.<br>  <br>  Ask for full custody (temporarily) and for her to have visitation under supervision. Women many times commit suicide and take the kids with them. <br>  <br>  She is a danger to your children. <br>  <br>  DO IT NOW!|`|SHARt1k3aa	I think you are in good shape.  If her diagnosis is documented and suicide is one of them, then yes... you have a good shot.  I think the judge will determine who is the stable parent at this point.  Since your wife left you guys, you obviously are the stable parent.  Does your wife even argue that?
mAZi1eH7aa	You will need a good lawyer and you will have to file the application in Quebec.<br>  Good luck.|`|td6WXhv4aa	You should contact a good lawyer who can give you legal advice.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	The first step is a Lawyer.
XcxL6ZMqaa	well, if your right. you prolly do have a shot! and also, i think you should date her and text her if you know she likes you for you instead of not you. you know? so, just make sure she actually likes you as much as you like her that way you wont end up getting your heart distractd and then broken. soon enough, you wont have a heart if you dont be careful! so watch out, k? i dont know if this is the stuff you wanted to hear but this is just my opinion. i think you should go up to her and be confident but not overly confident. k? so, ya.... i hope i helped and if i didnt then ihope someone else did bye :)|`|fHA6zk07aa	You have to begin somewhere.Go for it.<br>  If her eyes are warm when she glances at you ,she probably likes you stranger.<br>  Send her a smile ,send her a rose.Say hi,ask her out ,make it happen.No fish is ever caught by keeping the hook in the boat.|`|iNXYi2kaaa	dude i understand where ur coming from cause im shy to but that don mean we still cant get the girls though!!!... yeah man introduce urself at least and spark up a conversation with her its the best start in my opionon.|`|6rXafFkFaa	talk 2 her when theres no1 else watching and just keeping talking for a while (over a number of different times!!) and shell tink your a good listener and chatter and after that it goes 4rm there|`|Qy9mH2s7aa	you should get her cell # and start texting her and then get her msn then her facebook then her myspace then her address then when you see her in class you can be like 'Haven't I been stalking you long enough to go out with you?' and she'll probably be like 'You were stalking me?' and you can b like 'Yeah. You haven't noticed? w/e so what about that date???' <br>  <br>  i have no clue actually!!! i am only 11 <br>  omg Nick just texted me!!! byebye good luck!!! :D
NB4h4jTyaa	Unless your husband is a REALLY good sport, I would advise against this. Most men hate this stuff. The magazines (Cosmo, Glamour, etc. etc.) always tout this as a great idea, but I've never met a man who looked at activities like these as anything but a potential relationship land mine. <br>  <br>  I would suggest playing board games together, going for walks, trying a new hobby before doing the activity pages.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	My husband and I often talk about current events. Last night, we were watching Bobby Jindal speech on Youtube and cracking up. Congressman Gary Ackerman's rants are also hilarious. <br>  <br>  Another fun thing to talk about is our mutual friends. We have this one friend in particular; we love him to death, but he is not exactly a very "together" guy - so we can often poke fun between ourselves at the latest antics. My husband's workmates sometimes provide good fodder for conversation, too.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of things my husband doesn't care about - like he can care less about YA, so I don't bore him with tales of what I do here. Also, he doesn't want to take personality tests or anything of this nature. And I usually get really bored when he starts talking about some techie stuff or airplanes or what this or that person said on the RV forum. So you kinda have to figure out what your spouse takes an interest in, and go from there. Some people like playing board games or cards. Others have favorite TV shows that they watch together and then discuss. Yet others read the same book, racing to see who can finish first. All of these can provide common ground and conversation material. My husband and I really enjoy the show "Millionaire Matchmaker"; we think it's hilarious, and it always gives us ways to talk about life and relationships in general.|`|lyWSufFBaa	Well I don't know of any websites but there's a book titled......<br>                                  Romantic Questions <br>                - 264 outrageous, sweet and profound questions <br>                           by Gregory J.P. Godek<br>  <br>  It's a fun activity book that helps you get to know yourself as well as your partner.
9UQlhzitaa	the best thing you can do is be kind but not in their face.Time heals things slowly but while your waiting on them to forgive you concentrate on the new ones and the 4 you got back. Don't try to buy them off but be the best at being a friend that you can be.<br>  <br>  hope it helps some good luck to you|`|uvl63dwlaa	try talking to them.very casualy but be careful...sounds like a very serious situation.
dL4x119gaa	don't even bring it up.<br>  <br>  take your punishment like an adult. don't whine, don't complain that it's not fair...just do your time.<br>  <br>  if you act like a responsible adult, they'll treat you like a responsible adult.|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	Stop misbehaving.<br>  <br>  Is it really that difficult to figure out?!|`|il9vgn2qaa	Be really really really nice to them, try to help out around the house and then just confront them about it and ask whether you can go out (:
Sfy1SnL4aa	First tell ur boyfriend that he better not break ur heart xD.....and the tell ur friend that if she cares about you then she will understand|`|E7TkNO00aa	It's so obvious that your friend is jealous of you or she wants your boyfriend all to herself. That is not a friend at all. You need to lose that friend and get back with your guy if you guys still have feelings for each other. If she is not jealous of you, then maybe she just doesn't want you to get hurt. You really need to find out. Good luck. Have a nice day.|`|b86bf6cae0048b823e2051ef1aee564faa	She is pissed at you because you are just gonna hurt yourself again, and she pretty much thinks you are retarded. And she can't pull herself away from you because you are her bestie.|`|xG2bbN0haa	She just saw you before, and knows how hurt you were. Consider yourself lucky to have a true friend who would not want you to get hurt again, a lot of people just would not care.|`|xNMPvgFhaa	You're blessed to have such a friend. She cares about you a lot and would rather not to see you heart-broken, that's why she wouldn't want you to go back to your ex. <br>  But anyway, if you're really want to go back together with him, you should sit down with your best friend and told her about your decision. Let her know that you really happy she cares about you, at the same time, tell her that as much as it was hurt, you wants to try again with your bf.<br>  <br>  Often, people around us can see things more clearly, so, it's worth it to listen to what she got to say.<br>  Good luck
HmNIluWUaa	I know sometimes parents can 'come out with things' that they regret but generally they apologise straight away no matter whos wrong.  If your dad has actually said those things i suggest you go to the police.  Does your mam live with you or is there a close relative nearby ? Is he drinking or taking drugs? Talk to someone about this.  Im not sure of your age but you have to get help if yor feeling that scared.  Childline are a free number 0800 11 11 .

He sees your best friend but knows he could have you anytime he wants?<br>  <br>   Have some self-respect and dump the slime ball.|`|6d0iJ4RQaa	The question is if you knew ahead of time that he was going to be just a "lover" and nothing else, then you should have been somewhat prepared for this.  However, if you did have deeper feelings for him, you should make it evident to him as soon as possible.  If you don't and you are just confused about the situation all together, then you should neither be mad at your friend or your lover.

I hope it turns out ok!|`|Wa1kwOHkaa	Well, for one thing, don't ever call someone 100 times.  It just makes them more piss-ed, as well as constantly reminding them of WHY they're mad at you.  <br>  <br>  Find a way to talk to them.  Tell them that you've had enough, and that if there's a rational explanation to why they're ignoring you, they'd better tell you.  Otherwise things will just keep getting worse.  <br>  <br>  Sort this out as soon as possible.  The more time you allow to pass, the harder it will be to talk to your friends.|`|fs8wMQLFaa	Hey,<br>  Talk to them. Don't text or email! In person! If you're just texting a meaningless sorry, then I wouldn't be too nice either.<br>  They won't bite you. Apologize and make things up to them. Be extremely nice and never make the same mistake again.<br>  If you didn't do anything, then just explain your story to them, apologize and be nice. <br>  Good luck,<br>  Hugs Smiley|`|VnCVkHDhaa	First things, what did you do? <br>  and your illness is stress related, so calm down mate.<br>  you need to think things through, work out how to apologise,and if they are real freinds they will understand.<br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|zU1hrRIgaa	Um, what did you do?

7fXpLlhBaa	Girls love attention (I know i do) so go up to her and start talking to her- if you're feeling really frisky, as her to the movies, out to eat, whatever. Just get the ball rolling- but it seems like she already did. ;-)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	When you see her, say hi to her!!|`|lANbovGvaa	Noooooooooo You didn't!  OMG  She's going to think you blew her off and isn't interested.  You have to redeem yourself.  Don't think so hard.  Yes, easier to say than do but really.  Ask her how classes are going, how's work, what's new with her. <br>  If that's too much you can text her if you have her number.  If you don't try to get it.  It will make your life easier|`|VuGPufs4aa	well go up to her and talk to her its really very simple probably because she would probably like to talk to you too. oh  i see you might fail . well that's up to you.|`|1RjMSbipaa	haha just be yourself<br>  dont think of her as a girl you like, but as a really good friend.:]<br>  the rest will flow naturally :D|`|qtUvirw3aa	at least say hi then asks whats up|`|t0X1cEh7aa	Say hi, and apologize for ignoring her, just explain it to her, maybe she'll say she's just shy too.

Make sure she is already alone, of if not, ask to speak to her in private.

YzgCab38aa	ask her if she want to go out with you. Practice at home in front of the mirror. The worst she would say no, big deal. Just ask when she is alone. Since you like her, she is a nice person and won't be mean even if she does not want to. When practicing, imagine that she is in the mirror and says "no". Then - "yes". And react accordingly. Wear cute clean clothes, take a shower, have a nice hair cut. <br>  Think about where to go with her, and what to talk about beforehand. When talking, do not chat incessantly, let her talk, too. Ask her questions, but not too many to show that you are interested. Find out what she likes, and talk about it first. <br>  Go somewhere low key first.|`|Siu5uiomaa	be your self get to know her and it depends some girls like shy guys some don't we're all different

You can kiss your friendship goodbye.|`|ON84EQaBaa	Oh No what are you doing, you don't date your friends b/f if he leave her for you, you will lose her as a friend, and when you look around he's dumped you for someone else, now you've lost your friend & him you shouldn't let your self get caught up like that. and if she's your friend I know you don't want to hurt her like that.|`|n9p5cycsaa	If he's willing to do that to your friend, who's to say he wont do the same to you. I dont think you should risk your friendship and reputation by going out with him. I think that you should tell your friend that he hasn't been honest with her about everything that you dont think he's the best choice for her, though you should also promise her that you wont go out with him if you mention that he kissed you otherwise she'll think you want him for yourself.|`|GChWTGNiaa	It's "want" not "wont." <br>  He's just looking to get laid.|`|mPuRl4tbaa	you dont like him, hes just really hot like you said. if he breaks up with ur bestfriend for you and you go out with him, you are the biggest ***** ever. just forget about him. friends should always come first|`|wyNVJXUiaa	I think you should have a good talk with your friend.  she should know that he is a two timing jerk and....  do you really want to go out with someone with that type of quality?|`|KZfYzhZRaa	well is she a really good friend?<br>  <br>  yes: then dint go out with him chances are you wont last very long and not only will you just get a "fling" you will lose a friend and that sucks<br>  <br>  no: then go out with him if ou really like him then it will make you happy im sure that you will hurt her a bit but you shouldn't let something like that get in the way of your happiness:)|`|4oUq24iTaa	The best thing to do would be to imagine your friend in the situation you are in now. How would you want her to handle things if she were you? Usually when a guy leaves a girl for another girl you need to think if he is going to do that to you. Would you want to end up going with him and he finds another girl he likes and kisses her then tells that girl he wants to dump you?|`|y7EoXgeXaa	i know this isn't the answer yr gonna wanna hear,<br>  but have your friend come first.<br>  that's almost always the best thing to do.<br>  <br>  i had the same thing to deal with, and i chose my friend because i thought it would turn out better. and it definitely did. he ended up being a jerk anyways. <br>  good luck.|`|2102b6ebb00d225ec8e70793af7fce4baa	Well first off you broke girl code #1 don't date other friends boyfriends or exes.<br>  If you do decide to pursue him just know she will be mad for awhile but maybe if you try making it up to her.

It might be rough for a while, but he cheated on her and she needs to know. I can't promise you a happy ending with her though because I don't know anything about her.<br>  <br>  2) DO NOT GO OUT WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!

What do the letters say?  <br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what you're asking, but if it's in regard to the support, you or your husband should show the Office of Support Enforcement a copy of the death certificate and then there is no case, unless he owes back support.  None of this should be an issue if he's been paying her support all along.  Hopefully he was smart enough to give it to her in check form or somehow so he can show proof.|`|TJezsCkHaa	I know nothing about child support and stuff,but im going to say this from a common sense point.If the kid is dead,why is the mother still asking for child support? let your husband make it clear in court that the kid is dead,and that way the money is going to the mother that has nothing to do with him,she is not his wife so what does she want exactly?|`|AA11599430	yes consult an attorney in this situation|`|WvOvoxLxaa	This has to go through the court system. He needs to contact an attorney so the support can be stopped and explain that he has been paying all along. If the mother won't tell the truth ask for a lie detector test.  You would only have to ask a couple questions and the truth would be known.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	send a copy of the death certificate to the child support agency.  i have a feeling that what they are asking for is BACK support, not current support.<br>  <br>  personally, i'd call a lawyer, have him send them a letter.  will probably cost you a couple of bucks but not much.
lyWSufFBaa	You should go ahead and tell him now.  Tomorrow is not promised and what have you got to lose?<br>  <br>  I understand you are worried he will distance himself from you but that's a risk you have to take.

A partner is someone that you can trust, is one that will let you be, is one that will enjoy the little stupid things of life, is the one that will make you laugh and will let you talk about anything. You true partner will let you come and go and will let you explore the world while offering a safe harbor.

You are sharing everything else with him why not be honest and just tell him how you feel.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I would wait for the relationship to progress. If you are just starting to Date then I would wait for a little bit, but if you are 3 months or more then you should tell him. Of course the easy answer is waiting for him to tell you first.

You never know who he is talking to when you are not there.|`|i09pUyE4aa	he probably either can't decide who he likes, or he wants to make you jealous or something.|`|yt8KccD9aa	hmmm i think maybe he likes you and hes trying to find out what his ex thinks bc ur all friends. its a little confusing tho lol i dont blame u for not knowing i think he likes you though good luck!! <33|`|nVPTmmUgaa	i think he likes you both probably since both ar best friends he wants to be more than friends|`|TDGtjXkyaa	Ask the experts!! <br>  email off your phone or email at boyadvice247@hotmail.com<br>  or<br>  girladvice911@hotmail.com|`|EfpnRLyUaa	keep him as a friend for now, until he expresses his feelings, then you can either go for it, or back off, depending on what he says|`|wSydIZ1baa	dont think about it too much. you could over judge it.. then it would get awkward, if you jumped to the conclusions. lol|`|FCgK8p8oaa	i think he likes you, but he might try to get with your friend again|`|GAfJu156aa	SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME! Ok, he deffinatly likes your friend. Sorry hun! :( But If he liked her first there's always going to be something very special about her to him. I think he used you as his rebound. Trying to see if you liked him just to make himself feel better. I think he likes her, and will probably always have a thing for her. I know it sucks alot, but that's life. Move on, find a new boy!|`|vmoqPUhKaa	Lauren,<br>  HE LIKES YOU DEAR NOT YOUR FRIEND.  Are you missing the signals or did you want it to just go away.  As a man I can tell you that when a guy or man sees something he likes he will go for it.  You were being set up from the begining.  He was trying to get to you all along.  Men are like soldiers, they find an objective (you), decide they want it(you) and then they figure out a way to get the target.  In this case he used your friend to blindside you into thinking that he wanted her instead of you.  Face it either you decide you want him and ruin your friendship with you friend or throw caution to the wind and let him come after you (do not chase him).  This all depends on whether or not you are interested if not let him know in no uncertain terms that this is not what you want.
68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	Talk to several caterers and find out what they offer.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a permit to use the park and the shelter.<br>  Are there bathroom facilities around ?<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|4POGapREaa	Please don't take this the wrong way but where do you live that $14 per person is considered high?  I had tons of suggestions ready until I read that.  The most I could do with $14 is get lunch for me & my husband at a sandwich shop.  I just don't understand what you could serve that would cost less.  <br>  <br>  In any case, I like appetizers more than plated meals especially during the Summer.  I'd rather just have bite sized things that aren't messy as opposed to sitting down with a heavy plate & fork & knife.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	If your ceremony is around 2 and the reception is right afterwards you can get away with appetizers and salad and dessert. Especially in August when the weather will be hot, people are not going to want to have a heavy meal in the middle of the afternoon. Maybe have 5-6 appetizers, 3 salads, and the wedding cake and one other dessert. Also coffee and sodas (if you don't want alcohol).|`|8JgFKfpUaa	well, like the other girl said, just do appetizers and finger food. But no meatballs or anything, because they are messy and they get EVERYWHERE!!!<br>  bahaha<br>  u could|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	I say Mexican Food it is the best,|`|I8nIewQHaa	If your doing a summer type wedding, then I suggest you do with something light. If you can afford it do it yourself. You can go to a local grocery store and go to the deli section and do platters. Maybe one with sandwiches, and one with fruit. If it's hot where you live don't do anything that can look no so good after being in the heat. Salad, maybe potato salad. Pulled pork is always a good one. I love park weddings!!!! If you are able to use the space the way you want they always turn out great! Good Luck! Oh and if you need internet help do a search for "do it yourself catering"|`|iuajtshUaa	What about a couple of options like trays of food? You could do a tray of lasagna and a tray of chicken or veal parm with maybe a nice pasta salad and a veg of some sort with nice rolls at the end.

9YlQ5HEhaa	I think you shouldn't judge her - who cares if she's been with 3 guys or 13 or 30...the point is if you like her, it doesn't matter about the past. I know my boyfriend has been with A LOT of girls but I love him and I don't care because I know it's me he's with now. <br>  <br>  So either get over it or get over yourself. It doesn't matter. Specially not when you aren't a virgin either and you aren't opposed to abortion...so what exactly is your problem? If you care about her, you shouldn't give a crap about her past.|`|4293T0LNaa	BAIL!BAIL!BAIL!BAIL!BAIL!BAIL!BAIL!BAIL!...|`|DFI5KsFAaa	Call her a dirty whore and explain what a condom is.|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Well, firstly, doubt it. If she's a nice honest girl, if she's pretty or successful, actually she could be covered in mud really and girls will find reasons to hate each other. (Boys too of course, just less cat-like.)<br>  2nd off, what if it might be true? Mentioning it or confronting her about it seems like it would only hurt her feelings. What she has done in her past to or on herself is on her terms to speak about it.<br>  And lastly, use protection all of the time, every time.<br>  <br>  Personally, it seems like quite a lot but people, or women, get abortions for a lot of different reasons. What if her health was at stake?<br>  The only thing this should even have the slightest possibility of showing is her lack of or misuse of protection, but I hope you'll take care of that.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|srAP6Vzvaa	S**lut.|`|dvgj6q6xaa	How many other women have you been with?|`|801zLB53aa	This is just a much older woman talking from experience.  A lot of people see abortion as a method of birth control instead of a life long decision you have to live with.  There's nothing wrong with liking the girl and her abortions don't necessarily mean that she's a bad relationship risk.  But her lack of responsibility might be something you need to think about - and definitely YOU take responsibility for protection if you pursue the relationship.  Don't take her word for it.  If you'd never found out about the abortions but still knew she'd had sex with even more than three guys, would you still be interested?  Don't let your friends judge her and make your decision for you.  Just be smart.  She may tell you on her own about them as your relationship progresses and you can discuss your feelings like adults.  You didn't state her age - and how many guys is too many?  How many girls would you say is too many for a guy your age?|`|msgHpgteaa	The thing is, that sort of information is highly personal to a woman. And therefore even if she had 3 abortions, but the time she had the third she would have been discreet enough/embarrased not to let anyone know.<br>  <br>  So, Im guessing the sister/sister inlaw is lying. And the fact that they would disclose such personal information doesnt hold them very highly does it? And no they cant be close friends because close friends dont talk about things like that.<br>  <br>  Maybe she's ashamed, embarrased too hurt to discuss this with you. Who knows but there is no point judging her based on some rumours... <br>  <br>  Just talk to her.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	If it's true, then she's irresponsible and disgusting at best. Has she ever heard of protection? Birth control? You need to get yourself checked out because that's just nasty.|`|KasFZL7laa	sounds like stupid rumors.  make sure you address this with her before jumping to any conclusions.
42lo3GsXaa	Well, i'm in sixth grade so I guess I could give you some pointers.<br>  Heres a list.<br>  1. nice personality, kind and caring, but not someone obsessive that calls you every 5 minutes.<br>  2.pretty (obviously)<br>  3. thin, being overweight is a HUGE turnoff with us guys.Don't be way to skinny and underweight though.<br>  4.Well, i'm not sure if this is true with all of us , but i'm pretty shy myself. So, unless someone come up to you and asks you out,and you don't put yourself out there, you probably aren't gonna get a boyfriend.<br>  5.NOBODY likes a snob. don't play too hard to get it makes us feel like your not interested.Don't wear too much makeup.Don't act overly dramatic.Don't brag too much.<br>  6.It takes a friend to have a boyfriend. Be friendly  try and make friends,<br>   in my opinion, I like girls that are interested in whats on my mind, and that i can talk to about things.<br>  give hints that you like a person, drop smile here and there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gzHqz7fvaa	Well I look for how hot the girl is and if she is nice. Rite now I'm trying to get this girl who is the hottest girl ive ever seen. I also try to make sure the girl hasn't been one of the slutty drinker cuz 2 girls in my class were caught for drinking
L6DZZ6SJaa	$35 - $40 per person for a buffet and beer, wine, soda, and water at a private room of a restaurant. We will have about 35 people there, so about $1,300 plus taxes, fees, and tips.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It all depends on the type of rehearsal dinner you want.  Mine was a casual dinner.  I wore jeans and a tank top.  We ordered 10 pizzas from Cici's Pizza.  We also had a salad and drink.  Very casual and relaxed.  We used paper plates and walked around talking in the gym that we would later decorate for the reception.  It cost about $150 to feed about 35 people.  <br>  <br>  But if you have it catered or you go to a restaurant, I'm sure it will cost more than mine did.|`|8ygky5g4aa	It all depends on what you are doing for your rehearsal dinner.  If you are planning to have it at a restaurant it could be $12-40 dollars per person, it all depends on what you are having for your meal.  I have attended rehearsal dinners at restaurants with sit down meals, buffet meals or meals at someone's home.  All have been very nice.  If you'd like to save money, have it at someones home.  You can order food from a restaurant or local grocery store such as cold cut platters, veggie plates, cheese and cracker platters etc.  Buffet restaurants can also save you money.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xuiSfzgraa	We are getting married in front of our lake in our backyard, so for our rehersal dinner we are doing it here, and just grilling steaks and chicken and then having some salads, other sides, desert and drinks...So we are getting out fairly cheap and only spending around $500.00|`|crxbob5jaa	Had 48 people at $26 per person. A buffet dinner in a nice banquet room of a nice seafood restaurant.
YbwDFvEaaa	Wow, a 25 minute shower is extensive for anyone who isn't a gorilla who has been soaking in a mud pit for a week.<br>  <br>  I would talk to your husband about it. He may not realize how long both he and his son are actually taking showers, and will make an effort to be more conscientious of it if he's made aware of the issue. Suggest that if they're shaving in the shower that they shave at the sink instead, as that can take some men a bit of time to finish. I wouldn't put a time limit on them exactly, but I would mention that a 15 minute shower would be more reasonable. Putting a time limit on showers might make them feel as if you are trying to dictate their behavior, and no one really responds well to that.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pwCUXz6Oaa	I WOULD SAY 10-15 IT SHOULD NOT TAKE THAT LONG ESPECALLY FOR GUYS NORMALLY GIRLS TAKE LONGER THAN BOYS I SPEND ABOUT 13MINS IN THE SHOWER|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	25-30 minutes... They are so refreshing and relaxing.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Are you kidding! let them shower in peace!|`|lOsYznchaa	well that is a long time in the shower, so i would talk to them about it, but don't be pushy about it. just politely talk to them about and that doesn't affect them, then you should start setting limits, hoped this helped.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	i take like 10-15 minutes in the shower but sometimes i take a bath and ill be in there 4 like half an hour lol but talk 2 them about it and tell them that thhey should take less time in the shower<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!!!!|`|FtTx6cLdaa	that is too long!!

Nothing makes up for that level of disrespect.|`|mMBzpldbaa	no way. if he cheated on me then he's dirtying my shoes by licking them.|`|ppeVenTxaa	It would probably take me a long time to forgive him because he probably would have hurt me really badly so it might take a long time to forgive him|`|YYtVd9jlaa	No way!

He begged for forgiveness and I forgave him. Though I still love him and he claims he still loves me it's not easy. We dated for a while but after he had cheated there was no trust and we fought too much. I hated let go but the relationship wasn't healthy anymore.
bbcbc6642cf0ccbebfae8003e2803141aa	That is a little hard. If they are constantly finding ways to hang out with you then I would assume that person is into you. If they are staring at you while you are not looking that may also seem that they are into you. There are more signs out there that you might be able to look for.

cB2VGhLgaa	Well, you don't really know that everyone thinks ur weird. I think when people give others dirty looks and whisper about you in front of you, they are just trying to make you feel bad, kind of a type of bullying. They want you to feel insecure and they want you to see them talking about you, it makes them feel better. <br>  Just ignore it. Walk with ur head held high and pay no attention to the people looking at you.|`|unSpTi7raa	never no they might lyk you.

To start liking your best guy friend. Well if you are sure he likes you, then hes probably just nervous to ask you out. That, or he doesn't want to ruin you friendship.So yes, take things into your own hands. You ask him out. <br>  <br>  Best of luck. As Always- Love Doctor <3<br>  <br>  (btw- i support McCain too!)

But just have fun( ;|`|X1V5Unaaaa	no its attractive. you dont try to belittle people though because i hate people like that. i am also mature for my age. im 16.|`|AA11117282	I think its great.

Everyone is different and its annoying to others that you can openly speak of politics and whats coming to the world than how many shags you've had [like the immature do]....<br>  <br>  But still have fun as im sure you do, I was pretty much into the question of science myself and find things fascinating and has to argue with  whats happening around us.....it shows you are level headed, its ok your where the normal people are...welcome to the club!!|`|dtOutCTMaa	theres nothing wrong with that, some people are more mature than others, everyone is different. I fyou enjoy acting the way you do then you should never let anyone change anything about yourself. It isn't unhealthy its just you being yourself, theres no rules saying that you must be immature as a 15 year old|`|gp2XE6zqaa	I don't think "consciensisize" is a word, but it is very good that you are mature. You might feel like you don't fit in sometimes, but people make a lot of mistakes as teenagers and that you won't miss out on. Just be yourself and everyone else will have to catch up.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	I think everybody is different and they are how they are just because thats the way you feel about things, but don't worry about, but try to be nice when you say something you might not notice but sometimes at your age is better to believe lies than the truth|`|FMWrcL4Waa	doesnt matter what others think.  if your happy thinking about that stuff, then you happy.  yeah, you might get laughed at at school, told your a nerd or something, but in the long run, youll have a better job, get paid more, and you'll be happy.  cmon, your the philosopher!!!|`|lLN8j8cAaa	wow thats just like me im 15 and me and my best friend talk about politics and everything thats happening in the world i think its really a good thing as long as you still know how to have fun and goof off every once in awile|`|ltHslyCeaa	I am 13, but many people tell me that I act in my 20's.

BEpTEb0Naa	ugh wow, that's annoying. my boyfriend is weird with his mom too sometimes, she's really rude to him but he still thinks she's a good mom. i can understand him wanting to be around her, but you need him too. are you having his child? and are you guys married or just planning on it?<br>  if you are having his child tell him to straighten out, his mom can take care of herself, but you are having a kid and you and the child will need him (even if it's not his child) he needs to be there for both of you. a year is a long time, tell him he can still help her without being there 24/7, say why don't you go over once or twice a week, and you go too, and help her out. maybe he'll slowly get out of the habit. if not you need to have a talk.|`|JTChYOpqaa	just tell him what is botherin u
xbUK7jPVaa	well , it def. shows that you care about her (:<br>  <br>  some might say violence isn't the answer, but i think it was a good idea haha
Mz1XNJxdaa	If your friend dated him previously then maybe you should talk to her and let her know you are interested him this guy. If she is ok with it then go for it. If you like this guy a lot then it should not matter about his ex who hes still in love with. If they loved eachother that much then they would be together. Take the chance.

I am sure once he sees your house laid and his look like a plain old trailer, he will be more open-minded...<br>  <br>  **Don't worry about the EX- part...

1ac7ff377a38a39ef6014d3e31201dd7aa	If you know her name, just ask her out. There is nothing to be afraid of, I have just found that out myself.<br>  say something like "I see you once in a while, but I don't know much about you, would you like to do something this weekend?"<br>  do it like on a wednesday or thursday. friday is too late, people usually have plans for the weekend by friday.<br>   good luck bro!|`|0nVowEpXaa	just work up to the fear to go up to her and say hey girls like that.|`|3RHSSEDnaa	You can not get to know her if you don't at least say "Hi!" once in a while so she knows you exist.  It is amazing how a sincere smile from across a crowded room makes you feel - if that someone becomes a special friend - even if shy.|`|KLAf9uqaaa	if you're too shy slip a note in her locker. say something like do you wanna see a movie or something like that. if you're REALLY shy have a friend ask her out for you.|`|7eI8DtuUaa	stop being shy. go up to her and ask her what she's doing on friday and then ask her out. gawd... guys are so uptight nowadays. Just calm down and ask. the worst that could happen is her saying no.|`|e7Midrsoaa	just start talking to her. ask for her number or something (just as friends) and start a friendship with her. if you dont take a chance and put urself out there nothing will happen|`|i09pUyE4aa	well idk if these are the answers you want but<br>  1) you shouldn't like a girl /just/ based on looks and how she dresses, regardless that should be a factor, but if you don't know the girl.<br>  2) you need to talk to her, just be like "oh hey"<br>  and then progress with conversations.<br>  <br>  butttt don't get your hopes to high, because you don't know anything about her, she could not be interested at all, besides friends, or she could be dating and things.<br>  <br>  <br>  being humorous usually works out pretty good, it's a lot less awkward then a full blown conversation the first day you see them, btw.|`|uRCbwSIlaa	Get up the courage to just go and do it! Honestly, as a girl, I find it a major bonus if a guy is confident enough to simply come up and approach me. Go up, say hi, ask her her name and start up with some small talk. If she's picking you out of the hallways, she's mostly likely not going to run away from you. Secondly, you're just talking. There's no possible chance for a rejection. :D<br>  <br>  If it makes you more comfortable, go with a friend at your side. There's always the option of finding her on myspace, or facebook or whatever. But meeting in person is always better. <br>  <br>  NEVER send a friend to do the introduction for you. It just goes to show that you don't like her enough to take a chance or that you've got positively no balls. XP So just go up and say hi, start small by making eye contact with her when you see her, or waving or smiling at her. Just get her to notice you. And go from there. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! good Luck with your girl! <br>  :D|`|5hKiN1xhaa	Do something that will get you noticed, maybe try experimenting with your cloths and hopeful she will   notice you.|`|sKYPWxTmaa	run into her in the hall or catch her before or after school and make small talk about classes or something. most girls like compliments too.|`|s9cT6yJIaa	The same thing happend to me too, exept I only know his name.

I know exactly what you're going through.... Basically the smartest thing to do is either become friends with one of her friends and have he or she (A girl is better to become friends with) introduce you to her. Then from there just complement her alot while getting to know her..... Or you can do the single approach and casually walk up to her and try to engage in conversation with her. Once your friends with her just simply get to know her better.. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|UcGa0nrbaa	ok this always works,when u see this girl in the hallway give her a little headnod . u cant be gay and shy u gotta make her kno u kno what ur doing so if she starts laughing or gets red or smiles u kno u have made progress then the next day just feel confident and go up and start tlking to her!!!!! believe me dude ive done this countless times!!!|`|QLfjJEUuaa	aww..........well don't be shy get out of your shell just go up to her and say hey like...start a conversation then wait awhile and she will either start liking you or she wont like you.. um...maby she thinks your cute too and is to shy to tell you...if you don't start getting to know her now she will probably go for someone else!|`|YveSbeqraa	JUS DO IT.....GO UP TO HER GET HER NUMBER CALL HER THAT NIGHT AND ASK HER TO GO ON A DATE WITH YOU THAT WAY YALL WILL BE ALONE AND NOT AROUND ALL THE NOISE IN THE HALL WAY........MAKE SURE YOUR DRESSED NICE.....YOUR HAIR LOOKS GOOD AND THAT YOUR BREATH IS FRESH......AND YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO LIL BUDDY.....GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING N I HOPE YOU GET HER.|`|Xxbs5qxbaa	One thing lol get to know her she might not be what your looking for but you should start talking to her lol. and then get a friend to tell her to go talk to you then ask her out <br>  play the cards right <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|LRJZLcixaa	you need to talk to her.  u could start by adding her as a freind in facebook (if both of u have one) and if not, just start by saying "hey" to her in the hallway.

You moved to another state to be with him but you have hardly said one really good thing about him. <br>  <br>  Also, you both have gotten comfortable and are scared to go out into the world and start dating again but you're old and smart enough to make the choice on whether you want to be with a man who has nothing but excuse after excuse OR to go find something better and overcome the fear of getting hurt.<br>  <br>  Honestly, just leave the man.

XmJZkFuMaa	No.  You can be disappointed, but really why would they invite you along too?  I used to babysit for one of my brothers on his vacations, and one time he took me, my parents, and his kids.  I thought nothing of it at the time, but it made my sister who was close to my age resentful, especially since she had a little son who she would have loved to go with us.  But the fact is, it made sense to bring me along because I was close to the kids, and my parents because they wanted the kids to spend time with them.<br>  <br>  Another year they took one of the older cousins instead of me.  I wasn't resentful or angry.  Disappointed yeah, but that was it.  I was busy by that time with school more.<br>  <br>  Money is tight.  You can't expect them to take everyone.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Who's paying for it?  Well then, relaxxxxxxxxxxx.|`|nCWjdyddaa	Absolutely not. How would you like it if someone told you who you had to invite to your birthday party? They probably only had a certain amount of room and had to make a choice. I'm sure you'll have plenty of things to enjoy with them at other times. Be gracious and tell them you hope they have a good time.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	well I can see feeling hurt. but try not to be angry, as to let this bother you. you have now found who they feel to be their favorites. the day will come when you and your family may do something and not invite them.|`|43ffb069d587a02815961cb6fd180171aa	its understandable if you're mad, but i dont believe you have the right to be.  i dont think they just didnt invite you to be mean or hateful, but some things you just wanna do with certain ppl. i don't its personal.|`|t26ctJdraa	no like the first one said its their choice. i think i would feel hurt not mad.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	no.<br>  <br>  their vacation, their choices.|`|b9e5f45fb170101f7d4d32dd87e90872aa	Yes,let them know it hurt,and then plan your own vacation so it won't hurt as much..<br>  Been there!|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	did you ask them if you could go or why they didnt invite you? just ask
517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	He sounds needy, pushy, intrusive, a bit manipulative, and moving way too fast.<br>  <br>  Your sister doesn't owe him anything. Dumping his girlfriend was his decision, not your sister's. My guess is that he probably started his relationship with his previous girlfriend just the way he's doing it with your sister. <br>  <br>  If your sister's not comfortable with him, she should feel free to dump him. If he was willing to dump his previous girlfriend, there's no reason to believe that he wouldn't/couldn't do the same to your sister. (I wouldn't be surprised if his former gf dumped him.)|`|qpAYU8Knaa	His behavior suits a 12 year old. He is very immature and insecure who will be a control freak if your sister stays with him. She should dump him if she does not like to be controlled.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	He could be obsessive-compulsive but more likely he is mentally challanged.<br>  Often those unfortunates are prone to think they are in loe almost instantly and often do not realize how much money they may be wasting on texting.<br>  Keep your eyes peeled and be ready to catch your sister if she doesn't wise up soon.<br>  If he dumped his girl to go out with her; then he will dump her to do something else.|`|xkMadpW5aa	she should tell him that she wants to be with him but she needs her space and that she feels over-crowded by him.  she should definitely talk it out with him before dumping him.|`|e7Midrsoaa	she should just text him back slower and not be totally into the love thing. hopefully hell take the hint|`|kQKFfZAmaa	she should just tell him to stop texting her all the time. doesn't he have anything better to do?|`|BAy9alNUaa	his old relationship he was in was probably a pretty long relationship. even thou he was unhappy he still had a sense of a long term relationship. It is hard to go from having that to having a new relationship. He probably physically has everything he could want in your sister but is forcing the issue to have the long term feelings with it as well. He also is probably very nervous knowing that his old relationship did not work out and has issues with trust. Not the fact that he does not trust your sister, but he may not trust that she will be there, and h has given up what he knows as a relationship with someone else to be with her. Alot rides on her and it shouldn't. It's not her or his fault. I guess the best part is he is head over heels. But its up to her if she wants to be with him. As long as he is a good guy and is working towards or has good job, i say hang on to him.|`|9LuDc9x1aa	i was with some1 exactly like that!!!!!...it doesnt been hes a bad person but it is really unattractive for him to be that needy and desperate. "baby names" thats a little too much. i think she should tell him that they should take things slower as it is a bit offputting.  if he doesnt listen, she should finish things because he will only get worse, and that may lead to big trouble xx|`|kPnVISdhaa	I think this guy sounds controlling and/or abusive. Your sis should get rid of him immediately, and maybe do it @ school or near your house with you watching so that he doesn't try to hurt her. It sounds like he liked her before a LOT and he could also be a stalker. Just be careful. Maybe you should tell your parents|`|JJAfzXLAaa	hes probably a bored stalker or sumthin like tht just flat out tell him tht u guys r breaking up- just tht it isnt really working and sorry. dont dont dont dont dont dont DONT make excuses!!! trust me! they will always find a way around it and it gets annoying. good luck|`|qT5rKKYKaa	say I need space and you cannot text me so often I am very busy if it continues don't answer. se wants something if he allready think of baby names and he went to you right after dumping someone!|`|mVUpt8waaa	She should stop replying to all his texts.  It only encourages him.

I mean the guy has got to be freaking her out, I know sometimes when I like a girl I might do alittle but not the freaky stalker thingy? And she probably has better things to do like hang out with you or do homework, it's what I do! He kinda sounds like hes trying to get down her pants and make her prego "you might want to help her out" be a good sister! <br>  <br>  sincerely: smashed up SUV dude! :)
Uj5kuzoJaa	Leave him alone. He apparently doesn't want anything to do with you anymore. Move on and try not to be clingy with him. Once he sees that you don't care anymore, he just might get interested in you again.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	He is your ex. Leave him alone. He doesn't want to be friends, he doesn't even want to talk to you.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He doesn't want to be your friend or talk to you ever again.  Get over it.

It's like oil and vinegar, it doesn't mix. "He is through with you" means that he is fed up with you, your personality and your games, sorry.

Look at how he is cheating on his wife with you...would you want him to do that to you if you married him???? I recommend that you read, The Love Dare...and try it out with your husband. Good Luck.|`|c0VZhGh9aa	Idiot. You're both married. Grow up and stop being mentally unfaithful. If your Husband knew you had thoughts of divorcing him for another man.. how would he feel?

They all say that.|`|cMyPQ90vaa	well to be honest ya'll should of never got married if all your gonna do is leave your husband or wife for someone else that's my opinion ya'll should love your spouses if they are good to you why leave them. i also think single people should stay far away from people that are married or in a relationship.|`|4QctT4uzaa	Honey I'm sorry to say this but i your married and he's married don't you think that's a little irresponsible? I really dont mean to offend you. But really, if you guys were "meant to be" then you would have married him. I think you should tell Him "I'm married" and say your sorrry|`|eO35QeTeaa	All i have to say is if he is willing to leave his wife for you dont you think he might leave you for someone else?  Dont fool yourself. This is not a good trait.|`|6c02d02bf857232422a679628b4b9402aa	Expect a crap life.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	What is your question?|`|2Xw4Tm0Taa	Great!  I'm sure you're all real proud.|`|aeLyiRczaa	Dear God, I do pray my sons never meet someone like you.|`|iL34hHr9aa	what is are you asking|`|B2cvkTp7aa	I think you should both get divorced and marry each other. Than you can cheat on each other.<br>  <br>  You are a whore, and he is the same.<br>  <br>  Your poor husband. His poor wife.<br>  <br>  PS - learn to spell
KTqdwG3Xaa	That sucks.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Approach the girl you like. Say "hi" or "hey" and ask her a question or give her a compliment. It can be scary, but it's really pretty simple. If starting conversations is not your strong point, read these articles:<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Talk to Strangers <br>  How to Come Up with Good Conversation Topics <br>  Flirt a little! Relax, crack a joke, and break the touch barrier (see How to Touch a Girl). <br>  Gauge her interest. Take notice of eye contact, smiling, laughter, and enthusiasm in her responses. Read her body language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous to touch you yet. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she likes you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. <br>  Pop the question. "Hey, why don't you come to the movies with me this weekend?" (It doesn't have to be the movies - it can be anything you're interested in, and that you think she'll enjoy too.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Another good way to ask is "I heard about this movie, _______. What do you think about it?" If she says she'd like to see it, ask if she'd want to see it with you. If she says "As in a date?", don't be afraid to say yes. If she doesn't say that, just make a time, turn up and treat it like a date and she'll get the drift. <br>  Keep your cool if she says no. Respond gracefully, like "No problem! Maybe another time. I'll see you around, OK?" And go about your business - there are other fish in the sea!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another way to go about doing it is to bail before she has a chance to respond. See How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsAsk her when you two are ALONE. Having others around you will stir pressure on her to say yes or no. <br>  Ask her out directly. Instead of texting, getting other boys to ask her out for you, or beating around the bush, just ask her. Even if you're nervous, this will increase your chances. Most girls will admire your confidence if you are not arrogant about it. <br>  Being relaxed and confident is the difference between a comfortable silence and an unbearable silence. It's natural to have breaks in the conversation. Don't sweat it. <br>  Don't be afraid of rejection! Most girls have big hearts and will not let you down very easily, if at all. Some girls agree to one date just because you asked and they're being nice. Don't take it the wrong way, it simply means she likes you enough to not hurt your feelings but not enough that she's ready for a relationship. <br>  When you do approach the girl, try not to start the conversation by a "Hey, can I talk to you?" or a "Can I ask you something?". Don't ask her out randomly, but these lines are giant hints that you are about to ask her out. This would be awkward. <br>  If she says no, just ask "Oh, OK. Is it fine if we're still friends?"<br>  Source(s):<br>  Be persistent, but not too persistent. If she turns you down gently, then she's politely telling you she's not interested. If she flat out refuses, back away. You don't want any girl to think you're a stalker. <br>  If you have to ask her out through a friend, you will get a "no" by default. Girls do not enjoy hearing, "Hey! I'm asking you out for (Name of guy). He doesn't like you enough to overcome his lack of confidence." They will hear this regardless of how tactful your friend is, unless her friend is a very close friend to both you and herself. <br>  Make sure you don't have bad breath! <br>  The worst thing you can do before asking a girl out is not even having a friendship with her!|`|ExaerfDraa	If you havent even gone out with her you dont love her, you lust for her. Go up to her, compliment her, ask her if she wants to hang out after school and watch a movie or cook her dinner and get to know her. Dont be shy, Be confident|`|6sBn3l3Maa	I suggest you keep it simple and casual.<br>  "Hey, wanna go out on *insert day*"<br>  Giving her a rose or a small gift is a little too much in my opinion.
LZoUTjE7aa	mate, i know exactly what you mean when you say youre worried about other people ruining her. but if she is as great a girl as you say, she wouldnt change so quickly so dont rush into things. its good that ur trying to look good, and that means if she liked you before she'll like you now. the best thing to do i think, is start talking to her again, get her to trust you, then tell her exactly and honestly how you feel. about everything.<br>  <br>  then see what she has to say - if god wills it then she will feel the same way too, but if she doesnt then you can either keep trying or move on, and learn from the experience. <br>  <br>  theres always more girls out there you'll like. ive thought ive been in love before, but things change. <br>  <br>  its a mad world but good luck and you sound like you deserve her (:|`|qrHUoUVQaa	Just tell her what you just told me, if she is anything like me she would automatically want to be with you and then bam!.....good luck!
SsOIrjjfaa	There is  difference between forgiving and moving on. I honestly don't think you should be forgotten. Everyone makes mistakes. It's really up to your friend on how things should play out. It's going to be hard because she trusted you and now that trust is truly gone.<br>  I hope she does forgive you, because it's closure for her. I think this needs time. She needs space to think. Put your energy in other things for now because this is out of your control. I admire you for confessing the truth. Hopefully she reads this post.|`|1kBZmDk0aa	You have already done the hard part which was confessing. That must have been really difficult.....as well it should be for telling lies.<br>  <br>  But it was also the right thing to do. I think you're too hard on yourself.  If you were still telling lies-I would say you deserve the pain. But you have confessed.<br>  <br>  Now I would give her time....but don't just give up on it....unless she specifiaclly says she doesn't want to be friends.<br>  <br>  As I said you're too hard on yourself. We have all told lies.....but unlike many people you came clean....that's all you can do.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out.|`|dTP0zNqaaa	My best friend of three years lied about everything in his past. His reason was because He was trying to forget everything he has been through, because he had a hard life. I forgave him but find it hard to trust him now. I think it would be easier to let it go because building that trust is going to be almost impossible. So you need to figure out if the friendship is worth it.
kHeXKtKraa	When I am in the situation you are in and do not know what to say, but want to mark the situation somehow, I usually simply write:<br>  <br>  I wish I knew what to say to make you feel better.  I would say it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I just write:<br>  <br>  I wish I knew what to say.  I would say it.<br>  <br>  Both are honest and appropriate for any age and any relationship, but the first one is a little more personal.  And no matter what, remembering someone's troubles or feelings with a card is always appreciated.
MzqZGvalaa	I've noticed something like this on the news etc.  If an 18 year old male does a bad thing, like hold up a bank or kill someone they are an 18year old man.  If on the other hand the 18 year old male is the victim of violence or an accident he is an 18 year old boy or youth.  I guess it's just a matter of perspective.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	LOL me too im 17 and im trung 18 in august, and well i guess it happens just because they feel like we are not little kids anymore, and they just don't know how to refer to you anymore, but it's better to be treated as in adult than a child right?
fuia2Z6Maa	no idea boss..
6b8a1d40302e7f99948906e6c4446902aa	It sounds like he is just a typical guy, and I can tell from how you referred to him as a "boy" you guys are still young. I would say if you are not ready for sex just don't give in. the fact that he questions if he is going too far or not and stops when you say know shows that he does respect you, but like I said he is a guy so he will do it again as long as he stops when you tell him to. He just can not help it, but I think he wants you for more than just sex. Hope everything works out between you two!|`|KasFZL7laa	i doubt it.  he is just a typical guy.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	If you are not ready for sex, then do not give in.<br>  <br>  If he eventually leaves you because of this, then you guess that all he really wanted was sex.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	you sound like teen so its called lust you guys don't know what love is yet hell many adults don't know what love is & mistake lust for it & yes he is a guy of course its about sex that is the purpose of date for young guys|`|BWYwsl38aa	Don't be confused! he sounds like a great guy! if he really wanted you just for sex he would have stuck it in a lot earlier! if he actually remembers stuff about your relationship that means that it actually means something to him!|`|M9LB94FHaa	OMG! This sounds almost exactly like me and my bf except we both plan on waiting till marriage for sex and things related to it. However, he always fantasizes with me about how our love life will be when we're married...seems like he just likes to arouse himself! <br>  <br>  I wish we could both figure this out =[|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	well he wants you for sex and don't give it to him trust me please don't i made that mistake before
