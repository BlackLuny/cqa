Ok, once you refridgerate them and then they thaw again to room temp, are they still good?   If the jello etc keeps going from refrigerated to room temp., several times, will that effect the quality or promote bacteria growth?   When I buy them, I put them in the fridge, but when I pack lunches they're sometimes leftover so I throw them back in the fridge....
