Dried tomatoes have a more intense flavour and can be marinated in herbs/chilli/garlic when preserved in olive oil.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Sure they can.  I have a food dehydrator and use it for any seasonings.  I dry tomatos, green peppers, onions, apples, and more.  Then I put them in my food processor to grind them up really fine.

Continue to heat, stirring, until the mixture thickens and begins to boil. <br>  Dice tomatoes smaller or puree in a blender or processor, if desired.

(Depending on the size of them it could take up to an hour or more, so you just need to check em). When they're done, you can eat em like that or mash em up. <br>  <br>  Some toppings would be butter, cinnamon, brown sugar, marshmellows, or some cream cheese and brown sugar mixed together. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps ya!|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Sure, do it like a normal potato.

(If using canned beans, rinse them and skip to step 2.) Put the beans in a pressure cooker, cover in enough water so there will be water to drain once they are cooked. Cook for 35 minutes on high pressure and low heat. After 35 minutes, allow the pressure cooker to cool. Open the pressure cooker and test the beans. If they are not done (if the beans are still a little hard) put them back in the pressure cooker for another 5-10 minutes. Note: if you soak the beans for several hours ahead of time, they will require less cooking. Make sure if you do this to drain the soaking water and replace with fresh water before cooking them. If you do not have a pressure cooker, follow the directions on the package for cooking the beans.<br>  2 While the beans are cooking cook the rice according to the instructions on the rice package. Add 10 Tbsp of butter to the rice while it is cooking for flavor.<br>  3 In a large skillet, sauté onions and garlic in 2 Tbsp of olive oil until translucent on medium high heat. Move the onions over to one side of the pan, turn up the heat to high, and brown the meat away from the onions in the same pan. (If you do not have a large enough skillet, use two separate smaller skillets for the onions and beef.) Add chili powder to meat as it is cooking. Start with one tablespoon, and add more as needed to taste. Stir in the onions and garlic. Add chopped parsley. Add one can of tomatoes. Add sliced Jalapeno pepper. Add 1 teaspoon of salt. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes. <br>  4 Once the beans are cooked, drain them. Add the beans to the meat and onions, adding another teaspoon of salt to the beans as they go in. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, tasting and adding more salt if needed to taste. Stir in cilantro leaves right before serving, or sprinkle on top.<br>  Serve over rice or with warm corn tortillas.<br>  Serves 40.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	I'm not really sure if you're asking for a chili recipe or just something with chili beans in it? Either way, if you go to allrecipes.com and find a recipe that you like, you can enter in the number of servings you want and it will automatically adjust the amount of ingredients.(Since you're cooking for firemen, I'd make the amount a little more than 40 servings since I'm sure they're going to eat more than a normal serving) It makes it really easy when looking for large groups.

A good idea for a mile stone birthday like this is to decorate with old pictures. It's inexpensive and really memorable. To make sure the originals don't get ruined, you could scan em and print them out at home or send them to wal-mart or Walgreen's (do y'all have those in england?). Once you have the copies, you can make colleges they are arranged by decade or a special event. I'm sure after 50 years you'll have lots to work with.<br>  <br>  Also, think of a color theme. It's makes it so much easier when shopping. If it's a casual party, you can get colored plastic wear, paper plates and cups.

I went to Birthdays card shop as upstairs they have a whole section dedicated for balloons, banners weights etc.. go to the venue and see how the lay out is, the best place to put the buffet table, dj and  birthday cake then estimate how many banners you need to decorate the walls and if there are tables try putting a 3 balloon decoration in the chosen colours as a centre piece so they do not need to be stuck to walls etc..after all this nip to your local birthdays and buy the stuff you want..party plates, plastic cutlery, hats, party blowers, etc.. I even bought my dad a plastic medallion and Happy wig as a laugh as he was ''SO cool'' 50 years ago lol! its not too expensive in birthdays & has a good selection and what money you save you can buy your dad a lovely cake!

If fresh pork has reached 160 °F throughout, even though it may still be pink in the center, it will be safe. The pink color can be due to the cooking method or added ingredients. <br>  If you are sure that the pork was cooked to the prooper temp initially, then you are fine. When you reheat it be sure you reheat to 165F.<br>  A good practice for you in the future would be to use a meat thermometer. It takes the guesswork out of cooking.To use just inserted into the center of the thickest part of the meat, away from bone, fat and gristle.<br>  Here is a list of minimum internal cooking temperatures<br>  for meats.<br>  Beef, veal, lamb-roasts, steaks, chops <br>  Medium rare 145 degrees F <br>  Medium 160 degrees F <br>  Well done 170 degrees F <br>    <br>  Fresh pork-roasts, steaks, chops <br>  Medium 160 degrees F <br>  Well done 170 degrees F <br>   <br>   Ham <br>  Cook before eating 160 degrees F <br>  Fully cooked, to reheat 140 degrees F <br>    <br>  Poultry <br>  Ground Chicken, Turkey 165 degrees F <br>  Whole Chicken, Turkey 180 degrees F <br>  Breasts, roasts 170 degrees F <br>  Thighs and wings Cook until juices run clear. <br>   <br>  Stuffing (cooked alone or in bird) 165 degrees F <br>  Egg dishes, casseroles 160 degrees F <br>  Leftovers 165 degrees F|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	The long time practice of concerns about pork being undercooked is vastly over stated.     Trichinosis is much much rarer in pork than it was 30 years ago.     <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that I am not telling you to serve pork like you would beef.    I am saying that a pale pink in the center is what to strive for when cooking loin or tenderloin.    <br>  <br>  In terms of the color change from white to pink, that is odd.   <br>  <br>  I suggest a probe thermometer for cooking loin.    Take the roast out at 155f (to allow caryover temperature rise to 160f)|`|eL268hETaa	Pink pork isn't healthy because undercooked pork can make you sick if the meat happens to contain trichinosis.  If the meat was marinated, it can turn grey or tan colour. If you cooked it and sliced into it, then stored the leftovers back in the fridge, the inner surfaces of the meat (and the blood) got reoxygenated and turned pink again...  Meaning that you likely did not cook it enough the first time.  Perhaps the lighting in your kitchen is different at night and it merely LOOKED cooked last night...<br>  <br>  Anyway, just microwave the leftovers, slap it back in the oven, or sear the slices in a skillet to the desired degree of doneness before you eat them now.|`|mb2eeqhfaa	meat tenderizer. but if i were you i wouldn't eat it. it must be bad. try covering it a different way

fwnqB0dTaa	You need to rehydrate, and replace sugars and salts in your body.<br>  <br>  Any electrolytic drink is what you need, the same sort of thing sportsmen/women drink after an event.<br>  <br>  Ignore the bread comment, any alcohol that was in your stomach/intestine is gone now so theres nothign to absorb, and it would just be absorbed through the intestine, with the bread, anyway.|`|mo8YBvC4aa	ginger ale, a sandwich, m/b some sort of fruit|`|1NF6f4y7aa	You should make sure you eat something for sure before going to work to begin with.  Your boss and employees can smell the alcohol if you are on an empty stomach...   It happened to me and the hangover gets much worse when people start bitching at you.    I would eat something with bread for it to soak up the alcohol.  Also, fried food seems to work as well cause it also soaks up the booze.  Don't take any ephedrine or anything that makes you shake.  It is very unpleasant.  Take two aspirin every couple hours and that will kick in and help you by noon.  Eat an apple as well.  It is better than coffee, it'll wake you up.  (So they say)...  Hope this helps.  You're just going to have to ride it out then... Don't forget to drink water!  Lots and lots of water!!!|`|63899b8a7193738547e937e28a651057aa	Bread to absorb the alcohol that you still have in your system.  Salty Crackers would probably be even better b/c of the salt.

Instead eat a banana which keeps you from getting dehydrated..  Drink as much water as you can tolerate but also drink either Gatorade or Pedialyte.  Pedialyte is for kids when they are sick but it works like a charm.  Try the frozen pops of pedialyte and keep them in the freezer if there's a next time.  If you can't get Gatorade or Pedialyte, eat fruits and tomatoes which are high in Vitamin C which gets sapped from alcohol. Lastly, foods high in slat help a tom.  Try pretzels.|`|DaYqNCsNaa	If you're hungover, it's most likely due to being dehydrated.  I know that water is the best way to hydrate you, but i recommend a soda or something because the carbonation and caffiene will make you feel better.  Take some ibrofen every couple of hours.

FicyC2TXaa	Being vegan isn't about being a martyr, and you have a responsibility to deal with things that carry disease and threaten your health or that of your family.<br>  <br>  Flies, fleas, cockraches, rodents do just that.<br>  <br>   If having done your best to keep them out, you find they are still there then sorry but killing them can be the only option.<br>  <br>  There's a saying - if you followed a fly for an hour, you wouldn't eat for a week. Flies carry disease; the fly that lands briefly on the food your child is about to eat has probably just been feasting on dog sh*t or a dead mouse outside. It'll have regurgitated that onto the food, and stamped it in. Swat it before it gets the chance - you could spend all day trying to persuade a fly outside.<br>  <br>  And anything that bites me or tries to is dead.<br>  <br>  Being vegan is about minimising your contribution to the suffering and exploitation of animals as far as is possible. Risking your health and even your life, or those of your family, is not required.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Unless the insect is threatening me, or trying to suck my blood, I will not kill them. Insects, like earwigs for example (I have an unrealistic fear of them), play their role, they keep the place clean, they are great for your garden and helping growth. I put them outside if I see them inside, one time I opened up a container of flaxseed, it was already open, and I took a big spoonful of the stuff, and i nearly freaked lol, there was an earwig in it!!! I just threw it outside.

A5D62Ycbaa	They are all lovely, but with so much to buy for your home and baby it is a lot to spend on a toaster and kettle!

Bargain eh!|`|98WKYtfwaa	I love them, but not the prices. I think that's WAY to expensive for them all. <br>  <br>  You should try out other places first before getting them out there, like tesco, currys and so on you might get them cheaper lol.|`|AA11765580	These are really cute; I love the color.  I never used a microwave grill though?|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Are you sure you want things you will barely use?  Sure, they're cute-retro and all, but I keep my toaster in a closet when not in use.  I don't even have a kettle.  That's what a micro is for.  You put your coffee cup with water in the nuker and it's done in 1.5 minutes.  The microwave you should buy, but I don't see a need for a grill.<br>  <br>  I think you should think of more practicle items, like dishes, skillets, pots and pans, cookie sheets, cake pans, silver and glass ware, cooking utensils, a water filtration system, and other stuff for your bathrooms.  <br>  <br>  Having a baby means never having enough towels or soap, clean sheets, vacuum cleaners, mops, brooms, garbage cans and desk lamps.<br>  <br>  Give this some hard thought before you buy them.|`|w5uHiNcoaa	Personally I don't like any of them - but that is just my taste. I'm not fond of this chrome look that is out at the moment and I just hate creams/browns.<br>  <br>  However, I do think they are a bit pricey. The microwave price may be OK (not sure, microwaves are one product I have never bought for myself) but the kettle and toaster - ￡55 each? Way too much, especially since that money could go on other things you will need with a new baby on the way.<br>  <br>  You can still get lovely toasters and kettles for much less in other stores, Tesco, Currys etc. Probably half the price (or less) and can still look just as classy.

Some of the stuff might be okay like coupons for free stuff, otherwise probably a lot of advertising.<br>  <br>  OK|`|JrC2KGOQaa	They seem to feel that prolonging the exposure (saving the symbols, writing out the form & addressing the envelope, receiving mail) gives them more play.

UM2RvgAgaa	When I make dough. I let it rest/raise for 4 to 5 hours. You can put in the fridge if you want. I usually take wet cloth and cover the dough with it.

Long rising time.  Makes a very nice bread.<br>  <br>  Just be careful that the top doesn't dry out.  I'd say cover with a wet towel.  For me, whenever I let bread rise for any more than a couple hours it starts to get dry on top and not very appetizing.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	It can take up to 5 hours for dough to rise.  Depends on the temperature of the area where the dough is rising.  You will be gone long enough so when you get back, they will be perfect.

It is your right not to.<br>  <br>  You can use a tight sealed microwave container like "Rubber Maid" to carry your soup but keep refrigerated until use to avoid bacteria forming.<br>  <br>  If you use a thermos be sure to wash properly and sanitize it before and after use.<br>  <br>  Here is one manufacturer's suggestion for care of a Thermos.|`|eL268hETaa	Campbells and other companies make SOUP TO GO.  Prepackaged leakproof soup servings designed for the microwave.  It's more expensive per ounce to buy it that way, but a lot of people pay extra for convenience.  The containers are recyclable as well, so you don't have to wash them or worry about breaking a thermos or leaving it behind someplace.<br>  <br>  As for microwaved food being bad for you, that's bunk.  The only way microwave ovens can hurt you is by interfering with the operation of a cardiac pacemaker, should you happen to have one...

A5gfxSyzaa	I love BBQ sauce, and use it on bean burgers, wraps, tofu, etc.<br>  <br>  As for chicken flavored products - that depends where the flavor comes from.

It should be quite runny, like the consistancy of custard.  You should only use a bit of oil and run the batter slowly around the pan heating gently until a thin layer covers the pan.  When it's cooked and doesn't stick you can flip it over.  I'm not sure why people are referring to pancakes rising - English pancakes don't (as in the saying flat as a pancake).  Better luck next time.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	I would cut back a little on the milk, by a 1/4 cup and make a pancake to see if it is the consistency you want.

Instead of splitting your budgeted amount on decorations, DJ's etc, put it into a simple meal at one of these hotels, which are really special and will be remembered.<br>  <br>  Everyone can get all dressed up and especially at the Taj, the entrance is so romantic. Inside, it is enchanting as well. <br>  <br>  Tell them what your budget is when you phone and ask them to suggest a menu. Keep the menu short and simple.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

hcJcC182aa	It appears that it can be helpful for at least an introduction to wine. I suggest you find out if it is offered on line or in England. If you do go the WSET route it is a good idea to seek out industry work now to give yourself the practical experience you need to succeed in the wine industry. You may also choose to attend community college until you qualify for acceptance to a university. It is easier to qualify for the California State University system than the University of California System. But also know that the UCD program is well known for their wine education.

8qZrlz07aa	No- Just cut from where is works best for you.  The only thing you would need to take as advice is just cut what you are going to eat in that bite.  <br>  <br>  This is for a couple reasons.  First, it is going to keep the steak warmer by reducing surface area exposed to air.   Second, it  will keep the juices in the steak and thus preserve the flavor.  Third, that is the polite thing to do.<br>  <br>  Of course, all this goes out the window if you are doing it for a child who can't cut for themselves.  They don't know much about flavor and perfect temperature really doesn't matter for them.|`|sDKCX43caa	Cut which ever way you like, it makes no difference.<br>  Turn the steak over and you are cutting from the other.|`|gFzmBjqPaa	Cut across the grain, this will make chewing easier and the meat is more tender this way.

These would require refrigeration but a tray of them will look really nice along with the cupcakes.<br>  <br>  A third tray can hold slices of mini loaves of date and nut bread or banana bread. This is a good one because you can bake in advance and freeze. Defrost on the day, slice and spread neatly with cream cheese. If you don't have mini loaf pans, use a regular size pan and cut each slice in half.<br>  <br>  And on a pretty serving plate, arrange three of your cupcake. Put a birthday candle in each one so can light the candles and sing happy birthday to your Dad, lucky indeed to have you.|`|WVP1v18Raa	That would be good.

gb4VzNXQaa	Figure out which foods you overeat the most of and don't purchase them anymore, at least until you get this under control.  When you cook make sure you cook only enough for one proper serving of each food so there are no second helpings.  If you have time, it also helps to cook most foods from scratch so that it's harder to just pick something up and eat it.  I pretty much only keep staples in the house like flour, dry pasta, cans of sauce with no spices added, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you're overeating for emotional reasons it can also help to figure out what those reasons are and find other ways to deal with them.

f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Too late!<br>  <br>  The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71.<br>  Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community. <br>  Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, The California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours.<br>  Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described him as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.<br>  He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times and a crusty old man he was still considered a positive roll model for millions.<br>  He is survived by his wife Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. <br>  The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	lol.... the doughboy?!?!

YAPEpa5baa	There's absolutely no reason why vegans or vegetarians cannot eat onions and garlic.  It's probably just an individual's personal preference or choice.  Frankly, even when I was vegetarian, I could not manage to not use either at least once a day, or more often.  If I'm not using it in fresh form, I'm using the powdered or dehydrated versions.<br>  <br>  I have no clue why anyone would say something so ridiculous other than they didn't want onion and garlic breath.  In my life, there is no such thing as too much garlic.  For that matter, garlic is a natural antibiotic and good for your health.  I used to take garlic pills in capsule form as a holistic antibiotic when I popped tons of vitamins years ago.

DT2mU1jOaa	There does exist some variance to the fermentable sugars produced in thinner mashes and the (fermentable) monosaccharides in any mashing system. In general the thinner mashes do favor sugar (saccarfication) but a mash that is not too thin gives more total fermentables. So consider thin vs thick vs moderately thick-thin as there variables of a mash. The thick-thin mash produces more fermentables overall than the thinner sugars produced in a thin mash system.<br>  <br>  Shoot for a ratio of 3.9K g/10L|`|m1cEbzBcaa	the thinner the mash, the easier it is for the yeast to get at the sugars that it uses to make alcohol.|`|hcJcC182aa	I have always heard that the thinner mashes produce thinner more alcohol containing beer.

3tuwWidiaa	Are you looking to completely cut out egg?  Or just reduce?<br>  <br>  For example, products like real mayo are loaded with egg and might be worthwhile cutting from your diet.  Baked goods sometimes have egg, but sometimes it's not too much (like an egg was to keep the seeds on).<br>  <br>  Then there are the thousands of products which use relatively small amounts of egg as a binder.  For example, most veggie burgers contain egg.  However, it's in a small amount such that you need not worry if you don't eat egg for nutrition reasons.  Those that want to avoid egg due to allergy or moral opposite would want to avoid these products.<br>  <br>  In your situation, it doesn't sound like you have a moral opposition to eggs.  You simply want to reduce your consumption.  Therefore, I'd cut out eggs themselves (obviously), mayo, other egg-based salad dressings, egg-heavy baked goods (cakes, pancakes, challah, some ice creams -- which you'd likely avoid anyway due the dairy.

y8b86tTEaa	I think you're doing absolutely the right thing researching your knives thoroughly. Steel alone doesn't define knife performance, heat treatment, blade geometry are equally as important, but then again, no heat treatment will make crappy steel perform good.<br>  <br>  Also, just the elemental makeup of the steel won't tell you anything, whether it's good or bad. Better to check steel FAQs and knife forums to figure out  what's a good steel.<br>  Kitchen Knife Steel FAQ here - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/misc/articles/kkchoser/kksteel.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/mi...</a><br>  <br>  As for the 1.4226 - It's a German steel, another name, widely used for it is X50CrMoV15. Used in Wusthofs, Henckels and may other German knives.Very stain resistant, but not very high edge holding. As usual gets hardened to 54-56HRC. Below that, maker is doing bad job.<br>  <br>  VG-10 and other high end steel kitchen knives aren't produced in China, at least the best to my knowledge. Very few Western knives are produced with those too. If you need that kind of kitchen knife then Japanese are pretty much the only ones making kitchen knives from really good steels and making very efficient cutters too. Unless you want to make a custom kitchen knife, which can get real expensive.<br>  <br>  I don't really know about knife prices in China, but you can order from the internet no? There are some very good Japanese knives for the  same price as western kitchen knives, they cut a lot better because of their thin edges and harder steel. And they hold sharp edge longer too.<br>  <br>  The best Chinese cleavers (chukabocho) are also produced by Japanese makers. <br>  <br>  Either way, don't go by steel content. Kitchen knives have different requirements from combat knives and content alone is very obscure even for the metallurgist. Best is to figure out better steels and then pick knives if steel is that important. Otherwise, you can go by knife performance itself and pick simply stain resistant or carbon.<br>  <br>  There's bunch of aspects to choosing the right kitchen knife, covered here - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/misc/articles/kkchoser/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/mi...</a>|`|hT7BhNamaa	Confusion Sucks. Why are you going into all this crap over the content of steel in the knives, your only confusing yourself. I recommend you go to a chef's supply or a good store that sells chef's utensil's and knows what he is talking about, and look at something that is comfortable for you.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and have used Chinese chefs knives, different types from cleavers, even french knives, they are mostly carbon steel, and are made with a cold forged process, they are as good as the European knives and are marketability cheaper, I have one a french knife a 8" one with a green non porous handle. I like it, it is light weight and very well made, and keeps an edge quite well, just look for the better type available.
Scupj6XVaa	I have had chicken legs cooked in spaghetti sauce, and they were delicious... im sure wings (my fave) would be delicious.  thanks for the idea!|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Chicken will provide lots of flavor but you really need to get rid of the skin.    Small wingtips will be very tough to remove the skin.     Even though they will provide lots of flavor, they will also throw off a lot of fat.      If you are ok with refrigerating it overnight and skimming the fat then you can get away with it.    When I put chicken in a red sauce, I normally use skinless thighs.|`|53giV6PFaa	Sure you can.  That's the beauty of cooking - it allows you to experiment - sometimes it turns out good and sometimes it turns out bad.  <br>  <br>  This would be how I would try it out to make the wings like a buffalo wing.  Cut the tips off your wings.  You can either brown your wings in a skillet until golden brown or just put them directly in the crockpot.  I like browning them first - gives them a bit more flavor.  Cook on low for about 4-6 hours.  Spaghetti sauce may be too runny of a sauce for the wings.  You can try heating the sauce in a pan first and adding a cornstarch slurry (1 tbsp cornstarch to 2 tbsp of cold water).  The conrstarch will thicken the sauce without altering the flavor.  Add to the sauce and let it thicken, then put the sauce in the crockpot.  This way the sauce will cling to your wings.  When done sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese and enjoy.<br>  <br>  As for chicken spaghetti, I use boneless chicken breast not bone in chicken pieces and made it as a casserole.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Jamie, there is only one answer to your question, "YES", go right ahead, I use wings, bones, backs, necks in my soups and specially for a good pasta sauce, I like flavor in my dishes.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Yes you can. Either add them with the sauce on Low for 8 hours or on High for about 4-5 hours. Remove wings from slow cooker and shred.

Chicken wings will taste okay, but they will be messy because you can't eat them with silverware.  Yes you can use jar sauce in a crockpot, just add more water and cook it on low so the tomato will not scorch.  What I would suggest is you bake or fry the wings first, and then dip them in a bowl of warmed sauce... like party wings.  You could even sprinkle them with grated parmesan afterward.|`|9180cbc0f4cb5886525affd9ed9878a9aa	For chicken spaghetti I use skinless chicken breast (that I cut up) because the skin doesn't get crispy and I hate that texture of crispyless chicken skin. <br>  <br>  If you still would like to use chicken wings, cook them under your broiler in the oven first or saute on top of the stove first then slow cook them. After the sauce is done cooking before the meat from the bone and throw away the bone. This procedure gives your sauce a lot of flavor. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|zqrimtrnaa	Is very good i do it all the time. i'm a Chef i know what i'm talking about.|`|W7KQLdRPaa	yes u can use it

(Recipe in the source!)|`|466d0df8a4110fb75f51028e25c34d52aa	here are some for you  Poke Salad  (USA) Poke is an American vegetable. Poke Salad  Beets on a Burger  (Australia) I'm an Aussie currently residing in Canada and was astounded to find that no-one here puts beets on burgers - any real Aussie burger has pickled beets (beetroot) on it, in addition to a fried egg, plus the rest of your regular fixin's.  Collard Greens  (US South) Collard greens - soul food at its best! Popular in the rural south and pretty much wherever there are black folks with Southern roots. Similar to turnip greens, but much stronger taste and aroma. If prepared correctly, have oodles of bacon fat and "white meat" (pork belly). I personally love them, but don't like to be in the kitchen while they're cooking... smells like the whole family has gas & everyone went to the kitchen to relieve the pressure.  Kim Chee  (Korea) Fermented cabbage. The cabbage is soaked in a tub containing salt and red pepper. It is usually left for several weeks before serving, but can be stored for months in clay pots buried underground. Takes on a hot vinegar taste after fermentation  Petai beans  (Malaysia) Petai beans smell like methane gas. Petai.html  Kava  (Fiji) Passed around in a large "salad bowl" for all to share, this drink has a slight numbing effect, if you can get past the taste of wet cement. It is crushed kava root and water, strained which gives it a white, slightly milky appearance. Some say it is a drug, but you would have to drink so much of it to feel an effect past your tongue tingling, that you are probably better off just having a beer. (I couldn't help but think that maybe some Kool-Aid may spruce it up).  Poi  (Hawaii) Mashed taro root. Taro (Hawaiians call it kalo) is poisonous in its raw form due to calcium oxalate crystals, so the Polynesians smashed taro into paste. Hawaiians love strong tastes, so the bland, starchy poi is often eaten as part of a full meal to balance and cleanse the palate between dishes. Hawaiians sometimes encourage mainlanders and kids to put sugar and water into it to make it more palatable. Fresh poi should be relatively tasteless, packaged and old poi tends to be slightly tangy. (I've tried this. Like unflavored glue. - andreas)  Three-fried Beans  (US South) You talked a few times about the South loving fried food but I think the pinnacle of this obsession is something I had while driving through Arkansas. This restaurant sold what it called Three-fried Beans. This was ball of refried beans, battered, and then fried again. Just think about it. First you have the refried beans, I don't know if they made or bought pre-made, which is beans fried and then refried. Next you batter them and then fry them again? The batter was kind of sweet and it was actually pretty good.  Dried bananas  (Brazil) They're black, wrinkled, dry and sweet, about the size of nana's feeble finger. No refrigeration necessary. Mmmmm!  Fried Green Tomatoes  (US South) Fried Green Tomatoes (just like the movie!). How can anyone think of something like that, eat an unripe fruit? Yet I have to admit that it wasn't bad at all! (We also ate this in Tennessee. Slice up a green tomato, dust it with corn meal, and fry in butter. - andreas)  Cactus Apples  (US Southwest, Mexico) A red or purple fruit found growing on beavertail cactus plants. Remove CAREFULLY, roll it around in the sand then skin it with a sharp knife (try not to get stuck by the needles) and slice into disk-shaped sections for eating as a finger food. The purple ones taste like cranberry and the red ones taste like pear. Notes: The juice leaves bright stains. You may want to spit the seeds out. Family gatherings in the outdoors often turn into cactus apple hunts. Kids are always encouraged to help hunt and then eat some. Do not eat more than three at a time. You will get constipated.  Jackfruit  (Vietnam)  I ate jackfruit in Jacksonville, Florida. I bought it in an Asian market and then took it into a Vietnamese restaurant, where they recognized it and everybody smiled and nodded, so I guess it's a Vietnamese fruit. In many ways it's similar to durian, with the weird lobey yellow items inside a frightening, huge, spiney pod, but it's a different pod, bright green instead of brown like durian, and the spines are not as lethal seeming. I guess they're more like nubs, or nubbins, than spines. And the texture of the part you eat is very different from durian. Not as soft. More juicy than custardy. More structural integrity. Sleek and shiny rather than flabby and noisome (but I mean flabby and noisome in the best way: I like durian a LOT). The most interesting thing about jackfruit is that the lobey yellow things are in a latex matrix, and if you try to just reach in and grab them, the latex gets all over your fingers and you can't believe how sticky it is. The Vietnamese restauranteurs, when they saw us trying to eat our jackfruit, laughed and then disapeared into the kitchen and came running out with a little dish of vegetable oil. Y
AA12336927	I would poach the chicken, if I'm correct, that you want to add it to soup thats already prepared ( ex. progresso)  How to Make Poached Chicken Breasts  The keys to poaching are: the size of the pan, the volume of liquid and the cooking temperature.        * Place chicken breasts in a pot that's just about large enough to fit them in one layer. Two medium chicken breasts fit snugly in my 2 quart round oven.      * Add poaching liquid so that it completely covers the chicken by at least a half inch to an inch.      * After bringing the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to a bare simmer so that only an occasional bubble breaks the surface. At this point, partly cover the pot, cook for about 10 minutes, then turn off the heat, leaving the chicken to finish cooking in the hot water for 10-15 more minutes.      * Remove chicken, then enjoy it warm or refrigerate it for later use. Slice or shred your poached chicken depending on what you want to use it for.    Here is an excellent southwestern style chicken and black bean soup. It will sure beat the hell out of canned soup   Southwest Chicken and Black Bean Soup  adapted from Fine Cooking Magazine and the Oregonian    2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  3 thick slices bacon  3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 large yellow onion, diced  1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and finely diced  2 teaspoons chili powder  1 teaspoon ground cumin  3/4 cup beer  1 can (15-1/2 ounces) black beans, rinsed (about 2 cups)  1 dried chipotle (optional)  2 cups homemade or low-salt canned chicken broth; more if needed  3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves  1 lime  Sour cream for garnish  baked tortilla strips (optional)    Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until it renders much of its fat and crisps slightly, about 7 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Season the chicken well with salt and pepper. Dice the chicken and cook in the pan until cooked through, about 7-10 minutes. Remove chicken.    There should be 2 to 3 tablespoons fat left in the pan; if theres more, spoon out and discard the excess. Add the onion and bell pepper, season well with salt, and cook, stirring often, until the onion softens and caramelizes slightly, about 7 minutes. Raise the heat to high, add the chili powder and cumin, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the beer and cook until its almost completely reduced, about 3 minutes. Add the beans, the chipotle (if using), and the chicken broth. When the mixture comes to a boil, adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.    Return the chicken to the pot, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and simmer for 5 minutes. If the stew is too thick, thin it with more chicken broth. Discard the chipotle. Crumble the reserved bacon. Juice one half of the lime; cut the other half into wedges. Stir the bacon, lime juice, and 2 tablespoons of the cilantro into the stew and season well with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, ladling some of the beans and chicken into each bowl. Sprinkle each serving with the remaining cilantro and a small dollop of sour cream. Serve with the lime wedges and baked tortilla strips, if you like.    Baked tortilla strips are just as satisfying as their greasy cousins. Simply cut a corn or flour tortilla into strips and bake at 400 degrees until toasted.      edit: thats okay Bluerose, I misunderstood. Still, poach the chicken, it will be moist and tender, you can add a bay leaf to the poaching liquid as well. I prefer my soups to be a one pot meal too. I sometimes add some butter french bread or salad|`|KkZE2NDYaa	over-cooking chicken breast meat will make it tough. Try adding it toward the end and simmer, don't boil it.|`|CvYq5wBhaa	Poaching will keep the chicken unbelievably tender. Either put the chicken, cut into 1-inch chunks, in the soup that you're making, bring it to a boil, then allow to simmer until the chicken is cooked through OR do the same thing using broth in a separate pot.|`|iOYCCaoYaa	Well, what I usually do is in a skillet, I heat oil. Once it's nice and hot, I through onions and garlic in. You want the pan to sizzle loud! (But be careful not to burn them! Not a good taste!) I put the heat on 6. Then I squirt lemon juice on it before i flip it. Brown it as much as you want. Flip it over and brown that side. Then turn it all the way down to 2 or 3... and cover. That allows it to cook on the inside without it burning on the outside. Oops! I left out that i season it with salt and pepper before I put it in the skillet. Anyway, I take it out, let it cool and I cut them in chunks. Put them in at the last second so you won't overcook them.

I think I would be disappointed if all meat, chicken and fish was unavailable, but that isn't likely as our economy relies on Lamb and Seafood exports.   I think they would still be available, but as we have seen over the years, when export prices go up, so does the price for national consumption.  Some cuts and types of meats have priced themselves off the table for the poor already and in time it will affect those on the different incomes.

36a3ynpJaa	I was on food stamps for a month or so and it was plenty.  However, I also know how to shop and how to cook. This guy is trying to prove that it is impossible and isn't trying very hard.    Some of the things I got:    Chicken thighs in bulk  Buttermilk and bread crumbs to make oven fried chicken.  Carrots, Celery and Onions for Soups  Fixings for Quiche:  Premade pie crusts, eggs, bacon, frozen spinach, mushrooms,onions, Swiss cheese.  Bulk Sausage  Green chiles  Cheddar Cheese  Dry Split peas and Kielbasa for soup.  Liverwurst and saltine crackers  Frozen burritos  Raisin Bran  Old Fashioned Oatmeal  Milk  Flour Tortillas  Salsa  Refried Beans  Frozen OJ  Potatoes for scalloped potatoes with Kielbasa  Spaghetti and sauce  Generic Mac and Cheese  Ground Beef for sauce  Jimmy Dean Breakfast skillets  Coffee  Sugar  Frozen mixed Veg  Medium grain rice  Canned Caneli beans, Chicken Stock, Collard Greens  Butter  PB & J, bread    Typical Diet  Breakfast options  Raisin Bran, Oatmeal, Quiche, Breakfast Burritos, Jimmy dean skillets with eggs(about 1$ per serve, weekends)  Toast w/ butter  OJ   Coffee    Lunch  Usually at work so Frozen Burrito or left over dinner from night before taken to work  or homemade soup with crackers  Sometimes breakfast burritos made with sausage, chiles, cheese and eggs.  PB and J sandwiches for snacks also Liverwurst and Crackers    Dinner  Burritos, Scalloped potatoes with Kielbasa, Pasta w/ meat, Quiche, Homemade Soup, Oven fried chicken, veg over rice.      Items like Potatoes, Raisin Bran, and Oats are good staple foods along with the pasta.    I also shopped sometimes late to get in store baked goods that were marked down.  I could get donuts and some other stuff like that half price.  One of the tricks is to be able to make enough of something to last four ot more meals.  The quiche I made two at a time and that was about eight servings.|`|AA11537580	most likely it is to prove you can  not live on food stamps|`|LxUX3TdLaa	Yeah that kind of pisses me off, sad to say!    I don't get food stamps and I stay having to eat ramen noodles...     while people WITH food stamps eat up the fancy stuff!     Either way - they did a special on the news where I am it was all "how to eat on 10 dollars a week"    the man bought a few packs of ramen noodles, a large bag of beans, a large bag of rice, some bullion cubes and a thing of eggs.     Free money doesn't = savvy shoppers, they spend it how they want to because it's FREE to them... however I help them eat fancy zattarans while I'm eating my hard beans and ramen noodles...    nice.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	If people only learned to cook they could save SO much money.    Some tips to living on a small food budget are:    NEVER buy pre-packaged, conveience meals or single serve portion sizes.  It's almost always cheaper to buy the ingredients in bulk and put them together yourself then portion them out to freeze, refrigerate, or store.    Avoid canned foods like pastas, soups, etc.  Pasta is cheap in bulk and you can do so much.  Soup is a very cheap meal if  you make it from leftovers.    Buy dry beans/peas/rices in bulk as opposed to single serve, prepared or canned.    Buy fresh fruits and veggies in season when they're cheaper and fresher.    ONLY buy meats on when they're on sale or go fishing/hunting to secure you're own.    Buy the store brand when you can.    Learn to cook!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	If you're on food stamps, then you should sell your computer and stop paying monthly fees for cable or internet connections|`|FqRaTTPpaa	Totally with you.  I don't consider myself poor (although I am a college student) but I eat more frugally than most people who are one food stamps and other forms of welfare.  I can't stand seeing them in the line in front of me buying boxes of Tropicana and name-brand Lucky Charms, while I stick with the cheaper, healthier food.  And then they start complaining that you can't eat healthily on a budget.  That somehow fresh vegetables (or even canned) are too expensive, but TV dinners are still affordable.      I just don't get these people.  I know that there are some that really do do their best to stretch their money as far as possible, but there are so many that just don't seem to have a clue.    Pointers - that's easy.  Don't buy ANYTHING prepackaged that just has to be stuck in the microwave.  Buy the largest available packages of rice, potatoes, pasta, beans, vegetables... sure, meat is expensive, but beans go a long way toward getting protein.  And buying bone-in chicken in the family packs can be really cheap.  Milk, cheese, and fruit will probably be the most expensive purchases, but you should have saved enough elsewhere to still be able to afford milk.|`|P9HuD4Qgaa	You actually can live on food stamps. They average person need to spend about at least 300-400 a month if they have kids, and about 75-150 alone. That's the average amount a person will get for food stamps. unless ur a greedy ****, who needs 1000 worth of food every month. And you can buy whatever, just make sure you do it wisely, catch sales, buy canned goods, frozen meats, other great items. Ur also welcomed to Tropicana, or whatever you choose, just make sure you do it wisely, and get enough.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	I sure wish I had room for a deep freezer. The money I could save! Depends on how many you shop for. For me, it's two. See if a friend will go in on large family packs of meat when a special is on. Buy more than 1 Sunday paper. That means more coupons. This is usually worth the price of the paper many times over. Personally the little store cooked chickens are worth the price. I can't really make them cheaper. I use that for 1 meal. Then use leftover meat for an add in to noodles, salad whatever. I freeze the bones and then make soup. I get my $ 4.99 worth.
287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Try Pesto it is amazing:    2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese   1/2 cup Olive oil   3 tablespoons pine nuts or walnuts   3 garlic cloves, finely minced     1.  Place basil leaves in small batches in food processor and whip until well chopped (do about 3/4 cup at a time). Add about 1/3 the nuts and garlic, blend again.    2.  Add about 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese; blend while slowly adding about 1/3 of the olive oil, stopping to scrape down sides of container.    3.  Process basil pesto it forms a thick smooth paste. Repeat until all ingredients are used, mix all batches together well.     4.  Serve over pasta. Basil pesto keeps in refrigerator one week, or freeze for a few months.|`|uap6JAqQaa	my personal favorite is alfredo sauce mixed with tomato sauce...sort of a makeshift tomato cream sauce...it's so good, especially on ravioli! i also love garlic butter sauce on angel hair, with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. and like someone else said, pesto is really really good!

hHCdXq0Naa	Of course not.  But, why not just buy skinless pieces of chicken?   It's very common to use a rack to roast chicken or meat on|`|thoMmZAvaa	It's not a strange way to cook chicken, in terms of cooking it on a rack. I'd suggest maybe leaving the skin and fat on while cooking it, then removing it afterwards. It'll produce moister chicken with more flavor (the flavor is in the fat unfortunately) by allowing it to self baste. If removing as much fat as possible is your goal, baking really isn't the best way to cook chicken in this manner, it makes it very tough and dry. Poaching is a wonderful method of cooking without added fat, just poach the meat in water or (chicken/veggie) broths (which will add great flavors).|`|AA12395636	Who cares if it's odd?  If that's the way you like, then make it that way.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	No not odd at all, very healthy way to cook chicken, good for you.|`|466d0df8a4110fb75f51028e25c34d52aa	no it is not odd   but you sure get a dried out old tough piece of chicken that way|`|ARmhMq5laa	no,it's healthy:)|`|P9HuD4Qgaa	No, not at all|`|GCBv0zkoaa	No, but to keep the chicken moist, put 1/2 to 1 cup of boiling water in the pan beneath the rack.  It will catch any fat and add moisture to the chicken as it cooks.|`|Vp4DcPX2aa	if you like dry chicken. or if you are on a DIET i can see that working. but the juices from the chicken are what make the chicken taste good and be tender.|`|INPrlW6Maa	That's not odd at all.

Here are some things you might want to know about the cuisine as a non-Indian. Most restaurants make vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes equally well. Indian vegetarian food is very different (in all aspects - taste, texture, flavor) from what westerners perceive vegetarian. Most dishes are had with flat breads such as naan, roti, or kulcha and sometimes rice. One of the most popular ingredients is paneer - an Indian cheese, it is extremely popular and is used in all kinds of dishes. Most starters are deep fried or pan-fried. Ask the waiters to explain what kind of ingredients are used in the dish and if they can vary the spiciness of the dish - if you are experimental ask them to make it spicy.<br>  <br>  Some names to familiarize yourself to the menu - <br>  Samosas<br>  Bajjis<br>  tikka (like a kabab)<br>  paneer (Indian cheese)<br>  Daal - curry with lentils<br>  palak / saag - spinach / mustard leaves<br>  channa - chick peas<br>  murg - chicken<br>  gosh - mutton<br>  breads - naan, roti, kulcha, paratha, chapati<br>  sweets - gulab jamoon, kheer, gajar halwa.<br>  <br>  Just go and experiment, I am sure you'll love it!|`|yz6G7jfXaa	indian food is just a term.<br>  every state here has it's own food and the difference n the food and tastes of people is staggering.<br>  <br>  try "tandoori" or "biryani"<br>  there's much ,much more.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	If you oder hot food have plenty of water or cucumber or yogurt around.

Their cuisines are as different as that of UK and Italy. Also, among north indian, if you are going to Rajastani restaurent or Punjabi, things will be very different.<br>   In fact, variety in Indian food can only be matched by all European cuisines pooled together, as each Indian state is culturally and historically a country in itself. Each has its cuisine. India has 27 states.. it thus has more than 27 cuisines.<br>  If you are going to a north-indian restaurent, try butter chicken or daal-maakhni. If u going to a south-indian one, try Masala dosa.
AA12395636	First you'd need a rotisserie, and they are pretty expensive. There is nothing easier than roasted chicken.  I just cover mine with lemon pepper, and put in a preheated oven (350) for 20 mins. per pound.  The big secret is to brine chicken first.  You put it in a bag with cold salted water for 8 hours, or overnight before cooking.  It will be tender and juicy if you don't over cook it.  Buy yourself a meat thermometer instead of a rotisserie|`|ur3vgbXoaa	First of all do not make such a scary dreadful experience out of it.  Simply wash off the chicken, put it on the rotisserie and let it baste in it's own juices while it cooks.  It will be NO trouble, and it is delicious.    If you want other recipes for chicken...just boil one of them and when two hours is up remove it from the water (which is now broth) and you can put some canned biscuits in the boiling broth and have dumplings!  Or just drop egg noodles or linguini or any noodles in the broth and have soup.

If you have one that will fit the whole bird, place it in (you could also cut it up to fit), add some chopped carrots, celery, onion, or whatever else you wish, season with salt, pepper, and whatever dried or fresh herbs you like, add water or stock (just some, not to cover), and cook for 12 hours.  You will need to check on the water level every once in a while, as it will evaporate.

I broil my chicken wings and baste the sauce on during the final few minutes of cooking - this works and keeps the sauce on.|`|53giV6PFaa	I made this weekend and it was great.  I used a 4lb bag of chicken wings.      I marinaded them in the morning then baked them in the afternoon before the big game.      Here is what I used for the marinade:    1 c. cider vinegar  2 tbsp. vegetable oil  2 tbsp. worcestershire sauce  2 tbsp. chili powder  1 tsp. red pepper flakes  1 tsp. salt  1 tsp. freshly ground pepper  1 tbsp. Tabasco (hot red pepper) sauce    To make the marinade, in a small bowl stir together the vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce. Place the chicken wings in a large plastic food storage bag and pour in the marinade. Press out the air and seal the bag tightly. Massage the bag gently, to distribute the marinade. Set in a large bowl and refrigerate for several hours, turning and squeezing the bag occasionally.    I made a little extra marinade (about a cup's worth) for basting adding extra tobassco sauce and cut down a bit on the vinegar.  I baked them in a preheated 375 degree oven on shallow baking trays covered with foil for easy clean up.  Be sure to spray the foil so they don't stick.  I baked them for an hour.  I basted them about 10 minutes for the last half of the cooking.  They were awesome.|`|2Lnpjaumaa	cook the wings in a crockpot with butter and Franks red hot sauce|`|rz91gokWaa	after you fry the wings heat your buffalo sauce in a pan with butter and toss the wings.

The sauce also gets thicker and stickier as it cools.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	That would be a good idea.  I never fry mine though and don't seem to have that problem.

INPrlW6Maa	Lavash (Soft) Pita Bread Ingredients  1/2 c Butter -- softened  4 c Bread or all-purpose flour    3 tb Parsley -- finely chopped  1 pk Dry yeast    1 ts Lemon rind -- finely grated  2 ts Salt    1 tb Lemon juice  1 tb Olive or vegetable oil; plus    1 pn White pepper  1 1/2 c Hot water; (120~-130~)        Instructions for Lavash (Soft) Pita Bread  Equipment: 1 wok, scoured clean on the outside; an inverted bowl (with gently sloping sides) covered with a cloth over which to rest the bread before it is baked. By Hand or Mixer 15 minutes: Combine two cups flour, yeast and salt. Mix a tablespoon oil with the hot water and pout into the flour . Stir with a wooden spoon or a mixer flat beater to mix well. Add additional flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a shaggy mass of dough. Kneading 5-8 minutes: Turn from the bowl onto the work counter and knead with a firm push-turn-fold motion until the dough is soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. If under a dough hook, knead for 5 minutes. By Processor 5 minutes: Attach the steel blade. The order of ingredients varies from above. Pour hot water and oil into the work bowl and add the yeast and salt. Pulse on/off to mix. Remove the cover and add 2 cups flour. Process 10 seconds. Add the balance of flour, 1/4 cup at a time, processing each time to blend. Kneading 50 seconds: When the dough forms into a ball and rides on the blade, knead for 50 seconds. Rising 40 minutes: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and put in a warm place (80~-100~) until doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes. (If prepared with a new fast-rising yeast at the recommended higher temperatures, reduce the rising time by about half.) Shaping 20 minutes: Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and divide into 6 or 8 pieces. First under your palm and then with a rolling pin, shape each ball of dough into a 10" circle. Place the flattened dough on the back of your hands and carefully stretch the diameter to 15" or 16". (The back of the hands are used rather than the fingers, which can tear the dough.) After shaping the dough, dust each with flour and drape them together over the cloth-covered bowl (inverted) to rest for 10 minutes. Preheat the inverted wok over a medium-high flame while the dough is resting. The wok is hot enough for the dough when a drop of water sizzles and bounces off the metal. Lightly brush oil over the surface. Baking 18-32 minutes: Place the dough circles, one at a time, on the hot wok. Bake until the dough is browned underneath, about 3 or 4 minutes. Dont bake until it is crisp (then it becomes a cracker bread!) Turn the dough over and brown the other side. The bread should be soft and floppy. Reduce baking time or lower the heat if the bread is hard. Lift the bread off the wok and fold into quarters while still hot. Place in a plastic bag to keep soft. Continue baking the balance of the breads. Final step: The breads may be served warm. After they have cooled, refrigerate or freeze. This is a marvelous bread to take on a picnic and wrap around meats and other delicacies.|`|zQbpJmESaa	Lavash Bread (Spiced)  Lavash Bread (Spiced) Ingredients  1/2 tsp Dill  1/8 cup Olive Oil    1/2 tsp Caraway Seeds  1/8 cup Water    1/2 tsp Fennel  1 Salt (for sprinkling over)    1/3 cup Flour    http://www.bigoven.com/169369-Lavash-Bre...

The base liquid is typically milk, water, or a combination thereof, though you could certainly give soymilk, almond milk, or the like a try as well.  The liquid should be heated gently, then add the chocolate base of your choice - it could be chocolate bars (milk or dark), cocoa powder, or a combination of the two.  How much depends on how "chocolatey" you want the end product to taste.  Experiment a bit.  You should stir while heating so the chocolate is well incorporated.  Next you could add a sweetener of some kind, whether white sugar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, or whatever you fancy.  For a truly bracing, but bitter, drink, you could omit the sweetener altogether.    Some other options include the following: add cinnamon or other spices, add some half and half or whipping cream for a richer drink, or even add liquor of some kind, preferably distilled spirits like brandy, whiskey, or rum.    Marshmallows should top off the drink - if you add them early they will melt into the beverage (although that might be tasty, too!)|`|HoU7Vjngaa	put the small ones on top or if there big chop them up|`|xLj4nilXaa	You just put the marshmallow in the cup!|`|cn7gqmbaaa	melt the chocolate in a pad    roll the marshmellows in it      simple

u23sua9daa	Make miso  Not many people make miso at home because its a very lengthy process and requires some experience. Nevertheless we will try to explain how to make miso at home.       Ingredients for home made miso  To make miso you need the following ingredients:   400 g whole soybeans   600 ml water   150 g salt   300 g dried rice koji (rice fermented with special moulds, this can be bought are also made at home)   Miso production process  All utensils which you use for the production of miso should be clean and preferably be rinsed with boiling water. These are the steps to make miso at home:      Soaking the soybeans - Soak the soybeans during 3 hours in the water. By that time the soybeans should have doubled in size.      Cooking the soybeans - Put the soaked beans with the soaking water in a pressure cooker and cook at max pressure during 40 minutes. The soybeans should be soft. Open the pressure cooker and drain the beans in a colander, making sure to recover the soaking water.If you don't have a pressure cooker you will need to boil for about 3 to 4 hours to obtain soft soybeans.      Mixing the soybeans - When the beans are still hot, use a potato masher to puree the beans until about one third of the soybeans is still whole. Allow he beans to cool down to 35-40C. If temperature is too high the koji culture could become inactive.      Making miso paste - Take 200 ml of the soaking water (add more water if you dont have enough of it) and dissolve the salt (except for 2 teaspoon salt which you need in the following step). Add this liquid slowly to the soybeans while mixing stirring continuously. Crumble the koji into the miso mixture and with your clean hands mix until you obtain a smooth mixture.      Preparation of miso container - As a fermentation vat use a glazed ceramic cylindrical container of about 5 kg. Make sure that the ceramic container is suitable for food preparations. Rub the inside of the container with 1 teaspoon of salt and add the miso mixture. Level the miso surface and sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt, this to prevent unwanted moulds and bacteria from spoiling the surface which is in contact with the air. Cover the miso with a round piece of kitchen paper and press it firmly on the miso. Top with a round wooden lid that just fits in the container and some weights (about 3 kg, well washed stones). Cover the container with wrapping paper and tie in place with a string or rubber. Repeat all steps as before to make more batches in the following days and add them to the container (first removing lid and rubbing the inside of the container with about 1 teaspoon salt) until the container is about 80% full.      Miso fermentation - The fermentation will start immediately. The container should be place in a clean room with moderate temperatures (15C  25C). The miso will be ready after 6 to 12 months fermentation. During the fermentation some liquid (=tamari) will rice to the surface. If no liquid tamari is seen on the surface then the pressing weight must be increased.  Each time you want to inspect the fermentation process you will loose quality, so dont do it when not necessary and not more frequently then once every 2 months. This miso can be kept in the container for a few years.       Traditional Japanese miso production  In Japan miso was traditionally produced in small miso shops. Each miso shop used its own unique process and has its own secrets. Before one can make miso he needs to be educated by a miso master during several years. Typical for these miso shops is that the soybeans are cooked in containers on open fires, that miso is fermented in wooden vats and that no motorized equipment is used. These days theres a lot of competition from big modern miso factories. Due to optimized fermentation conditions the miso is ready after months instead of years. In Japan most miso produced will end up as miso soup.|`|l1BNyWjcaa	I would not recomend you making it it takes a long time|`|7iPKgy5Caa	check out this website.|`|ht3LfDUCaa	ingredients:    * 1?4 oz (7 g) dried seaweed (wakame)      * 4 1?4 oz (120 g) fresh soft tofu or long life silken tofu      * 13 1?2 fl oz (400 ml) dashi (fish and seaweed stock) OR 400 ml (13 1?2 fl oz) of water and 1?2 tsp (2.5 ml) powdered dashi      * 1 1?2 Tbsp (20 ml) miso paste      * 2 medium spring onions  instructions:   1. Heat the dashi. Pour the dashi into a large saucepan or pot, place it on the stove, and turn the heat onto "high".     2.        Soak the wakame. Place the seaweed into a small bowl and add water into the bowl, until it covers it well. By doing this, you're expanding the seaweed.     3.        Melt the miso by putting it into a cup, and pour a little bit of dashi on it to melt it down. Stir throughly until the miso is dissolved. Pour the mixture into the pan and stir.     4. Cut the tofu into into 1 cm squares. You may cut it however you like, bigger or smaller, than 1 cm (depending on your style or likings). Add the tofu pieces to the pan and turn the heat down.     5. Add the wakame to the pan. You do not want this to boil, as the flavors of the dish may impair or distort.     6. Serve the miso soup in bowls. Chop up the spring onions and garnish each bowl before serving.|`|SOPVLyjoaa	The key is to get dashi stock powder, though some miso pastes (like Marukome) come with dashi already in the paste.  Play around with the mix until you get a flavor you like.  I find that a 4g packet of dashi powder goes well with the 800 ml (3 1/3 cup) water and 4 tbsp of miso paste.

I also dice up a small onion and toss it in...sometimes I add a green pepper too if I have one.  Cook in a crock until nice hot.  Also, you will have to add some water to it to get the right consistency....use water though....it helps the chili powder mix in.

rSH5lk02aa	Yes:), its non alcoholic      Red Bull is a utility drink to be taken against mental or physical weariness or exhaustion. Red Bull combines two natural substances and important metabolic transmitters - the amino acid taurine and the glucuronolactone - with stimulating caffeine, vitamins and the energy provided by carbohydrates.    But all of those chemicals[glucuronolactone,amino acid,taurine ]and ingredients are going to make you crash later & feel more horrible then before .If i were you i would try a five hour energy it has a funny taste but it works really well!!:)  but if you have a caffeine defiency or do not do well w/caffeine or cant drink it then you dont need a red bull or 5 hour energy.Just go to bed early get a good night sleep and have a healthy breakfast like cheerios w/bananas or strawberries. A fruit smoothie w/ yogurt in it & a granola bar/oatmeal.Or just some fruit,granola bar,and some yogurt:)    Hope this helped:)|`|kL5f4Pn9aa	Nope, no alcohol. It's fine, just don't take alot too fast. And It's kinda bad to take more then 4 a night. It doesn't have much caffeine. It taste like 7-up or sprite kind of. It's not a hardcore energy drink, there are much much much stronger energy drink's. But red bull Is probably one of the most popular ones. It gives moderate energy and taste pretty good. There Is a crash like most energy drinks.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	Well, when I tasted it, I thought I had a pretty good idea which part of the Bull it came from....yuck!|`|5f8f97b596d7b2be44810ceadae63a38aa	Its an energy drink with no alcohol, tastes like a very sweet medicine. Its pumped full of caffeine and is banned in many countries for that reason.  It causes behavioral problems and can also cause strokes etc. Best to stear clear of it.....
8Wqbz6FMaa	Calderetang kambing is a spicy stew made from the combination of meat and bones of the goat.  It is simmered in garlic, onions and tomatoes, seasoned with bay leaf, paprika, red sweet peppers, black peppers, lots of chopped hot peppers, liver spread, coconut milk and cheese.  Normally, the head of the goat is also tossed in so as not to waste it and for added flavor.  Not an everyday dish in Filipino homes (although available in specialty restaurants), this is prepared for special occasions when friends and families gather.  I find this dish surprisingly good.  Normally, goat meat is tough and smells gamey but this dish is rich and very tasty, tender, very spicy but good.|`|ylJoUuMDaa	Here you are; enjoy    calderetang kambing, stewed goat meat in tomato sauce enhanced with liver, chili, cheese and pickled relish.

8Wqbz6FMaa	Nope, never.  The stink permeates the whole house, all the walls and furniture, curtains, clothes and people.  Even when you fry with all the windows and doors open, the stink still lingers.  And although I love the smell, others don't.  I think it is just common courtesy to make my house clean and smells fresh when I expect visitors, local or foreign.  I want them to feel at ease and comfortable.  I have an outdoor kitchen where I do all of my fish frying  and barbecue.

Bring a pot of liberally salted water to a boil, add pasta and cook until almost al dente then strain, the pasta should be slightly undercooked.  2.   Preheat oven to 375F. Transfer pasta to a 3 to 4 quart baking dish. Add 2 cups of marinara sauce, 4 ounces of mozzarella, and 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (if using the optional ricotta cheese add it all at this point also), and toss until well combined.  3.

Timing is very important.  Put a few drops of olive oil in the cooking water.  This will prevent the pasta from sticking together.    Sauce: Use any sauce that comes in a jar and add some ground beef to it.  Prepare the beef this way.  Heat some oil in a skillet.  Add the chopped beef little by little and cook it over a medium flame until there is not one trace of pink in the meat.  Drain the oil away and add the cooked meat to the sauce.  Cook the whole thing over medium heat for about 20 minutes or so.  You can serve the sauce over the pasta or mix it in; but have some on the side in case people want a little more.  Have some grated parmesan cheese for people to add that as they wish.    Make a simple salad using romain lettuce, ripe tomatoes, black olives.  For a salad dressing you can use any one of a number of bottled dressings.  I like Newman's Own brand in just about every "flavor".    Buon appetito!|`|quTKsQPhaa	Just like spaghetti type pasta? Or are you open to some different ideas too? I love love love to make stuffed shells. I make them very basic though, because it's super fast.

It takes about 45 minutes all together! :)|`|WngxQDiaaa	I love pesto.  I usually add chicken or shrimp to it.  You can buy pesto already made or make it yourself.

(If you are using walnuts instead of pine nuts and they are not already chopped, pulse them a few times first, before adding the basil.) Add the garlic, pulse a few times more.     2 Slowly add the olive oil in a constant stream while the food processor is on. Stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula. Add the grated cheese and pulse again until blended.

Works for me!|`|wPM6eBkWaa	I would go with the cool whip, very good with frosting.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	i think you can just fluff it up w/ some cream, milk, cool whip or even egg whites.|`|PwmgKx2eaa	you could add some cool whip to make it more fluffy. you could also add a little milk to thin it out.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Stick your can of frosting in the micro for one minute or less and then beat it with a mixer till it fluffs up...and it will go a lot further too.    A good recipe (and lots cheaper) is to use powdered sugar, dash of salt, soft butter, milk (a tiny bit - like add a teaspoon at a time to make sure it doesn't ALL turn to liquid!)  Beat it with a mixer and add vanilla while you do that.  Excellent frosting....add cocoa powder  (disolve it with your butter) if you want dark chocolate.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Take one egg white and whip it until it's light and fluffy.  'Fold' that into the frosting.  Fast, easy, doesn't change the taste of the frosting.  Realy decorates on the cake much easier.  Good Luck.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	I use pudding|`|hHCdXq0Naa	If you take the frosting out of the can and beat it, it will fluff up a little.

Po4Lljjwaa	When you drop by a caf in Spain before dinner, you find yourself in the midst of garrulous Spaniards relishing tapas -- a variety of small savory treats, served hot or cold. Tapas are the perfect introduction to the joy of Spanish cuisine. Buen Provecho!    In Spain, quality white or green asparagus is usually eaten at room temperature, on its own, with olive oil or a sauce such as mayonnaise or vinaigrette. Here we have chosen a variation with the juice of citrus fruits to give added sparkle and fruitiness.    ASPARAGUS WITH ORANGE AND LEMON SAUCE    SERVINGS: 4    INGREDIENTS:  2 bottles or large cans of extra large white asparagus or green asparagus, or 1 of each type    SAUCE:  2 yolks of hard-boiled eggs  1 raw egg yolk  1 small tsp lemon juice  1 tbsp orange juice  Pinch of salt, and pepper  1 glass of olive oil  1 egg white    PREPARATION:  Chop the hard-boiled egg yolks and mix with the raw egg yolk. Add the orange and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Gradually add the olive oil, beating as if for mayonnaise. Check the seasoning. Beat the egg white until stiff and add to the sauce. Arrange the well-drained asparagus on a serving dish, pour over the sauce and decorate with slices of orange and lemon.|`|mMxfVTSHaa	Arroz con Pollo (rice and chicken)  Tacos  Quesadillas|`|JVPwpwYlaa	paella...seafood and rice dish with saffron.    http://www.recipezaar.com/Authentic-Span...|`|2TwUZLSsaa	platanos or u take a banana and cut it in thick 1 inch skices bake it till its golden mmmmmmmmm lol|`|ce5DpjWqaa	mmmm spanish food is always good    but if you are making it make some tacos or burritos   for desert ....i dont know post a question about deserts i guess....|`|JZmAOttkaa	Arrroz con Pollo   aka chicken and rice.    if prepared right its delicious, my grandma makes it all the time    recipe: http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/00...|`|mnsN5iYGaa	tres leche cake!|`|68sBhoi3aa	tapas but that is a main meal  some more...  http://www.astray.com/recipes/?show=Span... - Honey pudding  http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,sp... - not sure what this one is  Hope i helpes =o)|`|lWaLw8wkaa	Arroz con pollo (rice and chicken)  Tacos (Taco shell with meat)  Arroz con frijoles (rice and beans)  Paella (seafood dish with rice)|`|zQbpJmESaa	Spanish Chicken  Ingredients  1 large onion, chopped (1 cup)   2 garlic cloves, finely chopped   1 large red bell pepper, chopped (1 and 1/2 c)   1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves   1/2-1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes   1 lb turkey Italian sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces   1 3/4 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces   1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained   1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste   1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, quarters drained   1 (4 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained   3 cups hot cooked rice   http://www.recipezaar.com/Spanish-Chicke...|`|HAVqiBxzaa	Can it be latinamerican?

asMrW7Ozaa	there are loads of other yellow fruits, and we'd have to call them all "yellows" aswell wouldn't we?(:  I don't know of any other orange coloured fruits except an orange so thats why oranges are called oranges  Also theres always someone who would take it the wrong way, always ONE PERSON  ;D|`|ToztjpAsaa	Lemon IS a colour!  It's yellow.|`|qjvAquFnaa	i call lemons yellows.|`|pRoyFWL6aa	Because some p.c.tw*t would class it as racist.|`|L6u8Tgq7aa	An orange is only called an "orange" in english.  probably because the 1st anglophone to see one had no imagination.  cheers  JH|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Actually you have the question backwards.  The fruit isn't named for the color, but rather the color is named after the fruit.  The fruit has been called "orange" since 1300, whereas the word orange has only been used to describe the blend of red and yellow since the mid 1500's.      Lemon comes from the old French "limon" which means citrus fruit, so really you should ask "why isn't the color yellow known as lemon"|`|DFXS4SB4aa	The color orange was actually named after the fruit orange, not the other way around.     "The colour is named after the orange fruit, introduced to Europe via the Sanskrit word nranja. Before this was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in Old English) as geoluhread, which translates into Modern English as yellow-red.    The first recorded use of orange as a colour name in English was in 1512,[1] in the court of King Henry VIII."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(col...|`|PbNa0akOaa	Because it would conflict with a Banana?|`|6I1LFlSIaa	same why red isn't called a strawberry, cherry or any other red fruit.|`|cCTA62Ehaa	same reason that grapes aren't called purples and strawberries aren't called reds. and besides, if you called a lemon a yellow what would you call a banana??|`|AaXl3vcCaa	and why isnt a lime called a green while you are asking|`|K162hc5haa	lemon is a colour.|`|7j50ryNbaa	becuase its called a lemon ...|`|2dpPZx17aa	who cares|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	An orange is an orange hence we have the colour orange named after it or the other way round I think.   A lemon is a lemon but as we are talking about the colour let us remember that the names of the fruits you talk about are in English and these fruits do not originate in England.  Most fruits actually started being named in their origin and the names have been adapted by each country to suit them and in many cases keeping some of the names as near as possible to their original name|`|ydTcGVrMaa	I am not sure on orange, but the word lemon comes from a few other languages that english modified, as it often does.|`|yrCyq05gaa	OMG! the UK yahoo answers is WAY better than american answers!|`|Eiya9qKhaa	Because the colour orange came after the fruit, where as the the colour yellow came before the fruit. This is probably due to yellow being a primary colour. This is only a guess, i don't know for sure :)

Each brand will probably be different).    Toss out the flavor packet and make your own flavored broth for the noodles! Vegetable broth with soy sauce is a good start. I usually make a quick broth for plain ramen noodles out of water, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp mirin, a dash of garlic and onion powders, and a tiny sprinkle of dried basil... tastes pretty good! Add 1 tsp sugar if you want it sweeter. It won't be the same as the flavor packet, of course, but it will be animal free. :)|`|UPwJVE6taa	the Nissin Top Ramen Oriental Flavor are vegetarian [vegan!].   The other Top Ramen flavors, along with other ramen brands (all flavors of e.g. Maruchan, Sapporo Ichiban) are not vegetarian.    look at the ingredients, and you will not be perplexed.  there isn't much to "figure out" when you read things like "beef powder" or "dehydrated chicken"      you're not a bad vegetarian if you didn't know. caring is a lot better than not caring, you know? it helps to make a conscious effort, tho.    when in doubt: don't eat it.

But as with most gluten-free recipes, the cupcakes only rose about half the heighth as gluten cupcakes. But still yummy and real chocolate cake.<br>  <br>  And when I doubled the amount of cocoa and sugar to make it dark chocolate, it made the most heavenly rich moist cake brownies, what a neat discovery, these brownies are to die for. It's just like a real devil's food cake but half the heighth, so I call them cake brownies. You could call it devil's food cake though, gluten-free devil's food cake that only rises half the heighth of gluten cake, haha. It's the real deal, just half the heighth, ha. <br>  <br>  The light-chocolate cake has fine crumbs and is drier than the brownies/devil's food cake variation, kind of dry like a packaged gluten cake mix, but definitely chocolate cake, the real deal, and very tasty. <br>  <br>  And the cake brownies/devil's food cake has big rich moist crumbs texture, like you get with a homemade gluten cake.<br>  <br>  And both get moister and more delicious after sitting for a day or two or more, tightly covered of course. So I would say bake them ahead of time and store them at room temperature at least overnight (and even more moist and delicious as the days go by). <br>  <br>  I frost them all with a heavenly delicious homemade dark chocolate frosting made with powdered sugar, butter, and cocoa (don't know the exact measurements for the frosting, I just mix together a lot of powdered sugar with some butter and cocoa - a basic butter cream frosting with cocoa added).<br>  <br>  I've been meaning to post these two recipes on a topic post, will soon.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chocolate Cake (Light-Chocolate Cake, Not Dark Chocolate)<br>  (Devil's Food Cake/Brownie Variation below main recipe)<br>  <br>  {Here's the gluten-free flour mix I use for this cake and brownies, make it myself:<br>  <br>  Gluten-Free Flour Mix<br>  <br>  3 cups brown rice flour<br>  1 cup potato starch (not potato flour, but potato starch)<br>  1/2 cup tapioca flour (tapioca flour is the exact same thing as tapioca starch)<br>  <br>  I keep this mixture on hand for the cake and brownies.}<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 1/4 cups gluten-free flour mix<br>  2 1/4 teaspoon guar gum<br>  1 teaspoon baking soda<br>  1/4 teaspoon salt<br>  1/2 cup cocoa<br>  <br>  1/2 cup sugar<br>  <br>  1/2 cup oil<br>  1 egg plus enough water to make 3/4 cup<br>  1 1/4 cups honey<br>  1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br>  <br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Butter and flour two 7" cake pans, or muffin pans for cupcakes.<br>  <br>  Sift the flour mix together with the guar gum, baking soda, salt, and cocoa.<br>  <br>  Stir in sugar.<br>  <br>  Crack egg into measuring cup with water to 3/4 cup level. Beat lightly.<br>  <br>  In large mixing bowl, stir together oil, water, egg mixture, honey, and vinegar until well blended.<br>  <br>  Add dry mixture.<br>  <br>  Beat for a few minutes with electric hand mixer.<br>  <br>  Divide batter equally into two 7" pans, or into muffin pans.<br>  <br>  Use a spatula to smooth and even out batter in cake pans.<br>  <br>  Bake cake pans 30 - 40 minutes (*see note below), and muffin pans 20 - 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Cool in pans about 10 minutes then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***For Devil's Food Cake (or I call them brownies), just double the amount of sugar and cocoa to 1 cup sugar and 1 cup cocoa.<br>  <br>  I bake my brownies in a long glass cake pan for about 25 - 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Note:<br>  <br>  The timing on the 7" light-chocolate cake pans doesn't look right to me. I've only made the cupcakes, not the cake in 7" pan, but it seems it should be the same baking time for the 7" pans as it is for the cupcakes and the devil's food cake/cake brownies in the long glass pan! So I would bake the 7" cake pans for the 20 - 30 minutes and check for doneness at that time!|`|H3XOTswzaa	I Make This Cake Before<br>  It Was Lovely<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4508/chocolate-birthday-cake-" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4508/...</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy ! !|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  cooking-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me

Blend oil and milk in bowl. Add to flour mixture. Stir with fork until forms large clumps. Press into ball. Flatten to form 5-6 inch "pancake". Roll between sheets of wax paper. Peel off top sheet. Flip into 9 inch pie pan. Remove other sheet. Press dough into pie plate. Trim and flute.|`|9CN0otoQaa	You could substitute phyllo dough, but I've never seen low-fat pie crust.

5zNwBQZHaa	Well..the site that you linked to is a sales site -you can order them right from that site you posted.    Other than that - you can try eBay, one of my favorite bento suppliers is at: http://stores.ebay.com/Bento-Obento-Shop  They also have a website called www.bentotv.com which they show short videos on how to prepare different bento favorites.    Do you have an Asian grocery store?  They probably carry similar bento boxes in their housewares section.  Since I don't know where you are I would not be able to suggest some place close to you - so it is probably easiest just to order from the Internet.    Other Internet sources for these boxes:    http://houserice.stores.yahoo.net/benbox...  http://www.lunchboxes.com/bento.html (this is for a more American style, and it is all plastic made for kid's lunches)  http://www.cookingcute.com/bento_boxes_a...    Oh wait, I just found a "bento store locater" which might show you a store that sells bento boxes, near you!  It is at: http://lunchinabox.net/bento-store-locat...  It found 4 stores near me!    Good luck and have fun!

A5mCd8qBaa	If you would like them in bulk try this dealer:    http://www.candywarehouse.com/brachshear...    That is about 20 bucks plus shipping for 5 pounds of hearts.  If you don't need 5 pounds it won't be as easy.  The good news is that particular type of candy has a long shelf life (couple years, actually) so you could go that route and have them on hand for whenever you get a hankering.

doz7RIoeaa	Yes.    animals don't sue and don't have to be paid... cruel but that's the reality..    To one poster: Of course pharmaceutical companies have to make money. They are businesses not charity organizations. And how else can they afford to research new medicines. Even those "alternatives" to animal testing that you cry about cost money. Willing to pay for it yourself? How about giving that PETA yearly dues to pay for research instead of PETA using it for Ingrid Newkirk's foreign trips or Pam Anderson's promotional videos and Superbowl ads?  Or paying that idiot who came up with "sea kittens"? You should put your money where your mouth is|`|llkSmgLJaa	There is no alternative, since the FDA requires animal testing for all new drugs. PETA is good at spewing out propaganda, but we are years from developing the non-animal annalogs needed.|`|w3EwRNYQaa	who care's, it's more responsable and less cruel............|`|GY4yYB6jaa	The system is set up for animal research, pockets are being lined every day as a direct result of animal experimentation. A fundamental change in the system would cost billions, which is why the pharmaceutical industries are standing firm and resisting change, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that vivisection is flawed, corrupt and detrimental to human health.    There is just too much money being made right now for them to want to change.    To exfst: The pharmaceutical companies would still make their money from the alternatives, because drugs would still be production. But there is just no incentive right now for them to want to change the system. The profits are more important than any concern for animal welfare. So your assuption that PeTA or anyone else would pay for the testing is completely illogical.|`|UyhmdJKUaa	I heard the opposite. That real Animal Testing costs more than the alternatives.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	yes because if you test products on humans, you have to pay for liability insurance in case your product makes a person sick. Also, you have to pay test subjects, advertise to get people to come to your testing facility, etc. With animal testing there is no law to say that can't do pretty much whatever they want and they don't have to pay anyone.|`|bkw69HoHaa	It depends on each lab. I believe PETA says that animal testing is a much cheaper option which is why it's preferred, and that is probably based off of a numbers game (ie a very small lab working with maybe 5 rats at a time compared to a large cellular lab with millions of dollars worth of grants). If you were to look at the total money that it costs (from set up to finish), I would probably lean that animal testing is much, much more expensive. A cage wash machine alone is hundreds of thousands. Animals aren't cheap either, they are taken extremely well care of at the laboratories that breed them and make sure they carry absolutely no illnesses. Their diets are expensive, people must be hired to clean their rooms and cages. Generally any type of equipment used on an animal is very expensive because they're much smaller and more delicate that human sized equipment. Also the amount of drugs that you'll go thru with an animal is much much more than what you would expose a cell to.   To clear up from a previous poster. Animal testing involves insurance as well, employees working with animals must have workers liability coverage as well as the institution must have insurance and be cleared to have animals. You also don't have to pay test subjects, i'd say the majority of research done on humans is not a way to earn extra cash (maybe $10 or a gift card to the grocery store). And actually there are MANY laws that sanction animal testing. Do you think that anyone can just order animals from a lab and do whatever they want? No one is even allowed in an animal facility without proper clearance and being written into a research proposal, you can't even touch an animal without going thru a course in animal safety. Research facilities must employ many of people to run an animal facility, including a vet (which doesn't come cheap).

EDIT:  You're welcome~    You can at that point add either BBQ sauce and make pulled pork sandwiches out of it (topped with cole slaw, of course) or even just hot pork sandwiches, pork over bread with gravy and mashed taters.....    You can even take the "ribs" after they're shredded and place them BACK in the oven for about 10 minutes, then do the Mexican style, as Carnitas, and serve with salsa, tortillas, rice and beans.......

QaEeITduaa	Each region has their own unique cuisine based on locally available produce and foods. For example, olive oil is used in some cuisine but not in all because not all regions grow olive trees. Italian food is very different from Italian-American foods. For example, Americans cook their pasta to a mushy soft consistency and Italians prefer pasta al dente. There are some Italian-American recipes and dishes that are not Italian such as the "Alfredo sauce." <br>  <br>  I enjoy eating the water buffalo mozzarella from the Campania region. It's usually white round balls in a white watery liquid. The cheese melts in my mouth - yum! I enjoy their fresh seafood with little octopuses. They have lovely rice dishes; however, the grain of rice grown in Italy is different from the Asian varieties. They have a lovely lemon found in the Sorrento area. I have always enjoyed the simplicity of their pizzas. <br>  <br>  You can easily find information on Italian foods online through the Italian tourist bureau. There are also several sites focused on Italians living in Italy. I ran across a site on restaurants in Rome where an Italian could search for the best restaurants in the city. If you speak to some local immigrant groups from Italy (not the long standing Italian-American families who have been in the states for generations after generations) but the ones who actually immigrated as adults themselves from Italy, you'll find out where and how to get the "real" Italian products and foods in your area. You might also check with the Italian-American chamber of commerces in the states as they help Italian companies do business in the USA.|`|MtO5BXOBaa	pasta <br>  pizza<br>  ice cream<br>  parmesan chesse<br>  grand pradano chees<br>  pannacotta<br>  marscapone chees<br>  mozzarella chesse<br>  gnocchi<br>  pesto<br>  fried zucchini flowers<br>  minestrone soup<br>  spagetti bolognese (ragu)<br>  calzone<br>  risotto<br>  theres lots lots more|`|utbfT0APaa	Spaghetti, ravioli and chicken Parmesan.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Polenta cooked various ways<br>  Chianti braised beef ribs<br>  Pesto's (various types)<br>  Pasta e Fagioli (noodle and bean soup)<br>  Frittata <br>  Bruscetta<br>  Tagliatelle with Meat Bolognese Sauce<br>  Butternut squash stuffed Ravioli<br>  Fresh green bean salad with gorgonzola, pancetta, lemon vinaigrette, toopped with sliced lemon and fresh basil<br>  Seafoods<br>  Baked maccheroni with Eggpland and Smoked Mozzarella<br>  Lumache with artichokes, pancetta and thyme (so good)<br>  Shells with sausages, tomatoes and cream<br>  gelato<br>  Almond Lemon cookies<br>  Farfalle with Smoked Salmon and Roasted Bell Peppers<br>  Italilan Sausage, peppers and onions<br>  Linguini topped with marinara, pancetta and gorgonzola<br>  Fried cassari cheese with pita and lemon wedges<br>  Taglitelle with shrimp and asparagus<br>  Fettucini with peas, proscuitto, and cream<br>  Cannoli<br>  Gnocchi<br>  Risotto<br>  Baccala (stockfish)<br>  Herb infused olive oil for cooking or bread dipping<br>  Marinaded artichoke hearts <br>  Marinaded olives and peppers<br>  Sausage soup with tortellini<br>  Chocolate hazelnut cookies<br>  Fennel and citrus salad<br>  Anisette cookies<br>  Pork tenderloin with sage, proscuitto, sun dried tomatoes and cream<br>  Lemon chicken with rosemary and garlic<br>  Veal marsala<br>  Swordfish a la Siciliana <br>  Focaccia Bread, ciabatta<br>  Fig cookies<br>  Chicken Scarpariello <br>  Creamy Italian White Bean Soup <br>  Prosciutto e Melone (Italian Ham and Melon) <br>    Baked Orange Roughy Italian-Style  <br>  Arrabbiata Sauce <br>  Shrimp fra Diavalo<br>  Pannini's<br>  <br>  Bunches more|`|AA10923010	Trying to describe some foods in italy is a long detailed subject it will not all fit here. check the website for regions and their foods.|`|sqR0iyuWaa	spumoni|`|baW9u4yLaa	Milk...bread...all sorts of stuff|`|AQQbH5ebaa	Ah,Italy.Land of food...<br>  <br>  They've got Risotto,Pizza,Spaghetti,Pasta,Lasagna,ti... cake,Porchetta,Ricotta and plenty others.|`|ULqZ5Yw6aa	Pizza pasta and ice cream baby!|`|CssyQVD0aa	Hot Dogs

EMDNVrcjaa	My mother claims it has Taiwanese origins, Wikipedia says it’s origins are from Shanghai (with mention of Hong Kong and Taiwan). I’m all about generalizing, it’s a dish with Chinese origins. Fan Tuan is essentially a sushi roll stuffed with shredded pork, zhai cai (preservered mustard greens) and Chinese donut. If these ingredients are foreign to you…well, it’s time to try new things, right? This dish provides a satisfying crunch and bite all wrapped in sticky rice goodness. Normally it’s eaten for breakfast but I could eat this any time of the day (or night!)This dish is surprisingly easy to make if you have the proper ingredients and equipment on hand (Who actually makes home-made Chinese donuts anyway?)<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>  2 cups sticky rice, uncooked (aka sweet rice or glutinous rice)<br>  2-3 Chinese donuts (ready to eat)<br>  1 package zha cai<br>  1 cup rousong (or yu song)<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  1. Sweet rice preparation - Place rice in a bowl filled with water. Wash the rice repeatedly until the water turns clear (this may take 3-4 times). Drain water and soak the rice in clean water over night.<br>  <br>  2. After the rice has soaked over night, drain and place in the steamer. (If the holes in the steamer are too large and the rice might fall through, line it with cheesecloth first.) Fill the pan with water, making sure it doesn’t touch the steamer. Steam for about 30 minutes and check it. It might need another 10 minutes or so. The consistency of the rice should be sticky and chewy - not mushy!<br>  <br>  3. Rinse the zha cai several times and finely chop.<br>  <br>  4. If your Chinese donuts are freshly made, and delightfully crisp, proceed to step 5. If your Chinese donuts lack on the crunchy factor, put them in the toaster.<br>  <br>  5. Cover a sushi roller (I prefer the ones made out of bamboo) with plastic wrap. The plastic wrap should be the slightly bigger than the size as the sushi roller. Spread a thin layer of sticky rice over half of the bamboo roller.<br>  <br>  6. Place the Chinese donut (cut to fit the size of the bamboo roller), 1-2 tps of zha cai, and a few tablespoons of rousong on the middle portion of the rice.<br>  <br>  7. Roll up rice until the ends of the rice touch (it’s like rolling up sushi). Peel off the plastic wrap as you eat! Peeling it off prior is possible but it gets messy and the plastic wrap keeps the rice from hardening.
2RzEaod9aa	Honestly, that quorn stuff, and other meat/cheese replacements, are just processed junk anyway. I eat them about as often as I eat junk food, which is rarely. Plus, it gets expensive...you'll be amazed at how cheap a vegan diet *really* is as long as you cut the crap. <br>  <br>  Watch out for: milk, whey, and casein (including sodium caseinate and calcium caseinate) as ingredients, as well as egg albumin and albumin.|`|M5HyStReaa	as a vegan, if you don't know what something contains, assume it isn't vegan.<br>  <br>  A lot of biscuits and cereals contain whey powder.<br>  <br>  Items that are fortified with vitamin D most often contain a form that is from Lanolin (sheep wool)|`|3tuwWidiaa	There are no seemingly vegan foods full of dairy.  There are vegetarian foods that are full of dairy, egg, and honey (the three most talked about vegan no-nos).<br>  <br>  If you really want to be on a vegan diet, you should not assume anything with packaged foods.  Unless you're buying fresh fruits and vegetables, you need to check ingredient lists or look for "vegan" on the label.  Even nuts, seeds, and some packaged fruits/vegetables may contain dairy, egg, honey, or other animal products.<br>  <br>  Products from Quorn, Morningstar, Bocca, and other makers of vegetarian products very often put egg and dairy in their products.  Unless they mark it as vegan, there's a good chance it's not.  For example, I just looked at the ingredients in a few Quorn items.  They all included some form of dairy and egg.  Some products actually had "cheese" in the name of the product!<br>  <br>  So, if you're not into read labels, I'd stick to only fresh products.  Even those, if you're really really strict vegan, may have residual animal products.  Almost no one is that strict, but if you are...|`|sDAnuaBYaa	According to wikipedia Quorn uses egg whites as a binder, so I personally don't even consider that vegetarian. Some do, and that's cool. <br>  <br>  You could take a 'flexitarian' view on veganism, and live a generally vegan lifestyle, and just indulge in certain things very occasionally. be a 'fleexan  haha. Just coined that term.|`|AA11534382	If you really want to eat it, eat it. <br>  <br>  You don't have to abide by every strict rule of veganism there is. Just be yourself and don't worry about the standards. Veganism is pretty hardcore. If you can't do it perfectly, that's ok. Every little bit helps.|`|T2IzGMU7aa	here you go <a href="http://www.godairyfree.org/Food-to-Eat/Food-Label-Info/Hidden-Dairy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godairyfree.org/Food-to-Eat/F...</a><br>  <br>  the e numbers are a big one because alot of them are like beetle juice and stuff but supplyers wont release info on whats veg and whats not so you dont know wether or not your eating meat<br>  <br>  i know its very hard avoiding animal ingredients in a meat world<br>  <br>  i eat all the fake alternatives like facon bacon, sweetened soya milk, fake egg, golden syrup extra<br>  <br>  so heres the pitfalls if the link doesnt work<br>  <br>  Artificial Sweeteners – Darn, I guess we will have to suffer with real sugar! Some artificial sweeteners are derived from dairy foods. <br>  <br>  Baby Formula - Read the labels carefully on this one. Babies can have much more severe allergic reactions to milk than adults.<br>  <br>  Bakery Goods – This is a hard one to verify, although many fresh bakery goods do come labeled with ingredients. <br>  <br>  Baking Mixes (cakes, biscuits, pancakes, etc.) – Read up, there are some okay brands. <br>  <br>  Bath Products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.) – Okay, so these are not food items, but those who tend to have skin reactions to milk products (i.e. eczema) may want to avoid topical application. <br>  <br>  Bread – Whey is a common preservative in breads. Also, other milk proteins and possibly cheese or butter may be included, depending on the type and brand. <br>  <br>  Breath Mints – Not all, but a few do contain casein related ingredients. <br>  <br>  Candy – Much of the candy world (of the non-chocolate variety) is free game from a dairy free point of view, not from a health perspective of course, but there are a few to watch out for. <br>  <br>  Canned Tuna Fish – Some contain hydrolized caseinate, check out our Product List for the good ones. <br>  <br>  Caramel – This is a highly suspicious food and ingredient. It may either be made from sugar and water or milk. <br>  <br>  Cereal - Dry and instant cereals vary significantly in ingredients. Even the same type of cereal may contain milk ingredients in the brand name, but not in the generic version. <br>  <br>  Chewing Gum – Okay, now this is a weird one. Some brands do actually contain milk protein ingredients. <br>  <br>  Chocolate – Milk chocolate is a given, but some semi-sweet and dark chocolate brands have milk ingredients as well. Luckily the better tasting ones don't, check our Product List for some excellent dairy free chocolates. <br>  <br>  Chocolate Drinks – Even the non-milk varieties frequently have some dairy to beef them up. <br>  <br>  Coffee Whiteners / Creamers - Well, something has to make them white and creamy. <br>  <br>  Cookies & Crackers – Often the most processed foods of them all. <br>  <br>  Cream Liqueurs – These may possess solid milk ingredients or caseinates. <br>  <br>  Custard / Pudding – Most contain milk products, although a few are dairy free. <br>  <br>  Drugs / Medications - Lactose is used as the base for more than 20 percent of prescription drugs and about 6 percent of over-the-counter medicines and vitamins. <br>  <br>  Eggnog - Try some soy-nog, or make an at home version with other "milk" alternatives. <br>  <br>  Fat Replacers - Some are derived from milk, such as Simplesse? & Dairy-Lo?.<br>  <br>  Fondues - Isn't this the word the Swiss use for cheese? <br>  <br>  Fried Foods – The breading on fried foods can contain many mysterious substances. Also, cheese is commonly added for flavor and texture. <br>  <br>  Ghee - This is technically pure butter fat, no proteins or sugars, but some argue that trace amounts may still linger. <br>  <br>  Goat’s Milk – Although slightly different, goat’s milk has proteins similar in structure to cow’s milk proteins, and thus is often an allergen for those with cow’s milk allergy. Also, goat’s milk contains a significant amount of lactose, just a touch less than cow’s milk, and thus not suitable for those with lactose intolerance. <br>  <br>  Granola & Nutrition Bars - Just like cookies, various milk additives could be in there. <br>  <br>  Gravies - Some utilize milk ingredients for flavor and texture. <br>  <br>  Hot Cocoa Mix - The best varieties are pure cocoa and sugar, but some have milk ingredients added for a creamier drink. <br>  <br>  Hot Dogs - What isn't in hot dogs? <br>  <br>  Imitation Maple and Other Syrups - Go for the real stuff, it tastes much better! <br>  <br>  Instant Potatoes - Particularly the Au Gratin varieties. <br>  <br>  Kosher Parve Desserts - Most parve foods are okay, but those with highly sensitive milk allergies may have a problem with the desserts. <br>  <br>  Lactose Free Milks - These will still be loaded with milk proteins. <br>  <br>  Lunch Meats & Sausages - Some "meat allergies" are actually dairy allergies in disguise. Lactose and caseinates are common in these foods, as well as ingredient cross-contamination. <br>  <br>  Margarine - Most are not dairy free, and many are rich in hydrogenated oils. <br>  <br>  Meal Replacement / Protein Powders & Beverages – Those instant breakfast mixes and muscle beverages may contain powdered milk, or other milk derived ingredients. <br>  <br>  Peanut Butter - A very few may contain milk solids. <br>  <br>  Potato Chips – Particularly risky among the flavored varieties, although several brands and f|`|hEbdJltFaa	i would check your local grocery store to see what there is.
AA11173395	You might want to get "Becoming Vegan" by Brenda Vesanto, it's full of advice and encouragement for making the transition.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to avoid animal ingredients is to avoid processed foods, so a good cookbook is essential.  If I had to pick just one, it would definitely be Veganomicon.  Even if you've never cooked much, you'll be able to follow the instructions.<br>  <br>  If you're going out, you can almost always get a tossed salad with veggies and oil & vinegar, or pasta (just not egg noodles!) with steamed veggies and olive oil or tomato sauce.  It's really helpful if you can check a menu online before you go.<br>  <br>  And very important- when you accidentally eat an animal product- don't freak out and eat a Big Mac.  Just say "Crap!  Well, I won't do that again!"  It happens- to all of us- even after 20 years!  Not so long ago I was in a bar and the waiter set a dish of olives on the table.  I thought it was just green olives in bloody mary mix, but I found out later that there was Clamato in it.

They also wrote Skinny ***** which has a listing of the best tasting brand of Nayonnaise, soy cheese, etc, which is helpful to skip some trial and error.  Also, I always check out websites that list local vegan-friendly retaurants in whatever area I'm in.

Remind yourself why you're vegan and appreciate how it feels, physically and spiritually/mentally/emotionally. That way, when douche bags try to insult you, you aren't as bothered by it.<br>  <br>  2. Instead of looking for meat replacements, use veganism as a chance to try new plant-based foods. For example, I made vegan chili and threw some polenta in it, and I'd never had polenta before but wanted to try it. I buy eggplant more often now because before, as an omni, it would just rot in the fridge. <br>  <br>  3. Just jump in...no need to wean yourself off. I went from omni to vegan in one day.<br>  <br>  4. Email me if you have questions or need support.

I think the cold helps prevent the potatoes from growing those roots.|`|OkR3hrzZaa	They can last pretty long in the fridge. It also depends on how fresh they were when you baught them. I noticed that at certain grocery stores the veggies go bad a lot faster. You will know if they were bad. They smell and have mold. You could check them by cutting one open. If they smell fresh than they are good. Potatoes last a long time in the fridge. But if you are still unsure I would just buy new ones.
4qT0TfMZaa	First, chill the meat; it'll slice easier. Then cut it into strrips one inch wide and from four to five inches long.  Then place it in a bowl and cover it with beer - or marsala - and let it sit in the fridge for at least two hours - overnight is best.  Then heat up a skillet with a tablespoon of cooking oil and sear the meat. Add beer or marsala - that's red cooking wine that I think tastes better than beer - bring the liquid with the meat in it to a simmer, toss in a thickly-sliced onion, some sliced fresh carrots and a couple chunked-up potatoes, put hhe cover on the skillet, reduce the heat until it's just simmering, and let 'er cook fur 75 minutes.  Your beef will be nice and tender and ready to rock.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	There is a great Belgian stew called Carbonnade that uses beer.     Carbonnade: Beef and Beer Stew Recipe         Ingredients        * 3 1/2 lbs chuck roast or top blade steaks, 1 inch thick, trimmed of gristle and fat and cut into 1-inch pieces      * Salt and freshly ground black pepper      * 3 Tbsp olive oil      * 3 medium yellow onions sliced about 1/4 inch thick (about 8 cups)      * 1 Tbsp tomato paste      * 2 medium garlic cloves, minced      * 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour      * 1 1/2 cups chicken or beef broth      * 1 1/2 cups (12 oz bottle) dark ale or stout beer      * 4 sprigs fresh thyme, tied with kitchen twine      * 2 bay leaves      * 1 Tbsp cider vinegar    Method    1 Adjust oven rack to lower middle postion; preheat oven to 300F. Pat beef dry with paper towels, then season well with salt and pepper. On the stove top, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large heavy bottomed dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot, almost smoking. Add a third of the beef to the pot, not crowding the pan. Brown the meat, without stirring, about 3 minutes, then turn the pieces and brown on another side (again, do not stir, give the meat an opportunity to brown well). Transfer browned beef to a separate bowl. Repeat with second third of the beef and an additional 2 teaspoons of oil. Repeat again with 2 more teaspoons of oil and the remaining beef. Remove beef from the dutch oven. Add a half a cup of the broth to the pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour this liquid into the bowl with the browned beef.    2 Add 1 Tbsp oil to dutch oven; reduce heat to medium. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon of salt; cook until onions are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and stir until onions are evenly coated and flour is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth, scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits; stir in beer, thyme, bay, vinegar, browned beef with any of the accumulated juices, and salt and pepper to taste. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a full simmer, stirring occasionally; cover partially, then place pot in oven. Cook until fork tender, about 2 hours.    3 Discard thyme and bay leaf. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper to taste and serve. Can serve plain or over egg noodles, rice, or potatoes.    Serves 6.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Do a search for beer marinades or other marinades.  Now was not that easy?  You can use your toaster oven as you would your oven as long as it is a good one and keeps the temp right.  I use mine all the time to save energy.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	What type of beef?   Put the beer in a big zip-lock baggie, with the beef; salt & pepper; and whatever herbs or spices you like - refrigerate overnight (if it's a cheaper, tougher cut of meat), turning it several times.  Alcohol is an excellent tenderizer for tougher cuts of meat.  I have no idea what you'd make with a toaster oven though.  If it's a pot roast, you can simmer it for hours on top of your stove;  and if it's steaks, you can pan fry them (or buy a cheap hibachi BBQ for about $5).  Also, consider buying a crockpot

I guess you might be tired of chicken though. I have been craving turkey lately. You could get a small breast of turkey and add a salad or steamed veggies. You'd have enough left over to put in salads or make wraps or sandwiches out of. An omelet is a good idea. Eggs aren't that fattening and they are filling. You could add vegetables of your choice and a little cheese for a nice meal.

A found an enchilada recipe a few months back but I don't remember where I found it but:    Ingredients:   1-1 and 1/2 pounds of chicken  1 pkg of 20 tortilla's  36 oz sour cream  3, 10 and 3/4 oz cans of cream of chicken  1 can diced green peppers (small)  2 cans sliced black olives  1 pound Shredded Cheddar Cheese (sharp is best)  1, 10 oz can of Old Elpaso Enchalada sauce (choose your own heat ie hot, mild, ect...)  1 Lime  Salt   Pepper  Chilli Powder    Instructions:  Chop chicken into small chunks, place into pan with 1/4 cup water, on Medium heat. Stir in 1/2 Tblsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 2 Tblsp Chilli powder for mild, more if you want more heat. Squeeze the lime over chicken while cooking.   While the chicken is cooking, in a large mixing bowl add sour cream, cream of chicken, green peppers, black olives, and 1/2 of the cheese. Mix together.  When chicken is cooked, strain and add it to the mixture in the bowl. Turn oven to 300 degrees. Grease a 9x13 in. pan. Put a thin layer (about 1 cup of the mix) into the bottom of the pan. Put 1/4 cup mix into a tortilla and roll it up and place it in the bottom of the pan. Do this till the pan is full.  When the pan is full, Spread about 2 cups of the mix over the top of the enchiladas. Add the rest of the cheese to the top. Cover with tin foil and cook for 1 and 1/2 hours. After pulling out of the oven, pull foil off and place back in the oven on broil to brown the cheese, about 2-5 min. Let cool and enjoy!     You could also make lasgna.
