20090204234246AAguHwQ	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Is there any fighter-jet that can achieve a 'near verticle' ascent/climb at phenomenal velocity ?	apart from a shuttle take off which I think is vertical at lift off, is there any type of fighter jet that can fly almost 90 degrees upwards into the sky ?      my dads friend, a retired Indian Airforce pilot flew a particular MIG in the late 60s early 70s and told my dad about how it use to knock the wind out of him and leave him physically exhausted and drained, but my dad can't recollect the name/model of the particular mig plane.      I watched a tv documentary on worlds most deadly fighter planes back in the late 90s, and I seem to recall how a mig jet designed to 'bomb and fly away without giving time to be locked to radar' was able tio achieve this feat of near vertical ascents.      what plane is this ? is there even such a plane that could do that ?

It decays into two gamma rays, bursts of electromagnetic radiation that travel at the speed of light.    A pion moving through the laboratory at v = 0.98c decays into two gamma rays of equal energies, making equal angles  with the direction of motion.  Find the angle  and the energies of the two gamma rays.  (HINT: Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation with E = pc.)    Thanks everyone...this one seems tough.

20090205040846AAdJYv8	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Did Albert Einstein forsee chaos in the world and retract his cosmological constant theory?	Why did Einstein really retract his cosmological constant theory?      He called it his biggest blunder, but today more and more proof is found for the existence of his constant.      The big bang theory has been created by a catholic priest.      See:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl3Uj2UJj...       The Big Bang theory creates a day without a yesterday, as described in the bible.       However, theoretically, it does not make sense. If gravity would win, nothing can be. And Einstein forsaw that.      So why did he really retract his theory, that has major implications for everything else in life, our society and scientific evolution?      Did he do it for his religious friends?

I don't feel it NEARLY as much as they claim to. We live in a very moderate climate. My theory is that they spend way too much time indoors, like most kids these days, so their bodies can't handle the shock very well when they go out. Do you believe this to be true of kids today in general? Has anyone studied it? What would you suggest as a good name for it? I told my daughter this morning she had "digital body core disregulation syndrome." But I just madee that up on the fly.

When someone like Michael Behe proposes that the blood clotting mechanism is irreducibly complex, why does he not vigorously research the databases of vertebrate genome sequences. Shouldn't he be attempting to reinforce his claim with evidence, and what better evidence for the irreducible complexity of the current blood clotting system than to demonstrate that no parts of the system, separate from the whole, can be found in any genome sequence of any vertebrate? Seems that such a momentous breakthrough in scientific discovery would cause him and other advocates to race for all the evidence they could muster.

20090205090858AAXgP2D	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Explain the choice of instruments used in the forensic investigation below?	Explain the choice of instruments used in the forensic investigation below?      I carried out three analytical experiments.   Two of the experiments were spectroscopic techniques and one was a chromatographic technique.   In the spectroscopic technique experiments I was provided with river water evidence sample and had to determine whether it was unpolluted (no coloured dye present) or if the sample contains any level of the pollutants in the water.   In the first experiment I used a colorimeter to determine the absorbance values for the river water at a range of wavelengths.   In the second experiment I used a colorimeter again to determine the absorbance values for the water reference samples of known concentration.   In the third experiment I placed the river water sample along with five dyes on a chromatogram to determine which dyes the river water contained.

20090205093132AAc4EB9	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Can you average the Richter scale eventhough each integer is a factor 10 above previous number?	I'm wanting to know if you can average using the mean (X1+X2+X3...Xn)/n of earthquakes using the Richter Scale?  The Richter Scale appears numerical but each number actually represents a different set of numbers that increase in factors of ten per integer.  Because of this factor can you really average using the statistical formula of "means" to find an average strength of earthquakes.  For example: does the average (mean) strength of six earthquakes 4.5,4.6,5.1,6.2,7.1,8.1 = 5.93 or would the value be higher to truly reflect the significant increase in earthquake strength of the last three example values of 6.2, 7.1 & 8.1.      The person answering should probably be more of a seismologist than a mathematician.  If you REALLY don't know the answer don't guess (or copy/paste some dumbass link), as i have a Master's in Economics with an emphasis in Statistics and I don't know the answer.      Thanks      sean

20090205075941AAHTufI	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	A truly fascinating topic?	We are composed of the same substances found in the heavens, so it really is not so odd that celestial events should profoundly impact us. Harvard professor of astronomy Robert Kirshner has remarked that “supernovas created the elements we take for granted–the oxygen we breathe, the calcium in our bones, and the iron in our blood are products of the stars.” Other researchers, observing that most of DNA's amino acids are also found in space, have hypothesized that DNA actually came from space–an increasingly popular theory known as “Panspermia.”      Does this give anyone a new perspective on the origins of life on earth?

Honeybees actively foraging in the field have been found to be electrically charged, due largely to air resistance as they fly. The charges carried by a bee, which can be as great as 92 pC, is thought to play a significant role in pollination -- the bee can detach grains of pollen from a distance, like a charged comb attracting bits of paper. Given the force required to detach pollen from an avocado stigma is 4.5 multiplied by 10^-10 N, find the maximum distance at which the electrostatic force between a bee and a grain of pollen is sufficient to detach the pollen. Treat the bee and pollen as point charges, and assume that the pollen has a charge opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to the bee.   ______ m

20090204222350AAo2d9Z	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How does a mirror reflect greater than its size ?	If you stand parallel to the surface of a mirror and not perpendicular to it  .  You are basically looking parallel to its glass surface . And you move say about 1 foot away from the wall mounted mirror. You turn your eyes acutely into the mirror glass . Then how is it that you can look into the mirror at some acute angle and see things beyond the periphery ( size ) of the mirror ?        Say the mirror is 2 feet square . you stand parallel , at the west edge of the mirror .You move 1 foot off the wall but basically view parallel to the glass . You turn slightly inward toward the mirror   looking acutely into some part of the mirror .  ( eg )  12 degree angle ?  At the far edge east end of the mirror you can see well beyond the dimension of the mirror . In other words you are seeing things that are not perpendicular to the mirror at all but perhaps 8 feet beyond the edge of the mirror .

20090204224610AAfnkFr	Science & Mathematics;Biology	What's with this egg-tasting burp?	Earlier this morning (Well more like yesterday since it's already Thursday at 1:40am) I started getting burps out of nowhere that tasted like eggs and I rarely eat eggs. But not too long after the weird burps, my tummy area started killing me so I thought I could be hungry and ate a piece of toast, some water, and some soy milk. That made it feel a little bit better but it still hurt so I went to go lay down. While I was sleeping, I couldn't feel any pain (Because if I did, I'd figured I'd wake up). Then towards the afternoon/night, I started getting diarrhea. Diarrhea's gone and so is the tummy pain but now it's back to that weird burp and I've been getting like a tingley feeling under my tongue (that usually means I'm going to throw up). Does anyone know what this is and what I can do to get better?

One of our classmates asked, "could it be possible to have 0 velocity with acceleration"      My classmates and my teacher answered NO, its because when there is acceleration, there is also velocity..      My answer to that question is YES, i explained that like us, we are affected by the gravity, WE ARE ACCELERATING that's why we have weight... ALSO, when you push a rock, even though it's not moving, still you have applied force, F=ma so it means there is acceleration with Velocity..      I'm going to ask you guys for your feed backs and suggestions... Thanks

20090205082655AAb6Ez8	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Do humans give off positive/negative energy?	So, I got into a debate with friend about humans giving off positive and negetive "energy". She said that there must be some kind of energy emanating from people because peoples moods will change depending on their environment. Ex: if you are happy and then sit in a room with a bunch of angry or upset people - you will then be affected by that negetive energy and lose your happines on some sort of cellular or unknown level.            I say that this is completely retarted and people do not emanate an energy. And, if they did emanate an "energy" it would not be positive/negetive relating to our emotions, since those are subjective to the individual anyway.        Unfortunately, I dont have enough of a science background to say 100% that my response is truth. I am sure that if there were any energy radiating from people (electrons, etc.) that it would HAVE to be quantifiable and we would already know about it. Does anyone have any scientific evidence to back this up? Thank you in advance!      Randy
