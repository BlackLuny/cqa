20090307171836AAt1xAa	Sports;Basketball	Okay, so I'm having a little problem (Vert Jump)?	So, I read somewhere that dropping the rim to 9'6" or so to just feel if you are dunking right was a good idea.  So, I tried this, and found out that even when I lower the rim, that I still have an incredibly hard time dunking straight on, or just going up with 2 feet period.  I find i can start from the left side and reverse it going up on only my left leg and get up to the rim with no problem, but am unable to do this on my right leg or off of two legs at all.     I'm not sure, but the reason might be that I am coming off a broken foot(Right) and still a little tender.  Should I be worried about this, or will this problem go away as I get my body in better condition?

People tend to forget Jeter had a hurt hand during much of the first half of the season last year and then he hit in the .340's the last 2 months of the season, so i expect that to continue.

I joined a Roller Derby team about 2 months ago, and still cannot think of a name :( (At least one that is not already taken)  Here's a little about me-    I love music- a really clever name that someone else thought of along these lines is "Beyonslay"   I love the 80's, especially 80's music. My #1 choice for a name, that was already taken, was "Punky Bruiser", for example.    I'm pretty short (5ft). I can't have a name that is overtly sexual, because my 8 and 10 yr old brothers would like to come to the bouts.  It doesn't have to be 80's related, I like clever word play too. (ie, "Pina Collida", "Karma Suture", "Shenida Stretcher"-all of which are taken by other derby girls)  PS- if you are any of the derby girls with these names I've used, awesome name picking!        I am usually pretty clever when it comes to things like this, but I guess since it's my own roller derby name, I'm having a torturous time thinking of one.  I would REALLY appreciate any help!!
