I commute to Los Angeles so I know about the traffic.  The 405 (it is free) is not too bad at certain times and there are local streets you can take as a back way if needed.  Toll Road can cost you $4.50 and I use it on the way home on Fridays and going out on Monday's.  Outside of that you will be better off just taking the 405 for a bit.

repO76qoaa	No. <br>  <br>  I'm guessing that your vehicle is burning oil too. <br>  <br>  You'd have to determine how the oil is getting into the cylinders. A compression check will give you more information. <br>  <br>  The oil may be getting into the cylinders via bypassing the cylinder rings or by leaking valves. <br>  <br>  I'd start by changing the plugs and checking the compression. After that, repost another question for further info.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	nope they should,nt have oil on them especially the firing tip. if it,s only on the threads then probably you have a valve pan leaking. if it,s on the tip of the plugs then you probably have bad valve seals, oil rings or guides.|`|AA12261615	if its on the inside of the plugs its not a good sign, if its on the outside then that means it has an oil leak from the valve cover and that can be replaced,replace the gasket if needed and that will stop it from doing that,if its on the inside of the plugs then its burning oil and fouling out the plugs,you can us non foulers on it and stop it drom doing that,good luck.|`|nAK8bm91aa	You have worn piston rings, allowing the oil to pass into the cylinders. Now this gets on the plugs and creates a hard start. You must now use whats called Hot plugs that fire in oil no matter what. I will bet blue smoke comes out of your tailpipe.<br>  No it is not advised to use used pistons from another vehicle. And unless your doing this, chances are 1 in 10,000 you'd be able to do it yourself without experience, skill, knowledge.<br>  You must now resort to a thicker viscosity oil, like 10w40....or 10w50|`|Wm1iDcB4aa	not good. your piston rings need to be replaced. the oil is passing the rings and that means the air is to. thats why it takes more cranks to build enough compression to start. the smoke i'm sure it's blowing is the oil getting past the rings being burned. take it to any local mechanic and have them do a compression test. hope that helps|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	How many miles on the engine?

tt9bwlg5aa	The best way to find a good body person is to ask plenty of questions. As far as the paint color. You will simply need to tell them the year of caddy (with the black paint). They should then be able to show you a paint chart in which you are able to choose your color. Tell them that you will want all cosmetics repaired (dents, rust and deep scratches). Usually the original paint will not be removed unless you request it. However this is a very time consuming task, so be prepared for a hefty price increase for this. The type of paint used is also a factor in the price. I am generally using base/clear coat in place of acrylic. As far as a typical price... there is none. Just about every where that you go, you will find that they will charge different prices for different things. Now having said that, It would not be a wise move to pick the body shop with the lowest prices as you wouldn't want to forget the old saying..."You get what you pay for." Hope that this helps. Good luck|`|UQWusO1waa	Then DONT go to a dealer, taking advantage of people is there prime objective.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	Go by Reputation...Ask around...it's your best bet...<br>  <br>        Many dealerships now-days are getting away from running body<br>      <br>        shops and are using outside sources for bodywork. I would<br>  <br>        personally avoid the dealerships for this type of work.<br>  <br>        Take your time and you'll be happy in the end...<br>  <br>        Good Luck with the New Look....|`|P1J8Tg8Qaa	They will paint over your existing color, but that's ok. if they are a reputable shop, you shouldn't have any surprises. but ask them if the Jams are included in the color change. So when you open up the doors you don't have 2 different colors. ask them if they mask off door handles and trim. or if they remove them. If they remove them you have a lesser chance of the paint flaking  there. Just tell them you want the dents taken care of and they will fix them. Price is going to vary greatly. You get what you pay for though. (or at least make sure you do) You will pay less for a paint job where everything is just masked up and sprayed. and you will pay more for them to remove everything and spray the jams. I would guess ball park price range would be around $3,000 +/-.<br>  <br>  Do a little research on shops in your area. just because they are a dealer, doesn't mean they are better. read some reviews and ask around. then make your decision.

The examiner isn't out to get you, there is no "quota" to be fulfilled, if you're good enough you'll pass, simple as that. Listen to what he says, and if you don't understand they really don't mind you saying so - it's in everybody's interest for you to know what is required!<br>  <br>  It's quite normal to be nervous before the test, in fact that's no bad idea as it keeps you alert, and most people, when they've passed say "I don't know what I was worrying about!"<br>  <br>  Finally, consider this as your chance to show how well you can drive, you know you can . . .|`|rnVdxXotaa	To pass your test you need to make sure that you drive safely and obey the rules of the road as well as successfully carry out 2 manoeuvres that you and your instructor should have done.<br>  <br>  There aren't really pass and fail points but you can get a maximum of 15 minor faults (minor faults are small things like stalling the engine for example) <br>  Then there are serious and dangerous faults which if you get even one you will fail. These are as the name suggests things that are serious or dangerous, for example a serious or dangerous fault would be changing lanes without checking your mirrors or causing someone to change direction, etc.<br>  <br>  If you know how to drive properly then you should pass, your instructor should tell you if your ready for your test. Just try to make sure the nerves don't get to you and you should be just fine.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	don't worry, just take your time and think positive.

Leave a ice cream sandwich on the passenger seat, or soak it in old beer.  Wetter is better.<br>     Make sure not to wash or vacuum the car. Old McDonald wrappers and some fries and catsup packets inside helps.    And have it full of crap in the back seat including beer bottles, or cans.  If you can , have some empty pop cans on strings with a marble or 2 inside, dangling in the engine compartment so that they hit and rattle so the car sounds like it is falling apart.  Also add 2 cycle oil to the  gas tank to give that "misty look" while the engine is running..

The wing was designed with increased thickness and a longer span than previous airliners, resulting in improved payload and range, improved takeoff performance, and a higher cruising altitude than prior aircraft.Folding wingtips were offered when the 777 was launched, to appeal to airlines who might use the aircraft in gates made to accommodate smaller aircraft, but no airline purchased this option

Be sure the inception date is the same as the expiration date on the Commerce policy so there's no gap, because if there' is a gap, Murphy's Law will surely step in.  As a courtesy to the old company, let them know you've switched and won't be renewing, and be sure to tell them the new company so there's no question.  This could also prevent billing problems later.

F8C0SpRjaa	a car with 16 valves has 4 per cylinder, 2 intake and 2 exhaust.  An 8 valve engine has 2 per cylinder.<br>  <br>  In this case because the engine size is bigger your new car is most likely going to be faster and more powerful than your old one, but a 1.6 16v engine would be more powerful than the 8v at the cost of fuel efficiency because the engine can burn fuel faster.<br>  <br>  My last car was a 8v 1.6 litre Astra and it had plenty of power and good MPG|`|KQpT68AKaa	8V and 16V are the numbers of valves for each engine. The 16 Valve engine has 4 valves per cylinder whereas the 8 valve engine has 2 valves per cylinder. The function of the inlet valves is to allow the gas (petrol/air) to enter the cylinder and, after the gas has been ignited, the outlet valves allow the spent gas to be expelled to the exhaust system. The 16V engine will be more powerful for two reasons 1) because it is larger 2) because it has 4 valves per cylinder.|`|GHefTsUyaa	8 v.|`|mKVFIklaaa	The number of valves isn't really relevant unless you want to get into technicalities: Your new car has a bigger engine & should therefore be more powerful, quicker but less economical if the two cars are of similar size & type.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	The size of your cars engine is measured in litres , your old car has a 1.2 litre engine where as your new car has a 1.6 litre engine. Now that's 0.4 litres more than your old car or 1 1/3 times your old cars engine size.I would expect that means its a lot faster !!!!!<br>  The other bit of information is to do with how many valves your engine has, the old one had 16 valves where as your new one only has 8 valves.The valves allow fuel into your engine and at a different time, also let exhaust fumes out.This will have some effect on your engines overall performance but not really significant when comparing power, where the engine size is the all important figure to look at.<br>  Im not sure if your new car will be better at fuel consumption as it has a larger engine , however if its a newer car then it may well also have improved efficiency and therefore more miles per gallon !|`|fO5JWKMlaa	i think youre talking about valves. <br>  <br>  the 16 valves had two valves per cyclinder for intake and two valves for exhaust.<br>  <br>  the new car has one each.  will it be faster? the displacement is bigger so probably|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	the more valves a engine has the quicker the fuel enters and exits the engine...16v are generally quicker than an 8 valve engine...insurance costs a little more though.|`|n7uoE9wmaa	Faster and use more fuel

Faster, safer, more comfortable, more reliable (by an order-of-magnitude) and more fun.<br>  <br>  I'll never go back.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Unless you know what you're getting into, you'll be disappointed;<br>  The Stag was a fantastic car, very good suspension design & handling, very quick, but it's reputation was marred by being one of the first cars to have a cast iron engine block & aluminium cylinder heads - this meant that any fault with the cooling system would lead to warped heads & failed gaskets, in an era where this was a very uncommon problem. Many owners fitted Ford V6 or Rover V8 engines to overcome the problem, but a well maintained example shouldn't be a worry.<br>  Ironically, head gasket failures are very common on a lot of modern cars, but it doesn't seem to put people off buying them.<br>  The MGB was a good car when it came out, but that was around 50 years ago now, so in comparison to any modern car, they're noisy, poor handling, slow, unreliable and very, very prone to rot.<br>  <br>  Both cars are very old, and even new cars of that age leaked in the rain, and practicalities are very, very limited: Poor heaters, poor wipers, they need frequent maintenance, they will always be leaking oil onto your garage floor from some point (don't even think about either unless you have a garage to keep them in - these are strictly weekend toys)<br>  <br>  To be absolutely honest, for top down cheap thrills, I'd go for a Mazda MX-5. Quick, reliable, good handling, economical - I know it's not a classic, but the earlier models are now twenty years old so are actually classed as classics.

The average mileage for a vehicle is 12,000-15,000 per year, this is over double that. If it's been properly maintained and those were highway miles, you are probably okay.

I have a tahoe and to fix GM vehicles, it is so cheap and their great cars. just make sure you look under the hood AND under the car to make sure everything looks like its in place and nothing crazy or bizzare is going on. <br>  <br>  Good Luck !!

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	As far as I know the Rebel and Nighthawk only come in the 250cc displacement. You will not be happy with either of those bikes at your size. Just stick with any 600cc to 650cc twin, not in-line 4, and you will be fine. You may want to go sit on as many different models/brands as possible since you are a tall guy. Some of the bikes will feel more cramped than others so don't rush in to this. Take your time and sit on bikes from all 4 of the Japanese manufacturers before spending all of that money.|`|Dvx9JquIaa	Of those 3 definitely go with the Shadow VLX600. You will not be happy with a 250cc. Especially at your size. The Shadow will be a good dependable first bike. It's got enough power to get you around town and out on the highway when you're ready to do that.|`|aQBmBjG6aa	I used to own a 2004 vlx600. It was not a bad bike as long as I rode by myself and there was little wind. The vlx 600 is pretty gutless. I had problems riding against the wind on the interstate. If I had on a passenger I could barely get going the speed limit on the interstate. Needless to say that it is not good for the bike to ride under that stress. If I were you I would go for something a little bit bigger like a vulcan 800 classic or a 900 custom. I bought a 2007 900 custom and I love it. Really good power on this bike and I can cruise down the interstate no problem with a passenger. Very easy bike to ride and control. Also you will not outgrow this bike.  Good luck|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	The Rebel also came with a 400cc engine (in the 1980s)<br>  The Nighthawk came with a 750cc engine.<br>  <br>  I own a '95 VLX and am completely sold on it. It has forward controls, which is something a six-footer should consider.<br>  My missus inherited mine for several years, then my son (also a six-footer) rode it for a while. <br>  Its been on several  rides of over 200 miles (one way) and ran along side a GL1500-C and a Road King.

This will cost you at LEAST $2000 depending upon what else needs to be replaced.<br>  <br>  As far as taking the oil pan off & taking the pistons out from the bottom; that's ridiculous!

The problem with the repair is the amount of labor that will go into fixing it.

Next time you try and start.  Bam everything is dead.|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	try getting a jump start if it starts and dies it's probably the alternator if it starts and runs till you turn it off and won't start again it's probably the battery get it tested at autozone they'll test it for free|`|sGoEj6qsaa	Battery probably; they only last a few years - whether you leave something on or not, they just wear out and die after a few years and need to be replaced.|`|crhJLuw5aa	Before you go jumping to conclusions, take the terminals off the battery & clean the posts real good. That's the most LIKELY thing. If that doesn't work, then maybe you can start worrying that it might be a bad battery, but even THEN it's STILL doubtful. While it IS possible for a battery to go completely dead all by itself, it rarely happens that way. Usually a  bad battery will still keep a residual charge, at least enough to allow the lights to work. <br>  <br>  One of the door switchs may have gone bad, which would leave the overhead light on all night. The brake light switch could be defective, making the brake lights stay on. Any number of things could be causing a drain on the battery. One common cause of a battery drain is a short in the alternator.<br>  <br>  Point being, when a battery goes dead,don't just AUTOMATICALLY assume it's the battery. Take the battery up to AutoZone, they'll test it for you for free. Just make sure they put it on a charger & fully charge it first. It's not possible to accurately test a battery unless it's fully charged.|`|ul6P8doWaa	A good way of checking to see if you have a bad alternator is, when you're able to start your car again, disconnect the battery cables while the car is on idle and if the car dies, then you have a bad alternator....a good working alternator will not let the car die.  Your problem may just be a drained battery which either needs to be replaced or recharged (if an old battery, you're better off replacing it with a new one)..........good luck!|`|OF64jyPSaa	batteries have a limited lifetime of 2 yrs in good weather if yours is affected by colder climates id changem sooner|`|AA11454606	Still a dead battery my friend.|`|Wmz1gB3Maa	2 years is a very short amount of time to expect a battery to last, but closer to 4-5.<br>  Also, if its not a higher grade battery, they will just die. Start fine one morning, nothing at all the next. When you get a new battery get them to test your alternator too, because you are just going to eat that battery up if your alternator is no good.<br>  A lot of the time an alternator will be charging, not a whole lot lower then they should, but enough to just drain the life out of a battery,

ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	Certainly threaten to sue - unlawful arrest/imprisonment are torts for which compensation can be awarded. Do that through the MD or CEO of Southeastern Trains, don't speak to anyone lower in the pecking order. So far as I am aware individuals such as those you mention have neither the power of arrest nor of detention. Did you get their names? Their actions might also be criminal and you might like to consider a complaint to the police<br>  <br>  But I am interested to know why that acted in this manner. What reason did they give? What were you doing at the time of the incident? What time of day was it? Did you ask for the Transport Police to be called?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, at the present time some petty railway officials are acting way beyond their powers. There have been numerous reports in the railway and photographic press of repressive action being taken against innocent amateur photographers.<br>  <br>  The only point I would make is that railway stations are private property and staff do have the right to ask people to leave -  do I assume from what you have said before  that you had alighted from a train and had  finished your journey<br>  <br>  As to the amount of compensation, I would ask for ￡5000 and negotiate downwards, if Southeastern are prepared to come to some kind of settlement|`|Y3J5t7Gtaa	Hi,<br>  There is no limit for the compensation you can demand.

8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	Any aftermarket cam should give you a good boost in power, it really depends how you want to drive the car. Look at the RPM range of the cam. For a street car, look for a cam that can perform from 1500-5500rpm. I would probably go with an E303 or an X303 for street use. The F303 may be a little aggressive for a street car. Careful with the X303 though, you may need to check for valve clearance.

AA10137828	That "cage of sorts" is called a tulip joint. It can come apart. If left alone a bad CV joint can break and at the best strand you on the road. At the worst it can cause vehicle damage and/or a wreck.<br>  <br>  Have the offending axle replaced, and consider doing them both.<br>  <br>  EDIT>>>>> <br>  <br>  CV is short for Constant Velocity. This means these joints will deliver constant velocity (speed) at any angle.|`|56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	The CV joints should only be making noise when turning corners under power. You will hear a knock, knock, knock noise. The noise should not be there when going straight down the road. CV joints have 6 steel balls that are in a cage spacing them equally. When a CV joint totally fails, the axle will just spin freely inside the CV joint and the car won't move at all. I'd get a second opinion and estimate. It is cheaper buying after market complete axle assemblies than just replacing the CV joints and boots.|`|fO5JWKMlaa	they are CV joints.  because one side of the joint is a C bracket, the other is a V bracket.  and they arent in a cage.  they are enclosed by a boot.  more than likely they are just dry.  you can either cut the boot off.  clean them up with some water and then solvent, replace the boot and fill the inside of the boot up with grease.<br>  <br>  or you can replace them. which means replacing the whole axle.  you cant replace just the cv joints.<br>  <br>  its up to you. is it dangerous?  could be, it probably would take years for the wear and tear to break them down.|`|dxdvdgFiaa	It could mess up the alignment in your vehicle and wear out the tires even faster than usual.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	yes you should be concerned because they will get worse. the boots tear and all the grease runs out and after awhile the joint get,s dirt in it and goes bad.|`|c48nm70gaa	Your advise is correct. Constant Velocity Joints (CV Joints) are indeed in a cage. It's a total different story *if the rubber bellows boots surrounding the joints are ripped open so the grease can escape. If that's the case plan on getting them fixed ASAP. By the way, it's a lot less expensive to have the entire half shafts replaced than messing around with one or two bad CV joints. A half shaft consists of a re-manufactured axle and a re-built CV joint on each end of the axle.<br>  <br>  I just priced 1 individual new CV joint for your car: $297.00 OUCH. A re-manufactured half shaft is less than $100.00. <br>  <br>  If you go to: autopartswarehouse.com, partstrain.com or rockauto.com under suspension parts, look at an axle assembly. That's called a half shaft. Any local auto parts store has them also. Stay away from your local over priced Honda dealer for these parts.

If not already done you might want to perform a compression test on the cylinders along with a leak down test to ensure the valves are sealing properly.  A tune-up might be needed (plugs, wires etc.).  The fuel injectors may need a purge or replacing.<br>  <br>  The economic state of the World and North America is not that strong.  Putting yourself into debt this day and age is not something I would recommend.  Your Malibu won't bring in a lot of money due to it's age and mileage.  You are looking at payments of $450 a month for the Hyundai.  Plenty of repairs and many litres of fuel can be put into your vehicle for that price.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you keep your Malibu, take the $450 a month and invest it with a financial advisor.  This will allow you to do 2 things.  First you'll beable to find out if you can afford the $450 a month payments and still live comfortably.  If you can not then the money is there at your finger tips to take out instead of being stuck in a car loan.  Second you will beable to build up some equity towards another vehicle and maybe purchase something a little newer.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to by the Hyundai do some research into the warranty.  Not all warranties to 100,000 miles is as good as they sound.  Find out what company the warranty is through.  Find out is it is "Factory Warranty" or an "Extended Warranty Plan".  Find out if there is a deductible for using the warranty.  Find out what the warranty covers on the vehicle.  Finally find out if the warranty is transferable from owner to owner before purchasing.<br>  <br>  Like I said earlier, this is only my opinion and maybe not the best one.  I worked for General Motors for 8 years in the service dept.  Malibu is a very good car with little problems.  I also dealt with many different warranty companies and the best ones are the "Dealer Warranties".  I hope this gives you some insight and helps your decision.  Also remember that deals on vehicles will always be there whether it is now or a year from now.  Good luck!|`|NqWl2qlPaa	Hyundai has a tendency to break down, we suggest if you ae bored with your car try to sell it then buy a new one with that money, but I would say if you have a car that gets you from point a to point b without breaking down,then you need to be happy that you are getting around.  Why take the chance? What if this new car ives you problems, what if you really can't afford the extra expense.  if you want a new car eventually put the 450 you would be spending into a bank account and save it for a newer car in the future, that will reduce your monthly payment when you do buy a car because you will have a bigger down payment.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Im not sure how good hyundai is. I think they have improved but at one time I bought a 2000 Hyundai accent and it was a lemon. Lots of problems. I would buy a brand new honda or a toyota if you are going to spend 450 a month. They will certainly have fewer problems than a Hyundai. But, I only really buy Canadian/American made vehicles now because it helps the economy.|`|AA11435704	The best way to look at this situation is to consider the monthly cost of use of both cars. Your current car is paid off, so you have no payment. Repairs and maintenance costs will be higher as the car ages. <br>  <br>  The Hyundai is a newer car, with a warranty. The repair and maintenance costs will be lower, but you will have a car payment and insurance increase of $450 per month.  This is $5400 per year<br>  <br>  Even if you need to spend money on repairing the Chevy, it is not going to cost you anywhere near $5400 a year.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would keep the car that I have, and put the $450 per month into a savings account to have money for repairs and future replacement of the vehicle

I have had cars that the drain holes at the bottom or the rear quarter panels were stoped up with  dirt. Use a small standard screw driver to clean them out. A good tailtale is that there is small wet spot on the drive way below where the drains are located.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	how's the wheather stripping along ur windows to the door.

AA12239227	You're adding about 500 lbs. with the Subaru 3.0 Flat 6 with AWD.  The engine block itself adds a couple hundred pounds, while the additional transfer case to work the AWD system adds another hundred or so.  You'll also need larger crankshaft and drive shaft to get it all to link up together.<br>  <br>  Check out more answers about this and more at <a href="http://experts123.com" rel="nofollow">http://experts123.com</a>|`|4biGrjPkaa	I'm not sure anyone can give you an exactly accurate answer without dismantling both cars and weighing the actual components, but from the mass of both vehicles - 1225kg for the toyota and 1590kg for the Subaru - there's a difference of 365kg. <br>  <br>  I know there will be a difference in body weight to factor into this too so my guess would be that the Subaru set up is approx 300kg heavier.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry mate, I'm not stripping down my Subaru to answer this . . . !|`|6cGjvZ6Raa	try these places
BIwZ7klfaa	if smoke came out of the steering column then you probably have a couple of wires shorted together, and they probably caused a fuse to open.

hUnuxK3taa	Did you "burp" the radiator system?? if every morning you check your coolant reservour bottle tank low that means because theres air in the system. so you have to burp the system meaning that you have to let it run to get all the air bubbles out. and the white smoke blowing out til it gets warm.. that could be because your engine is cold in the mornings that once it gets warm it stops blowing white smoke... does that happens only in the morning or also through out the day??|`|WXDyS90Naa	Is it smoke, steam or fuel vapor? These are important questions you must answer before you can be given a definitive answer. Sounds like fuel vapor and could be caused by a multitude of things which will require an in-depth diagnosis. as for losing coolant, I highly recommend finding the source and repair it. Engines are expensive! Best of luck to you.    <br>  Mike.

Automatic cars are very restrictive, expensive and you get very poor MPG. They just never seem to be in the right gear. You will find it much more immersive to drive a manual, which will give you greater car control as you gain experience.

Its not the same for every Lincoln so you need the instructions for a LS.  You will need to know your code for the door usually that is a sticker in the trunk or glovebox sometime under the hood or if you had the original papers its in with your owners manual or last result is pay the dealer to get you the code.  You can't reprogram a new number you  can program additional numbers if you have the original number to start with.

If you truly want SQ, you should be looking at a head unit with high voltage preouts...I'd say minimum 4.0v.

However, one thing that I disagree with Patrick on is that Hifonics amps are only for loud setups.  New hifonics, this is correct.  However, the old school Zed built hifonics amps are still solid and could be used in a SQ setup.|`|gQYSRUzLaa	well just for cruising i wouldn't spend that much money if you are not going to compete..yes they are very good choices up there but i have a friend who has two 6.5"s in each front door and 4 6x9"s for the mids and a hifonics 4 channel amp running all of them and they are too damn loud!! and he's banging 3 15" L7's in the trunk.. so look into hifonics mids and highs!

aEeCCHVlaa	I am not an attorney, so am just offering my opinion.  As her name is on the title too, then she is a co-owner of the car.  Since she refused to sign over the title to you fully, then you can take her to court.  When you do, make sure you have all the necessary documents as proof that you paid all the payments, paid all the insurance, paid for all maintenance work.  If all of that is true, I doubt that she could take the car for hurting the credit report on both of you.  The finance company probably sent the title to you because your name is on the title (even though not first) and according to their records, you were the one making all the payments. You may have to retain an attorney, but from what I have read, there is not much she can do.|`|WKsGpvEIaa	She can't take you to court to take the car unless she is willing to buy your half.  The car is registered in your name, not hers, and you have records of payment for the vehicle.

There are many costs associated with your idea:  complexity, higher cost, lower reliability, etc.  In order for it to ever become mainstream, you'll have to come up with a benefit that outweighs all the costs.

xLZGbS9Yaa	If you refilled with anti-freeze, drain it into a container and contact a local garage or dealership to find out where to legally dispose of it. Dumping it down the drain or pouring it into the woods will cause environmental damage somewhere down the line. Anti-freeze is toxic to animals.<br>  Flush the system before removing anything. Do yourself a favor and inspect the radiator and heater hoses for wear damage. This would be a really good time to change them out! Also, don't re-use your old hose clamps, spring for new.<br>  <br>  Start by removing the hoses and transmission cooler lines (if this has an automatic). Plug the tranny lines and catch any fluid that drains from the cooler. Then, remove the cooling fan and fan shroud. Usually, the shroud bolts are all that holds the radiator down into its groove. You should be able to lift it out, now. Be careful not to lose the rubber mounts! Replacement is in the opposite order. Remember to fill the cooling system with at least a 50/50 mix, no more than a 70/30 mix. And, in case of an automatic transmission, be sure to top off the fluid level.

Yes, you should have been not so close, but at the speed mentioned I wouldn't expect there to be any damage since after slowing down over the 2mtr distance the actual velocity on impact must surely have been around 0.5mph, so what is an insurance cover going to pay for.... moving the air, or even worse, making her fart from her mouth?<br>  <br>  It's a petty squabble and you should just forget about it.

AA11435704	What you are doing is wasting time, and getting the dealer to the point where they are going to sell the car to someone else for less just to get rid of you. Have the car checked by your mechanic. Offer the dealer a price you will pay.

So if you make a bad decision, you're pretty much stuck with it. With that said, if you take too long, there is a possibility that the car may be sold to someone else. What you need to do is to do your online research, test drive the car, negotiate the price and then have a mechanic come and inspect the vehicle BEFORE you sign any papers. Once the mechanic gives you the "okay", you site down and finalized the numbers. Just remember to avoid the last minute sales pitches. It is also a good idea not to have the gf sitting next to you during negotiations because that can be counterproductive if she's showing impatience and/or disagreeing with you in front of the dealer.

You should take the car to a mechanic you trust and get them to look at it. Dealers are in the game to make money, your only going to get so good a price before the dealer says "this guy isn't worth the trouble, i'll just wait for another customer" If the dealer knows he's got a good price, then he knows someone will buy it for what he's asking. It's not like your the only one looking for a car. Ask if you can take the car for a fwe hours to have a mechanic look at it. If you like the car and you have done your research, Get the car, try to get a slightly better price if you can, but your decision should be made on the sticker price, if it's a good deal, then it's a good deal, if it's not, go elsewhere.|`|iqMPvr7Taa	You need to speed it up.

You did not. They are not liable for any problems because they made no guarantee of condition. You don't mention  how many miles are on the rig, but I expect it is about 150K at least because it is 14 years old. It is a USED vehicle. They will need work and maintenance. If you wanted "no worries" you should have bought new. For the people here saying there is no such thing as "as-is" you are wrong. Some regulations have changed but it is still the responsibility of the buyer to insure the vehicle is suitable and in proper condition for their needs prior to purchase.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	There is no 30-day "law" giving a buyer the right to return any vehicle - new or used.

It's not fraud, because you had ample time before buying the car, to have it inspected by a mechanic. Which you failed to do.<br>  <br>  You could have bought a car with a warranty.

986cb22ea5345480f4375a6cd667102faa	this is not as hard as these knuckle heads make it sound. $10,000? yeah right. <br>  first youll need a swap, the 2.8 sucks, a 3400 or 3500 will be best and swaps in fairly easily.<br>  this guy has over 300hp on a n/a 3500 <a href="http://www.v6z24.com/registry/whitelightning2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.v6z24.com/registry/whitelight...</a> i know its a cavalier but the engine bay is the same as your car. you can also turbo a 3400, a realistic budget is $4000-$5000|`|8zVxYkluaa	300hp out of a FWD 2.8?

That's the short, simple, and accurate answer.<br>  <br>  Right now, your Beretta has less than 100 wheel horsepower. (130 rated at the engine, around 95-99horsepower at the wheels)<br>  <br>  To get to three hundred, you're asking to increase the horsepower by 300%.<br>  <br>  The amount of money it takes to do something like that, will be far greater than just buying something like a Firebird or Camaro, that starts off with 300 horsepower.<br>  <br>  What to look forward to, if you go through with it? An empty wallet, a lot of headache, and ultimately a car that doesn't perform anything like you want it to....and finally, a car you attempt to sell because you're fed up with it, but no one else wants it either.<br>  <br>  You bought a complete POS car. It'd take you easily $10,000 or so, to reach your 300hp goal. And even if you did it, you'd have an ugly little Beretta that no one cares about.

Not the shifter that has Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, but are you talking about the 4x4 lever, correct?<br>  <br>  If it is a full time 4x4, then it has to be in either 4 Hi or 4 Lo for it to move at all. 4 Hi only when driving it on the streets and highways and 4 Lo only when going slow in mud, dirt, ice and snow. If you place it in neutral, it can not go anywhere because you have no gears connected for it to move.<br>  <br>  I sure hope that this may help you in some way.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	It has to be in 4w 2w hi or low to work but it has to be in one of them .

Chances are that the tC may climb on the S2000, depending on the speed. Plus, Toyota put some serious metal on this baby.

abnqs0jQaa	It certainly appears that way. As of right now, Saab has independently filed for the equivalent of chapter 11 in Sweden (I think I got the right chapter) in which they are going to attempt to restructure the terms of their debts. I believe they have submitted paperwork, and have had an official assigned to work with them on this.<br>  <br>  GM has basically stated that they will give Saab something in the realm of US$450 billion to see them through The end of 2009. If no buyer is found by this time, then the company moves into an independent state I believe. The whole process is going to be immensely complex, as there are overlapping processes and materials with other GM brands. In the meantime, GM will look to secure a buyer, to alleviate some of their monetary issues, as receiving any cash will be better than receiving none at all.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing some party will step up, perhaps a Chinese manufacturer even (As much as I would not like to see that), especially one that is looking to internationalize their own products more, perhaps using Saab as a stepping stone in reaching the US market, even though sales have plunged here. Personally, I'd like to see an independent manufacturer again, but survival would be difficult, especially just prior to launching the new version of the 9-5, and the 9-3x and 9-4x towards year's end, and all the associated sunk cost that go with new models.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Don't confuse GM wanting to sell Saab with Saab going under.

hcGUKAYFaa	Apparently, there are no Volkswagen Mechanics answering your question!<br>  there is a way to add fluid, and no there is no "Dipstick"<br>  it is very important that you only use the fluid from your VW dealer, as the wrong fluid will kill the transmission.<br>  if you are standing in front of the car with the hood up, on the side of the transmission, closest too you.  look down toward the bottom, you will see a small black tube with a little cap on it (originally it would have a red safety lock on it, but yours may well be missing)  this is the fill tube.<br>  there is a catch!  the only way to accurately check the level is with Vag-com, or a volkswagen scan tool.  The trans fluid temperature is supposed to be 38 degrees C when you verify the level.  The process is that you start the car (in Park) and then remove the small drain plug on the bottom of the pan (a 5mm allen key)(dont worry, fluid is not meant to come out unless it is overfilled), you are then meant to add fluid through the fill tube until it starts to come out of that hole, let the transmission warm up to 38 degrees, and make sure it has stopped dribbling out, and then put the screw back in.  if you dont happen to have a scan tool to check the temperature of the transmission fluid, you can ball park it at about 5-10 minutes of run time from a cold start, this will get you close enough.|`|EmgiGg17aa	It is only absurd if you can't accept new technology.   Sealed means it does not leak.  Never seen that, huh?   Wow, support your oil company.<br>     Also,  if there is a transmission dip stick...which you check while the engine is idling in park.

1fuOnSFNaa	I found a 1987 Honda Accord LXi 2 Door Hatchback with 118,715 miles selling for $4,990 in Champaign, IL and a 1986 Honda Accord DX Sedan with 108,514 miles for $3,995 in Dundalk, MD. Of course these are from dealers, but hopefully this will give, somewhat of an idea.

Simply take that value, reduce it by about 20%, as cars generally lose around 10% each year, and you'll be close to your value.<br>  <br>  You didn't specify model, whether it's 2 door, 4 door etc.<br>  <br>  "extra low miles" sounds retarded, I'm not even going to ask.<br>  <br>  But, for an average Honda Accord, around $1000.

Pay a mechanic to check out the car,do not waste money on a junker without doing that, all cars that price are junkers ok. Make people show you reciepts for major repairs, everyone keeps those reciepts so anyone who doesnt have them, is lying or didnt take care of the car. Ask how many owners, do one of those reports you pay for too. Dont buy without a title and bill or sale and all the proper paperwork, in your hand, allow noone to mail you something. I have been ripped off more than once. Look at the blue book values for cars your considering, and get quotes on ins for such cars, there can be huge price differences in simple things are the model type etc etc. It is well worth taking your time, and then start saving big time, the car might fail in teh first six months, or even two months so be prepared.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Chevrolet Malibu is probably the best you can do, and the highway miles will be somewhere between 26 to 30 mpg if in tune and you keep your foot out of it.

They used to have great quality but that's not true anymore and Honda just blows them away for quality, fun, MPG, and appearance.  I used to rent Camry's and Corolla's for business trips but they have gotten so bad lately, (and one Camry stranded me out in the middle of PA with a dead transmission), that I gave up and went totally to Honda.  The last Corolla I rented, (an 07), was one of the blandest, uninteresting cars I have ever driven and I was thrilled to turn it back in to the rental agency.|`|zruhNGKbaa	Boring?  I suppose any vehicle can be from a certain perspective - but then I always was under the impression that cars are built to a purpose ... and that purpose is to provide a basic and utilitarian requirement for transportation of a person or a group of people and their purpose is not to entertain - except in the limited area of motor racing so I fail to see the reasoning behind your question... <br>  <br>  Based on the number of Toyota's and Lexus's sold every year they seem to be meeting quite a few peoples concept of a good vehicle.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	I drive a Lexus, 300+ horse power, RWD.

AA11435704	It will depend on the amount of work that is involved in checking out the problem. If you want a shop to look at your tires or check your headlights, they may do it for free. If you want a mechanic to spend time and effort in diagnosing a major problem, you have to pay for that time and effort. <br>  <br>  Most mechanics work on flat rate, which means that they are paid per job. They are not paid an hourly wage or salary.  A good rule is if the mechanic has to put the car on the lift or open his tool box, he will want to be paid. When you go to work, you expect to be paid, the mechanic expects the same.<br>  <br>  Many shops will not charge you the check out fee if you have the repairs done by them.  Some shops will offer a free brake or exhaust inspection, and some auto parts stores will do a free reading of any computer codes. You do not say what type of problem you are having, but most likely you will have to pay to have it checked.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	a lot of places will take the time to look at it and tell you what,s wrong but the thing is, can you believe them? some places will tell you anything just to get the work and your money.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Some places I've had it done for free, some charge upwards of $100. <br>  My best advice would be to call around, or if you have a place in mind that you would want to fix it once it's been looked at, call them ask for an inspection. They will ask what's going on with the car, and normally tell you to bring it in to them. <br>  Most good places though will do it for nothing, in hopes of getting the real business from you.|`|AA10137828	Can you go to the doctor and have your tonsils looked at for free?<br>  <br>  <br>  Shops are in business to make money. Mechanics have families, mortgages, and bills to pay as well as anyone else. I will usually "look at" my regular customers problems at no charge because I know they will eventually allow me to do the repairs that may be needed.<br>  <br>  If someone "off the streets" comes in and wants me to spend a half hour or more of my time to diagnose their car problems (so they will know what to fix themselves) I will, but at the $65.00 an hour shop rate.<br>  <br>  Shops that use "Service Advisors" (which is a joke) will look for free, but those guys usually aren't mechanics and most get paid based on the repairs they sell.|`|b0d24bddcaaa43ed3a96f65bad4ed681aa	HI, That is a good idea.Some shops will look the car over for a small fee or none at all .

2VVU7gNfaa	Whovever rebuilt it should have had some sort of guarantee or warranty for the work that should cover at least 18 days worth of driving!  Check the paperwork to see how long a guarantee they have on their parts/labor etc., because even the cheapest shops usally give some sort of guarantee of work.<br>  <br>  Take it back to the shop that rebuilt it and have them fix whatever's wrong.  They should cover the cost of doing so - if they don't, take it to a different shop or just junk the car and get a different one at this point.<br>  <br>  EDIT - It went back out because whoever rebuilt it did something wrong either in reassembly (sounds like it wasn't sealed back up properly) or used inferior parts etc.,  The good thing about warranties is that it doesn't matter why it broke again - all that matters is that you don't have to pay to fix it.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Fords transmissions are the worst in the business.

(see picture in link). The writer jokes that Microsoft must have invented a special flying car because part of the routing took the car over open water.<br>  <a href="http://regmedia.co.uk/2005/01/24/microsoft_flying_car.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://regmedia.co.uk/2005/01/24/microso...</a><br>  <br>  10 REASONS WHY MICROSOFT DOESN'T BUILD FLYING CARS<br>  <br>  1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br>  <br>  2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.<br>  <br>  3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.<br>  <br>  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.<br>  <br>  5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive, but would run on only five percent of the roads.<br>  <br>  6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning light.<br>  <br>  7. The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.<br>  <br>  8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.<br>  <br>  9. Every time a new car was introduced, car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again, because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.<br>  <br>  10. Oh yeah, and last but not least . . . you'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off!

dyIyJqauaa	You need to contact your own insurance company and let them do the work you "hired" them to do.    This is a perfect example of what happens when you try to"settle on your own".  Never, ever try to "settle on your own"|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Next time be sure to call the police and have them file a report, regardless of whether the other person wants to or not (especially if there's even a small chance that the accident wasn't your fault).   Live and learn.<br>  <br>  I'd keep hounding his insurance agent (like several times daily) until you get some sort of response from them either way, but there's a good chance the other person will just deny everything at this point.  It would help if you had a witness to the accident (if there was one besides you and the other person...) but with no witness, no police report, and if the other driver denies hitting you you might get stuck paying for the damages yourself unless you take him/her to small claims court.<br>  <br>  In small claims court you'll have to prove that you were hit by the other person somehow etc., and it might end up being another case of your word vs. theirs.  It's up to the judge at that point.  If there was any paint transfer (or if you can somehow get a picture of the damage to their car) that's a good place to start to support your case.  Good luck.

VEIkVDtIaa	there are about 5 small coolant hoses that run in the back of the engine under the intake manifold.  the probablility is that one of them is leaking.  <br>  <br>  almost everyone recommends replacing all of the hoses at the same time because they are a pain in the neck to get to.  plus, if one is leaking then the others will follow shortly so its more economical to replace all of the hoses at the same time.<br>  <br>  you will have to get under the car and use a flashlight to look up to see where the leak is coming from.<br>  <br>  its not a coolant jug or a cracked block.  the leaking hoses are extremely common on the older accords.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|986cb22ea5345480f4375a6cd667102faa	see if you can find exactly where its leaking. the heater core is at the back so one of the hoses could have a hole or bad clamp, cheap fix.|`|NCPmNw4Eaa	Your coolant tank is probably busted. It has happened to my car, if it is that then you will have to go to your local Honda dealer and they can order you a new one and replace it. A coolant tank for my 2005 Lincoln LS was $165. I put it in myself so it didn't cost any labor. I would imagine a tank would be a lot less for your Honda. Also I would check to make sure you do not have a sticky thermostat. That can cause your engine to run hot! <br>  :) Sarah|`|Yy5EgaKhaa	You probably just need new hoses cause it your suppose to replace hoses about every 35K to 60K and it's only like 120 bucks to replace them all.|`|6Zflv6cpaa	if the leak isn't close to the hoses,you may have a cracked block ,a leaking freeze plug,or a blown head gasket.

With the near match paint, you can't really tell the difference unless you look at it closely.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	How old is the car?  If its older then a couple years the original code is useless because the paint fades over time so you have to match the paint as it is now.|`|tt9bwlg5aa	Your best bet is to take a small paint chip from the car into a dealership to have it analyzed.

SOfbIOzUaa	The question is not if it is worth it or not but rather is it worth it to you? Most would no doubt simply use good all-weather tires. If you have done that already and feel that more is needed, well, you have to decide if it is worth it to you. If you drive with a tire that is only rated for summer use then yes, you should have special tires for winter.|`|nQ1LlJ6yaa	why would you put snow tires on a car the only reason i would is if i am constrantly driving in the snow
Yq2CUhtYaa	Sell it, and buy one with the engine in it that you want.<br>  <br>  Seriously, sit down and do the math.<br>  <br>  Lets say you get an LS1 engine, at the low low price of around 5,000-6000. Then you figure installation costs, which will be another 2-3,0000.<br>  <br>  So, you're at $7000, for a stock LS1 engine, when you could buy a 2000 Trans Am, with that engine, for around 7,000 to start with. And not have to worry that it was installed properly.|`|zruhNGKbaa	Physically - with a LOT of money and a lot of work you can shoehorn a small block V-8 in there.  It will require an entire donor vehicle - A Pontiac, Buick or Oldsmobile will serve. the reason for the entire donor vehicle is because you will need all of the wiring and engine controls.  <br>  <br>  If you intend to register the vehicle in a Tailpipe Test state the donor vehicle must be the same year or newer to meet the tail pipe emission requirements. <br>  <br>  You will get far more bang for your buck by rebuilding the existing engine using performance components.|`|P1J8Tg8Qaa	You can put in whatever engine you want but it's going to take some serious modifications, money, and time. I believe the LS1 motor would be the biggest "bolt in" motor you can throw in there. but unless you already have one and are going to do the work yourself, you'd be better off selling your V6 car and buying a V8 car. there are plenty of websites out there for your car though. do a little reading and figure out what way is the best way for you.|`|e34ec130ff0f1fd7cdba13b91612b6aeaa	ls1, lt1, and lt4 are all 350 v8s that they put in the trans ams. the lt1 is the standard 350, the ls1 in the newer 350, and the lt4 is the corvette 350.<br>  <br>  good luck

qjg0g5WMaa	well it depends on how long you drove it like this usually on your particular car there is a plastic bushing at the throttle for the tv cable that  falls apart and causes this but if you have been driving it while its doing this then you have a "clutched"trans which requires replacement or rebvuild it could also be a modulator you can buy a used trans for $250-$450 and pay someone to change it<br>  good luck|`|xj9NY7xDaa	I think its time to get ride of you car as reconditioned gear box costs more than the car

AA12261615	you,ll maybe notice a slight difference in the way it runs,over running 91 or 93 octane in it but not that much,the most difference will be in the price of it,i tried it in my neon because it was free to try and it didn't help it none at all,it burns hotter is about all,good luck.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You stand a good chance of trashing it.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Probably not much of anything except you'll pay more for the fuel.<br>  <br>  The engine is designed to run on "premium" fuel (91+ octane).  Running it on 100 octane fuel won't do much of anything to increase power etc., because the ECU and the engine aren't set up to take advantage of the greater knock resistance of the 100 octane fuel over "premium" 91 octane pump gas.  All "octane level" signifies is how resistant the fuel is to knock - it doesn't mean that the fuel burns "more powerfully" or anything like that.<br>  <br>  As far as the engine being damaged in any way, that's just not true.  As long as the fuel is unleaded (which it is), no damage will be done to the motor running it on higher octane fuel - just don't expect any big power gain from running it on 100 octane fuel either unless you modify the engine and ECU to take advantage of the greater knock resistance..|`|OtDPZO3vaa	The 100 octane won't cause ANY problems with the car. I'm not sure why you'd want to use the pricey fuel. It will fire only as well as 91 octane.<br>  The SRT already has a high energy ignition so going to 100 octane won't run any differently.<br>  Stay away from 87 octane due to colder burns and carboning of your plugs.|`|VItj8zdAaa	nothing will happen.  your engine sure won't ping!!!!  that's all octane is for, detonation suppression|`|qeLikL8Haa	it wont run right or last as long|`|AA10957016	It is not going to hurt but waste your money.

Make sure you use one the right length, not too long or too short. <br>  <br>  A helicoil in an aluminium head - such as a spark plug - will not fail if the procedure is done correctly, and the right thread lock is used.  It is best to remove the head, but with a lot of grease and care you might get away with doing it in place without swarf getting into the combustion chamber - but it's much more painful than just taking the head off and buying a couple of gaskets.  Then an issue is getting the grease and metal chips out of the new thread so the thread lock can do it's thing, again difficult with the head in place.<br>  <br>  Helicoils can fail if the ham fisted grossly over tighten the bolt or plug. Of course that is probably why the thread failed in the first place. There is an acceptable torque for every fastener - not just as hard as possible every time.  <br>  <br>  Happy helicoiling :)|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Most times a tap for the size striped is supplied then install the coil> If a spark plug in aluminum most time it will not hold for long as when you remove the plug it brings the coil with it> he direction are with the coils if not search by the manufacture and see what the say for installing>|`|3adsDss7aa	what are you trying to put a heli coil in?
LVPNuEsLaa	With the economy the way it is, they will probably pick up your car for you - having it on their lot helps to ensure that you buy from them, and if you do not you will probably still get it fixed there at least.<br>  <br>  Before they buy it they will have a mechanic inspect it and deduct a probable repair cost from the trade-in value.  Unless you are bringing it in on one of those "Guaranteed $2000 for your trade" deals, in which case they are already assuming your car is trash.  They will also deduct the cost of the tow, as they almost certainly do not own a tow truck.<br>  <br>  Of course, all of this is assuming you are buying a car yourself, which you did not explicitly mention.

IC9gvmJ1aa	Paper and tape has a lower flamability rate than tin foil, which I've seen people do a lot. Those wires tend to get warm, so I recommend using black electrical tape and going to an audio shop and getting wire clips. You twist them on the ends of the wires and then you're good.|`|gstBWswfaa	lol go get some elect tape... your gonna start a fire|`|4b4d4f3bfe33461a02daa163629ada22aa	Wrapping paper is not so good. Electrical tape is much better for wrapping wires.  Best is to install coax connectors on each bare wire. The under dash equipment can get very hot in summer heat, so best be prepared for the worst; protect audio, stereo, and video wires with connectors designed for that purpose.|`|tLilNlptaa	Always use electrical tape, it is specifically designed to electrical wires and connectors.

zlPAVkUBaa	Tell the flight manager you'll be available to fly when you see a 25% increase.<br>  <br>  You'll get answers.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	umm.................. go to a main airline|`|aafTqjV1aa	Well, if you chat with the owner each time you fly for a little while, he might become a little less scary, and eventually you can ask him. "Hey, who do I need to talk to around here to get a raise?" and see what his reaction is. If he's grumpy, just drop it and stay as  friendly with him as you can. You might want to be fully prepared, however, because he might just say "ME! - Let's talk after the flight!" and then you don't want to be fumbling around.  Work your justifications  out and put them on a card you can quickly review. This is stuff you should be thinking about and writing down on those long, boring legs to nowhere.  Don't mention your wife can no longer work. Focus ONLY on the things you do for HIS flight department, such as covering the overtime shifts, relocation flights, etc. It's stuff he may not even be aware you do. Do you wind up flying Christmas Eve, bringing the kids home from college? Do you oversee the maintenance on the aircraft? If so, you should be making more than the other captain, even if you are a first officer. Mechanics and flight personnel rolled into one are naturally more valuable.<br>  <br>  The second thing you should do is, find out who your flight manager's boss is. There has to be someone who authorizes the money. You may have to dig on this one, but there has to be someone in charge. If your flight manager doesn't know, keep going upstream until you find someone who's responsible. You can approach them about a raise in a formal letter. Again, outline all the things you do to justify it. Remember, everyone needs something to cover their ***, and it should be businesslike. Leave out the wife and newborn. This owner made his money through business, and that is how the whole thing should be approached. You want to give the manager you  approach a solid reason to be handing you more money. "Of course I had to give him a raise!. Look at all the stuff he does!"                                  <br>  Thirdly, maybe update your resume. If this job is headed nowhere, it might be time to find another jet owner who is a little more appreciative of a good crew. Never mention this to anyone in your company. It's none of their business, and if they are so interested, why didn't THEY<br>  see that you got a raise? It may get to the point of an ultimatum, but then you MUST be ready to leave if they say "No", so that is a last resort. If it falls short of that, but there also is no raise, then work on getting as much flight time as you can, so you yourself become more valuable as a crew-member. The reason they had to bring in the other captain is probably insurance requirements about crew hours,  so build up your time so that is no longer an issue. <br>  Good Luck.

qjg0g5WMaa	change your air filter<br>  hope this helps|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	If your in 5th gear doing this, that is the worst gear to try and accelerate in.  As this gear is an overdrive gear.  Might help to downshift one or two gears to get the rpm's up, and be able to accelerate quicker.|`|r9H8AXIsaa	Check your Throttle Position Sensor (TPS).<br>  <br>  The TPS signals wide open throttle to the EEC, this states that the driver doesn?t care about economy or emissions and want maximum power to the rear wheels. Fuel enriches to a preset level even further the colder the ACT is. The timing jumps up to a maximum preset level around 28 BTDC.  The throttle air bypass remains at 100% giving you a larger throttle inlet and as a back up incase the throttle slams shut. All EGR functions are stopped and the canister purge valve is closed to ensure the exact air to fuel ratios desired.|`|xj9NY7xDaa	I was told this some time ago  on manual gear box that tork on gear box allows you go up the Gears the right way if the power from engine   was faster than the gear box  you would strip the cogs  I hope this helps  you|`|6Zflv6cpaa	with a small engine and a manual trans.,you're not going to get a lot of acceleration unless you downshift to a lower gear.|`|wExMzXxJaa	have you tuned it up fuel filter plugs etc.  if so it could be in the carburetor,throttle body,E.F.I what ever you have. or maybe the thing needs some kind of Sensor or rebuilt! new rings and things!!!!!!|`|lsjMmZuiaa	obstructed fuel line maybe?  The engine could be getting enough fuel to cruise, but not enough to accelerate quickly.<br>  <br>  what happens if you rev it in neutral?<br>  <br>  other things to check into would be fuel injection system, and maybe even mass airflow sensor...
PHdsOPwIaa	I'm on my 3rd Saturn and have been pleased with all 3. <br>  My first was a 99 SL, base model...I needed cheap, they had exactly what I needed. It was reliable. Got rear ended and only a little tear in the bumper cover, it got fixed and then turned in at the lease end. <br>  Gotta 02 Vue, loved it - being a first year car, it had minor issues but it was a good car. It gave it's life in a rear ending (I was stopped, got hit by a Dodge Ram 1500 coming at me at 35mph, driver distracted.) we walked out. Took my money and got an 07 Vue with the Honda powertrain, love it to pieces.<br>  My dealer, Santa Ana, has never sold me something I don't need. I know my car and what's going on with it. My 07 hasn't even been back to the dealer since i got it 2 yrs ago. I've only done the oil and kept it clean. <br>  Wind noise on a plastic body car is louder than a steel body, but lighter weight means better fuel economy. <br>  It's a cheap, safe car. Mine's been reliable. Others have different experiences.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	They should have said its an SL2 and not a plain SL.  <br> <br> Anyway, the Saturn S-Series can be a reliable car, but only if you know how to take care of a Saturn.  Change oil at 3k, keep EGR valve clean, keep throttle body clean, replace ECTS with brass tipped unit if it hasn't been replaced already, replace timing chain accordingly, and so on.<br> <br> You gotta do more than what the manual says to keep them running right.  Because of this, these cars are best suited for people who work on their own cars.  I've found that a lot of mechanics get stumped and dumbfounded when problems occur.  Remember their slogan "A Different Kind of Company, A Different Kind of Car"?  Take that literally.  Saturn Dealers try to rip you off with things you don't even need (not all, but a lot of them do).  <br> <br> Those are pretty low miles though, even though its 10 years old.  If you know for a fact the car has been well-maintained and you know a shop that knows Saturns, then go for it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't take a chance.         <br> <br> If you decide to get it, I highly recommend joining www.saturnfans.com.  This is the best resource you have if you ever have problems with your Saturn.  These members KNOW THIS BRAND WELL.|`|xuenoIO7aa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

This is by Focus and can be purchased in most good shops. It has lots of clips for the hazard perception and tests you just like the real thing.<br>  <br>  It can help with the written part of the test and driving lessons too. You can even download some to your Ipod!<br>  <br>  Just remember the golden rules when taking your hazard perception test and click the mouse on the following;<br>  <br>  1. POTENTIAL HAZARD for example when you see a pedestrian walking along the pavement.<br>  <br>  2. DEVELOPING HAZARD for example the pedestrian has now changed course and is walking towards the road.<br>  <br>  3. ACTUAL HAZARD for example when the pedestrian actually steps into the road.<br>  <br>  Have a good practise first but watch out for clicking to often as it will wipe your mark out. Should you find this happening then miss out the potential hazard clicks<br>  <br>  Make sure you practise and it will be fine, good luck with your driving too.|`|hktbfRPWaa	I found the books most useful.

mwu6aJuyaa	It depends on the price of your car really. If you have a ferrari, well then collision and repairs will be alot. if you have a civic... not such a big deal.<br>  Lets just say you have a civic or something comparable for price. Your rates will probably change by like, 10 bucks. The damages to the car are not an insurance companies biggest worry. It's the lawsuit from personal injuries that cost the big bucks. these can run into the millions if you cause someone serious long term injuries. (or kill someone) so liability is always the brunt of your premium payments. If your going to drop collision, ask yourself if you could afford to just walk away from the car if you got in an accident. because that might be what your forced to do in the case that you got into a bad enough accident that it was a writeoff.|`|oReGA5kEaa	Collision coverage is easily the most expensive coverage on an average policy. By dropping it, you should see a big drop in your premium. As to exactly how much, that depends on your carrier, prior driving history, what you are currently paying, and your current coverages. Call your insurance agent and ask.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The price also varies depending on the car (some have higher accident rates than others).  What you really want to know if the difference between the cost of full coverage on your current car and the cost of liability only on the car that you intend to obtain.  This may be more or less than the difference between the cost of full coverage and liability coverage on the same car, depending on which car is more or less expensive to insure.
84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	There is no such thing as an international driver licence.  There is an IDP, international driver permit, which is a multi-lingual translation of the home driver licence, and is only valid when presented along with the original licence.  It doesn't certify anybody as a licenced driver because it is issued without a test.<br>  An experienced or well-trained novice should be able to drive in unfamiliar territory just as well as in familiar territory, albeit slightly more watchful.<br>  Other than that, I can't be of much help.

I would scoff at that claim too.  An IDL means he can drive left hand, right hand, and recognizes all the road signs.  Seems there is some BS here.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Don't chit-chat with the inspector at all.  Do only whatever he/she asks and focus soley on obeying the traffic laws.  Your husband doesn't have to go have a beer with the inspector after the test - he just needs to do what the inspector asks and obey all traffic laws.  The inspector won't fail someone if they do everything correctly, even if he/she doesn't "like" them for some reason.    <br>  <br>  Practice whatever skill(s) that made him fail the test last time around and take the test somewhere else (or with a different inspector) if possible to avoid the jerk the next time around if the inspector's "attitude" bugged your husband that much.
MGHTJx0Waa	If your car is in good order and have good tyres the 40mph|`|URZNtrxsaa	Depending on where you live, there is one additional qualifying factor. Here is AZ., we can go 180 days without rain. The build up of oil on the roadways and what occurs when that first rain, shower or otherwise, hits the pavement, is sorta like being in Chicago for the first snowfall.....|`|nAK8bm91aa	25-30|`|TdrgZwnoaa	As long as there is no '''standing water''' on the road and one has good tires inflated to the proper pressure there is no reason why you can't travel at 45 MPH.<br>   If there is standing water or a stream running across the road you may want to proceed at a slower rate of speed.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Whenever the conditions change to rainy, you want to decrease your speed by at least 10-15 mph.  So that would mean going 30-35 mph to ensure that you do not slide, or hydroplane.  When it first rains there is a presence of oil on the roads meaning more chances of sliding and losing traction.  So decrease your speed by 15 mph.|`|AA11914369	The speed limit is what is safe under ideal conditions.  The prima facie, or reasonable speed after a shower would depend on a variety of factors from the surface of the road to the amount of rain.  The FIRST rain after a long dry spell tends to bring up more oil that the later showers.<br>  <br>  I suggest slowing to around 30 to start, if it seems stable enough you can increase.  If you are hydroplaning at 30, slow even more.  And remember, under less than ideal conditions, turn the cruise control off.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Totally depends on when the last shower was and the quality of your tires and how straight the road is.  If it is a daily occurance, and you got good tires and the road is straight and there are no intersections, 44.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	About 35-40 mph. Normally, you'll want to drive 5-10 mph slower if the road is wet and more slower for snow. But if the rain is over, then you might be able to go 45.

I7NkFJo2aa	You do not get on a boat unless invited - not unless it's a hot day and you want to swim.  If you get an appointment be on time (you are demonstrating that a boat isn't going to have to wait for you), be ready to pass drug testing on most company owned boats, be persistant, have tickets or at least some introductory certificates like senior first aid etc. and be prepared to continue learning for ever really, be humble even when you do know something - everyone will know your abilities soon enough so don't tell just do.  Listen - don't rabbit on - it gets irritating very quickly in a cabin.  You have to get along with everyone on a boat - even people you would never have anything to do with otherwise, but they have to get along with you too - it is part of the dynamic of shipboard life.  You do not argue with the cook unless you don't like to eat, you do not ever enter the engineer or skippers space without invitation nor do you argue with them and you must work hard and without moaning.<br>  <br>  Getting the job may be difficult, but keeping it and gaining skills and tickets is the whole point - deck work is for the young.<br>  <br>  Never ever lie or embroider the truth.<br>  <br>  Be physically fit and capable - life at sea is pretty brutal and unrelenting.|`|we5DkJVVaa	I agree with the above answer.

qGpD9ntNaa	I am guessing that the monte has a V-6. <br>  I LOVE THE SOUND of a glasspack. The longer the glasspack the deeper the sound. You will want the longest one you can get I would also suggest that you install a set of echo chambers for the  tips.<br>  <br>  And when it comes to glass pack they are all pretty much the same I use the thrush glasspacks just because that is what most part stores carry around here and love the way they sound.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that it is actually a glasspack some places sell turbo mufflers that look kinda like glass packs. The difference is a glasspack is open all the way down the center a muffler has baffles|`|2VVU7gNfaa	The sound varies depending on the car.  Fortunately for you, your Monte Carlo doesn't have a 4-cylinder engine so it won't sound anything like the "rice burner sound" you're trying to avoid no matter which exaust you choose.  V6s sound different than 4 cylinders.<br>  <br>  I would caution you against getting the loudest exhaust possible FWIW - lower revving pushrod V6s don't always sound great with a super loud exhaust either....not like the way a 4 cylinder sounds but bad none the less.|`|0lBwS4QFaa	The glass pack is the one you will want to put on that car.  Cherry Bombs are good, and will give you that deep throaty sound.  Go to their website they have sound clips on there to what it will sounds like. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cherrybomb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cherrybomb.com/</a>|`|NZO3Nr0Baa	They do not sound like a ricer but dont have a deep sound either, kind of sound like a basic straight through design like Magnaflow..... if you want a deep tone you have to use a chambered muffler, like a flowmaster, 40 series.....|`|ECGzxPF5aa	Don't buy cherry bomb. You get what you pay for. Use Magnaflow or Flowmaster. Quality stainless steel construction. I think the Flowmasters are louder.
3wMsOJnmaa	Exhaust installation is pretty straigh forward.

AA11420834	I can tell you that if you are looking at a YJ ('87-'95), 1995 is probably the best year. That year saw multi-port fuel injection and the clutch slave cylinder was moved to the outside of the transmission bell housing for easier replacement. The slave cylinders go bad on YJ's.

lHLDvVALaa	There hasn't been anything said for sure. <br>  <br>  I suspect, however, that the Towncar will stay around for at least as long as the Panther platform is around. The last I heard, Ford is going to keep using the Panther platform until at least 2012, so I expect that it will be around until then. <br>  <br>  Here's why I suspect this:<br>  <br>  A fully loaded Grand Marquis, which is virtually identical feature wise to a base model(Signature) Towncar, has an MSRP of $31,745. The Towncar, which gives you two more inches of wheel base, but not a whole lot else, has a base MSRP of $46,385. <br>  <br>  I've heard it stated that it only costs in the neighborhood of $1000 more for Ford to build a Towncar than a Grand Marquis. If that's true, that means that the profit on the Towncar is in the neighborhood of $14,000 greater than that on the Grand Marquis. <br>  <br>  Besides that, Towncars still sell really well. A lot of taxi companies use them as an upscale version of their standard cabs, which are usually Ford Crown Vics. <br>  <br>  Thus, I don't see the Towncar goin away at least for a few more years.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	It seems so.<br>  <br>  Lincoln has already made that alpahbet car (MKX, MKZ, whaveter...) with a v6 and AWD its falgship car.<br>  <br>  Lincoln is now poised to fight....Buick!<br>  <br>  Yes, that Buick which is taking over China.<br>  <br>  My how the mighty have fallen.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	They should keep it, but I suspect they won't.|`|54660de70991857a4d553a722887d44caa	Ford doesn't know from year to year what they are going to do with the towncar.

zruhNGKbaa	I would not recommend any Jeep or other SUV for an around the town vehicle   <br>  <br>  Your fuel consumption under those driving conditions will be hideous - like 10 to 12 MPG in city driving. <br>  <br>  And if the owner is willing to let it go for that price I suspect that ther are serious mechanical issues with it.   <br>  <br>  What you need to find is a cute (???) little 4 Cylinder economobile with between 80 and 120k on the odometer and be willing to accept some minor dents and scratches - I will choose the car with dents and lower total mileage over the high mileage car with a beautiful body any day -  in the city pretty cars are damage magnets!!!  <br>  <br>  Invest $60 in an inspection before you buy any vehicle - an inspection will save you from buying a vehicle which needs thousands of dollars worth of work to make it safe and reliable.  Expect the car to need some repairs and use the estimate as a bargaining tool.<br>  <br>  What ever you choose - Pay cash. <br>  <br>  The best possible car for you to buy is one that you can pay cash for. Period. It is less expensive to maintain and repair a used vehicle than it is to make payments and pay interest on a new one.  <br>  <br>  And by all means never ever Fleece (Lease) any vehicle for personal use – the actual costs are far higher than that of financing and at the end of the lease you will have nothing – except the likely hood of a massive over mileage charge and excessive wear and damage charges.  <br>  <br>  Even worse than a fleece are the “Buy Here – Pay Here” lots which will give you a nice low weekly payment on a car they are selling for usually twice the fair market value at an interest rate that would make any loan shark smile, on a note that will enslave you for the next 5 years at least on a car which is almost guaranteed to die in 2 years or less! <br>  <br>  It is far more cost effective to purchase and maintain a used vehicle and save the difference for a newer and nicer vehicle a couple of years down the road.  An older vehicle will also save you money in the form of lower insurance costs too! <br>  <br>  Avoid the clutches of the predatory lenders – Buy Cash, Pay Cash. Live Cash and build real wealth.|`|b13e67e09be2c5a888d65427678b9383aa	Depens on what size engine it has the inline 6 or the v-8 as long as you change the oil in them and take care of it it would be a great first car.

The handles in our model car rest in a folded in position that lay somewhat flush with the side roof panels. After grabbing one of them and releasing it, it slowly/quietly retracts - almost like it has hydraulics or something!.. Go figure.<br>  <br>  It's actually nice because depending on how you drive, or how much you get tempted driving your A4, you won't hear the snapping noise that other handles make without this feature when your passengers grab one to hold on for dear life!<br>  <br>  *,...,*<br>  <br>  LOL!|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Its those little handles that you can use to help get in and out of the car. slow retractions is so they dont slap back in place.

A hole of more than 5mm wouldn't be, so it depends on the MoT'er. <br>  I grew out of thinking a louder exhaust made the vehicle somehow faster when i put a Micron on a Yamahe FS1E. It doesn't - it just attracts the plod.
ltY2U7pXaa	There's no timing on those glow plugs... the "Timing" of a 2-stroke engine is based on the porting in the cylinder walls.  All i can think of are the typical gas engine issues, such as making sure you have a good plug, good fuel flow, tight exhaust, not flooded, etc.  Replacing the pullstart should not affect it, unless it's the wrong one and is not gripping to turn the engine over.  But if the engine turns over, then the problems will just be your typical "getting it to run" stuff, unless something didn't get put back together if you pulled the motor out to change pullstarts.
AA10097817	Because you made the phone call to your insurance company, they've already noted on your records, so there's not much you can do as far as your record goes. Been there. Let the insurance company pursue it. Be prepared for your record to follow you to your new location, and whether it was your fault or not doesn't seem to matter anymore.|`|oojO4WAraa	I would file with the insurance company and let them pursue him.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	If the accident is not your fault, the insurance rates will not change. The accident will not have any bearing on your driving record as you were not at fault. I was hit by a school bus, the accident was not my fault. My rates were not affected and my driving record was not tarnished. Go through your insurance, they have the lawyers, let them sue.|`|oReGA5kEaa	If you were not-at-fault for the accident, your rate should not go up. Use your insurance, let them handle this quickly and save yourself the hassle. The good news is the guy has plenty of money, so collecting shouldn't be an issue.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Ask him if he is willing to pay you directly, without being sued.  If he has the money and neither of you wants to spend time on a lawsuit, it seems like the best approach.|`|wqL84O8Naa	if he has "collateral" in the bank, he needs to get his collateral out and pay you. if a citation is issued it is all the proof you need. Your insurance does not need to sue him YOU do. Depending on the amount of the claim, you might be able to settle in small claims court which doesn't take more than 30-60 days generally, if you need to get a lawyer, and he is found to be at fault he'll have to pay those fees as well.<br>  honestly talk to a lawyer
EmgiGg17aa	Then I would go to the cop shop for that info.|`|DM6YyuoJaa	oh everyone in newjersey atleast northern jersey evryone has tinted windows and the cops dont do anything about it so dont sweat it babe youll be fine(:|`|RiQA4Epraa	tintlaws.com
6XIDmojtaa	if money is no option go with the mopar performance 426 hemi and definitely a holley 4500 carb (or dominator)if you want a big motor you don't care about gas and for straight up performance a carb is the only way, unless you want mechanical injection and run it on alcohol?|`|a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	Why ya messing with it? did you actually wear out the 318?|`|N7LlOAcOaa	HEMI>ford,gm,toyota|`|JvxrCb2Paa	Regardless of engine use a carburetor, more top end power.
lVywDjv7aa	chezdot<br>  <br>  just imagine how funny that would be.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	NE146T9
kFsviR9waa	For a girl 100% , I would get shot seen driving in that|`|cr1ivtqvaa	Its a good car for a girl but deffinately not a guy..
Xzdyz8Kiaa	BF Goodrich is the only company that makes mud terrain tires that will last a decent amount of time on the highway.<br>  <br>  They're not the absolute best mud tires, for that you'd have to go with Super Swampers or comparable which would wear out fast on the highway. <br>  <br>  But for on and offroad use, you cannot beat BFG.<br>  <br>  Michelin does not make mud tires, so that suggestion would be best suited for toilet paper. Also, someone mentioned 'run-flats', although unbeknownst to them what they were actually called. You will not get these in a mud terrain either. That suggestion could perhaps be used to remove fecal matter from one's anus as well.|`|0GdlS9a9aa	i don't know if these are the BEST but they do make tires that do not go flat once they need a repair.  That way you can drive to the shop and not be stuck somewhere unsafe or alone trying to fix it : )|`|AA11420834	BF Goodrich All-Terrain. My set lasted a long time on and off road. Quiet on the highway.|`|u1qgyGFNaa	michellin...theyre expensive but theyre hella good|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Mud tires have drag and cost you in gas consumption and tire replacement cost.Keep the tires stock and you will save in the long run.|`|S4soZUFCaa	Prob. any mudder will get brutalized on the highway.
S4soZUFCaa	Prob doesn't have them, Germans want their customers to drive, not sip.|`|6mLhiSXuaa	they didn't include cup holders to save weight, which helps performance..<br>  <br>  JK. drinking anything while driving isn't popular in Germany, or any of Europe for that matter, Up until the last couple years no BMW has had respectable cup holders... My 88 325i doesn't have any, and the ones in my old 328is, and in my current M5 are a joke.|`|XixWPZZsaa	BMW is for driving, not eating or drinking. That's why it doesn't have cup holders - your both hands should be on the wheel at all times in a car like that. Number of cup holders now is often a big factor for average american drivers who could not tell a difference between any two cars, they just need MP3, bluetooth and the car to parallel park itself.|`|a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	The "fantastic German engineers" reason it's just plain stupid to be sipping a cup of hot coffee as you tool down the Munich-Stuttgart autobahn at 130 mph.  Seems to make perfectly good sense to me.  Wanna drink something?  Stop at the nearest Arby's!
ogLHkR0oaa	Already have done so ! Just heard that the required amount has been raised, great stuff !!!!|`|dJyR1p2faa	We paid for this plane with taxpayers money. If you have a good case ask the govt for more money. Good luck.
kgk3Yz9Naa	nope...up to 05,then 06 on are different...ive just checked via ebay..|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	Search the mfg's site. They should have hitches listed by application|`|GxapFaqtaa	Don't think so. BUT you can get one made up for your vehicle, good metal shop, that has an ENGINEER, needs to be certified by the engineer to be road safe, not as deer as you think, I had a car that there was no tow bar for and got one make many years ago. I put tow bars on every car I owned it protects the back of the car more stop more people tail gating.
S4soZUFCaa	The eject button or switch may be stuck.
iNXqiDIYaa	providing everything is ok with the application shouldn't take more than 14 days
S4soZUFCaa	If car tires were solid, the ride would be horrible, and they would cost 3 times as much. Air filled tires, absorb the bumps and grab the road in corners, so they handle better.|`|B0LviMacaa	Remember back to your childhood and the bumpy ride of your tricycle. No amount of suspension could make up for solid tires.|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	The air acts as an additional component of the suspension, absorbing a lot of the bumps before they make it to the suspension. Without air, the ride would be too harsh.<br>  <br>  Also, air-filled tires allow the tire to contour around objects better as opposed to just slipping off them.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Tires were originally solid rubber, but it's expensive and not as comfy a ride as air-filled.  Imagine how much more rubber would be used for solid tires now.
miyAb7cQaa	You have it about right but check the plug and filter first then check the carb then take it to dealer.
GxO5H9T9aa	did someone say, "Vanity???"|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Probably, it's part of a physical description.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	Probably not, but for sure on your Lic|`|HBFHZXybaa	I don't think it will. I live in NJ, and on my permit it didn't mention my weight. Neither did my license all it said was my height and my eye color. But idk because you live in a different state.
