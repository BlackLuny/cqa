Siempre estoy conviviendo con personas fumadoras y la verdad es sumamente molesto para mi, creo que es un hábito (vicio) además de perjudicial, apestoso y muy egoista, porque no es justo que si yo no quiero fumar, porque las personas no pueden abstenerse o al menos fumar en sitios abiertos, lo peor es estar comiendo y que una persona ni siquiera tenga la educación de preguntar si molesta y simplemente encender un cigarro, como le puedes decir a estas personas que te molesta y que por favor no lo hagan, al menos no contigo, sin ser agresivo ni hacerles sentir mal. Otra cosa no entiendo porque siempre dicen que de algo se han de morir, creo que es la excusa más patética y estúpida que puede haber, en ese caso todos tiremonos a hacer cosas malignas a nuestro ser, que al fin y al cabo algún día y de algo nos hemos de morir, no???

20090227023456AAFgNaz	Health;Mental Health	Please can i have an opinion i'm being manipulated by elderly mother..i want to die from worry?	Please help. I'm a 31 year old adult daughter of a psychriatically ill 68 year old mum. I dont have any siblings. My dad and her have a bad relationship in that she mentally abuses him, so he leaves her house at 10am every morning and does not come back until 8 or 9pm at night, he has his own place a half hours drive away. She is cared for in every practical way, financially, clothes wise, food and has her own independance and car. Her mental illnesses manifests itself in separation anxiety and a 100% lock solid idea in her head idea that my role is to give up my life and my boyfriend (who i live with for 8 years) for her, and she drives this home to me every time i meet her. She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more. Shes coming to me for the weekend and my skin is so bad...please help me.. She even gets so far as accident and emmergecny and gets checked out over and over again in attention seeking behaviour taht keeps everyone worried. Please help   ALSO SHE HAS ACTUALLY BOOKED HERSELF INTO A PRIVATE NURSING HOME FOR THE PAST 4 NIGHTS AND MY DAD HAS PAID FOR IT BUT HAS SORT OF INFERRED THAT IF SHE WANTS TO STAY LONGER I SHOULD COUGH UP TOO. I'M STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY MYSELF AND SHE HAS THE FINANCE HERSELF IF SHE WISHED TO COVER IT.....      i've just spoken to her now and she tells me that she has no change of clothes that she went straight to the nursing home from A & E without any clothes althoug her and my father could have drove 6km by her house to collect a change of clothes knowing she was booking herself in to this home for a few nights. Shes told me this and now I am so upset, knowing my mam is in there with no change of clothes. Also my aunt will probably ring me feeling sorry for her, and almost inferring i should come 90km and organise it for my mum if she wants to stay more nights in the home. I know this is all manipulation but am i strong enough for this pressure.      My dad has his own place and keeps it in a state and although i go there and try to clean it, and i could organise help to do so , he will not allow it, he says he doesnt want strangers in his house, yet i'm worried about the way they live...      JUST TO CONFIRM, SHE IS UNDER PSYCHRIATIC CARE, HAS A DAY CENTRE TO VISIT, HAS HER MEDICATION BLISTER PACKED, HAS A GOOD NURSE AND DOCTOR TO VISIT AND A MENTAL HEALTH NURSE WHO CALLS TO HER SO SHE IS IN THE SYSTEM, HAS A HOMEHELP WHO CALLS ONCE PER WEEK, MUM IS 100% MOBILE AND PHYSCIALLY FIT, AND SHE DRIVES HER OWN CAR.

20081116073041AAGEtpT	Health;Dental	Help- What should I name my Company??? We degsign websites for Dentists. Can You come up with 5 original Names?	I have been racking my brains trying to come up with a company name for a business I want to start. My business is a web design company that focuses only on Dentists. All of my clients will be Dentists. I will be creating their website for their practice. I have come up with some cool names, but they are already taken.       I talked with my attorney and he said I could have the same name as another company in my industry but there are certain legal hoops I would have to clear to make that happen. (EXample: Joe's Garage).       So, I want to come up with an original company name. That way I won't be confused with other competitors.      Please use the following rules before submitting a name.       1) Original name. It can be unique.    2) You can make up a word if you would like. Example: Honda's "Acura" ~~~> they used part of the word accurate. Gives the feeling of being precise and accurate. Great response and performance.   3)Something that would be easy to say and remember.   4) Name that is not already taken and being used.    5) Name that has an available domain name.    6) Name with no numbers associated. Only words. (Example:Studio27)   7) Name that is descriptive would be great.      I know this is a brain storming question, so I thank you for any ideas that you may provide. I will choose the answer with the best name/names. THANK YOU! My brain is fully burned out and I need a fresh perspective.

When i do it, i vomit and that is just painful when i vomit a lot. Iv tried using Nyquil and when i used it, i thought it would get rid of it but it didnt. I didnt have to clear my throat when i woke up (its a drowsy type of medicine)  Iv tried resting a lot but that gets  kind of annoying because clearing your throat may be great but your just going to have to swallow it back inside your throat later so whats the use? And  you cant just leave the mucus inside your throat because the mucus could just build up again. I had a hard time finishing my research report because i had to keep clearing my throat. So any help what so ever would be greatly appreciated. And the cough is just unbearable too. I heard that when you cough, you are expelling all those germs from the cold out of your system. But its painful also.

20090304062700AAvdWHP	Health;Mental Health	How long do withdrawals last from Lexapro? I'm going on day 10?	I was on Lexapro for a total of around 5 years.  I don't even know why I was on it that long-I haven't suffered from depression or anxiety for YEARS.  I am in a completely different stage of my life and ready to come off of it.  I was on 20 mg for a while, then went down to 10 mg for about the last year.  Back in the beginning of January I went down to 5 mg. every night.        **I should mention on a side note-I no longer see my psychiatrist because of stupid insurance problems.  I honestly don't think I need either the Dr. or the drugs anymore.      Anyways, my question is-how long can I expect these horrible withdrawals to last?  Symptoms range from "brain zaps" that come and go every few hours (usually about 10 every few hours).  The last 3 nights I've been jolted out of sleep every hour.  I am extremely moody at times-angry, sad, anxious, or hyper.  It's starting to disrupt my life and is making it hard for me to concentrate at work.  Is there a general timeline for the withdrawal symptoms?  Is there any home remedies (working out, tea, etc.) that will help the process along?        I went through this back when I was 20 (about 6 year ago) when coming off Paxil.  I was really young and didn't know what I was doing so I stopped cold turkey.  Obviously that was a bad idea.  I had extreme "brain zaps" and hallucinations, but those symptoms only lasted about 4 days at the most.  I'm going on 11 now with Lexapro-and I weaned myself off more.        Since I don't have a doctor helping me, I'm just looking for some answers/help.      Thank you,   Amy

20090305062123AAr7lhO	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Question about Alzheimer's Disease experimental treatments....?	I was reading a study that was done on people with Alzheimer's Disease who had received an experimental vaccine to prevent beta-amyloid plaque formations in their brains. The study was done post-mortem, after they had died. It was found that the people receiving the vaccine actually did have much less of the beta-amyloid plaques in their brains then others in the study who did not receive the vaccine.   The vaccine was given to them when they were in the mild to moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease as a treatment, but it proved not to be effective in treating the symptoms of the disease, just preventing the formation of additional beta-amyloid plaques.   The study authors said that they didn't feel that this was going to be an effective treatment and proposed that this type of avenue be abandoned in the future.      So my question is, why do they not try it much earlier in the disease long before symptoms become very apparent? Why not vaccinate a large group of people who have no symptoms and see if they are less likely then the general population to have Alzheimer's or if it is much less severe if they do? I just feel often in medicine they try to treat things too late in the disease.

20081105111803AADw40l	Health;Mental Health	Is there anything like bipolar?	I've suspected for quite a while that I may be bipolar but kept dismissing it as other things. I kept coming back to it though and the more I did the more it made sense. I started doing research into it and a lot of things made sense although not everything applied to me.      I've been depressed since I was 13 but never diagnosed for it because I didn't know that's why I felt like that and only recently realised why. I have periods of normality but they don't last long. I had a significant hypomanic episode in the past two months which lasted about 4 and a half days. I'm fairly sure it was a hypomanic episode because I looked up the symptoms and I had all of them, even the lesser ones. I've also experienced manic symptoms before but they don't last long, usually just a couple of hours. I don't really remember them well though which I've read is a notable thing. They've always occured early in the morning after suddenly waking up usually after a couple of hours sleep and I panic and tend to have a panic attack and will become delirious and sometimes hallucinate. I haven't hallucinated visually for a while but the other week I experienced an auditory hallucination of someone talking and I almost started talking back.      My mood fluctuates a lot and is never the same in any two days generally. It does seem to follow a pattern but not an exact one. It definitely rapidly cycles sometimes changing with 5 - 10 minutes.      I've felt suicidal a lot lately and only started feeling like that last year which scared me a lot because I have a fear of death, if that makes sense. I think it's my fear of death that stops me from ever doing anything because I'll be thinking about it and maybe even go to do it but I don't. I've been to the doctor about it and had to wait 3 months for an appointment to be assessed, then had to wait another month for a follow up one and now have to wait again to finally have an official assessment because the last two times I've had a counsellor do it. I've tried to explain things to her but she dismissed it as normal somewhat. I was quite angry about it to be honest because it's obviously not normal to feel like this and I don't wanna end up in hospital although I've nearly gone before.      Anyway, I was just wondering if there's anything like bipolar disorder but different because it doesn't sound like I have it apparently. The counsellor said it could be something anxiety related but I haven't come across anything like that.      Sorry about the length lol.

My tests came back negative (no gonorrhea, no chlamydia), but the symptom persisted so I took a course of doxycycline. The symptoms disappeared, but returned five weeks later (FYI: no sexual exposure since before the FIRST treatment in January) so I went on a week of erythromycin, and the discharge continues. More, a return to the doctor initially revealed, again, no gonorrhea, no chlamydia, nor any apparent prostate swelling or abnormality.

20090227033529AAOqM3B	Health;Mental Health	Please help me..i feel like dying?	Please help. I'm a 31 year old adult daughter of a psychriatically ill 68 year old mum. I dont have any siblings. My dad and her have a bad relationship in that she mentally abuses him, so he leaves her house at 10am every morning and does not come back until 8 or 9pm at night, he has his own place a half hours drive away. She is cared for in every practical way, financially, clothes wise, food and has her own independance and car. Her mental illnesses manifests itself in separation anxiety and a 100% lock solid idea in her head idea that my role is to give up my life and my boyfriend (who i live with for 8 years) for her, and she drives this home to me every time i meet her. She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more. Shes coming to me for the weekend and my skin is so bad...please help me.. She even gets so far as accident and emmergecny and gets checked out over and over again in attention seeking behaviour taht keeps everyone worried. Please help   ALSO SHE HAS ACTUALLY BOOKED HERSELF INTO A PRIVATE NURSING HOME FOR THE PAST 4 NIGHTS AND MY DAD HAS PAID FOR IT BUT HAS SORT OF INFERRED THAT IF SHE WANTS TO STAY LONGER I SHOULD COUGH UP TOO. I'M STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY MYSELF AND SHE HAS THE FINANCE HERSELF IF SHE WISHED TO COVER IT.....      i've just spoken to her now and she tells me that she has no change of clothes that she went straight to the nursing home from A & E without any clothes althoug her and my father could have drove 6km by her house to collect a change of clothes knowing she was booking herself in to this home for a few nights. Shes told me this and now I am so upset, knowing my mam is in there with no change of clothes. Also my aunt will probably ring me feeling sorry for her, and almost inferring i should come 90km and organise it for my mum if she wants to stay more nights in the home. I know this is all manipulation but am i strong enough for this pressure.      My dad has his own place and keeps it in a state and although i go there and try to clean it, and i could organise help to do so , he will not allow it, he says he doesnt want strangers in his house, yet i'm worried about the way they live...      JUST TO CONFIRM, SHE IS UNDER PSYCHRIATIC CARE, HAS A DAY CENTRE TO VISIT, HAS HER MEDICATION BLISTER PACKED, HAS A GOOD NURSE AND DOCTOR TO VISIT AND A MENTAL HEALTH NURSE WHO CALLS TO HER SO SHE IS IN THE SYSTEM, HAS A HOMEHELP WHO CALLS ONCE PER WEEK, MUM IS 100% MOBILE AND PHYSCIALLY FIT, AND SHE DRIVES HER OWN CAR

It just floats there in the scrotum with the testicles. It resides very close to my right testicle and is about the size (~ 1.5 cm) and shape of a lima bean.      I know it could be a number of things, from harmless things to not so harmless. I've read somewhere that a general practitioner can diagnose whether it is something suspicious or not. Is this true? I do not have insurance and am struggling financially, so I cannot afford to see expensive specialists. I am going to go see my campus doctor. Would a campus doctor, presumably being a GP, be able to make a reasonably educated guess as to whether it is something benign, or something that requires an x-ray or MRI or whatever they use in this type of case?

20090227031140AA2DbM3	Health;Dental	Singer Paresthesia high risk patient for upcoming wisdom tooth extraction?	I am scheduled for extraction of all 4 wisdom teeth in 3 days. I met with the surgeon today and was told that I am high risk for paresthesia on both sides. My left bottom wisdom tooth is close to the High Lingual Nerve which could result in loss of sensation on the left side of my tongue. To make matters worse, the right bottom wisdom tooth's roots has actually pushed the Inferior Alveolar Nerve over and is touching the nerve, so extraction of this tooth carries high risk to loss of sensation in my right chin, bottom lip, gums, part of tongue and cheek.      I asked if I would be able to talk/sing properly following surgery, and I was told by the surgeon that my actual speech would not be affected. My dentist said she didn't know to what extent my clear annunciation would be affected. After this 'assurance', I've researched online only to find numerous cases where people's speech has actually been affected (slurred speech or talking like you have food in your mouth). Loss of sensation clearly is upsetting, but loss of being able to speak/sing and annunciate words clearly worries me the most, since this is my livelihood. I have a major music project that I am about to promote within the next 12 months so you can imagine I'm almost panicked about the prospect of not being able to sing/speak properly.      Is it possible to 'only' lose sensation but still be able to speak clearly? If you experience numbness (esp in the tongue on both sides), how is it possible to still manipulate your lips, tongue and chin with accuracy? To maintain all the subtle nuances of speech/singing?      If I could keep the wisdom teeth in, I would. I recently had an acute infection in my right 2nd molar and a year ago, my left back wisdom tooth, so according to both dentist and oral surgeon, getting at least the right bottom 3rd molar out is the only option if I want to avoid future dental complications.      Is there any professional out there who can clarify if my motor functions will remain intact and my speech not affected at all?      Since it's Friday, I can't reach my oral surgeon and the only time I'll be able to speak to him next is the morning of surgery. Advice over this weekend would be greatly valued.      thank you!!
20090227031413AAsLyeM	Health;Dental	How long to wait for bridge/implant after extraction?	I had my first molar (top right) removed on Wednesday.  I had been scheduled for a root canal but elected to have the tooth extracted on my dentists recommendation.  She advised that I may not need anything to fill the space however the gap is much larger than I first thought it would be,  I am regretting not trying to save it now. For both asthetic and practical reasons I'd like a bridge or implant.  I had teeth extracted for overcrowding so only have 1 molar and a wisdom tooth on that side of my mouth now.  My dentist advised I'd need to wait for the bone to heal before having any further work.  How long does that take?   Also is there a maximum time I should leave it?    Are bridges available on the NHS - my dentist implied they were but have since been led to believe probably not.  How much would one cost privately?      Thanks in advance! :D

Here's the deal, I asked a couple of questions related to my daughter's health and I get looked at like some kind of pedophile. Why is it a father cannot take care of his kid's and be praised for it. Why is it considered unacceptable for a dad taking care of his kids to if necessary see their private parts, but perfectly ok for the mom to do it. What are single dad's supposed to do in this scenario? Why is it if a female goes to a male doctor a female nurse is present, but if a male goes to a female doctor they are left alone? If something happens to your kid that is the opposite sex than you or they have to be examined for anything and noone else of the same sex is available, are you just supposed to wait outside while a person you don't really know tends to them, or are you supposed to do your job and stay with your kid no matter what? I'm just so fed up with our society and thinking all males are perv's or have bad motives. How can a father rasie his kids this way?

20090122223133AAAXT8d	Health;Women's Health	Could I have TSS? please help?	Okay so this is my third period ever. So this time I wanted to try tampons. So earlier this day I almost put one in and I chickened out. Didn't even get close. And I read on the box that you could  wear it to bed for for up to 8 hours so I decided I would put one in a 11:00 and get up at 6:00 just to be safe. So when I was trying to put one in and everything was going fine, and when it was about halfway in I started to feel REALLY hot and a little dizzy so I took it out. I threw it away, I then got up to walk around a little bit cuz I was so hot, and I started to get really really dizzy and I felt like I was going to faint. And there was ringing in my ears that was REALLy loud. And then I threw up about 3 times. I read that confusion, along with those, is a symptom but I wasn't really confused. Through this time I just kept thinking, "Omg what if I have TSS? oh crap crap crap"  But I was sorta confused. Does that make sense? Anyways my temperature is 96.2 and I just read that you don't really get TSS unless you kept the tampon in for like 24 hours. Mine was barely even half way in so, What the heck is wrong with me??? BTW I'm fine now, just kinda shaken.

I don't know know what it's called, but you catch my drift!   I've had a rash there for a year and a half. It's very annoying especially during hot days because the rash will get sweaty and even more irritated. It gets really red during the winter too. Really uncomfortable.      A little trick I've been using was spraying one spritz of a flunisolide nasal spray on it.(It's the only thing that has worked so far.) It really reduces the redness and irritation and makes the rash completely disappear for a few days to a week. And I can see now how the exact area that I usually get the rash is starting become drier, so I know the rash is coming back.       I'm almost out of that spray now, and am looking to get rid of this rash! Before I go to the doctor, and it'll be a while before I go anyway, how else can I get rid of this rash?      Keep in mind I've already googled it many times before. Can't find out exactly what's causing it.      Thanks

When a person is in a relationship who is depressed is it typical for the depressed person to feel like they aren't good enough to be with the person they are with? My ex b/f suffers from bad depresssion and mild bipolar and always said he couldn't believe that I was with him because he was a loser and I deserved better. Is this "normal" thinking for depression? I never looked at it that way but he just couldn't seem to get over it and yet he wants me to be his friend and calls me his best friend. Of course I will be but it is difficult for me to think of him as only a friend. Is this just a way for him to cope with his illness and still keep me in his life but not thave the pressures of a relationship. Does he still have strong feelings for me with the hope of rekindling what we had? Would he be hurt if I dated others even though we are only "friends"? Thanks everyone.

I think I’ve changed so much in my diet and exercise that I should be out of the plateau by now! But it’s not working and I want to weigh 130 lbs by March 16th! HELP ME =(

I usually get horrible cramps and headaches at the start of my period and last night/yesterday, that's exactly what happened.  I took 2 mg of dilauded around 4pm yesterday and laid down for a nap.  an hour later, I was still in pain so I took another 2 mg of dilauded.  Around 9pm I woke up again and took my regular pills (40 mg of Prozac and 180 mg of Verapamil) and since the headache was still there, I took 1 fioricet and 50 mg of benedryl.   Last night around midnight my boyfriend texted me and woke me up and I noticed that I felt disconnected from my body.  Its like.... I touch myself or scratch myself and I can't feel anything.  It is a very weird feeling, like I'm dreaming.  So I went back to sleep and woke up this morning around 6 to study for an exam I have at noon, but the disconnected feeling is still here.

20090305062817AAeqHyu	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can you cure yourself of eating disorders?	I suffered with an eating disorder for two years, it was pretty bad and I starved myself until 4 in the afternoon then ate anything and everything and threw it back up immediately. I have also had issues with self harm such as; cutting with razors/glass, burning, swallowing harmful chemicals and cutting the skin from my feet so it hurt when I walked. Yeah, it was kind of serious.   Anyway, I stopped making myself sick about 6 months ago and I stopped cutting myself about 4 months ago( but that was mainly because I was embarrassed by the scars). I still hate all the things I hated about myself before but now have more to hate, I just don't hurt myself like I used to, in fact I now have no way of venting my frustration.    I have told a close friend of mine about my problems, though I tried to deny the fact that I actually had an eating disorder. She has spent the last two years in hospitals because she suffered Post-Traumatic-Stress disorder and so she has experienced some pretty bad things but also knows a lot about mental disorders. I told her that I had cured myself because I'm a strong willed person(clearly not true) and she tells me she wants me to get help because my problems will likely come back to me and I think she may be right.    But is it possible I have 'cured' myself or should I expect a relapse? Has anyone else ever cured themselves? And how serious do you think my condition would be? Also, if I were to go to threapy or something what should I expect?

20090305072250AAw8HBd	Health;Mental Health	How do I go on antidepressants?	So I think I have depression.  I had a lot of **** happen in my life about five months ago, and ever since then I've just been in a very dark place.  Half the time I just feel numb, like nothing I do matters.  The other times I feel lonely, guilty, like there's chunks of me missing.      I tried to go on St. John's Wort and 5-HTP supplements and they made me feel better for a time.  It was such a noticeable difference, to finally feel motivated to live, but they stopped working.      I was thinking of going in to see my GP to get a script for something light, at least to get me through til' summer when more sunshine will do the trick.  Would that be okay, or should I go straight to a psychiatrist?  I'm afraid I'll get told to go to therapy, but I don't want to.  I realize there is no reason now that I should be sad, there's no issues, I just AM.

Its not that i'm afraid of eating and putting on wieght, its just that since i was 4 or 5 i stopped eating what my mother gave me. Apparently i was just very stubborn when it came to eating healthy foods. She had no other options than to give me different meals.       Not junk foods, just a very select foods. Other the years this has developed into me having an extremely small variety of foods that i eat, and seem to have a mental block for trying new foods. I tried to eat ravioli last week, I was so was scared of trying it that it brought me to tears. I'm so so sick of the foods i currently eat as i have eaten the same thing for pretty much the last 10 years of my life.    No More Mi Goreng!!!         I haven't eaten anything healthy in years, literally, And i only average one meal a day. I am really skinny, it hurts when ever i bump a bone onto something, even if it's a soft bump. My legs hurt when i squat down and because of the lack of protein that has entered my body these past 21 years, i am very low on muscle and i can't even do 3 push ups.   I know, I'M A PUSSY!       Because of my build i have zero self esteem, i'm in the supposed prime of my life and i don't even try to pick up women. My back also hurts sometimes. Even though i'm seeing a dietician and a pyschologist, I don't see anyway out of my habits.       I dont know how i turned a one line question into my life story, I'll ask again anyway. Do i have anorexia? and can a guy even suffer from that? Thanks

20090305070817AAkOA6Y	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	How does coming off and going on lithium affect mood and how quickly?	My bipolar girlfriend of 2 years came off her meds in december, started to get seriously unhappy and feel trapped almost left. Then began to go manic towards Christmas/New Year time. Later she admitted she had cheated around then. Then she wanted to move out. Changed her mind. Then did and later claims to have tried to keep seeing this guy she cheated on me for. Meanwhile she kept sending messages saying she wanted to come home but needed space for a while. Then at last when I told her I was getting ill myself from not knowing what she wanted, she confessed to cheating. I asked her if she was sorry and wanted to work it out or just leave. She finally said she is now seeing this guy so it was over for us. Then I find her profile appearing for the first time on a dating site last night. This whole two months sounds a lot like the stuff she has told me about herself before she was diagnosed and got treatment but is not much like her since then. She claims to have only been off Lithium for about a month, which would mean she is back on it now for about 2 months. Can anybody with experience tell me if this could still be a manic episode, she claims her psychiatrist has discharged her and she is fine, but she was hallucinating on 15th Feb and told nhs 24, so i'm not sure I believe her. She always seemed to love me very much when we were together and was almost too clingy in the house but then around december time she definitely didn't want me with her outside in clubs. she seemed genuinely happy and excited when we got engaged on 18th December, think she cheated the week later. Before she left she was very convincing that she hoped we would get back together but as soon as she left she liked to tell me on phone and texts that she loved me and wanted to come home, but seemed totally detached whenever I saw her. She also seems to have genuinely found this very hard. But she seems to have made it harder than it should have been. Is this just the worst handled break up in history or could there be some bipolar symptoms running about in there?

I can't think straight and my body is exhausted.  My heart beats at 80rpm, from originally 60rpm.  I had to quit running track because I was so exhausted, no matter how much exercise, food or sleep I had.  I can't focus in school anymore and I can hardly get myself out of bed or to work.  After school I lay in bed from 3pm until around 9pm and read or just lay there.  The worst is that I want to go out and live again but physically I just can't.  I feel major brain fog, like I can't process thoughts quickly, and math is impossible for me now.  I failed statistics and I'm failing trig.  My hair is falling out too, every time I get a shower there's so much hair in my hands.  I'm shaky and just walking across a parking lot or up some stairs in school makes me short of breath, like an old person.  I get lightheaded too but the weirdest thing is my brain pulses, like I have this really quick 1 second thing where it feels like my brain stops working, like i'm drunk.  I was taking 10mg of ambien for a while but I stopped, and I take 20mg of lexapro.  I'm also prescribed to 10mg of adderall but I haven't taken that as much because I lost a lot of weight.   I've tried everything, from drinking more water to getting to bed early but nothing is helping.  I feel like a zombie.

20090305073044AAusKyw	Health;Mental Health	Am I suffering from anxiety or depression? (3 ?'s)?	I have no idea what is wrong with me.  I went to my primary care and he was ready to provide some anxiety meds and behavioral therapy but wanted me to wait a little longer.      It started last Monday.  Maybe it was building up before then.  But Monday afternoon when stressing about a paper, I just collapsed.  I started worrying about the most random things.  Finding a job, passing the BAR, retirement, where I'll live, if my family will be poor, etc, etc.  I have never worried about anything seriously in my life.  But I was flipping out.  I started crying in school.  Calling my girl friend crying.        Anyway I thought the three items that have affected me are: two projects and finding a summer job.  I found a summer job, after multiple rejections.  The two projects are due next week, but I am on the right track with them.        But I am still freaking out.  I am looking up how to pass the bar.  Worrying about classes I never worried about it.  The anxiety isn't as bad itself, but now I have physical symptoms.        The worst is the morning.  Every morning I wake up with a terrible vomit feeling.  My doctor prescribed something to calm down my stomach but I haven't taken it yet.         To add to it, I don't feel like doing anything.  I haven't worked out in two weeks, and while I usually feel good at night, the morning's to mid-afternoon are awful.  It's taking a toll on me and my girlfriend.

If I get prescribed some sort of Xanax, Lexpro, will I be able to function and study normally?        3.  Could my morning sickness somehow be something else and how do I get it to stop?       Thank you.

My wedding is coming up in about 3 months, and I'd like to drop just a few lbs beforehand.       I am starting off at 145 (at 5'8"). It's hard for me to lose weight because there's not all that much to come off, and it comes off SLOOOOW.  I'd like to get down to in between 130 and 135.      How can I do this? I already eat very healthy (lots of fruits, veggies, etc.) and don't snack or eat junk or fast food, I don't drink soda, and I like to drink a lot of water.       I don't really exercise all that much, because it isn't fun to me. If it were more enjoyable, I'd probably do it more.      Suggestions?

He can go for a really long time and its amazing. BUT the second time around, which was like an hr or 2 later he couldn't keep it up. He was hard for a little and it was good but then he got soft. He said that he can't go twice with a condom, it is too restricting the second time around and he can't stay hard. He claims he is fine to go for round 2 w/o a condom tho. I did not try this theory bc i do not have unprotected sex for a number of reasons. lol   Anyways is this a common thing for guys? I honestly have to say i do not mind it so much bc he is great the first time around and last long but i am curious.   oh n he did mention something about usually using different condoms (a little bigger).

20090305081203AAq2Sur	Health;Diet & Fitness	Breakfast versus Calories -- Which Wins?	It's "common knowledge" that whether or not you're dieting, you should eat a healthy breakfast to start the day.      But here's my question -- I don't get hungry until noon anyway.  If I eat a breakfast, I'm hungry in the early afternoon and need lunch.  If I DON'T eat a breakfast, I'm also hungry in the early afternoon and need lunch.  There's no difference in mood or energy between the two.      So all things being equal, a day with breakfast is simply a day with 200-400 more calories.      My question is, if eating early doesn't quell unhealthy eating or solve a low-energy issue, then do *I* really need to be eating breakfast, or can I do what feels natural, eat first at midday, and stay on my diet that way?
