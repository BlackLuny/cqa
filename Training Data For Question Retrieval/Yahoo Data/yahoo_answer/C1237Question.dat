20090220072959AATsdV1	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Help with static friction and force?	A block with a mass of 3.83 kg is placed at rest on a surface inclined at an angle of 40.2° above the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface is 0.540, and a force of magnitude  pushes upward on the block, parallel to the inclined surface. The block will remain at rest only if  is greater than a minimum value, Fmin, and less than a maximum value, Fmax.       a) Calculate Fmin.   b) Calculate Fmax.

20090220080819AAhAMno	Science & Mathematics;Biology	How long could a human life be prolonged?	This is a hypothetical question, what I want to know is that given ideal conditions could lifespan be extended beyond the 120 or so years claimed in the Guiness Book of Records?   If a person had access to unlimited first class medical care and organ transplantation could they possibly live to 200? 300? Forever?   People who die of old age are really dying of organ failure, if a 30 year old required a heart/lung or kidney transplant we would make every effort to ensure his survival but if he was 85 years old he would just be allowed to die as donor organs being in short supply then preference would be given to younger recipients.   If he had access to unlimited supply of organs from young healthy donors then at what point would it become impossible to sustain life?

I believe I understand the matter when I state that natural selection refers to the strong surviving to breed, and the weak or majorly flawed die off. This ensures that a species, whether human or animal, goes on.       However I have been thinking recently about medical science. Surely as technology progresses and we can save a lot more severely disabled people or those with genetic deficiencies, this means that the weak are still contributing to the species whereas nature dictates thy they die out?

Label them true or false.      - A hydrogen atom is attracted to an unshared pair of electrons during hydrogen bonding.    -Atoms tend to form bonds so that each has eight electrons in its highest energy level.    - Short covalent bonds have more energy than long covalent bonds.    -When drawing a Lewis structure, the most electronegative atom is placed in the center (except for hydrogen).    - Lattice energy is the energy released when an ionic crystal forms. It is equal to the energy needed to break the crystal apart.    - Nonpolar covalent bonds have a low ionic character.    -Nonmetals are usually more electronegative than metals.    -Multiple covalent bonds usually have less energy than single covalent bonds.             Indicate whether the chemical forumula indicated reprensents a molecular compound or an ionic compound.       Molecular Compound Ionic- HCl    Molecular Compound Ionic- NH3    Molecular Compound Ionic- H2O    Molecular Compound Ionic- HgBr2    Molecular Compound Ionic- CO          Enter the symbols for the ions contained in the following compounds.    Give the cation symbol first followed by the anion symbol, separated by a single space.    (On the computer use the ^ character to indicate superscripts.    Note that when the magnitude of the ionic charge is 1, the numeral ``1'' is not entered.    e.g. Ga^3+ As^3- or H^+ F^-)       MgSe    FeF3    BeBr2    K3P             These are a mix (maybe) of ionic and covalent compounds: Name these compounds. Spell sulfide with the f not the ph. If the metal is a transition metal, you will need to use roman numerals in parentheses, no space between the metal and the parentheses, e.g. iron(III) oxide Covalent compounds should follow IUPAC naming methods.

20090220103749AAIyJZD	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	We have found massive amounts of building debris in our front and back yards. Some of it glowed. Toxic?	We built our home 6 years ago in a beautiful neighborhood. There was an existing 100 yr old pecan tree in back and we chose our lot based on that. The builder also supplied three other trees and complete sod in the front yard. We had them plant two elms in the front and one in back. We also paid almost $2000 extra to place sod in back. The elm in back died within a month and the grass deteriorated shortly after. We decided recently to grow grass in the back and after several attempts with seeding and sodding we had no luck. I thought aeration might help but everytime something was placed in the ground we pulled out various building materials... shingles, drywall, rusted metal, nails and tools. I worked night and day to remove as much as possible and encountered something strange. When I would dig at night I would sometimes hit something with my shovel that gave a soft pinkish glow. The light would fade after about 5 seconds. It usually occurred in the top 1 to 6 inches of the soil. Anyone ever heard of this and is it harmful? Our builder was Engle homes who now have lawsuits filed against them for building on old bombsites. I don't think we have bombs to worry about but I wonder what else may be down there!!

20090220095256AAnmhN3	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Hard Math Problem Alg 2 Please?	HELP PLEASE!      A kayaker paddled 2 hours with a 6 mph current in a river. The return trip against the same current took 3 hours. Find the speed the kayaker would make in still water.       The distance is the same both upstream and downstream and can be represented by "d." The rate is tricky. The trip downstream (with the current) is faster than the upstream trip (against the current). We don't know the speed the kayaker makes in still water, so we can represent that with "r."    We do know that going with the current will add 6mph to this rate (r + 6), and going against the current will subtract 6mph from his rate (r - 6). Now we can write two equations (we have two unknowns). Using d = rt again, the equation upstream is: d = (r - 6)3. You write the equation for the equation downstream, and solve the system. Don't forget the units in your answer.        Thank you so much! :)

I am writing an acrostic poem that lists facts about Chemical and physical changes   . This is what I have so far. Can you think of something for the remaining letters?         P hysical change is a process in which a substance changes its physical form or appearance   H eat will usually bring on a physical change.   Y ou can tell if a physical change has occurred, because no new substance is formed.   S ubstances may change form or state – whether solid, liquid or gas, if a physical change occurs.   I ce was at one time water, until it got colder, and a physical change took place.   C utting a piece of paper is an example of a physical change.   A    L      C hemical changes, or chemical reactions, are changes that result in the production of a new substance.   H    E nergy being released, such as heat or light, is a sign of a chemical change.   M   I   C ommon vocabulary associated with chemical changes are ‘burning’, ‘rotting’, ‘decomposing’,  ‘cooking, and ‘photosynthesis’.   A   L
