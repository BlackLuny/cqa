2d2ZuimCaa	We all are born atheist. I heard the Word of God on the station " Family Radio " and became born again in ' 97. Romans 10:17 " So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I'm still an atheist. I just had to respond to Jaime's post. Do you think being an atheist makes one a horrible person? Do you think we act like you did just because we are atheists? Some of us are smart enough to realize the real world reasons not to engage in those behaviors without having to believe in deities. Sheesh, how sad. I do think that for the most part when you find an atheist that becomes a theist its usually someone like Jaime that was an atheist without thinking about it and lacked the common sense to live their life making good choices on their own. They get themselves into lots of problems and then turn to religion to sort it out. Loads of people who are atheists though are so because they did a lot of personal searching and research and are intelligent enough to lead well adjusted lives for the real world consequences of choices. They are quite unlikely to convert to theism.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Was neither  .  And have no desire to become one either  .

I was logical and thought you had to accept the teachings of the churches in order to believe in God. I couldn't accept that.There were just too many "gaps". As I explored my spiritual side, which was not intended to find anything but peace of mind, it became clear that I could reconcile God with everything else in the world without having to give up my most prized opinion, that the world had to make sense.Unless you have found that peace of mind there really is no way to explain how good it feels to know that everything is exactly the way it should be. People , places and things are not mistakes, they all fit into the greater picture with a God of peace and love.|`|T52vXXBJaa	Actually, it's the other way around: I used to believe in God but now I don't.

I'm also a second degree black belt in a few styles of martial arts, so you can imagine the monster that was unleashed.    I became  a collector for dealers, and earned the nickname the redheaded devil.  I was a horrible person, you didn't want to know me, girls didint'want to date me, and nobody wanted to be my friend, that last part was fine, I just wanted the money anyways.    Then the girl I was dating told me she was pregnant and leavning me for my best friend, I was totally stunned, so after attemtpting to kill this man on 3 separate occasions I calmed down and went home and focused on the life that was about to come into this world,  I didn't know if it was a boy or girl yet (it was  girl)  I put my hands on my bathroom sink and stared into the mirror for 30 minutes I didn't move.    I asked myself if I liked who and what I saw and I didn't, not at all,  a life was about to come into this world and it was my responsibility, something had to change.    I knew I was as high as a kite when her mother got pregnant, so being unsaved I immediately asked God to not let her be born retarded or handicapped in anyway and she was born beautifully,  but anyways, in my 31 years of life I had tried everything my way-------what did it get me?    addicted to drugs, and a child on the way.    So I did the God thing and never looked back, it has been one great trip.    Now I think much clearer and laugh when atheists say Christians are closed minded LOL  I was never so free thinking as I am now.    Atheism is a poor way to go even if hell wasn't real.

After a NDE, I went into denial about the existance of deities, and after awhile, including experiences with healing that were medically impossible, I became/returned to my original polytheist beliefs.

Why on earth would think it is anything but chance.  just look at all the possibilities there have been  in the last 13 1/2 billion years.

It looks exactly like something that came together through the separate evolution of separate systems.    No, it doesn't seem designed at all.

I don't think it was right for his friend to give you his number especially after you told him you were attracted to him. He should have given HIM your number or else it can be stalking. I would have tried people search before asking his friend for his number.     if you do get in touch with him I would simply tell him how much he influenced you as a teacher and that if it would be okay you would like to get together because you wanted to confide something in him. Be cool, make it sound more on a teacher/student level than a friend level.

We all need a companion, a friend a mate. That makes us happier. Unfortunately people don't believe that anymore and i think that this is a sociological phenomenon.

5qjxyb0jaa	It's a hang over from when the British pulled out of India , it was once all India|`|AA11477027	No,its the Kashmir issue.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	In most cases yes. In India there are Muslims and Hindus - loads.    Something to know and think about: Islam has many parts and Pakistanis are quite strict with it.    Wahabi Islam arose in the 18th century in Saudi Arabia, and would probably have remained insignificant, and considered heretical by the mainstream, but for twentieth century oil wealth. Wahabiism adopts a much more hard-line interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith, and indeed added requirements such as the covering of women and prohibition on them driving cars. The excesses of the Taliban in Afghanistan originated in Wahabiism, as does the al Quaeda terror campaign against the western world.    Other islamic parts: 1.Shia and 2.Sunni strains split within a generation after the death of Mohammed, over disputes about succession. Doctrinal differences are not great, but bitterness and persecution can be extreme. (eg under Saddam Hussein in Iraq)    3.Sufi Islam is more mystical and concerned with a personal relationship with the allah god.    Indian Hindus seem more down to earth than Pakistani's in general. Pakistani's and Hindus are devided socially, religiously. They do not get on.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	Partly yes.  Also some trouble relates to the English dividing the continent into two back in 1947.

After the independence of India from the British Empire, the Hindus and Muslims battled it out for their own separate states. In the process Pakistan was formed, and millions of people were killed or displaced in the chaos which ensued (--the populations were quite mixed, so all Hindus in Pakistan fled to India, and many Muslims in India fled to the new Pakistan).    The current conflict over Kashmir is an extension of that. Technically it would have naturally been a part of Pakistan, because it had a Muslim majority, but the hereditary ruler of Kashmir at the time was not a Muslim, and insisted the region remain within India.  The issue is still unresolved.|`|VzCygD6taa	No mankind is responsible for there actions in the name of religion.|`|VcM9zyikaa	yes|`|T0xLpygfaa	because america armed al queda in the late seventies to help oust the russians from afghanistan.     they are now based in pakistan but make regular forays into neighbouring india. witness the latest atrocity in mumbai.    all religion is poison to human society.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	We the British left all areas with land to fight over;  Kashmir  Gaza  and anywhere else where we have been, why? simple really, if the pakistanis and indians keep fighting each other, they wont even think about ruling other people.|`|nddmwDAmaa	Religion NO.  Religious Extremists YES  Both religions of Pakistan and India prefer peace Their believes are different but they live on the same principals. The source of tensions is the wish of both sides for revenge, to get kashmir and to play politics dirtier than the other. why is it that India never raised eyebrows on Pakistan over so many other blasts, why just in 2002 and 2008-09. Elections are coming my friend.|`|DFrzrmiDaa	If religion would be responsible then why not INDIA vs BANGADESH; the main reason is that when Pakistan came into existence INDIA doesn't like it (this is understandable as nobody will like to give its land) so INDIA initially created problems for PAKISTAN so as it will again become one state. Difficulties like KASHMIR being majority MUSLIMS was not handed over to PAK although PAK had handed over JUNAGARH & MUNAWADAR  to INDIA  see history  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Inte...   India killed Pakistani immigrants, stopped the river flows to Pakistan , indulge in separation of east and west pakistan and their political leaders made wars to influence voting. pakistan in return created an army which is still 1/4th of what india have but courageous enough to hold INDIA back. This could be a statement of a patriotic Pakistani ............ but telling you the truth whta has done is history now the people of both nations are open minded and friendly only the tension is because of political leaders.|`|tn3CCytmaa	Well    I think responsibility is on Indians shoulders as they had made up their mind against Pakistan and not ready to change it .    They wanted to destroy Pakistan from Day first .    When their mind setting changed tensions will resolves.
BzrUWCsDaa	Matthew 18:23-35 is a good account to read.  It helps us to get things in perspective. Sometimes we dwell on such menial things & can harbour grudges over things that should be forgotten.  When you think that our relationship with Jehovah could be affected if we're not willing to forgive or that it shows a proud attitude, that should be incentive to do something about it.    Of course it's harder if someone has wronged us in a devastating way. The only thing we can do then is to trust Jehovah & leave the matter in Jehovah's hands.    Psalm 130:3,4|`|oGVvEl3Maa	J.S.

Jesus urged us to pray: Forgive us our debts. (Matthew 6:12) Jesus thus likened sins to debts. (Luke 11:4) When we sin, we become debtors to Jehovah. Regarding the meaning of the Greek verb translated forgive, one reference work says: To let go, give up, a debt, by not demanding it. In a sense, when Jehovah forgives, he cancels the debt that would otherwise be charged against our account. Repentant sinners can thus take comfort. Jehovah will never demand payment for a debt he has canceled!Psalm 32:1,?2.    14 Jehovahs forgiveness is further described at Acts 3:19: Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out. That last phrase translates a Greek verb that can mean to wipe out, .?.?. cancel or destroy. According to some scholars, the image expressed is that of erasing handwriting. How was this possible? The ink commonly used in ancient times was made of a mixture that included carbon, gum, and water. Soon after working with such ink, a person could take a wet sponge and wipe the writing away. Therein is a beautiful picture of Jehovahs mercy. When he forgives our sins, it is as though he takes a sponge and wipes them away.    Hope this help!|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	You forgot when Jesus kicked out the money changers in the temple.

But you will agree that once freedom is granted, do you think everything works fine there? If  ... the things do not go right, do you think it would be right to blame the sacrifices of the valiant freedom fighters? Well, whether it is particular religion or a particular Country, it always comes with a sincere need of responsibility of every individual.

What animals do do, is kill or abandon, weak or deformed offspring.  Also, I have never used nature to support homosexuality.  Certainly, homosexuality is common among many species of animals, but human homosexuality is not a wanton sexual act.  To liken it to two dogs on heat is degrading and insulting.  Crawl back under your rock|`|AA12252260	You are right. We are NOT animals. We may be classified as "mammals," but that in and of itself does not classify us as animals.

No they would rather believe that they are their own gods and let satin control them instead of taking a Stand on something so True and logical as the Word of God which even Science now has accepted and has Proved that they  will go to any length to get away from truly thinking ans studying something that could help them!

Because they would rather be known as animals themselves than known as men made in the image of the eternal God.  To be made in the image of God shouts that there is dignity and accountability attached to it.  What dignity is there in sin?  What honesty is in it?  As to be expected, man's attempt to blend in with lower creatures only outs him as sinful.  Animals do not suppress the truth of God. Only man does that.  Man is not an animal.|`|7a1853a34fef93b27c82b0bacf06c7c6aa	Dats a good one. Truth hurts some.|`|TDo1EMJkaa	Bear in mind that humans are also creatures of nature... Homosexuality is just as natural as heterosexuality, the only thing is that you can't get a baby from gay sex.
U5DDwHRMaa	I'm not sure a person CAN be objective when it comes to religion, Nobody can possibly have it ALL figured out, like I've said since I was old enuf to think for myself, when my Grandparents weren't dragging, sorry when my GrandMother wasn't dragging me to church 3 times a week, yes I said dragging, if I had my druthers as a teen, I would have went with friends, but I also learnt a lot going to church, I learnt how bad people can be and how religion is just that, religion, WE gave it that name, each person has to answer to themselves or to God should he really exist. I hope he does, cuz I am as objective as they get when it comes to what I believe, I face what I am and what I believe head on and I don't lie to myself or others or GOD, I've always admitted that I don't know which I believe in, God or Evolution? Maybe someday I'll find out after I'm gone, but if it's the evolution angle, I won't find out, cuz I won't BE, period. I don't think, God, if he is as we have all made him out to be, we, meaning those who wrote the Bible, I don't think he would send someone to Hell for having doubt, after all he gave us a mind of our own to use, and that's all Im doing when I'm not afraid to admit I have doubt. I went to church for toooo many years only to find out later that a lot of the members were as fake as a, as a, can't think of anything, but fake none the less, I thought I believed once, but come to find out, I was just afraid to admit I wasn't sure, I was just afraid cuz I didn't want to go to hell, like I said in earliler answers, I don't think God will send anyone to hell for being honest with him or ourselves. That would defeat the whole purpose for all the want and need to go to heaven, if he's so mean, why would we want to go there? Right?|`|s40sgQ45aa	Questions are good.  God answers questions.

A LOT of questions and answers here bear that out.|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	I'm agnostic, i guess. I find myself constantly going in between Agnostic Atheist and Agnostic Christian.

It pretty much means you can believe in anything at anytime and at any place...even if you only believe for a second. :)|`|ccOJn7q8aa	you cant be very religious if you are questioning your own faith.    Why do people lately feel that they need to question God?    what would you do differently in your life if God came to you and said I am your creator?    would you become a different person once you had the evidence of God?  I know you've probably heard this many times but, just because you can not see it doesnt mean it doesnt exist|`|EAuMJrs4aa	of course i do i wouldnt be human if i didnt stop and doubt even my own beliefs sometimes, one conclusion i never question is that if there is a god the organized religions have the wrong idea about what he/she/it actually is|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	You won't go to Hell for simply questioning your religion.

Atheists and Scientology cannot be sure their way of thinking is correct and neither can religious fanatics. Why?    Because none of them have ever been dead before!|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Objectivity?

4sUek7ugaa	A major part of doctrine came about when some theologian read the Bible and played "connect the dots."  There are many doctrines that aren't there at all, but once someone invents the doctrine they can point to the verses they used and say, "See?  This verse is evidence that I'm correct" and never admit that they just picked widely separated verses out of context and constructed a doctrine around them.  Later theologians are taught in seminary that those verses mean what the first theologian said they did, and the doctrine gets passed on that way.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	Actually if you read the writings of Augustine and those of the Christian faith before him, back dating to the apostles you would know that these doctrinal teachings did not originate from Augustine as you suggest, they are part of the original faith and yes they are described clearly in the Bible.    Please try reading the works in question rather than just believing the false claims of others that simply bear false witness to discredit those of the early Church so they can try vainly to justify their own misinterpretations of the scriptures.|`|8051f43b2bc719ecc6bce44edb91221baa	Actually, these things are in the Bible.  The book of Revelation describes Hell as a lake of fire.  Jesus himself describes Hell as being like Gehennah, a burning garbage dump outside Jerusalem, and also as the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.    As for original sin, the essentials of the doctrine are indeed found in the Bible:  that our first parents, Adam and Eve, brought sin into the world, and because of their sin, we too have inherited this propensity to sin.    St. Augustine takes some flack nowadays for seeing original sin as something of a sexually transmitted disease (so I have heard), something few moderns would agree with.  But the basic principle is sound.    Sin and hell are unpleasant doctrines, no doubt about it.  But they are attested to in the Bible and part of the received Christian faith.  It is important to remember that they are not the last word -- as Christians, we believe that Jesus came to save humanity from sin, death, and the devil.    A related note:  just because something isn't in the Bible doesn't mean it isn't true.  For a Christian, truth must be consistent with what is found in the Bible, but God reveals himself to us in other ways as well -- in his creation, for example.  The Church Fathers are important witnesses to us of the ancient Christian faith, and Augustine is one of the best.  I'm reading his Confessions right now, and they're a fascinating story of conversion to Christ.  Highly recommended.
crnjv96Faa	1 and 2 and 3 are just ways of producing the same thuing. there would be no diffrence. the child would still be biracial, but just that from a biracial couple for  3. ive never heard it though. but i do know people who are 1/3 biracial.with one parent bieng mixed and the other has one less whit or black grand parent or parent|`|qvycijbOaa	Interesting question.  I am of the opinion that people with black fathers and white mothers usually identify with their black side. Not necesarrily because of their physical appearance (although most mixed race people look black as opposed to white) but more because of the cultural effect of having a black father. I generally see that white mothers are comfortable knowing that their children will 'look black' and are even more attracted to this possibility.    This is completely opposite when a white father and a black woman are involved because it is a matter of pride. Generally all of the mixed race people that I know with white fathers identify themselves as strictly mixed race. The ones with black fathers are less strict on their identification and wouldn't mind being called mixed race or black. I see it as a form of pride when a father has a child, wanting that child to identify themselves as what he is, this is a lot of white fathers wouldn't let their child go around saying they are black, in my opinion. The legacy of the parent is in his children, so if he wanted a child that wouldn't identify itself as a different race to his own he could easily marry a white woman.    Two mixed race people having children is very rare to me at the moment, usually these people will identify themselves as black, and more often than not the babies look 'more black' so to speak, than the parents do, however this is not always the case as this video explains http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgfObCmWJ...    This is a very interesting topic and there is definetely a dynamic behind it, check my question out based on what you are asking, it is similar to this one. I asked it a while ago.
nQW1MSMpaa	It does?    God, I wish I was a Rice Queen!      Edit....      Ooh. No. Wait!    Could it be that Thailand has a higher population than Canada?

I'm a genius!|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Does Thailand really have more gay people than Canada? How do you know that?    If it is true, I suggest that it could be because other Asian cultures tend to be very homophobic and repressive towards gay people.

Yeah, I'd say she might be interested in you.|`|jTy3qRVdaa	I think if you go to a all girl school you are more likely to become attracted to the same sex as you because you don't have that contact with the opposite sex as you would at a mixed school.

nQW1MSMpaa	A lot of guys need to do this to lose their inhibitions. Because they haven't come to terms with their sexuality, they haven't faced their demons, they need to get drunk or high in order to do it.

My advice? keep away if you're in or falling in love with him. those people are life wasters for others.

9XA7KxK5aa	To lead china going toward a stronger nation is not because of communism, but good leadership.    When I read the chinese history, I found that there were good and capable leaders in all the best dynasties. I further found that a bad, selfish, weak, incapable and  cruel leader could only bring a dynastiy to an end.    Just look at how the usa turnng from a wealthy and strong country during the Clinton adminstration to now such a mess after merely  8 years, it proved the importance of leadership.    Therefore, to answer your question, if you want a country to be a better country, be a wise person, vote for a really capable candidate to be the country's leader and not voting a celebrity  type of candidate like Sarah Palin.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	China has enough people that they can send more people into combat than we have in our entire military and still have plenty of extra men.

If you just walk into a room and sort of mumble a generic "salam".. probably maybe one or two might mumble back..  but I usually stop, look around, smile real big and say loud enough for all to hear "salaam alaykum".. and usually no one doesnt want to be the one that doesnt say it back...  So you hear a chorus of Salams coming back.. sometimes it just makes everyone else smile.. I challenge myself sometimes to say it.. And always with a smile, or sometimes I grab their hand (ladies of course, cause no males) and say it loudly.. they cant help but reciprocate...

One thing to bear in mind, while you do this, is that by holding onto your anger and hurt you are still being injured by these people without any effort at all from them. you are the one giving them this power and the best and fastest way to take it away from them is to accept that what is done is done and can not be changed, put it firmly in the past and refuse to be influenced by it anymore.  Easier said than done, I know but the truth is that the people who hurt us sometimes did not mean to do as much damage as they did, they got lucky by happening to attack a weak point or open an old wound they never knew was there in the first place and if we do not put it aside they go on winning.|`|diaSqz8laa	it is so much easier to hold grudges than to just forgive and forget.

kEWknILEaa	I tried to find you an answer, but had difficulty.  I'd doubt that shinto practitioners compose more than 1% of the US population, because only people with strong ties to Japan would maintain the practice of shinto in the US.  I'm guessing that the vast majority of shinto practitioners in the US are first- or second-generation Japanese immigrants.  But your question wasn't easy to grab a quick answer to...

Everyone believes in a different God but actually its one and appears when you feel the power of inside. You will feel him talking to you when you dream from your heart , you will see him helping you when you are in trouble and could not see any solution, you will see him consoling you when you are alone.

You don't need to believe in a God to live to your fullest, all you need to believe in is yourself. You have the potential to do and experience any thing you want. Stick around...you might just like it!|`|9y4owEMyaa	Many theists have come on to this illusion that there is a single "point" or "meaning" of life when really it may be different for every person.  Some people need an imaginary friend (i.e god) to give them hope, and I'm OK with that if it helps them personally.  What I'm not okay with is the mindless idiots who just go by what their preacher says that the bible says.  But if you believe in what the bible says from reason, logic, and personal experience, then you aren't dumb at all.  And also, what is your definition of "god" anyway?  When Christians these days say god, they mean the image of god that they have created.  They don't realize that their are many other ideas about god other than their own.  They refer to people as atheists if those people don't believe in their concept of god.

be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	Doesn't that verse right there state it.       They are saying....none shall enter paradise..unless you are christian or jew. .....    and that statement is a vain desire.    Then we are suppose to say to them....show proof!.      GO back and forward verses and it'll says we don't have to take that view.      Not ALL christians and jews will go to hell.   Some christian could do something extraordinary and go to heaven...same with a jew.     its not our place to say individually you are going to hell....or heaven.     IN general though.   If christians and jews go to heaven.....then why not just dump islam?.   I mean they believe in same god / concepts....but their rules are easier to go by.    Less probability of committing sins.......... I mean Christianity is the best bet.   In christianity all christians go to heaven......just for being a christian...doesn't matter if they are a murderer or rapist...never pray...never do a single act of good in their entire life...they go to heaven.      There is 1 set of rules to go by....following any other set means you are disobeying god.    The same set of rules were given to the christians and the jews and they decided to change it.|`|RVWyPicKaa	Only Allah (swt) will be the only one to judge who will enter paradise and who will enter hell.|`|deTJcdv9aa	Nobody knows who will enter paradise and who will enter hell! only Allah knows best.  how ever i think there is a strong Hadeth that says No other religion will be accepted by god except for al islam!

If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), it will never be accepted of him...(3:85)    actually the link isn't important what is important is this number  ...(3:85)|`|OyBuEpOTaa	You can't believe everything you read. remember these books and letters were writen by people.

I always wondered if Muslim and Christianity where one in the same, but the evil ones devised a scheme to seperate us causing us to kill and hate one another.  Why is it the Semites, Muslims, and Christians all share the same Holy land?  Is it so hard to believe that Muhammad and Yeshua where both prophets of the Almighty, that this is all apart of the plan, to see if we can see past our differences and become one and have Heaven on Earth.  But yet I see sadness, despair, murder, and war, all of which are devices of the evil ones, to pull us away from our faith and the truth.  I always questioned in Church why the Almighty is referred as Him or Father, when the Almighty is neither he or she. Sorry went off topic, we should all treat one another the same and respect one another for the individuals we are, it's the only way we can begin to seek the truth.    Romans 8:19 NIV, for the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly awaits the revealing of the sons of God.    why is sons plural? we are considered the creation.  Even Heaven will pass away. summarized from Mark 13:31|`|s5M9Htfgaa	Well, its not that simple. If you are a Muslim and hurt others, kill for theft of anger or turture innocents etc, you will not see the paradise. Prophet himself was asking god for paradise and praying not to be in hell. Same for all sahabah.    Abubakr said, if i had one leg in paradise and the other out, I wouldn't guarantee I'll be there unless I act right in my live.    You can't guarantee, you might do one act that is so bad that throw you out of Islam, and a christian or a jew can become a believer of god and Mohammed at his last moment.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	Reem Habibi    be kind to those around you and show them what truly is mulim not what the media has portrayed and let our creator decide on those that enter jannah    Keep me in your duas|`|diaSqz8laa	There is only one true God. I think that the Muslims, Christians and jews all agree on that. Only that one true God can decide which of us will be going to jannah and who will not. But how we worship Him will be the deciding factor I am sure! So now, your job is to figure which is the true religion. He sent these messengers to preach the oneness of God throughout the many years. From Adam to Abraham to Moses to Jesus to Mohhamed. Find out what they all had in common and hopefully you will come to the correct answer. Let's all work hard to meet each other up there!|`|HEQc83d9aa	well done hun! all shall enter the kingdom,but I guess its down to the person and how they performed on earth.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	If paradise if full of muslims then I dont want to go their anyway.|`|hMygg8cnaa	don't worry reem.    i'll be going to a completely  different "paradise"    one without doe-eyed virgins  and fruit trees. :)|`|FhXzlnDOaa	It doesn't matter what the quran says.  I know I will not be in the islamic idea of Paradise.     Christians and Jews both believe in a Heaven on Earth.  Christians know we will be with Our Lord Jesus.  You enjoy being wherever Muhammad is and I'll gladly be with Jesus.    EDIT:  "My name is not Bruce" does not have a point.  He has no idea what Christianity is about.  If you believe you can do whatever you want and get into Heaven, you are wrong.  Christians who receive the Holy Spirit change.  We strive to become Christlike and Jesus was SINLESS.  Muslims strive to be like Mo and he was a sinner.  We have to repent of our sins - which means to never repeat them.  When you change through your faith, the good actions come naturally.  We just know we can't work our way into Heaven.  The wages of sin is death.  Jesus paid the price.  You should accept that.    EDIT  2:  This is too easy.  I could give you plenty of proof from the Bible, but you'll use the "it's corrupt" excuse.  So I'll use the quran....ok?    019.019   YUSUFALI: He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son.   PICKTHAL: He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son.   SHAKIR: He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy.     You cannot be HOLY or PURE and commit sins, can you?    EDIT  3:  You don't know Jesus.  You know Isa, who is not the same.  Jesus is Lord.  Isa is a lesser prophet than Mo.      Jesus is Holy, which means divine.  Jesus is faultless, which means irreproachable.  Jesus is pure, which means without spotless, free from guilt.  He is perfect.  He is The Christ.    EDIT  4:  Why do you believe God is so weak that He cannot become what He is not?  You believe angels can take on human form, right?  Gabriel did it according to Muhammad.  Mo pointed him out.  Are you saying Gabriel is more powerful than God?  Wow.  Good luck with that!|`|aIakDSstaa	Being separate would be paradise though|`|AA11477027	Yeah,its quite sure.

I wear mine sometimes to remind me throughout the day that Jesus paid the price for me by dying on the cross, to remind me to be an example (keep my temper, watch what I am doing, etc), and to be a testimony for others.

Neither Christ nor his apostles were thinking that the Crucifixion was "good news for mankind."    On the contrary, Christ himself said to the women who were weeping for him: "Weep not for me, but for yourself and for your own children." Somehow, the followers have interpreted that to be good news for them!!!    If you want to sort through the whole mess, this is a good resource: http://gospelengima.com    But you are right on target. The crucifixion was good news to only those who wanted to get rid of him!|`|jRcdbna5aa	There's actually a difference between a crucifix and a cross pendant.  A crucifix has Jesus on it, and is mainly (if I'm wrong, please correct me) worn by Catholics.   A cross does not have Jesus on it.    In either case, I agree with your point.  If my followers were focusing solely on the thing that killed me, I'd be kind of peeved by it.

J.W's are usually referred to as " God botherers", not because they are bothering God, but they bother people by the policy of door knocking.    But never would they wear a crucifix. Because they, we, obey this scripture...    (Exodus 20:4-5) You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. 5?You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation, in the case of those who hate me;    ...an image of anything...a form like anything....    As to the door knocking...This is done in obedience to....  (Acts 5:42) And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.  (Acts 20:20) while I did not hold back from telling YOU any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching YOU publicly and from house to house.

If a friend told be they were late for work because they missed the bus, I would not demand proof of that, it is a commonplace occurrence. If they said they were late because they had been abducted by a flying saucer, I would ask for some evidence!    And proof needs to be proportionate to that which is being proved.

Conversely, there are 'extraordinary' ideas: solutions which postulate explanations based on the introduction of a further set of ideas which have been previously unknown, or previously rejected for some other reason.    To accept such extraordinary ideas, the person proposing them would need to have amassed a more than usually persuasive collection of evidence in favour of that idea and in contrast to the accepted, ordinary explanation.    Supernatural explanations fall into this category - almost by definition since they assume something 'outside of the natural'    There is an additional form of explanation for this principle from statistics, but I suspect that it wouldn't be relevant, required or desired here, so I'll leave it in the probability books where it belongs!    ;-)|`|PD3qATQtaa	When its applied to religion this to me implies a sceptical view of having no proof to back up the notion of the existence of a God or supreme being.

6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	Honest answer? For some it is. Certain churches will refuse to marry you if they know that you cannot produce children, and marriages have been annulled for those reasons, and some do oppose infertile couples or those who desire no children to be able to marry.    For others, it isn't.    Edit: postmoderndan--yes they do. Certain baptist and non-denominational churches in my area will not marry a couple if they cannot procreate, saying they cannot truly become one flesh. Some Catholics take a similar view.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	i dont see why it is i mean    a) there are straight married couples who dont want to or cannot produce offspring  b) and their are straight people like my wifes sister who shouldnt|`|E9chZY74aa	The only place where God honors sex is in the marriage bed between a man and his wife.

I have yet to see a secular reason for not having gay marriage.  Every reason goes back to religion.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Take away everything and get to the basics...     Homosexuality is an abomination.      Lev 20:13   If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be] upon them.     Marriage is between a male and a female    1Cr 7:2   Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.      Eze 33:8   When I say unto the wicked, O wicked [man], thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.    Eze 33:9  Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.      Eze 33:11   Say unto them, [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?    God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked.  Seek truth and turn from sin and live.|`|CttXccd1aa	Of course not. You cannot expect someone who opposes gay marriage (or any other thing) on a religious base to give a secular reason to it. If it was an issue, as you say, infertile straight couples shouldn't be allowed to married. What about couples who got married then can't have children? should they be forced to divorce then? What about straight couples who do not want to have children?   I prefer people who oppose such a thing because simply by sayingthat "it's not natural" and that "maybe it's because they were raised differently" - thus leaving a space open for different opinions. At least they are honest with the apprehension they feel about it.    To Aine's Daughter: "Certain churches will refuse to marry you if they know that you cannot produce children, and marriages have been annulled for those reasons" See, it's religion all over again.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	That argument is based around the fact that the human body has parts designed for reproduction and it is those parts that are to be used together in sexual union, whether they function properly or not has no bearing on their purpose.    Homosexuality is a complete contradiction, it perverts the sexual union into something completely unnatural and involves those body parts, and other body parts, in ways totally opposed to their design and common decency.    So yes this is an issue, at least to those people that have morals and an understanding of right and wrong. This is regardless of whether the Bible approves or not.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	That is hardly a secular reason. Most of these Christians oppose even contraceptives. It's a completely religious reason.    I don't feel it should be an issue. The world is overpopulated anyway.|`|FhHklqkhaa	bigots will never be rational  many do ignore that some heteros can't reproduce  they lie that same-sex couples aren't natural and then try to redefine what the argument is|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yep. That would mean--    Women OVER 40, cannot marry!!! Since they have passed menopause and can no longer produce children. So if they marry, its just all a sham.    And INFERTILE men and women can say goodbye to marriage. Their's is also a sham and they must be divorced. Because they are really just marrying for sex not to have children, and that is obviously just immoral.    And people who marry and CHOOSE NOT to HAVE CHILDREN, should also be banned from marriage. Because again they have defied the purpose of God.    And people who marry and use CONTRACEPTION, should also be banned from marriage. Since again they are defying the will of God by enjoying sex without reproduction which is a sin. And that also goes for FELLATIO and other non-Christian sexual practises which fail to produce offspring.    So . . . if you going to ban gay marriage on the grounds of "the purpose of marriage is to reproduce" then you should be consistent right across the board..|`|AA11521494	"Homosexuality is against the will of god" - then why on earth did he allow me to be here?  If god was as powerful as Christians claim him to be then surely I would be heterosexual.  And I'm fed up with being told it's a choice - it isn't.    Of course the only reasons against gay marriage are religious ones.  Interestingly, the British House of Lords contains bishops and half of them voted in favour on the grounds that it promotes stable relationships.|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	Not being able to reproduce is not the reason.  The reason is that marriage is an institution designed by God for one man and one woman who make a covenant before God to love each other and raise their children in accordance with His teachings.  This institution is for the welfare of humanity in many ways.|`|zlHgIltOaa	Christians are simply uncomfortable with the idea of gay marriage.

I have known many people to get married in their 60's and 70's in a church with absolutely no arguments whatsoever about their inability to have children because of their age.     America needs to look to Europe, where gay marriage has been legal in most countries for years now, and see that straight people are still living perfectly happily, and there are no more gay people than before gay marriage was legalised. It's our business at the end of the day, and all of these God fearing, evangelical Christians should not be allowed to dictate to us what rights are available to us, and try to ammend the constitution to justify their homophobia.

Luke 16:22  So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.  23  And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  24  "Then he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.'      25  But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.  26  And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.'  27  "Then he said, 'I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house,  28  for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.'      29  Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'  30  And he said, 'No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'  31  But he said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.'

It was scary man, whatever it was it started talking through my friends mouth. He blacked out a few times and when he came to he was cold, pale, and sweating, with a kinda glow in his eyes, and said that he could see everything that it saw. When he was blacked out he was speaking in tongues ive never heard before. The next day we talked to a pastor at a nearby church and just calmly told us that if we went back there we were in grave danger. He bade us never to never visit that place again. He said certain places are portals to hell and some cant stray to far from that place. Demons can enter a church. Some religious people can see them, and one man said before he walked into a church and a select few had small demonic things latched onto their back and was whispering into their ears.|`|cmoGATT9aa	wow. off the acid bro.    or you have schizophrenia.    or god exists and i'm wrong.     meh who knows.    bet it scared the hell outa you any way.

When Barbour wrote an article denying the redemptive value of Jesus' sacrifice, Russell wrote an article calling Jesus' sacrifice one of the most important teachings of the Bible.  It wasn't long after that, they quit their partnership, and Russell began his own magazine called "Zions Watch Tower and Herald of Christs Presence"    Don't know about a William Miller.|`|8Ddi57v2aa	Hello, those names are unfamiliar to me but I know Charles Russell.  I have been asking God about the Jehovah's Witnesses and I have been led to interesting findings.  Well, most of them so far good.  But I have been led to the most precious of all findings that I wished I had and now I have.  I have been led to this library miles from my home and they had a book sale going on.  I was browsing the books and there 5 books all sitting and nestled together were books from the Watchtower Bible Tract and Society.  So you know that I speak the truth here is the title of the books:  The Greatest MAN Who Ever Lived  KNOWLEDGE That Leads to Everlasting Life  United in Worship of the Only True God  The Secret of FAMILY HAPPINESS  You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth  and I have found another book too, and it is, *You Can Learn From the Great Teacher*.    6 books in all.  And the best part of it is I have been blessed because the Librarian told me it was just 50 cents each.  I have been skim reading *The Secret of FAMILY HAPPINESS* and I really am liking what I am reading.  Also these books are not recent books.  Now, is it not a blessing from God?!|`|W3ptH1JCaa	William Miller is famous for using bible chronology to predict Armageddon, a practice which can also be called "eschatology". He was responsible for the "Great Disappointment", in which his followers sold all their belongings and stood on a rock in anticipation of the "end". This happened in 1843 and again in 1844. Barbour was deeply influenced by this, believing that Miller had only gotten the date wrong, not the method, and he in turn influenced Charles Russell.     It's funny how the most outspoken jw's (like desert rose) seem to know absolutely nothing about jw history.|`|97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	None at all. We are influenced ONLY by Jehovah God, and His son Jesus.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	none of them believe what JWs are preaching now.....    This is What JWs believe    Under the rule of Jesus Christ and his heavenly corulers, peace and happiness will prevail in all the earth. (Psalm 37:9-11) Those in God's memory will be resurrected and will enjoy perfect health. (Acts 24:15) By their faithfulness to God, obedient mankind will be granted what our original parents losteverlasting life in human perfection on a paradise earth.Revelation 21:3, 4.    Jehovah God never fails to accomplish what he purposes to do. Through his prophet Isaiah, he declared: "Just as the pouring rain descends, and the snow, from the heavens and does not return to that place, unless it actually saturates the earth and makes it produce and sprout, and seed is actually given to the sower and bread to the eater, so my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it."Isaiah 55:10, 11.    In the Bible book of Isaiah, we get a preview of what life will be like in the Paradise earth. No inhabitant of Paradise will say, "I am sick." (Isaiah 33:24) Animals will pose no danger to man. (Isaiah 11:6-9) People will build beautiful homes and inhabit them and will plant crops and eat to satisfaction. (Isaiah 65:21-25) Moreover, God "will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces."Isaiah 25:8.    Soon, obedient mankind will live under such blessed conditions. They "will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God." (Romans 8:21) How wonderful it will be to live forever in the promised earthly Paradise! (Luke 23:43) You can be there if you act upon accurate knowledge of the Scriptures and exercise faith in Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. And you can have confidence that it does make sense to believe in a paradise earth.

aPuUuWlLaa	All atheism entails is the lack of belief in deities. Atheists are diverse in their views on other issues and may not necessarily hold the same views on any particular issue aside from this. I happen to be an atheist who is a secular Humanist. This being a subset within the group of atheists. Humanists do have a set of positive beliefs that they subscribe to and since its a bit lengthy to type out I'll link to them below. Agnostics who just use the term agnostic I think take the position that they are undecided whether they believe a deity exists or don't believe one exists. The term agnostic though simply refers to our ability to know something and so it is not necessarily mutually exclusive with atheism. I would say for example that I could be classified as an agnostic atheist in that I don't think we can disprove deities or know for sure they don't exist in the same way we can't leprechauns. I don't personally believe that they do though or find their existence probable. One can also be an agnostic theist in that you acknowledge there is no good evidence for a deity and we can't really know but you believe on personal faith.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Since the others have provided clear definitions, I'll just say I am an atheist who is a humanist in general and a Situationist in my personal life. You'll have to check into Guy DeBord for Situationism's definition.    I know quite a few Christians who are also secular humanists, as strange as that sounds. They just aren't bound by their church rules to do this or that and help my humanist group where we welcome them.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Atheists = no belief in a deity    Agnostic = the stance of not knowing    Humanists = a ideology about creating the best values and lives for humanity.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Atheists believe there is no god(s).    Agnostics believe that the existence of god(s) is unknown or unknowable.    Humanists subscribe to humanism, a variety of ethical theory and practice that emphasizes reason, scientific inquiry, and human fulfillment in the natural world and often rejects the importance of belief in God.    The only answer it is possible to post here are the definitions, as except for these basic ideas, every atheist, agnostic, of humanist is an individual, and has individual beliefs.|`|WbaN6osZaa	"Are there any huge differences that set them apart"    Your question is flawed.  Atheism and agnosticism are not a unifying set of beliefs or a treatise on how to live.  You may as well ask if there are any differences between people who don't believe in unicorns (aunicornists) and people who claim that there is no way of proving unicorns (agunicornists)...    Secular humanists can be atheists or agnostics, pantheists, etc...|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	Humanism isn't a belief system, but rather a social outlook. Some atheists tend to be anti-theist and militant about it. I say I'm an atheist so I'm not confusing people, because I don't think it is at all probable that there is a god, but I can really be better described as a Secular Humanist. www.beliefnet.com has good basic descriptions and differentiations between about 25 major belief systems, Including atheism and secular humanism. Not sure if they have agnosticism. It's in the results of the Belief-O-Matic quiz, and you might have to take the quiz to get there, but it's a good test to take.|`|qRue8Xdraa	Is this necessary as how atheism is the only thing that ties every single atheist?|`|cO6BD3hVaa	Atheists believe there is no god and believe that evolution is why humans exist today.    Agnostics are just a curious bunch that can't make up their minds about what they want to believe in.  Most people aren't agnostic for long before they make up their mind.    Humanists aren't much concerned with the ways of gods and is actually more about ethics than anything else.    So all in all, there's not too much they share except the non-belief in god.|`|T52vXXBJaa	I like to think that it's not so much what we believe but HOW we come to the conclusions we do. For some of use little or no evidence is required to believe in an idea. For others, we need a certain amount of evidence before we consider accepting it. How much this amount is varies from person to person. Regardless of what position is taken, I think it's fair to say that our respective conclusions are the genuine ways we understand and make sense of the world.|`|yZvZEts7aa	Idk what I am. I kinda believe theirs a god, but then again i kinda dont. Theres so much science elxplaining everything. Religion is a mirage to me. Like how theres so many religions that have different beliefs, and say "If you don't worship my god or worship god the way we do then your going to hell". But how selfish are you to believe that yours is the only one, if any?|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	okey dokey. There are going to be differences and similarities in every single atheist, agnostic, and humanist. One agnostic may believe in something that another agnostic doesn't believe in. ETC. You can't peg down specific beliefs though. You could ask the same thing to Jews, Christians, Catholics.... Why are you excluding the question to only atheist, agnostics, and humanists? Why wouldn't you ask this question to all religions if you are trying to distinguish the differences and similarities apart from their belief/non-belief in God/Gods?
cTKrByOzaa	They share the same beliefs as the Jews with one distinction, they believe that the last emperor of Ethiopia Hallie Selassie I was the messiah alternatively they believe he was the second coming of Christ.    So in short it's a Judeo-Christian religion so their idea of the end of the world will be about the same as the Jewish/Christian idea.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	rastafarians i dont know     pastafarians believe it will start with a spaghetti shortage|`|NWnOTkwCaa	There are no Rastafarians.

dIjLmMYFaa	It seems to depend more on finance. No need to wait till marriage. If you have the money, you can move out at 18; if you don't, then you are always welcome to live with ur parents.   Most Turkish men who have a good job tend to move out around the age of 25, single or married.  It is not considered a good thing that u live with ur parents after 30 years of age, u r most likely thought of as a loser.|`|HiHQvqodaa	Yes, I would say that's the norm. It certainly depends on where you live - in bigger cities, bachelors are more likely to move out of their parents' house once they get a job. It depends on the age, too. If you're over 30, it will be considered a bit "odd" that you're still single and living with your parents. The older you are, the more pressure you will receive (from parents, neighbors, friends and community) to get married and move out.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Generally they live with their families till their graduation or finding a job.It's more common to live with family in rural areas.|`|1DbyDTmhaa	Its the same in my country so I think its normal

YI6kI2SCaa	In English grammar, the subject should agree with the verb, meaning if the subject would be one, it should take the -s form; & if the subject is two or more, the base form will be appropriate.    example:    1. She NEEDS something for her project  2. They NEED something to finish the project      since your subject is "getting married" then it should be the first one since you're just talking about the marriage but not marriages and you use the linking verb "is".      you should also put some punctuation marks because it'll improvise more your sentence structure.      here's the right one    GETTING MARRIED IS NICE BUT WITH THAT  ,    COMES PROBLEM.    or          rephrase it      getting married is nice but problems come afterward.

pNy8lakjaa	Sir,    Thou is  correct to keep your daughter in the dungeons as punishment. She was a silly woman who should have known better than to trick you, kind sir.  Thine's wife will have to find comfort in knowing that she is soon to give birth to a glorious son, your heir!|`|8j70Neqeaa	what is with you.|`|V8qVsKhRaa	What, did thou marry a peasant/beggar for a wife? How stupid-- I say let Chandelier rot in the dungeon and when the lad is born, take it and divorce thou wife!|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I agree with your Lordship.  May I inquire how the recent peasant hunt went?  I trust you have some new trophies on the wall of the great room?    Regarding Chandelier, I've heard the 'gators in the moat are restless and hungry.  The wench would not be missed, eh, eh, if you get the drift.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Oh you live in a Castle and you are a stupid idiot and you are tricking your wife|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Oh dear, you should kill everyone who gets in your path|`|09zVUMBRaa	Dude, your sperm made you daughter.

Today, women have the absolute right to decide if they want to keep your baby or not.. You should be thankful to her that she is keeping yours..

72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	According to a lot of experts (who has done it themselves)- no but you will have to be on your wits when you get yourself out there (since it will be a lot harder at your age).     You will need to be resourceful  You will need to be alert  You will need to know everything inside out  You will need to be creative in very demanding ways  etc.    Hope this helps|`|6t76bgS3aa	i don't think so, it's never too late|`|5AwLW1buaa	No it isn't. I'm 37 and I think I am!!!    Assuming you have kids, be open to what they tell you about what is going on with fads, trends, etc. Try to understand why they do it without scoffing.    If you mean street smart 'knowing how to handle yourself', then definitely not.    Either way, you gotta be open-minded.
6701f7106e5be82f05306047c5a9c5e8aa	An sich gerne, aber...... (ich habe andere Pl?ne)  there is always a "but" (aber) following  It means, I would love to, but....  (I have other plans)|`|94b8KImYaa	the "an sich gerne" means - in general I like to  It is kind of holding back a 100% positive anwer. It is more like: I would like to, but.........  It also kind of expresses that the meeting up is not something very important to your friend - more like a "ok" than a "yes"|`|mUK240ykaa	"an sich" : 'by/in itself' (without consideration of extraneous factors), 'intrinsically', here maybe 'in principle'|`|5d595e97fa502fc649419580494f41efaa	It's more "Actually yes, but unfortunately...xyz...I'm busy tomorrow" (or whatever...).|`|AA10982716	He'd love to, but he might not be able to (has to check his schedule, budget, or whatever).    "an sich" is like "in principle" or "as such" and "gerne" is "gladly"|`|IqUbpid6aa	The " an sich" is a kind of reservation, some holding back. It means, "yes, but"  So your friend has possibly some excuses to meet and he is not straight enough to explain himself. It certainly isn't "gladly".    Ciao
xMqgB2GDaa	Two. The infinitive verb "to be" is not needed here, because "are" is the verb being used.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	The second one. The "to be" verb is already taken care of with its present tense plural form ,"are". :)|`|QfTEYT3zaa	Two.     You don't need 'are' and 'to be'.|`|zWB3jHHPaa	second one.  but what's this for? I hope not for a high school paper.. cause eek! (=|`|TWKIuTEyaa	The second one is correct, but using 'girly' is not, unless you are writing or speaking to friends or family.    'Girly' is informal, and slang. Informalities and slang should never be used in formal writing or speech.    The correct word is 'effeminate'.|`|AA10982716	The second one is correct, but would be better expressed as  Not all gay men are girly (or effeminate).    The first one is also correct, but means    "I do require gay men to be girly."|`|3BoZZZajaa	The second one is correct.|`|d6XAz5xXaa	Two

110743ec9fa52a12f1d07ba42f208c9eaa	Pick something you can tell a story about. For example, let's say you've chosen the subject of giving blood. Don't just say "Give blood" or "Give blood for these three reasons" Tell a story of someone that you know had their life saved because someone gave blood.    Also, if you are trying to say "Here's the reasons for giving blood" Keep it down to no more than 3 reasons. If you give 1 or 2 it may not take. If you give more than 3 it's harder for them to remember.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Pick something that intrests you.  If you're intrested in what you're saying you'll grab peoples attention!   :)|`|CjPGPwNSaa	pick anything modern  that you are strongly opinionated on|`|dtnWWbvJaa	Hi! I think it will be really helpful if you choose a topic you're very familiar with. People can keep suggesting all sorts of stuff but at the end of the day, it will be a lot easier for you to express yourself if you talk about something you really know and interested in. Take a minute or two to ponder, reflect and look deep into your heart. It can be about your faith, your relations, your favorite TV show, your sport, something about your school... its history maybe (to impress your teacher... hahaha!). Good luck and God bless! Remember to look confident and keep eye contact.
24W08urlaa	Aw Imagine Me and You is adorable =)) But if you find girls kissing attractive, I would say you're at least bi-curious. Plus, you didn't mention guys once in your post. Also, you said when you see attractive girls you want to kiss them, thats usally a clear sign you're into girls. Don't worry about labeling yourself too early, just go with the flow!|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Depends how you feel in that deep. If you are that deep then that's a possible you are a lesbian.|`|okfTDJ7taa	nah everyone likes something different for their fantasy..now if you were acting them out, id have to say yes, yes that does make you lesbianish|`|2k8rFUOiaa	Sounds like you're bicurious. If you're only young, it might just be your hormones. If you want to try something with another girl, go for it, see what it's like, and don't worry about what other people think. Just be yourself!
zFsTSrOcaa	Your dad is racist.  It wasn't until 1967 that the Supreme Court declared laws against mixed marriage unconstitutional (Loving vs. Virginia), and some people are still offended by it.    And in a sense, sticking to one race *is* like marrying your cousin.  Genetic diversity is good for a species; and the concept of "hybrid vigor," in which the offspring of a mixed cross is more fit than either parent, is well known.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	cockblocker :/    go with the girl you like and dont listen to people|`|cRz31MlMaa	Your dad is a racist you just go on with your own thinking we are all human love knows no boundaries colour does not exist. It is hard for me to comprehend racism in todays multicultural society your father is living in ignorance in the dark ages. Whites are the most colorful of all.  Red when we burn  Brown when we tan  Green when we are jealous  Blue when we are cold  Purple when we bruise  Yellow when we are sick  Crimson with rage  and Grey when we are dead. So who has the most colour?|`|YSmfrb2Taa	He's racist, plain, simple...  That's the very ideal that hitler used to gain power.  Tell your father there was a time when a irish man would never have dated an italian girl, or a swede, or a brit, and any other combo you want to think of.  Remember, the Irish were thought of as a lower people for a long time in America, same with each other group from Europe as they started to immigrate.  So remind your dad that he's already "unpure" and he should relax.     You date who you like, and let that be that.|`|lXOjqvcPaa	LOL @ ol dirty bingo!  Date her if you love her or like her don't be racist like your low class dad race mixing is a wonderful thing|`|oMF6bXCZaa	No you are not wrong, because that is exactly what he is.  Please, Please do not follow in his footsteps.  The world has changed a lot regarding accepting of other ethnic backgrounds, but whilst there are people like your father, who has this hate thinking deep into his brain, all you can do is not follow in his footsteps.    I commend you.  I feel sorry for your Dad because he will never know how interesting everybody in this world is.  I have two black sons (adopted from birth) who are now wonderful men with their own beautiful family.      Keep making the choices that you are, accepting everyone, no matter their ethnic background, and you will find that your life will be a much happier one than your father.   Hate begets hate/
xL6zc0bOaa	I think they are all having a good old laugh at us.    The troubled Royal Bank of Scotland, rescued with 20 billion of public money, is planning large bonuses for thousands of its City traders and senior bankers, The Times has learnt.     The proposed payments are expected to reach tens of millions of pounds  possibly hundreds of millions  with some star bankers in line for six-figure payouts.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	This sounds like the USA and everyone is paying for their luxuries!!!  I guess over here they think we may have another "Farm Aid" and pull them out like they did Willie!!!|`|IS7Xubkfaa	It is strange how that works.     If you are at the bottom and dont perform you get fired. But if you are at the top and the company does badly you get a bonus. The reason is that the best help requires the best pay and the best help is always at the top. (Cream rises to the top.) It is called the high mucky-muck station.     In public or private if you are a high Mucky-Muck, you are the celebrated lofty prominent very important person of high esteem. You can make mistakes and never worry about harsh punishment. You are Gods chosen one to lead the masses and should be very highly compensated for your lofty position of being at the top.|`|f0850578f9cb1b6e79940540e6c2eacfaa	It really depends on what a worse job is?  The Government wants the Banks to continue to lend, whereas from the banks point of view it would be more prudent to stop lending.    Therefore, the Government pays large bribes to the bankers to continue to run the banking system into the ground,  a new graduate would not be so easily and quickly corrupted by greed.    Besides, the if RBS can lose 25 bn a year, what is a few million pounds?      If they did not pay them the bonuses, they would easily get a job in another bank!|`|g0gMQUCVaa	*Terrie banging her head on the wall*|`|AqLwmafOaa	They are robber barons .... and SHOULD be doing jail time.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Legitimate yes.  Realistic. No way.  Same in RSA.  Laying of staff at the same time as boss's bonus day.  Peace.|`|FD8I4zthaa	The bonuses are for staff working in sound, profitable sections of the Banks.|`|jjt2enntaa	I think if these top executives, both in UK and USA ,were men and women of integrity, they would graciously refuse the bonuses until the economy was back on it's feet, and people were no longer losing their jobs and homes.    HA!  I realize that's wishful hoping.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Just what do you have to do to get your bonus limited to half a million dollars?   These are the people who got us into the mess we're in. If they have not actually participated in criminal acts then they've come pretty close, through incompetence, greed or ignorance.  If I don't do my job correctly, then I can expect to be fired for incompetence, and in such a case, I would not be entitled to redundancy pay, a golden parachute or a bonus.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Same in the states. What has happened to us all?|`|FGCjgc8Raa	Disgusting! They get bonuses for being the very ones who got us in this financial mess, rewarded for screwing the citizens of the USA, rewarded for doing a crooked job. "HOW ABOUT THAT"!  jeez.  I cannot believe I typed this I "never" use the S word or shout, but it is TRUE.  If my husband were here he would be laughing at me, he really enjoyed it when I would really get mad about some thing.

lNeDc5q2aa	You know the answer .  JD book chapter 14.  A blessing until there is no more want.  Ours is a time of judgment & of blessing . It is a period of religious decay & of spiritual restoration . Surely you should want the blessing as well as the present & future good effects of the spiritual restoration.  How can you be assured of these .  See Malachi 3:1 (also 2 Tim 3:1)  With out going into too much detail Spiritual refinement is a part of spiritual restoration .    edit  Insurrection Rebel ,the atheist had a very good guess .(better than some christians i think)|`|4hsl2toNaa	I do like Rebels answer.      To refine is to make something better, stronger.  Jehovah wants us to benefit ourselves and he is the one helping us.  He wants all to attain to everlasting life and this is his way.  Jehovah is also wise enough to know not all will come to him.  Those who do and are willing to submit and endure will benefit greatly from the Creator.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Spiritual refinement simply means that as you grow in the peace of your connection to God you better accept the world and everyone in it as exactly the way they should be. You eventually see that God did not make mistakes in creating you or me or anything. Don't set out to change the world or those in it. As your spirit is refined your perspective changes and only in that sense does the world change for you.|`|OhhKRahTaa	I don't know.|`|ppX0xoeFaa	Make your mind fresh & try to keep longer time.  When you endure everything,you are a fool.  When you have a chance to recover your spiritual state in the peaceful condition,you can find yourself in it.  You will meet yourself in your deep soul very finely.  You will meet yourself & it`s you the God in you.  Take care always with the God in you.|`|8zear6ttaa	I would think it is going beyond knowing the basic tenants of your religion. I found it important to me to learn what famous people say about their religion.. I am a Christian but am reading the Dalai Lama's book   Daily Advice From the Heart. I read religious mystical poetry especially by Hafiz, I read about archeological finds relating to religion, I listen to modern religious music. One I epecially like are those by Steve Curtis Chapman on U Tube.I feel all this enriches my soul and expands my mind. Also it gives me a greater appreciation of God.|`|UOBvuImUaa	I would assume it would me to come to a more accurate knowledge of the bible & God , also maybe to stand strong enduring tests of faith .
9df77ae12f17971731e9883919813c91aa	no, absolutely not.    if you feel the need to apologize then your religion of choice isn't the right one for you.      my thoughts.|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	No, but I don't think it hurts to explain your reasons for choosing the religion if a person seems to not approve, especially if you care about that person and what they think of you.    I know a lot of people feel they shouldn't have to explain themselves or their choice of religion. However, when there is obviously a misunderstanding, it is only wise to communicate with the other person so they can have a better understanding of what you really believe.|`|wjCJhxPZaa	Should people who are miraculously healed, apologise to people who don't even have a health care card?|`|dvY6UfiYaa	Never. If you're going to believe in magical invisible fairies then at least have the balls to be unapologetic.|`|89MKzLl3aa	If you apologize for your religion you are implying that you are wrong. Be faithful, but don't push it in other people's faces.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	The ignorant wouldn't be aware enough to know they should be apologetic.|`|AA11521494	Absolutely not.  If it means anything to you, why should you be apologetic?  And I say that as a follower of the most misunderstood "religious" way of life there is.|`|bYDVTv7Maa	No.    Why should somebody be sorry for believing in something?|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	I don't see the parallel with the maps, but then what's important is the terrain. No, you shouldn't be apologetic. Apologising means you think whatever it is you're apologising for isn't up to standard.    Neither should you be arrogant about your choices. They are, after all, choices. If you have the right to choose, so does everyone else, even if they choose differently.|`|AA10849738	no.  if you are a religous person and beleive in god all you need to do is pray and ask God to show lyoul the way.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	To believe in God or in a guiding force because someone tells you to is the height of stupidity. We are given senses to receive our information within. With our own eyes we see, and with our own skin we feel. With our intelligence, it is intended that we understand. But each person must puzzle it out for himself or herself.
ccZuEOEfaa	I don't know about regular cats, but I think my cats epic failed the "Keeping An Eye on the Devil" class in cat school.  They're too darn lazy!|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Something the Jews borrowed from Egypt?    Bastet, the cat-goddess, was a daughter of Osiris and sister of Horus. The evil god Seth (the Devil) chopped up Osiris and raped Horus, and her mother Isis wandered the land as a prostitute.  So I guess Bastet's cats were assigned to keep an eye on the devil (followers of Seth) because of the horrors her family suffered.    And the Jews thought the story was cool, so snapped it up too.|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	Trying to be smart, aren't we?|`|Ys5fxV1faa	By closing the other eye. That is why a one eyed cat looking into a sea food store cannot sin.     Did you know that cats were mentioned in the bible in several places most particularly in the Letter of James of the New Testament. Cats were also mention in the OT in 2 Macabees. Did you know why they are not there now?     I all started with the reformation. There were 5 points on which were called the hinge of the reformation Sola Scriptura, Sola Fede, The Universal Priesthood of all believers, that all Personal interpretations were valid and lastly Cate ileminate, which means that Cats were evil and should be eliminated from the bible. After extensive communication Luther's doctrine on cats was adopted by the Catholic Church. It was the one thing everyone could agree on. Two centuries later the Orthodox Church followed. As more and more Protestant denominations formed none returned cats to their original place in the bible except for the Jehovah Witnesses. Who seem to take them in and out every year or so. The Mormons likewise also put them back in only to later remove them when one of their leader's had a "new " revelation. It didn't create much of a stir because Most Christians don't consider Mormons to be Christians anyway.    Information regarding changes in the OT are shrouded in even more mystery. It is said in one of the Jewish apocryphal books there is a story of David. It is said he was repairing the drain under a kitchen sink. He was not wearing any clothes. A cat came up behind him. Well I think you know how the rest goes. After the incident David had them removed from the Psalms where they once had a prominent  place. The last Psalm was dedicated to cats. It was the 151st Psalm. As I am sure you know there are only 150 psalms now. He also had them removed for the Story of Creation where it is said that there was a story of a cat in a tree. The original story as it was lost in time.     It's really all about cats since the very beginning....
C1SOqQSkaa	Gee - from the answers you're getting, it must be almost as frustrating for you fundamentalists to get a point across to lumpenChristians as it is for us infidels!    Anytime you're ready to drop the deity stuff, there's a welcome for you among us heathen.|`|AA11232725	John 3:14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15  that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.    John 10:17  "Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.  18  No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father."    Luke 24:25  Then He said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!  26  Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?"  27  And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.    Matthew 20:28  just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."    Matthew 26:27  Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.  28  For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.    Matthew 26:51  And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  52  But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.  53  Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?  54  How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?"|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You are provably wrong. THIS is what we know that they thought :    ACTS 2  22     Jesus the Nazorean was a man commended to you by God with mighty deeds, wonders, and signs, which God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.  23      This man, delivered up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God, you killed, using lawless men to crucify him.    See...just read the Bible once, just maybe the Gospels and Acts and you won't say such stupid things.    Commended by God..set plan and foreknowledge of God -- now could it be clearer.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	You are missing the point. The Crucifixion of Jesus alone would be very, very bad news. The overall story of Christ, though, (birth, ministry on Earth, death, resurrection, ascension into Heaven) is GREAT news!     Everything that Christ did on Earth was done so that we can gain eternal life, therefore everything He did is a part of the good news of the Gospel.|`|7cLYgf2raa	You are leaving out the rest of the story. Jesus was raised from the dead to head up a reborn race of man, freed from sin, sickness, demons and fear. THAT is the good news.WE do not see Jesus hanging on a cross, but sitting on the right hand of majesty on high. Do not feel sorry for Jesus, he is doing just fine.|`|rTplTuEdaa	Have you not read in the bible  that ,,that was why Christ came to earth  in the first  place,,God sent him here to die for mankind  and  Jesus gave his life ,they did not take it,he could have called  ten thousand angel,s  to set him free,but he stayed on the cross for you and for me.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	Jesus death was planned from the foundations of the earth, He came knowing that He would have to suffer and die for mankind.  His kingdom is here it is in each one of us as believers, but without His death we would have no way to enter into His kingdom. Christ did die for our sins and by His stripes we are healed. God requires a blood sacrifice to remove our sins with the animal sacrifices the sins were only covered not removed and therefore had to be repeated over and over. When Jesus died He died once for all and His blood removes our sin it doesn't cover it so it has to be repeated, but it REMOVES our sin so we can enter the presence of the Lord at any time without fear.  This was the Good news that we now have a way to be in relationship with God the Father through the work of the Son Jesus. Without His sacrifice we would still be killing lambs, goats, doves, and cows to cover our sins. You must be LDS. Sorry you are not LDS, just listening to false teachings.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	It would take a while for those who knew Jesus personally, to realise that's what Jesus was here for, to die for our sins..     Like a soldier that dies in combat, the bereaved wont come to terms with it until they realise its a soldiers job to keep the peace and protect his country and his fellow soldiers, regardless of the ultimate costs..     Its a shame but that's just the way it is..|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Sometimes it takes "historical perspective" to appreciate the value of an event.Whether Jesus died for our sins or not doesn't make all that much difference.Jesus did nothing but teach love ,peace and truth throughout His life.He was the embodiment of the prophesies of the old Testament. He was and is the son of God as we all are.The truth of this lies within you. Your spirituality is your connection to God and everything He wants for you in this life. Man's interpretation of Jesus's teachings are mostly self serving by the very churches that are supposed to be true to His word. Look into yourself for the truth. The kingdom really is within you.|`|zHwlGhIAaa	How can you say Christ did not look at his crucifixion as good news?  Christ told his follower not to try to help him and not to fret for him.  He knew from the moment he came onto this earth what his purpose was for being here.  He served no other purpose in flesh then to spread the gospel and die for our sins.  He knew that he would die and he knew he would rise again. I mean all of that scholarly stuff is just that, it's not  the word, the Bible that a true believer stands on.  A true believer knows that Christ had to die in the physical sense for our sins.  But he is not dead in the spiritual sense.  There is nothing for a believer to be sad about when it comes to Crucifixion.  Christ came down to shed his blood so that we might have life and have life more abundantly.  God is still working on helping many people realize that he only wants us to have the life that he intended for us however we have become so wrapped up in this secular world we can't even bear to believe that a lifestyle pleasing to God is beneficial and not restrictive.  But he will continue.|`|AA10166652	You are reading it out of context, my friend. Jesus knew what He was doing.....and what it was for. That's why He did it. He even cried out for the Father God to forgive those people for what they were doing, because they were spiritually blind....He said "Father, forgive them; they don't know what they're doing!"     Christ's enemies believed crucifying Him was a good idea, because they wanted to make a spectacle of the man who they believed proclaimed himself to be the Messiah....it was all about pride and the fear of losing their power. Their motive was driven by hatred, pride and fear....they had no idea they were accomplishing a prophesy.    When Saul went around persecuting the Christians, he believed he was doing it FOR God....he was spiritually blind, at that time. Then, in Acts 9:3-22, we read that Saul gets a visitor, and was physically blinded (physical manifestation of spiritual blindness, in this case) before being filled with the Holy Spirit and becoming a Born-again Believer. His name was then changed to Paul.    Believers KNOW it was a good idea........because through that beating, death and resurrection, all human-kind has the opportunity to be reconciled back to a relationship with God, the Father.    Romans 5:10  Even when we were God's enemies, he made peace with us, because his Son died for us. Yet something even greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, we will be saved by his Son's life.      Jesus preached the Kingdom......and told us to "Go and preach the good news to everyone in the world." That's what Paul (not Saul) was doing. The "good news" is that by receiving Christ as your Savior, you are no longer bound to the law of sin and death.....you are FREE!! You don't have to struggle on your own, through life; you don't have to be sick, anymore, either. And you will live an eternity in Heaven!      Sounds like good news to me!!!    ?|`|i6sNYmiMaa	I agree with Anberlin. The "Good News" was that God sent His only begotten Son that whoever believed in Him should not perish but have everlasting life in Heaven. Jesus knew that He was sent to die for all of us! He stated it many times in the Bible. So "killing a teacher sent by God was not good news for mankind" is the wrong statement if you study the Word of God.|`|rtFkwelQaa	Christ is the Son of God.  He was sent to this earth to die for our sins.  If He did not do that we would have no chance of having eternal life.  That's why it is good news for Christians.  The Bible does not say that Jesus thought that His death was not good news.  Yes, He did ask if the cup would pass from Him.  It was part of His humanly nature to feel that way.  But He also ultimately knew that in order to save us sinners that He had to go through with it, or we would all be lost.|`|wWL934E8aa	There had to be death before Resurrection could occur.  The good news is the gospel which Paul defines in 1Corinthians 15:3-4 (just like Faith is defined in Hebrews 11:1 and Love is defined in 1 Corinthians 13)|`|EAuMJrs4aa	they twisted it like every other aspect of the message|`|89MKzLl3aa	The Good News refers to Salvation through Jesus Christ.

Xg1ZR4ptaa	Some green tea plz. DRINK|`|yHfsHp6naa	Because they secretly want to know the truth.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God or Jesus. The Bible is fiction.|`|89MKzLl3aa	Why do atheists still come here?    when they know Christians don't want them to?    The road goes both ways.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Several reasons should come to mind. First, because Jesus commands you to: "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit," (Matt. 28:19). Also, Ezek. 3:11 says, "and go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not..."        Second, you must witness because you love the unsaved (if you don't, you should). The most loving thing you can do is present the gospel in hopes of bringing others to salvation. Galatians 5:22 lists love as one of the fruit of the Spirit. It is love's nature to give. Take for example John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son..." Love gives, and if you have only a small portion of His love, you will want to give to others.         Third, witness because it is a wise thing to do. Prov. 11:30 says, "...he who is wise wins souls." Now, I know I am not a very wise person. But, since God says I'll be wise to win souls, or try to, then great, let me at it. I want to be wise in God's sight.         Fourth, witness to keep people out of hell. Hell is a terrifying place of utter anguish and eternal separation from God. Those who are not saved go there. Witnessing is an attempt to keep them out of hell.        Fifth, witness because it pleases God and brings glory to His name.         And finally, witness so they may find the love and fellowship of God (1 John 1:3), the greatest of all treasures. I can think of no greater gift than salvation. It frees the sinner from sin, it delivers the lost from damnation, and it reveals the true and living God to those who don't know Him.         The angels of heaven rejoice greatly when anyone passes from judgment into salvation (Luke 15:10). Shouldn't we as Christians rejoice too? Shouldn't we weep over the lost? Shouldn't we ask the Lord of the field to send laborers into His harvest (Luke 10:2)? Certainly! The salvation of others is the goal of your efforts. The love of God is your motive. Is there anything greater? So, give.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	You got your own Religion NOW get your own category|`|4b0017b6f1d17e1bc52f602c5a3f0a30aa	I like playing with monkeys.|`|kmAMgkiraa	That question can be reversed in a way.

wKV4eNk1aa	because out fo the 8 million jews in europe 6 million were killed  even though other groups lost millions of ppl too,  they didn't end up loosing almost 70% of their total population|`|3QIoa38Naa	They're Jews...|`|X5hTmAkBaa	or point out that it was Jewish communists who were responsible for killing 10-20 million people in soviet Gulagh camps. You can go look up all the top leading communists back then and they're practically all Jewish. This is one thing that is never mentioned when people want to find out why hitler targeted jews or why they've been persecuted for so long... focusing and bombarding people with the Jewish holocaust leads focus away frm the Jews role in rise of bolshevism, communism and genocide of russians. Being able to pull the "holocaust card" is one of the most powerful weapons they have and even jews have said it themselves.    "The only two non-Jews in the communist conspiracy were Chambers and Hiss...Every other one was a Jew and it raised hell with us."   - US President Nixon, 1971|`|QGuxbItCaa	Time to move on...it is old history.|`|NEJgU0BNaa	because they only care about themselves|`|AA11969509	I have seen and/or read many books, movies, etc about the Holocaust and Jewish writers do mention other people who were killed in concentration camps.  However, they do concentrate on the Jewish experience because they are Jewish.  Russian accounts stress the number of Russian POW's killed.  Jehovah's witnesses like to talk about the Jehovah's witnesses that were killed.    P.S.  Some of the early Russian leaders, such a Trotsky, were Jewish atheists.  However, most of them were killed off or deposed by Stalin, who was antisemitic.  You can't blame Stalin's atrocities on Jews.  Certainly Jews such as Trotsky did kill people, so some Jews were murderers.  But it is ridiculous to try to paint Jews as particularly prone to mass murder.

God bless.|`|AA11232725	God knows what's going on in your heart.    Hebrews 4:12  For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  13  And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.  14  Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.  15  For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.  16  Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.    Still, if you have anxiety and fear, you should not presume to think that since God already knows what it going on, you don't have to do your part and speak to Him in prayer. He tells us in the above passage to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.    You come before the throne in prayer.     Philippians 4:6  Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;  7  and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  8  Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy--meditate on these things.    If you are having mental confusion then you might want to consider seeing a doctor. It could be that you have a chemical imbalance or some other condition that can be treated by doctors whom God has given wisdom to in order that people can be cured.     God can cure by miraculous means but you don't want to test God by demanding a miracle when He has already provided another way to help you get better.|`|AA10249608	I am sorry for what you are going through,Yes God is waiting for your call to Him.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	God will hear.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God or Jesus.

Fortunately this is coming to an end very shortly. 2012 will see in the new age of Aquarius which will ultimately have a much better view of things. An evolutionary water shed point, tempered by fire and tribulation.   This is the culmination of us, all matter and energy, as our beliefs come full circle back to its roots and true state of being. Which is a spiritual being whose frequency has become dense enough to manifest as matter. Not a physical body with spiritual aspirations.     All matter is an energy vibrating at a particular dense frequency. That includes us. We have to follow the same laws of physics as all other matter does.

4s31OKf5aa	I completely agree, why is it ok for the newspapers and organisations to immediately blame teenagers. If you read an article in the paper about some tyres being slashed and the police don't have a SINGLE CLUE about who did it they will say, "We suspect it was teenagers". If they said, "We suspect it was a black person" they would have hell to pay!    There was also a time when I went swimming in a pool on holiday. They had 2 spa baths, one for younger kids, and one for adults. 1st one: "Up to 12 year olds only", 2nd one, "21 and up only". So what about the people in between the ages of 12 and 21? Ridiculous!    How about this one? At 16 you pay an adult ticket for most things. However you don't have a 1/2 decent minimum wage until the age of 18. How is that fair?

KS2OHXCRaa	Could you try to persuade the course coordinator to make an exception? Afterall you're now trying to make an effort to learn another language, and shouldn't a motivated and eager student be given a chance at this course? While you regret the lack of emphasis in the importance of a second language in your country of origin, you really don't want to lose this opportunity. Explain that, and maybe they'll understand.    Also, if you can't take this particular course (even after you present your case), are there other beginners language classes that you can perhaps take?    It is true that in Europe and many other countries, a foreign language or second language learning is pretty much the norm. I am very glad that I've been exposed to multiple languages while growing up, and after moving to Europe I also learned additional languages here. I'm no expert nor terribly fluent in all of them, but they certainly serve me very well when I travel. With a little adaptations from one language to another, it's amazing how much one can do.    In worse case scenario, now that you know what you want, you could always look for lessons that don't cost a bomb like Rosetta. While it is true that learning a language in a class is more effective, don't write off learning through podcast/internet sites etc, because every little information learned counts. You could also arrange for language exchange with other students, and this is usually free while you and another student get to help one another.    Good luck and enjoy your exchange in Denmark.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	That is totally unfair - I feel really sorry for you and I hope that you get into the class eventually.  Here in Australia I started learning a second language at school when I was 8, but no one takes it seriously and I didn't actually learn anything new until I was 16.  However, I'm now starting uni and I'm doing Italian as my major because I love languages and words.  So I really hope that you'll get the opportunity to find the same enjoyment in language that I have.  And you should write to Barack Obama about it - he seems like a pretty smart guy and I'm sure he values education more than the average American.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	I agree with you in principle.  I had to wait till university to learn another language.  Depending on where you live, the choices your school may offer are pretty lame.  However, don't blame America.  Do it yourself.  You can use the internet, the public library, and any nearby university library.  These days with Skype and Facebook, etc.  You can find someone in the world who would be willing to speak Danish with you, say, once a week or so.  I know being in class is ideal, but if you really want to do it, you can find the motivation to do it yourself.    I think your desire to learn a language is very admirable, and it will pay off in the future, when you have more job opportunities than your peers. Best of luck to you.|`|GQut9Jpuaa	1. Many Americans are full of themselves.   2. Because schools run on property taxes, many cannot afford foreign language programs.   3. Too many Americans don't value education or culture.     I agree with you. I think it's stupid too and will also raise my kids to know at least two languages.|`|7vnTMsukaa	Only two languages dominate the entire North America (three if you count French), so it's not necessary to offer more than that.      However, if public schools suddenly find themselves with the extra money to teach more languages, they should offer Navajo and other Native languages.  The priority should be to preserve the cultures and languages of their own continent first, then move onto the less dominant languages of Europe (ex: Danish).      What do you think of that, nebula-smoothie?|`|0b27c16dd325e2296a8900a92d1cba9faa	I took 4 years of German in jr high/high school, plus 2 in college, that was enough for me to be fluent.     I spent my senior year as an exchange student in Sweden, so I learned Swedish before the trip. Once you know German, Swedish is much easier.  But I didn't get much practice because everyone spoke English so much! TV shows, movies, music, were all in English. Sure classes were in Swedish, but English was seen as cooler or something.     I think the difference between Europe and the US is that in the US, you're not exposed to many other languages, except for Spanish in the Southwest. Overseas, there's so much more need to speak different languages, since most countries are the size of a US state.     Immigration is changing the need to know foreign languages in the US. Where my kids attend school, 25% of the kids are native spanish speakers, so they've picked up a lot of Spanish without being taught. And that's the best way to learn it.     Plus, in California, they have quite a few charter elementary schools that are taught half in English and half in Spanish. That way, both the English speakers and Spanish speakers become bilingual.     There are many options for learning languages, but US schools have different priorities. There are so many other subjects to learn. Time devoted to learning a language in primary school takes away from other subjects.|`|8Dt2Z7fiaa	Because ENGLISH is a very common language. Used in more countries than any other language I think. Therefore there is no other language that is so helpful people insist it is taught. It's up to the parents and children to seek other languages. Plenty of Americans, New Zealander, Australians and English people peak more than on language.    Learning 2 languages works best when both languages are used in the home from a young age so if you're parents aren't bi lingual it's hard for them to teach you another language. It's never too late though, if you want to learn another language do it. Take classes, travel, watch foreigne movies, download free programs...|`|gFBDcfQGaa	I agree with you. As a Venezuelan citizen, I have never understood that resistance of the US people and educational authorities about  learning foreing languages.  People all over the world love to learn languages others than their own.  About your case, remember, nothing is too hard if we try. Search for danish friends on the web. They are lovely people.|`|AA11606327	I'd rather have them require that foreigners who move here learn English. I'm tired of hieroglyphics and multi language signs all over the place and babbling people who can't make themselves understood.    As far as students learning a foreign language, it is good if they have the opportunity. The opportunity should be required, but not the enrollment. To many students in this country can't even read or write English. We need 100% literacy in English before that should even be considered.
4Zbjx8bCaa	Some Angels have subordinate Angels yes.    There is a hierarchy of angels, it's so fun to look at and memorize and the paintings are beautiful.    Seraphim, Cherubim etc. The names are awsome and the descriptions are awsome, like a baby with wings, I mean its messed up but awsome and weird in that sense. I think awsome means strange and wonderful at the same time.    Like the Joker, or the descriptions of Laozi and other Taoist Masters who had four heads, or 9 nipples and blue biceps or 4 eyes etc.    Awsome.|`|CGqbPfdnaa	Huh?

I was in Holland recently and they sell lots of stuff called angel this and angel that. I thought that was kind of cool that you could by all this angelic stuff.    But actually Angel was just their word for English, you-know as in Anglo-Saxon.    So, as an Anglo-Saxon, I think I must also be an Angel. And no, I don't have any odd angles either, just curves.|`|xF8TvlhYaa	Don't catch your point. Explain more.    Angels,Deva doot, etc., are common in all mythologies. Angel have no legs?

Does that username represent your success in school?|`|q0q2Ej1Oaa	Angels are not flat unlike the Earth, which has 4 corners|`|sQsjm3eAaa	i think they have.  someone who helps us in bad time is angel  and they are people of this world only.........     if they get help in bad time ........they also got angel|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	Angles need no other angels because they are close to God, have eternal bliss and their wills are fixed for doing good. On the other end are the fallen angels, those who rebelled against God and were banished from heaven. Their wills are also fixed, but for evil.
CDsLUCXUaa	his problem just as long he's a good president he could consider him self a tele tubby|`|08fd152ff50116f01097dabf1ac378c7aa	His father died in a car accident. He would have eventually returned to obama had he not died. His mother had a good view of him and taught obama about him. He dumped his g/f because it was not working. He married the first lady because he wanted some of that loving lol. Here is the thing. You can't be white unless you are all white. You can't be black unless you are all black. Just because you have a lousy dad doesn't mean he does.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	What kind of question is this? He identifies himself as a black man because that is how he is seen and because he was raised by his white family shouldn't have anything to do with who he decides to marry white, black green etc. Just because his father and your father abandoned you doesn't mean that you should abandoned the other half of yourself. Unlike you Obama acknowledges both sides of his heritage but defines himself as black because he looks black and people define him as black regardless if he is biracial. When you take a look at him he looks like a black man. I think its sad that you ignore your other half, it still doesn't change the fact that you are biracial. the end    EDIT: there is no such thing as a "one drop rule" we are not talking about paint here we are talking about a human being every time someone mentions this ridiculous rule it just adds to the ignorance in the world.    Sandy: you can give me a thumbs down I could care less. It still doesnt change the fact that you seem to be ignorant according to your question and the fact that the truth hurts when it is brought to your attention. I hope you become more mature and learn that not every black person is not your father|`|DkgrDbCvaa	You consider yourself a white woman..... (0-0) I'd feel like a idiot saying i'm white when i am obviously not... The same goes with being black. That's why i say i am mixed race.    See it's people like you who make every other mixed race person look ignorant, and have race and self esteem issues.    I don't think Obama looks like a black man, he looks mixed race. You take a walk around Africa and you show me one 100% black person who looks like Obama. Same skin colouring and hair facial featues. He is not black, he is mixed race. Unlike you, he doesn't have issues that's why he's gone out with someone he likes as opposed to you, despertely trying to restore the white gene.|`|yynC47EMaa	You must be very young.   Ohhh give it some time dear, those white boys and white girls will soon remind you in many ways that you are not one of them as their parents will teach them. fter you learn that painful lesson, you  will rediscover your black side and come back to the people who will accept you... it's an old but familiar story.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	I'm sure that Obama identifies with black Americans because my guess is that in the 60's and 70'sm (just as today) a kid with brown skin and an afro got treated like any other black kid. People usually don't care about who your family is, you get treated based on first impressions. You do understand that as much as you want to be white your white friends and white boyfriends see you as 1/2 black? That's fine, because it's the truth.    You can consider yourself white all that you want to and be angry at the "black" half of you. But it doesn't change who you really are. So, you don't get along with part of your family. Welcome to the world. Like it or not, they are still a part of you.|`|DUicCMGFaa	Well Obama was raised in American society where they practiced the one drop rule, which makes him a black-man & he doesn't even looked mixed.So in the eyes of a stranger he would be treated the same way as black people are END of!! he still would have had to sit at the back of the bus!!! drink from the separate water fountain!! there wasn't a middle seat.    Too really find out more about his identity you should read his book, The dreams of my Farther. He pretty much explains his identity there.

Who by the way never had a down fall. archaeologists are discovering new artifacts all the time proving the accuracy of the Bible.   So for your questions, Christianity was started by Christ. Although He never wanted a religion, only believers in Him.   God created the Bible. It is His word. And it is how we know His word and that it is always true and that God is sovereign to His promises.   Jesus has always been around. If you would like to know what led to His coming here, start in Genesis.|`|rTplTuEdaa	The Bible is historical,,you can learn all you want from it     it tell,s the birth of Jesus ,some of his childhood,his     teaching,s and his death and Resurrection.|`|89MKzLl3aa	(The historical view is the biblical view. If you want more go to a library)    Christianity began after Jesus' Resurrection, when He commissioned Peter and the other Apostles to spread the Word. The bible is a collection of ancient books that were canonized. The books of the New Testament includes the Gospels-written by those who knew Jesus personally and followed Him, the Epistles are a collection of letters to new churches, most of which were written by Paul.    Jesus is the picture and was charged as a criminal and crucified. The spread of Christianity began after His Resurrection.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	When did it start and by whom?  "In the beginning, God"    Who created the Bible and why? and when     Moses wrote the first 5 chapters and the prophets afterwards added to it when inspired by God to add to it.  God gave Moses the 10 commandments first.  Go to this website for the King James Bible - English Bible  www.av1611.org/attack.html    How did Jesus come into the picture and become a prominent figure in the time and what caused His down fall?  From Genesis to Revelation the Bible is all about Jesus the Christ our Lord, Savior and God.  Jesus has never fallen down and never will.  He went to the Cross of Calvary for you and me.  To take sin away a sinless sacrifice was needed and Jesus was the only man that could do it.  Only God is sinless.  See God set the rules of nature and the rules of mankind.

Genesis , God told the devil He would send One who would put His foot on His head and strip him of the authority Adam just gave him.That is Jesus. The rest is history.|`|JmVP5ECQaa	Well the Bible is Historical; so you have no choice; but get a bibical stand point view. It was at antioch that the disiples of christ was called christians.. why? Because they were doing everything Jesus was doing: healing,teaching,preaching,and casting out demons.    Anipus was the one who created the bible.. he was the only one who was able to translate the books from hebrew. You see Jesus was always in the picture he is GOD.    Since the fall of Man God already had a plan and although it took a long time for it to manifest it happen. He came to save man from Gods wrath that will be pour out on judgment day. Thats why we always quote John 3:16 For God so loved the world; that he gave his only begotten son, and those who believe in him shall not parish; but have eternal life. God loved us so much that he does not want us to go to hell...  For Hell was not ment for man; but for satan and his angels; but since man hates God, and rather sin and not follow or obey his laws that hell has open it's mouth even wider.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Ok..    Early ChristianityA Way of Life    Jesus said to his followers: You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you. (John 15:14) Since Jesus teachings affected all aspects of their lives, Christs disciples initially referred to their religion as The Way. (Acts 9:2) Soon thereafter, [they] were by divine providence called Christians. (Acts 11:26) This new name they bore meant that they believed that Jesus was the Son of God, who had transmitted to mankind the will of his heavenly Father. This belief led them to follow a way of life that differed from that of the world around them.    Christs teachings moved his followers to follow Bible teachings, which meant avoiding fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, . . . drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these. (Galatians 5:19-21; Ephesians 4:17-24) The apostle Paul reminded Corinthian Christians that some of them had once practiced these very things. Then he added: But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.1 Corinthians 6:9-11.    E. W. Barnes relates in his book The Rise of Christianity: In its early authoritative documents the Christian movement is represented as essentially moral and law-abiding. Its members desired to be good citizens and loyal subjects. They shunned the failings and vices of paganism. In private life they sought to be peaceful neighbours and trustworthy friends. They were taught to be sober, industrious and clean-living. Amid prevailing corruption and licentiousness they were, if loyal to their principles, honest and truthful. Their sexual standards were high: the marriage tie was respected and family life was pure. Such were aspects of being a Christian in the early days.    Another distinctive sign of early Christianity was its zealous evangelizing work. Christ commanded his followers: Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations. (Matthew 28:19, 20) Jean Bernardi, a professor at the Sorbonne University in Paris, France, noted: [Christians] were to go out and speak everywhere and to everyone. On the highways and in the cities, on the public squares and in the homes. Welcome or unwelcome. To the poor, and to the rich encumbered by their possessions. . . . They had to take to the road, board ships, and go to the ends of the earth.  True Christianity Today    True Christians today should stand out for their distinctive way of life, just as they did in the first century. Accordingly, Jehovahs Witnesses strive to adhere strictly to the precepts established by the first Christians. Their efforts to pattern their lives after the teachings of the Bible are noticed by others.    For instance, the New Catholic Encyclopedia acknowledges that Jehovahs Witnesses are known as one of the best-behaved groups in the world. The Deseret News of Salt Lake City, Utah, observed that Jehovahs Witnesses promote strong family ties and develop productive and honest citizens. The newspaper added: Members believe in a strong moral code. They believe smoking, overdrinking, drug misuse, gambling, sexual promiscuity and homosexuality are spiritually damaging practices. They teach honesty and good work habits.    The Witnesses also take to heart their responsibility to be zealous evangelizers. Commenting on this the New Catholic Encyclopedia says: The fundamental obligation of each member . . . is to give witness to Jehovah by announcing His approaching Kingdom. . . . To be a true Witness one must preach effectively in one way or another.    Clearly, true Christianity is much more than membership in one of the many religions of Christendom. Jesus himself foretold the rise of counterfeit Christians. (Matthew 7:22, 23) Jehovahs Witnesses invite you to learn what Jesus taught and put it into practice. That is what it means to be a Christian. Jesus said: If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.John 13:17.|`|AA11075358	Ok well    1) Christianity was 'created' if you like by Christ (Jesus) hence the name 'christ' ians. This was around the year 30ad . Before this christians were know as Jews who , like Jews today, believed that the messiah was still to come. There are about 18 500 sources that suggest that Jesus was a historical figure, that he did the things that the bible says, died and rose again. Comparing this with alexander the great who we have around 3 sources,     2) The bible was created by over 1000.s of years, No one knows exactly because the dating system that modern archeology uses may be wrong. Most christian scholars (people who study history as shown in the bible and compare this history with other ancient sources) think that Genesis was written around 15000 bc, Comparing this with the last books of the bible they think it was around 90ad.      3) How did Jesus come into the picture?  Like any other human! He was famous because he was and still continues to be God having supernaturtal abilities, Who in history do you know that rose again after being dead? But he is also famous for the things that he was. People are drawn to his character    What caused his downfall?  I bit hard to do without some of the biblical stuff but ill try! It was fortold that it would happen. The bible , a historcal document, has about 65ish prophecies that say that he would suffer and die, Secondly people caused his downfall, if you read the gospel accounts they tell of a number of people who wanted him killed, beacuse of the things that he was saying. But thirdly , sin caused his downfall, Christians believe that Jesus died for our imperfections so that we have have life with him.     Keep searching

But what they are missing is that there is proof. Being a Christian, I could show them a Bible and they will reject it as proof. So without knowing for sure that there is no God, atheists take it on faith that there is no God.    The other problem is that atheists change the definition of what religion is in order to not be accused of having one. But going on the current definition, atheism and evolution are both religions.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	Atheism is not a religion it's the absence of religion.
ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Not exactly, but when I stop praying it DOES affect my life in a negative way. I'm grumpier and more selfish on the whole. Then I realize, "Oh yeah, I should probably pray."|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Similar. I have suffered from both. But there is life built up in prayer to the one true God.

Thus you becomes selfish, I find i get slack sometimes. The more i pray, the more my life is in Sinc, the fresher and fitter i am to do what Jesus wants me to do.  Praying is not a drug, but it is essential to a relationship with Jesus, and should be to a christian as crucial as the air we breath.

I would try being more honest, as she's going hand her your number and say something like "Its been fun working with you these last few weeks give me a call if you ever want to go for coffee or something" You know for sure then that if she does call then you can meet up and see if she is interested in you. If she doesn't call then she is possibly not interested.    =)|`|Hs10ZIrnaa	You should talk to her about it in a way that hints your feelings, but keeps you from being overly exposed. The only reason I say that is that certain issues at work can become barriers and you should try to avoid people at work you dont trust from getting that info. Maybe ask her to meet you somewhere before she leaves. Just be careful, and look out for your best interests, and I think youll feel better letting her know in such a way too!|`|7LdjNoX7aa	don't leave a note. that's just bllaahhh      talk to her in person, something like wanna kick around or something. ask for her phone number and then work things out from there.|`|uD1UFdRsaa	You could..but think about it this way, is she really coming back at all?

aO4iCwtoaa	I'd repost this question in the baby names section (yes there is one ;) - those people are hardcore helpful on that sort of thing.    I don't think it's a common name in any religion - while there are many Jews named Yehuda (Judah in Hebrew), "Judah" in English is more of a fringe name and you rarely hear of it...  Judah Friedlander on 30 Rock is probably the only one I can think of.      The word "Jew" comes from "Judah," and it certainly is more 'Judaic' in nature than most Biblical names, but pretty much all Biblical names are also used by Christians.  Personally, I don't think it would be odd at all.|`|hcORMcOwaa	I love the name Judah as well. I don't know any Judah's personally but it's a great name!

I surely wouldn't worry about anyone kidding him about his name because of its biblical origin.

I agree with the stuff in the movie about religions taking a good idea and putting too many restrictions on it.

WpqfQOTJaa	Well, only muslims seem to believe that they can maim and kill. But in reality, that is a sin.    I guess the muslims never heard of the 10 commandments.|`|VncSMLMpaa	The LORD God (Allah?) has given the commandment that we must not kill. So there is no excuse for purposely going and killing anyone. To say, "God, willing" before doing something dreadful does not mean that you are no longer responsible. It means that you are actually answerable to God for disobeying His commands.    The quotations below are written by Moses which the LORD God commanded in Exodus and Deuteronomy, by the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew and by the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Roman church of Jesus' believers.    Exodus 20  13 Thou shalt not kill.      Deuteronomy 5  17 Thou shalt not kill.      Matthew 5  21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:   22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.      Romans 13  9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.      This is what both Judaism and Christianity teach so I don't understand why Islam would be any different.    I hope this helps.|`|AA11849917	And THAT (among many other things) is part of the problem with islam.  You spelled it out exactly.    You can justify ANY thing if you say "The will of Allah" - even when it is obviously NOT God's will at all, meaning that either God and Allah are not the same, or they are not true followers of Allah, and they should be punished to the full extent of the law!    Muslems agree that Moses was a prophet from God, and Moses gave us the 10 Commandments.  But it wasn't from Moses, but from God.    In the 10 Commandments, it is written, "Thou shalt not commit murder!"    So, these people are either false muslems, not part of Islam, and can not hide under the "It is Allah's will" banner, OR they ARE true muslems, and Islam is totally antagonistic to what God already revealed to us humans!    In EITHER case, it is up to all God-fearing people everywhere, of EVERY religion that believes in God in one form or another, to put a stop to these terrorists!|`|FBwK9s7Baa	there is no law except the law of naturae and when a man feels that to kill people is ok under law he is doing nothing but entertaining the law of nature which says he loves himself so much that he starts hating others. The law of nature has some rules which we do not understand and thus we go to extremes but if we understand that these laws are applicable to everybody we will understand that love not only means loving yourself or your community but loving everyone on on earth. God  was thinking of creating a perfect animal , he tried billion ways and found found something near to his expection and that is how a man was created who can think, can smile, laugh, love , live in societies and can care for humans as well as other creatures so he finally stopped giving the responsibility of all his previous experiments to this last creation as a gift but we did fail to understand this very own purpose of his creation and think only about ourselves|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	I take it you have never actually read the bible; it says honor the laws of land.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	The bible says that you can only serve on master, meaning that you either serve God or the devil, there is no in between...  And the God that I am talking about is not Allah, His name is Jehovah, and He is the God of the bible...|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	Being a Muslim, you do not believe in Jesus as the Son of God. Since I am not Muslim I can only answer you from a Christians point of view.  Jesus once said Render unto Cesar that which is Cesars and unto God that which is Gods. In short he was saying Obey the secular Laws and Gods laws. Allah, or God created all things. He did not create people to go out and kill other people. One of the Commandments is Thou shall not Kill. However, one can kill another to protect his family, himself or his country. That means in a military unit. Suicide is not a part of permissible  killing. Suicide bombers in my mind are sick, be they Muslims, Christians, or Jews. Allah, God is love. Think about it. If you have children, you love and protect them, you would be devastated if your child committed suicide, so would God, Allah. The Creator not the Destroyer. I do not hate Muslims, I believe that the large Majority of Muslims want to live a normal life, raise their families, praise God/Allah and live in peace. If you give to the poor, it is the will of Allah/God. I believe it is written in the Holy Koran. If you get hit by a car it is predestination. You were meant to be hurt or killed at that time.|`|7vD4dBK4aa	well thats where religion is bad but it ws a good basic for morals|`|0yUnnmdJaa	you can obey your religion but not go too far with it, you shouldnt go past reality... like comitting suicide because your religion. be realistic.|`|8wHg5MECaa	We should obey all.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Not to propagate discrimination, but...    killing an infidel ? PEACEFUL RELIGION???  DONT SOUND LIKE IT TO ME.    PLEASE READ AND FORWARD  This is a true story and the author, Rick Mathes, is a well-known leader in prison ministry. The man who  walks with God always gets to his destination.    If you have a pulse you have a purpose.    The Muslim religion is the fastest growing religion per capita in the United States, especially in  the minority races!!!    Last month I attended my annual training  session that's required for maintaining my state prison security  clearance. During the training session there was a presentation by  three speakers representing the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim  faiths, who explained each of their beliefs.    I was particularly  interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a  video.    After the presentations, time was provided for questions and answers.    When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked: 'Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that most Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world and, that by killing an infidel (which is a command to all Muslims) they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?'    There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he replied, 'Non-believers!'    I  responded, 'So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can have a place in heaven. Is that correct?'    The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the  cookie jar.'    He sheepishly replied, 'Yes.'    I then stated,  'Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr. Stanley ordering all Protestants to do the same in order to guarantee them a place in heaven!'    The Imam was speechless!    I  continued, 'I also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me! Let me ask  you a question: Would you rather have your Allah, who tells you to kill me in order for you to go to heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to heaven and He wants you to be there with me?'    You could have heard a pin drop as the  Imam hung his head in shame. Needless to say, the organizers and/or promoters of the Diversification' training seminar were not happy with Rick's way of dealing with the Islamic Imam , and exposing the truth about the Muslims' beliefs..    In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President!

We are to follow the laws of the land unless they go against God's Laws, ect..  Laws of the land meaning traffic laws, paying taxes, don't murder.  The Bible also teaches that it is against the law to kill.  God is a loving God.  He would never ask anyone to kill another person. The Bible also tells us to love our enemies and do good to those who persecute you.|`|vv1cdDFZaa	" I guess the muslims never heard of the 10 commandments "     Well evidently Moses also chose to disrigard them when he saw fit, as the nice little slaughter that ensude after he came down from Sinai shows.

My family cant tell the difference between christianity and culture explaining to my protestant mother about  emperor constantine was awful. She wants to believe so badly that she will believe rubbish, catholics are the same. muslims get angry because they cannot say no, to there parents twaddle about what is islam and what is there oppresive culture.   The good thing about religeon is the way it teaches us right from wrong. and we all know this.   If some idiot wants to make you do wrong through brainwashing about politics or religeon. Go to that little voice inside your mind and follow that, its called a conscience. we all have 1. and you should not go far wrong,  Its time to not follow ,but lead.   would you buy a car from some 1 who knew nothing of it or had never driven another car to compare, or would you read up and choose the best for you?  cast systems are haram,  arranged marriage is haram   the list is endless.  islam is a great religeon but the culture sucks. well half of it. one half nurtures the other oppresses,  the younger generation you cannot live your life through your parents wants. parents talk a lot of sense but you should marry who You want and not them, This makes me so annoyed, just say no and break the cycle. they can scream and shout ignore you, let them sulk. they will get over it, and if you havent got the strengh then dont do the same to your kids,  western kids went through this yrs ago, they are liberated.  follow your faith, and your instincts.|`|QNG4rslkaa	Some philosophers believe that God  are a ideia created to be able to follow a line on which the authorities determine how to not kill steal etc. .. read  friedrich nietzsche ( beyond good and evil)|`|ueNjDmPraa	There's a line between religion and man made made laws.  But Agnostic is a religion that follows man made laws whilst being open minded.    I'll explain and maybe you can find similarities within it to understand that some religions contradict themselves.    An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.  (Which given the circumstances is a fair view in my opinion).    An Agnostic does not accept any `authority' in the sense in which religious people do. He holds that a man should think out questions of conduct for himself. Of course, he will seek to profit by the wisdom of others, but he will have to select for himself the people he is to consider wise, and he will not regard even what they say as unquestionable. He will observe that what passes as `God's law' varies from time to time. The Bible says both that a woman must not marry her deceased husband's brother, and that, in certain circumstances, she must do so. If you have the misfortune to be a childless widow with an unmarried brother-in-law, it is logically impossible for you to avoid disobeying `God's law'.    That's just to try explain the background of the Agnostic Religion.    But to answer your question...    Does an agnostic do whatever he pleases?    In one sense, no; in another sense, everyone does whatever he pleases. Suppose, for example, you hate someone so much that you would like to murder him. Why do you not do so? You may reply: "Because religion tells me that murder is a sin." But as a statistical fact, agnostics are not more prone to murder than other people, in fact, rather less so. They have the same motives for abstaining from murder as other people have. Far and away the most powerful of these motives is the fear of punishment. In lawless conditions, such as a gold rush, all sorts of people will commit crimes, although in ordinary circumstances they would have been law-abiding. There is not only actual legal punishment; there is the discomfort of dreading discovery, and the loneliness of knowing that, to avoid being hated, you must wear a mask with even your closest intimates. And there is also what may be called "conscience": If you ever contemplated a murder, you would dread the horrible memory of your victim's last moments or lifeless corpse. All this, it is true, depends upon your living in a law-abiding community, but there are abundant secular reasons for creating and preserving such a community.    I said that there is another sense in which every man does as he pleases. No one but a fool indulges every impulse, but what holds a desire in check is always some other desire. A man's anti-social wishes may be restrained by a wish to please God, but they may also be restrained by a wish to please his friends, or to win the respect of his community, or to be able to contemplate himself without disgust. But if he has no such wishes, the mere abstract concepts of morality will not keep him straight.    Agnostic's decide right from wrong the same way anyone else does, but I believe they are more inclined to use the law as a Reference.    Hope you can make sense of that, and it may Assist you in an understanding.

Here is an edited version (just my interpretation):    He had a bad habit of peeping at girls having a shower in the river. He was a gangster in a criminal gang. He complied with all the requests from his leader, so he did a lot of bad things.

EPIELNBuaa	hmm, i like your thinking.  but i think everyone has their own standards of right and wrong, doesn't matter their religion. most everyone would agree murders wrong, doesn't matter if you believe theres a god or not, you still shouldn't take someone else's life, but also theres times when you have no choice, like if someones trying to kill you, obviously you're going to want to kill them first. a christian isn't going to ponder on going to hell if they kill this man in a situation like that, theres no time, you're just going to act with your own human instincts.   if theres a knife at your throat, but a gun in your hand, it doesn't matter if you're atheist, christian, muslim, or jewish, everyones probably going to have the same reaction, which is to defend yourself.  and its the same with goodness, an atheist isn't going to just be an a**hole for no reason just because he doesn't think theres a god. hes going to open the door for you, pull out your chair, pick something up for you when you drop it, or help you carry something that's too heavy, and a christians not just going to do those things because he wants to go to heaven and avoid hell. its just basic human nature.  i think everyones pretty even on the "potentially morally good" scale, its just a matter of what you actually do or do not do.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	yes i have answered questions in similar ways to what you say and the christian asker not only reported my answer but then emailed me to tell me he had and would block me and i was a c*nt|`|9m2LvlWdaa	It's not that I "have" no god.

History is useful, so is the golden rule.  Many morals are also ambiguous in Christian cultures, which religious people try not to acknowledge, but they have to update their religion to accommodate.     For instance it is NOT ethical or moral to marry 7 year or ten year old girls, yet US Christians did just that in the 1800s.    I would argue that reason and sense and compassion beats doctrine, but we have to be mindful of some cultural differences.

And for the most point, I personally, and other atheists that I know guide our morals by what we perceive is right and wrong. Which i believe for most of the people I know, usually includes the old mesopotamian way of thinking in that "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." And also the idea the respect begets respect. And I believe that Christians guide their morals not by what they think is right and wrong, but by why they think the church thinks is right and wrong, which makes me believe that the religious are pawns to the pope, and his will. And because instead of having morals that ones-self would think is right and wrong, and taking those provided to them by a single entidy that they take away personal identity and this is why we have fundamental differences in the ideas of what is right and wrong and political issue conflicts.|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Yes I do.  Just because you are an atheist dosn't mean you are a bad person lacking in good morals.  (Morals means to me; the way you conduct yourself and knowing the difference betweent right and wrong.)  God dosn't teach us this, mostly our parents do.  That dosn't mean (like 'finding God') that even non believers can change.  I also think it is cruel to tell a child that they will go to a bad place 'hell'.  In the correct society they should be given ALL the information and choose for themselves as they grow and not feel obliged or frightened to form their own opinion or beliefs.  In my perfect word...children would not have to choose to stick with a religion they do not belive in to make their parent's happy.|`|szeFBYDmaa	You need to dig a little deeper.    Atheists conclusions of right and wrong are experience driven. We don't like certain things so we don't inflict them on others. However what of things that we have not experienced? Many "save themselves" for "the one" but where does this mentality come from? This is a learned moral code originally from elders who have had their fair share of regrets.     Ironically I believe religion is pretty much the same thing. A bunch of elders congregated, formed a story riddled with "morality" to act as a guide for other members of the community who lacked the support group to teach the proper way to behave or else to control those who didn't care. See I believe the Christians who keep stating you are "immoral" without the Bible as if the Bible is the source of Morality have it the wrong way around. The Bible was written to the Moral code of the Iron age... This code is LONG outdated we (some of us) accept each others differences far more now. As long as you don't hurt me or anyone else, I don't CARE what you do to you.    I also believe Jesus DID die on the cross but again he was using knowledge he learned abroad to elevate his status and then use this status to leverage his ideas of peace (Ironically sending mankind into many a bloody war in his name). This is why the "miracles" of the new testament are comparatively wimpy when compared with their fully contrived bretheren of the old testament.    Muhammad was weaker again... Excellent general though, not that its unusual that a leader of love is adept at dispatching foes, after all love is one step away from hate right? sigh...    Anyway Ive prattled enough.      ===== Response ======    Sorry my Knickers are not bunched. I was simply drawing the similarity to your parents saying "do this or I will smack you" and a preacher saying "do this or you go to hell".    The mental trauma of the latter is definitely intensified but it was drawn up in very violent times.|`|83Cvwbu1aa	I try to "be good".I say this though.The very concept of Christianity,that of letting an innocent take the punishment for YOUR "crimes" is morally bankrupt.I'm not perfect as an atheist,but anyone who rejoices in an innocent's blood being shed in their stead cannot be moral.The belief itself voids any defensible position of morality.They love to speak of morals.Only because they have numbers.In fact,they are incapable of morality.They are indeed vile and reprehensible|`|0hOZyIp5aa	First I almost never argue about not having a god. Where is the Sense in arguing about something if you do not have a solid base to your argument. Like... does air smell better in LA to me or you? We can not see air so how are we sure it is the air we smell... then again where is the base for the argument. I would rather listen to music and read a good novel, see a new film, go to a race see Kansas in Topeka, write this too you. Argue when there are two ways to conclusion that benefits humanity like fossil fuels vs photocells nuclear power vs coal.  Whether one believes in a god or gods or not achieves no useful end until there are no one left to argue then it won't matter anymore|`|xpbu0fWHaa	Nice question. A point which I have been pondering over. It does look like if you do good with a view to doing genuine good and only good then that is doing goodness for its own sake and so makes one truly good. But when one does good out of fear of either the police or gods watching eye, then their actions are not motivated by a need to be good, but rather to avoid punishment. It would be wrong to suggest that religious people and non- religious people have different motivations when it comes to doing good. For fear of making this answer far too long, i refer you to Richard Dawkins' God Delusion chapter 5 the conclusion being that in fact motivations for doing good amongst believers is not at all based on the bible, but in fact more in line with that of the atheist. hard to believe at first glance but he actually makes for a very compelling argument. have a read, i think you might well enjoy it.

299243f56a214ab15cf9807c297e7e76aa	A universe existed before ours. After trillions of years it could no longer support life.   A race of beings survived until the end of their day's. These beings existed for hundreds of billions of years. They were so far evolved no such word exists to describe who and what they were.    They knew, all of what they are will be lost. They will have never been when their universe dies. They found a way to preserve whom they are.  They knew they had to create a place where all their knowledge can be. A dimension not effected by space-time, nor any laws of nature. A universe in itself where space and time do not exist and yet there it is.    These beings and all their knowledge indeed did survive.  Everyone of those beings shed their physical bodies and became beings of pure energy.  Still existing in their realm, all that they were, joined and became one of many. They became that which has no boundaries or form, but yet is.  They became pure thought.      Upon that joining a consciousness was born. So unique, that it never was before,  in a place that never was before.   God became, the Nether-World is.    God thought " I think. I am. But, I also am many." God is all those beings in him.  He said, " I am that which has created me. Those that I know, in me, I am." "For it is them that created me, therefore, I am I, I also am those whom have formed me as to not perish."     He understood what he had to do.    Gods purpose was clear.   Life was given unto him by those which he is.  He is,  because they are alive in him to hold safe.   God thought, "I am because those that I am in me, are to be that which they were,  before I became."    " I must create a place for them. A place like theirs before, so to be reborn in flesh and not perish."  he goes on, " I must create that which was!  For in as much as life that I am, All those in me I do know, shall also have life.     When all those have been given life again, only God will remain. Therefore, He also must be born for the purpose which is no longer.   God must now become that which has created him. He will be born. He will become human. He will also die.    To know this truth and all that entails with it, sheds light unto all things. Everything in this world falls into place.   Those in him, with him, "Let's make man in our image".

(I am not sure, but I THINK the writer is Harold S Kushner). the word "us" and "our" there in the Bible refer to GOD AND ANIMALS. God said to the animals: let US make man in our image, after our likeness. it means that man has GOD-like features, and animal-like features. we can love, care, forgive, distinguish right or wrong, etc which are GOD features. besides, we also have temptation, sex desire, lust of power, etc which are animal features. so, the man ISN'T just GOD image, but mixture of GOD and animal. the book addresses few things further. for example, because we are some kind of mixture between GOD and animal, live has been very complicated to us. because sometimes, our GOD-like and animal-like features don't go along together very well. for example, we have desire of sex. but, our GOD-like feature tells us that doing sex with anybody is wrong. we should doing sex with the one which we truly love. we can distinguish what is wright and wrong. therefore, these two features "fight" each other. if we were animals, it would be very easy. we just can do sex with everyone, including our parents and children.|`|d4bb87a1bf726fdec807a65a476fa036aa	If it were talking about Jesus and the Holy Spirit, then why don't Jews or Muslims believe in them?  All three use the Old Testament.     The Trinity is a Christian invention. If you think about it, it's actually PANTHEIST (multiple gods), although they will never admit it. Many biblical stories are actually "borrowed" from Babylonian and Egyptian religions.  Much of Christianity is a mix of these stories, and Roman Pagan traditions.    **The More You Know...|`|ySBm6GkLaa	our likeness, is that  us all after all we all look the same.

Astrology is a work of satan|`|e3gZsCsgaa	That's what I want to know and I'm waiting for evidence.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Its's a false science they are based on the constellations. Though we are all made of star stuff our lives our not dependent on their positions in the sky.  On top of that, most astrologers base their predictions on maps that are thousands of years old and the stars are not in the same places anymore, even the sky changes.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	False, IMHO.  There is no reason to believe that the position of the stars at your birth determines your personality or your fate.  If it did, then identical twins have the same personality, and they don't.  My horoscope says I should have leadership ability, and that couldn't be more wrong.|`|3rrcStxAaa	It's absolutely 100% true in every way.|`|VvZPM6Yyaa	it is truely true     : )|`|AA11676104	Friend,    it is absolutely true ,if the Astrologer is a perfect master, who knows  the all combinations and permutations correctly.    If he ,the astrologer is half knowledgeable, then his predictions are incorrect.|`|8wHg5MECaa	It may be true.|`|JMOLRKRraa	Astrology is mapped energy vibrations. Believing at first breathe the energy influences your being. I think it can be used as a map for understanding. God said he would use the heavens and stars for signs, etc. However, when you become born again, you are above the physical energies and can more easily overcome, and be above all physical astrological influences. Makes interested reading. Used mainly for self understanding. more inportantly, is your God true?|`|FZ0hwowaaa	The answer is true. It's a science of awareness. It has worked on my chart 100%.|`|bliNBGxeaa	all false man. dont buy into it ahahaha they just want to toss you round like a lil rag doll. dont buy into it|`|Hr2tnZtqaa	Well I am one who believes that all things are connected. Though I an not one who believes my future is written in the stars. I believe they do have an influence on us. I don't believe in the horoscopes in the newspapers they are too general. I think though a good understanding of  astrology would be helpful to us all.|`|0bQKmqZ6aa	Astrology is totally untrue whether one limits oneself to simply the zodiac signs as a general pointer or whether one goes into the details of horoscopes, even less so matching of horoscopes for wedding purposes.|`|R4F05z4Faa	Personally, I don't believe in astrology as such. It only works because of the calendar we use, and because of the location of Earth in the Galaxy.    However, I do find that a lot of it seems to be true, or at least amazingly coincidental. My own personality seems amazingly accurately described by my own star sign. But there is no scientific evidence behind it at all; a lot of astrological facts can be applied to lots of people who are not of that particular star sign. Like, Cancerians are supposed to be emotional, whereas Aquarians are more reserved; I know many unfeeling Cancerians and overly emotional Aquarians. So the truths seem to be just coincidence.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Astrology is true, but u don't have good astrologist, many r fake, and want to rob your money, without understanding the stars themselves. Astrology is too much commercialised, u see them on tv, magazines etc. etc. It has unnecessarily got too much glamor.   True astrology scholars who understand the star r sadly missing.|`|FuyXRHHzaa	If it is number astrology then it is true but if it is not number astrology then it's false.|`|g9t2LQhtaa	Affirmations are statements of belief..If you keep thinking of the same thing all the time there might be a possibility of that thing happening..

It has nothing to do with "psychic powers" and does not imply any kind of "fate" on its own.    For those who have not explored the subject, horoscopes are not all there is to astrology. Horoscopes only deal with a tiny part, the Sun, because that fits best in a small space and is easiest to look up. Astrology does NOT try to fit everyone into 12 boxes, and far from being purposely vague, most of you would be surprised by its complexity. A full astrological chart is based on the date, place and exact time of birth and you have a minimum of 7 planets, 12 signs and 12 houses, and the geometric relationships between them, as well as transits and progressions. Actual astrology is so complex that no one else will have the exact same chart as you do for millions of years. Contrary to popular belief, it has never been "debunked" by science because the ones trying to debunk it stop at the newspaper columns and never explore the subject in its entirety. In fact, most of the arguments against it (the difference between the two zodiacs that we *do* know about thank you very much, the 13th sign BS, etc.) show a total lack of understanding of what astrology actually does and what it's used for. And we also count among our number several doctorates and other highly-educated people who learned it so they could disprove it and found they were unable to.    Astrologers will differ on the hows and whys of astrology. I can only speak for myself. The stars do not make anything happen to you, they're only reflecting what is already happening via synchronicity. A good analogy is that a clock striking noon doesn't make you eat lunch, but it does make it a lot more likely than lunch will be had. I do not believe that astrology can predict specific events, only archetypal themes that will be in play. A particular aspect can play out in an infinite number of ways, but it can not "just mean anything," it will stick to the archetypal themes of the planets, signs, houses and aspects involved. Many psychological concepts, such as the midlife crisis, have an astrological correlate.|`|hnxifSRZaa	depends on person to person|`|8sMr9Vmtaa	People try to find the answer to their questions about love, work, travel and other aspects and they usually use the horoscopes to know what to expect. Horoscopes can be obtained from private astrologers, magazines, on the internet or you can even request them via email.    For those who believe in it and for those who do not, it will always be a complex subject to discuss, but there is nothing wrong with taking a sneak peek into our possible future.|`|xvJ8AKgUaa	It depends on how you look at it. I don't find it false. There are so many predictions that have come out true and astrologers are no God's who will say 100 % right things. But some really predict to the mark.|`|NvkkJ8V6aa	true

Good Luck to you.|`|NLinPsyhaa	If this is truly your heart, then God bless you. God may not solve your problem right away. His promise is only to give you the strength to endure. There is a lot of rhetoric in the Bible about this like steel being strengthened by fire and having the endurance to finish the race.    God also promises to fulfill our needs. So look fir His answer and know that He is with you and cares greatly for you and is concerned for you and will lead you through.    I can e-mail you my testimony if you like, it is quite long. If not I can tell you that He has brought me and my family through some very trying times and still is.

The only way I could go was to accept a demotion which cost me $125 a week.  After about 2 months of this, this bills started mounting.  I prayed to God for help.  I wasn't specific about how this help would come, I just trusted God to provide the help the way he saw fit.  The next day, I got a call telling me that a lady in our company was going to take an early retirement, and I got my old position back in my new city and my pay was restored.    I wish you the best and pray that things work out for you.|`|z74a7wvlaa	It's tough indeed. As catholic, I was raised to go to church every Sunday, the legacy of my parents. That's where I learned, [besides my parents], my morals and righteousness. I was never attracted to empty/ false advertising, but I aimed high.  I worked myself to get better education and got in there. I was one of the first CPA in our community at that time. Now I am retired, with not really great pension, comfortable and I still save by living frugally.   I encountered hard times, when I was laid off in '80. My husband and I got rattled by the early downsizing with mortgage and raising a family.  We both took courses to strenghten our weaknesses; I even took hobby television course to improve my speaking interview skills. In other words, I did all I knew how to best equip myself for this changing world. Who told us? Nobody, but the direction we took is from the guiding God.  You hear words, " pray hard, faith, salvation, patience, love the neighbors, etc"; those are God's buzz words and pay attention and use them as we encounter rough rides in our life journeys. Have faith is equal to be positive always.  Until now, my commitment to God remains since day one.. Sunday Mass is obligatory, as the day when you met Him and  say "Thank you, Lord'.|`|JCnSm91uaa	Are you kidding... you don't seem to read the Bible!    There is no Bible God, except for what the Jewish Bible writers put together to bust the morale and to control the uneducated bunch of Hebrew shepherds living in the Palestine region! This Bible God turned out to be very whimsical and unpredictable. Later on, some Greek Jews came up with the New Testament to make it applicable to Christians living elsewhere from Israel  So here you have a few snapshots on this primitive Bible God!    Job 9:23 (NIV) When a scourge brings sudden death, God* (*NOT SATAN, but God!) mocks the despair of the INNOCENT.     Job 9:17 (NIV) He* (*God NOT SATAN, but God!) would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds FOR NO REASON.     Job 9:24 (NIV) When a land falls into the hands of the wicked* (*like the USA falling into the hands of Obama?), he* (*God) blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it*? (*Certainly not SATAN!)    Lamentations 3:37-38 (infallible King James Version) Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH PROCEEDETH NOT EVIL AND GOOD*? (*Preachers lie, they say that God is GOOD, but not firstly EVIL read it again FIRST EVIL and then good as a teaser!)      Exodus 4:11 (NIV) The Lord said to him, Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord? (Isnt the Bible God so nice to brag about it so we dont have to blame the Devil for handicapping people all the time?)    Amos 3:6 (infallible King James Version) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be EVIL in a city, and the lord hath not done it?* (*ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM GOD NOT FROM SATAN!!!)    Proverbs 16:4 (NIV)  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF EVIL.    DONT BLAME THE DEVIL, PLEASE!!! No primitive religion in the world is as wicked as the Bible God religion and I dont even want to talk about Islam! Christians made up in their mind about what Christianity ought to be all about in spite of the overwhelming primitive savagery describing the Bible God! How masochistically oriented you must be to become a Christian?    Ruth 1:20-21 (NIV) Don't call me Naomi, she told them. Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty* (*NOT SATAN, but God Almighty! PRAISE THE LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) has brought misfortune upon me.    Proverbs 1:26-28 (NIV) I* (*God NOT SATAN, but God!)  in turn will laugh at your disaster; I WILL MOCK WHEN CALAMITY OVERTAKES YOU* (*Christians are taking advantage of any calamity like a forthcoming California Earthquake to convey a message from the Bible God) - when calamity overtakes you like a storm* (*please read carefully it doesnt say when I send calamity! but when it happens the SOB Bible God takes advantage of it! God is also at the mercy of the weather conditions! You need to have a very low IQ to qualify as a minister of the Word of God!), when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they* (*Gods people) will look for me but will not find me* (* yeah, what do I have to do with all that?).    There goes the Im with you to the end or is it only a joke? This God is real only in the clever mind of the Bible writers     Jeremiah 11: 14 "Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them, BECAUSE I* (*God) WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR DISTRESS.    Nothing scares primitive religious people more than the idea that their God doesnt listen to them! It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right that God will answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!    Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or badin order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who callsshe was told, The older will serve the younger. Just as it is written: Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so because he is telling you!)  For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is no respecter of persons when he is on record to be very picky just for the heck of it!)      Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesnt like you for ever just for the heck of it!)    Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.    Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Jobs children slaughtered!

Focus on the eternal.    God hears every prayer, but the first one He answers is, "Help me, I'm a sinner."  Believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved from hell, but this is only the first step.  You cannot know God without believing that Jesus is His Son.  You can know ABOUT God, but can't really KNOW Him.  If you admit to God that you have not lived a perfect life and need Christ's pure righteousness to cover your sin, you will be saved.    Once you're saved, you can pray for anything that is in God's will and it will be done for you (John 15.7).  It may be that He is using this tough time in your life to bring you to a realization that you need something more than yourself.  The fact that you're seeking Him now means you've come to that point (the same point I arrived at more than 8 years ago; He used the same method to bring me to Himself).      I urge you to take the next step and accept Christ as your savior.  Get alone or with a Christian minister and say something like, "God, forgive me for my sins.  I believe that Your Son Jesus died and rose again so that I could be reconciled to You. I need You now and forever.  Fill me with Your Holy Spirit.  I surrender my life to You, and I accept Your will in my life."

If what you want is the sort of  greeting that people use when they take leave of one another after a conversation or at the end of a message, then Daniel would have been right if he had not made spelling mistakes.    " bient?t !(soon)  " tout  l'heure" !(very soon, as in the same day)     If what you want to do is give an instruction to someone urging them to say what is on their mind fairly quickly, then it is either "Parle bient?t" to someone you are close to, or "Parlez bient?t" to someone you are less familiar with (or a group of persons). You would not use it as a parting greeting at the end of a phone call or a letter.

qnD5RfbPaa	I agree with you.  Christians today should learn more about fasting.  There are several mention about fasting in the bible.  Most of which dates back long before Jesus Christ walked on this earth - Judges 20:26; 2 Samuel 12:21.  On none of these occasions were fasting done on happy occasion or as religious ritual.  They were all done on genuinely sad occasions.  If you go back in history, you'll note that fasting was practiced during depressing, mournful stages of persons life.  The same was true in the case of Jesus when he fasted - he was certainly not a happy man.  He was very depressed.  That is born out at Matthew 26:38, 39.  Another question worth considering, how many times of Jesus' 30 years on earth is it mentioned that he fasted?  If this was a religious ritual, would it not be done as "customary" on a regular basis as in the case of the passover, which is up to this day being practiced as "communion" or "memorial" in some churches?|`|EAuMJrs4aa	you might hallucinate and think some thing that wasnt there was talking to you even tempting you, maybe|`|hiCSVwchaa	A complete fast for forty days would be incredibly unhealthy and would kill a good percentage of people who attempted it.

AA12059450	Well, today's pop-theology has redefined "pastor" into something not in line with the New Testament use of the word.    Three Greek "word families" are used of a single group of church leaders:    "Pastor" or "shepherd"  "Bishop" or "overseer"  "Elder" or "presbyter"    We find the three applied to the same group in Acts 20:13-38. While these leaders are called to teach the Word, they should not be confused with ministers or "preachers." The New Testament speaks of people who fill various roles in the church:    Ephesians 4:11-12 "He is the One who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to teach the Good News, and some to be teaching pastors. He did this to equip the saints for good work, so that the body of Christ can be built up."    As far as Biblical "pastors" are concerned, no, women cannot fill that job. As for the others...      Romans 16:1 "I commend to you our SISTER Phoebe, a MINISTER of the church in Cenchrea."    ... 7 "Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and fellow prisoners. They are LEADERS AMONG THE APOSTLES and became believers in Christ before I did."   ("Apostles" is used here in a general sense, meaning an emissary or "one SENT." It is used in this way several times in the New Testament. An alternative reading would be that they are held in high esteem BY THE TWELVE, but the text better supports a reading as I rendered it here. The text says "... IN the apostles" and "... OF the apostles" would indicate the alternative reading should be preferred.)      Acts 2:17 " 'In the last days,' God says, 'I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. Your sons AND DAUGHTERS will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.' " (Peter quoting Joel 2 on Pentecost)|`|Gsd4VD13aa	No. The bible says that women should stay silent in church and, if they have questions, ask questions later to their husbands.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	No , 1 corinthians 14:34-35 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.     35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	There were women priests in the early years, but men had the power to ban them. There is no verse to prove that because men have controlled the wording of the Bible.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	Paul was talking about cultural issues and not spiritual issues.......When Jesus rose from the grave, the first person He told to tell of the Risen Lord was Mary Magdalene, the first person to preach the gospel.|`|2WnbP80Taa	The old Levitical laws were given for the sacrifices of the animals--taking of life.  Woman's original role was life giving.  God did not want confusion between the two.    With Jesus death on the cross, the ultimate and last sacrifice, the temple veil was rent in two (torn), thereby giving all access to God.  the communion that is now given to the congregation is symbolic of "life" giving--thereby giving all the role of becoming priests in order that the full and correct word of God be preached by all.  The Holy Spirit empowers all to/for the Glory of God to any who are willing to accept.  Jesus began the New order of Priesthood with changing of the laws in Hebrews 7:12 , then read 1 Peter 2 :1-10  --edit--you have been given the full verses it is up to you to read with understanding.  God gives wisdom to those who seek the truth (James 1:5)    edit----- Acts 5;29  But Peter and the apostles replied, "we must obey God, rather than people."    So who are you or any other man on God's creation to tell a person not to obey God, rather obey man--i think I will take my chance with God on Judgment day, than what man dictates on earth.  2 sentences from the Bible does not constitute the whole truth, and this is what is called cherry picking when you exclude the verses that you choose not to obey.|`|TMb076n6aa	Romans 16 Paul exhorted the churches to recieve these women and the women women where honored in these churches as servents of God along side the men. also in this chapter you will find the list of women that where honored here.

Galations 3:28 speaks of there is NIETHER male OR  female meaning He OR SHE God annoints He appoints.  Some men use the bible verses 1Cor 14:34-35 to justify thier sexism and fleshly attitudes but it is NOT the REAL gospel.     It is legalism.

If you remember it was Mary who first encountered Jesus after his ressurection, and was commanded to tell the brothers that he lives. They didn't believe her.. why did he go to mary first... ?

Yes we can blame woman for eating the apple; but excuse me it was Man who was told not to eat from the tree first. so there is no one right they both sined.   it says that woman are the WEAKER sex that means we men are Weak.. whats my point there is no male and female in Gods eye site.. without christ it doesn't matter. both sexes will end up in either Hell or Heaven.

But ill try and keep it brief    Firstly the dreaded passage    1 Timothy 2:12   'I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent' (NIV)     I think that with everything in the bible we have to take context into consideration. That is what the culture was, who was the writer, what . who was the community they were writing about. We dont take things literally    The author Paul (as mentioned in 1:1) in 1 timothy is writing to a particular group of people. In chapter 1 he is personally warning the community about false teachers.  In chapter 2 he continues this personal wriitng he says in 2:1 I 'I urge you' Again Paul is writing to a particular situation. We cant just take their instructions and apply it literally. We have to be VERY careful about what we apply literally and what we don't. Paul wriiting to a particular situation indicates that this is a unique situation to them.      Notice how he uses the word 'I' a lot. I urge, I want I. This says also that Paul is issuing specific instructions to that community, That it may not be a instruction for everybody just a select few. If your parents tell you I dont want you to do this. Then thats obviulsy not a instruction for every child in the world, Just you at that particular time and place. The same issue here!     He also says in the same pasage that 'I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing' I dont see many men literally lifting their hands in prayer. If we dont take that literally then why do we take the women one seriously.     If you look at the bible verses that talk about headship and women Col and ephesians etc they are not talking about the church leadership. They are talking about family.      Secondly consider the importance that Jesus places on women. He used them as disciples, witnesses and subjects of some of his miracles. In a culture where women werent allowed to be witnesses in a trial. He used them extensivly in his ministry. They were the last ones to leave him when he died and the first ones to see him when he rose again    Finally consider Galation 3:28   There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.' Jesus has given us equality with him      Marie Wiebe once saidIm an ordained minister in the Evangelical Covenant Church...At first Thought God was calling me into the ministry in spite of the fact that I am a woman. Now I know its because I am a woman. (Sojouner, 1987, 24) Women have a unique gifts talents etc to bring to ministry. I have meet so many people who have been hurt a aa male pastor who was insensitive , uncaring,unsympathetic etc. Plesae dont think that I ams saying that all men are like that! Women have a totally different view on ministry. My life has been so changed and impacted by the gospel because of key women ministers, I hope that despite the challenges that I can have the same impact on people for the sake of the gospel in my ministry. They are several women who have impacted the church and christians in extradortinary ways. I hope to be one of them. I would hate for the church to miss out on the things that women have to offer in leadership.     Again there is many more evidence, a whole sermon series actually. But can we not forget about why we are all here. I cant help wonder what a world that encourages women to  do anything thinks of a faith like ours?|`|QyoZq1z2aa	And out come the Bible Worshippers, you do know the Bible can be an idol.  Your answer is in the verse you quote.  This is from a letter concerning problems with women in the Corinthian Church.  It's about coming down on these women to regain order.    I follow only the laws of God and the teachings of Jesus.  Show me where either outlawed female pastors.  500 years ago someone decided that whatever John or Paul, or others quoted in bible was also law.  This began the era of replacing the church with the bible.

Most  people value their own opinions as their moral standard.      If what you do goes against what you SAY you believe then your true morality is not what you SAY but what you do.    In otherwords, it is impossible to say you have a moral standard which you violate.  Your very actions reflect your true morality.    To answer your question-- whenever I have done something wrong it has taught me that this is my true moral standard and not just what I say I believe in and would want to follow ideologically.    Romans 12:2-3, "And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.  For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."|`|bedc698be1c90ce671e453e85acde4bdaa	Yes.  What, doesn't really matter so I'll save time and skip to the next part of the question.    What I learned from the experience is that my moral values were too rigid.  I had morals that were rigid and based on what I learned as a child.  But morals should develop.      So absolutely there is something worth more than standing firm on what you believe.  There's learning that your beliefs are wrong and changing your values (even if only slightly) to reflect this.  When your morals improve as a result, this is clearly an improvement.

Not only because she sees it everyday but because her clothes probably no longer fit properly. So, no you don't need to say something. It would be rude and inappropriate and she could make a case against you for harassment. Think about why she may have had this change... 1) Pregnant-if she is she is likely waiting until her second trimester to announce it and you will know soon enough. 2) Enhancement-you are not close enough work friends to warrant her divulging her personal business to you. 3) Weight-gain-if this is the case she's already self-conscious and doesn't need some nosy co-worker sticking it where it doesn't belong. Plus if you say something you'll make her feel bad.   I get the feeling you don't like her which is fine but there is nothing good that will come out of making her feel awkward, pressured to divulge personal information or bad about herself.

wrxs9Wblaa	I'm sorry you are getting so many silly answers, because what a great question!    The reason Americans speak 'American English' is that it's it's own dialect, created by all of the English speaking people who first arrived from Europe.  The British were obviously the driving force because they colonized America, and when others arrived, it was sink or swim...in other words, learn English or be left out of jobs, culture, etc.   Most of the people in America (in the beginning) with money and power spoke English, so the rest followed suit as a means of survival-for some history of the language itself, see link below.|`|VCyY0WOQaa	R U SERIOUS!|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	To play with you, english in a first place is a bastard language, a mixture of germanic and french language...

IGb7gXpZaa	In non-native English speaking countries they give more emphasis on Grammar. so people in these countries although they may perfectly understand and have knowledge of the English language, they might not be able to be as good as on speaking and activities like that. If a person doesn't speak with English language native speakers often he might not be able to jump into a conversation with an English speaking person anytime he wants.Lately many private schools in non English speaking countries have been employing English teachers to educate the pupils in the speaking part of English and also many schools have engaged in schooling programs such as Socrates Comenius etc.|`|BWt4mj13aa	Yes.

I don't know why, I think it was because of their dark skin, but they speak English better than most Americans.

Most of us are in the depth of our own egos .. look around you and notice there are millions who have LESS of what you have and know, they are in a worse frame of mind, they have more right to think of death - no?  Count your blessings plus make the best of what you have and made - learn to relax take a distance of the inner fear that is troubling you..take a step each day with a positive mind .. nothing wrong in believing in God, find your 'inner strength'!!!

You've already made it to step one, believing that God is there and cares for you.

Start by doing for others, and you will not be depressed.Joy will flood your soul.      And we cannot pray for god to take anyone.Jesus prayed the Father in John 17:15.that he does not take them from the world but to keep them from the evil in it. Read John 15,16,17. And quit wallowing in self pity. That is not cool.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	God is listening to your troubles, it will get better trust me.|`|AA10166652	God does not want you to end your life....but the devil sure does!! Don't let him have that chance!!!!    My friend, I was a long-term sufferer of depression, too (note the word "was"). Want to know how my life got turned around?    The Bible says, in Psalm 55:22, "Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall." (NIV) And in 1 Peter 5:7, the Bible says "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.". So.....I gave God the things that held me bound to my feelings; and instead of crying, and being in emotional agony, I laughed!! Even through my endless tears.....I laughed!! HA! HA! HA!     This made NO sense to me, at the time.....but I stood in faith, and just laughed; most of the time, all I did was speak out the words "ha, ha, ha".....but I kept speaking them, until the spoken words became a real sound out of my mouth.    I stayed hooked up with God, and continuously read the Bible.....especially the Scriptures that dealt with the joy, peace and happiness!! God did not give us a spirit of fear......but of power, love and a SOUND MIND!!! ?    Please allow me to share this excerpt with you.......    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Emotions can lead us astray, but God's Word stands firm and unchanging. We must maintain strong faith in God, and hold even tighter to Him when we undergo trials and temptations. The Bible tells us that God will never allow temptations into our lives that are too much for us to handle (1 Corinthians 10:13). Although being depressed is not a sin, one is still responsible for how he responds to his affliction, including getting the professional help he needs. Depression can sometimes be caused by a physical disorder that needs to be treated with medication and/or counseling. Of course, God is able to cure any disease or disorder. However, in some cases, seeing a doctor for depression is no different than seeing a doctor for an injury.    The Bible tells us to be filled with joy and praise (Philippians 4:4; Romans 15:11), so God apparently intends for us all to live joyful lives. This is not easy for someone suffering from situational depression, but it can be remedied through God's gifts of prayer, Bible study and application, support groups, home groups, fellowship among believers, confession, forgiveness, and counseling. We must make the conscious effort to not be absorbed in ourselves, but rather to turn our efforts outward.    Feelings of depression can often be solved when the sufferer takes the focus off himself and puts it on Christ and others.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      God loves you!!!

When I am down she allows me to have a little time then knows just wat to do to snap me back to my normal self.

Hadiths are in fact Gospels of various narrators, who heard them from Prophet Muhammad.    Every single word that was revealed is in Quran. And the information he received in a thought or idea form is in Hadith. Nothing is missing or omitted from Quran.

4854FMZjaa	The statue of Liberty in New York harbour is a gift to America from the people of France. It represents noble values such as liberty, freedom, justice. If an American patriot is proudly showing me this statue of Liberty, how would he feel if I insultingly spat on this statue?  The American patriot will surely feel greatly hurt. One can argue that the statue is, after all, a piece of stone and metal; something inanimate. Why have feelings about it?  Who put the feelings there?    I carry a hankerchief in my pocket. I can blow my nose into this piece of cloth (hankerchief). Suppose I wave  this hankerchief before an audience and ask the people to salute my hankerchief. Who will salute it? And yet, people of all nations proudly salute their nations' flags. They will lay down their lives for their nations' flags. The hankerchief and the flags are both, after all, made of inanimate cloth. But the flag is infused with the noble sentiments of the nation.     The black and white photograhs of my late father and mother hang on a wall of my house. A visitor spits on these photos and hurts my feelings. It is, after all, a piece of paper with black and white dots. Why have feelings for such inanimate piece of paper?     The people of India display such fine sensitivities to seemingly inanimate objects like mountains and rivers and infuse in them feelings and noble values. Such objects (such as the sacred Ganga river) are not confined to India. Judaism  reveres the sacred Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, Islam reveres the stone of Kaaba, and the sacred fount that exists near the Kaaba; its waters are held as sacred by Islam (Zam-Zam Waters), Christianity reveres the Cross and the statues such as Mary and the child. All these are, after all, made of inanimate materials. Why have any feelings for them?  Should one try to understand the ideals behind those idols?   In the absence of any ideal, one might otherwise look upon them as stone worshippers or idol worshippers.|`|4POpmCrlaa	I thought it was just for decorative purposes. I don't have that fish thing.

People beleive that to be a "Minister or Pastor", you must attend a School of Theology, to have extensive course in college to be able to "Rightly Divide the Word of God".  This is not true at all.  The Lord God Almighty....decides those that He wants to "Rightly divide" the Word, who Preaches and Teaches.  There is nothing in this Life or any person, that surpasses God's Perfect Will, for anyone.  Having said all this, the "Beleiver" is to follow the Word of God.  The Symbol on a car, is how the person that owns it, displays to others that they are a "Beliver in Jesus Christ" and that they are considered "Fishers of Men".  There is nothing more to that.    If you look farther in the Bible, concerning fish, there are others things stated also.  For instance, the Jewish were not allowed to eat any fish that did not have scales or fins.  In that particular context though, it was for safety reasons as far as a food.  But I know you see my point.    Everything you say or do, or how you act toward others, has some sort of impact on others, this then is the reason whay the Lord gave us rules for how we are to live everyday.  We need to always be of Honor to Our Lord and Savior!!  BUT.....we need to be careful that we do not make rules so strict......that we end up hampering our ability to Draw the "Un-Saved" to the Lord.  Our Focus must always be this....to have our Eyes and Hearts on the Lord Jesus Christ and nothing more.  He will apply the needs of others through us on His own, using us in whatever way He sees fit, we just need to be ready, willing, and able, right???|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	My symbol is Jesus and I follow him not a fish.|`|AA11622701	If you still follow that law, then I assume you also follow the 613 other ones given at the same time.  That includes not cutting your hair, locking yourself away whenever you are having "period", and not wearing more than one type of fabric at the same time.  It also fobids the making of a human likeness, which means you avatar on here would be equally a "sin".      As Christians, we are not, and never have been, required to follow the 614 Mosaic laws, of which that is one.  Those were laws given to the Jews under their covenant with God, not laws given to the Gentiles on the Christian covenant.  (Kind of like a contract between GM and their workers would not apply to Ford workers.)    Plus hopefully you realize that the laws is forbidden the making of images for the purpose of worship, not for the purpose of communication.  If the latter was true,  we would have to abandon all reading and writting, but every letter of the alphabet has its origin as an image of something.  This was especially true of the Paleo-Hebrew scripture in which this commandment would have been originally written.  Each letter was not only a sound, but could also be used as a symbol or image of a person, animal, or object.  So logically, this verse could never have been intended to be used that way.  Otherwise it would outlaw itself.  (Nice how you dropped the entire idol concept from the verse with you "...".  If you only quote parts of a statement, it is usually possible to twist any meaning you want out of it.    The emblem of the fish is nothing something that Christians worship or treat as a God, but is merely a symbol used to convey a concept about Christ.  As such, nothing in scripture (Old or New) prohibits it use.|`|PKULDaC7aa	For one if I came back and everyone was wearing a symbol of my murder weapon around their neck I probably wouldn't be happy.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	ok, I thought you were going to tell us you bought into the ziegiest  garbage|`|vNvtwuBfaa	Two Books:    The Dark Side of Christian History   by Helen Ellerbe    Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices   by Frank Viola and George Barna    Previously:  Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices by Frank Viola    These books go into detail about many many practices held by Christian churches that came to us from paganism.

Be not like the heathen and go out in the woods and cut a tree and bring it into the house and adorn it with gold. We love Christmas trees.  And Jesus gave us two more commandments to add to the original ten to keep, but we only recognize there being ten.

It's a case of belief influencing perception.  In your example, the Old Testament people (particularly Ninivites) worshiped the fish as a God.  On the other hand the Icthys is a symbol of the call of Christ for his followers to be fishers of men.  The Cross itself can be held in the wrong regard, but properly viewed it reminds christians of Salvation through christ.  The peace symbol is said to be an upside down broken cross, and therefore a mockery of Christianity.  I believe it's just a symbol of Peace.  The first thing to consider is what the symbol means to those who view it.|`|nFk8FXUwaa	My fellow Christians, did you know that you can remove your doubt by purchasing and reading the book "Christians! - How Not To Be Superstitious For Dummies!"|`|QyoZq1z2aa	Jaye, by your definition that would make a nativity scene evil.  You are not to worship any images.  As you can see by the reaction of question givers, when someone sees a person wearing a cross, or with a fish symbol on their car, they think of Jesus.

Dios el Padre, tienes mi vida, haces con migo lo que te guste...Mi vida esta en sus manos."    I agree with that answer to an extent.   If you're conjugating all the verbs in the "tu" form. the end needs to say "tus manos" and not "sus manos".      If you're going for complete grammatical perfection, you'll want to put a period after vida and make the next a lone sentence.  and make sure you put a tilde over "est".    If it's considered more a prayer, you might want to start it out how most Spanish-speakers do with "Dios que ests en los cielos," instead of "Dios el padre".  If you do decide to keep it that way, you'll want to capitalize "Padre".    "Haces conmigo lo que te guste" is correct but it means "you do with me what you want".  If youre going more for the command or request form you'll want to say "que me hagas lo que te guste" meaning more "do to me what you want"  ("con" as "with" has more of a companionship meaning as opposed to the English connotation of "do with me what you want" therefore it would sound more like God wanting to go get coffee with you or play tennis).

And just because you do something wrong doesn't mean you are blind to the same fault in others.  Even fat people are brutal about other fat people sometimes.|`|HFZHI8VGaa	I think everyone is racist to a default. I am black and we are the most racist of them all, but let some body say something about black people and they calling Al Sharpton or Jessie Jackson! I am racist towards certain races and am ashamed to say that i got it from my dad. he calls all spanish people mexican and so do I. It is not of ill intent, but I cannot tell where they come from. I cannot stand the ones that come here and expect me a tax payer to teach their kids to speak english because they don't want to lose their culture. I have no culture because I was brought here against my free will. I went to college in a all white town and was racial profiled every day. U deal with it an get over it! It made me a more tolerant person of others. But to answer your question there will always be some racism in the US. Especially with African and black people who were raised here. So much so that I don't support their businesses because they are rude and stink. It may not be all of them but the ones that I have some across do. Call me racist I am also racist to other black people because they do some of the most ignorant s*hit I have seen in my life. Like if one more crackhead ask me for money in my community I am going to flip. When I leave in the morning they are one the corner when I come home they are on the corner. Go get a job.

zFZ6QQ1raa	First of all Messiah said it is law full to do good on the Sabbath. If your donkey falls into a pit, get it out. It isn't mercifull to have your donkey struggling and getting all stressed out to get out of the pit, and the stress the animal would go through would probably kill it, Stress kills.   You must first ask your self 1) why am I donating 2) is it an emergency 3) can it wait till the next day.   Now If it is needed and its an emergency, then go ahead and donate it for free. Some people sell their blood for extra cash. This would then be a financial transaction on sabbath causing someone else to work on the sabbath.   If there is no blood available that is already on hand and an emergency arises then by all means fullfill the royal law of love.   If not, then take the day off, Put your feet up and rest and relax.  Please keep in mind that Sabbath is an "Apointment" its a day "Set apart"  to meet with the creator. I personally like to keep those appointments and if I dont maybe he might say " hmmm we got a no-show today"   Just a few points to ponder.|`|mjddqeSraa	Give Blood! It saves a life  Do Religion, Waste of time!   As the phrase goes in Storymakers "IMAGINATION"!|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Of course, that is what keeping the Sabbath is all about, putting aside your own interests and helping others.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	No, it is not allowed.  The blood you give is not immediately used; rather it is tested and stored for future use.  So the exemption for pikuach nefesh does not apply - no one's life would be saved that would not be saved if you gave on a different day.  Pikuach nefesh only applies when one's actions would directly impact on the person's living or dying at the time.  So, eating pork to keep from starvation - fine, eating pork to stay healthy when there is even a tiny amount of other food available, not okay.   Also, giving blood in today's society means generating paperwork - and you are not allowed to write (or cause someone else to write on your behalf) on the Sabbath.      The exception would be if there was an immediate need for the blood within the 25-hour period, and you knew it would be used.  For example if (G-d forbid) someone was in an accident on the Sabbath and the hospital requested family members and friends to donate.    I think it's wonderful that you want to do this mitzvah (and giving blood is absolutely a mitzvah), but the mitzvah of observing the Sabbath is considered higher-ranking in this case.  I am sure you could manage to arrange a time to give during the rest of the week by rearranging your schedule a bit.|`|QdKvj3Exaa	I'm not Jewish, but if that is the only day you can help to save a life, it would be extremely selfish not to.|`|JCnSm91uaa	NO WAY... unless you want to be stoned to death... spiritually speaking, of course!    The first victim of "breaking the Sabbath" was a poor guy who went into the desert Get it? Only in the Bible stories anybody can find sticks in the Arabian desert! The sticks were probably needed in an emergency. Anyway, he was arrested and put in jail. God found out about it right away and ordered Moses to have the guy stoned to death ON THE SPOT! This comes as another afterthought because God forgot to tell anybody what happens with anybody breaking the Sabbath so they can figure the risk!    You have to be a sadistically oriented religious person of the Wesboro class to love this barbaric God!    Numbers 15:32-36 (Infllible King James Version) And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation* (*The Gestapo Christian Police and the whole assembly can work on the Sabbath, but not so the laity!). And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones* (*the bastards didnt wait until Monday or for some appeal if any so they killed him without mercy right on the Sabbath day for Gods own pleasure!), and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses* (*FYI no pedophile was ever stoned in the Bible stories and there were plenty of them!!!)     It shows the barbaric sense of Justice of the Bible writers, but Christians improved considerably thanks to rational secularism proving that we evolve at least intellectually.|`|AA10014750	Yes.

Those who have the simplistic view that a mixture of many cultures is always a good thing should read their history with regard to the Balkins and many African tribes that have been in perpetual wars and ethnic cleansings that resulted in murdering untold numbers of innocent people.  The facts are that a large number of the wars on this earth have been brought about by clashes of cultures.

He is the very essence of the Word (John 1:1) - the Word made flesh.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	Sola scriptura is one of the five solas, considered by some Protestant groups to be the theological pillars of the Reformation. The key implication of the principle is that interpretations and applications of the Scriptures do not have the same authority as the Scriptures themselves; hence, the ecclesiastical authority is viewed as subject to correction by the Scriptures, even by an individual member of the Church.    Luther said, "a simple layman armed with Scripture is greater than the mightiest pope without it". The intention of the Reformation was to correct the perceived errors of the Catholic Church by appeal to the uniqueness of the Bible's authority and to reject what Catholics considered to be Apostolic Tradition as a source of original authority alongside of the Bible, wherever Tradition did not have biblical support or where it supposedly contradicted Scripture.    Sola scriptura, however, does not ignore Christian history and tradition when seeking to understand the Bible. Rather, it sees the Bible as the only final authority in matters of faith and practice. As Martin Luther said, "The true rule is this: God's Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so."    The term Unbiblical is commonly used by Protestants who denounce teachings and institutions that they accordingly view as deviating from Scripture.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	No He didn't Their was no Bible He taught from Tradition Sola scriptura didnt come about till a sex crazed drunken monk by the name of martin Luther invented it in the 1500's    "Therefore, brethren, STAND FAST, and hold the TRADITIONS which ye have been taught, whether BY WORD (verbal teaching), or our epistle. (written teaching)" ---2 Thes. 2:15    "Now I praise you brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ORDINANCES (The Greek text says, 'keep the TRADITIONS'), as I delivered them to you." ---1Cor 11:2    "And the things that thou hast HEARD of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."  --- 2 Tim. 2:2    "By which ye are saved, if ye keep in MEMORY what I PREACHED (verbal teaching not written) to you, unless ye have believed in vain." ---1Cor 15:2    **NOTE** Faith then cometh by hearing     "Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ. But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world." ---Rom. 10:17-18     "If so ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and immovable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which is preached in all the creation that is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister."----Col. 1:23     "And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book ...." --- John 20"30:     "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written everyone, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written Amen."---John 21-25:|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	whatever jesus taught, if jesus ever existed, is not known|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Jesus MAGNIFIED what was ALREADY written in scripture.      So, in a word, he did teach from Sola Scripture if that is what we need to call it.    The OT does not contradict the NT  - God is the same today as he was yesterday and as he will be in the future.    Magnifying what is written is giving clearer meaning to what is already there, so he may have given a more in depth meaning and explanation, yet he NEVER changed what was already written.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	"Sola scriptura" means that the Bible is the sole rule of faith. It does not mean that the Bible dictated to Jesus what He could say. When you say "..already said..." it suggests you mean Jesus quoted the New Testament. This is absurd. There would be no complete New Testament as we know it (all bound together) until the end of the third century. This is very disturbing to anti-Catholics and it forces them to re-write history.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	No, He did not. The origins of the teachings of Sola Scriptura begin with Martin Luther and the reformation.    The problem with this way of thinking is that while all scriptures are good for teaching and instructing and a good means to bring people to the Lord in reality the results say otherwise in terms of beliefs.  Note before the reformation virtually no Christians believed in Sola Scriptura until Martin Luther and the reformation. To illustrate this point to date there are some 30,000+ Protestant denominations who though they revere Jesus at their center, believe and instruct their flock in different teachings. Some believe in infant baptism, some in adult baptism, some in 2 Sacraments, some in none etc. In other words ones beliefs are all over the map in the Protestant world.  How can this be?  Well the answer lies in essentially Sola Scripture is a private interpretation of the scriptures.  So for example one may read the book of Revelations and arrive at a totally different conclusion from ones neighbor or brother and so it is. Hence for as many people as there are reading the Bible there are as many interpretations. This has lead to the proliferation of the false Left Behind Series and incorrect theories such as Amillenarianism, and Pre-millenarianism to name a few.             Even the father of Sola Scriptura (Martin Luther) expressed this point so eloquently some time after the reformation got underway:            There are almost as many sects and beliefs as there are heads; this one will not admit Baptism; that one rejects the Sacrament of the altar; another places another world between the present one and the day of judgment; some teach that Jesus Christ is not God. There is not an individual, however clownish he may be, who does not claim to be inspired by the Holy Ghost, and who does not put forth as prophecies his ravings and dreams.-Martin Luther.    Do Sola Scripture advocates believe in the Trinity? Find it for me in the Bible.    Show me where in the Bible it specifically says Sola Scripture. Those exact words. What?? It isn't there?     "Remember the Word that I have spoken to you."  John 15:20        --------------------------------------...  "But how are they to believe Him who they have not heard? And how to they hear if no one preaches? And how are men to preach unless they be sent?...Faith then begins on hearing, and hearing on the word of Christ." Rom 10:14-17.|`|0sEspN5baa	Jesus 'filled out' Scripture (torah).    He came to FULL FILL the law, not to destroy it.    He didn't break traditions, he taught lessons by  demonstrations and examples so that the  law could be more compassionately applied.    He emphasized the LOVING COMPASSION that  by then was being glossed over  - and He simplified  it all down to two commandments:  Love God with your heart mind soul and strength, your  entirety, your whole being-ness, every particle of who  or what you are from surface to core, and then go  apply this love to yourself and everyone else on this  planet PERIOD>>>>    No, didn't teach anything that wasn't already there,  but did it in a way that all could understand.    Well, actually YES, that ALL ARE EQUALLY  LOVED UNCONDITONALLY BY GOD AND ARE  THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE MOST  HIGH.    That was the difference, no differences mattered.  Only love - gigantic eternal love equally spread  around all of us, sinners and saints alike....  as God is no respector of persons (no favorites)....    thanks for the Q :)  keep 'em coming --

Civilization, however, has drawn women out of their homes, rent their veils, and corrupted mankind. For family life continues through the mutual love and respect of man and wife. But immodest dress has destroyed sincere respect and affection, and has poisoned family life.|`|uzczwVT1aa	Salam. Modesty is important in Islam, and we are commanded to dress modestly and to cover ourselves in the Quran, so thats what we do. We shouldnt judge and say that because you dont wear a hijab, you are now a bad Muslim. Allah SWT knows what your intentions are and whats inside your heart. Its between you and Allah SWT whether you cover or not, or whether you cover more, like your entire face and hands. Its about your faith. We are commanded to wear the hijab in the Qur'an but if you dont want to, and as long as you dress respectfully then we cant judge. And as for music, it depends on what kind it is. Music can be distracting and makes you forget your duties as a Muslim sometimes, such as prayers. Some songs can be crude too, and we shouldnt be listening to them. There are Islamic songs and theyre good to listen to but some people say that other music is haram, while others say it isnt, it depends on what kind of music it is and if its sending an inappropriate or bad message. If they do, then they should be avoided. Hope I helped. Anyway salam alaikom :)|`|s0YY8vnDaa	yes...muslim girls must wear d hijab.....it is very benificial during teenage n throughout d lifetime of  a girl...at teenage u know that u are a dignified woman that u dont allow any man to flirt with u or to exploit u and it very well shows in ur appearance.....it makes u know that u r not giving any hints to any boy of thinking of u in d wrong sense.....also after marriage it is very benificial as ur husband is confident that u r  a chaste woman n dat he is d first man to mingle with u in ahm ahm...that sense ...u know d after marital relationship....so he knows that no man has ever touched u n u r pure....it leads to better n a confident teenage n also a strong marriage because faith is d basis of any relationship n this helps d foundation of d marriage....inshaAllah may u all b guided....regarding music....yes songs that convery wrong meanings or provoke bad feelings r prohibited but  inspirational n islamic nasheeds r not......hope this helps....thank u for posting this qstn!|`|Fv43CHVSaa	Well, you should cover everything except for the face & hands.. (feet should be covered!!!).. just like when you pray    The Hijab is required yes.. you can still wear fashionable clothes like long tops or dresses on jeans & colorful scarves     Music takes your heart away from God & Quran.. if you start reading Quran every night before you sleep (even one page per night), and think about how you will meet God after death, you'll see music is not worth your time|`|0IqeHVauaa	The only authentic scripture of Islam is the Holy Quran and the Quran does not mandate so called 'Hijab' , It only madates 'modest dress and manners'. Certainly no specifications are spelled out by God. All the embellishments to the lone sacred book are the works of men, some not very reputable.  Immodesty does not spring from the attire, but from the human cerebrum.    Likewise about music. I have read no specific proscription against Music except in the Hadiths. It is generally agreed that there are some strong Hadiths and some weak Hadiths, some authentic  and some suspect. and nobody is sure which is which (depends upon which Maulvi you listen to)  Anyone who tells you that on the day of Judgment, God will put hot iron into your ears is simply trying to control you and prevent you from thinking for yourself and read or listen to alternate counsels.|`|2dCcu24waa	i think hijab is compulsory in islam... i wear hijab and its pretty awesome, wearing hijab does make a difference to my life in a positive way. My opinion is that u should start wearing hijab to be on the safe side... being modest which includes hijab is one of the requirements of Islam. After all Allah is the one who created this world and it is our duty to follow his commands. And bdw excessive music is haraam.

03Xx7l8Baa	The holy spirit that you are referring to is known in arabic as "rooh"    rooh means spirit and is known specifically to belong as a title of the angel Gabriel.     The angel Gabriel is the one responsible for sending messages and revelations to the prophets and messengers of God.    Angels are created. Jinns are made from a smokeless fire, man from clay, and angels from light.   Angels unlike the other two creations have NO free will. They cannot chose if they want to obey the order God gave them or not. They simply obey. There is no heaven or hell for them either.    Jinns and humans have been given choice and will be rewarded for their actions, whether the reward of hell or heaven.    Therefore satan could not possibly be an angel and logically there is no such thing as a fallen angel.    EDIT; yea there is only one God. But why do you feel the need to divide Him? The idea of divide and conquer is meant for other issues, but you cannot divide what is One. Some Christians say Jesus, was God incarnate. So Jesus was God in human form. And that would mean that the Spirit is God in spirtual form? Others try to explain it as an egg with a shell, yolk and white. But how manytimes have you found a double yolk? Others yet say that I am john, i am a father, husband and a son. Well some johns are brothers also, grandchild, grandfather, CEO, etc...     Islam makes it clear.  God is One, the Creator, the All Mighty.  The Holy Spirit is the angel Gabriel.  And Jesus of course is a God chosen man to become His Prophet and to guide the people with God's message.  Why do Christians try to mix them all together? I dun understand...|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I'm not Muslim, and I don't believe in the "trinity."    God is ONE.  Galatians 3:20.    Jesus said, "He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father."  John 14:9.    Jesus also said, "He that sees Me, sees Him that sent Me." John 12:45.    Jesus also said, "I and My Father are ONE."  John 10:30.    Isaiah 9:6 says clearly that Jesus is the Son & the Everlasting Father.    Jesus said, "Fear not; I am the First and the Last."  Revelation 1:17.|`|uNu7b21baa	The holy spirit was created by Allah and controlled by him; it's not him: "[97:4] The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by their Lord's leave, to  carry out every command."    Verse 4:171        People of the Book, do not go to excess in your religion, and do not say anything about God except the truth: the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was nothing more than a messenger of God, His word, directed to Mary, a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not speak of a 'Trinity' - stop, that is better for you - God is only one God, He is far above having a son, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him and He is the best one to trust. (Qur'an 4:171, M. A. S. Abdel-Haleem translation)|`|UmdKqP5kaa	JUST DON'T USE FAKE SOURCES DEAR, TRY TO REALLY LEARN ABOUT WHAT YOUR ASKING FIRST:  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	I don't think the implication here is a figure "the Holy Spirit" (note it appears in lowercase); "holy spirit" often means the "will of God" or something similar.  You need to think outside your own box and look at it from their prospective in order to understand it.  What you view as the "holy spirit" and what someone else does (not even just a Muslim), may be two different things entirely.    I'm not a Muslim, but I'm spreading this information anyway.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Now that the Trinity ceased to be a mystery, the Trinity is easy to comprehend and explain.    http://www.trinityunveiled.com|`|Vd8ImkD6aa	=) my name is trinity|`|ybFg4umCaa	They don't say that the holy spirit is a part of god or that jesus is part of god, otherwise they would be giving him part of himself and that doesn't make sense|`|L8tcoABqaa	Yes dear friend you're !00%  rite..|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Almighty God is above having mother and father, relatives or wife.Quran  denies the divinity of those who have offspring and parents and equals; and it is to show that they are not worthy of being worshipped.Almighty God is above all relations which suggest giving birth and being born. He is exempt from having any partners, helpers, or fellows. His relations with all beings are those of Creator. He creates through His pre-eternal will with the command of Be!, and it is. He is far beyond having any relation which is contrary to perfection, or is compelling, necessitating, or involuntary.Almighty God is pre-eternal and post-eternal, He is the First and the Last. Neither in His essence, nor in His attributes, nor in His actions, has He in any way any equal, peer, like, or match, or anything similar, resembling, or analogous to Him. Only, in His acts, there may be comparisons expressing similarity.  The holy spirit mentioned in these verses is Gabriel.Gabriel is an angel.Angels are also created by God like humans and animals.Neither of them CANNOT be a God or a partner/helper of God.Angels only perform their duties according to God's orders.

You can deny the conclusion and still logically accept the truth of the prepositions. The conclusion is not forced.    (1) This is not G = M. It's M *looks like* G. No equivalence is implied. For example, if I were to make a very realistic sculpture of my wife, nobody should think that I was married to material.    (2) S(m) = S(g) would not imply that m = g.

This is the prayer: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian.

7258da4c2329311982666e5727f6ae14aa	I'd keep on struggling because I have a life to live and there is always hope for something better in the future. But, I'm twice her age and I have all that life experience to back my opinion up and she doesn't. If you stop hoping then you are truly lost, if you keep the hope then you will be ready when opportunity present itself to you.     I've been in a situation where I've had to surrender to reality even though it was depressing and destructive, it was a hard thing to do. But I kept the hope and one day years later I found a way out. It's not easy, it's not a fairytale ending and it's most certainly not something that anyone wants to do but it can be done.     Telling her things like "keep the hope", "don't give up", "things will be better in the future" and so is on the other hand useless since they will sound false. How can we truthfully say that the future will be better when we don't know what the future holds? She's depressed and the situation that she's in isn't helping. The problem with depression is that it kills hope and it makes you miss out on things that could have helped you if you had only been in your right mind. I'm guessing that it will be impossible for her to get help with the depression and that makes it all even worse.     All you can do as a friend is to listen and support. Try to give her something to lean on so that she doesn't have to carry this burden alone and try to help her find the positive and good things in life so that she can gain strength from it. In the darkness all you see is dark, there has to be some light, something that makes you lift your eyes and look around for you to be able to get out of a bad situation when you get the chance... or the chance will pass you by in the dark and you'll never see it.

So, you could indirectly ask her if she's attracted to you.  I personally don't think she is, she's just being a really good friend, you said your close, so she's close to you and has no problem with your sexuality. Also, since you like her, then deep inside your wishing she would like you back, so you could be just going through "wishful thinking" & misinterpreting regular friendship feelings.   Good luck hun!

While here on this earth, we are to learn and grow, gain experience and knowledge, and to learn about God.  While acquiring faith and trust in him, we learn the importance of faith and we learn obedience.    Upon completion of our time on earth, we pass on and enter in the next realm of existence, which is life eternal in the kingdom of God.  This eternal life is possible by the merits and love of the only begotten of God in the flesh, his son Jesus Christ.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	You have posed the classic questions of humanity:  Where did I come from?  Why am I here?  Where am I going?  Know this, that you are a spirit being inside a mortal body.  You lived in the presence of our Heavenly Father, God, and were a participant in the decision to come to earth and accept God's plan for His children.  He desired that His children should gain a mortal body and be tried in this condition to see if we would recognize His teachings and follow them, to live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God or from the mouth of His servants, the prophets.  We are here to learn by the exercise of our agency the difference between right and wrong.  We are here to learn to eschew evil and cling to good.  We are here to follow Christ, our Savior, and to reject the adversary, Satan or Lucifer.  If we are faithful, obedient, accepting Christ and following His commandments, then we will be received back into the Father's presence to continue our eternal progression in the next stage of our existence.  We will die physically but our spirits continue.  Eventually, we will be resurrected, our spirits will again regain the physical but now immortal frame and receive an eternal reward for our labors here on earth.  We will then continue to serve our God and perhaps become like Him and have an eternal family with worlds of our own.  We have been promised that we can become joint heirs with Christ in the Father's Kingdom and have all that the Father has.  Thus, you see that we have an origin with God and a future with Him as well.  This test in mortality is but a small portion of our existence.  It is a learning experience.  Don't take it lightly.

We are here as a part of our Heavenly Father's Plan of Salvation.  Before we lived on Earth, we lived in Heaven with God the Father.  We saw that he had a body of flesh and blood, and we were merely spirits.  We desired to recieve a mortal body, and as any father would, God did His best to give us what we wanted.  He created a plan by which we could gain a mortal body.  We would be born on Earth, with no recollection of what Heaven was like (done on purpose, if you remembered Heaven, you would be killing yourself to get back!).  On the Earth, we are in a state of probation, being tested, if you will.  One the Earth we were told to follow the commandments of God, to live our lives worthily, partake of ordinances, and endure to the end.  We are here to prove to our Father in Heaven that we love Him, that we will do as He asks, and that we will do our best to return to Him.  After we die, our spirits leave our bodies, and we enter what is known as the "Spirit World" consisting of two parts.  Spiritual Paradise is for the spirits of those who lived life as best as they could, following the commandments and believing in Christ our Lord.  We know that nobody is perfect, so our shortcomings are made up for through the grace of Christ.  Spirit Prison is for the souls of those who did wicked deeds, didn't follow the commandments, and/or denied Christ.  In Spirit Prison, you will suffer for your sins if you denied Christ's Atonement, and are given a chance to repent, or live in your sins.  After a period of time, after Christ returns to the Earth again, we will all be ressurected, just as Christ was, and our bodies and spirits shall be reunited.  At that time, we will be judged of God, by both our faith and our works.  There are three Kingdoms of Heaven that you can enter into.  The Celestial Kingdom is for the souls of those who lived their lives in righteousness, believing in Christ, and partaking of His ordinances (baptism, etc.).  It is referred to as the glory of the sun.  The Terrestrial Kingsdom is for the souls of those who lived righteously, but did not believe in Christ.  It is the glory of the moon.  The Telestial Kingdom is for those who did not repent of their sins, who lived in wickedness and denied the power of God, and Christ His Son.  It is the glory of the stars.|`|gf5ysBCnaa	To waste time asking why are we here on Earth?|`|SRFfK0BPaa	Ask God.. he will show you the way    to be here as a result of evolution only to die and be gone for ever makes absolutely no sense.. then there would be no purpose of life for people who live life with a purpose..    everything in this world serves a purpose. from the way our bodies function to the sun.. how can we come from nothing to becoming something out of this life    I don't get it..

See if it doesn't resonate as true to you too.    Plan of Salvation  In the premortal existence, Heavenly Father prepared a plan to enable us to become like Him and receive a fulness of joy. The scriptures refer to this plan as "the plan of salvation"      The plan of salvation is the fulness of the gospel. It includes the Creation, the Fall, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and all the laws, ordinances, and doctrines of the gospel. Moral agency, the ability to choose and act for ourselves, is also essential in Heavenly Father's plan. Because of this plan, we can be perfected through the Atonement, receive a fulness of joy, and live forever in the presence of God. Our family relationships can last throughout the eternities.     We are participants in Heavenly Father's plan, and our eternal experience can be divided into three main parts: premortal life, mortal life, and life after death. As we come to understand the plan, we find answers to questions asked by so many: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go after this life?     Premortal Life  Before we were born on the earth, we lived in the presence of our Heavenly Father as one of His spirit children. In this premortal existence, we attended a council with Heavenly Father's other spirit children. At that council, Heavenly Father presented His great plan of happiness.   In harmony with the plan of happiness, the premortal Jesus Christ, the Firstborn Son of the Father in the spirit, covenanted to be the Savior Those who followed Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ were permitted to come to the earth to experience mortality and progress toward eternal life. Lucifer, another spirit son of God, rebelled against the plan and "sought to destroy the agency of man" He became Satan, and he and his followers were cast out of heaven and denied the privileges of receiving a physical body and experiencing mortality   Throughout our premortal lives, we developed our identity and increased our spiritual capabilities. Blessed with the gift of agency, we made important decisions, such as the decision to follow Heavenly Father's plan. These decisions affected our life then and now. We grew in intelligence and learned to love the truth, and we prepared to come to the earth, where we could continue to progress.     Mortal Life   We are now experiencing mortal life. Our spirits are united with our bodies, giving us opportunities to grow and develop in ways that were not possible in premortal life. This part of our existence is a time of learning in which we can prove ourselves, choose to come unto Christ, and prepare to be worthy of eternal life. It is also a time when we can help others find the truth and gain a testimony of the plan of salvation.     Life after Death   When we die, our spirits will enter the spirit world and await the resurrection. At the time of the resurrection, our spirit and body will reunite, and we will be judged and received into a kingdom of glory. The glory we inherit will depend on the depth of our conversion and our obedience to the Lord's commandments (see Kingdoms of Glory). It will depend on the manner in which we have "received the testimony of Jesus"     Blessings through Knowledge of the Plan   A testimony of the plan of salvation can give us hope and purpose as we wrestle with the challenges of life. We can find reassurance in the knowledge that we are children of God and that we lived in His presence before being born on the earth. We can find meaning in our present life, knowing that our actions during mortality influence our eternal destiny. With this knowledge, we can base important decisions on eternal truths rather than on the changing circumstances of life. We can continually improve our relationships with family members, rejoicing in the promise that our families can be eternal. We can find joy in our testimonies of the Atonement and the Lord's commandments, ordinances, covenants, and doctrines, knowing that "he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come"     Their are also quite a few scriptures in the Bible about pre-mortal existance.  See:  1 Peter 1:20, Jerimiah 1: 4, Romans 8: 16, Job 38: 4, and Revelations 12: 7|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	we are here because of evolution - the point of life is whatever you make it|`|sV4knlUfaa	Ah the very reason God was invented...well done    We humans have this great brain which could be used for all kinds of wonderful things but instead we choose to go on about how great we are and how this life cannot be it for us super beings.

For all of us death is a frightening thing, but when we have a relationship with God, believe in Him through our Lord, Jesus Christ, and learn Who He is by that relationship, we can then trust Him not only to get us through this life, but to be there for us in the next.    Every time we are able to put something into His care, release our hold on it, we are making a step towards giving Him our life.  I used to fear death greatly.  Not anymore.   Thank God!|`|ueP6VXevaa	Accoring to the Bible, we are here for the glory of God, created to to serve Him.  If there were no inturruptions to God's plan, we woud all be happy, content, peaceful, loving which in turn would bring God pleasure.  However, since God's plan was interrupted by the devil, bringing glory to God in the way we live just simply gets harder and to some, pointless.  But eventually, looking at the big picture, I see where we are going to do just what God wanted from the start, live to glorify Him in the earth, made new.    For now, life seems pointless, but it really is not.  Each persons existence contributes to the controversy that is going on between God and the devil.  When we live for a good Godly life, we are siding with God, when we live a selfish, riotious, ungodly life, we are saying we love the devil and side with him and therefore give him happiness to see you destroying your purpose.|`|256t9bIqaa	EXACTLY!    You have just repeated the question of King Solomon.    What is the point of living if we are all going to die in the end?   King Solomon's answer:   "Everything is vanity under the sun.    But if you trust in God, everything you do under the sun has meaning above the sun, and God grants you eternal life so that everything you do while on earth receives rewards in heaven."    In the end the purpose of man is simply to be God's friend.     That's is why God created man.    To be friends worthy of God, these friends must have the ability to freely choose to want God, must be wonderfully made, and must have the ability to always stick by his side.   In order to always stick by his side, these friends have to live forever.    God's purpose for man is not to serve God.   It is not to worship God.    It is not to help others.    But these things will happen on their own when you choose to love God, because when you love God, you love others and you want to serve God in any way possible.        I love God because I have chosen to love God.   I love God not because it's my duty to do so, nor do I love God because the alternative is the lake of fire.    I love God because God first loved me--he died for me on the cross.    Motivation is key.   That death on the cross is both the motivation and the promise by example that like Jesus, I can live forever.    Therein is your answer.   The purpose and the motivation to do good things.|`|kDECE7ETaa	thank you "human" for the que....  we are living i this earth as a visitor you can say,we are living in this life for few days ..you can say for 2 days only...then after death their is life again which is said to be day of judgement in which our judge will be done...  so we are responsible of what we are doing in this world...we are here to worship our Lord only...to obey Him to follow His commands..etc...|`|iJRsJUBmaa	this comes from my gut. not scriptures. we are gods creation so he can give or share love with. if we use our freewill righteously to accept  his love|`|9btru19waa	Eph 2:10 For we are God's masterpiece.

Eph 1:10 And this is his plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ--everything in heaven and on earth.         Eph 1:11 Furthermore, because of Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, [fn] for he chose us from the beginning, and all things happen just as he decided long ago.         Eph 1:12 God's purpose was that we who were the first to trust in Christ should praise our glorious God.         Eph 1:13 And now you also have heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago.         Eph 1:14 The Spirit is God's guarantee that he will give us everything he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. This is just one more reason for us to praise our glorious God.|`|PWankIUpaa	We are here to have a relationship and serve God! We see an ideal of the perfect existence on earth in the first time of Adam before the fall of mankind!      When Adam fell all humanity fell and the whole of Creation fell and was torn and broken as if it were glass. It shattered and man 's nature became depraved and the desire for God was replaced with the desire to make mankind their own gods which is the lie of Satin That caused Eve to sin!    God made a way for us to be reborn into fellowship with Him and he made it free and accessible to everyone!     We are born to die to this earth and while we are here we are to live in the Knowledge and Grace of God to have an existence worth the living!    Most people get side tracked  after salvation because they are not Discipled properly . The loose site of the God they had so much Joy in coming to know in that First Love !  Often they feel lost because Christians have lost sight of the fact that these people are their responsibilities  . These people are their Spiritual brothers and they need the Help of their Spiritual older brothers to flourish in the Faith of God and receive the Fullness of the Life that they have inherited.    This is one of the jobs of a Christian and tha tis to take these people under their wings and teach them HOW to Witness to others , teach them how to read and study the Holy and Inerrant Bible so this new born baby in the Spirit may grow to a Strong Spiritual Being in Christ Jesus!

In Jesus name, Amen|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	JW's don't say "Jesus is not a good teacher", Jesus said it.    Jesus said 'only God is Good', excluding himself from this title.    Was Jesus 'Good' in the moral sense of the word?  yes, but this does not make him God.    Was Barnabas 'Good' in the moral sense?  yes, but this does not make him God either.    -------------------------    So according to what one person answered.    'This proves Jesus is God, because Jesus was good'    This then must also prove that Barnabas was also God.      Talk about misapplying scripture,  Jesus is denying that he is the Good Teacher, not describing himself.      Please quote scripture in proper context.    You are comparing apples to oranges in your reasoning,    Jesus was talking about 'titles'    The expression "Good Teacher" is used in the context, as a title.    Jesus would not accept this title, because only Jehovah is Good.    Jesus at     (John 7:14-16) .?.?.. 15?Therefore the Jews fell to wondering, saying: How does this man have a knowledge of letters, when he has not studied at the schools? 16?Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.      Jesus was teaching not his teachings but his God and Father's teaching, thus he would not accept glory that was not his to accept.    .|`|GrpYjwH8aa	At no time have we ever been taught that Jesus was not a good teacher. We have a book called "The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived" and that is all about Jesus, and also "The Great Teacher", which is about Jesus teachings. Does that say to you that we do not believe Jesus to be a good teacher? Jesus had humility even though he was a perfect human, he did not put himself above others. I think that is where your confusion is. Also, he always gave due credit to Jehovah God, because Jehovah is his father and the one from which he got his teachings.|`|6bC1HnyHaa	His bible say that the comming prophet is Muhammad that's solve the Mystery ,by the way ,this bible is corrupted too|`|mNyhRGowaa	Jesus wants us to keep our attention on whom he was sent by.

Indeed, if Jesus had made such a statement he would be contradicting the Scriptures. There were many people called "good" (agathos) in the Scriptures. As the questioner has shown;     Matthew 12:35, Matthew 25:21-23, Luke 23:50 and Acts 11:24.    The account begins with Jesus responding to a man who called him "Good Teacher." Jesus asks why he had called him, Jesus, good? And then he further clarifies by saying, "No one is good but God alone." Since he was called "Good Teacher," Jesus is referring specifically to the topic of his teaching. The following illustrates show why Jesus made this statement:    "My Teaching is not mine, but His who sent me."    "...and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me."    Jesus is illustrating the principle that all good comes from God. Jesus was a Good Teacher not because Jesus was "good" but because God teachings in him was good.    "For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit without measure."    Human flesh has a weakeness toward sin and good does not come out of the flesh.     "the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."    All good comes from spirit and God is spirit. And this is just what Jesus is getting at here in this passage. He was a man of flesh and any good that he did, or anyone else did, was sourced in God.|`|AZD8J7xMaa	BARNABABS WAS A KINDLY MAN THAT HAD THE HOLY SPIRIT LIVING IN HIM ACCORDING TO THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD.

Yet, he would not accept Good as a title when he was called Good Teacher. (Mark 10:17,?18) This was evidently because he recognized God as the pinnacle of goodness.   You comparing Apples & Oranges.  That line of thinking could also be expanded upon when Jesus spoke these words before Nathanael became one of the 12 apostles.  See, an Israelite for a certainty, in whom there is no deceit.John 1:47.  Miraculously, Jesus had looked into Nathanaels heart, thereby learning much about him. Of course, Nathanael was far from perfect. He had his faults, as do all of us. In fact, when he heard about Jesus, he made a rather blunt remark: Can anything good come out of Nazareth? (John 1:45-51) However, of all the things that could be said about Nathanael, Jesus chose something positive to focus on, the mans honesty.    * I am not speaking of Greek words- obviously you making a Good point on the otherhand showing Jesus Not to be God.  My point is that Jesus was " recognizing God as the pinnacle of goodness    Jesus also said " What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me. He that speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.John 7:16, 18.   Yet  Jesus clearly said: I am the way and the truth and the life. (John 14:6)   How do you Marry both verses?..   It goes back to your Orginal Question...like I said- you comparing Apples to Oranges.   Humility........|`|k03dYskYaa	Jehovah is unique in his goodness. Not long before Jesus died, a man approached him to ask a question, addressing him with the words Good Teacher. Jesus replied: Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God. (Mark 10:17,?18) Now, that response may strike you as puzzling. Why would Jesus correct the man? Was not Jesus, in fact, a Good Teacher?    Evidently, the man was using the words Good Teacher as a flattering title. Jesus modestly directed such glory to his heavenly Father, who is good in the supreme sense. (Proverbs 11:2) But Jesus was also affirming a profound truth. Jehovah alone is the standard for what is good. Only he has the sovereign right to determine what is good and what is bad. Adam and Eve, by rebelliously partaking of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, sought to assume that right themselves. Unlike them, Jesus humbly leaves the setting of standards to his Father.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	JESUS WAS PERFECT...

ZkuYBUByaa	This is a dumb question.  People will ALWAYS have something negative to say, heck they even hated Jesus.  Who cares what others think of you,  your not acting "white" because you don't act like a sterotype of blacks!  This is just a sterotype because I am black and I also am not "loud nor am I ghetto".  You are just being yourself so screw what everyone else says.

First it was blind faith, but as my  relationship with God has deepened over the years I  have an understanding faith that allows me to live  my life a certain way regardless of my circumstances,  and that in itself, has allowed many people to trust  God a little more, feel a little safer, a little more secure  about living fitting life around God instead of trying to  fit God into our lives.....    So faith IS an ABILITY that we hone.  We are all given a measure of it, it's hardwired into us.  What we do with it is up to us.  We can bury it or we  can plant it and watch it blossom and grow.....  individual free will choice here.....    Faith keeps me compassionate towards my fellow  human being....    thanks for the Q :)

He is allowing sin, to run its full course,that it may be completely eradicated from His presence - not to mention the fact, that He created each of us, as a free moral agents. As human beings,we are not forced to do what is right - nor are we forced to do what is wrong.The problem lies,in the temptation to do wrong.Unfortunately,people choose to do what is wrong,rather than what is right.|`|HFZHI8VGaa	My friend is like that! She calls them all kind of name and says she hates them. her kids are bad as hell, but it is no reason to be that mean. She beats them too, I got beatings as a child, but not beat down or slapped in the chest. She says she is going to get help though. I think she treats them like that because she doesn't like their fathers? She has maternal instincts they are never dirt or hungry, but she missed the boat on how to talk to them.|`|FrHVJSB8aa	it sounds like the shouter is stressed and cant deal with it. i have screamed at my own kids when completely stressed out, my mother did to us as kids too. we knew she loved us, my kids know i love them and i expect that the kid being shouted at knows that their  folks love them too. if you are genuinely concerned why not try to break the ice with the shouter and make friends with them. there are lots of reasons parents shout at children- they don't always realise what they are saying until someone points it out-----gently. i am not condoning it but sometimes people just cant cope 24/7.
AA10494763	Well as it was stated before a huge number of homeless are mentally ill people who came off their meds.  Because of awful things people did in the past and lack of funding people have the right not to take the their meds family and the government can not make them as long as they are not a harm to themselves (want to kill themselves) or others (threaten to kill someone)   Another huge part of the homelss popoulation are drug addicts and they want money. I have had people say I am so hungry give me a dollar but i offer to buy the lunch and they say no i want the money. Reason they want money to score a fix  There are homeless people who are not part of these categories (teens who aged out of foster care, people who lost their homes and have no family, etc) they try to find shelters and soup kitchens but  they do end up on the street sometime  I would continue to offer but don't get offended if they refuse|`|P544Sbmqaa	Its not always safe for them to accept things like that.  There are instances of people playing pranks on the homeless by putting foriegn objects in the food.  I have never really heard of anyone putting anything dangerous like weapons, but I have heard of people playing pranks with the food they give homeless.      And of course not all homeless are mentally disabled, but many of them are, so that may have something to do with it.    Many of them may feel that you are being judgement or that they dont want your charity.  If they have to be on the street they would rather survive on their own and dont want the charity.    Or, some of them werent looking for food.|`|FrHVJSB8aa	close your eyes and dont look then. if thine eyes offend thee, then rip them out. what has it got to do with you what these people eat? mind your own business.--- simplicimus is spot on again.|`|frt7Q8YMaa	cos u cook like a retard|`|oPQAPfYXaa	Considering the substantial link between homelessness and mental illness, maybe the fact that you weren't wearing a tinfoil hat when you were offering them your goodies spooked them.  Logic tells you that it is better to accept non-trash food than to eat out of a dumpster, but you need to ask yourself just how much logic comes into play in homelessness.|`|rifjjQ2laa	If I was homeless I wouldn't accept it either, I have too much pride and I would be offended.|`|HFZHI8VGaa	I did that before too. I think they are looking for drugs or alcohol, something they can sell. I gave a homeless man a lunchable, he going to have the nerve that say he don't eat pork (it was ham). What the hell u don't have a pot to piss in and u won't eat pork. Te nerve of some people!
MGoJ7PPgaa	I only take offense in people's beliefs when their ignorance is transformed into action.    For example, if my tax dollars are (in my view) thrown down a black hole towards government funding for a creationism museum, that is offensive.  How many homeless people in the here and now could benefit from that money and be helped right away?    Another example, what if my tax money indirectly supports a church which advocates prejudice against same-sex marriage?  It's like I'm inadvertently supporting a kind of terrorism.  By enabling my money to support such organizations, I'm enabling a church pastor and his congregation to speak and be heard in their air-conditioned church with its vaulted ceiling and subtle ambiance on the supposed evils of something which I don't find evil at all.|`|G169VOqLaa	I believe that religious groups are out to manipulate and take money from the ignorant people.

You can, of course, believe any silly thing you want to -- nobody's going to stop you.  However, your assumption that it isn't hurting anyone is an awfully big stretch...if you kept whatever beliefs you have completely to yourself, then fine, it's not "hurting" anyone but you.  But here you are on an international public forum, telling other people about them.  If you're going to go public with your ideas, it's perfectly reasonable for other people to be public about the validity of your ideas.  Don't want criticism or evaluation of your beliefs?

9mLjDa5kaa	There is only ONE way to be saved, and that is by believing in Jesus in faith alone for salvation, without adding any of our own works.     Heaven is real, it is eternal joy with Jesus!  :)      Hell is also real.  It is eternal torment.  Nobody has to be sent to hell.  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|i6d582PFaa	It takes an abstract thought and the wisdom to separate the spirit from the body.

I will not say that nonbelievers will burn in a fiery Hell for eternity. Faith is still a mystery and I choose to believe that much of Revelation is allegorical, but that the message is true. I'm no biblical scholar and I want to believe regardless of my faith that God is patient and will give all opportunities to the unfaithful to repent and be with Him.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	I believe what the Bible says:    Act 16:30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?     Act 16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.    During the Dark Ages, 50 million Bible-believing Christians were imprisoned, tortured and burned at the stake simply for believing the Truths that were written in the Bible. Would you be willing to be burned at the stake for something you knew was a lie? They died willingly because they KNEW that God was real, and that nothing this world offers could be better than what He offers.

Yes, there is a heaven and a hell too. Be careful. God is the real deal. God is love. Faith in God is a gift from God. If you are seeking God, you can say a prayer to have the faith to believe in Him, preferably by praying with a Christian. Seek and you will find.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	god, heaven and hell are all inventions of primitive human minds|`|UGPiSvhraa	I believe in God and I do believe in Heaven and the Bible teaches that there is a Hell as well. God exists, look at all of the good people around you and know that it is because of God that they exist.|`|AA10404869	Yes, I believe in God.    I believe in His son, Jesus Christ, and that I am saved by grace, my sins are forgiven, and when I die I will go to heaven.    Basically, I believe these things because I have a personal relationship with God brought about by prayer, reading the Bible, and God's response to my prayers and the change He's brought about in my life.  He's there, you just have to ask Him to be a part of your life, and trust Him with your heart-He will take care of the rest.|`|0dyCz1WDaa	Yes God is there and so is the heaven for believers and the hell for unbeleivers|`|AA11489001	Ask God yourself if He is real or not.  Goddoes NOT lie, so I know that HE will move upon your heart to show YOU the truth.      John 3:16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. 19This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."|`|fc201279b728cf66cb3edc5fb588f42eaa	Giving your life to Jesus, and striving to live Christ-like.  Christ-like being: giving to those in need, forgiving and loving etc.|`|1lRlNIelaa	First, I believe in the ancient Gods not the abrahamic one. I do not believe in a heaven nor hell. I believe that we reincarnate and maybe there is a "land of the dead" or something for the time between a death and a new birth. Finally, I would say that yes it is a bunch of crap. However, I won't because it might involve deeper spiritual and philosophical problems and questions and thinking. Though I find the idea of a heaven and a hell and of this God ridiculous to say the least.|`|QdKvj3Exaa	Believe and receive Jesus Christ as the only begotten son of God. He IS our Savior sent down to redeem us from all sin. To teach us how to live. Believe that He is all that He said He is, and accept Him into your life. Surrender EVERYTHING to Him. Hence= salvation.  Once there you will want to obey and serve Him. A wonderful life. Blessings galore!|`|yywRjouyaa	A rocket ship that can travel faster than the speed of light.

I do not believe in god. There is no heaven and no hell, and yes..it's all a bunch of crap.|`|8pQrIL90aa	No my friend, it is all real. I would not lie to you, because as I am a soldier for his kingdom, I stand to be chastened if I teach you outside the boundaries of truth.    You need to have FAITH, then you need to know WHY you must obey, and then you must be committed to seeking GOD out for everything that you do. In this world we all have a assignment, and you will find yours if you come to him.    My friend in the end, so many shall be weeping and grinding their teeth, because the Great GOD wil judge them, Dont be on the losing team, come join the winning team. It not only brings blessings upon you and your family, but upon the USA AS WELL.    THINK BIG.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	No one can wish to go to heaven. God does the choosing. To think otherwise is Foolish.   (Matthew 20:23) He said to them: You will indeed drink my cup, but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.

AA12193600	Item1:  Although we refer to it as a genetic code--DNA is in fact nothing more or nothing less than a molecule which self replicates. It contains information for a chemical reaction to occur in a neutral aqueous media.  Does common salt carry the code to dissolve in water--no--it like DNA is driven by the most probable and interaction of electron orbitals sorted out by the entropic and enery situation. Is formaldehyde coded to react with ammonia--no--it is the interaction of the pi orbitals as well as the energy considerations and entropy situation are such that put them together and they go on their own.  There is no code, no creator.   This is why the monkeys typing the works of william shakespear is inaccurate.  It isn't random chemicals put together like individual letters--it's one set of chemicals is specifically reactive towards another set--which makes it more like giving the monkeys a computer which spits out random words and sentances--still a low probability event--but with trillions upon trillions upon trillons of these reactions occurring every second of every day for 4 billion years--the probablity became 1.      2.  All codes are not created by a concious mind, you are anthropromorphising.  It requires a concious mind to extract information from patterns which occur from either natural or manufactured sources.  For example give me a sample of uranium.  Given the intelligence to understand the decay rate of uranium and the amount of lead in the sample--and I extract the information of how old it is.  It's not coded into the uranium It simply is a function of nuclear processess.  Look at any layering of sedmintary rock.  I can extract information as to what the local environment was years before I was born.  It's not "coded" into the rock but their is information in the rock put there my natural processes.    3.  Since 1 and 2 are not only unproven and incorrect, 3 does not follow|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	it's called "Begging the question"    A tired reasoning method which is fundamentally flawed, start with a premise, then all your evidense will rhetorically point to your pre-determined conclusion... Kinda stupid      So, somebody doesn't know how dna is coded, so automatically "Goddidit"?or "minddidit"?|`|MI53mUKzaa	as a Christian i like it.|`|nFk8FXUwaa	DNA is designed by many other factors that come together to create a form or body!|`|ybFg4umCaa	Codes don't need to be as complex as that to be considered a code. The Fibonacci sequence can easily be considered a code that occurs in nature|`|mNyhRGowaa	It is happening right now here on this site you have the DNA of your father his code of information ( devil) And I have a code of information from God. yours was placed in you by your father and mine by my father.    Holy ------- there are scientists on this site neat too know.|`|IcH5gMICaa	Here is another scientific fact that proves to me there is a God:  Mathematically, it is impossible that there is not another creation that is not a spin off of this one.  So if God created Man in his image, and man was special and pleasing to him, he had to repeat the process to mathematically keep the universe spinning!|`|e4tvh1d2aa	premise two is the weak link.  2) All codes are created by a conscious mind; there is no natural process known to science that creates coded information.    okay, we are making a larg assumption on the words consious mind  every time a cell undergoes mitosis or duplication  it replicates the entire genetic code sequence autonomously, meaning  that it does it without conscious thought.  now to explain evolution again  we will skip a few steps to get tow the first multicellular organism  and dna is present after built by amino acids    it goes and duplicates autonomously and sometimes has an error  this error is a mutation  if it is an error that causes a beneficial change it is kept   and that particular set is passed to the next generation  each generation has a particular error/mutation set and changes the next generation in one way or the other.  it duplicates and chages without a consious mind  thus dna is a code that was designed by error and change  and not a mind|`|ZAiCFKoRaa	As a basic, it should be understood that the Lord created all the sciences, not just the DNA. He knows all things and matter of fact, created all things including the sciences that dictate the motions and interactions between all things. In other words, the Lord created true science, not just true biology but physics, mathematics, chemistry and any other truths.    For He is the cause of the effects. And He above all is rational, logical and mathematical. Only the irrational church system stopped true science not the Lord. They becoming word twisters away from truth, while he has always been an encourager of those who seek more and more. For all things and all sciences point to His creative abilities.    This is why Christian scientists have such an advantage over others, because they tend to see design where others may see luck and chance. They look for the cause that connects, the laws of consistencies that always work. They look beyond and find not just the law but the Lawgiver and MAKER.    Wouldn't you agree ?|`|eb4ae3b4df14df881128b014fc84af33aa	Please my dear friend, do not wait until you stand at the throne of Judgment, to know that God is real.    as long as you and I exist, there will be intelligent men and women who will argue the point.  There will be many convincing arguments for and against.  Accept Jesus Christ as your savior and let those who feel the need to debate do so.  Get into God's Word and with the help of other born again believers, in a good Bible preaching church, come to know the glories that exist for those who know Him.  I once was like you, but when I came to know Christ, it all changed.  My day is rapidly approaching when I will see Him face to face.  That will be the happiest day of my second life. God Bless you.|`|gAGnRHIUaa	An extremely  simple argument  have you been convinced by it?  Goes back to the big bang theory- where did the original particles come from to cause the bang. Where did the void come from etc etc. Intelligent design / creation makes sense|`|xRCynGQqaa	1. DNA is NOT a code. It is also NOT a molecule. It is NOT a language. It is an an information storage mechanism (of a sort).    2. Natural processes (evolution) "created" the conscious human mind. The human mind creates codes.     3. Therefore natural processes create all codes.    Finally, all languages are likewise the result of minds. Human (and animal, if you accept bird calls & chimp pant-hoots etc as "languages").      Therefore all codes and languages occur naturally.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Yes, the universal consciousness. It is not separate from us, that is the illusion of our ego's. A separate all powerfull entity is the illusion of the modality of the Piscean age.     We, all matter and energy as a collective are the universal consciousness... god. We are not a physical body with spiritual aspirations, that is the illusion in action.     We are a spiritual being whose frequency has become dense enough to manifest as matter. All matter is an energy vibrating at a particular dense frequency... that includes us.    This is the frequency our modern scientific surgeons are using to repair damaged DNA.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en...

This is quite easily explained using ribosomes, RNA, tRNA, mRNA, and nucleotides...|`|kkSyz6aoaa	Its a clever argument, but it doesnt state any evidence pointing it was designed by a mind, and it can be observed in creation through simple cell process's.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	OK. Memory. Or Hox genes.    I should add: explicit in your question is that codes are weird, and won't arise by themselves. But this isn't the case: if you watch a neural network learning, you'll often see it develop a code or algorithm to achieve the required result. It does this by itself, because such systems are efficient.|`|hmsMpECkaa	Well, the DNA is only a recording of the millions of years of survival of being an amoeba to a gigantic dinosaur back to a little bird.|`|URO3gDXcaa	lame argument.|`|IQIMyE5Naa	The DNA itself is proof.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	i think it is great. and shows that some scientists do use thier minds to actually think and use logic based on the scientific defintitions that WE have given to nature itself!|`|tW86bOMNaa	The most obvious response is also the correct one. Calling DNA 'a code' is an analogy; it isn't really a code at all and doesn't function or appear like one. For simplicity in explanation it is expressed (pun intended) as a code, but to take that as being literally true would be similar to assuming that there are horses under your car bonnet to produce the horsepower (or any other similar analogy you can think of).    Second, as expressed elsewhere, there are many, many other examples where we might think of 'codes' as occurring. Waves 'encode' information on the sand in the form of ripples, for example.    Need anything more?    ADD - By the way, you might also use the fact that the human genome in particular contains 20,000 protein genes, but the human body well over 100,000 distinct proteins. In and of itself this observation negates the argument that there is a 'code' in operation in DNA.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	Number 2 is an unsupported assumption.

42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	The one proposing usually presents a ring to the other party.   These days lots of couples buy rings for each other, it's really a personal choice. If both ladies want a diamond ring I say go for it.|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Sure. We both wore engagement rings. There's really no standard protocol. Do whatever works for the two of you.|`|3BzVOdzUaa	When I got engaged to my now wife. I had a ring but she didn't, but we both have wedding rings. Getting engaged was a suprise for me, with the ring, and our wedding plans moved so quick that rather than getting her an engagement ring, we put that money toward the wedding. We were only engaged for 5 months. If it was not a suprise I think we would have shoped for rings together. I think once your friend prposes then they can talk about going and getting another ring together or putting to extra money towards a wedding.|`|gCpdLKzxaa	Me and my fianc both wear one. Its really up to the couple.|`|KzNv0gmaaa	I think it's a personal choice.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	It would be nice if both women could wear a ring - but I think that is entirely up to them. It may be that one of them doesn't like wearing rings, but would like to wear a bracelet or necklace that has meaning.    I don't think anything is usual or unusual. It's completely up to the two of them. They could have matching rings or different rings. One could wear it on her right hand and the other on her left. There are no rules.    If I got a commitment ring with my girlfriend, I would like it if both of us wore a ring, since I know my girlfriend wears rings generally. But I would want us each to have whatever ring we liked - not matching rings, because we have different tastes.    Each to their own, I say!|`|gIfBEbkCaa	I think so why not.|`|kcIM501paa	Well, If both want to wear engagement rings then they should go ahead!   It's not about being "accepted" or not, cause no matter what you do, you'll always find people who are against something you are doing. So it's about what they want and what THEY feel comfortable doing :)  I would suggest both wearing an engagement ring :) I would do that myself actually.  Good luck And Congratulations to the couple :)|`|G9R6VZOXaa	Why bother with any?  Is the ring that important?    Another useless (and expensive) straight tradition.

I guess I would have to find out by being nosy. lol.|`|nAuz5YbCaa	That's easy a Chinese comes in a silver tray or polystyrene box, but a Japanese is usually in a plastic tray or rolled into little neat parcels|`|DUicCMGFaa	Are you serious??????? of course you can tell the difference. Well I can at least.      LOL if you said that to a Japanese or Chinese person they wouldn't be too happy.|`|DkgrDbCvaa	Ermmm.... Japanese are paler? You have to remember that over here in England there are barely any asian-oriental people. If i asked you to tell the difference between a French person and a English person you probably couldn't until they spoke!|`|UPOAvfDHaa	japanese seems to have wider eyes and there heads are smaller than chinese|`|96AQZUGyaa	I'm good with names, in regards to distinguishing between Chinese, Japanese and Korean. The names, and family names are all unique between these groups, especially the Japanese.   I can also hear the differences between the languages but I wouldn't know the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese. Going on looks its harder and most the time I'd be guessing.    Seriously though, don't worry about living in the UK. The British society has gone downhill recently. The people there are very bitter about the immigrants flooding into England. Don't take it too badly.
Q6qyfPkRaa	i say sumthing in this macaroni aint cheese!     My son and my nephew did this b4 to my other nephew who chose to hide in the washing machine for sum strange reason(they were playing hide and seek).... the kids realized he was in there and to be funny, they started it. Well needless to say they were a lot older than this like 6,7, and 8, and when my sister heard my nephew screaming(cause he couldnt get out), she ran an opened the door and he was hurt as you could imagine and he wasnt in there but a brief minute like maybe 1 minute or so...So i guess it wouldnt take a minute for a younger child to suffer fatality from the same scenario....but the baby pushing the buttons.. idk like i said sumthing in the macoroni aint cheese on that one!|`|PG7WfGpHaa	It might be like in the story of Hansel and Gretel, where the two little kids managed to push the witch into oven.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no opinion...I wasnt there and TIRH...

Pointing the finger of blame and the 'if it were me...' is really not helpful for anyone because we all react differently - especially under stress.     All that can be done is to learn and to take steps to ensure that no one else falls the same way.|`|AA10166652	While this was a terrible tragedy, I don't think R&S was the proper place for this question......however, I'll give it my best shot to answer it.    Confusion clear up....    1) The article I read said the control buttons were about 20 inches from from the floor; the average newborn baby is about 21 inches in length....the boy was 15 months old. You do the math.    2) It only takes 2 minutes for a person to drown......and this can take place with only a teaspoon of water. If the "blunt-force trauma" cracked her skull, or broke her neck....she died before Mom could reach her.      Yes, it probably could have been prevented.......but it happened. What that family needs now is our prayers, rather than our suspicions, or judgments on "what I would have done different". And, although it is human nature to point out what we think........this mother certainly does not need any of us to suspect her of having something to do with her daughter's death.....I'm sure she's condemning herself, enough.    ?|`|nFk8FXUwaa	Some religion believes that there is always a divine purpose for anything that has happened!

TjrnVFVRaa	It is possible you have a restless spirit in your house, a spirit that is seeking help to make the transition to the next plane of existence. They may have left some unfinished business and need to complete it before they can move on. In general, spirits will mean you no harm.    Here is a site that can help you find out if your house is haunted, and if it is they give you some advice on what to do about it.     http://www.haunted--houses.com/is-my-hou...    Above all, the next time you sense a presence, then relax and banish any fear from your mind, think calm and soothing thoughts. If you sense the presence of a spirit, then clear your mind and see if you receive any thoughts from the spirit, it may be seeking your help!    Maybe you can help the sprirt move on (and out of your houses, lol) to the next level. .|`|FD8I4zthaa	SInce ghosts are figments of the imagination, then no.|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Yes they are aware that we're there and that is why they show themselves to us.

soYTXBKaaa	People have believed in ghosts and spirits for as long as we have existed with rational thought and communication abilities.    As proof, look at cave paintings which can be as long as 30,000 years old.    I think the Chauvet cave in France has the oldest dated paintings.  Mostly animals, but there are a couple of half human, half animal images too, which I would imagine are spirits being depicted as opposed to real half human creatures!    These half human creatures have been a central figure of cave paintings throughout time.|`|m6CIhrgqaa	Pretty much every culture in the world has their own ghost story or belief in spirits...

6EA2VKXnaa	1st wat do u mean u feel like a guy???  If its just u love football talking with food in ur mouth, don't worry about.  But if its more than that i understand u being nervous.    However EVERYBODY goes through a stage in their life when they question who they are and everything.  And if u. R not for sure def do not change gender because u do u will b right back in the same boat questioning if u made the right descion.  I don't no ur friends but allot times after gender change people will lose   their friends because, it will prob b hard to except a such a dramatic change.  And no matter wat u look like on the inside u will aways b the same person on the inside.  Also b hard to find love and get married one day some girls may not b to keen on the idea of marrying A transgender.  Plz do no. Make rash descion.   So my answer would b no i do not think u r transgender from wat u have said.|`|1fA2vtLgaa	I think you're at a point where you're just curious.  And there is definitely nothing wrong with that.

If I had to guess I would think that you are in your teens, and this can be a very confusing time for anyone. Maybe try dressing in different styles and see what makes you most comfortable. From experience with friends that have felt similar to how you are feeling I think it may just be curiosity about the opposite sex. If it were anything else I think you would feel much stronger about your desire to be male. This is really just my opinion, so it would probably be very helpful to go talk to someone who specializes in these matters. I'm glad to hear that you feel open enough to discuss this with your parents, but they are not professionals either. Whatever happens, be yourself and good luck!|`|WPd4MYt6aa	WTF|`|7z5MOpoeaa	Search around for some online blogs or chat rooms or something where transgendered people communicate and talk to them about how you feel. Ask them if they felt/feel the same way and try to talk to people who might have an idea of what you're feeling. Human sexuality is a very complicated thing and gender identification is different than sexual orientation. It's natural to wonder what the other sex feels like. But, again, try to find people to talk to who may know what you are going through.

VxozKUcCaa	There is a section of land North of where I grew up that was used as a body-dump by some criminal elements in the city where I grew up.  At the time the area was rather swampy and there would be at least a foot of water and clay soil over the whole area.  Well the land was eventually sold by the farmer who owned it to a developer.  At the time he sold it there were several bodies found dumped into the water but they were already too badly decomposed for all of them to be identified and the farmer himself never used the land for anything himself.  The clay soil had already decomposed the majority of the bodies dumped in there.  The developer just recently finished building a housing development but now people are starting to spread strange stories of shadowy gang members who are occasionally seen walking through this development.  The stories are probably explainable but people that now live out there and know of the land's history try and make the stories sound like the spirits of the gang members who were dumped in the swamp now haunt the housing development that now rests upon it.

Yet, that dream remains unfulfilledno one has found a way to conquer death. Recently, though, medical research has renewed the hope that a dramatic extension of the human life span might really be possible. Consider what is being pursued in various fields of scientific study.    Biologists are experimenting with the enzyme telomerase in an attempt to overcome an apparent limit to the number of times that cells regenerate themselves. Scientists know that old, deteriorating cells are eliminated and replaced by new ones. In fact, most of the body is renewed several times during a persons lifetime. If the process of renewal could be extended, researchers theorize, the human body could regenerate itself for a very long timeeven eternally.    Therapeutic cloning, a controversial field of research, could theoretically provide patients with new and perfectly compatible livers, kidneys, or hearts for transplantation. Such organs would be cultivated using the patients own stem cells.    Researchers in nanotechnology foresee a time when doctors will introduce cell-size robots into the bloodstream to find and destroy cancer cells and harmful bacteria. Some believe that this field of science, along with gene therapies, will eventually allow the human body to sustain itself indefinitely.    Proponents of cryonics deep-freeze the bodies of those who have died. The idea is to preserve them until medical breakthroughs enable doctors to cure diseases, reverse the effects of aging, and restore both life and health to the dead. The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry calls this concept a present-day counterpart to the mummification of the ancient Egyptians.    THE vast majority of believers in the worlds religions cherish the prospect of eternal life in one form or another. The details may differ from religion to religion, but the hope is basically the sameto live happily in ideal conditions without the threat of death. Is that not what you too desire? How can the pervasiveness of such beliefs be explained? And will the prospect of eternal life ever be realized?    The Scriptures show that the Creator planted the desire for everlasting life deep within the human consciousness right from the very start, from the time he created the first human couple. Time indefinite [God] has put in their heart, says the Bible.Ecclesiastes 3:11.    To fulfill that desire to live forever, however, the first human pair had to accept Gods authority to decide what is right and what is wrong. Had they done so, Jehovah would have judged them to be worthy of life to time indefinite in the home that he had prepared for them, the garden of Eden.Genesis 2:8; 3:22.  Everlasting Life Lost    The Bible record shows that God planted in the garden the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, the fruit of which he prohibited Adam and Eve from eating, on pain of death. (Genesis 2:9, 17) Adam and Eves abstaining from eating that fruit would show God that they acknowledged his authority. Eating from the tree, on the other hand, would indicate their rejection of Gods authority. Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovahs instructions and sided with Satan, a spirit creature who had rebelled against Gods authority. As a result, God rightly determined that Adam and Eve were unfit to live forever.Genesis 3:1-6.    What God had offered was life or death, existence or nonexistence. The result of disobedience was death and the complete end of their existence. It was not possible for Adam and Eve or any of their progeny to keep on living by virtue of a certain magical potion or an immortal soul.*    All of Adams offspring suffered because of his rebellion. The consequences are explained by the apostle Paul. He wrote: Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.Romans 5:12|`|sSjdtI7Eaa	notoriety|`|Ve18FAnGaa	there is only one man who managed to that.  i am talking of course about Achilles.

mOWyzwubaa	Good Question.  there are people from other religions who do not worship any idol , they are strict monotheist, not all christians believe in trinity,nor do they believe Jesus son of god, similarly there are hindus who do not follow diesties and worship them ,they are obedient to their own scripture and God Allmighty.  2:62 ,5:69,Says Exactly that.  the present day organized Islam says NO even if, one believes and follow Quran Alone he/she is a kafir, Hadith books particularly bukhary's book makes him/her a muslim,Quran Alone is NOT sufficient for one to be a muslim.  this belief in itself is a KUFR !!!    every one submits to The Will of Allah Allmighty,voluntarily or involuntarily. wether one Knows or Believe allah Allmighty or does Not believe in Allah Allmighty, Willingly or un willingly thats Not the point. one Can Not escape Will of Allamigty.  Submission is not defined that way ,Submission is being Obedient to Allah Allmighty Knowingly !.  "We Hear We Obey "  submission is surrendring to Allah Allmighty with out arrogance.  how does one become Obedient to Allah Allmighty,by following His Allmighty's Laws, Commands,Orders in Scripture .    here it is 3:18 real shahadah , majority deny this ,they follow their hurairic shahadah,it is indeed Will of Allah Allmighty  that they deny 3:18  out of Arrogance they dont follow 3:18  .    [16:93] Had GOD willed, He could have made you one congregation. But He sends astray whoever chooses to go astray, and He guides whoever wishes to be guided. You will surely be asked about everything you have done.      This is Will of Allah Allmighty ,.this is Not Submission.|`|3E2EQH12aa	i agree with dawn 100% and would also like to add that also obeying the teachings of the prophet Muhammad (saws) is obeying Allah swt Himself... everything from Muhammad (saws) is from Allah. so those who reject his sunnah are rejecting islam and rebelling against Allah|`|hMygg8cnaa	"submitters" = submission to Allah    other muslims = muhammadism    (now, let's count the tds)|`|nS7koC7Oaa	Salaam,    well you missed a very important part of the testimony or Shahada, to declare that Muhammad is Allah's messenger, and this requires believing in him as the seal of the prophethood, Submitters believe that RK is a prophet and this is Kufur, a kafir wont get into Jannah except by Allah's mercy,,    Edit  as for the Hindus, how can we call them submitters?  a submitter is the one who submits himself to the will of Allah, not anyone else    Edit  Hinduism is not a religion of a book, and their belief involves devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others!!!!

Insha'Allah, it is said in the Holy Qur'an that those Jews, Christians and Sabians who practice righteousness, as well as others who do so, will be rewarded for every good deed.    Further, it is said that Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, alone has the right, and the ability to judge correctly and justly who will and who will not be blessed so as to enter paradise and Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, knows best!  Alhumdulillah!     In Hinduism, idol worship and the making of images that "represent" one of the many "gods" worshiped in that polytheistic faith practice is as old as Hinduism itself and is not a recent innovation.    Many Christians so, in fact, worship "idols", praying to images of saints, to sculptures of teh cruxcified Christ and rasing mere mortals as equals to Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala.    Further, idols come in many forms.  There are those who profess faith yet place the accumulation of material wealth and goods above the love of Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, and above assisting their brothers and sisters, caring for the creations of their Lord and serving Him and Him alone.    Insha'Allah, perhaps it is always wiser to seek to serve Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, and to live according to His revelations and teachings as He has revealed the same to us in the Holy Qur'an and by the lived example of the Prophet Muhammad, salaahu 'alahi wasalaam, and as the same is recorded in the Sunnah al Hadiths and allow Allah, Sbuhanna wa Ta'ala to judge as He knows best.      Ma'a salaam.    --------------------------------------...    Insha'allah, remember "Ash hadu an laa ilaha ill-Allaahu, wahdahu la sharika lah..."  Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, is One with no partners, equals, associates, sons or daughters.  Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala is not a plurality of incarnations.  His creation does not contain His essence.  Such is a or the central tenet in Islam.    "Wa ash hadu anna Muhammdan abduhu was Rasuluh", and Muhammad, salaahu 'alaihi wasalaam, is His slave and His Messenger, the Last Prophet whom , in following his lived example as the same is recorded in the Sunnah al Hadiths, we should follow.    Many persons fail to hold to the belief that Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala is One and many more fail to bear witness that Muhammad, salaahu 'alaihi wasalaam, is His Last Prophet.  Alhumdulillah!    Remember your profession of faith.    Ma'a salaam.|`|hFxJ02NSaa	Hindus believe Krishna was an incarnation of Allah, they are wrong on that, Krishna was an incarnation of the Christ soul. Hinduism is older than the Abrahamic religions and is more corrupted because of that.    Please try to remember that Qur'an says Allah gives prophets to different nations and they are not all listed in Qur'an. Qur'an also says (5:48) that the different religions are a test for us.    There are other aspects of Hinduism that are corrupted but they are also right about some things, such as reincarnation and our souls growing through these incarnations to eventually reach a level that will allow us entry to jannah.    5:48 suggests Qur'an is meant to confirm what is correct in those religions and serve as a guide to help you recognize corruptions. It does not say you are supposed to disregard everything about those religions. Qur'an says that Allah causes humans to live again, that is interpreted by most Muslims to be a reference to judgement day, but it is possible it is a reference to reincarnation. There are prophecies of Islam that also affirm reincarnation if they are authentic.|`|9991ac1e2f3f6b18c452d3dcadf92229aa	Allah is the better Judge, I believe that Hindus are very deep in their attitude towards God.  They are sincere in their intentions, and at the end of the day it is your intentions more than action that will be accountable to God.  Only He knows who He will submit into Heaven and for what reason.    Muslims seem to think they have a direct ticket to heaven, and it is with this attitude that they keep making the mistake of pointing fingers at everyone else.  I too used to be one of those people.  I have grown to realise that your faith is no guarantee as to where you will end up, it is your sincerity, pure intentions and loving nature towards the divine and His creation that will even get you close as to even the scent of heaven.  The rest is is dependant on His will only.|`|p5cglKf0aa	Indeed, if the 'I' is not known for what it is, an insubstantial Alif, a thread, a hypothetical line, it may burgeon in concealment under the ground, gradually swelling. It will permeate all parts of a human being. Like a gigantic dragon it will swallow up the human being; that entire person with all his faculties will, quite simply, become pure 'I'. Then too, the 'I-ness' of the human race gives strength to the individual 'I-ness' by means of human racialism and national racialism, and the 'I', gaining support from the 'I-ness' of the human race, contests the commands of the Glorious Maker, like Satan. Then, using itself as a yardstick, it compares everyone, everything even, with itself; it divides God Almighty's sovereignty between them and other causes. It falls into ascribing partners to God on a vast scale, indicating the meaning of:     To assign partners to God is verily a great transgression.11     Indeed, it is just like a man who steals a brass coin from the public treasury; he can only justify his action by agreeing to take a silver coin for each of his friends who is present. So the man who says: "I own myself," must believe and say: "Everything owns itself."     Thus, while in this treacherous position, the 'I' is in absolute ignorance. Even if it knows thousands of branches of science, with compounded ignorance it is most ignorant. For when its senses and thoughts yield the lights of knowledge of the universe, those lights are extinguished because such an 'I' does not find any material within itself with which to confirm, illuminate, and perpetuate them. Whatever it encounters is dyed with the colours that are within it. Even if it encounters pure wisdom, the wisdom takes the form, within that 'I' , of absolute futility. For the colour of an 'I' that is in this condition is atheism and ascribing partners to God, it is denial of God Almighty. If the whole universe is full of shining signs, a dark point in the 'I' hides them from view, as though extinguished.     The nature of man and the 'I' within his nature have been explained clearly and in detail in the Eleventh Word, as indicating something other than themselves. They are shown to be a most sensitive scale and accurate measure, an encompassing index and perfect map, a comprehensive mirror, and a fitting calendar and diary for the universe. Since we consider the explanation in that Word to be sufficient and it may be referred to, we cut short and end the introduction here.

Let me take the blame for u, even though i don't know other answerers will be reading this. I was late to see this question.    Question: Was there a specific founder of the religion (Hinduism?)    Reply:  Hinduism cannot be described as an organized religion. It is not founded by any individual. Hinduism is God centred and therefore one can call Hinduism as founded by God, because the answer to the question Who is behind the eternal principles and who makes them work? will have to be Cosmic power, Divine power, God    Swami Vivekananda wrote:  There are these eternal principles, which stand upon their own foundations without depending on any reasoning, even much less on the authority of sages however great, of Incarnations however brilliant they may have been. We may remark that as this is the unique position in India, our claim is that the Vedanta only can be the universal religion, that it is already the existing universal religion in the world, because it teaches principles and not persons.   [The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, III,   Topic 'The Sages of India']    Swami Vivekananda wrote:  If you want to be religious, enter not the gate of any organised religion. They do a hundred times more evil than good, because they stop the growth of each one's individual development.... Religion is only between you and your God, and no third person must come between you. Think what these organised religions have done! What Nepoleon was more terrible than those religious persecutions? If you and I organise, we begin to hate every person . It is better not to love, if loving only means hating others. That is no love. That is hell! If loving your own people means hating everybody else, it is the quintessence of selfishness and brutality, and the effect is that it will make you brutes.

mOWyzwubaa	how can they justify their ignorance !!|`|5frOVAgSaa	tattooing is haram according to sunnah. holy prophet prohibited marking on animals unless they were for recognition for ownership and also prohibited such markings on ourselves.    and writing the name of Allah on our body, how much ore disgraceful could it be? we go to unclean places, wouldn't that be disgraceful?     EDIT: having no compulsion doesn't mean that u can do whatever u want with the sacred words. hell i wouldn't care if she had any other tattoo, it's her life. but this isn't acceptable.  but then again beating up was not the right thing, but they should have just had that tattoo burnt with laser.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	This is why religion sucks. All religions.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	ISLAM NEVER CALLS FOR BEATING ANYONE, Lady Aisha the wife of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said about him:   "His hand never struck anyone. If he was given the choice between two things he would choose the easier option, unless it involved sin or the severing of family ties".    So handling any problems should never be like this, read more about how a Muslim should behave at:  http://islamqa.com/en/ref/71184    Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|nS7koC7Oaa	It's not a matter of a "holy words" rather having a tattoo, beating her was awful and totally wrong though,,|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	it isn't right to beat any woman no matter what she has done but what do you expect from paki's they are savages|`|kUNhq931aa	The word of Allah SWT is on her back, so when she goes to a filthy, unclean washroom she drags the name of Allah with her.    When she has sex, the word of Allah is with her.    When she is unpure, and has not done wudu, the word of Allah is on her body.    It' is so wrong to get that tattoo. All tattoos are haram.    If she was my daughter I would've slapped her. Not all Muslims think this way...some are more "lenient". But I wouldn't be very lenient.    If she really wanted to Thank Allah SWT she would have done so in prayer and in Zikr...not by disobeying his rule on  harming your body.|`|51892c12506b240500310aefa8daf61daa	Girls getting tatts are the least of Pakistans worries even tho it is haram.

Not sure why the hotel situation opened up a huge question like undeserved suffering, but basically, it's something about how humans are connected. We are either "islands" or we're not. If we were islands, we would miss out on the whole beautiful potential of relationship. Since we are not, we can suffer--an awful lot--from one another's faults or neglect. Why did God decide to give us this huge risk? If you believe in God, then you have to suppose that God is creating something bigger than it all. For instance, the best virtues we know arise either through adversity or in response to someone else's adversity...Oh, wait a minute, DID you respond to someone else's trouble?

7258da4c2329311982666e5727f6ae14aa	She sounds like a bully to me. Someone that likes to cause problems for others and that enjoys seeing others in torment. She's just being more sophisticated about it.     Why are some people like that? Because they feel inferior and insecure and they are trying to hide it by putting others down.     [Quote]  Every time that I would make a mistake, she would look at me with an evil look and then look at her friends with a smirk.   [End Quote]    That part pretty much sums it all up perfectly. She pushed you to make mistakes so that she would look better in front of the others, and she did look at her friends to make sure that they noticed it.     Unfortunately we will run into people like that in life and the best thing we can do is to learn from it and try to avoid them in the future. If they can't be avoided then it's good to know how they are so that we can find ways to shield ourselves from them in other ways.

eTTkAv9Yaa	When other people's life choices affect us it IS our business.    It's because we have let our social conscience go that there are so many problem kids about, people used to look out for each other, for example give the neighbours kid a clip round the ear if found doing wrong, nowadays the parents would be round their house threatening lawsuits or violence!, or check in on elderly neighbours etc.    All this "not my business" is making people selfish and secular.    I think your view is ridiculous, but that's my opinion, and I don't suggest that you have no right to yours, as you seem to be saying.    Edit: the part where you say 'other silly reasons by our government', 'accept other people's life choices', so should we not try and help drug addicts, for example, as it's their choice?  Should we not talk people out of jumping of that tall building who have had a bad day?  Other peoples life choices do count and everyone is entitled to an opinion.  Your opinion seems to be that everyone is entitled to an opinion, as long as you agree with it.    And yes, there are parts of my life, in fact any part you like, feel free to judge it, I can either acept your judgement or ignore you, that is my right as to have an opinion is yours and everyone elses.    Can't you see, it's because of simple things like discpilining a child for doing something minor with a little clip that stops them doing it again, if the parent then comes along and says how her little angel can do no wrong and threatens to sue, how is that teaching the child right from wrong?  People don't go around beating other peoples children.  If it was something major they would take the offending child, probably by the ear, to their parents who used to be glad that their misbehaviour had been pointed out to them.  Not like the lazy or precious parents about nowadays who are bringing up a generation of selfish yobs.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	Yes, and when I ask a simple question and don't necessarily give my views they presume they know which is my view and lecture me!

As for single mothers one has to be irresponsible to deliberately do it at public expense or a bit daft not to practice birth control. Those who no longer have a partner for whatever reason deserve all the help society can give. Stay at home mums are probably doing what is best for their children and have presumably been sensible enough to cost the exercise in advance. At the end of the day people are getting more and more fed up with those who are irresponsible or do not plan their lives sensibly. Why should they be regarded as anything other than a liability?

rThIVk2maa	Hrm, that was uncalled-for. Well, to be fair, he did say that HE would be an alcoholic, so you can treat him with some fake sympathy and say stuff like "oh... my.. i'm so...sorry, I didn't realize you were going through that! Is there any way I can help? I'm so sorry to have brought it up, I know such addictions can be horrible to break"    Then you could have been exaggeratedly careful with him at work, such as whispering concernedly "how are you doing today? Is everything under control?" and other such things.     As it is, yes he made a stereotype, and shoudln't have. You should have responded with "Well not everyone can control themselves." and left it at that. Now your best bet is to let HR handle it.     You've done your part turning in the incident, and now it is not your business any longer and it's not your job to make sure he is punished. I don't think he meant to insult you personally, but he did and should apologize, but don't hold your breath. Just ignore him from now on unless you are working on a specific project. Silence is enough.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	If it happens again, write again. But there probably won't be any change then either. Just try to avoid him as best you can.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I honestly think that you might be over-reacting on this one.  Maybe he just didn't realize that it would be something offensive to you.   By the way you described the situation, to me, it didn't sound like he was stereotyping your race.  It just sounded like A) It was his opinion that living on a reservation would not be enjoyable, and therefore would want to drink all the time, or B) that he was just making a silly comment without thinking first.  You can't hate on someone for having an opinion.  He may not have understood why you are upset.      If he is your friend though, why would you go behind his back and write a letter to the human resources department?  I would only take that step if he repeatedly talked down to me, etc.      I definitely think that you may have over-reacted.  I'm sorry, but thats my answer.    Edit:  In response to your response- with all due respect, you asked the question...Just because I didn't give you the answer that you wanted to hear, it doesn't mean that my answer is wrong.  They way you described the situation really didn't seem like he was targetting native americans.  He could want to drink for a number of reasons.  Now, if he were to say something like...."yeah, I'd be getting wasted because that is all native americans do..yada yada yada" then it would be offensive.      You and I must have different degrees on what offenses us.  My advice, stay away from him if he is that offensive to you.  You don't need to be around people who make you feel bad.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Oh Boy! How rude of this jerk! You mentioned that you gave the HR department your letter and nothing was done, Do you know that for sure? Maybe they spoke to him privately about his unprofessional behavior... especially if he hasn't said anything similiar since. I would just leave it alone. However, if he does it again, then you should speak to someone in person even if you have to go to the big boss.    Good luck!|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I am mature, at least in age.  I ran sober living houses in California for over 20 years, and I am a recovering alcoholic.  The man did not defame Native Americans, he simply said that if he had to live on a reservation that HE would become [most likely] an alcoholic.    Miss,  if someone forced me to go live on a reservation, I would go back to drinking.  This has nothing to do with Native Americans.  This has to do with the boredom of living on a reservation, especially if it was in the middle of nowhere, and getting handouts in the form of welfare payments (at my taxpaying expense, by the way.      Additionally, I would assume you got off that reservation so that you could have a better life.  As far as alcoholism, it is evident that certain races, Native Americans among others, do have a higher incidence of alcoholism whether or not they are on a reservation.  But that simply isn't what the man said.    I am an expert on alcoholism, and hold degrees in English.  I would testify in this man's support in a court of law, and you would lose.

All you can do is write a letter, addressing the incident, and give it to the HR dept or the personnel dept.  Keep a copy for yourself.

This is one of MANY articles (pro Indians, as they use the term in many of the articles written by Native Americans) that I read after Googling "alcoholism reservations of Native Americans".  It would be good for all of you to read who believe that this man's conception of alcoholism on NA reservations is one of the most major problems.  I think this woman asking this question needs to post something in opposition to these facts, and the facts that all people studying and understanding addictions already has an inkling.    What has happened to FREEDOM OF SPEECH in America?  I respectfully think that you are over the top on this one.  Do you think the man set out to hurt you?  Why can't you take what he said literally? That he couldn't deal with a reservation and would drink himself into alcoholism.  What does that have to do with YOU?  Now you've lost a friend, and you've reported a co-worker.  And finally, you are asking for REVENGE that you can put your finger on, rather than letting the HR department deal with it.    Others have told you to let it go, I say the same.  If he's smart, he'll stay completely away from you and never speak to you again, and that is as it should be.    ADDITIONAL:    What ever happened to FREEDOM OF SPEECH?  Seems it doesn't apply much anymore?

I applaud you for writing to the HR Director.  I would suggest to you though, that HR may have spoken with the offender and you simply did not know about it.  Most HR "discussions" are not public.  Most often, first time offenders are spoken with and not fired, so it is unlikely you would be aware of the end result of your letter.

That is what usually happens if it was a first offense. He would probably not admit that even if you asked him. If he continues this behavior, report him again. A second offense, especially after a warning, is taken much more seriously than the first.    Stay professional about it and don't let your hurt feelings undermine your credibility. But don't let him get away with it either. Just keep calm when confronting or reporting him.

I would ignore this one guy.. but in other cases instead of hoping that human resources will discipline someone.. I would take them aside and just let them get a little bit of insight into your culture as a native American.. the more others know about your cultural background the more likely it is that their ignorance about your culture will fade away and they accept you for who you are.. which they should do anyhow because we are all equals.. there is no human race who is superior. but if as children they were not taught by their parents to not be prejudiced against another race they are usually more ignorant about other races and cultures than rude.. or their rudeness often stems from ignorance.. you can change that .. by telling them something about the native American race.. Your race was the first race in America before it was discovered by the white men who took over a large part of the land of the native Americans and they had to move to a reservation...That is an important part of American history to learn about the native Americans.. as they were the first settlers in America before the white men ever set foot in America and chased the Native Americans to live on a reservation and usurped their lands..|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Leave it alone, it has nothing to do with you

He concluded from this that if God needed a cause then God was not God (and if God is not God then of course there is no God). This was basically a slightly more sophisticated form of the childlike question, "Who made God?" Even a child knows that things do not come from nothing, so if God is a "something" then He must have a cause as well, right?    The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be. The answer is that the question does not even make sense. It is like asking, "What does blue smell like?" Blue is not in the category of things that have odor, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created, or come into existence, or are caused. God is uncaused and uncreated - He simply exists.    How do we know this? Well, we know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been existing. That ever-existing thing is what we call God.      ?|`|AA11883252	I am not religious but I use to be, check out Psalms 83:18.

Jehovah is the Creator and, rightfully, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe. Jehovah is translated from the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, ,???? which means He Causes to Become. These four Hebrew letters are represented in many languages by the letters JHVH or YHWH.    Descriptions of his presence. Since he is a Spirit beyond the power of humans to see (Joh 4:24), any description of his appearance in human terms can only approximate his incomparable glory. (Isa 40:25,?26) While not actually seeing their Creator (Joh 1:18), certain of his servants were given inspired visions of his heavenly courts. Their description of his presence portrays not only great dignity and awesome majesty but also serenity, order, beauty, and pleasantness.Ex 24:9-11; Isa 6:1; Eze 1:26-28; Da 7:9; Re 4:1-3; see also Ps 96:4-6.    As can be noted, these descriptions employ metaphors and similes, likening Jehovahs appearance to things known to humansjewels, fire, rainbow. He is even described as though he had certain human features. While some scholars make a considerable issue out of what they call the anthropomorphological expressions found in the Bibleas references to Gods eyes, ears, face (1Pe 3:12), arm (Eze 20:33), right hand (Ex 15:6), and so forthit is obvious that such expressions are necessary for the description to be humanly comprehensible. For Jehovah God to set down for us a description of himself in spirit terms would be like supplying advanced algebraic equations to persons having only the most elementary knowledge of mathematics, or trying to explain colors to a person born blind.Job 37:23,?24.    The so-called anthropomorphisms, therefore, are never to be taken literally, any more than other metaphoric references to God as a sun, shield, or Rock. (Ps 84:11; De 32:4,?31) Jehovahs sight (Ge 16:13), unlike that of humans, does not depend on light rays, and deeds done in utter darkness can be seen by him. (Ps 139:1, 7-12; Heb 4:13) His vision can encompass all the earth (Pr 15:3), and he needs no special equipment to see the growing embryo within the human womb. (Ps 139:15,?16) Nor does his hearing depend on sound waves in an atmosphere, for he can hear expressions though uttered voicelessly in the heart. (Ps 19:14) Man cannot successfully measure even the vast physical universe; yet the physical heavens do not embrace or enclose the place of Gods residence, and much less does some earthly house or temple. (1Ki 8:27; Ps 148:13) Through Moses, Jehovah specifically warned the nation of Israel not to make an image of Him in the form of a male or of any kind of created thing. (De 4:15-18) So, whereas Lukes account records Jesus reference to expelling demons by means of Gods finger, Matthews account shows that Jesus thereby referred to Gods spirit, or active force.Lu 11:20; Mt 12:28; compare Jer 27:5 and Ge 1:2.    Personal qualities revealed in creation. Certain facets of Jehovahs personality are revealed by his creative works even prior to his creation of man. (Ro 1:20) The very act of creation reveals his love. This is because Jehovah is self-contained, lacking nothing. Hence, although he created hundreds of millions of spirit sons, not one could add anything to his knowledge or contribute some desirable quality of emotion or personality that He did not already possess in superior degree.Da 7:9,?10; Heb 12:22; Isa 40:13,?14; Ro 11:33,?34.    This, of course, does not mean that Jehovah does not find pleasure in his creatures. Since man was made in Gods image (Ge 1:27), it follows that the joy a human father finds in his child, particularly one who shows filial love and acts with wisdom, reflects the joy that Jehovah finds in his intelligent creatures who love and wisely serve Him. (Pr 27:11; Mt 3:17; 12:18) This pleasure comes, not from any material or physical gain, but from seeing his creatures willingly hold to his righteous standards and show unselfishness and generosity. (1Ch 29:14-17; Ps 50:7-15; 147:10,?11; Heb 13:16) Contrariwise, those who take a wrong course and show contempt for Jehovahs love, who bring reproach on his name and cruel suffering to others, cause Jehovah to feel hurt at his heart.Ge 6:5-8; Ps 78:36-41; Heb 10:38.    Jehovah also finds pleasure in the exercise of his powers, whether in creation or otherwise, his works always having a real purpose and a good motive. (Ps 135:3-6; Isa 46:10,?11; 55:10,?11) As the Generous Giver of every good gift and every perfect present, he takes delight in rewarding his faithful sons and daughters with blessings. (Jas 1:5,?17; Ps 35:27; 84:11,?12; 149:4) Yet, though he is a God of warmth and feeling, his happiness is clearly not dependent upon his creatures, nor does he sacrifice righteous principles for sentimentality.    Jehovah also showed love in granting his first-created spirit Son the privilege of sharing with him in all further works of crea|`|lOzbR6tvaa	god is simply an irrational man made concept afflicting the ignorant or lazy of mind.|`|a4DRVodfaa	our wild crazy ancestors who were on crack ,, { i dont belive in god}|`|K7N0pkU8aa	this can be endlessly debated- we will never know  I Choose to believe in god...even though somethings may be unexplainable|`|AA12193600	The hebrew god was taken from the sumerian zoasterian and egyptian ra--the hebrews wove many ancient myths into their own evolving religious myths.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	maybe all of us will find the answer someday. until then?|`|V8rV38yfaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah|`|e4tvh1d2aa	okay when god created everything he created time  thus there was no time without him  that is the classic apologetic answer to this question|`|APjnSYKuaa	Originally he lived on Mt Sinai, possibly just as another volcano god, that is until Jethro introduced Moses to him.

Seriously, your question is a good one. The god hypothesis assumes a paradigm of cause preceeding effect, thus the creation theory merely replaces a really difficult question (who created the universe?) with one that would be even harder to answer (who created god?)    Physics makes to assumptions of cause and effect. Before the universe there was no space and no time, so there can have been no cause and no effect. So where did the universe come from?  Well the question is wrong for a start. The universe is ... it just is. But that doesn't explain anyhing does it? No, it does not.    So we don't know.    But just because we don't know doesn't mean we are justified to create a convenient answer, and then burn people at the stake (or prohibit them from holding an elected office) for not believing it.

If you're not, what I can tell you is that I think you feel anger towards your mother, not because she's white, but because of some other reason(s), but you're just using her being white as an excuse.      If you're comfortable being and accepting who you are, then there shouldn't be a problem.  If you'd rather identify yourself as a black man, than a bi-racial person, then that is your prerogative.  However, if your mother has not done anything to you but give you unconditional love, but yet you only despise her for the simple fact that she's white, then you are a racist.  No one can choose who their parents are or change them (in your case the word exchange comes to mind), but people can change how they are by trying to improve themselves(intellectually, spiritually, etc.).    What you need to do is dig deep inside and find the real reason(s) behind your resentment towards your mother.  Remember - parents are not perfect, they make mistakes....some more than others.  If she has not been the ideal mother; the type to be selfish, uncaring and bitter herself (and maybe abusive) then I'd say you had a legitimate reason for feeling the way you do, but if she isn't selfish, uncaring or abusive, then I would say that you have two options, you can choose to change your views and accept her for what she is, or go on feeling resentment towards her.  The choice is yours, but the latter will only leave you feeling bitter, angry and resentful, not only towards her, but to all white people....which boils down to racism.

So, it's sort of hard to know what you are attacking with your snide question.  But you SAID religion; so, that's what I'll answer.    Religion is nothing more than the formal structure of how a group of people come together to worship, pray, elect their church officials, etc.  Think of it along the lines of the bylaws of an organization.  As I said, it gives that part of faith, belief, and worship a formal structure that many feel needs a formal structure.  Rules within religion keep people in check just as laws in society do.      I'll give you an example.  Within my religion, the pastor's salary is set by the church.  We vote on his salary.  It is completely transparent to all.  We also vote on the election of our deacons, elders, etc.  Without "the rules" firmly in place for such actions, the pastor could simply say, "I decided to double my salary."  We might want to say, "You can't do that!"  But without a rule prohibiting it, "Why can't he?"    Likewise, a deacon might "redefine" his role to be that of the pastor.  Again, we might want to say, "You can't do that!"  But without rules clearly laying out the roles, responsibilities, and limitations on the role of deacon, we can't really say much, now can we?    You are surely a member of one or more organizations (be it school, college, a corporation, or club) that has such bylaws.  IF the bylaws within a religion are as you say a form of mental illness then I ask you simply, do you resign from ALL organizations that use this "crazy" structure to facilitate its day-to-day management?    Lord bless.|`|8Ksb1yajaa	of course not!  only chosen by God can understand it because if you hear the words of God and you're chosen you will follow it, if not then you don't. it's simple as that.|`|mS1ODTalaa	religion can be very dangerous.  people tend to judge a belief based on the people who attend a church or the priest or pastor teaching the lesson.  religion is important because it serves to teach people. but people are imperfect and make mistakes.  they will translate something metaphorical and make it literal or vice versa.  I go to church on Sunday's in hopes to learn more. but religion by itself is pointless without the understanding of why it is you are going.  religion should not define your beliefs it should only serve to enhance.  I know of One Truth and that is undeniable.      I am not an aethiest.  Everytime I look into the eyes of my baby girl and see her smiling up at me it confirms even more what I know.  Something that  beautiful wasn't a product of chance or accidental or random combination of dna.      I am a Christian but I believe in evolution.  But life is not by chance it is a perfect plan and I know that because I make mistakes and walk imperfectly that I can still find my salvation in the belief and absolute knowledge that there was a Savior who died for our sins.     I love going to church but i care little for religion.  Don't get caught up on the outside looking in.   There is something there to experience.|`|uUequglyaa	Mental illness is just a name given to people who don't think or behave like every one else,  Many people in the bible heard God speak to them and had visions, truly people who are mentally ill are suffering mentally from traumas of life.

And the mental capacity of the leaders of the masses seems to indicate they know what they are doing, so it might not be an illness any more than it is a subjugation.  It might be a case of misplacement of trust, but the mental illness is more with the people who are not religious.  Look out on the highways every day and there you will see the mental capacity of the masses.  They drive to and fro everywhere everyday and that is a sign of mental illness.

Now cliques are everywhere. You can't trust anyone because you don't know who's talking to whom after work/weekends/holidays. Backstabbing, conniving, etc. Hostile environment.    Not to brag, but I maintained my professionalism, treated difficult, arrogent coworkers the same way and for the most part, ignored them. Believe me, I worked in a snakepit.

27c2bb9e6c0cd80ad4545e11ccf593b8aa	I am a convert to the church for 10 years now. I've not been kicked out and if I'm on probation it's a secret to me. Just from an objective standpoint I'd say it's about the sexual activity while still being married. Separation is a legal term, but isn't a part of marriage..either you're married or you're divorced. Our society tends to accept separation as a norm and individual's actions during that time as their own. That being said..after reading all the comments left below..it really doesn't matter if you had gone to the temple with your first husband because my understanding from two other convert women is that your first marriage on earth is the one you have thru eternity. Now..no other member, male or female, bishop or temple prep class teacher (of which I attended three with my second husband who was an inactive member when we met) none told me this..they did however focus on being sealed as a family. But their doctrine states clearly you must marry in the temple to be sealed as husband and wife. If that is true, than what is this close lipped doctrine about your first earthly husband being your eternal spouse? You see I was married by a minister to my first husband, with no knowledge that I was choosing an eternal partner. The same goes for the second husband. As a matter of fact I was pregnant by another man when I met and married my second husband. And yet no church member, not even the bishop, and I've had three since my conversion has ever told me these conditons on temple marriage. I mean if I'm stuck with my first husband even without marrying in the temple..then what sense does the doctrine make to marry and be sealed in the temple? It's contradictory!! And what about all those little girls in third world countries that are forced to marry at age 9 or so..are they stuck with that man? I too have been pulling away from the church for quite some time. I was separated for 3 and 1/2 years and then we divorced around the four yr mark..during that time i was very faithful with my callings , working hard at tithing although not a full  10%,attended at least 95% of the time and felt fairly confident in my bishop..however, I also noticed that people wouldnt sit in the same pew as me and my son. It became very clear that we were outsiders. The new bishop has been less than kind. He has helped me financially twice, I'm still a single parent not receiving support during that whole time until just recently.He literally will not help me with food assistance unless I fulfill callings, attend church regularly,(since losing my teaching position i had to accept pt work including every other sunday) and pay a full tithe..only to turn around and ask the church for assistance..but he wont assist me with my bills cos i have directv service..which is a contract that he asked me to try and get out of since it was a luxury and he doesnt subscribe to cable himself. So now..I go to OTHER CHURCHES for food assistance!!! What sense does that make? I will say this tho..I do believe the Book of Mormon is true..that it is an account of history and teachings of our Lord and Saviour..but I don't believe alot of the D and C..I think those doctrined are man made! And I felt that for a very long time..even before my divorce. By the way, according to their doctrine..I'm no longer considered good marrying material..I mean why would a good mormon priest holder take a woman who's been married already? right? can't take me to the temple. I know this is very long..but I felt is was a sign that I got this question in my inbox..as I am still struggling with church and the right thing to do for me and especially my son. By the way, I never got to the temple for baptisms..even tho my previous bishop gave me a temple recommend..I didn't feel worthy..now I wish I had gone..just to know for myself first hand. I believe that my God and his son Jesus Christ..which by the way I have always believed they are separate beings even long before my conversion..that they are merciful and want us to learn and return to them. And remember we have the tribulation..one thousand years in the prescence of Jesus and his teachings..or maybe I have that wrong?|`|AA11297267	Well, not because I got pregnant...:)    Yes, I've been excommunicated from the mormon church.  Best thing that ever happened to me.  I was already moving away from the church because I educated myself and found out how much deception there is, how many lies are told, and how silly it all is...  But the funny thing is, them excommunicating me was the final "proof" that there was nothing true about the church.  Without going into details, I was accused of something that I didn't do.  A church "court" was held, the court members prayed for a week for supposed guidance from god, and then excommunicated me.  They told me that god had clearly told them that I was indeed guilty of this infraction.  I knew for a fact that I wasn't.  So clearly if "god told them" I was guilty, then "god" didn't know squat.  That was the last justification I needed to know for certain that they were full of BS.    I know how hard it is to leave -- being a mormon doesn't just mean going to church on sunday, it's your whole life and social structure.  But it really is doable, and it's wonderfully liberating to let go of all the nonsense.  Let this be a good thing, and let it go.  You'll be much happier.   Good luck!    Peace.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no....I left a diff church (cult) after 20 yrs....got sick of legalism....try Methodism...my minister isnt treating us like 3 yr olds..|`|i6d582PFaa	Yes and all they gave me for compensation was a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich!|`|BMQlzUkfaa	I know the actions of your bishop may seem harsh to you, but you were married when you got pregnant by another man even if you were separated.      Hang in there and trust your bishop not the Mormon haters here.  Your bishop is the one who has your best interest at heart.    Now it is up to you to decide what's most important to you.|`|0sEspN5baa	Let's take it further.  My mom's family is mormon.    When she died, I was sent from Florida to live in Utah with my  mormon cousins who, within one year told me that  if I didn't 'convert' and 'join' they would kick me out.    I was 14, I went to LDS church 6 days a week (not  on mondays) I knelt and prayed daily with the family,  but I was too mentally young and messed up emotionally  at that time to understand that my attendance and participation  and love of God and Scripture wasn't enough, I had to 'join'.    So, I was put on a plane over Labor Day weekend with  one suitcase, and sent to Chicago's O'Hare airport,  not understanding that my refusal (which was born  out of fear because of the way I was treated) to 'join'  (remember attendance and participation and a relationship  with God through Christ wasn't enough at an emotionally  stunted 14) where I sat, alone, terrorized, and thinking  I was the most horrible excuse for a human being on  the planet and that I was not worthy of being related to  my family.  My father had never been around.  He happened  to be out of the country and had no idea what the cousins  were doing, nor did I.  It took many many years for me  to undo the damage done by my loving mormon relatives.    Later, scores of years later, I found out it wasn't about  religion at all.  There was alcoholism raging in the  family and that was the excuse to get rid of me, just  another problem.    So while I wasn't excommunicated or on probation -  I was 'removed' from my entire family and had to learn  life by living a sort of 'street life' in Chicago.    I'm sorry for your difficulties.    Thank You God for Your clarity for this woman in this  situation. Thank You for Your guidance and for allowing  her to hear YOU above all else, Lord, above all bishop's  decisions or religious dictates....that she follows You  and is filled with Your Truth mercy and grace, and  thank You for this being so and that it cannot be  otherwise in and through the name nature and power  of Jesus the Christ, it is done, to Your glory God, amen and amen|`|AA10637643	I don't know anyone that has happened to, but I can see why your bishop has done this.  It's more for your good than anything else.  You say "we were not divorced, even though we didn't live together".. sorry but that's not really an excuse.  You weren't divorced.  Period.  In the eyes of God, you were still married and adultery is a BIG no-no.  I am sure you will have to go through a repentance process...    I do have a good friend who is disfellowshipped because he had been on a mission, so obvisouly made temple covenants, and broke those covenants.  There are consequences for our actions, especially when covenants have been made and broken.  I don't know if you had been through the temple or not... but take this time to reflect on the gospel, lean on the Lord and even your bishop for help.  I hope everything works out for you.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	consider yourself lucky and see this as an opportunity to permanently free yourself from delusional belief|`|XJ9oSR2daa	My friend was for a felony.|`|kDECE7ETaa	im really sorry...:( no idea about that|`|AA11489001	This is how you know that the MAN MADE church of mormon is NOT representing God...

Not to mention the whole mormon church was founded by men that coveted their members wives.  The wives HAD TO comply with being sexual toys for the founders and the husbands were NOT told about it . Once the husbands find out, many of the members KNEW the  wrongness of the whole mormon myth.  You can NOT mix the real bible into false teachings.      Find a church of the gospels that does NOT "kick you out".  Christ IS the answer.|`|AA12383652	Ummm you were probably put on probation mainly for having premarital sex.

5RH9Osdsaa	Wow.  Kudos to you for helping your brother out.  If you haven't experienced it before, now you have firsthand knowledge of why so many people struggle with the coming out process and developing a healthy gay identity.    Do you know on what basis your parents are upset about your brother's homosexuality?  Many parents struggle with religious issues, others think they've done something wrong and still others feel their dreams for their child are ruined.  Each of these requires a different approach.  The most difficult one, in my opinion, is religion.    Your brother could try writing them a letter in which he emphasizes that he loves them and will be there when they are ready to talk about what his gay identity means to him.  You could also give them some resources to turn to.  Some great resources are:    - Local chapters of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) or the PFLAG website at http://www.pflag.org.    - If they are struggling with religious issues, there are many supportive groups that consists of religious and lay leaders.  For example, there is Keshet for Jews and Dignity for Catholics.  I am sure there are others out there if you check on the web for your parent's religion.    - Lifetime produced a phenomenal film called Prayers for Bobby which talks about the struggles of a woman whose gay son committed suicide.  Lifetime has a website at http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/p... where you can view the entire film and get helpful resources for LGBT individuals and their families.    - There is a book called "Is It a Choice?" which answers some of the most frequently asked questions about homosexuality.  I would suggest your brother read it first and possibly leave some notes.  Your parents may not be ready for it just yet, because you almost need to start a conversation first.    Your brother is probably going through a lot right now, so it is wonderful that you have offered to take him into your house.  Be there for him if he needs to talk, because there will probably be a whole lot of emotions wrapped up in this experience.  Learn as much as you can about homosexuality, so that you can be an informed resource for him.  You might want to check out some of the resources mentioned above.  The Human Rights Campaign has helpful information for LGBT individuals and their allies at http://www.hrc.org.    Good luck to you and God bless you for sticking with your brother!  Times are changing, but not fast enough for too many LGBT young people.|`|49bQbGfbaa	Don't help him out. Teach him a lesson, that being gay is wrong and weird. I kicked my son out of the house when he came out and I have NO idea where he is now. He's been missing for two weeks.|`|QWMPWia4aa	Wow, it sounds like you're already doing a lot to help him.  Just keep on being supportive and letting him stay with you until your parents cool down is a great kindness too.  He's lucky to have a bro like you, not so lucky on the parents...|`|kwn4xukmaa	Just let your parents calm down First   Iam sure that they will come to   Iam sure they will still love u  when they come to    &   Just be there for him cuz its really hard to do what he did.

Sometimes a break away from parents like that is the best thing|`|YwDbuXOWaa	all i can say is just keep doing what you are doing, help and support him, he is going to need you especially now that your parents ave kicked him out of home.      good luck, and congratulations for being a good brother, i wish you and your brother all the best.|`|GVw4WKaQaa	He's lucky to have you. but i don't understand. your parents aren't talking to you because you're protecting him? its bad enough they kicked him out for being who he is, not harming anyone. but why would they not talk to you? what are they trying to prove?|`|syIp6d2Naa	Wow, your one great brother, just help the kid by finding a place he can stay for a while. Parents need to readjust their entire mind set when a child comes out. It's not a pretty thing to watch in some cases and it sounds like this one will be tough. Contact PFLAG, parents and family of lesbians and gays. They can send you some pamphlets with a lot of good information, not only for your parents but also for your kid brother in how to communicate with parents like yours. I would read through them to because it will give you the needed information to be kind of a referee in this. Again kudos for being there for him.|`|sVkSrUqNaa	that's so sweet that your helping your little brother out      idk     just be there for him|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Like you've already said, have him come stay with you while your parents calm down or work through this. Hopefully, they'll be more open to discussing everything once things have settled down a bit. Keep the communication open. Patience and time.     Kudos for being such a wonderful big brother. Your younger brother has a great role model to look up to, and I'm sure your unconditional love means the world to him.|`|cpQU51teaa	I wish I would have a brother like you...  If the kid is OK about living with you for some period, then why not?|`|9Ks4ByIAaa	You are doing the right thing, maybe you should confront your parents on how wrong they are, because what they are doing is really wrong. But i am proud of you, you are a great big brother :)|`|9a2101ed2f6c0a177128332796fe6a28aa	thanks to both you and your gf!    If parents cannot accept their own son, i really dont know what to do...    just support your brother. it must have taken some courage to come out..|`|7z5MOpoeaa	Help out your brother. Try meeting with your parents and explaining to them that he is still the same person and there is nothing wrong with him and they should accept him. It might be hard to confront your parents like that, but it's the right thing to do.   It's so good of you to want to help your brother so much. Good luck.|`|rDFnsFf2aa	thats so nice of you i wish i had a brother like you just give them time to calm down and hope everything will work out ok best of luck to you.

AA10706879	im an atheist and i had a strong relationship with a christian. we would joke about how i hate god, and how he loved god. we didnt really let our religions get in the way of our relashionship. we would talk about it sometimes, but in the end, it wasnt really a problem. he didnt try to talk me into going to church, though he would ask, and i didnt tell him all the facts against the god he believed in. we didnt last, but it wasnt because of our different beliefs. i think if you truly love someone, things like religion wont be such a big deal.|`|LjsRfaskaa	I have never dated or had a relationship with someone so closed minded and biggoted.

It's just a shame we can't burn thier buildings down to reclaim our holy sites as well... but one day. *grins*.

When we were dating I was completely up front that I didn't believe in god, wouldn't be going to church, and wasn't going to raise my children to be brainwashed into a religion.  I guess she saw enough good in me to accept that, though honestly I think she at least considered that she'd "convert" me over time.  In fact, the opposite has happened.  She's "converted" to my rational lifestyle.  Over time she compared my honesty to the false piety of many at church, and was won over.  She's seen how loving and caring and involved I am with our children, and compared it to the authoritative, autocratic brainwashing many kids in "religious" families get, and she sees the benefits.  She's appreciated my loyalty and devotion to her, while many of the "christian" families who make so much noise about god have suffered through affairs, divorces, physical abuse, etc.  Over the years she saw that much of the "morality" of christians is nothing but window dressing, and that the rewards offered are empty false promises.    I never once pressured her to not go to church, or criticized her religion...though I did point out some of the historical and factual problems with it when asked.  She arrived at these conclusions all on her own, and no longer feels that the "god" she was raised with is real.  She saw the deception of religion for what it really is.    The bible says, "By their works shall ye know them.."  By just being an honest, rational, loving human being, my "works" won out over the hypocritical, pretentious and irrational behavior of the religious folks in my wife's opinion.      Peace.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Agree with first answerer. I have standards.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't. I think I would find it hard. I doubt I'd be able to do it with a serious believer.

But I don't think I'd like having a relationship with somebody I couldn't have those discussions with.    Harriet|`|mLccTAhLaa	My wife believes in God but me and the kids know better.

I can do better than that.    To the atheists who do marry theists and live with them peacefully, all the more power to them. I can't do that.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	I never really had any luck when I was dating.  I found they couldn't just let it go.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but it never worked for me.

Y9DCuWPIaa	The true irish were more victimised. What about when the brits came over here and burned them outta their homes, off their land, left them to die with no livelyhood, no homes, nothing only what they were standing up in.    What about when they made being catholic illegal? When they killed priests for saying mass?    What about when they murdered innocent people?    Oh but that doesnt matter now does it. But yet they get upset when ireland tries to take back..what..belongs...to..them...   The UK never had any right to be in ireland. They brought all this on themselves.    "Oh but its not innocent peoples fault. They live in ireland." Oh yeah, it is. It was their ancestors that were planted on irish soil. Their ansestors that left OUR PEOPLE homeless. THATS the reason they were born in ireland. And, they're all too handy with their petrol bombs too aren't they? But of course they're the victims. How dare the IRA try get the 6 counties back from UK, the nerve!!     Youtube holycross 2001, and look at what absolute scum loyalist bast*rds are. Just look what they done to small children. Then find me a link, that shows the IRA (provisional to be exact)  terrorising small loyalist children.    I don't agree with random bombings, ie. omagh, when there were innocent civillians led into a path of a bomb... thats not cool and i dont support that at all.     But, whine whine whine, cry me a river. Bottom line is, if the unionists werent there, there would be no troubles. They brought all this on themselves.     And. Dont give me all this sh!t about being in the past. It isnt in the past. Those cun*s still use their "lord" or "lady" title. How did they get them? Were they "lords" and "ladies" before they settled here? No.   They got the title when they got the big estates, ie. the irish peoples homes.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	I think you need Politics.

1286cbbdaec7b88444188ebc8781d6d6aa	How is it a risk?    You are supposed to wait until you are married.    Having unprotected sex with your spouse is a risk?  You need either a marriage councillor or a lawyer      ADD:  You were asking about Religious objections to condoms.  Most Religions start off with restrictions against sex outside of marriage, objections against condoms usually come a distant second.    From a Religious standpiont, sex is considered a form of procreation for a married couple.  Having sex outside of marriage was wrong, and having sex while trying to avoid having children was wrong|`|8pQrIL90aa	My friend it isn't the use of a contraceptive that I as a believer object with, but the whole act of fornicating with another just for the soul purpose of physical pleasure. After years of sex, I found that my soul was more accustomed to the rough, brutal animalike part than the what it was meant to be, an act of sharing ones self with another for the sake of love and being together forever through "thick and thin"    Sex is really bad. After 3 years of not having sex I cannot even see myself now having sex for recreational reasons. I still love seeing women, but I love them all for who they are now, not for what i want to get from them. To attain this level takes times, and you will gain the uncommon wisdom that is not readily available in this world. It must be coupled with the bible and the bible only.    So sex at all is bad, when you could show self restraint and seek out purity from yourself from within. When I think about how I used to have sex (which is a word that I hate) it was nothing more than for self gratification, never love.    Don't have sex at all, but I would say to wait, build a love relationship with someone in Christ, then make love for the rest of your life.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Some fundies don't believe in the use of condoms or birth control.

But from a having great sex perspective- without, but hey it is way 2 much crap going around so wrap it up anyway... !|`|XN0cYCATaa	I hear you but I disagree,     sex before marriage is sinful even if you love each other.  Being in love doesn't alter the reality that the sexual act is outside of marriage, marriage being the ceremonial union of a man and woman in matrimony.  Sex outside of marriage is called fornication and the Bible definitely condemns it.        * Matt. 15:19-20, "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders. 20 These are the things which defile the man."      * Acts 15:29, "...that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well."      * 1 Cor. 6:9-10, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God."      * Heb. 13:4, "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge."         So, very clearly fornication is condemned in scripture and there is no provision for it being acceptable just because someone loves each other.  Besides if this couple is so much in love, then why don't they carry out what true love is and marry each other?  True love is when you put another person first, not when you take from them.  For a man and woman to engage in fornication is to declare that such love for the other person is more self centered, than other centered.|`|frt7Q8YMaa	condoms are crappy as they reduce sensation. get a better contraception like the coil or implants|`|mNyhRGowaa	Messing with the future is what it is, the world teaches feeling and sensuality. the use is for life, to use a condom is to deny purpose in your own life let alone the purpose of a newly conceived life.

This  is why they banned the image of a gollywog off those jam jars...because it was time to put a stop to it.    I do agree tho that something so innocent as a cuddly toy should not be seen as a threat to anyone,doesn't matter what colour they are....BUT we don't live in an ideal world and there are people out there who are still very ignorant of ethnic minorities.

Racism exists.You may not like it,or try to pooh-pooh that fact,but it exists.People have prejudged others over just their appearance for thousands of years;it is an us-against-them mentality.A certain group had a need to keep another group down so it started by denying them certain rights,started demeaning them by ridiculing their appearance,ridiculing their speech.This group designed demeaning caricatures of the other group by overly exaggerating physical features like eyes,noses,hair,lips,skin color,all in an effort to keep the "other" subjugated,feeling powerless and disrespected.It isn't just in the UK that this has occurred,in the US it was Aunt Jemima,Uncle Ben,Al Jolson in black-face,certain "comedy" actors. A Gollie isn't just any "colored" doll;it has a history behind it.It is also very telling that you feel the need to defend yourself by saying that your granddaughter has white and colored dolls as well. You know that something is wrong with the doll.If you didn't have a deep-seated prejudice(so deep you don't realize it),which most people do,you are a normal human being,you wouldn't have to make such a point of that fact.  And all of this was and is wrong.This isn't about "political correctness," it is about common decency and commonsense.People are very imperfect beings who need to learn to treat everyone the same way,with decency and respect,something that is known as "common courtesy" but is as rare as that other ephemeral trait,"common sense."  Just because something has been done for years and years makes it right!Segregation laws were never right!But they lasted for years and years.Racism is not a load of rubbish.It is time for everyone who has had the luxury of not being the "other" to at least TRY and see what it is like on the other side.If you wear glasses,do you think it's alright to be called by demeaning names because you wear glasses? If you are overweight,do you think that it is the height of good manners to be called by demeaning mean-spirited weight-based names? Are people this apathetic,this cold-hearted,so without feelings for the plight of other people who are not them?People,being what they are today,only care about themselves.No wonder this world is in such a sorry state.

Having said that I had a Golly when I was a child which I loved dearly and I have grown up hating racism.    Perhaps there should be a nationwide competition to rename the doll, maybe the queen could offer a prize.    It does seem very sad that a doll which many children love should cease to be because at the time it was invented it was given a name which is now politically incorrect.

Dictionary.com defines a golliwogg as:  1. a grotesque black doll.   2. a grotesque person.   3. a doll fashioned in grotesque caricature of a Black male.    I suppose they are not much different to the Cabbage Patch dolls for ugliness and for grotesqueness. Nevertheless, they give the idea that Blacks are grotesque and entrenches racist notions. I can't imagine other races being exhuberant about a doll of themselves similar to the golliwogg dolls. Imagine a Chinese version with slitty eyes, and yellow skin, and so on.

zBqt99avaa	First off:  God love you.  You're in a tight spot.    Okay.  Do you love him enough to spend your life with him?  This is the question you have to answer.  Because everything else is irrelevant if that answer is no.    He is a good Muslim, which is why he wants to wait for sex.  This doesn't mean he doesn't want you as much as you want him.  Don't let his virginity put you off either...    In a society where so few people really value anything, you've found a man that values himself, his religion, and you.  What a gift!    You don't have to convert, and certainly not right away.  If you want to, it is your duty to learn about the religion.  Who better to teach you than your husband?  Leave your heart open to Islam (a beautiful religion), but first, work on the secular issues.    All couples fight.  What matters is how you handle it.  Do you keep communicating?  Do you try to reach a consensus?    It is unlikely he only wants to marry you to please his parents.  The reality is that if a Muslim doesn't go through an arranged marriage (some do), if they fall in love with someone, they marry them, BAM.  They don't usually have a long courtship process like we do.  In my experience, time does not equal happiness.  We all change.  We all can be decieved.  If you love each other, you have as much chance of making it work as you would if you waited.    Although I get asked this myself, and I hate it, ensure he has status in your country before you marry him.    Why do you want to wait for kids?  Do you want to go to school first?  Work?  If you have reasons, discuss it with him, and see if he would be willing to wait a little.  In a few years, you may change your mind, and it would be a non-issue.  At 20 I wasn't ready for kids either , but by 24 I wanted kids, but had no husband, so, still waiting... :)  You too could change.    I agree that you have to meet his parents.  And discuss living arrangements, since it is not uncommon for newlywed Muslims to live with the husband's family.  But what he's saying about how they will have to deal with it means exactly that:  He's telling you he won't let anyone interfere in your relationship.  He loves you so much, that everyone will have to adapt, no matter what.  This is actually a good thing, since he will work on smoothing out the rough spots (because honey, even if you married an evangelical Mexican, there will STILL be rough spots).      But you do have to meet his parents and get to know them a little.  I would say though, you have to decide if you want to marry him first.  Once you know your own heart, you can take the appropriate steps.  If you need a few weeks to decide that, then take a break and really work it out.      E-mail me if you want (as much as you want). All the best.|`|3E2EQH12aa	ah!! text wall!!! ahhh    ok seriously i read it all. ur situation isnt uncommon. . the basics are this: hes not allowed to be with you as a girlfriend, as u have noticed. his parents have a problem with it, and thankfully so does he. i was in the same situation (almost) when i was in my teens too except that the parents did accept me :-p soo anyways, whats the fear of marriage? dont listen to the culture you live in where aside from a beyonce song, marriage is generally something that no one practices anymore. marriage is great, if you love the guy and want it to work out, give it a shot. u dont have to marry him "legally" as in, on paper, in western society. do an islamic wedding "nikkah" and inshaAllah (god willing) that will work out, if it doesnt, thankfully the islamic divorce is not something long , drawn out and expensive.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	No one gets married to please his parents rather than to please Allah and perfect the second half of his Deen, then to please himself,,|`|AA11132696	I will telll you by experience muslims and cristians DONT mix.I married before a morrocan and it was a hell.I was a firm believer that cristians can marry muslims but now I know its IMPOSIBLE.They are very diffferent people .I hate to tell you this but I dont want to see you doing the stupidity I did and suffering horrible.Really find whoever else an indianguy  whatever in this world but no muslim honey it will not work.I tried different times and ITS forget it.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	okay, yea...his parents probably won't be happy that he's been dating and I think it's important that you personally meet them b/c parents are a big part of any Muslim's life..and you need to see exactly where they are in this regard    it does seem that he's quite eager b/c of his age...I think it's more cuz he's starting to feel the pressure and desire for the family himself, and not so much b/c his mom wants him to get married...that's just as side issue at this point.     you should think with your mind and not with your heart for a second:  1. can you really picture the rest of your life w/him?  can you guys communicate openly, even when issues get rough?    2. Why are you going to convert? You have to do this for sincere and true reasons for your kids to grow up in a stable environment..you have to do this for yourself and no one else  it's okay that he's sparked an interest in Islam for you, but you have to make sure that he'll be okay if say, you become more religious than expected...people change, can he handle that?  for some reason those in pre-marital relationships generally tend to assume that their ideal gf/bf will stay the same for ever, but when you take the love goggles off, you realize that people will change and you guys will have to support each other through all of that!    3. sex=wait = good!...if you're good w/the parents + where you think your future is headed + whether or not Islam really is something you can devote your heart and soul to, then get married right away, and sex won't be an issue    4. if you have questions about Islam...you can ask here..but don't rely on too many of the answers...this site is just for opinions...more reputable sites include:  www.sunnipath.com/  www.islam-qa.com/    5. how will your parents feel? try not to break any ties b/c they will be very important if things get rough...    I'd say the first step is to meet parents, be confident and open-minded    :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us.   Islam refuses that men and women live in sin (as well as true Christianity), thus, men and women in love are asked to get married immediately.  Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|4JgSq2rlaa	u call ur a muslim u shud be ashamed of ur self ur gonna burn in the deepest pit of the fires of hell

It's against the law to discriminate against you for being too young or for being too old.    The law about age discrimination only covers employment, adult education and training. There's no law which covers age discrimination in other areas. This means that companies like insurance companies and companies offering financial services are still allowed to discriminate against you because of your age.    Who does the law apply to    The law applies to you if you're in work or if youre applying for a new job. It applies to you if you're an agency worker. It also applies to you if you need to get a reference from a company you used to work for. Your employer isn't allowed to refuse to give you a reference when you leave a job just because of your age.    The law applies to you regardless of how many people work at your firm or how long youve been working for them.    The law doesn't apply to you if you're in the armed forces or if you're an unpaid volunteer.    What does the law mean  The law means that:    Your employer isn't allowed to treat you unfairly at work because of your age - see under heading Unfair treatment at work  Your employer isn't allowed to force you to retire before the age of 65 - see under heading Retirement and age discrimination  Employers aren't allowed to refuse to employ you because of your age - see under heading Job applications and age discrimination  There is no upper or lower age limit for getting redundancy pay - see under heading Redundancy pay and age discrimination  Your employer isn't allowed to dismiss you because of your age - see under heading Unfair dismissal  If you suffer age discrimination, you can make a claim to an employment tribunal - see under heading What you can do about age discrimination.    It is generally against the law for employers to refuse to take you on or to promote you because of your age.    This means that, in most cases, employers should not advertise jobs aimed at certain age-groups.    However, there are some exceptions to this rule. These are where an employer is able to justify that it is necessary to refuse to employ people over or under a certain age.    An employer is allowed to refuse to employ you:    when you reach the age of 65 (or whatever the normal retirement age is in your company if it's more than 65); or  when you reach the age of 65 (or whatever the normal retirement age is in your company if it's more than 65) within six months of when you applied for the job.  Also, there are some laws about the age that you have to be to do certain work. For example, bar staff serving alcohol must be at least 18. Obviously it isn't against the law to advertise for bar staff over the age of 18.    An employer is allowed to ask for information about your age in a job application. However, if you think an employer has used this information to discriminate against you, you can complain to an employment tribunal    Unfair treatment at work    Your employer isn't allowed to treat you unfairly because of your age. They're not allowed to have rules or practices which, although not aimed at you personally, would put you at a disadvantage because of your age. For example, they aren't allowed to say you need to have had 12 years experience after you qualify to apply for a job. This puts younger people at a disadvantage and it's against the law.    Also, employers aren't allowed to bully or pick on you because of your age. For example, they mustn't allow people to make offensive jokes about your age in the workplace.    There are some exceptions to the general rules. An employer may occasionally be allowed to discriminate against someone because of their age if they can show this is justified. For example, an employer could argue that it didn't make business sense to recruit people over 60 when there's a long and expensive training period involved in the job. The person wouldn't be in the job for a reasonable period before retiring. If you don't accept the justification, you can make a claim to an employment tribunal and they will look at each case individually. Not many employers will be able to justify discrimination.    What you can do about age discrimination  If you are being treated unfairly or bullied at work because of your age, take action as quickly as possible.    Talk to someone    You could try telling the person who's harassing you or treating you unfairly to stop, but only if you feel it's safe to this. You may find it helpful to have a work colleague or trade union representative with you when you do this.    You should tell your manager about what's happening and also talk to your personnel department or trade union, if you have one. Put it in writing and keep a copy. Your employer is required by law to try and prevent workplace bullying and discrimination. If the person involved is your manager, you should tell som|`|sxXoLSPxaa	employers must abide by child labor laws. spelling  could be a help.

Thus, Sin does not actually exist, it exists only in a person's mind with a set of pre-conceived moral values. For example, a woman being alone with a man in a hotel room (maybe just discussing some business deals), is considered a Sin from view-point of a strict Muslim. But this scenario is not considered a Sin at all from most other people.    If you have been living a secluded life deep in the Jungles since young with no contact with society, the "Sin" e.g of sleeping with multiple partners, of being homosexual, of killing another person, etc, is not considered a Sin at all. Because, there is no pre-conceived set of Moral Values implanted in your mind.|`|256t9bIqaa	A very good question.    Paul talks about this very subject in the Book of Romans.   Also, Watchman Nee, a Chinese Christian, talked about this in his book "The Normal Christian Life."    I recommend Nee's book.    Nee died in a Chinese jail in the 1970s.       To answer your question, one wants to overcome being a "slave" to sin.       For example, say you want to overcome cigarette smoking.    Cigarettes hurt you.  That hurt makes smoking a sin.   Smoking controls your behavior.   Since smoking controls your behavior, you are a slave to smoking.    What you want is to be free from smoking.   You want to overcome the need to smoke.      Unfortunately, you willl never be able to get rid of the desire to have a cigarette.    That desire will stay with you for the rest of your life.   But you can strengthen the opposing desire to do without a cigarette, and thus overcome the "slavery" to smoking.    This is where the Holy Spirit helps.    When you become a Christian, the Holy Spirit moves into you.   That is God's promise.    The indwelling Holy Spirit, in addition to opening your eyes to many things, gives you the ability to overcome cigarettes.   The Holy Spirit gives you a new nature--a pure nature--God's nature.    This new nature lives side by side with your old nature (which Paul calls the "old man").    Your job is to put aside your old nature and allow the Holy Spirit to do His job.   In order for you to succeed in overcoming sin,  you have to get out the way.        You cannot overcome sin without the Holy Spirit.    You cannot discipline yourself from sinning, because your "Self" is the problem.    The Self is a sinner.   You have inherited the sinner gene from your parents.   We all have.    Trying to overcome sin by your Self is like trying to beat your Self in a game of chess.         While some people are great self-discipliners (and can stop smoking by themselves), the same people are poor at overcoming other sins, or they exchange one sin for another (e.g., smoking for gluttony).    Everyone has their own weaknesses.     We are all weak in some way.|`|MMjbDwE2aa	Sin is - literally - missing the mark.  I miss the mark with my incessant desire to be right.

The greatest of transient things cannot, then, satisfy the smallest faculty of man.  It is, then, this disposition of man -his desires extending to eternity, his thoughts that embrace all of creation and his wishes that embrace the different varieties of eternal bliss- that demonstrates he has been created for eternity and will indeed proceed to eternity. This world is like a hospice for him, a waiting-room for the hereafter.|`|0lpXN8p9aa	It is eternally NOW. What can die, was never living and what is Living will never die...|`|P6atY3xXaa	Some people don't want to live forever as they think things like that.    No we won't be bored.    A lot of how happy we'll be depends on what kind of person we are....if we are one that constantly has to have others entertain us, we might not be so happy.  But if we love God, earth, animals, hobbies, etc. and especially our fellow believers, we will never get bored..we will never see the day when we want to die to get away from it all, nor when we want our friends and loved ones to die.    Isaiah 65  KJV  17For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.      18But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.      19And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.      20There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.      21And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.      22They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.      23They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.      24And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.      25The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.    Isaiah 11  KJV  6The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.      7And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.      8And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.      9They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.     Psalm 148  KJV  1Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.      2Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.      3Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.      4Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.      5Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.      6He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.      7Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:      8Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:      9Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:      10Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:      11Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:      12Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:      13Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.     We don't remember all things always.  Our memory sifts itself.  We can forget and relearn tasks, friendships, etc. if we haven't seen them or done them in a long while.....    Besides, eternal life is not just sitting on clouds or running gold coins through our fingers as so many imagine.  The material universe is to last forever also.  The heavenly ones care for the vast powerful things of the material universe like controling the atmosphere and the earth so there are no earthquakes or tornados/hurricanes to damage the earth.    God's heavenly rulership of the earth will result in many wonderful things.    This life is to do with as one wants...to examine Satan's rulership.  The Almighty does not force eternal life on anyone.  Gen. 3:19, Rom. 6:23, Rev. 20:13, 14.    Debbie

CGxQ9vSuaa	I hold a B.A. & M.E.d. so I can sympathize with your frustration over being a well-educated young woman and struggling with a misogynistic society.  Unfortunately, what I've noticed is that if you happen to be an attractive woman, your chances of being taken seriously lessens as well.  When I find myself in situations where my credentials or knowledge are questioned, I remind myself how successful I am and then proceed to remain professional as becoming 'emotional'  or abrasive will only ignite misogynistic remarks/undertones from said individuals.  Always flex your intellectual and professional muscles in these circumstances as they will also serve you and hopefully deter this kind of behavior for the next woman like yourself.  And stay focused on your goal-at-large regardless of these temporary obstacles because determination goes a long way!|`|yynC47EMaa	You simply need to know what you are talking about, have fresh ideas and know how to bond with people, if you can't do any of those three you are going to struggle.

hceNM6Uxaa	What seems to be important to all too many others is using the Jews as scapegoats for their own unresolved conflicts - so Jews get to carry all the bad stuff they can't cope with in themselves....  Just look at it all getting sicked up all over the answers to this question.    Jews are people who follow the religion of Judaism, and those born to Jewish mothers who haven't converted to another religion.  It is very much a religion of LIFE, of living in the very best way we can, enjoying all the gifts that G-d has provided, celebrating ALL the people on earth and trying to make life as good for all as we can.  We believe that there are different routes to the divine and it is not necessary for anyone to be Jewish.  We have a covenant which we choose to keep (hence 'chosen' people - it would be more accurate to refer to us as the 'choosing' people).  Jews are bound by that covenant but we don't expect others to adopt it.  It's possible but unnecessary to convert.    What else might you need to know?|`|aIakDSstaa	Jews are people, what is important to them depends on the person.

Jews believe in the Old Testament, what they call Torah, but disbelieve Jesus. This might have had something to do with him being one of their own.    What exactly they hold dear depends on the Jew. Usually this is what they perceive to be symbolize their yiddishkeit. Some Jews I have met hold the Torah (5 books of Moses) extremely dear to their hearts, and try to follow its precepts everyday. To others, its the Hebrew launguage, and still others, its the Yiddish one. And yes, Israel.    Whether their Gods chosen people is up for debate, though.|`|aCdya2qkaa	The jews are one of the most oldest religions,  a brief history same people who worked with the romans who never accepted Jesus Christ.

All of the Bible, from the Old to New Testament, shows how God led the Israelites from Egypt to their current state.  For a while, they were in exile due to sin, but God promised that He would reunite them... and they have been.  While the Israelites still believe that God is with them like He used to be, the Messiah has already come and done what He purposed to do..that is to die for the sins of all mankind so that the whole world could be redeemed.  Unfortunately, not everyone believes this..not even most Jewish people...so they keep waiting for a Messiah who is already come and will probably not recognize Him until Jesus returns again.|`|AA11863673	A culture that introduced us to a God partly from their imagination, partly from experience and partly from divine inspiration.  The Bible is a Jewish/'Roman construction that attempts to blur the three distinctions above.  The world sees the Jew through presumptions held to be truth by early church historians whose writings lay the foundations for the construction of the Bible, a book that has been an incumbrance to Christ's teaching ever since.  The Jews are a stubborn necked people like the rest of the world that believes in the power of the law to change the heart of man. What is important to them is no different to what is important to atheists and humanists - a life of security and prosperity. What is not important to them is the blood of Christ - to their and the world's loss.  In view of the impending judgement seat of Jesus' words, fully expounded by Christ, they will be treated no differently from anyone else.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself, TAKE IT FROM A MUSLIM BETTER THAN MISCONCEPTION OF WESTERN BOOKS:|`|kDECE7ETaa	buy Holy Quran for dummies...  history of islam  life of Holy prophet (peace & blessings of Allah be upon him)  story of messengers of Allah.|`|sV4knlUfaa	Try "God is Not Great" by Christopher Hitchens or "The God Delusion" by Richard Dawkins  Try both sides of the debate and give yourself an advantage|`|KPnHxU03aa	hehehe, buy both books and compare it?|`|3WzGf8tJaa	First buy and read a good English translation of the Koran, since it is the foundation of all Islamic cultures.

W89kmvxjaa	the best way to teasingly insult people is to make fun of something they did, rather than their looks or something physical. Instead of saying, "wow, you are fat" make fun of something they do. If someone falls or trips on something say something like "smooth move, sandpaper". (if you make fun of someone who falls, you should also help them up).     The most important thing is to smile friendly so they know you're joking. If they seem to be very insulted say "i was kidding, sorry". Insulting people isnt very nice in teh first place.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	For a gal as big and fat as you, you sure don't sweat much!|`|7ES4xMloaa	passive agressive- for examples look to europe|`|912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	Any insult with a big smile.

AA11872632	My question on Yahoo has been answered! (no expression of time is needed = the present perfect tense).  My question was answered yesterday (a completed time = the simple past)    "He had spoken" should be part of a sentence where TWO actions happened in the past.  One of them happened before the other.  Example:    I had no answers an hour ago.  (one past action)  I have had no answers in 3 hours. (time continues....not finished = present perfect tense)  I checked again, and I had received three answers. (TWO actions..."had received"....happened before, "I checked" in the timeline of these two actions.)  No time indication is needed, but you can add one:  By four o'clock, I had received three answers. (a second action of some sort IS NEEDED!)    I had answered his question (the past perfect tense) before the four-day deadline arrived (the simple past tense)    PS: The Past imperfect tense is "I was speaking / I used to speak......(the past imperfect is for foreign languages, not English. In English it is the 'past continuous')..!  the preterit tense is the simple past tense. "I spoke".  "He has spoken" is the present perfect tense!!!!!  The past perfect tense is "I had spoken" using the past particple.    DON"T make up gibberish rules and words here, please.|`|mC838ZbLaa	It would be according to the past or present tense you are using the statement. Like i would use: My question on Yahoo! had been answered?|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	My students always have problems with this concept because there is more than one tense in the past.      "He has spoken"  is the past imperfect, meaning this was an action that possibly could have been ongoing.    Ex.  He has been to that store.    It's past tense and implies that he may still frequent that store.    "He had spoken" is the preterite tense, which implies that the action has ceased.    Ex. "He had been to that store."  This sentence implies "once" or "but now he shops elsewhere.    What makes English the greatest language in the world is that all words and parts of speach have implications and connotations.  The true definition of any word lies somewhere between its definition and its conotation, all the images that word elicits.|`|s1kMJlZRaa	Looks right to me.

There's no such thing as an undead person. I assume that's not what you meant. But there are people out there who practise vampire culture. They are people just like you and me (with a pulse) that actually drink blood. They don't have powers or anything. It's just a lifestyle.  The concept originated in Romania from Vlad Tepes (the impaler). And even he was a real man - not a demon/undead.  I saw a documentary a while ago about a man who was a "vampire". Obviously he was mortal, but he would drink blood.  You might be able to find it on Youtube.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	only two people int his world have ever gotten the vampire name, the raman kind dracula and the queen who use to bath and drink her victims blood:  http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stu...  ghosts are demons and yes you can have an ability to feel them when they infest a house where something bad has happen or some person has welcomed them into the house, you may be able to see them as well.witches are usually humans unless you have seen demons who took on the form of a witch.|`|Kru3PZbkaa	I believe and can sense ghosts.  I am a practicing witch.  Vampires are 100% complete and utter fiction.  All those people who claim to be are just wannabe's.  Most of them do it for attention.  "Look at me.  I'm the scary, dangerous, but oh so romantic vampire.  All the people of the opposite sex want me and all the people of the same sex want to be me."  What they don't realize is that any one with some common sense knows that they are fake.  Anyone who tells you they've met one, or that they are one, is lying.|`|RIQi2znLaa	first of all "normal" isnt real. im not goth so dont flip out but mabey you should be a little less steriotypical.  yes i have met a real vampre. in fact i am a real vampire. they are not like "twilight" vampires as far as i know those dont exist. the real vampres are humans to. they breathe, sleep and infact they bleed. they are no more or less atractive than anyone else. there are 3 types. sang who feed on blood, psi who feed on emotions, and hybrids like myself who can go ether way. now we do eat "normal" food and it does give us energy but its not the same as "feeding" in the vampiric sense. obviously overtime it gets harder to be a vampire. i mean you cant just go around and drink someones blood. o yes and if somone does get bitten they do not become a vampire. thats  just a myth you are born a vampire and you are awakened in your teenage years. but it does get more difucult. and when u feed of emotions it can/ usualy is draining to the other person. so you cant do it to much because people would start to notice if everytime somone went near you they walked away apithetc! anyways yes my friend vampires are real. they are every where. you may have met one yourself! we come of as generaly "normal" people. as for your "feelings" thats very interesting. next time you feel it try and see if you can see into the spirits life. good luck and feel free to message me if you want anymore info!|`|GuBF5xhDaa	Not in the sense that you see in the movies. They are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn. If you have any questions you can ask me.  http://www.sanguinarius.org/  http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/  http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/  http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm|`|AA10031893	Out of all the zombie and vampire books, Twilight has put the thought of deadly vampires in your head. That's interesting.    There are no vampires because vampirism is a disease. It would spread like an epidemic. And since we're not all vampires, there are no vampires.    You're an idiot to think that crosses and rosary can protect you. As mentioned above, vampires are not some sort of religious demon. They are the victims of a virus so religious emblems will do you jack ****. If you're scared, pick up a shotgun. These things will scare the living hell out of vampires, since vampires are still rational thinkers and know better than to go up front against a shotgun.|`|9c102fdea73d8c5a737ded42999bd51daa	vampire is nothing but a piece of imagination by the irish writer Bram Stoker based on the romanian Emperor Count Drakul aka Vlad 3 the impalor. u ll never ever come across anyone who has seen a vampire. and abt ur extra sensory activities .. u are over thinking stuff. its just that ... u think abt it all day long and watching such movies make u connect with your thoughts and u feel like u have some sort of clairevoyence like power. its like a karate artist feeling the connection with a bruce lee movie. u should try thinking of other stuff and keep urself busy. tht should help .

ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	Hmmm.  I think it's two words.  "White" and "Power."    As a political statement, it seems rather redundant.  Whites control the vast majority of all government, military, and educational positions.  Crying for "White Power" is kinda like calling for "Loud Guns" or "Greasy Engines" or "Ham Sandwiches," things that already go together and don't need advocacy.    Now, the difference between White Power and Black Power or Girl Power, is that these two groups have, traditionally, been underepresented in the halls of power and, therefore, need advocacy, whereas Whites, who have controlled and continue to dominate ever powerful position in the western world (and across the globe for that matter), do not.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	I prefer White Flour|`|Po2UqfvWaa	the same way i do about other phrases that preach hate. that's for all cultures not just the white's|`|ARmhMq5laa	something racist rednecks say.|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	what do you think about white powder?|`|kYgblA7Faa	RACIST|`|ISPIa0n5aa	skin heads|`|2b8c8c5b76146eb48b6b5ff068369797aa	White Power, Black Power, it's all just silly!!|`|xbbEbvxnaa	racist.

It is like any one should have a visa to enter a country other than their own. So the Visa required is that a person should embrace Islam to visit Makkah.    Again, there are strict desciplines and dress codes while visiting and praying around the Holy Makkah, which are obligatory on every Muslim visiting there.    So you can realize that it might not be possible for a Non Muslim to abide by those strict rules and if such non abiding people visit there, it shall disturb the regular Muslims offering prayers.|`|AA11109467	To get into Mecca, one must produce a lengthy legal document from one's own imam proving you to be a Muslim in good standing with his congregation.

There won't be an outcry from us if you ban followers of other religions aswell. Why single out? That's racism.    @Cookie   Where does it say in the Quran or Hadith that non-Muslims in Mecca should be killed?     Also, it's not our fault that you've allowed non-Christians in Vatican. Besides, Catholicism can exist without the Vatican whereas it's difficult for Islam to exist without Mecca.

Viagra for the spam you spoke of, and Rolex because I have a million better things to spend my money on.      Spammers are a scourge on modern society, in the same vein as boom-cars, telemarketers, spyware and Nancy Grace -- annoyances we just have to deal with.  They are a bunch of weasels (actually I much prefer weasels) whose shameless pursuit of easy money with no regard for the cost to others shows they have no integrity.  It causes the rest of us a lot of time, great annoyance, significant money, and possibly harm to our computers, not to mention that it spreads distrust and misinformation, each of which the world has plenty of, thank you.  If there is a hell--and unfortunately I don't believe there is--I hope its ex-spammer residents have the job of checking Hell's e-mail every few minutes throughout eternity... and that they get nothing *but* spam.    If I ever want to take sildenafil or whatever erectile dysfunction drug is around in the future, it will very likely be a Viagra competitor... one who doesn't send daily reminders of its annoying business practices.  I wouldn't even buy generic sildenafil in case Pfizer (Viagra's maker) gets some kind of kickback.  I would go with a different drug and manufacturer entirely.      Cialis (Tadalafil) is different, *and* its spam e-mails are far less frequent in my inbox.  Rolex too, though I do see them regularly.  (And I don't necessarily blame the real Swiss manufacturer.)      And let's not forget the get-out-of-debt schemes and people who "loved" my photo (which is posted nowhere on the Web).    I don't think there's a spammy-products warehouse, though Pfizer may come the closest!  I took the trouble to contact them (courteously but with great clarity) a few months ago about their spam, because I'd read that manufacturers are often behind spam campaigns -- though they may play innocent -- and that we should boycott spammy products or at least complain about them to the makers.  I informed Pfizer that unless they could give a more reasonable explanation for the Viagra onslaught, they've permanently lost a potential future customer in me.      Guess what?.... my Viagra spam increased noticeably after that.  I got no other response from them.  Both of these facts tell me I was probably right to suspect them of paying spammers to do some of their marketing.  If the heads of Pfizer aren't as shady as I tend to believe, they could sure do a better public relations job... starting with a polite answer (or any answer) to my e-mail.|`|zmVCqh7Daa	Now if I were to ask a question like that, I would get reported.

All water animals wouldn't need to be on the Arc. God fetched the animals - 2 of each kind so they could multiply. The arc was built and it was huge. Actually there was a arc of the same size that what is mentioned in the bible and it was found in some mountains. How did a arc so big get in the mountains. Well i think when the see level dropped the arc landed on the mountains.  All the animals that was on the arc was not vicious as God had sent them so - its unlikely that the lion would have fought with other animals.  There is a film called the " Bible " this film goes through the first few books of the bible and it shows in great detail all about Noah and the arc|`|cFaCmYrXaa	Der, didn't you see Evan Almighty??  They just magically appeared out of nowhere and waited in line to get on  :D|`|bxYWJAYNaa	God gave Noah a shrinking ray-gun, and he zapped them all and put them in little jars on a shelf.    And it was only mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. 60,000 species, so 120,000 animals in all.     Remember its not the English word for "animal" that is used in the Bible, the Biblical word for animal is much more limited,   and as for whales, they called them fish, not "animals." And of course, you hardly need to save fish and whales from a flood, do you?    and remind me again, why the hell am I trying to justify a book of myths!?|`|xBfbtwaIaa	Well, if you are willing to listen and not ignore me because of your sarcasim, I have a logically sound concept for you: Natural selection. Lets take this back a few thousand years. First of all, Take all of the sea animals out. Salt water and fresh water are hard to mix, so salt and fresh water animals could have survived. Second, the land animals wouldn't be as diverse as today. Things evolve. I'll accept that. It's a basic principal of nature. It's not scolasticisim to assume that natural selection is possible. That taken into concideration, there would have been far fewer species of animals to have to carry. All dingos, wolves, dogs, and other canines would have been taken care of by one breeding pair. Once the ark landed and the animals were set free, the conditions would have been perfect for accelerated "evolution".   Also, genetic evidence suggests that the entire human species was brought down to a number less than 100 indivuals about ten thousand years ago, so in reality, there is more evidence FOR Noah's ark than against it. :)    I'm ready for Johna and the whale if you want. :) :)|`|b0IYXTcBaa	You should look at the story again. For one he took more than two of every animal. Second, Noah did not go around collecting the animals, God brought them to him. Also, do you not think God could have made it so the animals did not attack each other?|`|H4hI1gXZaa	There was a great flood.  He wouldn't need to get the fish and great whales on the boat because they survive underwater.|`|xA57C03vaa	Let's go back to your question, why do you think Noah would put the blue whale on the ark? Does that really make sense? I thought the blue whale could probably make it in "water", and the other animals of the sea as well. Maybe if you go back and read the accounts of Noah in the Bible, it could clear up some questions for you.|`|AA11564934	make up whatever answer u want, it's a fairy tale.|`|AA11849917	One at a time.    Oh, and it was only 2 of each KIND (and seven of the clean animals), not "millions of insect species", etc.    And whales live in the water!  DUH!  (Or maybe YOU think that because of evolution, that fish can fly?)    It would really help if you actually were to read what you're criticizing before you make say things that make yourself look like the village idiot.    One last comment:  The ark was about the size of three football fields, and three stories high - how many animals can YOU fit on nine football fields???  (Double DUH!)|`|JqHkgWROaa	Not to mention there wasn't just 2 of each kind, there were 14 of many.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Given that there wasn't that many species and he didn't take insects I would figure if God gave him the dimensions of the ark, it was God that sent the animals to him when it was time.

But, about 10 million of them are insects.  I bet Noah left the insects to swim for it.  Enough of them would survive to repopulate the planet. Marine animals did not need to be taken on the ark.  Noah was not required to be stupid.  The remainder of the species of animals would have about the average size of an adult sheep.  Remember, Noah was not required to take the biggest animal of every species he could find.  And, the largest fossil dinosaur egg ever found was about the size of an ostrich egg.  The Noahic flood and the ark are certainly improbably, but certainly not impossible.|`|a5Z1xfejaa	Can you believe people still take this stuff literally?!  ROFL|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	And what about the animals that did not make it onto the ark, such as fish who can only survive in salt water or freshwater? He must have had freshwater tanks to hold all of the freshwater fish who cannot live in salt water. And I don't even know where to start about the land animals who can only survive in certain specific climates, many of which could not have been recreated on a boat, especially not together. And then there's the issue of the animal waste. I think we should consult the director of a zoo and find out how many people it takes to run the place and then have them guess at how many people it would take to run a zoo that had 1 million animals.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	there is no need to take sea animals, I think they survived the flood sinc e it flooded the whole earth, they had water to spare!!!

jfcrxSSBaa	This is a very difficult question to answer, as there are many different legends for each of them.  Some where vampires have many powers and have the strength of ages, and others where they are just merely above zombies, who seek blood.  Likewise, there are legends of powerful, ruthless, intelligent beings known as werewolves, and others of nothing more than large, mindless anthropomorphised wolves.    So...going from the most popular of the legends of each: a lightning-quick, cunning vampire with broad powers vs. an intelligent, powerful, savage werewolf.      Between these two, I would have to say the Vampire, due to its variety of powers and quick speed, it could easily use weapons to take down the werewolf, while the werewolf, although quick, would not be able to land many blows.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	werewolf? the vamp is already dead|`|3t5VZ6zDaa	rambo|`|pTVxGebbaa	vampire, werewolfs are way cooler though|`|XTDeAfTqaa	Technically the Vampire is already dead so he should just forfeit.|`|a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	Wearwolf...The Vampire is already dead.|`|oCsXX96Jaa	To be fair neither will win because a vampire can only be killed by certain objects, same with the werewolf and technically a vampire is already dead??but if i had to choose it would be a werewolf.  =]|`|y3jD0DDpaa	Werewolf, the vampire will turn out to be a teenager who reads way to many twilight books!    my reanaction of what will happen:    Werewolf: Grrrrrr    Vampire: come on wolfy boy eat my fangs!

Werewolves are half-human, half-spirit/demon, which means they are half-lives, its where the powers of the ether can interact with the biological cellular power of which the werewolf's body inhibits.  Werewolves will be immortal for as long as they are in one piece and their body's link to the spirit world is not broken, you can sever that link via damaging the brain and nervous system, however without direct damage to the brain (preventing cellular self (single-body)), the half-life might actually heal itself from any wounds, and the werewolf kind are shape-shifters, meaning they can repair themselves.  Werewolf half-kind take on their own ethereal self (their spirit) and control how their DNA works, however a demonic (possessive) virus would automatically programme the mind into driving these conditions, enabling the werewolf to turn to and from human and werewolf/wolf-kind (hybrid is normally the case, because bone DNA structure cannot be altered so extensively without a strong biological alterative presence in DNA and/or spirit. The werewolf's spirit might actually look wolflike after death because the nervous system's aural image would have been altered during life.  Werewolves may come with magic-like powers, such as super-strength due to advanced ethereal-biological alterations. This means werewolves might have a spiritual sense of immortality.    Vampires could also be half-lives, but I have only come only across dead presences that only remotely have their image-like presence.    Vampires and Werewolves could draw a match, but from the information I have, I have to say the werewolf.  I take my reference from the real lycanthropic kind, not the media kind.|`|eFwiRCcdaa	werewolf|`|LDseDt6Maa	Thats easy.

bxYWJAYNaa	God had foreseen the Fall of Man. He is omnipotent after all. So he designed all of the animals with this in mind, and gave them the attributes of their future roles.    At least thats how it should work following Biblical logic.|`|feee374609370667e619a1891a34695daa	Quite simply, this could've been the foresight of an Intelligent Creator. In the same respect, why is it that many iguanas in various regions have a gland that allows them to release excess salt from their bodies? However, only the ones in the Galapagos actually use it as they hang out in and around salt water and need that gland to sneeze out the excess salt. No other species of Iguana uses it. So, does this prove that the iguana evolved and adapted to it's environment (even when it didn't need that particular structure) or does it show the foresight of a Creator who knew that this particular species of iguana would need it and gave this structure to its common ancestor?

AA11440601	Because Peter needed a bit of a dressing down. The issue was practice not doctrine.    The Catholic Church teaches that the Pope is infallible at closely defined times.    The Pope is only infallible when he, in union with the body of bishops, solemnly teaches that a doctrine as true. This is called "ex cathedra", literally meaning in Latin  "from the chair".    This comes from the words of Jesus to Peter (the first Pope) and the Apostles (the first bishops),  "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matthew 18:18) and "He who hears you hears me" (Luke 10:16).    At all other times the Pope can be just as wrong or sinful as you and me and be in need of forgiveness.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 891: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...     With love in Christ.|`|H7L66ynJaa	The first apostles had equal say.

We know from Peter having denied Christ that he wasn't perfect. The argument as to whether Jesus put Peter in charge is a different argument from whether or not Peter was infallible.|`|mAE7vbX6aa	First of all, I refer you to a pretty good history book called, "James The Brother of Jesus" by Jeffrey J. Butz.  Who explains that the head of the first Jerusalem church was not Peter, but James, the brother of Jesus.  Now, don't be offended, that's not to say that Peter did not eventually become the head of the church after James was martyred, but during those first few years after the crucifixion of Christ, this was a very new religion and things were changing fast.  Peter and James became pretty close and the church was made up mostly of converted Jews.  Paul, on the other hand, went out to teach the gentiles about   this new religion.  There were initially, some difficulties in the interpretation of the teachings of the new religion.  These rules and regs didn't get actually put down until later.  Paul and Peter basically believed the same things, but the differences were in some of the old Jewish rites that were still taking place in the Jerusalem church.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	Paul was his propaganda minister|`|wT9PTRgtaa	peter was never a pope.romans killed him.later pagans started praying to him,mary, and many other saints-which we today know as catholic and orthodox churches.these pagan churches persecuted true christians like followers of mani,paulicians,bogomiles,cathars,walden... and finally protestants.meaning of word protestant is witness.remember jesus said" when  holy spirit come upon you you will be my witnesses(protestants) all over the earth.|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	The Roman Emperor Maintained the title "Pontifus Maximus".    Did you ever read in the Bible of one Christians calling another Father as an honorary title? Search as diligently as you can, and you will find that not even the apostles bore the title Father. No authority for using the title Father for Christians is given in the Scriptures. Indeed, the title is expressly condemned! By whom? By Christ himself! Speaking of the title-loving clergy of his day, Jesus said: They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi [My great one; My excellent one, footnote] by men. But you, do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers. Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for One is your Father, the heavenly One.Matt. 23:6-9, NW.    Did Jesus mean what he said? Certainly! He was not uttering idle words. Does it take a mental giant to understand his command? No, his words need no special interpretation, for Jesus was speaking no parable. He was giving clear-cut instructions about creature-exalting titles: Do not call anyone your father on earth.      Roman Emperor Constantine, who was an early Christo-pagan (Christian) maintained the title  the high priest of paganism, and remained a worshipper of Apollo. His coins were inscribed: "SOL INVICTO COMITI", which is interpreted as "Committed to the Invincible Sun". During his reign pagan Sun worship was blended with the worship of the True Creator (syncretism), and officially titled "Christianity" by the (less than holy) Roman Empire and its' official church the (less than holy) catholic (universal) church.|`|jard50Yiaa	Here is a site for Catholic Christians... you may find some more answers here...    http://christianforums.com/forumdisplay....|`|mBNQrzVlaa	So? Jesus did this with many apostles. Just because he was the Pope didn't mean he was always right, no Pope is. Many make mistakes, Peter did the same. He was human. All of the early Christians however, still recognized the power of St. Peter which Christ gave him.    The Letter of Clement to James  "Be it known to you, my lord, that Simon Peter, who, for the sake of the true faith, and the most sure foundation of his doctrine, was set apart to be the foundation of the Church, and for this end was by Jesus himself, with his truthful mouth, named Peter" (Letter of Clement to James 2 [A.D. 221]).     The Clementine Homilies  "Simon Peter said to Simon Magus in Rome: For you now stand in direct opposition to me, who am a firm rock, the foundation of the Church [Matt. 16:18]" (Clementine Homilies 17:19 [A.D. 221]).     Irenaeus  "The blessed apostles Peter and Paul, having founded and built up the church of Rome . . . handed over the office of the episcopate to Linus" (Against Heresies 3:3:3 [A.D. 189]).     Irenaeus  "The blessed apostles Peter and Paul, having founded and built up the church of Rome, they handed over the office of the episcopate to Linus. Paul makes mention of this Linus in the letter to Timothy [2 Tim. 4:21]. To him succeeded Anacletus, and after him, in the third place from the apostles, Clement was chosen for the episcopate. He had seen the blessed apostles and was acquainted with them. It might be said that he still heard the echoes of the preaching of the apostles and had their traditions before his eyes. And not only he, for there were many still remaining who had been instructed by the apostles. In the time of Clement, no small dissension having arisen among the brethren in Corinth, the church in Rome sent a very strong letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace and renewing their faith. ... To this Clement, Evaristus succeeded . . . and now, in the twelfth place after the apostles, the lot of the episcopate [of Rome] has fallen to Eleutherius. In this order, and by the teaching of the apostles handed down in the Church, the preaching of the truth has come down to us" (Against Heresies, 3, 1:1 [A.D. 189].     Tertullian  "Was anything withheld from the knowledge of Peter, who is called the rock on which the Church would be built [Matt. 16:18] with the power of loosing and binding in heaven and on earth [Matt. 16:19]?" (Demurrer Against the Heretics 22 [A.D. 200]).    "[T]he Lord said to Peter, On this rock I will build my Church, I have given you the keys of the kingdom of heaven [and] whatever you shall have bound or loosed on earth will be bound or loosed in heaven [Matt. 16:1819]. . . . What kind of man are you, subverting and changing what was the manifest intent of the Lord when he conferred this personally upon Peter? Upon you, he says, I will build my Church; and I will give to you the keys" (Modesty 21:910 [A.D. 220]).

In 3:9 God is telling John to write to the church in Philadelphia and say certain things to them.  they also had taken up false Gods and worship of them.  God dictates this by calling the "synagogue of satan"  Remember in that time and that land the Synagogue was about the only place of worship with exception of the church of rome (catholics)  God showed John 7 different churches in 7 different places that were into worship of false gods. God's dictates to John were the same at the end of writings to each of the 7 churches. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."  Note Spirit is with a capitol "S" that means it is Gods Spirit.  If it were mans spirit or Johns it would be spelt with a small"s".

See Rev. 17:1-18.|`|M7rdNZgVaa	The word synagogue is based on the Greek word sunagoge (assembly or church). The synagogue of Satan is an assembly or church comprised of people who say they are Jews, and are not. In this context, the usage of the term Jews is in a spiritual connotation. As the apostle Paul stated, in Romans 2:29, he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter    Therefore, it is not our racial heritage that matters, but rather our spiritual standing, as Galatians 3:27-29 shows: For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you be Christs, then are you Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise. Upon conversion, true Christians become spiritual Jews. In John 4:22, Christ stated, Salvation is of the Jews.    Those who are part of the synagogue of Satan claim to be spiritual Jews. In other words, they pose as true Christians. The development of this false church was already well underway in the Apostle Johns time. Passing itself off as Gods true Church, it had congregations in the Asia Minor cities of Smyrna and Philadelphia, even then. Revelation 17 further describes it and the churches that spawned from it.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	does 'jews for jesus' ring a bell?

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.

AA10830892	Sadly to say, there is only one answer as to why protestants do not accept the teachings of Christ in regards to the Holy Eucharist.  Protestantism was founded on self-determined truth.  I read the Bible as I see fit, and interpret it according to MY way of seeing things.  Protestantism is, sadly to say (and I mean this in no derogatory way against any protestants), a religion of picking and choosing.  They are free to pick and choose their beliefs, so long as they can find one Bible verse that justifies it (even if that verse need be taken out of context).    The difference with Catholics is that Catholics read the Sacred Scriptures as a whole, in its entirety, and in the fullness of Divine Revelation.  That prevents Catholics from falsely interpreting Scripture, for they have the 2000-year-old wisdom of Sacred Tradition behind them.    Ultimately, the rejection of the Real Presence comes down to the protestant notion of authority.  Each Christian is one's own authority, because of the Holy Spirit that indwells within everyone.  What this fails to take into account, however, is the fact that the Holy Spirit cannot contradict himself;  and yet, the thousands of protestant churches do.  How is this possible if each one is "inspired"?    The Catholic notion of authority, however, is that it rests on the Divine Word.  Christ said, "This IS my Body; this IS my Blood", and therefore it is true.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	I don't believe anything the catholic church teach because it goes agains the bible.  You are blinded by your own self righteousness and you need to seek the truth.  The bible doesn't teach us to literally eat Christ.  The whole point of communion is to honor his sacrifice for mankind.  Let go of what you have been taught and believe and let the truth present itself to you.  And the truth shall set you free!|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Why is that literal, but the part about "if your eye offend thee, pluck it out" is figurative?

At the original last supper, he had a disclaimer saying they are symbolic.  Never once did He say they were his actual blood and body.|`|AA11008046	Jesus was speaking figuratively. He is the Spiritual food and the Spiritual drink.  Jesus is the "bread of life" and if you go a bit further in the chapter to verse 58 (but read all the way down to get the full picture) you will see the Jesus finishes His teaching by telling them "..this is the bread which comes down form Heaven.."  Jesus taught earlier in this lesson "..I am the bread of life..He who comes to me will never hunger.." He is teaching about Spiritual food for your soul.  He further said "..this is not the bread your fathers ate referring to the manna in the wilderness.  So Jesus Himself has made the comparison of the two types of food and also states that those who "come to Him" shall have eternal life.  Come to Him not literally eat Him.  It does little good to pick Scripture and try to verify a theory with only one or two verses.  You usually have to research the background and find out what was being taught and why.  Now for "real presence of Christ in the Euchaist"  Never happened.  You see the disciples knew what Jesus was talking about; but some who followed (Babes in Christ) were not learned enough to understand and they left (walked away)  Jesus the turned to the 12 and ask them if they also would leave?  But they did not.  Why?  the had heard Jesus teach enough that they knew His spritiual reference and understood it.  In Christianity today; people come to a church sit a listen, but because they are unlearned in the things of God they leave and do not return. why>  the spiritual teaching are over their heads and they do not follow Christ long enough for them to get the concept straight in their own minds.  Communion is symbolic of eating of Jesus body that was broken for our sin and the wine is symbolic of the blood he shed for the forgiveness of your sins and mine. If it meant we had to literally eat and drink from jesus body then we would be in trouble.  He is in Heaven preparing a place for us and the real body and blood is no longer with us sohow could we follow scripture?  We couldn't!|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Not worth my time to point out the errors of those who turn there eyes away from the truth.

Just as CJ the same as call's Jesus and the Apostles liars and not meaning what they said how do you expect to get them to see the truth.He denies Baptism and the Eucharist and there are others who agree with him and i noticed it has one theme and that is because Catholics Teach that.Hate does indeed blind or like the saying goes he bit of his nose to spite his face.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus was clearly speaking figuratively. He is the Bread of life. Jesus called Himself a door in John 10. Do you take that LITERALLY as well? Jesus is literally a door with a doorknob and hinges?     Then Jesus said to gouge your eyeballs out. Have you LITERALLY done that yet? (I hope you haven't..... I can send you for counseling if you are considering doing so)|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Good question.    CJ says that Christ was speaking only metaphorically by comparing verses like John 10:9 ("I am the door") and John 15:1 ("I am the true vine"). The problem is that there is not a connection to John 6:35, "I am the bread of life." "I am the door" and "I am the vine" make sense as metaphors because Christ is like a doorwe go to heaven through himand he is also like a vinewe get our spiritual sap through him. But Christ takes John 6:35 far beyond symbolism by saying, "For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed" (John 6:55).     He continues: "As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me" (John 6:57). The Greek word used for "eats" (trogon) is very blunt and has the sense of "chewing" or "gnawing." This is not the language of metaphor.     In John 6:63 "flesh profits nothing" refers to mankinds inclination to think using only what their natural human reason would tell them rather than what God would tell them. Thus in John 8:1516 Jesus tells his opponents: "You judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone that judge, but I and he who sent me." So natural human judgment, unaided by Gods grace, is unreliable; but Gods judgment is always true.     And were the disciples to understand the line "The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life" as nothing but a circumlocution (and a very clumsy one at that) for "symbolic"? No one can come up with such interpretations unless he first holds to the Fundamentalist position and thinks it necessary to find a rationale, no matter how forced, for evading the Catholic interpretation. In John 6:63 "flesh" does not refer to Christs own fleshthe context makes this clearbut to mankinds inclination to think on a natural, human level. "The words I have spoken to you are spirit" does not mean "What I have just said is symbolic." The word "spirit" is never used that way in the Bible. The line means that what Christ has said will be understood only through faith; only by the power of the Spirit and the drawing of the Father (cf. John 6:37, 4445, 65).     Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?" (1 Cor. 10:16). So when we receive Communion, we actually participate in the body and blood of Christ, not just eat symbols of them. Paul also said, "Therefore whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. . . . For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself" (1 Cor. 11:27, 29). "To answer for the body and blood" of someone meant to be guilty of a crime as serious as homicide. How could eating mere bread and wine "unworthily" be so serious? Pauls comment makes sense only if the bread and wine became the real body and blood of Christ.     Ignatius of Antioch, who had been a disciple of the apostle John and who wrote a letter to the Smyrnaeans about A.D. 110, said, referring to "those who hold heterodox opinions," that "they abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, flesh which suffered for our sins and which the Father, in his goodness, raised up again" (6:2, 7:1).     Forty years later, Justin Martyr, wrote, "Not as common bread or common drink do we receive these; but since Jesus Christ our Savior was made incarnate by the word of God and had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so too, as we have been taught, the food which has been made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him, and by the change of which our blood and flesh is nourished, . . . is both the flesh and the blood of that incarnated Jesus" (First Apology 66:120).     Origen, in a homily written about A.D. 244, attested to belief in the Real Presence. "I wish to admonish you with examples from your religion. You are accustomed to take part in the divine mysteries, so you know how, when you have received the Body of the Lord, you reverently exercise every care lest a particle of it fall and lest anything of the consecrated gift perish. You account yourselves guilty, and rightly do you so believe, if any of it be lost through negligence" (Homilies on Exodus 13:3).     Cyril of Jerusalem, in a catechetical lecture presented in the mid-300s, said, "Do not, therefore, regard the bread and wine as simply that, for they are, according to the Masters declaration, the body and blood of Christ. Even though the senses suggest to you the other, let faith make you firm. Do not judge in this matter by taste, but be fully assured by faith, not doubting that you have been deemed worthy   of the body and blood of Christ" (Catechetical Discourses: Mystagogic 4:22:9).     In a fifth-century homily, Theodore of Mopsuestia seemed to be speaking to todays Evangelicals and Fundamentalists: "When [Christ] gave the bread he did not say, This is the symbol of my body, but, This is my body. In the same way, when he gave the cup of his blood he did not say, This is the symbol of my blood, but, This is my blood, for he wanted us to look upon the [Eucharistic elements], after their reception of grace and the coming of the Holy Spirit, not according to their nature, but to receive them as they are, the body and blood of our Lord" (Catechetical Homilies 5:1).     Whatever else might be said, the early Church took John 6 literally. In fact, there is no record from the early centuries that implies Christians doubted the constant Catholic interpretation. There exists no document in which the literal interpretation is opposed and only the metaphorical accepted. |`|xWi4ua0Iaa	The rejection of the Eucharist is simply a logical step in the path towards atheism...across the entire expanse of the time of the Middle Ages, people accepted the Eucharist as true and authentic - every ancestor of the white European race accepted the Eucharist as the Body and Blood of the Savior.  He described Himself as "the Lamb of God" - equating His role with that of the paschal lamb used in the sacrificial system of the Jewish authorities of the time.  As the priests then ate of the lamb, so too were all Christians now to be on the same equal level with the priests and partake of Jesus as the new lamb - the new sacrifice.  The means of transubstatiation (or at least the consubstatiation of Lutherans and Episcopalians) are the only means of achieving this, and even then only in the hearts of the believers...if a Christian has become so of-the-world that they feel it is a superstitious bit of medieval nonsense, you can't expect them to accept it - to do so would be intellectually dishonest - exactly why an atheist will reject the claims of theists...hence, it is a logical step towards atheism to reject the Eucharist.    EDIT:  Why so many thumbs down?  Is the truth so hard to face?|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Faith in Christ and a public profession thereof is all that's necessary for salvation. All other stuff is symbolic, inspiring, and optional.    Religion is mostly a way for old men to exercise control, especially over women.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	I am going to paste two points from a paper regarding this issue and then put the link to the paper at the bottom. The author does a better job of answering your question than I can.    Fourth - the supper was instituted before Jesus' crucifixion  The Mass is supposed to be a re-sacrifice of Christ.  Therefore, the body and blood represented in the Mass become the broken body and shed blood of Christ.  In other words, they represent the crucifixion ordeal.  But how can this be since Jesus instituted the Supper before He was crucified?  Are we to conclude that at the Last Supper, when they were all at the table, that when Jesus broke the bread it became His actual sacrificial body -- even though the sacrifice had not yet happened?  Likewise are we to conclude that when Jesus gave the wine that it became His actual sacrificial blood -- even though the sacrifice had not yet happened?  That would make no sense at all.     Seventh - the Lord's Supper is not a sacrifice of Christ  The Bible tells us:    "By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 11 And every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified, (Heb. 10:10-14).   In the Roman Catholic Mass, there is a sacrifice of Christ.  In other words, in the ceremonies, is a reenactment and an actual sacrifice of Christ per the Mass.  This is an obvious contradiction to the Scriptures which teach us that Christ died once for all and that by the one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.  It does not state in the Word of God that the sacrifice of Christ must be repeated in order to forgive us of our sins or somehow help us to maintain our salvation by the infusion of grace.  The fact that Christ died once and the sacrifice occurred once, is proof that it is sufficient to cleanse us of our sins.  We connect with the sacrifice of Christ by faith, not by a ceremony.

I was raised protestant and we believe both the bread and wine are symbolic of His flesh and blood.  When He broke the bread with His disciples He said, "This is my body broken for you...eat it in remembrance of me."  He also said this about the cup of wine at the Last Supper.       It is a matter of doctrine.  Either way (real or symbolic), taking communion renews one's covenant with Christ until He comes again.  The important thing is that the person receiving Communion understands and believes in the sacrament of Communion.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	One exception CJ Jesus said Truly truly I say to you... cant be figutivly buddy boy      In John, chapter 6, Jesus had not only called the 12 Apostles, there was also much larger group of other disciples. Things seemed to be going pretty well. That is until Jesus said For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. This was too much for many of his disciples and From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. Jesus turns to the 12 and asks, Will ye also go away? Simon Peter gives the same answer that I find myself saying to those who tell me I should leave the Catholic Church for this reason or that one, Lord, to whom shall we go? No matter what a certain priest does, no matter what scandals hit the church, despite whatever corruption or abuse of power might exist, and despite whatever mistakes the Church has made throughout history, to whom shall we go? for here is the body and blood of Christ given for a sinner as miserable as I.       Matt. 26:26-28; Mark. 14:22,24; Luke 22;19-20; 1 Cor. 11:24-25 - Jesus says, this IS my body and blood. Jesus does not say, this is a symbol of my body and blood.    Matt. 26:26; Mark. 14:22; Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is "Touto estin to soma mou." This phraseology means "this is actually" or "this is really" my body and blood.     You do the math. If that's not enough...see:        John 6:4,11-14 - on the eve of the Passover, Jesus performs the miracle of multiplying the loaves. This was prophesied in the Old Testament (e.g., 2 Kings4:43), and foreshadows the infinite heavenly bread which is Him.    Matt. 14:19, 15:36; Mark 6:41, 8:6; Luke 9:16 - these passages are additional accounts of the multiplication miracles. This points to the Eucharist.     Matt. 16:12 - in this verse, Jesus explains His metaphorical use of the term "bread." In John 6, He eliminates any metaphorical possibilities.     John 6:4 - Jesus is in Capernaum on the eve of Passover, and the lambs are gathered to be slaughtered and eaten. Look what He says.     John 6:35,41,48,51 - Jesus says four times "I AM the bread from heaven." It is He, Himself, the eternal bread from heaven.     John 6:27,31,49 - there is a parallel between the manna in the desert which was physically consumed, and this "new" bread which must be consumed.     John 6:51-52- then Jesus says that the bread He is referring to is His flesh. The Jews take Him literally and immediately question such a teaching. How can this man give us His flesh to eat?     John 6:53 - 58 - Jesus does not correct their literal interpretation. Instead, Jesus eliminates any metaphorical interpretations by swearing an oath and being even more literal about eating His flesh. In fact, Jesus says four times we must eat His flesh and drink His blood. Catholics thus believe that Jesus makes present His body and blood in the sacrifice of the Mass. Protestants, if they are not going to become Catholic, can only argue that Jesus was somehow speaking symbolically.     John 6:23-53 - however, a symbolic interpretation is not plausible. Throughout these verses, the Greek text uses the word "phago" nine times. "Phago" literally means "to eat" or "physically consume." Like the Protestants of our day, the disciples take issue with Jesus' literal usage of "eat." So Jesus does what?     John 6:54, 56, 57, 58 - He uses an even more literal verb, translated as "trogo," which means to gnaw or chew or crunch. He increases the literalness and drives his message home. Jesus will literally give us His flesh and blood to eat. The word trogo is only used two other times in the New Testament (in Matt. 24:38 and John 13:18) and it always means to literally gnaw or chew meat. While phago might also have a spiritual application, "trogo" is never used metaphorically in Greek. So Protestants cannot find one verse in Scripture where "trogo" is used symbolically, and yet this must be their argument if they are going to deny the Catholic understanding of Jesus' words. Moreover, the Jews already knew Jesus was speaking literally even before Jesus used the word trogo when they said How can this man give us His flesh to eat? (John 6:52).     John 6:55 - to clarify further, Jesus says "For My Flesh is food indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed." This phrase can only be understood as being responsive to those who do not believe that Jesus' flesh is food indeed, and His blood is drink indeed. Further, Jesus uses the word which is translated as "sarx." "Sarx" means flesh (not "soma" which means body). See, for example, John 1:13,14; 3:6; 8:15; 17:2; Matt. 16:17; 19:5; 24:22; 26:41; Mark 10:8; 13:20; 14:38; and Luke 3:6; 24:39 which provides other examples in Scripture where "sarx" means flesh. It is always literal.     John 6:55 - further, the phrases "real" food and "real" drink use the word "alethes." "Alethes" means "really" or "truly," and would only be used if there were doubts concerning the reality of Jesus' flesh and blood as being food and drink. Thus, Jesus is emphasizing the miracle of His body and blood being actual food and drink.     John 6:60 - as are many anti-Catholics today, Jesus' disciples are scandalized by these words. They even ask, "Who can 'listen' to it (much less understand it)?" To the unillumined mind, it seems grotesque.     John 6:61-63 - Jesus acknowledges their disgust. Jesus' use of the phrase "the spirit gives life" means the disciples need supernatural faith, not logic, to understand His words.     John 3:6 - Jesus often used the comparison of "spirit versus flesh" to teach about the necessity of possessing supernatural faith versus a natural understanding. In Mark 14:38 Jesus also uses the "spirit/flesh" comparison. The spirit|`|PWankIUpaa	Because I believe IN Christ Jesus Himself!

Isn't that where the wafer becomes Christ's flesh?      ...yeah, I don't believe in that.  I'm not trying to be offensive to those who do, but it doesn't make sense to me.  Viewing the bread or whatever as a SYMBOLIC part of Christ's flesh is okay, because Christ is obviously pretty big on symbolism and that would fit in with His teachings.  I do not, however, think Christ would bother to make the wafer actual flesh, because what would be the point?  Most of the Christian teachings seem to concern the way we treat others or the way we view the world and our Savior, and it doesn't make sense that Christ would keep altering the bread just so we can physically take Him into ourselves when what's important is the way we accept Him emotionally and spiritually.      And ignoring the implications of cannibalism, because I'm positive that's not the way we're meant to look at this even if the cynic in me can't help it, the Eucharist is not in the Bible.  There isn't a single verse saying that bread should ever be Christ's actual flesh.  When Christ instigated the sacrament, He was saying we should take the break and wine in MEMORY of His broken flesh and shed blood.  He never said it would actually become part of Him!  I'd be curious to see which verses you think support the Eucharist, but I've never found any myself.  And I have looked.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	I have never understood or felt deeply the Eucharist ritual. It has always been just a communal sharing. This was good enough for me but not the big deal that some made out of it.    As for the Bible, I ditched that later in life but still long ago.The Bible was written by men immersed in an ancient patriarchal culture. No matter how inspired the authors were or by what source, the information had to filter through their minds and personalities. They all had agendas, whether it was keeping the social order, unifying doctrine, eliminating heresy or gaining converts. For me, it's a pretty transparent piece of propaganda.    What I do value in the Bible is the story of Christ's life and teachings. I think He knew how misinterpreted and manipulated words can become and therefore lived in a way that would allow us to follow in His footsteps regardless of what anyone wrote about Him.    The links below objectively detail the origins of the Bible (1)  as well as the inconsistencies and inaccuracies (2)|`|aPuj6xoHaa	Christ is really present in my life right now.  When I became a born again believer I became indwelt with the Holy Spirit, thus Christ is present in my life.    But to answer you question:  -----------  Luke 22:19 [MacArthur Study Bible Commentary, NASB]:  "This is My body."  i.e, it represented His body.  Such metaphorical language was a typical Hebraism.  No eucharistic miracle of transubstantiation was implied, nor could the disciples have missed the symbolic intent of His statement, for His actual body-yet unbroken- was before their very eyes.  -----------|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Jesus could not possibly have meant that the bread and juice would actually become His body and blood.   When He instituted the Supper, He was there in His physical body, "so the piece of wafer which He said was His body, and the cup of wine which He said was His blood, could not possibly have been His body and His blood in any literal sense; certainly, He was indicating that these were symbols that He was using".       Paul plainly says the Lord's Supper is a symbolic, memorial meal (1 Co. 11:23-25).      In Jn. 6 Jesus explained the meaning of His demand that men eat His flesh and drink His blood, and He said it had a symbolic, not a literal meaning (Jn. 6:35,38,41,48,53).      The sacrifice of Christ was a once-for-all event (He. 9:12,26,28; 10:10,12,14). When Christ died on the Cross, He said, "It is finished" (Jn. 19:30). The RCC, with its repeated sacrifices of Christ, denies the eternal sufficiency of Christ's Atonement.   A sacrifice without blood cannot atone for sins (Le. 17:11; He. 9:22).   The intrusion of a special priesthood between Christ and the believer is an unbiblical abomination (1 Ti. 2:5; He. 7:24-27; 1 Pe. 2:5,9).   Masses for the dead, which are central in Catholic practice, are entirely foreign to the Bible. Prayers and rituals for the dead are pagan practices, not biblical Christianity (De. 18:9,11; 26:13-14).   The supposed changes which occur in the Mass are clearly deceptions. The bread and wine remain unchanged in appearance, color, odor, or form, yet the Catholic Church requires its people to believe the elements actually become Christ. They call this deception a miracle, but true biblical miracles are real and observable.   It is idolatry to worship the elements of the Mass (Ex. 20:4-5; Jn. 4:24).   There is no semblance between the drama of the Catholic Mass and the simple ceremony initiated by Christ and practiced by the N.T. churches (Mt. 26:26-29; Mk. 14:23-25; Lk. 22:19-20; 1 Co. 11:23-25). It is obvious that the Lord Jesus Christ did not institute the Mass. The Bible promises perfect security and assurance through Christ's once-for-all sacrifice on Calvary. Any person who places his trust entirely in Christ and His shed blood need never doubt his eternal salvation before God (Jn. 3:16; He. 9:12). The Lord's Supper, far from repeating Christ's sacrifice, simply REMINDS the believer of that glorious sacrifice by which he is redeemed unto God forever!|`|349974840c2ddf946cda1b9160ff2645aa	What it comes down to is that you can choose to believe or not believe, it is all a question of faith. Sick people have bee healed believing that it's the medicine (sometimes it's just sugar water) but it is their faith that heals them.

They thought it was nonsense and they left Him.    The Protestants and fundamentalists, have left the Church that Jesus Christ founded and they cannot accept the doctrine of transubstantiation as taught by the Apostles and believed by Christians even before the Bible was compiled.  They are no longer part of Jesus' Church and so they think it is nonsense.    I believe in what the Apostles taught and what the real Christians have believed since the first century...that Jesus was really present in the Eucharist.|`|0A7xLrz2aa	It all boils down to one's interpretation of John 6.  The Catholics (and Orthodox) say that it should be taken literally and so they believe in the real presence of Jesus in communion.  The Protestants say it is just symbolic.    Who should I believe?    Since the Catholic Church compiled and canonized the Bible then I will have to agree with the Catholic interpretation.    Since Catholics wrote (under God's inspiration) the books of the New Testament including the Gospel of John, then I will have to agree with the Catholic interpretation.    Since the Bible tells us that the Church is the pillar and foundation of truth, then the Catholic interpretation must be correct.    Since the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ, it has the guidance of the Holy Spirit, then I am sure that the Church will not err in its interpretation of the Bible.    Since the Protestants and fundies are separated from the Church founded by Jesus, they are not guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore prone to errors when interpreting Scripture.    I will have to agree with the interpretation of the Catholic Church on John 6 and reject the erroneous interpretation of the Protestants and fundies.

Abiding in Christ (John 1:1-7) is the key.|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings.....This state is a higher state of awareness which bisects the past and the future. Usually human beings are most of the time unable to enter the present because the mind is either thinking about the future (Ego) or the past (Superego). Interestingly, we are only in a present when we watch something in admiration, or enjoy some action to its full measure (like a child).    In the state of thoughtless awareness we are free to think about whatever we want but we dont have unwanted thoughts in our mind at all, we have complete control over our mind. Our mind becomes very relaxed yet completely focused on any tasks we need to perform in our daily lives.|`|8w0LGwC9aa	Yes it is possible,it is quite possible.|`|AA11894640	I don't think it is!

Grace and works are OPPOSITES (Romans 11:6).  If a person adds any works, then it fails to be grace.     All of the Lord's blessings are given by grace, and never by works.  Nobody can "earn" a blessing from the Lord.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	CONDESCENSION OF GOD, ELECTION OF GRACE, GOD, LOVE, MERCY, SALVATION BY GRACE. God's grace consists in his love, mercy, and condescension toward his children. All things that exist are manifestations of the grace of God. The creation of the earth, life itself, the atonement of Christ, the plan of salvation, kingdoms of immortal glory hereafter, and the supreme gift of eternal life - all these things come by the grace of him whose we are.       Grace is granted to men proportionately as they conform to the standards of personal righteousness that are part of the gospel plan. Thus the saints are commanded to "grow in grace", until they are sanctified and justified, "though the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."  Grace is an attribute of perfection possessed by Deity , and Christ himself "received grace for grace" until finally he gained the fulness of the Father. The same path to perfection is offered to man. "If you keep my commandments," the Lord says, "you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace."|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Grace is nothing if we don't have Faith.

Rom. 4:16.    Without the grace of Christ, the sinner is in a hopeless condition; nothing can be done for him; but through divine grace, supernatural power is imparted. . . . It is through the impartation of the grace of Christ that sin is discerned in its hateful nature, and finally driven from the soul temple. It is through grace that we are brought into fellowship with Christ, to be associated with Him in the work of salvation. Faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to promise pardon to sinners; not that there is any virtue in faith whereby salvation is merited, but because faith can lay hold of the merits of Christ, the remedy provided for sin.     The touch of faith opens to us the divine treasure house of power and wisdom; and thus, through instruments of clay, God accomplishes the wonders of His grace. This living faith is our great need today. We must know that Jesus is indeed ours; that His Spirit is purifying and refining our hearts. If the followers of Christ had genuine faith, with meekness and love, what a work they might accomplish! What fruit would be seen to the glory of God!|`|r8rykCkGaa	Jesus said "My grace is sufficient for you.  Your strength is made perfect in weakness."

GRACE has rightly been described as "unmerited favor," but it has been my observation that GRACE is not only unmerited, it is the OPPOSITE of what I deserve.  I deserve eternal death.  I have eternal life.  I deserve to be punished forever.  I am being blessed with blessing upon blessing.  My natural tendency is to sin more and more, but by His GRACE I am being conformed to the image of Christ and being transformed from glory to glory. (But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2Cor. 3:18)    One of my favorite verses speaks of the GRACE of our Lord Jesus Christ. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.(2 Corinthians 8:9)    God reveals to us His grace. We need to learn more and more about it, and then to experience it at work in our lives. The acrostic, "God's Riches At Christ's Expense," catches some of its majesty. Grace is God freely providing for us (as we trust in the work of His Son) all that we will ever need, all that we will ever yearn for, all that He has commanded us to walk in and become, realities that we could never produce on our own, could never earn, and could never deserve. Grace offers what every human desperately needs, but what God alone can provide.  No human can be fulfilled apart from the revelation of Gods GRACE and His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.    This grace is found only in a person, the Lord Jesus. It is the "grace of our Lord Jesus Christ." Thus, it is accessible only through an ongoing personal relationship with Him.  Paul yearned to know Him more intimately.  I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: (and Paul goes on to show that he mirrors the same grace in his own life) for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	grace is like pixie dust, only less real|`|mFGyonmTaa	Grace Coolidge Biography  U.S. First Lady  Name at birth: Grace Anna Goodhue    Grace Coolidge was married to United States president Calvin Coolidge and presided as First Lady from 1923 until 1929. Grace was a graduate of the University of Vermont (1902) and taught at the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts before she married Calvin (1905). While Calvin was lawyering in Northampton and then politicking in Boston, she was hostess and mother to their two sons. When Calvin became Warren G. Harding's vice president, Grace moved into Washington society, and when he became president after Harding's death in 1923, Grace became First Lady. Uninvolved in politics, she worked on behalf of the hearing-impaired and executed her duties as the first lady with a lively personality that stood in contrast to her famously taciturn husband, "Silent Cal." She was known as good-natured and charming, despite the tragedy of their youngest son's death in 1924.

Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by the works    All Christians believe in the role of baptism in the life of the Christian. The differences which exist are differences of emphasis--of the necessity of baptism--and not of the call to be baptized. Roman Catholic Christians believe that in the sacrament of baptism the individual is both   regenerated through water and the Holy Spirit and   truly incorporated into the Church of Jesus Christ.   Jn 3:5   Jesus answered (Nicodemus), "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."   Mt 28:19   Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit,   Mt 3:11   I am baptizing you with water, for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is mightier than I. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire.   Gal 3:25-27   But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a disciplinarian. For through faith you are all children of God in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.   1 Cor 12:12-13   As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so also Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free persons, and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.   Acts 2:37-38 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and they asked Peter and the other apostles, "What are we to do, my brothers?" Peter (said) to them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the holy Spirit."   Acts 10:44-47   While Peter was still speaking these things, the holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word. The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured out on the Gentiles also, for they could hear them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter responded, "Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we have?"   Acts 8:11-13   They paid attention to him (Simon Magus) because he had astounded them by his magic for a long time, but once they began to believe Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, men and women alike were baptized. Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptized, became devoted to Philip.   Titus 3:5   ... not because of any righteous deeds we had done but because of his mercy, he saved us through the bath of rebirth (baptism) and renewal by the holy Spirit.   1 Pet 3:20-21   God patiently waited in the days of Noah during the building of the ark, in which a few persons, eight in all, were saved through water. This prefigured baptism, which saves you now.   Rom 6:3-4   Or are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.   Col 2:12   You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.   The teaching authority of the Church, the Magisterium, has clearly stated the role of baptism in the life of the Christian.   Lateran Council IV, 1215   Infallibly defined that baptism was a sacrament of the Church.   Council of Lyons II, 1274   Infallibly redefined that baptism was one of the seven sacraments.   Council of Trent, 1545 - 1563   Again infallibly defined the seven sacraments listing baptism as the opening gateway and foundation of the sacraments.|`|qodXWYPuaa	grace means attainment  beyond yr reach.and we attain grace through prayerful meditation, or meditational prayers.for that u may try self awareness meditation, which is based on grace bestowing power of god called guru.luv, sw. maa

You're a nurse, so you understand there is a lot of emotional problems that can be associated with a person who has a physical disfigurement or abnormality, whether it be something congenital or acquired. Correcting these problems with plastic surgery can greatly improve a person's quality in life by allowing them to have normalcy which allows them to function in society and feel better about themself.    I guess, Islamically, I would say it comes to intention and reason for having it done.

There is evidence in the Sunnah to indicate that they are permissible and that the one who does them does not intend to change the creation of Allaah.     (i)  It was narrated from Arfajah ibn Asad that he lost his nose in the battle of al-Kulaab during the Jaahiliyyah, so he wore a nose made of silver but it became putrid, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to wear a nose made of gold. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1770; Abu Dawood, 4232; al-Nasaai, 5161. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwa al-Ghaleel, 824.    (ii) It was narrated that Abd-Allaah ibn Masood said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursing those women who pluck their eyebrows and file their teeth for the purpose of beautification and change the creation of Allaah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim.   ______________________________________...     2  The second type of cosmetic surgery is that which is done for the purpose of beautification.     These are operations that are done to improve the appearance in the eye of the beholder, such as making the nose look more beautiful by making it smaller, or making the breasts look more beautiful by making them smaller or larger, or facelifts, and so on.     This kind of surgery is not for any necessary reason, rather the purpose is to change the creation of Allaah and tinker with it according to peoples whims and desires. So this is haraam and it is not permissible to do it, because it is changing the creation of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     They (all those who worship others than Allaah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allaah), and they invoke nothing but Shaytaan (Satan), a persistent rebel!    118. Allaah cursed him. And he [Shaytaan (Satan)] said: I will take an appointed portion of your slaves.    119. Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah    [al-Nisa 4:117-119]     The Shaytaan is the one who tells people to change the creation of Allaah.     [See: Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah by Shaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti.]     Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:     What is the ruling on cosmetic surgery? What is the ruling on learning the science of beautification?     He replied:     Cosmetic procedures are of two types:     1  Those which are done to remove a fault resulting from an accident etc. There is nothing wrong with that because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave permission to a man whose nose had been cut off in battle to wear a nose made of gold.     2  Those which are unnecessary and are not done to remove a fault but rather to increase beauty. This is haraam and is not permissible, because the Messenger of Allaah (S) cursed women who pluck eyebrows, those who have their eyebrows plucked, those who fix hair extensions, those who have hair extensions done, those who do tattoos and those  who have tattoos done, because that is done as an enhancement and is not done to remove faults.     With regard to the medical student who learns about cosmetic surgery during the course of his studies, there is nothing wrong with him learning that, but he should not do that in haraam cases, rather he should advise those who ask for that to avoid it because it is haraam. Perhaps if this advice comes from the lips of a doctor it will have more effect on a person.     [ Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/412.]    ____________________________________    If the  purpose of the cosmetic surgery is to remove the defect, then there is nothing wrong with that.     But if the purpose is simply to make it more beautiful then it is not permissible to do this surgery.   ______________________________________...|`|q0GKDfF0aa	Quote:  Islam denounces excess in beautifying oneself to the extent of altering one's physical features as Allah created them. The Qur'an considers such alterations as inspired by Satan, who  ...will command them (his devotees) to change what Allah has created... (An-Nisa: 119)     Dealing with the question in point, the eminent Muslim scholar, Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, states:     Surgeries for beautification are in vogue today as the result of the materialistic pattern of Western civilization, whose main focus is the body and its desires. Men and women spend hundreds and thousands of dollars to reshape their noses or breasts, or whatever they consider defective. This behavior most certainly belongs to the category of excessive beautification, unnecessarily changing what Allah has created, and it makes one subject to the curse of Allah and His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Likewise, it involves torture, pain, and waste of money merely for the sake of one's appearance, in addition to its being an expression of an individual's preoccupation with form rather than substance, with body rather than soul.     It may happen that a person has an unusual physical defect, which attracts the attention of others to the point of inflicting on him physical and psychological pain every time he meets people. In this case, he may treat the defect and thus alleviate the embarrassment that makes his life miserable. Allah, the Most Merciful, has imposed no hardship on us in religion.... (Al-Bahi Al-Khuli, Al-Mar'ah bayna Al-Bayt wal-Mujtama`, 2nd edition, p. 105.)     This statement may be supported by the Hadith concerning widening the gap between the teeth for the sake of beautification, for what is disapproved here is doing this merely for the sake of artificial beauty. However, if it is needed to eliminate pain or distress, there is nothing wrong in doing it."     In this context, the eminent Muslim scholar, Dr. `Abdel-Fattah Idrees, Professor of Comparative Jurisprudence at Al-Azhar Univ., states:     "There is nothing wrong with plastic surgery if it is used to treat a deformed organ where the operation will offer a better quality of life. However, such surgery is not permissible if it is used for the mere purpose of beautification and altering the creation of Allah.     The previous view does not in any way dissuade a person from showing interest in his outward appearance and beauty. Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to have an interest in his appearance and adornment. And he also urged his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) to follow suit."     Shedding more light on this issue Sheikh `Atiyyah Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, states the following:     "Beautification which is used to reshape a deformed part of the body is generally recommended in Islam, as long as it is used for a valid reason.     As far as plastic surgery in Islam is concerned, we can say that there are two main kinds of plastic surgery, and they are as follows:     The first kind of plastic surgery is used for medical treatment, mainly to alleviate the suffering of the person. For example, there is nothing wrong with the use of plastic surgery in skin grafting, suturing a hollow wound and bone-setting. This kind of beautification is permissible. It is a form of co-operation in what is good and preventing harm that a person may face due to a deformity in his physical and outward appearance.     The second kind is cosmetic surgery that is normally used to change the Creation of Allah in an attempt to look more beautiful such as breast enlargement or reduction, face-lifts, spacing between teeth (just for beautification), reducing the size of lips and nose. This kind of surgery is not permitted in Islam because they alter the Creation of Allah. Allah Almighty says: "And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires in them, and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle's ears, and surely I will command them and they will change Allah's creation. Whoso chooseth Satan for a patron instead of Allah is verily a loser and his loss is manifest." (An-Nisaa': 119)     Plastic surgery has advanced at a rapid rate in an attempt to reduce people's suffering. Unfortunately, some forms of surgery are used for luxurious purposes and not for a sound reason. Islam, however, welcomes the use of plastic surgery as long as it is done in people's favor. In certain cases, it is a necessity to remove an unwanted tooth or finger that might appear in a person's body.|`|R3W6szSUaa	hey , as long as you are doing it for your husband its okey or you are only doing it for your self its okey,but its not okey if you want to go show it off to the world......|`|lar1FyQBaa	heaven forbid!  ha ha don't you know this all haram in islam lol

If it is permitted, who is permitted to do that for her?    Praise be to Allaah.    -It is permitted for a woman to remove all her body hair, except for her eyebrows and the hair on her head, which she is not permitted to shave or remove by other methods. She may remove other hair herself, or her husband or other mahram may remove it within the limits of what he is permitted to see, or another woman may do this, within the limits of what she is permitted to see.    [ Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa'imah, 5/194]  ______________________________________    What is the Islamic ruling concerning the removal of women's facial fair specifically, the upper lip, if the hair is very visible or obvious? Is it permissible to remove it, or is does it come under the category of plucking? What about hair on the legs and arms?    Praise be to Allaah.    -There is nothing wrong with a woman removing hair from her upper lip, thighs, legs and arms. This is not included in the category of plucking which is forbidden.    [ Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa'imah, 5/194]  __________________________________    What about the permanent removal of hairs anywhere else on the body?    - There is nothing wrong with it.    There is nothing wrong with using any method of removing the hair which we are commanded to remove (such as pubic hair and armpit hair) or the hair which we are permitted to remove (such as hair on the arms or legs), so long as the method used is not harmful  even if it means that the hair will not grow back again.  ________________________________|`|VVk0hHgpaa	It's not allowed in Islam but again I see each to their own and I don't see any wrong in if someone wants to remove hair.

AA11047076	There are a few opinions on this:   Rashi: Ur- is fire thus "Ur Chasdim:  would be the fire of the Chaldeans.  He bases this interpretation on a  Midrash in Bereishis Rabbah  Menachem Ben Saruk: Ur is a valley or deep fissure based on the usage of Ur found in certain verses in Yishayahu (Isaiah)  Ramban:  Ur Kasdim is "Fire of the Chaldeans"- referring to the miracle that is discussed in Midrashim about Abraham being thrown into a furnace thus "Ur Kasdim" refers to the fire of the furnace in this miracle.    efit: None of the commentaries give any meaning to the name beyond indicating that it belonged to the Chaldeans (who are equated to the Babylonians).  If you wanted to be creative you could probably break it down to :K'shadim. "like shadim" (i.e. like demons) but I have never seen anything like that n any of the coomentaries- it seems that they generally just see it named after the region and don't discuss its entymology.  I'll take a look at some of the other meforshim over the weekend and see if anyone comments on it.

vhlORK4Waa	Hi    1. Aether is another word for Spirit; not something different. I can recommend some books if you want to learn more.    2. Earth, Air, Fire and Water are the other 'elements' - different modern pagan paths and reconstructionists may use other attributions, such as ice in the North.    3. What man within a star? Are you thinking of Da Vinci's Vitruvian man? It doesn't have anything to do with the  five wounds of Christ "thing".    4. I think others have already covered off the fact that the Star of David has six points (two triangles, one inverted over the other)    5. The pentagram as used by modern day neo-pagans that follow the Wiccan path represents many things, but you ought to be aware that the inverted pentagram is NOT a symbol of "evil" as the poster cooky states below. The pentagram is, amongst other things, a symbol of the union of the elements and Spirit not only on an earthly plane, but in one's soul. The downward pentgram's bad rep is actually mainly in the USA, and mainly thanks to Hollywood, and people that confuse the Christian heresy of satanism, with any pagan path. Cooky please take note.    6. As people have said on here, we are all human, we all have the human experience, and all faiths find that if something works, borrow it!     7. Poster Cooky - if you properly understood the symbolism in the pentagram you would not accuse (incorrectly as it happens) of Freemasons of using the inverted pentagram - they don't......the pentagram is part of the Royal Arch ... I am not a mason, but I do iknow that much.    So to sum up  - the pentgram is a symbol used by different religious groups over time, and no doubt will be used by others in the future. All part of the human condition, all inter-related.|`|AA11297267	Or it could simply be that ancient mystics borrowed symbols from each other that they thought were "cool," and gave them their own meaning...  The christians are notorious for taking the practices, symbols, and doctrine of existing groups and incorporating them into their own mysticism, sometimes keeping them intact and sometimes changing much of the meaning.  Like christmas :)    It probably indicates the connectivity of humans more than anything else.  Without any evidence of anything "supernatural," there's no reason to suppose there's any greater meaning than that.    Peace.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	pentagram is Not the star of David....

The inverted pentagram, with the point of the star is downward, is used to conjure up the powers of evil. As the circle is believed to enhance the powers of a particular symbol it is usually added to the pentagram. The ordinary (point-up) pentagram is the symbol of witches, warlocks and Wiccans in general and which they call "The Great Rite", whereas the inverted (point-down) pentagram is the symbol of Satanism.  The point-down pentacle is also the symbol of Masonry and the Eastern Star.    Did you know that the ram and the goat are synonymous with witchcraft and Satan worship?  The Baphomet or Satanic pentagram is pointed downward to accommodate the outline of a goat's head.    Some witches today claim that the goat head is really supposed to be a ram's head (which originated with the ram-headed god of Ammon in ancient times).  The photo to the right is Ammon, the Egyptian ram-god, also identified with the Greek god Zeus.  A ram (a non-castrated adult male sheep), has CURVED horns (as in the center photo above); whereas, as goat has a beard and STRAIGHT horns (as in the left photo above).  BOTH symbols are utilized in today's Satanism, occult, and witchcraft circles.  The Church of Satan uses the goat's head on their main webpage.  The pentagram image is inherent to BOTH the goat and the ram.  Whether ram or goat, BOTH animals are used to depict the works of darkness.      Notice below on Ozzy Osborne's album cover that he uses the RAM (curved horns).  Do you really think it a coincidence the Paul McCartney placed a RAM on his album cover?  Clearly, the music industry has an infatuation with Satanic symbolism.     On Ozzy's cover, the fans are all TOUCHING (caressing) the beast, just as McCartney is fondling the RAM on his album cover.  Of course, the goat and ram represent Satan.  Such affection is symbolic of one's fondness and allegiance to Satan.  It is to no surprise that the Rolling Stones produced a blasphemous song titled "Sympathy for the Devil".  Satan has successfully slithered his way into the hearts of America's youth through evil music.    Satanism and sexual rituals have always been inseparable.  In Greek mythology, the goat is considered an agent of fertility...                      http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20R...|`|gqhoCu3faa	THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.

Look what is going on in The Congo right now.    Why? Women until recent history were considered nothing more than property. All women. We belonged to our fathers and then to our husbands. In many parts of the world that is still true. When you view someone as less than you it is easier to victimize them.    As for America and other Western countries, our society has gotten so sex obsessed, with porn and casual sex seen as normal. Too many males think of nothing but sex and how to get it any more.

It is sick and until we women start fighting back, we will remain the punching bags of scum...    The Biblical view of women  http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...  The God of the Bible decrees that woman must submit to the dominance of man.    "The social and legal position of an Israelite wife was inferior to the position a wife occupied in the great countries round about... all the texts show that Israelites wanted mainly sons to perpetuate the family line and fortune, and to preserve the ancestral inheritance... A husband could divorce his wife; women on the other hand could not ask for divorce... the wife called her husband Ba'al or master; she also called him adon or lord; she addressed him, in fact, as a slave addressed his master or subject, his king. The Decalogue includes a man's wife among his possessions... all her life she remains a minor. The wife does not inherit from her husband, nor daughters from their father, except when there is no male heir. A vow made by a girl or married woman needs, to be valid, the consent of the father or husband and if this consent is withheld, the vow is null and void. A man had a right to sell his daughter. Women were excluded from the succession."    -Roland de Vaux, archaeologist and priest  --------------------------------------...  Female Inferiority  "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God." (I Corinthians 11:3)    "For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man." (I Corinthians 11:8-9)    Comment  The Bible's decree of male supremacy has kept woman inferior to men for centuries. For the religious, it comes as a sad fact that a human must have a penis to receive any respect or power within the Church.    All woman should realize that such phrases in the Bible has justified for many Christian men, not only their supremacy but a reason to sexually abuse women.    (See also I Cor. 14:34-36, I Timothy 2:8-15, I Peter 3:1-7, Ephesians 5:22-24, Col. 3:18-19)  --------------------------------------...  Rape My Daughter  "Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go." (Judges 19:24-25)    Comment  Judges 19 describe a father who offers his virgin daughter to a drunken mob. When the father says "unto this man do not so vile a thing," he makes clear that sexual abuse should never befall a man (meaning him), yet a woman, even his own flesh and blood, or a concubine belonging to a perfect stranger, can receive punishment from men to do what they wish. This attitude against women still persists to this day and we have the Bible, in large part, to thank for this attitude against women.    Verse 25 describes the hours long gang rape of the poor concubine. The Bible gives not one hint of passion or concern for the raped girl. Considering that many people believe that every word in the Bible comes from God, it should not surprise anyone why people still use these verses to justify such atrocities.  --------------------------------------...  Silence The Woman!  "Let the women learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression." (I Timothy 2:11-14)    Comment  Another case where the Bible makes it quite clear that women live for man and must submit to them.    "Man enjoys the great advantage of having a god endorse the code he writes; and since man exercises a sovereign authority over women it is especially fortunate that this authority has been vested in him by the Supreme Being. For the Jews, Mohammedans and Christians among others, man is master by divine right; the fear of God will therefore repress any impulse towards revolt in the do|`|cxip3nA8aa	I live in the US, but I'm not a victim.

One reason American's may be raped in cases where the women may have been able to prevent it is during dating or being around men too much alone.    For instance, a lot of women go on a first or second date then brilliantly decide to go into the guy's shes dating home to "watch a movie".  Things get heated up, and he ends up not resisting the temptation.    I don't argue that this is still rape and the man's fault, but women should be more intelligent than to go in a man's home or even car unless she knows him well. Intelligent women can prevent many of such situations by knowing a man GOOD before being alone with him!      I do want to say also that America is very strict on rape.  If a man rapes a woman and it is proven, then he will have a prison sentence of at least 4 years.   That is a long time, if you wanna compare it with some other countries (such as india) where a man can bribe his way out of jail within a day!|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Because some people take what they want.

Afterall, consider His rather blatant rage and violent actions in the OT.  Not exactly a shining example of restraint let alone love.

God doesn't create it, you create it. God doesn't send you there, you send yourself there. Heaven is enlightenment and being spiritually close to the divine presence in the universe. If you make the right choices, life is good. If you make the wrong choices you elect to push yourself away from all that is good and you are just torturing yourself and living in a hell of your own creation.|`|AA11294818	Hell is separation between man and God if man doesn't want God in his life.

Maybe ppl in hell don't even exist at that point without God.  We aren't really like clueless children running in the street, though. I know what you are saying, but we are thinking beings who have the abilities required to have a relationship with God... and giving an equipped being the gift freedom is a loving thing.|`|CLloj0DZaa	Its not hateful, God created a place away from His presence b/c of sin.

God is so holy and perfect that He is extremely sensitive to sin(anything we do that doesn't obey God). Hell was meant for Satan and his angels, but when sin entered into our lives, we were considered a Satan follower. But God loved us so much that He gave us a solution out of that problem: Jesus Christ. "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." John 3:16  Jesus died on the cross for our sins. And when you believe on him you will have everlasting life(you won't go to hell). just pray for forgiveness of your sins and recognize that you are a sinner and that Christ died on the cross for our sins.|`|M7rdNZgVaa	He gave you freedom of choice.

However, by denying Hell, the unbeliever is giving the lie to One of infinite dignity, pride, and glory, Who is sublimely and infinitely powerful, and is accusing Him of impotence, lying, and powerlessness; he is insulting His dignity and offending His pride terribly. He is rebelliously causing affront to His glory. If, to suppose the impossible, there was no reason for Hells existence, it would certainly be created for unbelief, which comprises denial and ascribing impotence to this degree, and such an unbeliever would certainly be cast into it.|`|HvpEZrpvaa	Its like we are in a test..People who work hard and honest deserve to go to heaven BUT people who don't work hard..laires..cheaters..DONT DESERVE TO GO TO HEAVEN..they should go to hell!!

AA11989999	That is a telling and compelling line of logic. Standard religions , Christendom included, forbid certain activities and thoughts, and prescribe certain virtuous doings and thinkings. But no one tells anyone HOW to conform to saintliness. How can an angry person change to a peaceful one? How does a lust-driven person calm the hot waves of desire? How does an envious person stop wanting what the Joneses have? How can someone love God and love his neighbor, if he has not love to begin with?    But if an inner transformation has occurred, there is a cleansing, and a change of nature. The addict turns clean. The chronic masturbater becomes a normal partner in a loving relationship, or celibate if convenient. One becomes content with what he has, and can afford, and does not resent others for their better luck.     This is the Kingdom Jesus spoke of, where ABUNDANCE is the rule, rather than scarcity.

If a slave is set free from it's prior owner, and the prior owner comes along and demands that he get back to work, the slave has the right to say "NO!", but nothing can stop him from actually obeying his former master.    Paul said it like this, "Don't you know that you are a slave to whatever power you choose to obey?"  (it goes on from there).    Once a person has been "purchased with a price", they rightfully belong to Jesus.    But that doesn't take away our free will.    The difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is that the non-Christian is still a slave, and MUST obey sin.    We sin when we are drawn away by the lusts of our own flesh ("the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, and the pride of life.").  But "whom the Son sets free, shall be free indeed", so he or she is no longer obligated to obey sin - Christians who sin are like a toddler trying to walk - they may keep falling down, but if they keep getting up again, one day they will no longer fall (unless they slip on some ice on the sidewalk after a freezing rain or snow), but then they get back up again.  I have NEVER heard of ANY one EVER staying on their knees the rest of their lives, unless they have some kind of physical handicap.  And then, they use either crutches or a wheel chair.    Sometimes I think I'm crippled (spiritually speaking), so if Jesus is a crutch, I need both of them to survive!

John says when you sin repent and the blood of Jesus will cleanse you.    Jesus, the prophets, his disciples and apostles all said he shed his blood for our sins.    As long as we walk in the Spirit we will not sin.    1Jn 1:5  This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.   1Jn 1:6  If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:   1Jn 1:7  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.   1Jn 1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.   1Jn 1:9  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.   1Jn 1:10  If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.    Rom 8:3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:   Rom 8:4  That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Everything else is merely commentary.

There is a immense power in journalism , to shine the light on issues and not allow them to be swept under the rug. I applaud that. The flip side is it can be used (intentionally or not) as a way of sensationalizing the bad and actually exacerbating a situation. It's a fine line. I think the best approach in this film would have been exactly what he did, but add in some balance. Most cops are good & just. Many die in the line of duty protecting us.

A lot of what Micheal Moore talks about has some truth but he only picks out the small bad stuff out of so many good people.  There is a way you need to act when around police officers that pull you over or enter your house. And that is don't make stupid movements when they are telling you to put your hands up.   If a cop has his gun pulled on you, don't you think it would be a good idea to obey his commands? You see what he doesn't mention is they command them to put their hands up for a reason, so they should just do it. When cops arrive on seen many times its for violent criminals with guns. So next time you see a cop and he tells you FREEZE DON"T MOVE ITS THE POLICE!!! don't go to your pockets.

p5cglKf0aa	THIRD EVIDENCE: Here we will point out from the New Testament (NT) and the Old Testament (OT) a few examples of verses concerning our Prophet (ASW).     FIRST:In the Psalms, there is this verse 'O Allah, send to us after the period between prophets one who will establish an exemplary model.' Here "one who will establish an exemplary model" refers to the Prophet Muhammad (ASW).     A verse from the NT says: "The Messiah said, 'I am leaving for my and your Father so that He may send you the Paraclete," that is, Ahmad Muhammad.     A second verse from the NT: "I ask from my Lord for the Paraclete that he may abide with you forever." Paraclete, meaning "the separator of good from evil," is the name of our Prophet (ASW) as mentioned in those books.     A verse from the OT says: "Verily Allah told Abraham that Hagar -the mother of Isma'il- will bear children. There will emerge from her sons one whose hand will be above all, and the hands of all will be opened to him in reverence."     Another verse from the OT: "And He said to Moses, "O Moses, verily I shall send them a Prophet like you, from the sons of their brothers (the children of Isma'il (AS)); I shall place My Word in his mouth, and shall punish whoever does not accept the words of the one who will speak in My Name."     A third verse from the OT: "Moses said, 'O Lord! Verily I have found in the Book the best of Ummahs that will emerge for the benefit of humanity, that will enjoin the good and forbid the wrong, and that will believe in Allah. Let it be my Ummah!' Allah said, 'That is the Ummah of Muhammad.' "     [A REMlNDER: In those books, the name Muhammad is given in Syriac form, such as Mushaffah, Munhamanna, Himyata which all mean Muhammad in Hebrew. Otherwise the name Muhammad is explicitly mentioned only in a few places, which were also altered by envious Jews.]     From among the Seven Abdullahs, Abdullah b. Amr b. As, who made extensive studies of the earlier scriptures, Abdullah b. Salam, who was the earliest to accept Islam from among the famous Jewish scholars, and the famous scholar Ka'b al-Ahbar from among the Children of Israel all pointed in the Torah, which was not then corrupted to its present extent, the following verse, which, after addressing Moses (AS), then addresses the Prophet yet-to-come: "O Prophet, verily We have sent you as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings, a warner and a protection for the unlettered. You are My bondsman, and I have named you 'the reliant on Allah.' You will not be harsh, stem and clamorous in the marketplaces, nor will you requite evil with evil, but instead pardon and forgive. Allah shall not take you unto Himself until you straightenest a crooked people by causing them to say, 'No god but Allah.' " Another verse from the OT:     "Muhammad is Allah's Messenger, his birthplace is Mecca, he will emigrate to Tayba, his rule will be in Damascus, and his Ummah will be constantly engaged in praise."     In this verse, a Syriac word meaning Muhammad is actually mentioned for the word Muhammad. Here is another verse from the OT:     "You are My bondsman and messenger, and I have named you 'reliant on Allah,' " addressed to a Prophet who is to come after Moses (AS), and is from the progeny of Isma'il, the brothers of Isaac (AS).     In the following verse from the OT,   "My chosen bondsman is not harsh or stem, " the meaning of Mukhtar (chosen) is the same as "Mustafa," another name of Muhammad (ASW).     In several places in the four books of NT, a Prophet who will come after Jesus (AS) is referred to as "the master of the world." Describing him, the Bible says,"With him is an iron staff with which he will fight,as will his people."     http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&...|`|q0GKDfF0aa	According to the Prophet, peace be upon him, the Quran is sufficient for Muslims.    The Quran contains the important and relevant parts of the previous Holy Books. Besides, we are not sure which parts of the existing versions of these books are authentic and which are not. Many non-Muslim Biblical scholars cast doubts about many parts of the Bible today. So it is safest not to take them as authentic books.    Peace-salaam|`|4jglFl19aa	I'm a Muslim, but once i've read some of the pages of the Bible.  Not in the religious sense, although.|`|6nWGMP5Laa	we muslim believe in all prophets of Allah and the book revealed to them and this is part of article of faith.    well, i tried to find Injeel(gospel) but i couldnt find any injeel revealed to jesus christ pbuh  there were lots of gospels like gospel of mattew,  gospel of mark,  gospel of luke..............  where is gospel of jesus?    Dr. W Graham Scroggie of the Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, a prestigious Christian evangelical mission, says:    "..Yes, the Bible is human, although some out of zeal which is not according to knowledge, have denied this. Those books have passed through the minds of men, are written in the language of men, were penned by the hands of men and bear in their style the characteristics of men...."    "It is Human, Yet Divine," W Graham Scroggie, p. 17    Another Christian scholar, Kenneth Cragg, the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, says:    "...Not so the New testament...There is condensation and editing; there is choice reproduction and witness. The Gospels have come through the mind of the church behind the authors. They represent experience and history..."     r. Lobegott Friedrich Konstantin Von Tischendorf, one of the most adamant conservative Christian defenders of the Trinity was himself driven to admit that:    "[the New Testament had] in many passages undergone such serious modification of meaning as to leave us in painful uncertainty as to what the Apostles had actually written"     Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth says:    "As the brethren desired me to write epistles(letters), I did so, and these the apostles of the devil have filled with tares (undesirable elements), exchanging some things and adding others, for whom there is a woe reserved. It is not therefore, a matter of wonder if some have also attempted to adulterate the sacred writings of the Lord, since they have attempted the same in other works that are not to be compared with these."    The Qur'an confirms this with the words:    "Then woe to those who write the book (of Allah/God) with their own hands and then say: 'This is from Allah', to traffic with it for a miserable price. Woe to them for what their hands do write and for the gain they make thereby"    The noble Qur'an Al-Baqarah(2):79|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	They were only mean't for their time n they are not present in their original forms today.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	They are contradictory to the Quran.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	I dont have to, they were all abrogated,,|`|0NXdjyo2aa	The Qur'an contains all the original messages that were once included before they were altered.

It's easier to be mean than nice isn't it? For some people things like this just come naturally.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Well..many who make poor decisions and then face the consequences of their actions call themselves "down on their luck" because they will not accept the responsibility for their own position.  That's why those people get bashed.    So..how did you get where you are?|`|1kZenfZzaa	I have always believed that it gives people a way to feel superior to someone else.  Too bad they don't realize that a truly "BIG" person is understanding.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	Conservatives and fundamentalist Christians have been promulgating propaganda that if you are poor or you are "down on your luck" it is your fault because you are lazy.    Accordingly, many people feel the need to punish such people for there immoral act of being poor or having bad luck.    Also, it is safer for people to express their frustrations at someone of lower status and being "down on you luck" puts you in a lower status position.|`|j5y1pONfaa	Wow, my mom is like that too!!! I didn't speak to her for a long time either. She moved in with my hubby and me without asking. Because she was my mom I didn't stop it. BUT she was so negative that I told my other 3 sisters they can deal with her if they want because I was done. It got to a point where she was making me depressed and I was crying all the time in secret, so my hubby told me she had to leave. She moved in with my other sisters and the exact same thing happened to them.     She is now on medicine for being bi-polar and if she takes her meds then she is tolerable. I can now go over to see her and not dread it. I feel for you I really really do!!    I think the reason people do that is because they want attention or want to see others miserable too. Its sad really.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	She wants you to get off your *** and do something about it, but perhaps has a hard time being nice about it.|`|2FNfyxVqaa	I truly believe its because they are insecure with themselves so it makes them feel good to see you down and when you're down they want to keep you there. I actually pity these people because they are sad. If you feel the need to make someone else feel bad or rub it in their face, then you're no good of a person yourself and i can only imagine that they may be jealous of you, even if it's your own mother.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	An overabundance of schadenfreude. Annoying as hell, just ignore it.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	because at some point the person down on luck is going to have to let that thought process go! and move on!   or that down on luck will never go away!|`|rThIVk2maa	You could sigh wearily and say "yes yes, whatever you say, now if you don't mind I do have to go."|`|dCewrtXaaa	Your mom feels guilty because she thinks that your being down on your luck is her fault. To make it less her fault, she tries to pretend that she taught you everything you needed to know, but that you didn't learn. In reality, whatever was not learned was never really taught, since teach and learn are reciprocal verbs.
aUScPZFYaa	I think he was a victim of his ignorant times. Some people were going along just to get along.( I also read somewhere that Lincoln had some Black or Native American in him) Just like Thomas Jefferson who had a Black mistress who he was in loved with and George Washington who was a slave owner but was said to be anti-slavery. Back than if a White person was to express even the slightest sympathy for Blacks they would be called a N-word lover, which was equal to be a N-word.     Lincoln's hat is awesome. That was the style back than in the mid-1800s.     Lincoln was 6'4/ 6'5 The tallest U.S. president.    I never heard of a Black person having a picture of Lincoln. The only people who revere him are Republicans. They consider him to be the father of the Republican Party.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	White people got Washington, Nixon, and Don Imus on their walls?|`|qZF4r71taa	Yes, all of my black friends have shrines made where they worship the 'mighty Lincoln god'.  They even burn incense in his name.|`|K0mvCFhEaa	Heck No!!    Where did you hear that?    In my area we all know that Abe was a racist and that the only reason he signed the emancipation proclamation was because the country was splitting up over the slavery issue.    And I've never heard of any Black people hanging pictures of JFK or Lincoln on their walls.    Thats a downright lie.    Most "Blacks" hang up pictures of Martin Luther King, "Jesus," and their family members.|`|69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	I have never known any black person to hang either man's picture but I am sure it happened back in the day, my parents had Huey Newton hanging on the wall...|`|DmjSkZSTaa	nah the only white people on any of my families walls are the ppl from the godfather movie..and thats only because my grandfather is Sicilian..  Lincoln was A FRIGGAN racists. He did what was best for the U.S, not slaves lol. what freed slaves were the war.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	I've never known a black person who hung either JFK or Abe Lincoln's portrait on their wall. Jesus, sure (heck, I've got a picture of the Sacred Heart on my wall), but not those two. And no one I know really "reveres" him. Most of us who've studied history understand that he didn't free the slaves to be magnanimous or generous and that it was more of a political move. I'm sure Lincoln was just a product of his times. It was pretty common for whites to make racial slurs back then.|`|0hsh000waa	Were you watching V103 this morning?   I swear Tom Joyner ( or some other guy on the show) said this.    Abe was a racist in the beginning of his life but because of meeting Fredrick Douglas, his ideal changed. He thought that black men should have the right to vote that's when I was killed because people were threatened because that would make blacks citizens.    Prior to meeting Fredrick, he enjoyed black-face shows used the n-word made blackie jokes etc.. Also after the slaves were freed he planned to shipped them off to Panama.
YYbVDcw8aa	Pardon my ignorance, Why are people hunting wolves? if it's to eat  well that's one thing but is there commercial Wolf hunting in Alaska? Is there captured or caged hunting practices going on? are the Wolves treated cruelly. Wow! If everyone hunted and killed their own food there would be a whole lot of vegetarians, and much of this self-righteous nonsense would stop. However I would never hunt or eat a Wolf for personal reasons. Are the Alaskan people defending Caribou herds?  Wow! just looked it up. People get like that about White Tail Deer hunting in PA.  For some ridiculous reason it is apparently preferable to hit them with your car than hunt them and eat them, go figure. We really are just about over run with them and they taste good.|`|qZF4r71taa	Personally, I think Ashley Judd is a babe, I love her movies, and she looked great naked in one of her films.  Her personal life is something I don't care to  investigate.
SNVauR3laa	I think that there are visual cues as to when to check on a table. Glasses getting empty, patrons looking around for you, making weird faces at their food like it isn't prepared properly. It is also bad form to ask anything while they are in deep conversation. If you don't want to seem like you are ignoring them, but when they come in, they look like a group that will gab over dinner, you may let them know that you will be watching for a cue to come over, then just try to make eye contact with someone at the table periodically. Maybe even a gesture such as a thumbs up to them would let them let you know if they need anything from you.     That being said, you will never make everyone happy. If you have only had one sarcastic remark in two years, then you probably have a very good handle on your job. There are just people out there who do not show others the respect and consideration that they deserve.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	I think you are paranoid.|`|ds5MCdS5aa	I was a server for a number of years, and one thing was very clear to me:  No matter how good you are, there will always be people who find fault with your service.  When I went back to check on tables after the food was out, i would say something like, "just want to make sure everything is how you wanted it" or "everything is to your liking".  It sends a clear signal that you are NOT rushing, just making sure the food is good, and that they are enjoying it.  Good Luck!|`|TPVvddHWaa	You are being over sensitive, she obviously wanted to draw attention to herself and feels superior when she can put some one else down. You were in no position to argue with her so she knew she was safe making you the victim of her bullying. Sad lady. I have seen this sort of behaviour, always people from a certain country an ocean away from mine.    You may want to consider if you are giving off body language that may indicate you are hurrying people along. If this sort of thing happens a lot.     Watch how others handle the same thing we never stop learning.    May be you are ready for a career change.|`|aa4de9b3ec59bb8460ddd7367ffa1afcaa	I think you're probably worrying needlessly.  Ultimately, customers know that they are the ones who hold the cards; after all, they're the ones holding the money.   Given that, you're more likely to be accused of unsatisfactory service by NOT being available when needed than of being TOO available.     That said, hovering isn't exactly preferable either.  Go for the natural excuses to pause and ask how everyone's doing.  Obviously the most natural way to check up without seeming to rush them is to come offering to bring more to drink when a guest's glass gets low.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I feel out the situation. Most of the time I just see if everything is ok and they are not bothered, but if someone's deep in conversation or looks like they don't want to be bothered, I just walk by the table to make my presence known. That way if they need me they can speak up but if they don't, no problem

It is just who they are.|`|AA12158476	That is sort of generalizing. I know quite a few lesbians who do take pride in their appearance. Those who don't, or may not take as much time, to me are quite comfortable with who they are. What makes them feel any less than woman just because they don't wear make-up, do their hair or look feminine? They are who they are by their standards, not by society.|`|aaQUMXUzaa	I believe more do than you expect, the dyke looking ones are the one's that stand out and are noticeable. I am a long time friend of a lesbian couple and they are gorgeous.|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Ouch. I suggest you meet more lesbians, then. There are also plenty of straight women who fit your description of no make-up, hair, etc. Besides, if that's how they're comfortable then so be it. Why so judgmental? Differences keep things interesting, anyway.

It says that "By grace are ye saved, not by works."  Grace means the unmerited favour of God.  Unmerited means that we do not deserve it but, even though we do not deserve God's love and life in Heaven with Him, He gives it to those who accept His Son.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the good works we have done (or not done) throughout our lives.    Which verses do you refer to  to make you say what you have said above?      The bible also says that "Faith without works is dead." BUT the faith comes FIRST and THEN we desire to do the works for God, not so that He will accept us, because He already has done that.
FZKFLTyLaa	Do you go or know anyone who goes to longfellow middle school in wauwatosa?  No, I do not..
AA11114869	Almost anyone with any years behind them has pondered their mortality, and it's been my experience that most will audaciously claim that they are NOT afraid of death. I feel the vast majority of them are being more than just a little disingenuous with that claim...    ...Everyone will die...  So,..., given that fact, why do most people find, to varying degrees, the idea of their eventual demise, - disturbing?    I feel much the same way you do in that the fear lies not so much in 'death' itself but, rather,... just when and/or how one will go about 'dying'?    Many will say that they "Don't fear The Reaper"...  ...and, who knows, --- maybe they don't.    But deep down inside, whether they will admit it or not, - is the fear of His 'Scythe'...,  ... for no one ever knows how sharp or dull the blade on that Scythe will be when Death comes to reap their soul with it.  -|`|uavC9WsEaa	no, it happens so theres no use worrying about it. its pointless to fear death.|`|pUIsx4Vsaa	There is nothing to be afraid of except fear itself.

Because when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, you are guaranteed to be going to heaven and not to be sent to hell.     The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.     So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|PGRacfmdaa	Yes it terrifies me more than anything else    It's just the fact that you don't exist anymore and that everyone else carries on without you - and it's forever.

If its slow & painful then yeah, i'm worried.

How doesn't that scare you?  :)  x|`|AA10096992	Not afraid, per se, but I have a strong aversion to not existing anymore.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	I prefer to live, and I do fear death..  If I were to be placed in a scenario where I were about to die I would be scared and seek a means of survival.    I don't understand how anyone could not be afraid of death.  It is our end, we cease to exist and there is nothing.  Sure, when we are dead we will not experience fear but that is later in the time frame when we do not experience anything.. As a living thinking being, I do fear the inevitable death.  The very thought of ceasing to exist does not sit well with me.|`|1757d3a103d979c710a9780f556edb22aa	Death is nothing to fear; it is the next step on our path of eternal progression.  We can't reach our destination and become like our Heavenly Father without death.|`|KVBTtF9faa	I do not fear death. I'm more afraid of how my children react when I die. I don't want to leave Earth before they have all reached adulthood and have their own families. I hate the idea of leaving them while they are young and need me. And as a mother, I think the worst thing any parent can experience is the death of a child. I fear that.     But actually, I think "the other side" will be far more pleasant. Plus I know my animal companions from this life will be waiting for me and I look forward to seeing them again! :)|`|oAMDkwtHaa	Well i think when you die ummm errrrrr this may sound wereid but thats it ur gone people will remember u but you can not come back to life people who say this sometimes mean for example if u were cremated turned to ashes ur ashes would help plants grow and if u were burried bugs will eat u helping them to grow - thats my opinion some people think you come back as a ghost or spirt in some relidgions u have started of and a fish or something and if you live a good life you and when u die u will become somthing bigger and stronger sorta like a food chain.......  AND no i am not afraid of death|`|qItxNgMeaa	I'm a Christian but I'm still scared. I'm worried about whether it will hurt and how long the pain will last, if it does hurt. -_-  I imagine if I die in my sleep I'll get kind of a shock. "I don't remember putting pearly gates in my bedroom..."|`|PnfMLfNPaa	No. I think death is just the Beginning.|`|ibtDTUEuaa	I'm not afraid of death, I just hope it's painless and quick.  I used to be afraid of death, because I didn't want to go to hell, however I was also afraid of living - a purposeless and hopeless life... I wanted my life to mean something....be worthwhile.  Once I discovered the purpose of life, and that there was hope I was no longer afraid of death.|`|PRbtcAHOaa	no, im afraid for the people and the life im going to leave behind
oGVvEl3Maa	"How does one go about fully surrendering to the will of God?"    i would be most interested in their replies... and if they were true Spiritual leaders... they would have a spiritual answer to my question that would remove all my difficulties... (insha'Allah).    in the meantime... i rely on the wisdom of Mullah Nasrudin (may he always be prosperous...) and the word of God.    His Venerable and Outrageous Holiness Mulla Nasruddin, originally Nasr ud din, has returned to modern life with a thing or two on his mind. One of those things is the proper spelling of his name. Nasreddin, Nasrudin, Nazrudin, and Nazrudeen are all popular. The most honored Mullah indicates that all spellings are acceptable when they are on invitations to dinner.

(1) how can I do that when I don't know what if feels like unless I have experienced it?  (2) It was hard for me to feel spiritual when I was living around a lot of noise & negative people. I saved money & got out of that atmosphere. I focused on my spiritual life but neglected my finances. How can I get a balance here?  (3) I know all the things to do so that I can create my perfect reality. How come i am not able to do this though? I used to alteast do this when I wanted something a lot but now it seems I am losing what is so important to me. Why is all I know not working for me?  (4) With all the work, all the reading I have done to learn spiritual truth why am I suffering from almost the same amount of problems I had 30 yesrs ago?

5RH9Osdsaa	Wow, lots of people said they never wished they weren't gay.  I wish I had that kind of confidence.    When I first realized I was gay, I would have given anything to have been different.  I told myself it was just a phase and it would pass, but it didn't.  Then I became angry at God, because I believed God hated me and I was certain that my friends and family would hate me if they knew the truth.  At that point, I became suicidal and definitely would have given anything to change.    Fortunately, I have come through that phase of my life.  I am out to my friends and family and increasingly to my community as a whole.  I am happy to be who I am and I wouldn't change that for anything.  Its strange how things seem to come full circle.    But, in answer to your question, yes I did wish I wasn't gay and I think that is fairly common.|`|o248uonEaa	Yeah actually!|`|jnG8sOzWaa	thank God i'm not....i'm normal|`|QWMPWia4aa	NO WAY!

If you are attracted to both guys and girls you are probably bisexual.  If you are attracted only to girls, you are a lesbian, regardless of previously dating guys.    I wouldn't get too hung up on the labels, though.  Trust your instincts and feelings.  Be happy with who you are and who you are with.

Be cautious and in time, you'll know what you are.|`|I8dGnXaFaa	You don't say how old your are now but since you say you "hook up" with a lot of guys I assume you enjoy relations with males and have been at it for awhile.  So, in pencil, check off "likes guys".  The next part sounds like my story--likes a woman's body but shy.  The fact that you haven't "scored" with another girl, tried but froze up, but enjoy lesbian porn tells me you want to have a lesbian experience, been close,  but are afraid of taking the big step.  When you do, if you are with the right girl, it will be the greatest experience of your life and I strongly suspect you may want to erase the "likes guys" check mark.  I suspect your fear is that you will confirm what you already feel and know.  You may want to watch the movie "Gray Matters".  Good luck--go take the next step.

It is to be expected that different witnesses will have different accounts of what happened in any situation. In fact, modern US trial lawyers are allowed to bring in a expert on witness testimony to inform the jury on just how shaky this form of evidence is. Your question makes me want to take another look at the New Testament to see if all of the gospel writers were even there, because I seem to recall that some of them were doing something else, but I may just be confused on this point.|`|AA11212224	Note that in Matthew, the author says that Jesus cried out "again with a loud voice" and then died.  It's possible that what He cried out was "Father into thy hands I commend my spirit" and/or "It is finished", and the witnesses that Matthew relied upon (he wasn't at the crucifixion himself) simply couldn't understand the words.    Of the four gospel writers, only John was present at the crucifixion.  The other three writers depended upon eyewitnesses, who were in different positions and would have heard something different.  Not only that, but John was right in front.  He would have heard Jesus' last words clearer than witnesses standing at a distance (which is what the other three writers depended on).    My point is, Jesus said all of it.  John was aware of the other three gospels, so he only added his unique perspective.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Those aren't his last words - you forget the part of the story where he came back from the dead.    Mark 16:15-18 " He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."|`|etA9BX5gaa	gotcha!|`|ueP6VXevaa	A farewel speech consists of all the words you use to say farewel.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	aaagggghhhhhhhhh|`|S2slIAWCaa	My God, someone please get me a nail puller.

Edit @ The Cricket - You need to stop lying to yourself. The gospel of John was written between 80-90 years AFTER JC allegedly died, which is hardly an eyewitness testament. Add to this the fact that John came AFTER the other three (Mark was the first). The gospel authors were UNKNOWN (the Catholic Church already admitted that, and that they gave the M,M,L, and J names of four of the alleged apostles to give the first published New Testament CREDIBILITY). Did you know when this first NT was published? In the LATE 3RD CENTURY. Jesus didn't exist - no Biblical scholar, try as he might, has ever found any evidence for the historical Jesus. But as Psychology 101 will teach you, a lie often repeated eventually becomes truth.|`|DyORD0Zkaa	check the holy Quran and you will figure out this answer|`|sV4knlUfaa	Yeah its amazing isn't it. All the contradictions and still the religious make up some explanation about it instead of saying "you know what, I think you may have something there, I think I'll investigate that and make up my own mind instead of being told the way it is"  A good book for that sort of stuff is "The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail", last third of the book comes up with all sorts of great stuff like that.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	All those words that you quote were said whilst Jesus was on the cross, dying.

Kwfo0aRvaa	Steve Hassan, founder of Freedom of Mind and an expert in cults and other toxic organizations, makes these recommendations:    1.  Who is the leader?    What are his/her background and qualifications?    Have you relied solely on trust that all of the information you were given is true or have you done independent investigation?    Do you feel pressure to accept and not question at all?    Is it possible that there are misrepresentations or falsehoods?    Is there external corroboration for extraordinary claims of accomplishment or are they simply his/her say-so?    If "miracles" have been performed, can they be replicated under open observation or even under scientific conditions?    Are there other explanations for the "miracles," such as magic tricks, hypnosis, etc.?    If there is a former leader or member, have you sought him or her out to hear for yourself critical information? If not, are you afraid to trust your ability to discern the truthfulness of what you learn?    If you find yourself saying that you don't care if there are major deceptions, ask yourself if you knew this information before you became involved, would you have even bothered to make a commitment of time and money?     2.  Are there exclusive claims made to wisdom, knowledge, love, and truth? If so, the burden of proof is on the leader to demonstrate his or her superiority, not on members to disprove it. A truly "developed" spiritual being exudes love, compassion, and humility. Any person who claims to be "superior" but does not practice what they preach is of questionable character. There is never incongruency between words and deeds. A person who uses fear and phobia indoctrination to control followers demonstrates insecurity and lack of spiritual maturity.     3.  Is total submission and obedience required? Any relationship that demands giving up one's personal integrity and conscience is dangerous and leads to totalitarianism. Be wary of those who advocate "the ends justify the means," especially when it clearly serves their own self-interest. Also, make sure that your desire "to believe" doesn't simply activate the common psychological defense mechanisms: denial, rationalization, justification, and wishful thinking. If a doctrine is true or a person is truly spiritually advanced, they will stand up to the scrutiny of objective evaluation. If they do not prove themselves, they are probably not worthy of your commitment and devotion.     4.  Does he/ she have a criminal record, a legacy of allegations against him/her or a history of misconduct? If there are allegations of misconduct against the leader, the responsible follower must seek out the negative information and the sources of that information to evaluate the truth. If a leader claims to be celibate and allegations are made that the leader engaged in inappropriate sex, this is an extreme violation of integrity. It must be investigated vigorously. It is never appropriate for teachers, therapists, or spiritual masters to take advantage of a power differential over followers. This is especially true in the area of sexuality. It is grossly unethical to engage in sexual relations with someone who has placed their trust in as a teacher/advisor/master. Many followers are incredibly vulnerable to this and unable to resist sexual intimacy. Anyone should be able to say "no."    Is he or she a "trust bandit," stealing hearts, souls, minds, bodies, and pocketbooks for his or her own ends?     5.  Does the leader demonstrate psychological problems and awareness of their existence?    Does the leader have addictions to power, drugs, alcohol, sex, even television or shopping?    Does the leader have emotional outbursts?    Does the leader physically abuse followers?    Does the leader drive expensive cars and wear expensive clothes while extolling the virtues of renunciation?    Does the leader financially exploit followers by expecting them to live in poverty while he or she indulges in luxury?    Is the group or leader's driveway habitually filled with luxury cars while ordinary people find him or her inaccessible and unreachable?    Does the leader ever encourage deception or use deception as a "technique" to trick followers into so-called correct thinking and understanding?    Codependent behavior by a spiritual teacher should be a warning sign of danger. Codependency includes: obsessively trying to control others; allowing people to hurt and use them; lack of clear boundaries; being reactive, not proactive; tunnel visioned; obsessive worrying and denial; expectations of perfection and suppression of human needs. (Beattie, Beyond Codependency, Harper/Hazelden, 1989)     6.  Are questions and doubts permitted within the organization?  A healthy spiritual environment must engage individual followers at  their level of experience and should encourage them to feel and think and therefore question their beliefs and exercise good decision-making. In this way, the follower can investigate,|`|H7L66ynJaa	They would all deny 1,2,4 and 5 and say yes to 3|`|flrOp5YLaa	It is really sad that questions like that even have to be asked.

So much sugarcoating or twisting the *church's* real history, or real "doctrines"!    Sadly, these are cult tatics. They just are.    Everyone should research all you can before ever joining a church. If you leave it up the trusting just *what* they are taught to teach you, you are going to be in for some major shocking information later.    The information that you come upon later comes far to late. I found out I would have never joined *this* church. I had never heard about this doctrine etc...Usually you are emotionally, spiritually, socially, connected to the religion. It can become your world. Especially if you are raised in the religion.     These kinds of religions have a way to feed your "soul" just the right way, and in some cases teach the US vs Them mentality.

I agree with Divider of Truth's answer and I've got to go back and spend more time reading Jao's answer.    At the end of 2004 I left the liberal denomination that I had belonged to because they had become a nice social organization that read from the Bible for appearances but did not live it out.  It made me think of someone trying to treat Type 1 Diabetes with The Cotton Candy Diet.    After doing some praying and church shopping for 4 months I found a Bible church.  It isn't about religion because that is man-made worship.  It is about Relationship with the Living LORD.    Edit:  Jao provided an excellent list to use in considering when choosing a church.

AA10052130	ALL Christians DO keep the Sabbath.  Those who claim to be Christian but do not obey God's Commandments are liars.    1 John 2:4 -- He who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.    -~~- -~~- -~~- -~~- -~~- -~~- -~~-     breyet_leyet,    There is joy in Heaven because you have turned from sin (Luke 15:7).    However, when you say, "I think I will try keeping the Sabbath," there is concern.    If you think you'll try, then you think you'll fail.    It is NOT an easy road.  But, it's either all the way, or it's no way.    The straight and difficult path, is the one that leads to eternal life (Matthew 7:14).  Everything else leads to destruction.    "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62).    When you turn to God, you burn your bridges behind you. Not that they're not going to burn anyway, but it's best not to be trying to use them when they burn.    God wants full, total and absolute commitment.  No "try", and if it gets too tough, "Oh, well.  I tried."    It's not that I'm trying to be a prophet of doom for you, but we are entering into the time of world trouble like this world has never known before.  EVERYONE'S trouble.  If you want to know that there is peace, joy and reward at the end of that trouble, you need to be fully commited to the one who has that reward to give to those who stuck by him through thick and thin.  The Kingdom and the reward is worth the troubles and trials of keeping God's commandments -- all of them.    Remember also, it is not by OUR strength that we keep God's Commandments:  2 Chronicles 15:7 -- But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded!"  2 Corinthians 12:10 -- Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.    Philippians 4:13 -- I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.    So, be strong in Christ, for your reward is great.  .|`|DiIAaFgzaa	All Christians should strive to obedient to God.  God's most basic commandments for all people are listed in the 10 Commandments.

I can go into any church and preach a serman on any of the other Ten Commandments and everyone will say Amen and God bless you brother but when I bring up the sabbath every one sees that as legalistic.       Contrary to popular belief the Sabbath was kept by Jesus deciples after he assended to heaven. For proof of this there is a web site I want you all to look at.     http://www.cogwriter.com/sabbath.htm      It was not till Constantine I decreed that Sunday (dies Solis) will be observed as the Roman day of rest [CJ3.12.2]:    On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country however persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits because it often happens that another day is not suitable for grain-sowing or vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost.     After he supposedly say a cross of light in the sky and converted to christianity. I believe his conversion was faulse and that he brought in many pegan things that we now call christian. To read more on him look at     http://www.reformation.org/meet-the-firs...      Then Sunday worship came into the church and sabbath worship was out lawed. It was not till the reformers came that people started to read for them selves and realise that there was alot of wrong in the catholic church. Alot of things that were not biblical. And started to change them.       This of course lead to the inquesision and other horrable atrosities by the catholic church. They in fact admit they changed the day and they see christians worshiping on sunday as following there power.       Simply put if the Christian comunity continues to keep sunday agenst what Gods law says they will be following mans law and not Gods. Further more They will be lending power to a church with tremendus pegan and non christian overtones. Though they will not admit it.       God bless my prayers are with you all.|`|yluVQqcRaa	IF we do not keep the Sabbath, we are not being Christian.  In Matthew 5:17-20 Rabi Jesus states that he is not here to start a new religion; but to fix the Jewish one.   And it stayed that way for 300 years!  It was not until 305/6 A.D. that 29 men did not like that they had 603 Commandments to keep, that took a lot of effort. So they made what has become the "Catholic" church.  When the printing press was invented men saw that the Catholic was not teaching what the Bible dose say; so new, obedient (for the time) religions came to be. Few, if any, are totally obeying all of the Bible today.  In Acts one will read that they met in the Synagogues, in the evenings.|`|pSCHJJ7raa	There will be people in heaven who have never kept the Sabbath. But that will be because they never heard of it.

In Ezekiel the Lord tells the watchman if he calls out the warning and the people won't listen, then their blood will be upon their own hands.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	Our Creator, the God of Israel, intended for all of His creation to oberve His Sabbaths.    In the KJV the hebrew word for "keep" is shamar, meaning to protect and guard.    Exo 31:14  Ye shall keep [shamar] the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.    Strong's 8104. shamar, shaw-mar'; a prim. root; prop. to hedge about (as with thorns), i.e. guard; gen. to protect, ...    His people are instructed to "protect" and "guard" the Sabbath, just as Adam was to protect the garden.     Gen 2:15  Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep [shamar] it.      In this world currently ruled by the adversary it will take much strength and courage to "shamar" the Sabbath of YHVH until the return of His Kingdom.    John 14:30  "I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;    Josh 1:7  "Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go.

Prohibition of Murder: You shall not murder. (Genesis 9:6)     3. Prohibition of Theft: You shall not steal.     4.

Prohibition of Blasphemy: You shall not blaspheme God's name.     6. Dietary Law: Do not eat flesh taken from an animal while it is still alive. (Genesis 9:4)     7.

The sabbath was a forced rest from works.  Likewise to be saved, we must stop doing works for salvation, and simply believe in Jesus alone without our own works.

Romans and Colossians also say not to keep any sabbath.|`|AA11220299	No, where is there a command for Christians to keep the Sabbath?|`|g4AAZRuxaa	It does not matter what day Christians set aside, the book of Romans mentions this, it even says to some all days are alike, we are not to judge.|`|AA10471892	What amazing black and white thinking, which is typical of those who are in cults.    The sabbath was the sign of the old covenant, and Christians were not a party to that covenant.  The law of God for Christians is revealed by Paul as a law of faith (Romans 3:27) and a law of the spirit leading to life as contrasted to the old covenant law of sin and death that leads to death.     You made a choice all right.  You chose condemnation and death.  You chose to be under the old covenant and a party to it, contrary to the warnings of Paul in places like Galatians 5:1    Circumcision was a direct command from God also. Do you teach circumcision?|`|dbw210qqaa	All Christians should be filled with God's Holy Spirit and follow Him|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Yes. Why you ask? Because Jesus is our Sabbath rest not a day. Jesus can be our Sabbath rest in part because He is Lord of the Sabbath (Matthew 12:8). As God incarnate, He decides the true meaning of the Sabbath because He created it, and He is our Sabbath rest in the flesh. When the Pharisees criticized Him for healing on the Sabbath, Jesus reminded them that even they, sinful as they were, would not hesitate to pull a sheep out of a pit on the Sabbath. Because He came to seek and save His sheep who would hear His voice (John 10:3,27) and enter into the Sabbath rest He provided by paying for their sins, He could break the Sabbath rules. He told the Pharisees that people are more important than sheep and the salvation He provided was more important than rules. By saying, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath (Mark 2:27), Jesus was restating the principle that the Sabbath rest was instituted to relieve man of his labors, just as He came to relieve us of our attempting to achieve salvation by our works. We no longer rest for only one day, but forever cease our laboring to attain Gods favor. Jesus is our rest from works now, just as He is the door to heaven, where we will rest in Him forever.    Hebrews 4 is the definitive passage regarding Jesus as our Sabbath rest. The writer to the Hebrews exhorts his readers to enter in to the Sabbath rest provided by Christ. After three chapters of telling them that Jesus is superior to the angels and that He is our Apostle and High Priest, he pleads with them to not harden their hearts against Him, as their fathers hardened their hearts against Jehovah in the wilderness. Because of their unbelief, God denied that generation access to the holy land, saying, They shall not enter into My rest (Hebrews 3:11). In the same way, the writer to the Hebrews begs themand usnot to make the same mistake by rejecting Gods Sabbath rest in Jesus Christ. There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience (Hebrews 4:9-11).     There is no other Sabbath rest besides Jesus. He alone satisfies the requirements of the Law, and He alone provides the sacrifice that atones for sin. He is Gods plan for us to cease from the labor of our own works. We dare not reject this one-and-only Way of salvation (John 14:6). Gods reaction to those who choose to reject His plan is seen in Numbers 15. A man was found gathering sticks on the Sabbath day, in spite of Gods plain commandment to cease from all labor on the Sabbath. This transgression was a known and willful sin, done with unblushing boldness in broad daylight, in open defiance of the divine authority. And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death (v. 35). So it will be to all who reject Gods provision for our Sabbath rest in Christ. How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? (Hebrews 2:3).    Hope this helps.    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival    *EDIT*    Jay (below). I said yes, but read why I said yes.

Well go back and read the story and see what Jesus answer was...|`|LJlaHLQdaa	YES TO YOUR QUESTION:      The Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment  Unchanged.     The commandment for Sabbath observance reads: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle; not thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."     The Sabbath commandment is placed in the very bosom of the Decalogue, amid the unchangeable precepts of Jehovah. And yet from many pulpits of our land a contemptuous cry is raised against the Sabbath instituted by the Lord God of heaven, and it is stigmatized as "the old Jewish Sabbath." Let all who are seeking for truth remember that the Sabbath was instituted in Eden before there was a Jew in existence, and that the Saviour said, "The Sabbath was made for man." The fourth commandment was spoken with the other nine of God's moral precepts, amid the thunders and grandeur of Mount Sinai, and in the holy of holies in the heavenly sanctuary above, is the ark of God. It is called the "ark of the testament," and under its cover,--the mercy seat,--are the ten commandments that were written with the finger of God.  ______________________________________...    Sunday Laws                     Satan's Challenge to God's Authority          God denounces Babylon "because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.".    God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh, sanctifying this day, and setting it apart from all others as holy to Himself, to be observed by His people throughout their generations. But the man of sin, exalting himself above God, sitting in the temple of God, and showing himself to be God, thought to change times and laws. This power, thinking to prove that it was not only equal to God, but above God, changed the rest day, placing the first day of the week where the seventh should be. And the Protestant world has taken this child of the papacy to be regarded as sacred. In the Word of God this is called her fornication [Rev. 14:8].  ______________________________________...    Sunday-Law Advocates                             Do Not Realize What They Are Doing            The Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending. . . .     They are working in blindness. They do not see that if a Protestant government sacrifices the principles that have made them a free, independent nation, and through legislation brings into the Constitution principles that will propagate papal falsehood and papal delusion, they are plunging into the Roman horrors of the Dark Ages.         There are many, even of those engaged in this movement for Sunday enforcement, who are blinded to the results which will follow this action. They do not see that they are striking directly against religious liberty. There are many who have never understood the claims of the Bible Sabbath and the false foundation upon which the Sunday institution rests.          Those who are making an effort to change the Constitution and secure a law enforcing Sunday observance little realize what will be the result. A crisis is just upon us.|`|KEwIn1lPaa	No.  Not all christians are called to completely obey the Word of God.  A majority of professing christians choose to be called the least in the Kingdom of God.  And God will not force them to do any different.  Although...    God has disciples like you and I laboring to convince those who are deceived into rejecting The Sabbath Day to please reconsider this issue, don't give up so much all because of a day.  A very spacial day mind you.  A Holy Day unto our God.      Note:  We are not commanded to keep the Sabbath Day Holy, Even in God's Law it is not commanded.  WE ARE told to REMEMBER the SabbathDay to keep it Holy.|`|GBKaftrJaa	Yes.  We are commanded to honor the Sabbath from Genesis chapter 1 and throughout the entire bible, both old and new testament.    When Jesus said he was the Lord of the Sabbath he was saying why it was right to do necessary work like healing, or eating, even if it needed done on the Sabbath which the Pharisees argued it was alright to let a person starve on the Sabbath. Jesus was just clarifying the Sabbath law from the way the Pharisees had twisted it around.    Jesus also said he came to uphold and clarify all the laws and not to do away with any of them.    God spent more time explaining the Sabbath rest than any other law in all of the bible.  And it's the greatest gift he's ever given to us.  Taking the Sabbath rest and spending the day worshiping God is the nicest way to recharge for the next week and recover from the past week.  And God in his mighty wisdom saw it would do that for us so he established it. And he also said this law was eternal and that no man had any right to change his laws in any way.    And Jesus and all his followers in the bible observed the Sabbath properly, not doing any unnecessary work.    So to say that one is a Christian yet blatantly disobey that law is the same as a Christian who commits any other sin.  God will forgive them if they repent of it and ask for forgiveness, but if they have not repented, changed their ways, and asked for forgiveness then they are living in sin and rejecting the salvation that Jesus freely gave them with God's abundent grace.    And of all the laws we are to follow, the Sabbath is the easiest one and such a great blessing to us. Why would anyone not observe it?

She was one of Jesus' most devoted disciples.      "Mary Magdalene is sometimes referred to as a prostitute or adulteress, but she was never called one in the New Testament.   Luke writes that Jesus casts seven demons from her, after which she joins his disciples and provides for them. She witnesses the crucifixion from the foot of the cross, the male disciples having fled. And she was the first witness to the resurrection and was sent by Jesus to tell his other disciples of his return.   Jeffrey Kripal, a religion scholar, wrote, "Migdal or Magdala (meaning "tower" in Hebrew and Arameic respectively) was a fishing town known, or so the legend goes, for its perhaps punning connection to hairdressers (medgaddlela) and women of questionable reputation. This is as close as we get to any clear evidence that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute."  According to Kripal, the identification of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute also goes back to the above-mentioned sermon by Pope Gregory.  In this sermon, Gregory identified Mary as peccatrix, a sinful woman, using her as a model for the repentant sinner, but he did not call her meretrix, a prostitute. However, he also identifies Mary with the adulteress brought before Jesus (as recounted in the Pericope Adulterae, John 8), supporting the view of 3rd and 4th century Church fathers that had already considered this sin as "being unchaste." Gregory's identification and the consideration of the woman's sin as sexual later gave rise to the image of Mary as a prostitute."|`|6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	As salaamu 'alaikym, my unread and misinformed friend.    Insha'Allah, obviously you have never read the New Testament in Konine Greek, Vulgate Latin or English (or any of the other translations that are available...) as Mary of Magdalene is never identified as the "fallen woman" or prostitute in the stories concerning the same such as the woman who anoints the feet of the Prophet Issa, 'alahi wasalaam, or the adulteress who was about to be stoned, etc.    Mary of Magdalene was and is identified as the woman from whom the Prophet Issa, 'alahi wasalaam, cast out demons.    Insha'Allah, you possible have given the Prophet Issa, 'alaihi wasalaam, the Greek name of "Jesus" who was known and is known by both Christians and Muslims as the "Christ" or the Messiah, although the Muslims follow the Judaic understanding of "messiah" rather than the Christian distortion.

KGJGqFalaa	The trinity is a mystical belief.  Many trinitarians believe you cannot use human logic to explain God.    We know that if the Word (Jesus) was with GOD (Jehovah) then logic says the Word is distinct from GOD.  Since there is only ONE GOD then the Word cannot be GOD he can be a god or a divine (godlike one) being but definately not GOD.    To believe the trinity you must believe in mysticism.    I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses    How to recognize counterfeit Christians  http://www.counterfeitchristians.info/|`|AA10472482	If God is a trinity, then anywhere we see the word "God" we should be able to use the word "Trinity" in its place, such as Genesis 1:1 for example. In that case it would read "In the beginning the Trinity created the heavens and the earth." Well that sounds OK. Now let's apply this to John 1:1, 2:    "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the Trinity, and the Word was the Trinity. The same was in the beginning with the Trinity." But how could such a thing be? If the Word was himself a Person and he was with the Trinity, then there would be four Persons. But the Word is said by the trinitarians to be the Second Person of the Trinity, namely, "God the Son." But even then, how could John say that the Word, as God the Son, was the Trinity made up of three Persons? How could one Person be three?    However, let the trinitarians say that in John 1:1 God means just the First Person of the Trinity, namely "God the Father," and so the Word was with God the Father in the beginning. On the basis of this definition of God, how could it be said that the Word, who they say is "God the Son," is "God the Father"? And where does their "God the Holy Ghost" enter into the picture? If God is a Trinity, was not the Word with "God the Holy Ghost" as well as with "God the Father" in the beginning?    Suppose, now, they say that, in John 1:1, 2, God means the other two Persons of the Trinity, so that in the beginning the Word was with God the Father and God the Holy Ghost. In this case we come to this difficulty, namely, that, by being God, the Word was God the Father and God the Holy Ghost, the other two Persons of the Trinity. Thus the Word, or "God the Son," the Second Person of the Trinity, is said to be also the First Person and the Third Person of the Trinity. It does not solve the difficulty to say that the Word was the same as God the Father and was equal to God the Father but still was not God the Father. If this were so, it must follow that the Word was the same as God the Holy Ghost and was equal to God the Holy Ghost but still was not God the Holy Ghost.    And yet the trinitarians teach that the God of John 1:1, 2 is only one God, not three Gods! So is the Word only one-third of God?|`|0yTM98Odaa	John 1:14- "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us"    Clear indication Jesus is God.    Jesus called himself the Son of man.  Luke 6:5- "The Jesus said to them, "The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath"    John 10:30- "I and the Father are one"    John 8:58- "I tell you the truth" Jesus answered."Before Abraham was born, I am"    Revelations 22:13- "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End"    John 20:28- "Thomas said to him,"My Lord and my God"|`|AA11849917	If you change the basic meaning of things, you can make it mean anything you want, and then you can denounce it with perfect logic.    But understand one thing, that people who think they are accomplishing anything when they beat the wind or shadow box or tear down straw men are only deluding themselves.    How many people are you?  If you say "one", you deny that you have a soul or a spirit!    If you say "three", then you are saying you are more than one person, and you need psychiatric help (maybe some psycotropic drugs might possibly help your delusion that you are more than one person).    So, how many ARE you?    Myself, I am one person, yet I consist of a body, a soul, as well as a spirit.  My body is not me, my soul is not me, and my soul is not my body, nor is my body my spirit.  There is only ONE of me, not three!    God is tri-une in nature.  Somehow, He split off His Spirit (soul?) and it occupied a body that was born into this world.    Before He came into this world, He existed WITH God, AS God "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was WITH God, and the Word WAS God."    When he came to earth to inhabit a human body, he became limited by all human limitations "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us"    But He was still God (incarnate in a body) "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and Truth."    He was fully human ("son of Man"), and fully God ("Son of God").    As God, He could forgive sins, command demons, heal the sick, and raise the dead.  (In the Old Testament, the angel cried out to satan, "The LORD rebuke you, satan!" and Jesus came along and rebuked satan - by His own power and authority!)    As Man, He was tired, hungry, sleepy, He wept, and He suffered pain and died on a cross.    He isn't two gods.    There is only one God, just as there is only one of me.    Jesus is God, but you can not say "God is Jesus."  It's the same as when I say "My body is ME, but I am NOT my body!"    The one true God is the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, just as I am one of me, body, soul and spirit.    To deny one is to deny the other, and then you are no longer human.  And as one person so aptly put it, "Never trust anything that looks human, but isn't human, or once was human but isn't any more."|`|A01w1dHqaa	When you are a single parent, do you have to be both father and mother?|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	God is one and 3 persons, the mystery of the Trinity will be revealed at our death, stay tuned it happens to all of us eventually.

You are correct, sir.|`|AA11008046	The Word of God (Bible) is of God and from God but it is not a God in and of itself; and definitely not part of the trinity.  The trinity of God is: God the father, Jesus the Son of God and the Holy Spirit.  these three are one.  Example:  I am a son, I am a father, I am a student of Scriptures - that is 3 things but I am only one person.  In the Godhead it is similar: there are three separate function of the One God.  Unless you relly want to understand this concept you won't.  People who consider themselves "trinitarian" have been arguing this for years.  However, if you take those who call themselves trinitarian and those who believe the three are one and take a look at their origina statement of faith you will see they BOTH believe the same thing - they just have it worded differently.  Check it out for yourself if you want.  You will see the arguement has no basis.  We agree except for how we write it.  that is like you calling me an American or a Canadian.  They both live in N. America - so what is the argument?|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Trinitarians say they believe in 3 persons, and then use the analogy of, "I am a father, and a son & I have a spirit, but I am 1." YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not three PERSONS in 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just 1 w/3 manifestations.    God is ONE.  Galatians 3:20.    Matthew 28:19 says NAME, not names.|`|luwBPdE8aa	The Word is just what it implies:  what God said.  It is not a separate entity.  "The Word was a god" is definitely wrong; there is only one God.  If you have your wits with you, does that make someone besides you?  Don't be sillly.  Actually the Greek says "God was the Word."  God created by speaking.  The trinity is not right either; God is the one and only eternal Holy Spirit.  SJC is right.|`|mFGyonmTaa	Did you just get out of English class?|`|E7fguoVBaa	There is NO trinity.  It is not a real biblical teaching and is from pagan origins.    A PROTESTANT publication states: The word Trinity is not found in the Bible .?.?. It did not find a place formally in the theology of the church till the 4th century. (The Illustrated Bible Dictionary) And a Catholic authority says that the Trinity is not .?.?. directly and immediately [the] word of God.New Catholic Encyclopedia.    Matthew 26:39: Going a little farther he [Jesus Christ] fell on his face and prayed, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. (If the Father and the Son were not distinct individuals, such a prayer would have been meaningless. Jesus would have been praying to himself, and his will would of necessity have been the Fathers will.)    John 8:17,?18: [Jesus answered the Jewish Pharisees:] In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me. (So, Jesus definitely spoke of himself as being an individual separate and distinct from the Father.)

You serve a god who can't do things that are incomprehensible to man? But just to answer your question, pointless though it is, Jesus is the Almighty God. The apostles worshiped Him. Thomas referred to Him as his God. There is only one God and Jesus is God. The Father is God. The Holy Spirit is God. Since there is only one God the trinity is the only thing that makes sense. Your belief of an almighty God and a smaller mighty god is the polytheistic belief. Not the trinity.|`|PWankIUpaa	Sorry but you are applying Earthly Math in a situation where it dose NOT Apply!

You're correct in saying much of this happens today, but the simple fact is, disobedience, is the crux of it all.

Those who regard a freedom from the chains of either religion  or the false moralities of sex as debauched are doing naught   but corrupting their minds with foolishness.      So cast ignorance into the hells of creed and learn of the   world with me. Knowledge has many gifts, one such being   a better way of life.   |`|Ex4Lv68yaa	It has been considered a metaphor for centuries now.  Most of the bible is written in metaphors.    Also remember, most don't believe in the Adam and Eve story - that the whole world is being held accountable for their 'sin.'    In the OT God tells everyone that they are 'personally' accountable for their own mistakes, which has nothing to do with Adam and Eve.|`|15FlstmHaa	Your interpretation is well thought and well formed, but based on an English translation of a...well i'm not sure the language i'd guess latin though...text.  To form the most accurate translation, you'd need to learn whatever language it's originally in.  you seem to like the little words and analogies, but some things may be lost in translation from latin.  so if you want to pick apart words like that, i'd suggest reading the passage in it's original language.|`|JMOLRKRraa	You are missing parts. What is amazing is Adam and Eve didn't think to eat of the Tree of Life, because then they would have lived forever and not died. That is why God kicked them out of the garden so they could not eat of tree of life. God only forbid them from eating of the tree of good and evil. He could have taught them about evil without them digesting it. I can teach a child not to eat poison, without poisoning them   The devil started playing with words, misquoting God.you shall not eat of any tree in the garden. Eve says no tree in the midst, that is incorrect also, God said of the tree of Good and Evil, not all trees in midst of garden. So question is , why didn't Adam eat from Tree of Life when he had the chance?|`|PWankIUpaa	Sir you can hold it tightly however you need a little more study! The Fruit was truly a Fruit , you forget With Whom you are dealing with God Almighty .     Eve's Fruit was to disbelieve God and desire to be her own God which showed she had no power of proper discernment! She had faith in Satin who lead her to the same fate as the 1/3 angels who were led to sin and rebel against God ! She chose to believe a lie and led her husband into that belief system much as the mormons have done under Joseph Smith . He has led and entire group away from God to indulge in sexual misconduct because he desired to reconcile his sin against God and left himself wide open for deception from Satin!     Second The Fruit of the Spirit is not the same thing! The fruit of the Spirit is the Actions which reflect the inter Belief system of that person!     I am very glad that you are studying but be sure to get a good King James Bible . I suspect that you have a book of Mormon and a perverted Bible changed from its Original content !  I hope this is not the case. However the Tim Lahore annotated Bible is a very good Version and Dr. LaHaye's notes are just that notes which have not changed the scriptures from the Original versions at all or in any way!|`|CLB32006aa	It just makes me wonder why god made the tree in the first place or the evil snake for that matter. He is all knowing and all powerful so he already knew they were going to eat it in the first place. Am I getting this right? That means that either god is not all knowing or he wanted man to fall.    Hope this helps  Keep thinking :)|`|SXoxEkfPaa	I think I heard somewhere that the genesis story was written poetically, with rhymes and all. if that's true, the genesis story would obviously be more of a lesson on not letting yourself be fooled by the devil, and not a historicall account, or symbolic historical account.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	I hear you but it did happen..  this is too long...Ive got the Bible  ques should be on the top|`|IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God or Jesus.

AA11327323	I'm sure there are less posts fuelling racial hatred , and that is because we have many yahoo forum members that will call these folk racist.                           We can all just get along, and although I also think the PC group go way over the top, they have helped the situation.to improve.                         But the improvement is not just down to this group,  and the 'getting along' process will still take a long time, it seems to be speeding up.                            This getting along process first came to my attention when I was a lot younger, my wife gave birth to our first child, she soon went to school and one day asked if she could bring a friend home to play, I told her of course she could, she was only around six years old.                           I was home that day my wife collected our daughter and friend from school, I was gobsmacked, there was my daughter walking with a little black girl, they were holding hands and laughing together.                          This little friend had some sort of golliwog type hair style, tufts sticking up  with ribbons  on each tuft.                             Now this was about 45 years ago I had always joined in at work with the usual rascist jokes etc but this event just about floored me.                               This sort of thing is increasing , kids of all ages are mixing together in school, they are growing up together, and working together.                                  We also of course have the culture problem , nothing to do with colour, and then the religion problem.                                I dont have any specific quick fix solution for you, I just think things are very slowly improving,  long time to go yet.

If these massive salaries and bonuses had actually attracted the best, then they wouldn't be whining to the government and tax payers for a bailout.  The companies would be solvent having made good decisions.    What's disgusting is that they think they should be able to continue with the status quo.

If he asks "What?" you might talk about one thing you did wrong *in the past* and what you think the right way would be "going forward".  If he responds with observations of his own (like, "that's more like what the book says" or confessions of his own) you might unload more.  Otherwise you might wait a day or two and start over with "oops" and another little thing.      What *not* to do can be a lot of things.  The best way may be a very small target to hit.  If he seems reluctant to see all the cognitive dissonance, you might write a "procedure" which he can peruse at his own pace, possibly while you sit in jail.  You might also point out that it is a Mitzvah (good deed) to visit people in jail.

She made me a partner in her wealth.  Those are the words of Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) about his first wife  Khadijatul Kurba.    Khadijah, the daughter of Khwalilid, was born 15 years before the year of the elephant, in 555 CE. Her mother was Fatimah Bint Zaidah.  She was a noble, fine-natured wealthy lady of Makah. She married the Prophet when she was 40 and he was only 25. They had six children;   Two boys: Al-Qasim and Abdullah and Four girls: Zainab, Ruqaiyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.    Khadijah lived with the Prophet for 25 years and was his only wife during that time.    When the revelation came from Allah and Muhammad (Pbuh) was made the Prophet, it was Khadijah who immediately accepted the faith and became the first Muslim. She was 55 years old at the time. Her acceptance of Islam greatly helped it spread amongst the Makkans. She stood by the Prophet all the time.    The Prophet and Khadijah had many sorrows. They had to bear the death of their sons Al-Qasim and Abdullah in their infancy and in the fifth year of the prophet-hood their daughter Ruqaiyah travelled to Abyssinia with her husband, Uthman Bin Affan.    Khadijah had to also bear enormous strain and suffering during the boycott at Shibi Abi Talib for three years.    She died on the 10th during Ramadan at the age of 65. Her death was a great loss to the Prophet.     Muslim women should emulate the example of Khadijah who loved her husband dearly and did everything of Allahs sake. We need more women like Khadijah today.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Masha Allah    In Sura Yaseen Allah says " Reward for Ahsan is only Ahsan"   Khadija (ra) did Ahsan on Islam.

Khadija realised just how much money was to be made by forcing her husband's new religion on people and happily assisted him on his crusades to convert or extort taxation. Only after the death of Khadija did the new religion become nasty towards women. Marrying 4 women was suddenly permitted, something Khadija would not have agreed to. Her death was not just a great loss to Mohammed but to all the women who subsequently followed his teachings. If Khadija has outlived Mohammed she could have kept him in check and Islam would be a far far better religion today that it became without her superb guidance.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA11849917	Belief in Jesus and belief in evolution are diametrically opposed.    They represent two totally opposite views and perspectives.    Belief in Jesus means you acknowledge you are a sinner.  This means that you acknowledge that sin is real, and that sin entered the world at some given point, and that death is the result of sin.    To believe in evolution denies the culpability of the human race as ever having committed some kind of "original sin", as we have "evolved" into what we are, over time, and what you would consider "sin" is just evolved traits of survival.    For evolution to be true, there had to be many millions of deaths prior to the emergence of homo sapiens or "modern man", which is direct contradiction to the Biblical statement that because sin entered the world, death was passed on to all men.    Even Jesus spoke of Adam and Eve as real people, not just parables or metaphor or whatever.    No, evolution and Christianity can NEVER mix.    Additional comment to those believe that each day in Genesis 1 represented a thousand or more years:    The word "day" ("yom" in Hebrew) is ALWAYS translated as "day", and in every other place, it is never defined.    Yet, in Genesis 1, "yom" is defined as "an evening and a morning".     If one day ("yom") represented a thousand years, then there would be a period of darkness 500 years long, followed by a period of light for 500 years.    How is THAT conducive to evolution?  How is that conducive to ANY kind of life?    Furthermore, what kind of power would speed the earth enough to shorten this 1,000 year rotation (darkness followed by light "evening and morning") so that it would only rotate in 24 of our hours?  If the earth were moving THAT slowly (1,000 years to rotate once on it's axis), friction would slow it down, not speed it up!    And if you think that GOD just miraculously caused the world to speed up, then why not just accept that miraculously God brought forth life and a complete eco system in six 24-hour days?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no way..|`|HGadAqG9aa	i believe in micro-evolution. not evolution. soup|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. I have been on the fence on the two. Peace|`|SXoxEkfPaa	don't let yourself be fooled by american christians (where creationism is even significant). most christian denominations accept some kind of "guided" evolution, and even a guided big bang.  in my opinion it's still ilogical but at least they don't shut their eyes to the scientific community.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	The Pope, for one.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Not this Christian.

It is simply a scientific explanation of how He Created it.|`|89MKzLl3aa	I believe in evolution as a process of change so that life can evolve in order to survive in it's natural surroundings. What does that have to do with Christianity? Adam and Eve are the male and female names of the first people on earth. If you read Genesis, you will see that God created man and woman. Then there is a separate section that explains why Adam and Eve were expelled from paradise to fend for themselves. The bible is more allegorical than anything else. Jesus taught using parables so that the people could take the stories and apply them to their experiences.    What is important is to trust in God's Word, rather it's stated in parables or literally. There isn't a justifiable reason to not be a Christian and a believer of evolution.    Edit: Jesus purpose was to give us Salvation from our sins so that we will receive eternal life as a reward for our service. It has nothing to do with how we were created or evolved. This isn't my opinion, it's in the bible in parables and in literal form.    Edit2:Micro-evolution is evident. Although Macro-evolution is theory, why would that contradict God. God made all livings things, that throughout the ages evolved. That idea is plausible in science as well as in the bible.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	The Bible and it's stories were inspired by God, not written by Him.  If the writers of Genesis were to tell the people about evolution and the big bang they wouldn't have gotten many listeners. So they told it in a way that could be understood by the common folk.  I believe God created the universe but how He did it is of no concern to me.   From an intellectual point of view it's interesting how it all happened but I don't let the morality stories in the Bible and all the contradictions sway me from my belief in Him.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	"In His Likeness and Image.

The word ambivalent comes to mind.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	> Are there any Christians that believe in the theory of Evolution and in Jesus Christ?    Most Christians believe that. If you want specifics you can start with these almost twelve thousand Christian clergy from the US alone. http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_...     > Christ came as a direct result of Adam's sin - which resulted in all humans dying.    Dying spiritually, not physically  at least according to common Christian interpretation. http://www.gotquestions.org/spiritual-de...    > So, it means that unless you believe that God created Adam, you cannot accept Christ's salvation.    Whats to keep you from believing God created Adam using evolution?     > The Orthodox Churches accept the story of the Creation as Real.    Actually they dont:   The Holy Orthodox Church teaches that the Old Testament's purpose is NOT to record literal history, but to explain the relationship of God and man. What is critical to our Faith is in the Creed and all it says about Creation is that God the Father is the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible and that He did so through His Son, Christ Jesus. It does not say, nor does it require us to know HOW God created, but simply to know that God created.    All this controversy has arisen in relatively recent times because of the Protestant concept of Sola Scriptura. When they discarded the wisdom of Holy Tradition, all they were left with was the Bible itself and this creates a certain logical dilemma: with nothing concrete to guide you, how do you know what is literal and which is not, unless you treat it ALL as literal? Orthodoxy, happily, does not have that problem to contend with. http://en.allexperts.com/q/Eastern-Ortho...    > How is it Christians can accept evolution (i.e. that we weren't created, but that we evolved) when the entire purpose of Christ's birth and coming was to return man back to the state he was created in!?    Again, why are you assuming God couldnt have created man using evolution?    > The Protestant, Orthodox, and Catholic Creeds that are from NICEA state clearly "WE BELIEVE IN ONE GOD, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH".    You dont need to shout. And nothing in evolution contradicts that belief.    > How can the faithful say that they believe in macro-evolution and claim to be Christian?    Rather than ask how a Christian could be an evolutionist, Id ask the reverse. All christians acknowledge that the Bible was inspired by God but written by men. They also acknowledge that parts of the Bible should not be read literally, but must be interpreted in context. (Such as the part where God tells Adam that on the day he eats from the Tree hell surely die.) And Christians must also acknowledge that the evidence we find in nature supporting evolution must have been purposely left by God. Created directly by His will. Not filtered through the writings of men or requiring contextual interpretation. To ignore the evidence of evolution is to ignore God. To place ones personal interpretation of the writings of men above Gods own handiwork is idolatry and arrogance. Most Christians get that.|`|ueP6VXevaa	I often say it takes much more faith to accept evolution that it does to believe in God.|`|jcrPpPvqaa	Creation needs a creator, the bible tells us God created the heavens and earth....that's what I believe!    Micro-evolution happens all the time and is perfectly Biblical. Creatures adapt! But Macro-evolution  says creatures evolve into completely different species with new, additional genetic information, but this theory has no supporting evidence that I have found.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	There are many who believe both. I am NOT one of them.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Many Christians are not so hide-bound that they can not accept new scientific knowledge as it comes along.

Why can God's creation not have occured over 6 billion years?|`|UkKEvilYaa	Yes there are, and as you have stated they are undermining the very reason for the Gospel message. I was an Atheist and believed in evolution for 47 years. I was then challenged to take another look. I did and discovered many flaws in the theory. I looked at the science and found that we do have a Creator. There are many Christians who will try and fit evolution into God's word instead of looking at the evidence and seeing that God's word is true. We all look at the same evidence it all depends on what your world view is on how you interpret it. There is no such thing as an unbiased person, we all have our own assumptions. As a Christian you have to ask do I believe the fallible word of fallen man or the authority of God?|`|JMOLRKRraa	Well....  The likeness was the Glory of God, an immortal state without death or sin.  Reread Genesis first few chapters, without the Bible I reasoned how one being could evolve into another with God starting it. however upon my recent reread, God made fish and birds, separate from the water. Interesting I just saw a flying dragon, lizard. looked like wings of butterfly from lizard, so I can see how fish evolved to fowl.   However animals and beasts were made from earth,  not sea, water. So now I envision God with his dirt clay forming the animal, taking them to Adam to name them. When looking for a mate . friend for Adam no animal would do, not the ape, monkey whatever, so God made woman. So man you sit across the dinner table with your wife not a monkey or elephant. read the Bible, real slow, again|`|BMQlzUkfaa	I am a Christian.  I do not believe that fish evolved into lizards, to apes, and finally into man.  I do believe that God created all things and commanded them to multiply within their own species.    Throughout time their are definitely changes in species.  Such as men and women becoming taller, or other changes in physical attributes but I do not believe that a man or woman or any other kind of being that God has created will never turn into something completely different.|`|zWj6HXHNaa	Catholics accept evolution and science in general, others depend on their on what the main figure says.    When people are educated properly they understand that evolution does not contradict the existence of a god.|`|yakmXr5Jaa	Yes.  I believe God created everything on heaven and earth.  I believe the Genesis story is real.  And I also accept evolution.  There are some claims by evolutionary scientists that I don't accept.  Obviously I don't believe that life started by random, but that doesn't mean you throw out the whole model.  Too much of the evolutionary model is backed up by mountains of evidence.    Believing in God and believing that He created everything does not mean you have to believe in creatio ex nihilo.    I would like to hear more about what you mean when you use the word "evolution".  If you think of evolution as a word that means "life was generated by random" then you don't have a very good grasp of what evolution is, because it is a huge model with sweeping statements about all life as we know it.    And evolution really only covers the changes in a species after it already exists.  That doesn't contradict God's story of creation.  If you get back into the history of how life originated, you are suddenly outside of the realm where we have evidence, and there is very little concrete in the evolutionary model.

When he called upon his Sustainer saying: "Verily harm has afflicted me, and You are the Most Merciful of the Merciful."    The supplication of Job (Upon whom be peace), the champion of patience, is both well-tested and effective. Drawing on the verse, we should say in our supplication,    O my Sustainer! Indeed harm has afflicted me, and You are the Most Merciful of the Merciful.    The gist of the well-known story of Job (Upon whom be peace) is as follows:    While afflicted with numerous wounds and sores for a long time, he recalled the great recompense to be had for his sickness, and endured it with utmost patience. But later, when the worms generated by his wounds penetrated to his heart and his tongue, the seat of the remembrance and knowledge of God, he feared that his duty of worship would suffer, and so he said in supplication not for the sake of his own comfort, but for the sake of his worship of God:    "O Lord! Harm has afflicted me; my remembrance of You with my tongue and my worship of You with my heart will suffer." God Almighty then accepted this pure sincere, disinterested and devout supplication in the most miraculous fashion. He granted to Job perfect good health and made manifest in him all kinds of compassion. This Flash contains Five Points:         FIRST POINT   Corresponding to the outer wounds and sicknesses of Job (Upon whom be peace), we have inner sicknesses of the spirit and heart. If our inner being was to be turned outward, and our outer being turned inward, we would appear more wounded and diseased than Job. For each sin that we commit and each doubt that enters our mind, inflicts wounds on our heart and our spirit.    The wounds of Job (Upon whom be peace) were of such a nature as to threaten his brief worldly life, but our inner wounds threaten our infinitely long everlasting life. We need the supplication of Job thousands of times more than he did himself. Just as the worms that arose from his wounds penetrated to his heart and tongue, so too the wounds that sin inflicts upon us and the temptations and doubts that arise from those wounds will may God protect us! penetrate our inner heart, the seat of belief, and thus wound belief. Penetrating too the spiritual joy of the tongue, the interpreter of belief, they cause it to shun in revulsion the remembrance of God, and reduce it to silence.    http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2902&...      First Station      In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.     And when We told the angels: Prostrate before Adam, they prostrated, except Iblis.1 * God commands that you sacrifice a cow.2 * And yet after all this your hearts hardened and became like rocks or even harder.3     One day while reading this verses, three points were imparted to me against the promptings of Satan from the effulgence of the Qur'an. His suggestions took this form:    He said: "You say the Qur'an is a miracle, and of infinite eloquence, and that it is guidance for everyone at all times. And so what is the meaning in its persistently repeating in historical form certain minor events like the following: how is it appropriate to mention an insignificant event like the slaughtering of a cow in terms of something significant, and even naming that important Sura, 'The Cow'? Also the event of 'prostrating before Adam'; it is rnerely a matter of the Unseen and cannot be understood by the reason. It may be submitted to and accepted with certainty only after a strong belief has been obtained. Whereas the Qur'an instructs those who use their reasons; in many places it says: So will you not think?, and refers what it says to the reason. Also, what is the guidance in showing to be important, certain natural conditions of rocks which are the results of chance?"     The form of the Points which were imparted to me is this:     FIRST POINT: In the All-Wise Qur'an are numerous minor events behind each of which is concealed a universal principle, and which are shown as the tip of a general law. For example,     He taught Adam the Names, all of them.4         --------------------------------------...      1.Qur'an, 2:34. 2. Qur'an, 2:67. 3. Qur'an, 2:74. 4. Qur'an, 2:31.         --------------------------------------...      This is the 'teaching of the Names', which was a miracle of Adam before the angels because of his ability to be God's vicegerent, and was a minor event. But it is the tip of a universal principle which is as follows: it was the teaching, due to man's comprehensive disposition, of countless sciences, and numerous all-embracing branches of knowledge about the universe, and extensive learning about the Creator's attributes and qualities, which afforded man superiority over not only the angels but also the heavens and earth and mountains in the question of the bearing of the Supreme Trust. And like the Qur'an states that through his comprehensive disposition, man is God's spiritual vicegerent on earth, so too, the minor event in the Unseen of the angels prostrating before Adam and Satan not prostrating is the tip of a most broad and universal observed principle; these hint at a most extensive truth which is as follows:     Through mentioning the angels' obedience and submission before the person of Adam, and Satan's pride and refusal, the Qur'an makes understood that most of the physical beings in the universe and their representatives and appointed beings are subjugated to man, and that man's senses are predisposed and amenable to benefiting from all of them. And pointing out what a fearsome enemy and serious obstacle in the path of man's progress are evil matter and it|`|NNmuZw1Kaa	1. Exactly....some are parables and some are history to contemplate.  2.

Sola pasar el tiempo con mis primos. *    Sola ir a la playa y nadar.    Sola leer cuentos con my abuela    Sola jugar en la nieve.    Sola pasar el tiempo con mi perro.

w8D0ktFmaa	There is no such thing as "theistic evolution." There is only the junk science of "creationism," which has been laughed out of the legitimate scientific community (and all otherwise intelligent humans) because it's absurd.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	It's still fantasy, not science.    It's closer to reality in the same way a story where a senator is an alien is closer to reality than a story in which aliens have taken control of the entire senate.|`|AA11297267	There's nothing scientific about "theistic evolution."  That idea takes the *science* of evolution and tacks on a premise that is completely without evidence to support it -- that "god" somehow started and controlled evolution.      There's no evidence of any kind that any "god" had anything to do with evolution.  It's called evolution by *natural* selection for a reason -- all natural, nothing supernatural shown or needed.    So...no.  It's not science.  And it can't be taught as science.    Peace.|`|usfVqbajaa	intelligent design isn't a very intelligent theory.. or whatever it is|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no it stinks and sucks...|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Anything is closer to reality than ID. That alone does not make it real, nor should it be taught in schools.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	is there evidence for god?    no    therefore no theistic evolution can not be taught in public schools...not in science class anyway, maybe in a philosophies course or a religions course but not science.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	No, it can't.    It posits the intervention of a supernatural being.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	How about we just stick with teaching evolution and keep the religious nonsense in churches?    It is just another poorly veiled attempt to force the indoctrination of impressionable minds into religious delusion.    Whether you call it 'creationism', 'intelligent design', or 'theistic evolution' it is still NOT science, it's mythology.    As soon as you introduce the necessity of a deity, it immediately loses any connection to the teaching of scientific facts.     Why not teach 'theistic gravity', or 'theistic nuclear physics'?|`|luwBPdE8aa	I think the schools should leave religion to the churches and parents, but they should tell the truth about evolution.

Until there is definitive evidence of God, I don't think he belongs in a science class.|`|G9dZN8omaa	Depends on the US school.  If you mean Public schools, then No.  If you mean Private schools, then Yes.    Public schools cannot teach the belief in any God.  Period.  The most it can do is teach an objective, optional course about the different things different people believe in.  (For example:  "Christians believe in Jesus Christ.  Jews do not. Wiccans believe in the Mother Goddess." and so forth.)|`|FhHklqkhaa	evolution is factual  trying to make it theistic is unrealistic and unprovable|`|zQyslfHKaa	Heh    Nope its the same thing with a newer name.    God isn't required.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	evolution does not need or imply theism of any kind|`|k4WlqPK7aa	no, evolution stands on its own without fictional intervention.|`|0RcnOgA7aa	It definatly can't.|`|RyhluHk3aa	It will come as a surprise to many to learn that evolution is not a modern idea, spawned by the pressure of scientific evidence.   Evolutions roots go back several millennia; back to ancient Babylon and Sumer.    The word evolution means unfolding.   When applied to the creation of the universe it tacitly supposes that God, at best, had a more-or-less passive role in the history of the creation.   By God I mean, of course, the God of the Bible.   The ancients had other gods which they held accountable for the creation.   The earliest surviving extra-Biblical account of the creation  came to us from the ancient Babylonians.   The Babylonian creation accounts are typified by that found in the Epic of Gilgamesh.   From said epic we learn that the Babylonians believed the universe to have had a chaotic beginning.      Some centuries later, under Alexander the Great, the Greeks inherited the Babylonian culture, complete with its mythol-ogy.   In the Greek writings we find a strong reinforcement of the superstition of evolution: that the world as we now know it was not created in its present form and that the life it bears evolved into its present forms through tens of millennia.   To the Greeks the creator of the universe was the god, Chaos.   The most prominent Greek advocates of evolution were Thales, Anaximenes, Aristotle and Lucretius.    Although the Greek myths of the creation were interpolated from the Babylonian before 200 B.C., we can still find the same myth in modern science.   Today, scientists no longer share quite the same animistic theological bent as held by the ancient Greeks and so it is that modern science does not claim that the god, Chaos, created the universe.   So as not to smack of the super-natural, science instead drops the title god and writes the gods name with a lower-case letter.   Hence modern science claims that the cosmos came into being, by chance (or chaos) and that it had a chaotic beginning (that is, it exploded into existence).   Though other terminology may be used today, the idea is still basically the same as that held by the ancient Greeks; the only difference being that the modern version of cosmogony avoids using the words god and creator.    Reality, huh? Okay.
4LYasBGXaa	sounds like what you need is a psyciatrist.    "lust" is not evil- it is natural, there is a world of difference between spreading your legs for every tom, dick and harry (pardon the unintentional pun) that comes along and haivng normal sexual desires for a person who you like.    sexual desire is a manifestation of your desire for intimacy and closeness with someone- both physical and mental.    or it could be that you just want to get laid- however i suspect its the first.    there is nothing wrong with either.  actually the bible and the "7 deadly sins" (allegedly sins) are based not upon comitting the act, but committing it to excess.    everyone feels pride, lust, eats (gluttony), sloth (you sleep don't you?).    even within the contexts of your own religious mumbo jumbo- you are doing nothing wrong.|`|gAGnRHIUaa	Short answer is yes. Each of us is a sinner even those of us who are believers. God loves the sinner not the sin. You do not say if you actually know this boy.

VdTn7Gmbaa	Have you read "90 Minutes in Heaven?"  Rather than perhaps see a false light from lucifer, I think I would much rather have an experience like is written in this book.    On the way home from a conference, Don Piper's car was crushed by a truck that crossed into his lane. Medical personnel said he died instantly.    While his body lay lifeless inside the ruins of his car, Piper experienced the glories of heaven, awed by its beauty and music.    90 minutes after the wreck, while a minister prayed for him, Piper miraculously returned to life. His faith in God was severely tested as he faced an uncertain and gruelling recovery.    90 Minutes in Heaven offers a glimpse into a very real dimension of eternity. It encourages those recovering from serious injuries and those dealing with the loss of a loved one. The experience dramatically changed Piper's life, and it will change yours too.    "Don Piper's ninety minutes in heaven changed his life and his perspective. Reading his book will give you the assurance that God is faithful to bring you through even the most horrific of circumstances. May his eyewitness account of the hope that lies before you change your perspective of this life as well!"    Michael Carter, CBN chief financial director       May God bless you with truth.      http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/90_minutes_in...|`|KouNp7yUaa	no but my sister has and she has done it about 5 times and everytime she said that it was dark and not light|`|gHRYTm8gaa	Yes i broke both my legs and my arm off a ski-jump. this caused my heart to fail due to its over working trying to pump blood to the cells in the legs and arm. I quickly got to a hospital with the help of a friend and an ambulance. They quickly put me under. This is when it happened i thought it was the end of the surgery when i got up but i quickly realized it wasn't. I saw a very bight light, it was the brightest i had ever seen. The thing with this light was that it was very very bright but it did not hurt my eyes at all. I tried to get up to go to the light because it felt like it was calling to me, but i could not. I passed out and woke-up to find myself sitting in a recovery bed. My arms and legs were very sore but i was alive.It was the most amazing experience of my life and i regret not being able to go to the light.|`|amDYXKPCaa	yes, when I was 13 I had 24 hours to live. I had a brain tumor and  I was about to die. When I went into surgery, I saw this tunnel thing, and was walking down it. I saw a waterfall and a beautiful place. Somewhere I can relax. I saw my great grandmother there, and my best friend who had died over the winter on a ski accident. I was about to walk in, and they stopped me, and pushed me back. It stung my chest. Then they pushed me back again and it stung my chest. I woke up and I saw I was being shocked with those things they rub together and say "clear".   I'm doing great now.

AA11707728	Yes.  There are a whole bunch of pheromone products produced by various companies.  Many are good.  Too many are scams.    A good place for info on this is the Pherotalk Forum.  This board is run by Androtics Direct but people post their experiences with various products both made by them and other companies.  It's quite an active board.  Read the stickies at the top of the Men's Forum:    http://www.pheromonetalk.com/    I've used alot of different products.  In my opinion, there are only two really reliable sources to buy pheromones.  The first is Love Scent.  They sell alot of different brands made by various manufacturers.  They are very good at only selling legitimate brands.  So much so that I am a bit leery of anything I come across that isn't sold by Love Scent.  The other source is Androtics Direct, which makes all its own stuff.  They are probably the best products available anywhere.    The easiest and most direct way to experience what pheromones do is to just try them.  I'd recommend Ammunition, by Androtics Direct.  It's probably the best stand alone product for attraction there is.  It also comes in small "togo" bottles that only cost about $12.  That's enough for like 40 sprays....plenty to spend a few weeks testing it out without risking too much money.    http://www.androticsdirect.com/product.p...|`|TY21iw5taa	To my knowledge,there have been some studies that show response to hormones present in sweat(altering of sexual mood; mainly androstadienone),but I don't think buying products with the stuff in them will work much as a magic potion would.lol.

The Church did not make any cash contribution.    ADDITIONAL INFO:  Fox13 (Utah): The documents show the amount spent by the Mormon Church is greater than what was initially stated.     Fact: The Church, like other organizations on both sides of the ballot issue, was required to publicly file these donations by the 31 January deadline. The Church has been filing required contribution reports throughout the campaign. Those earlier donations initially stated were filed for specific time periods prior to this last reporting period, as required by law. Other groups are also filing their final contribution reports to meet the same deadline.     San Francisco Chronicle : Mormon church officials, facing an ongoing investigation by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, Friday reported nearly $190,000 in previously unlisted assistance to the successful campaign for Prop. 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California.   Sacramento Bee : The disclosure comes amid an investigation by the state's campaign watchdog agency into whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints violated state laws by not fully disclosing its involvement during the campaign.     Fact: This filing is in no way prompted by an investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission. Many organizations are filing this week to meet the deadline required by law. We believe we have complied with California law.     KFMB 760 AM (San Diego) :    Mormon Church Misstated How Much It Spent in Prop 8 Fight.   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints previously claimed only about $2,000 was spent in support of the measure.   365Ga y : Mormon Church admits it spent 100 times more for Prop 8 than reported     Fact: Again, the previous disclosure of an in-kind donation was to meet an earlier deadline. In fact, previous filings detailed over $50,000 out of the total non-monetary contribution of $189,903.58.This weeks filing reported donations that fell within a different time period and required reporting by the 31 January deadline. Other groups also made their final contributions reports this week.|`|AA11297267	In *official* papers filed with the California secretary of state last November (in time for the deadline for declaring contributions, including "in-kind" donations), the mormon church documented that it had spent $2,089 IN TOTAL on the campaign.  At the same time, the official church spokesperson said, "The church of jesus christ of latter days saints has spent zero money on this campaign."    Three months later, after the legal filing deadline, and after an investigation into their true involvement had begun, the church filed official documents with the california secretary of state indicating they had spent the amount you mentioned (90 times what they originally claimed and reported), and are now trying to downplay the damage.  They clearly lied on the first report (violating the law), filed a false official report (violating the law), didn't report the actual amount spent by the legal deadline (violating the law)...and lied in official public statements (which isn't illegal, but is unethical).    As penalty for violating the law, their non-profit status should be revoked, and they should have a huge fine levied on them.  We, the people of california, will not stand for hypocritical, dishonest out-of-state religious organizations coming into our state and illegally influencing our election process, and violating the law.    edit for comments above:  this isn't about whether they spent money or not -- it's about them LYING about how much money they spent in official government documents, and about them violating the election and reporting laws.  If they had honestly reported by the reporting deadline what they spent, there would be no problem.  They didn't -- they lied and broke the law.    Peace.|`|FmazIF6Maa	I am pro-same sex marriage.

I would generally agree with that, but in the case of religion, some religious beliefs are impossible for an outsider to 'step into the shoes of'.|`|TMb076n6aa	Becuase some people are so insecure they have to use the bible so they can feel superior especailly those who are using the bible posting hate rants toward women.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	it is an attempt to help the deluded

That reminds me of when parents allow their children to throw absolute tantrums in stores, or even worse- the other morning when I was at the gas station trying to get a cup of coffee, as were about 5 other adults, one of them was having their two children under 5 years old prepare their particular cup of coffee while they stood on the side and instructed.  The kids were carrying hot pots of coffee, tripping the other adults, causing the experience to last 5 times longer than it should have, people getting to work late, all because a parent was inconsiderate.|`|s6YmD7vaaa	Some people are so ignorant they don't realize how rude & inconsiderate they are - no to mention how stupid it is to put a small child on a high counter.|`|YSuc7L8taa	No one should sit on a counter top.

aFaSMYPFaa	they are KIDS. Ifs awsome that in your head you are cool and you can accept yourself :) dont lose that! This phase in your life WILL come to an end at a point trust me. As people grow up it seriously matters less and less if you were in the 'cool group' or anything. I was never the popular one at school. I was sent to a really posh private school where everyone in my school all either had their private jets or maids and servants etc etc. I was naturally an outcast for not wearing their designer clothes or having a big fat house or whatever.. But the years pass and you find people that will accept you for who you are :)    I personally think its great that you have the confidence to believe in yourself when people put you down. You're dealing with it amazingly!|`|7w9zXLGMaa	they are quick to judge you on your weight and dont give you a chance to show them how cool you are... you dont need to be their friend but if you really want to.. i suggest you laugh with them when they make a joke about you. then theyll stop. they feed off of your reaction.  another option is to start from the bottom. get normal friends and eventually they have friends more popular and so on. get it :D|`|7ES4xMloaa	because you talk like you stepped out of the 70's. but serously kid school is a brutal place with alot of immature people aka the studants when you leave school things will get better|`|GpO17WZ4aa	because you are fat|`|0RcnOgA7aa	You are cool everyone's  cool in their own way don't be sad I think your cool.  kridden|`|8n3NvYQwaa	get in shape, they look at you as an outsider because you are large...

Anyways, I'm sure you are actually very cool and the problem here is they JUST DON'T KNOW YOU!     And I know I sound like a therapist, but if they don't accept you for stupid reasons like being "fat" (that is plain wierd and they are so immature, a personality is a personality wherever whenever) then why do you want to be accepted by them?     To me, they are not "cool" at all but rather low. As you grow you realize cool is not what brands you wear, who you hang out with etc etc but actually who you are. To me, "cool" is someone who is loving generous maybe even a little funny and therefore popular in that sense.    Goodluck fitting in, there are ALWAYs people out there who can understand you and vice versa.|`|mW39emMdaa	drop some fat maybe because u're fat,if u lose some size that might make they see u as a cool person|`|znHTUp6Uaa	Just be yourself, you don't have to change just so your accepted.

Most religions do teach that a person should not lie or steal, and so forth. But is that sufficient? Would you be happy to drink a glass of poisoned water because someone assured you that most of what you were getting was water?    2?Cor. 11:14,?15: Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness. (Here we are cautioned that not everything that originates with Satan may appear hideous. One of his chief methods of deceiving mankind has been false religion of all kinds, to some of which he gives a righteous appearance.)    2?Tim. 3:2,?5: Men will be .?.?. having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. (Regardless of their outward professions of love for God, if those with whom you worship do not sincerely apply his Word in their own lives, the Bible urges you to break off such association.)|`|XiITTg3waa	RELIGION--------------- BAD !!

But to have a religion that has a mighty loving GOD behind it, well, it would be the one that I would choose. So I choose JESUS!|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	I like Christianity, specifically I am a Lutheran. This is the basic Christian message: God is eternal, holy, perfect, love. God loves us all and wants us all to go to heaven to be with Him forever after we die. But, we aren't perfect, for sure. So, God sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, to be a model of how we should live in this world and as the bridge to God. When we become a Christian, we accept Jesus into our life as our Lord and Savior forever. When we do that, we receive God's blessing and forgiveness, guidance and protection and go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian. You could call a few Christian churches near you and see what they are doing.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."  --C.S. Lewis    I am a democrat [believer in democracy] because I believe in the Fall of Man. I think most people are democrats for the opposite reason. A great deal of democratic enthusiasm descends from the ideas of people like Rousseau, who believed in democracy because they thought mankind so wise and good that every one deserved a share in the government. The danger of defending democracy on those grounds is that they're not true. . . . I find that they're not true without looking further than myself. I don't deserve a share in governing a hen-roost. Much less a nation. . . . The real reason for democracy is just the reverse. Mankind is so fallen that no man can be trusted with unchecked power over his fellows. Aristotle said that some people were only fit to be slaves. I do not contradict him. But I reject slavery because I see no men fit to be masters. ("Equality," in C. S.

For a single "order" to exist, everyone would have to submit to a single doctrine.  That's not likely to happen.

Not many asians actually practice yoga, that I know.    As for meditation associated asian culture, that's true but I still have not heard of any type of prejudice associated with meditation. Also there are quite a few asian people who do not practice any type of meditation.

xLKPKgZXaa	I think that it is extremely sad that a woman feels that she has to do that whereas the men of those countries do not have to prove their virginity.      It is quite sick that, in many cultures, it seems that only a female can be guilty of having sex before marriage whilst men always get away with it.      It is completely hypocritical and is prevalent in most countries to some extent, the reason being that men can hide or deny their 'indiscretions' but women cannot.    Of those people who do not try to hide their indiscretions the women tend to be referred to a harlot, a whore, a tramp, a slag etc. whereas men tend to be referred to as a 'stud'.  So much for equality.|`|TFUvMKPraa	It's tragic.|`|fqRBdOWLaa	Not only muslim girls do this. You should better refer either to... provincial ones, which live in a patriarchal society.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Ms Crone, it is time to acquire an attorney. If their constant visits to your home are making you feel unsafe then they ARE causing harm to you and you are entitled to: 1. have then cease and desist immediately, 2. be compensated for that harm, and 3. legally restrain them from any further incursions onto your property under ANY guise.    Additionally, you may hold both them personally as well as the organization which they represent, criminally and financially liable for all damages, past, present, and future.    I would find an attorney who wil take your concerns seriously. If one can't be found locally then search beyond your area. Contact the ACLU who may be able to refer you to an excellent and competent attorney who may even take the case on, pro bono. In either event, NOW is the time to document everything and begin to CYA, legally. GET an attorney, and one who specializes in cases of discrimination. This is very important, as he/she will tel you how to go about documenting all the evidence that could be used in a trial hearing.    Brightest Blessings,  Raji the Green Witch|`|Lk4aCBACaa	I agree wholeheartedly with Raji: contact an attorney, see what you can do about restraining orders, etc. Your family has been in this area for generations, and you shouldn't have to leave because of bigotry and harassment. You can't make them stop being bigots, but under law they can be made not to actively harass you and yours, so please use every legal tool at your disposal.    If it were me personally, my own sheer stubbornness would bolster my "I have as much right to be here as anyone else!" attitude for awhile at least. But it would really depend on how much of a connection I felt to the place. I had no problem leaving my hometown, because my family was the only thing keeping me there and I can always visit them. The area I live now still has a few nuts, but is much more tolerant overall than where I was before. I don't get harassed in grocery stores because someone notices my religious symbol, for example.    As always, stay safe and don't let them get you down. :) I hope that some of the Christians here who seem to think such things "just don't happen" will see your story and realize what kinds of things are being done in the name of their faith, and what *real* persecution looks like. There are good Christians out there, but it seems they're sorely outnumbered by the bad ones in your neck of the woods. Take care.|`|TRt4tWGFaa	60, do you own the house if so call the law./.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	no they could not even if they try .... what I believe in has nothing to do with where I live...|`|CLB32006aa	I would defend myself from the fanatics.  -atheist|`|LjsRfaskaa	No, we stayed and suffered the consequences becasue there was no where for us to go.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

We can debate this until we are blue in the face and the fact remains that he was perfect regardless of if he had children or not.  There is nothing in the bible stating that he had children but there are verses pointing to the "beloved disciple" and it is NEVER explained who that disciple is.  So is it possible it was his child....maybe...does that change who Jesus was or his message?  Absolutely not.  He was a man and he was tempted on every level just like we are but he didn't give into evil things...to us...sex can be evil and lustful but not to him...maybe leaving that out of the bible was a good thing if it were true because with our human minds we can't concieve of sexual relations as anything but lustful, it would have caused us confusion.|`|AA11008046	Jesus time on earth was fulfillment of prophesy.

All we know is what was written by other people in parable form, translated from language to language.       In those days it was not ok for a Jewish Rabbi (teacher) to be single.  It was a cultural thing.   I do think he was like any other guy but with much more insight and understanding, quite radical and outspoken, and a willingness to teach others in spite of Roman suppression.   That is why he had to travel so much, to speak to the people.    The Romans wanted him shut up - he was giving the people too much hope for freedom.   Also understand that women were owned in those days, as not much more than another animal.   Men had harems and slaves.   Mary Magdelena was from another area and from a wealthy family (she was not a prostitute - that was a confusion of Marys)   and considered very much a participant in helping Jesus spread the word.        If you look at Da Vinci's painting of the Last Supper,  you can see what looks like a woman on Jesus' right.   A couple of the Disciples complained about Jesus loving one of them the most, and kissing that one.  (in bible)  Most likely it was Mary Magdelena.   I think she may have been his companion or wife at that time.    But the scribes/disciples could not have written about her because it would not have been accepted in those times.    The message was more important than who was married and who wasn't.       Finally, it would have been way too weird for that gang of friends to not have wives or at least companions.

He spent the first 13 verses reminding Timothy what it means to be Christians and spread the good news. In verse 14 he tells Timothy to remind other Christians of these things and to stop fighting amongst themselves over matters, probably doctrinal issues, since arguing over doctrine might turn away listeners from the faith. I think verses 22-26 sum it up nicely!|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	that is where the collection plate came from|`|w8D0ktFmaa	I'll have to go with GallvantinGalaticGadfly as best answer. I'll just add that this Timothy verse is what the Roman Catholic Church (the first Christian denomination - take that, Protestant!) most probably used to justify the solicitation of money from their gullible flock for "church building." It has nothing to do with "wrangling" over inane words.|`|AA11188574	(2 Timothy 2:14-19) 14?Keep reminding them of these things, charging them before God as witness, not to fight about words, a thing of no usefulness at all because it overturns those listening. 15?Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright. 16?But shun empty speeches that violate what is holy; for they will advance to more and more ungodliness, 17?and their word will spread like gangrene. Hy?me?naeus and Phi?letus are of that number. 18?These very [men] have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some. 19?For all that, the solid foundation of God stays standing, having this seal: Jehovah knows those who belong to him, and: Let everyone naming the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.    2 a: to impose a task or responsibility on  b: to command, instruct, or exhort with authority  cof a judge : to give a charge to (a jury)    This is one of the definitions of charging. He is putting the responsibility upon us to listen to the things of God. We see how the talk of these two babblers could hurt the congregation. If any one congregation that says things that do not agree with God's word do not pay attention. We can see what that can do to the congregation when we see the word gangrene used.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Repeat these basic essentials about the word of God. Warn God's people about nitpicking. Warn them before God.Make them well aware of the plan of God. Nitpicking chips away at the faith. (We often find fault in a petty manner! It is not about us.It is about his word.) It just wears everyone out. Concentrate on doing your best for God,work you will not be ashamed of,laying out the truth plain and simple. Stay clear of pious talk that is only talk.Words are not mere words you know. If they are not backed by a godly life,they accumulate as poison to the soul. Ignorance of the word of God shows by our actions. So we can cause others to stray from the house of God.|`|eJMAbtfXaa	The truths which have been revealed to you via the Holy Ghost.

Not truth seekers.  4. 15%, they read about Islam for the sake of finding out the truth about it, but they don't take the means of understanding it.

Just be wary and meet in a public place and maybe bring a friend (just common sense). I had a buyer stop by my house to pick an item up unannounced and it kinda freaked me out.    Another thought would be instead of a cash transaction in person, to go ahead and pay the item cost through paypal (if you have that option) minus the shipping of course.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	You should not do this because you won't be protected by eBay if something goes wrong with the product you're purchasing or if he/she claims that you didn't pay them.

FhHklqkhaa	sadly it sounds like an accurate depiction of heaven    God's only defined as good because people claim he is|`|9btru19waa	You don't know God.|`|gqhoCu3faa	THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.

Matthew 6:9    Some of the responsibilities that Christ will direct is as follows:    (Isa 11:3-5) .?.?.And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. 4?And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth. And he must strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the spirit of his lips he will put the wicked one to death. 5?And righteousness must prove to be the belt of his hips, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.    (Ps 37:11) .?.?.But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.    (Re 21:3-4) 3?With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. 4?And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.    When Christ was on the earth he demonstrated his power over death by resurrecting , healing debilatating  illness, blindness, deafness , etc.     (Joh 5:28-29) 28?Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice 29?and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life.?.?.    --There is much more to be done from heaven for the earth in greater magnitude than what Christ demonstrated , while on earth!  --Can we not  imagine what it would be like to have a ruler as Christ, from heaven, taking care of all earthly needs & much more?|`|CLB32006aa	They are just afraid of punishment, so they sacrifice their logic and free will for a feeling of security.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Heaven on earth will be great when God is in control of the situation.

uD1UFdRsaa	Sounds sweet but cliche, which doesn't mean it's a bad thing. I;m sure she'll like it very much- but you gotta wonder if it's a bit predictable what events will come up next after another.

nXBPXVnkaa	No need to yell.    I like the city life and went to school in CA and NYC. There is no single definition of an "American Lifestyle." Pick the school based on the best programs for your major, financial considerations, your lifestyle, etc.    Ohio and Mississippi = southern  Michigan = midwest  New York = east coast|`|nisfxpXHaa	Ohio is right under Michigan. How southern can it be if Michigan is mid-western.    I agree though that your choice should be based on the school programs offered.    Springfield OH population just over 60,000 mostly industrial/blue color  Plattsburgh NY population just over 18,000 looks beautiful though.  University of Mississippi in Oxford Mississippi population just over 11,000  Hope college in Holland MI population just over 34,000 Small town appeal, Lake Michigan and Macatawa.    Hard choices to make. Of them all Springfield does appear to be the least appealing. But again look into the universities first.      L|`|5RH9Osdsaa	I don't think there is a "truly American lifestyle", because we are all so diverse.  You will probably get a very different perspective depending upon which of these schools you go to.  I would pick whichever one has the best program and then use downtime to travel and see how we live in different parts of the country.  In some cases, it is like night and day.    That said, I am a buckeye (Ohio resident), so I think Wittenberg would be a great choice ;-).  Good luck in your decision.|`|kjWqxBPXaa	Come to California instead its nicer !!! xxsamxx

Now though if you say 'I'm gay' people wouldn't really think you are saying you are happy, it isn't used much in the happy way anymore since it's more popular with the homosexual meaning.  If I say it though I mean it in both ways.|`|7b146a60b32cbb99ede1f7f2407168d2aa	You know what it means!    It means turnip casserole of course! ;)|`|aDXsUPYRaa	That means  Gay people are happy  LOL  just trying to be funny|`|q9sEy6LCaa	will your right about that gay mean being happy so listen a then on the other hand being gay also mean 2 of the same "SEX"(the same kind of gender)being interment with one anther...|`|B7UIP9QYaa	Gay means joyful and happy. The joy is generally characterized by colors like in Carnivals, Fireworks, Arts ... etc. Homosexuals are generally joyful, colorful and happy and that's when the sense of the word Gay has been extended to define our community.  Gay is a nice word to describe us and definitely better than homosexuals that just revels our way of living to a sordid same sex issue while there is a true Gay culture, Gay life and Gay love.    Cheers.

Just curious..    If it bothers you then just don't say anything. Let them talk|`|O7SshRl6aa	You don't really need to say anything.  If someone asks you about something related to alcohol, just say you don't drink and don't know the answer.|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	Sigh - a teetotaler is someone who doesn't drink.  For those of you that don't know, you could have pretty easily taken that from context.      Anyway, you should probably not say anything and avoid situations where that is the topic of conversation.|`|TPVvddHWaa	Why are you tee total? If it is because you are an alcoholic or do not drink for religious purposes, then you may want to say exactly that. It is not rude at all.    I have friends who do not drink because they simply do not like the taste and would rather have something else to drink.     They simply say, I would rather have a nice cup of tea, no one bothers. Why would it be rude to say that?    There is no need to feel guilty about not drinking.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I've been sober 24 years.  I owned sober living houses for over 20 years, and I've never, not once had a problem.  If your friends have such limited interests that  they just LOVE to talk about drinking, then you are in the wrong group.  Find other friends.  If it's occasionally conversations about wines, or liquors, or even the foam on a mug of beer, what's it going to hurt you to sit there and listen.  You might learn something that would be interesting knowledge in some other conversation.    I suggest, when you have an opportunity, after they have milked the liquor issue for a while, bring up some other interesting thing to talk about.  You certainly should not  try to stop them from talking about drinking if that's what this group of people want to talk about!  LOL  Sounds like you could benefit from some volunteer work at a community center, or hospital or church and meet some more people.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Show some interest and make a small conversation of it, like, Well I've never tried that before? How does it taste like? Which is sweeter and lighter etc? You can never go wrong with it. Of course, there's nothing with not saying anything at all.|`|rThIVk2maa	Then don't say anything :) I would personally try to find other topics that aren't so dead boring or find people to talk to that have more interesting things to say and more in common with me.|`|Ym90xu59aa	Yes. If people want to drink, or talk about drinking, so be it. If you don't like it then you should find other people to talk to.|`|eceLQUj5aa	hahaha based on a lot of peoples answers you should have put the definition of teetotaling in your question.    look your decision to remain abstinent from alcohol has other things that come with it. One of which is having to listen to people who are of a certain age group talking about drinking. I know you dont drink but it may be fun to go out with them if you don't already. Go have some sodas and share in the fun, then you would have stories to share along with them.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	What would you do if people are talking about football, and you don't like the sport? Find another conversation.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Just tell them that you have no opinion on the subject as you don't imbibe. That should confuse them enough to change the subject for a while.|`|2b653b3adf15b210819908f23d249cc1aa	I haven't drunk ANYTHING since September, and it has NOTHING to do with religious, moral, or ethical reasons.      My doctor put me on the drug Soriatane, and you can consume NO alcohol while taking the drug, it's THAT potent.  If you consume ANY alcohol for 2 months prior to taking or 2 months AFTER taking the drug, you can't consume ANY alcohol, even cough medicine.    How did I handle it??  I TOLD people, and they understood, TRUE friends will understand whatever reason that you quit drinking.      If they don't, those AREN'T people that you need to be hanging with, buddy......Best to you.    BTW, after almost 6 months w/o alcohol, I've lost (magically!!!) 18 pounds, and look and feel MUCH better.......      Christopher K.|`|XwacWyy6aa	Start drinking.|`|S8pIwxpwaa	You could work into the conversation that you don't drink, but you should also make clear that you don't find talk about drinking particularly offensive.

The thing was, she died in 1967 and this happened in 1995. I was only born in 1980, but we had many pictures of her up. She was younger than when she had passed. I was honestly so confused that I didn't have to time be scared or anything. I ran to tell my mom and by the time we got back, she was gone. My mom said she also had seen her every once in awhile. Go figure.|`|98e6c57947232a9e251000c4a4583035aa	Dude there was a boy with overalls in my garage one time, I screamed and slammed the door then my brother opened the door and was like "theres no one out there!"|`|wX5xoAN8aa	I actually just saw the ghost of my half-eaten sandwich pass by.. >.>

Hateful is probably again like to feeling threatened or angered.|`|qIPpBauHaa	It's a natural response. Your body senses that you're getting stressed. This causes adrenaline to enter your system, amplify your muscles and brain. It's from being like cavemen. Fight for get the hell out of there. Helps in the running away so that you can get away fast and have the mental clarity to avoid stuff. Or fighting the threat that's facing ya. It's all natural.
k03dYskYaa	How is he close-minded?  If you are referring to the God of the Bible, it is very open-minded to set and have standards.

He is our creator. He is not closed minded, but is watching us to see what we do with the life he has given us. He gave free will to all. Peace|`|8pQrIL90aa	Very good question.    If you are GOD, know all and see all, yet your creations claims to be wiser and smarter than you, what would you do? Jesus is a great example of trusting GOD! He did what GOD told him and now he has the best job that a son could have!    God is GOD. He cannot change, so he sent his son for mankind. He is who he is, yet even then he sent someone to save us without having to change his true nature. Wouldn't be much of a GOD if he were fickle minded would he?|`|PKULDaC7aa	He's selfish.|`|HG5Smxkjaa	Closed minded about what?|`|xNaN3VkJaa	God is truth. Whatever is not truth is false and therefore not of God.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	It's not the god, it's the people.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Sad to say....God is open minded...it's those who don't believe that is close minded. God is open to us anytime, anyday, anynight, anywhere|`|JKKpwmBFaa	God can't be open-minded because the ability to think anything he wishes would deny him the ability to think all things at once. On the other hand, if he is closed-minded he would also be limited. Trying to understand god is like trying to sift through a tangled mess of contradictions. It is meaningless.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God or Jesus. The Bible is fiction. Some people are just too stupid to realize that.|`|dmCAiuMGaa	Why do you label Him closed-minded, just because *you* don't like His laws or agree with His morals?  You can call Him whatever you want, but the bottom line is His laws are what we are to obey.  It's your choice whether to follow Him or not.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	closed minded people invent closed minded gods|`|MUcINsQ3aa	Since mankind invented him, then he obviously has mankind's attributes|`|8n2NO6UVaa	So people wont sin.|`|cKuppxUQaa	What makes you think He is closed minded?|`|9btru19waa	God has an infinite mind. Only puny humans have closed finite minds if they so choose.|`|QWUJiAxQaa	"I am the truth."    "I am the light."    "I am the best."    "I am the greatest."    "You humans are sinners."    "But I'm absolutely perfect because I made you."    Kind of sounds like a boxer to me.      Those who regard a freedom from the chains of either religion  or the false moralities of sex as debauched are doing naught   but corrupting their minds with foolishness.      So cast ignorance into the hells of creed and learn of the   world with me. Knowledge has many gifts, one such being   a better way of life.   |`|AA10014750	Perhaps what God says, and what man says God says are different presently; especially in USA.|`|kWB3zRJBaa	He's not.

Abraham Lincoln, admittedly a great man, and he whole heartily rejected the belief that some men are only fit to be slaves(a belief that had proponents such as Aristotle), to the point he committed his country to war.    Hope that helps.|`|sV4knlUfaa	Wasn't Muhammad Ali the greatest?|`|IPj3GRoxaa	GOD is no-where near close minded. He has a plan for all of our lives. But just because He has a plan doesn't mean that we follow it. Think of it this way just because you have a plan to go somewhere today doesn't mean your definitely going to go there. What happens if something comes up and you cant go or something like that. Well GOD has a plan for all of our lives and yet we have choices he gives us a chance to make the right decision but if we don't we aren't going along with HIS plan therefore it seems to US that HE is the one being closed minded BUT really its us. We're not following HIS instruction. So that we know what exactly HIS instruction is for our lives!|`|AA10166652	Just because God doesn't do things the way people think He should, does not mean He is closed-minded.    Some of God's attributes are......    Wisdom: Wisdom is the ability to devise perfect ends and to achieve these ends by the most perfect means. In other words, God makes no mistakes. He is the Father who truly knows best, as Paul explains in Romans 11:33: Oh, how great are Gods riches and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to understand His decisions and His ways!     Sovereignty: This is the attribute by which He rules His entire creation. It is the application of His other attributes of being all-knowing and all-powerful. It makes Him absolutely free to do what He knows to be best. God is in control of everything that happens. Man still has a free will, and is responsible for his choices in life.     Holiness: This is the attribute that sets God apart from all other created beings. It refers to His majesty and His perfect moral purity. There is absolutely no sin or evil thought in God at all. His holiness is the definition of that which is pure and righteous in all the universe. Wherever God has appeared, such as to Moses at the burning bush, that place becomes holy just for God having been there.     Faithfulness: Everything that God has promised will come to pass. His faithfulness guarantees this fact. He does not lie. What He has said in the Bible about Himself is true. Jesus even said that He is the Truth. This is extremely important for the followers of Jesus because it is on His faithfulness that our hope of eternal life rests. He will honor His promise that our sins will be forgiven and that we will live forever with Him.     Love: Love is such an important part of Gods character that the apostle John wrote, God is love. This means that God holds the well-being of others as His primary concern. For a full definition of love, read 1 Corinthians 13. To see love in action, study the life of Jesus. His sacrifice on the cross for the sins of others is the ultimate act of love. Gods love is not a love of emotion but of action. His love gives freely to the object of its affection, those who choose to follow His son Jesus.     Goodness: The goodness of God is that which disposes Him to be kind, cordial, benevolent, and full of good will toward men. This attribute of God is why He bestows all the blessing He does on His followers. Gods actions define what goodness is, and we can easily see it in the way Jesus related to the people around Him.         ?|`|6BhTjwoNaa	If you really knew Him, you wouldnt say it.Just because a person doesnt believe in something it doesnt make it any less or negate it.|`|ejbSFv0caa	If you 'know' that electricity kills if you abuse it - would you abuse it?    Nope on that issue you would exhibit a firmly closed mind and apply you're knowledge for satiety's sake    So why would you expect God to have an open mind when He knows the answers?|`|02e9a929bbbabec277d3bf8e5b314504aa	Please elaborate|`|ueP6VXevaa	Says who?

There's more to God than you can ever imagine.  Trying to decipher is physical form and denying His existence because you can't is childish.

We want you to have only the very best experience from your recent purchase of Pagan Religion v. 5.3, and we are confident that, now we have addressed the main issues with 5.2,  you should experience no difficulty whatsoever.    You say that your house was struck by lightning and burnt down. Could you please identify the lightning concerned. Was it 'Forked, v. 3a', or possible 'Ball FMP4'. If either of these, you may need to update your chalice. Please see our downloads section for the appropriate codec.    Finally, can you clarify the colour of the fire. If it was green, then please rest assured, this is perfectly normal. Try reading the new users' manual on fireproofing your home against green fire. If it was pink, you may have not fully uninstalled a previous version of Pagan Religion, in which case you are truly stuffed, and we are sorry. ;)    If you can give us the relevant information, as well as full schematic drawings for the structure of the house and a complete inventory of all its contents (not including family members, visitors, pets, houseplants) etc. (see section 113 paragraph 98 of the Terms and Conditions chapter of your original purchase records) ... well then will be happy to consider replacing them for you on a no liability or goodwill basis.    Please note that if you intend to repeat the ritual, a new goat will be required.

AA11207604	thats a very good question|`|AA11849917	TRUE religion, undefiled (according to the Bible) is to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the homeless, bring comfort to those who mourn, forgive those who offend you, and treat others the way you want to be breated.  (This was gleamed from several passages, not just one verse).    So, if you think God's kind of religion is bad like war, then I hope and pray that one day YOU need someone to show a little kindness and "religion" to YOU!  I really do hope that you lose your house, your home, your clothes, your job, your food, and everything else.  You need a little humbling!  Religion is GOOD!  If you think it's bad, then you deserve to not have any!      Yes, I'm extremely irritated right now.  I'm fed up with arrogant, presumptuous "know-it-alls" who think the universe revolves around them, and that reality can bend to their own will!    If a flea says of the camel whose back it dwells, that camels don't exist, that's foolish.    If a grain of sand in the Sahara Desert says that the desert doesn't exist, that's a bigger fool!    If an electron says that the cosmos doesn't exist, that's yet an even bigger fool!    And if a mere finite, mortal person says that God doesn't exist, that's infinte folly!    You say God doesn't exist.  Actually YOU don't exist, when compared to God!  You are smaller than the atom next to the entire cosmos, when compared to God!    So get off your "high horse", and get rid of that super ego of yours, thinking that YOU can command the way reality and the universe exists!    Infinite folly!  That's the way I see it!

Then do what you want. Gays talk... unless you find one that is closeted like you, but trust me,,, it WILL eventually get out! Do yourself a favor, you are so close to leaving home,,, play it straight for now,,|`|tL5YbnWjaa	It's not easy. I used to go out to gay clubs when I was young; but now I don't like to stay out into the wee hours of the morning; I don't like breathing cigarette smoke in the bars either. When I meet a guy I like I try to develop a friendship and see if anything develops. It is a little scary when I finally tell him that I am gay. No one has ever cut me out of their life or blabbed to my entire social circle; there have been several occasions the guy has said that it's cool but he's straight and later we got together.

But during the witch hunts, a total of no more than 100,000 were burned at the stake.  And that's throughout Europe.    Before that, historians can only speculate.      There have been a few hundred or so executed in Nigeria for "witchcraft", but not all of them were women.  This is actually going on right now.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Somewhere in the thousands.

They didn't keep any records in medieval times or way back in the Dark Ages.    The witch-burnings actually began in the time of ancient Rome, when the Empire was forcibly converted to Christianity. Pagan priests, priestesses and philosophers were accused of witchcraft by the mob.|`|YfwgvPaCaa	The exact number will never be known. Many people of every culture has had some type of "religious cleansing" - "witch hunts" since the earliest history recorded by the Chinese and Egyptians. Out of fear, ignorance, greed and ego, thousands, possibly millions have been burned, mutilated, tortured, or killed using religious beliefs as their reasonings. Even in the early stages of Christianity, self proclaimed Christians were done the same way during Ceasar Neros reign. He felt it a threat to his own self proclaimed belief of being a God appointed by Zeus.  The Inquisistion was similar and it spread through Europe like wildfire. The archbishop of the roman papacy declared that the devil was rampant throughout the land and the people were leaving the church in droves and not paying homage to God. This is when the Roman Monarchy started withdrawing much of their monatary and land transfers to the church. They also refused to pay for their soldiers and staff. At this time, new science, astronomy knowledge, and new engineering feats using new mathmatics was becoming very popular. With people not coming to the church, paying tithes, or leaving donations as they used to, the Church itself felt it was losing it's foot hold on the people and it's monarchy. To increase conversion and maintain it's position, the archbishop at the time declared that due to "Gods' plagues upon the world" it was evident that HE had turned his back on them and the reason was due to demons and witchcraft in their communities. To make sure that these so called "demon possessed and witches" were brought to be "cleansed" or destroyed and that "good Christians" were rewarded here as well as in Heaven, payment after proof, would be given. If the person died then a portion of the property would be divided with the accuser and the church. The churches portion would be as an offering to God for smiling upon them for finding them. It actually got to the point that the church and the citizens got greedy and egotistical with piousy, that many small towns, villages, and whole family lineages were wiped out. When it started to slow down and people cowered under the Churches rulings, the farther the Inquisition reached, even to the settlements of early America. In the early years of the inquisitions, most tortures and deaths were done in dungeons and private areas. Later, to prove that these people were truly being "inquisitioned" as well as using them as examples to the rest of the community that if you do not follow the rules of God and Rule, this will happen to you!  Don't get me wrong, many were still done in private. Especially women. Not out of propriety mind you, but out of sadistic or lustful reasons. Even Galileo and other scientists, inventors, and alchemists of his time were put to the inquisition and died from it's detailed investigations. To say exactly who died at the stake for witchcraft would be hard to say for the mere fact that some small monastaries and kirks took it upon themselves to do the same. You may want to search under  Inquisition (it was not only in Spain but all over Europe)  Ethnic cleansing  Genocide (it was not only the Jews and it is still happening in Asia and Africa).    http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...  http://www.exposingchristianity.com/Inqu...  http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/in...  And here is some of the tools they used.....  http://www.medievality.com/torture.html  Thousands of innocent people died by human hands who considered their beliefs to be absolute and perfect and would even preach love, tolerance, and peace. But what they did behind closed doors would definitly suprise you. Probably very few "true" witches were burned or killed by the result, but even just a few is a few too many.|`|O9WVH9yhaa	I'm not sure of an exact number, but there were other ways of doing it too...    Like throwing them in a river.  If she didn't drown then they knew she was a witch and then burned her at the stake.    If she did drown then they knew she was not a witch.    Either way she was doomed.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	It isn't known, but many like to exaggerate the numbers|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	difficult to say as there wasn't much evidence left|`|xLKPKgZXaa	I have no idea of the figure but it was a lot and children were burned for the same reason.

There are a few changes in vocabulary or accent, but is the same, you can understand everything.    I don't think the clearly spanish is from Arg or Chile, you can find that according to several studies, in Colombia they speak a very good spanish, mostly without an accent (although not having an accent, for me, is having one).    It's not true either that in LA we use slang, off course in Spain they do.    So, my opinion is, you can understand everything if doesn't matter where are you from, and also, to learn a clean spanish, go to colombia... or hear a colombian person.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	They're similar, but not exactly the same.|`|4pqu1SWAaa	They pronunciation is different.

For instance    Spain    Yo bebo  T bebes/ Usted bebe  l/ Ella  bebe  Nosotros bebemos  Vosotros bebis/ Ustedes beben  Ellos beben    Mxico  Yo bebo  T bebes/ Usted bebe  l/ Ella  bebe  Nosotros bebemos   Ustedes beben  Ellos beben    And the vocabulary sometimes changes a bit.  But don't worry.  We understand perfectly each other.|`|XJGSjDSHaa	No.  Castillan Spanish is about as different from western hemispheric Spanish as American English is from British.  Castillan also has a "lisp" to it that the other Spanish dialects do not have.    The most "clean" Spanish is from Chile or Argentina.   Mexican is different from all other Spanishes because of it's heavy Aztec influences and lack of African influences like you might find in Carribean Spanishes or South American Spanishes.      Peruvian is also highly dialectic because of the indigenous influences.

aa4de9b3ec59bb8460ddd7367ffa1afcaa	Once the meal has begun, you are within your rights as a guest to arrange your tableware as you need so long as your modified arrangement does not interfere with others' table space or the passing of dishes.  The important thing is not to suggest by your rearrangement that the hostess was somehow inconsiderate in failing to arrange your tableware to your liking, which just means it's a good idea to be subtle about it.      Etiquette is about minding the comfort of others, basically.  Sitting down and making a decided set of changes before you begin eating would draw attention and potentially make your host feel you were insinuating something about her table arrangement.  A better way to handle it would be to pick up your glass with your left hand when you first drink from it, then set it down in a more convenient place when you're finished.  Likewise, a subtle transfer of silverware from one hand to the other would be preferable to rearranging the table setting all at once.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	Yea go lefties  No its not  its perfectly fine  adjust for yourself you don't have to deal with even bigger messes|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	Do you go to that many formal dinners where this is a problem?

It's clumsy, it's awkward, I'm slow at it, but I figure I'm not offending my host so that's more important than my comfort.|`|AA12361841	I guess it would depend on who the host/hostess is.

However, there are times when we need to go with the flow - especially when we're guests.    You should leave the table settings as they were placed. After taking a sip of your drink, you could quietly say to your neighbor on your left "do you mind if I place my glass over here? I'm left-handed and things can get a little messy if I leave it on the other side." This shows consideration for your seat mate and that you realize you are going against the accepted "flow" of formal table etiquette.|`|3becff333a551f4097226dfe2aae0006aa	One you start eating, you can place your utensils wherever you like.

I am right handed, but use my cutlery with opposite hands. I think that, as long as your cup and side dishes don't intrude upon your neighbours' space, it should be fine for you to move them. If someone looks at you or comments, just quietly mention that you are left handed and that moving the settings makes dining much more convenient.  Just make sure you move things subtly (for example, pick up the cup, then drink, then put it down where you want it), and you should be fine.  Hope this helps!  =)|`|S8pIwxpwaa	I am left handed; but have learned to deal with a formal place setting by reaching for my water glass with my right hand.    Left handers like you & I are notoriously "different thinkers". In this case, the different thinking involves adapting ourselves to the situation; not vice versa.    Best of luck!    EDIT: Javinia's answer below is perfect. Kudos!|`|MEV7M65Xaa	When you change the table settings you disrupt the entire table. These utensils are in each place for a specific reason. When you change your settings then everyone else must do so also because u have taken up their space.  Just a quick note...........formal table settings were set because Queen Elizabeth I was left handed.  Hence the fork is to the left of the plate.  Hostesses and those who set these settings up work hard to make them pleasing and correct.  Please respect this.  There is one time when I doubt anyone would object that is if you are dining in a fine restaurant and have only one person to a side of the table...........However, if the table is small still be careful that you are not encroaching on another persons area.

They do not "burn in Hell forever" because of the fact that "the wages of sin is DEATH" - not "eternal life in Hellfire". The wicked receive no eternal life of any kind, in Hell or otherwise. They will be permanently destroyed.|`|XiITTg3waa	GOOD PEOPLE GO TO HELL CAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CHRIST !!

I HOPE THIS HELPS !!|`|KT7cllsLaa	People dont go to Hell  period|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus without adding any of your own works.     We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior without adding any of your own works, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Yes, good people go to hell.

There is nothing you can do to earn your salvation and if you haven't believed you will go to hell. This doesn't mean you should do whatever you want and not try to be "good" but that isn't required for salvation. Also, there isn't really anyone that is totally "good". Everyone has sinned and come short of the glory of God. Therefore, the only way is by believing.|`|OB3BxHCOaa	There is only "hell" for mormons, adventists, baptists, methodists and so on...the list is large and would take a lot of space, I don't want to be greedy because I might go to "hell" with them...NOOOOOOOOOOO!|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Would your father condemn you to an eternity of pain and suffering? God is your father too. He loves you unconditionally. Don't forget that he made you with human frailties. All He wants is for you to be happy and well.

The Bible says that sin is a heart condition. It is a condition of rebellion against God, which stems from pride. The Bible even refers to pride as "original sin." The Hebrew definition of the word sin means "to miss the mark." God created us to be like Him, but our pride and rebellion make us fall far short of that purpose. Our actions, though they may be "sinful" are really only the fruit of our rebellion against God. Our outward actions merely mirror our true inner condition. It is our true inner condition that God is concerned with. He knows the "real you" better than you yourself do, because he sees "the inner man" and all your secret thoughts and motives.     Though one may lead a "good life" on the outside, God looks on the heart. It is the nature of man to look on the outward, but outward appearances can be deceiving.     We all need a new life. We need to be cleansed from sin and it's penalty (which is death) and restored to fellowship with God who made us all. That is what Jesus Christ (God's Son) meant when He said we "must be born again" (John 3:7). "...Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). Without the experience of the "new birth" we have no hope of enjoying the glories of heaven nor escaping the terrors of hell. Have you been born again?    The "new birth" is not a religion, not living up to a creed, not a set of rituals, nor joining a church or denomination. It's a transformation. Our old nature is changed and we receive a new one. Old things pass away and all things become new in Christ. We receive a new heart, new desires, new ideas, and a new direction because of this new nature. A birth is the coming into being of a new life which has the nature of its parents. When you were born the first time, you were made a partaker of the nature of natural man. When you are born again, you become a partaker of the divine nature (II Peter 1:4). God can become your heavenly Father.    "The Lord is...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance" (II Peter 3:9)|`|wT9PTRgtaa	once you have heard gospel and reject it you are on your way to hell.for all those who died without hearing gospel will be resurrected on a future date and given option to choose or reject messiah.this isthe essence of israelite festival of last great day which god cammanded israel to observe forever.|`|AA10063342	Being good is not enough, salvation in Christ is your key to heaven.|`|XDRRg5o4aa	if it's true than the christian God is an angry and vengeful god that never forgave humans for crucifying his son.|`|gf5ysBCnaa	Good people don't exist we are all seedy sinners.|`|JMOLRKRraa	It is God's creation, He can do whatever He wants with it.   Be grateful He decided you would accept Him, He created you for all eternity. Jesus doesn't want any to perish. Jesus suffers with each loss, you can see it in the gospels if you are sensitive to it. But Jesus holds back, and acknowledges no one comes to Him, Jesus, unles God sends them to Him. Jesus is very obediant to Father God, and ackowledges the Father's will in all things.  There is an exception to the born again rule, to escape hell, in Book of Revelation.

He doesn't want a person to be the one standing in church showing others what a good Christian s/he is by being on every committee so people can say "What a fine person X is.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.

Try reconciling that verse and others with the {FALSE} doctrine of Hellfire.    Contrary to popular belief, hell is not a place of eternal torment. The Greek word Haides from which we get hell, and it's Hebrew equivalent sheohl, refers to the common grave of mankind; the patriarch Job prayed "O that you would hide me in sheol {hell}"[Job 14:13 Amplified Bible], meaning that he wanted a quick and painless death to end his suffering. Think about it; would you punish a child for some misdemeanor by holding his or her hand over a hot stove? the doctrine of Hellfire is a repugnant affront to a God of love.
AA11849917	There's no reason why they shouldn't.  They have never disobeyed God, denied God, put their fist (proverbially speaking) up to God, nor challenged God's existence!  They have done nothing whatsoever worthy of hell!

Anyone who has lived with, known or loved an animal well knows it thinks, feels, breathes, etc. The thing that makes us live is our soul - our life force energy. If it's breathing, it has a soul. Without the soul, you die.     All the animals I have known and loved and lived with were intelligent, they had emotions, they had thoughts, they were a part of our family.    As far as the bible saying animals have no souls, that is complete BS. The bible also says you should stone your children to death if they disobey you!

Also note that they all just left..and Jesus and the woman were left there alone.  Then note that Jesus response was "..go and sin no more"  That is symbolic of the way God deals with our sins today.  We ask for forgiveness and he forgives.  Our sin is cast into His sea of forgetfullness never to be remembered no more.." so what right does any man on earth have to hold your mistakes against you for ever (as most do)  Jesus taught a lesson with all things He did on earth.  That is a lesson to those who think they are more spiritual than you to be careful.  I cannot hold your crimes out for the public to see once God has forgiven them.  People who do that are considered back bitters and gossips in the scripture and they are categorized with murderers, and all types of the worst kind.  180 degree turn around from your sin is proof you are truly sorrowful for what you have done.  You just don't keep doing it time after time and consider it an error.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Sometimes, there just aren't enough rocks.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Duck|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i agree with you 100% to bad not enough of us christans read the bible now a days|`|7sEFufRbaa	I would love to say me, however, many sins.|`|67EaIAvbaa	tell em rev!!..GOD BLESS.|`|macZI2dzaa	Jesus stated that while He was present.

They remain single in order to devote more time to the ministry.  The point is to say that their ultimate commitment is to God and not to other things.  They do not have the distractions of marriage, etc, that many people do.  This doesn't mean that people are not allowed to have children or get married.  God said, "Be fruitful and multiply" so it is perfectly fine, so long as you are married.|`|36cf99f688a20dcf03d40a15a8f1c77caa	I don't know where Jesus talks about celibacy, nor do I know where he talks about purgatory, for that matter.

[His] disciples said to him, "If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."     He answered, "Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it."|`|jnG8sOzWaa	he doesn't, & that's one of the reasons why priests screw little boys|`|H7L66ynJaa	This is taken from Jesus' actions not statements.

Why in South America, some nail themselves to crosses.  All believe by some personal pain, they make themselves closer to God.  Despite nothing the Bible ever said admiring this attitude.    What Jesus did followed the entire thoughts of the Bible, his Father's thoughts.  Sex should only be a part of the marriage arrangement, instituted by God with Adam & Eve.    Jesus was not married as when he sacrificed his perfect body as a Ransom Sacrifice, it remained without any blemish.  The full potential for family and children in order to take the place of Adam for the entire human race.  If he had not been celibate, that would not have been possible.    A minor second point, he only had 3 and 1/2 years to get everything done.  Jesus just did not have the time.    Priests do not follow Jesus' example in anything else so why should we expect them to follow the Christ in this?    When Paul spoke of singleness, he talked about it as a better chance for God's service.  Not that it was a requirement.  Married people with families also serve God and He is just as pleased with them.  But family people have responsibilities they must keep other than personal service in the ministry.  That is a requirement for those seeking responsibility in the congregation in 1 Timothy chapter 3.  There it lists the qualities of those men.  Taking good care of their families covers a good deal of that chapter.|`|8pQrIL90aa	very good question. It is not necessary to do this. Why are men made to submit to this requirement is beyond me. But it does say that a man and a woman should come apart so that they may remain strong in theri faith to GOD, and not let themselves be taken our by fleshy, human desires.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Is this what you are talking about?    Not only do the Christian Greek Scriptures by precept and example make provision for marriage by Christian ministers, but they indicate that one of the signs of apostasy is forbidding to marry: The Spirit distinctly says that in later times some will turn away from the faith and will heed deceitful spirits and things taught by demons through plausible liarsmen with seared consciences who forbid marriage.1?Timothy 4:1-3.    Some people feel that celibacy must have originated with Jesus Christ or his apostles. So they are surprised to read statements such as that of former Pope John XXIII, who said:    Ecclesiastical celibacy is not a dogma. The Scriptures do not impose it. It is even easy to effect a change. I take a pen, I sign a decree and, the next day, priests who wish to may get married. But I cannot.    Why not? One of several reasons is that it is such a deep-rooted Church tradition. The first Church council forbidding marriage for the higher clergy was held at Elvira, Spain, in the fourth century. Over the centuries, other decrees reinforced this. Then, during the period of the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, the Council of Trent passed legislation enforcing celibacy. It has remained much the same up to the present time.    Thus, celibacy has been acquired by tradition. As former high-ranking Catholic theologian Charles Davis said:    The taboo was not Christian in origin; it is a very ancient one in the history of religion. Its introduction into Christianity was part of the general shift toward paganism .?.?.    The insistence upon celibacy was reinforced in the Middle Ages by concern to keep Church property from passing under secular control.    No, neither Jesus nor his apostles required celibacy among Gods servants. While they showed that a single person would have more freedom to serve God, they did not lay down a law of celibacy.Matthew 19:11, 12; 1?Corinthians 7:32-38.    How was childbearing viewed among the early Christians? First it should be noted that Jesus did away with polygamy and concubinage among his disciples. He reestablished Jehovah Gods original standard, namely monogamy, or marriage of one man to one woman. (Matthew 19:4-9) Whereas fleshly Israel became populous through childbearing, spiritual Israel was to grow through disciple making.Matthew 28:19,?20; Acts 1:8.    If the expansion of Christianity was to come about mainly by childbearing, Jesus would not have encouraged his disciples to make room for singleness on account of the kingdom of the heavens. (Matthew 19:10-12) The apostle Paul would not have written: He also that gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that does not give it in marriage will do better.1?Corinthians 7:38.    However, while encouraging celibacy for the sake of supporting Kingdom interests, neither Jesus nor Paul imposed it. Both foresaw that some Christians would marry. Naturally, some of these would have children as a matter of course. The Christian Greek Scriptures contain several passages that gave the early Christians direct counsel on the upbringing of children. (Ephesians 6:1-4; Colossians 3:20,?21) If elders or ministerial servants were married, they were to be exemplary parents.1?Timothy 3:4,?12.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	1Co 7:27  Do you have a wife? Don't seek a divorce. Are you divorced from your wife? Don't look for another one.   1Co 7:28  But if you do get married, you have not sinned. If a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will have trouble, and I would like to spare them from that.   1Co 7:29  This is what I mean, brothers and sisters: The time has been shortened. While it lasts, those who are married should live as though they were not.   1Co 7:30  Those who have eyes filled with tears should live as though they have no sorrow. Those who are happy should live as though there was nothing to be happy about. Those who buy something should live as though they didn't own it.   1Co 7:31  Those who use the things in this world should do so but not depend on them. It is clear that this world in its present form is passing away.   1Co 7:32  So I don't want you to have any concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord.   1Co 7:33  But the married man is concerned about earthly things, that is, about how he can please his wife.   1Co 7:34  His attention is divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the Lord's things so that she may be holy in body and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about earthly things, that is, about how she can please her husband.   1Co 7:35  I'm saying this for your benefit, not to restrict you. I'm showing you how to live a noble life of devotion to the Lord without being distracted by other things.     it is out of a desire to dedicate their bodies and life to God that they make that commitment, priesthood is voluntary.|`|gf5ysBCnaa	I didn't think he did.

He says:    Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so.    On account of some defect from birth, there are some who simply are unable to have marital relations. They remain, from birth, celibate. Secondly He says:    Some, because they were made so by others.    Jesus lived in the time of kings, and the king would often have servants whose entire work was to wait on the queen and serve her hand and foot. Naturally, he wanted to make sure that was all they did! Therefore, these servants would be made celibate. They called them eunuchs. But finally Jesus says:    Some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.    Celibate men and women are a sign of the Kingdom of God. They are a reminder to us that Gods plan for redemption and to make us His own forever begins here in this world, but that it doesnt end there. Celibacy is a signand right now, in the midst of the world we live in, a very loud and clear sign indeedof the eternal relationship and the heavenly calling we all share with God.      "For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	First, the word "Celibate" means "unwilling to get married" not "unwilling to have sex" which is what "abstinent" means.      So yes, every priest is, by dint of their preisthood, also celibate.  Whether or not they are abstinent is another issue.|`|AA10166652	1 Corinthians 6:15-18  Don't you know that your bodies are part of the body of Christ? Is it right for me to join part of the body of Christ to a prostitute? No, it isn't! Don't you know that a man who does that becomes part of her body? The Scriptures say, "The two of them will be like one person." But anyone who is joined to the Lord is one in spirit with him. Don't be immoral in matters of sex. That is a sin against your own body in a way that no other sin is.     ~~~~~~~~~    The reason so many people allow themselves to fall into this (or any) sin is because they do not keep their flesh under control.....they also do not ask God for a way out, when confronted by the temptation to sin.    ~~~~~~~~~    1 Corinthians 10:13 You are tempted in the same way that everyone else is tempted. But God can be trusted not to let you be tempted too much, and he will show you how to escape from your temptations.     James 1:13 Don't blame God when you are tempted! God cannot be tempted by evil, and he doesn't use evil to tempt others.           ?

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.

As any good thing can be misused, a word of warning may be appropriate. The scriptures dont have the answers to every question. Many important truths have yet to be revealed. Preoccupation with the so-called mysteries should be avoided. Beware also of private interpretation.     When we think of false prophets and false teachers, we tend to think of those who espouse an obviously false doctrine or presume to have authority to teach the true gospel of Christ according to their own interpretation. We often assume that such individuals are associated with small radical groups on the fringes of society. However, I reiterate: there are false prophets and false teachers who have or at least claim to have membership in the Church. There are those who, without authority, claim Church endorsement to their products and practices. Beware of such.|`|bFZBIVWNaa	I think that the most important thing is that your religious interpretation satisfies your own spiritual needs.  The bible can absolutely be interpreted that way, there are infinite ways of interpretation.  I personally don't interpret it that way, but that doesn't mean that you are wrong.  It just means we have different perspectives.|`|Ma10Exocaa	As long as you're not hurtin' anybody....go ahead.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	If you have doubts because of all these different denominations and the many different versions of the bible (most of which are not as different from each other as you might assume) then I suggest that you start studying Hebrew and Greek and learn to read those that are nearest to the original.  Decide for yourself, after comparing the Hebrew and Greek with all those other versions, how accurate the newer ones are and then you should be able to work out for yourself what you should believe.    Most denominations are not as different as you think they are either. The differences are so slight in MOST cases that any born-again Christian should be able to visit a different denominational church without being uncomfortable.  The churches to avoid are those that do not teach strictly from the bible.  There are some churches where a sermon means 'just a nice little story with a meaning but don't worry about mentioning God, Jesus or sin etc.' Those are the ones I never return to.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Isn't that the very reason why there are in fact 39,000 denominations?|`|c95d0302c2211652aacf54a2a7f7550caa	I think ur spot on.....the rest is window dressing.

Always let him lead you, and he will clear the road for you to follow.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	You are way off.  Are you a young person, because these kinds of ideas are hitting a lot of people in the churches and not just you, and they are especially appealing to the young people.  I know, I'm hearing about it regularly - it's called the Emerging Church.    Is it wrong?  Well, if your 'interpretation' differs from what the Bible teaches, yes, it is wrong.  You see, the Bible teaches us how to believe, how to walk the narrow way and how to get to heaven and if any of your 'interpretations' say other than what the Bible says in reference to these things, well, it could well affect your salvation.  So there's a lot at stake here.    The Lord Jesus warned about deception - false prophets and 'wolves in sheep's clothing' and suchlike - and he was talking about IN THE CHURCH not outside of it.  Even St. Paul warned that 'Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them' - Acts 20:30.    Firstly, I see you deny the existence of actual places called heaven and hell.  If there weren't such places, then why did the Lord Jesus tell us about them?  Beware of too much allegorising.  Why does the Bible warn us about going to hell as a result of God's judgment?  And, if we pray 'Our Father, which art in heaven' - well, according to your reasoning, our Father must therefore be in us.    Therefore 'getting to heaven' is the same thing as 'enlightenment' or 'self-awareness' - oh dear, you are far gone!  This is New Age stuff, which takes much of its credo from eastern religions - Buddhism and Hinduism.  Christianity has nothing to do with these religions - period.    Again, you say 'we're all the same person', like different waves in an ocean 'really part of one entity'.  I suppose you mean God is that 'entity'.  So, we're all in God.  Then that means that our God is not holy - for holy means separate (ie. not like us, entirely 'other').  Not only that, if we are all one, and all in God, then that is the philosophy of 'oneness' or monism - another eastern idea.  What have you been reading?    Not only that, if we are 'all one in God' already, then we are not estranged from God, as the gospel says, and so we do not need salvation.  All we need is to learn to be good, move on in love - that sort of thing.  And, of course, there would be no hell, because that's where sinners go that refuse God, but if we're already in God to start with, then there's no estrangement, and no sin, for we are as God is.    Hmm.  This is very New Age or, as they call it nowadays 'New Spirituality'.  It is not a new interpretation, as you call it (though there are those who call it that) - it is old, old gnosticism coming back - plain outside what Christianity truly is, in its very essence.    Thank God your church doesn't teach this, that's all I can say.  Why don't you go to your Pastor and have a good talk with him and let him explain it to you.  Because you really are 'in the danger zone' - no iffs and buts.  I repeat, you really do need to see your Pastor.    I will ask you again, what have you been reading?  Because you haven't thought all this up by yourself - stuff maybe by Brian McLaren, Rob Bell, Henri Nouwen, Thomas Merton, Tony Campolo, Ken Blanchard, Alan Jones, Tylden Edwards, Erwin McManus, Dan Kimball, Tony Jones, Leonard Sweet, Doug Pagit, Helen Schucman, Robert Schuller, Mark Yaconelli - the list is endless.  All part of the Emerging Church, whose ideas you seem to have picked up.      There are those among them who even deny the Atonement - that's where this kind of doctrine will lead you (and some) - right out of Christianity and into something else.    You seem to be asking a genuine question and I can understand how the young can be so affected by this sort of stuff - because it's just everywhere, in the Christian bookshops, in many churches, on the media, so it's easy to get confused.  And it's very appealing, just as though it's some kind of 'new thing'.  However, as I told you before, it's not new at all - it goes way back.  They're calling it 'ancient-future' in the churches now.      The only way to tell the difference is to study your Bible (not the way they tell you to do it, because they twist things) and test everything you read against the true faith which you have been taught. You know, the old-fashioned sort.  The sort that will, indeed, get you to heaven - not this super-spiritual stuff.    And learn to hear what the Holy Spirit is saying to you (not 'another spirit' - II Cor.11:4, talking about this very thing), because He will never contradict the Bible.  Because this is an unbiblical movement.  You need to discern who you are listening to.      Run a mile from this stuff, it's deadly dangerous to your faith.  If you've got the true faith now, stick with it, keep learning and reading your Bible, and don't in any way, shape or form, entertain this other stuff.  You will not 'miss out' - believe me!    You know, people that deny hell are usually going there|`|jsuySwTVaa	God makes individuals, not gangs.|`|XDRRg5o4aa	I agree with you, the teachings of the Bible were never meant to be taken literally and that is why the christian faith got so messed up.   It is not wrong to make your own interpertations...far from it, it is so right. Jesus Christ wanted his followers to think for themselves and the way some people interpert his teachings is a perversion of his real message.   I like to think of it this way, we are all the same thing just split into different perspectives. Like cells in our bodes that continue to divide; we all start as a single cell in the womb that starts dividing and dividing becoming more and more complex until it forms a person. It's like if you made a batch of cookies and cut the dough up into different shapes and sizes...it is still the same material but split into different things    thats a bad example but you get what I mean.|`|M7rdNZgVaa	I can not judge you and say you are wrong or right.  But the bible is for understanding -     check out this site and then tell me if you think heaven and hell are inside you or if there is that just place when we die.

GOD BLESS|`|dhs9QBMoaa	You mention 39000 denominations.  Have you ever explored Gnosticism?  It was pretty much buried by the "Catholic" church in the dark/middle ages, but it follows the general pattern of your beliefs.  Gnostics believed that there is a totality of God and everything He created, which they called the "Pleroma". This idea is similar to your notion of "different waves on the ocean".  Some Gnostic sects believed that human beings are in reality eternal souls (parts of the "Pleroma") trapped in an imperfect material existence.  Others taught that the true nature of God was inherent in all of us, which is similar to your statement about Jesus teaching that heaven and hell are within us.  I'm wondering if you've ever heard of the Nag Hammadi Library.  It is a collection of scriptures that were contemporary with the texts of the New Testament, but were banned by the "Catholic" church.  These texts were thought lost to the world (destroyed by the "Catholics"), but a collection was found in Egypt in 1945.  If you haven't already read these scriptures, you might want to pick them up and give them a look.  Look for a book called "The Nag Hammadi Library - The Definitive Translation Of The Gnostic Scriptures Complete In One Volume" by James M. Robinson.   Good luck and God bless.

AA11440601	Same thing as usual.    The Catholic Church has mellowed on this subject over the centuries as knowledge of mental illness and depression has increased.    Catholics believe suicide when committed in full knowledge and deliberate consent is a complete turning away from God (a mortal sin) and will send a person to hell.    There are 3 conditions of a mortal sin: grave matter, full knowledge, and deliberate consent.     While suicide (or any kind of murder) is always a grave matter, people who commit suicide may not always have full knowledge of what they're doing. Drugs can definitely impair one's thinking, as can other things, such as diseases, intense pain, or anguish.     Therefore, suicide is not automatically treated as a mortal sin.     We are commanded by Christ not to judge others so we leave final judgment to God who alone knows each person's heart.    The Code of Canon Law does not list suicide as a reason to deny a person a Catholic funeral or burial in a Catholic cemetery. http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__...  http://www.holycrosscemeteries.com/faq/ ...  http://home.att.net/~faithleap/suicide.h...

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states:    Suicide     2280 Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to him. It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life. We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor and the salvation of our souls. We are stewards, not owners, of the life God has entrusted to us. It is not ours to dispose of.     2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his life. It is gravely contrary to the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which we continue to have obligations. Suicide is contrary to love for the living God.     2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example, especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of scandal. Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law.     Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide.     2283 We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, its ok now. The Catholic Church now allows proper Catholic funeral services for a suicide.    See this article from TIME magazine :--  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...

It would be much easier,much wiser for everyone to practice good manners and treat everyone with decency,with respect.So,stop the race-based name-calling,the appearance-based name calling,just top the name-calling and develop a better attitude;good manners are a simply a series of small sacrifices everyone can make to make life move on more smoothly and pleasantly.

TyRfv0eoaa	Be sure you learn it from a reputable Greek source. The anglicized versions of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. are not correct, and the letter values given in some Greek Lexicons (particularly religious ones) are also incorrect.

d8fSVX23aa	Not sure but the first means to seek revenge on a friend ( to make the friend suffer) The other means to seek revenge on behalf of your friend (to do it for them against someone else).|`|IFd94XDkaa	I would say they mean the same thing but it isn't worded correctly.  You don't say "to revenge".  I think you should say "to get revenge".      to get revenge on a friend for stealing some money.|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	"To revenge oneself on a friend for stealing some money" is sort of correct but it's a formal and somewhat old fashioned use of "revenge". In American English at least, "revenge" is rarely used as a verb - "avenge" is usually preferred in that use, though it's preferred syntax is a little different.    "To revenge a friend for stealing some money" isn't really correct (though it depends on what you meant exactly - "to revenge a friend on a thief for stealing his money" might work, but it should be clear who did what). Usually, we would say "to get revenge on a friend for stealing some money" or sometimes "take revenge". Using the old form, it would be "to revenge oneself on a friend for stealing money." The object of the verb "revenge" is the person on whose account the act is done. The person to whom the act is done is the object of the preposition "on" and the cause is the object of "for".    "to revenge the beneficiary [on the perpetrator] [for the deed]"    But remember, this is rather archaic and bookish. You'll almost never hear it in spoken English. Some dialects also use "to revenge the deed" but it sounds strange in my American dialect.    For avenge, it's:    "to avenge the deed" OR "to avenge the beneficiary [on the perpetrator] [for the deed]" though "avenge" only rarely takes the "on the perpetrator" phrase.     For the noun phrase (which is the most common syntax):    "to get/take/seek revenge [on the perpetrator] [for the deed]."    Several different verbs can be used, but those are the more common ones. "Get" is especially informal. "Vengeance" can replace "revenge" there, but it's less common. The beneficiary is less commonly named in the noun phrase, but it would (confusingly) be "for the beneficiary", which is probably why we tend to use "avenge" if we want to name the beneficiary. E.g. "to get revenge for the beneficiary on the perpetrator for the deed." The beneficiary can also be the possessor of revenge, but usually only if the beneficiary is also the subject taking the revenge, e.g. "Bob got his revenge".     There are other prepositional phrases that occur, like "against the perpetrator."    "The young lady who came to Bob to revenge for her mother could have killed him in cold blood." isn't right either.    It would be better as:    "The young lady who came to Bob to seek revenge for her mother could have killed him in cold blood."     or    "The young lady who came to Bob to avenge her mother could have killed him in cold blood."|`|I39oB4QTaa	Neither one sounds right to me. They sound like they would mean the same, though.    I'm no expert on grammar, but "To get revenge on a friend for stealing money" sounds more spoken, but I'm not sure if any of tehse are actually correct.     Actually, a native English speaker may not be the best person to consult! :)
aDXsUPYRaa	yea i felt that way before and just for once|`|OuMhera8aa	I did for about 8 months, but then I finally looked at myself in the mirror, looked at all the scars and cuts, and said. What am I doing. I'm doing this because of them. They're letting me do this to myself, and they don't even care. It's hard to move on, but when someone doesn't want you, they don't want you. They are horrible, but crying over them doesn't make them come back. Don't date anyone else for  a while, wait until you're fully over them. Just every time you feel the urge to call them or want to takl to them, restrain it. Breathe in and breathe out. Live your life just for yourself for a little while, it does you good.|`|5iiQnjE2aa	yeah, i've felt that way before...with some negative consequences. some distance and perspective got me over that.    a few words of advice- if loving someone makes you lose yourself and your perspective it is not healthy, no matter how strong the feelings are.|`|B7UIP9QYaa	If this feeling is shared, it can be the most beautiful experience of your life as you know you have found your twin flame. But if you are the only one feeling that way, you'd be drained off by the other and when things break you remain  totally empty and devastated but even though the few moments of this intense happiness were worth it and the experience makes you stronger and gives more depth to your feelings because you   have experienced true love and you just want to experience it again with someone who will share it back with you.    That is our search, find our true loving companion because when you have found him / her your life is   a wonderful experience every day. Higher and higher every day in a storm of love!    Cheers.

mQZDizMVaa	Always maintain your sense of decorum, professionalism and ethics and continue being yourself in the face of adversity.    Sounds like you're working with a clique-they've banded together to make the workplace a living hell for others. Schoolyard behavior.    Save your energy and don't put them in their place. Ignore them-unless they're really affecting your work performance, and the enviroment's turning hostile, then it's time to document.    I know what you're going through. I also worked with nasty, difficult coworkers and the way I got through that was to simply ignored them, maintained my self-confidence and professionalism, treated others no less than I'd treat myself and at the end of the day, walked out with my head held high. It also helps if you create a life outside the workplace-it helps to 'ease the pain' of a negative workplace.    Good luck.|`|Ue5mbS5Laa	it can be done in 2 ways:  1- put the other person lower...and so u are higher.  or: u get up and then you will be higher!  get it?|`|JcwjDpY8aa	I think you would be the bigger person by *not* stooping to their level, which is OBVIOUSLY a low one without any sort of moral work ethic or respect for others.  I recommend treating them with respect, and never backing down yourself.  This is the way to keep your dignity, not stoop to their level of ignorance, and develop respect from others who witness your maturity.|`|aa4de9b3ec59bb8460ddd7367ffa1afcaa	What is it you mean by 'losing who you are as a person'?       While I guess I don't know from this exactly where you work or the atmosphere that would prevail there, I do know that any environment that operates as you describe is probably not the best working environment for someone worried about 'losing themselves as a person' as they assert their place in the pecking order.   While this economy probably doesn't afford the job choice you might enjoy otherwise, I'd say your best bet is to see if you can't find a different job.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	How do you lose who you are by telling somebody to back off you?

xji8EFDYaa	I think it's a serious problem,whether it's mental or not.         I had a friend that would lie about really stupid things,things that didn't even make sense. Like,dying for example. They told me they had cancer and yet they didn't. It boggles my mind why anyone would want to lie about something like that,especially to someone they considered as a friend,or so you thought.       I say confront her. Tell her that she will never make friends if she continues doing this and nobody will like her. There may be an underlying cause that goes much deeper than just lying for the hell of it.|`|dPULl5hjaa	No, your sister doesn't have a mental issue.    Your sister has a compulsive lying problem and only she can correct if she wants to.  Maybe she does it for attention - who knows.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	I think that it is somewhat of a mental illness because habitual liars make lies part of their mental reality. I have an aunt who is also a habitual liar... like your sister, she lies about things that aren't even worth lying about. I think that my aunt does it to make herself and family look a little better. For instance, she ran into an old high school of her sister M and told the woman that her sister M was getting her PhD. Of course the woman later ran into M and told said to her " I saw your sister recently and she told me that you are getting your PhD... congratulations". My aunt said that was looked dumbfounded because she just knew that my aunt had lied. When I was in college there was a girl who had the most ridiculous stores and even though they were clearly untrue they were terribly entertaining. She told us that her boyfriend had taken her on a date and had picked her up in a helicopter the night before which he landed on the roof of the dorm, and she was so serious when she told us this. I truly believe that it is a type of mental illness, but not in the traditional sense of mental illness that we see. I believe that they truly truly truly cannot help the stories that they make up because it's like it really happened. It might be somewhat of a warped perception of reality. I think that it's a natural tendency and that it can, but can't be helped. If you notice- to a babitual liar they aren't lying and many times they can recall the same story as if it happened. This is just what I think based on the experiences that I have have with people like this.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	It is not a serious mental disorder and is probably a symptom of her being very unhappy about something, as youre her sister, you should confront her about this.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	She sounds like a gossip to me.    Some people are pathological liars, but that is rare in comparison to "habitual" liars.  Your sister might have some serious low self-esteem issues. That is a common cause of this behavior.|`|TudZYPN5aa	why do you notice the spec of dust in your sisters eye, when you do not stop to realize the plank in your own eye?    ^taken from the bible|`|mFf8CqAraa	Pathological lying is also called pseudologia fantastica or mythomania. The lies are usually fluent and plausible and the untrue statements and often grandiose and extreme. Particularly in times of heightened emotion, memory is falsified and distorted and events and circumstances misinterpreted.    Psychologists and psychiatrists fail to account for a specific definition of pathological lying as a disease. It can be symptomatic of other conditions, like antisocial personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is not always present in these conditions, so a clear treatment set for pathological lying has not been defined.    Also there is a distinct difference between pathological liars and deliberate liars. The pathological liar usually believes their false answers: as a rule of thumb, deliberate liars know when they are lying, and pathological liars do not always.    Below are some very informative sites that talk about pathological liars and possible causes and treatment. Treatment of course requires the consent of the liar.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	They want to seem more interesting/acceptable so they lie.  They feel that just being themselves isn't enough.  It is a sickness and generally people who habitually lie need counselling to get over whatever issues they have.|`|rThIVk2maa	Oh do I ever have sympathy for you!! I am related to a person who does this same thing for the weirdest reason.     This person is an idealist and wants everybody to be happy. He tries to keep people happy by telling them what he thinks they want to hear. This often means making things up or lying about the most inconsequential things, leaving us thinking "why would you lie about that?"    The best I can figure out is when the person says something you're sure isn't true, to ask them to go into more detail. If they are so afraid of being judged badly for it, they'll often beg off or fess up, but most of the time they'll just make a more elaborate lie. Don't call them on it because they'll be humiliated, but you can raise an eyebrow and say "hrm. interesting." and end the conversation that way.    It's just really frustrating to watch though and very hard to believe anything he/she says.|`|ugMlQN1haa	I have a little brother that is exactly like that. He is a habitual liar! It gets to me sometimes because he lies about the stupidest things and You never know when he's telling the truth. He will literally make up stories about people walking down the street and just elaborate on this big fat lie, sometimes I just don't want him to open his mouth because everything is such a lie. He gets in trouble a lot at school, and then lies about getting positive referrals(Like little awards for being good). He always says he got one, but they ran out of paper for his. lol. What a little liar. He is only 9, but i'm sure he does it for attention.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	i think you're right and she needs help.good luck its got to be terribly hard to be friends with someone like that let alone sisters.what you can do is call her out on in,by not letting her get away with this behavior even if it means embarrassing her in front of people she'll be forced to change her wicked ways.she obviously won't be able to tell someone a lie in front of you if you won't let her get away with it.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	I don't think its a mental issue, but an emotional one.

AA11212224	Sounds like you watched Zeitgeist.    Some things to keep in mind:  1.  Zeitgeist is based off of shoddy "research."  NONE of the sources they used are experts in the field they're commenting on.  That's right, none of them.  You can look it up if you don't believe me.  One of the main sources for the movie, Acharya S (AKA D.M. Murdock) has only one thing I don't:  A Bachelor's in Liberal Arts.  Does that make her more qualified to comment on Egyptology than Richard Wilkinson, who actually is an Egyptologist?  No.  That's silly.  The sources for this movie are the atheist equivalent of "Dr. Dino."  2.  Jesus was not born on December 25th, so even if all these other gods were, it's irrelevant.  3.  None of the gods mentioned, except perhaps Attis, were born of a virgin.  In the case of Attis, it's simply unknown.  4.  None of the gods mentioned were able to perform the same miracles Jesus was, apart from perhaps Dionysus, who did indeed in one tradition turn water into wine.  However, this tradition POST-dates Christianity.  5.  None of the gods mentioned were crucified.  Horus was killed by a scorpion as a child.  Mithras never even died.  Dionysus died of old age, if at all.  Krishna was pierced by an arrow while he napped against a tree.  Attis castrated himself.    Did Jesus really exist?  There's too much evidence that he did to possibly deny it.  But was Jesus the Son of God and everything else that the Bible says He was?  That really is a matter of faith.|`|AA10067344	If I were a betting man, I'd put money on Jesus and Socrates both being based on real people.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	There are a lot of videos that are total malarkey.

0SoVa5braa	Russians are purely European (eastern european to be more precious i.e. slavonic), they can't have asian features. When you see a russian with typical asian appearance then it means he (she) is not ethnically russian, but of one of the numerous nationalities inhabiting Russia mostly it's Asian part (Yakuts, Altaians, Chukchi, Buryats, etc. - all of them are of the Mongoloid race). This has nothing to do with neighbor countries such as China, Mongolia or Kazakhstan - traditionally Russian people enter into relations with other nations very seldom but only within their ethnic group or race.

She may be 1/4 Asian. Why? Since she has blue eyes, it is impossible to obtain them from one Asian and one Caucasian parent therefore one of her parents was half Asian and carried a hidden gene for blue (recessive) eyes which derived from the other half (Caucasian) while her Caucasian parent had blue eyes which combine together to give her blue eyes and there was a possibility for them to be brown. The other way she may have obtained blue eyes if both her parents were Eurasians.     This has too much to do with genealogy and it too complex to explain in detail.

Hey, will you actually be using real wine? The Scottish J.W's were far too stingy to lash out on real wine - they just passed round Ribena. After all, only 2 or 3 people were going to drink it and they were far too polite to say anything. Then again, the Baptist church I attended in England used Ribena - I guess that's not a 'deal-breaker'. It's the thought that counts.    Talking of which, isn't it heart-breaking to realise 99% of all J.W's are told they cannot be in the new covenant, that their sins have not been forgiven and they are not saved? I pray you will be granted the courage to go through with this - it's a brilliant idea!

I had to answer this however, because it's a great question and I want to keep an eye on the answers.    Here's a star.    To those above.  You must be one of the lucky ones.  People are loosing their homes, their jobs, their insurance, their cars.  I am not quite sure what world YOU are living in.  But this isn't about missing a night out once and awhile.  This is about struggling to buy milk and bread, of getting your sick children in to see a doctor when you can't afford their health insurance anymore.  If you can't afford milk and bread.  How do you take them to the doctor?  WAKE UP PEOPLE!  Climb out of your little self indulgent holes.

He was a young man during the "great" depression. Basically, what he said is that families tended to stay together and help each other. Big gardens were common and so was livestock, hunting, fishing, etc. Even in towns people raised rabbits and planted gardens. Those that had no means were basically brought along by the rest of the family. He said that sometimes people left home in order not to be a burden and that in many of those cases they wound up chasing rumors of work (I guess these were the hobo's). I notice that he always put out this huge garden tho even in his later years when he lived alone. Also the guy never threw a single thing away... saved everything for reuse.

Just because you are only 20 yrs. old should not automatically signify to others that you are a self-indulgent "brat" with an expensive car, plasma tv, etc., and had everything handed to you!  I dislike categorizing people of any age!    I agree with Nana T's answer in it's entirety!  We are not talking about plasma tv's here - we are talking about a country in crisis!  Hello?!  People may not be standing in bread lines, but they are standing in food banks (many of which are exhausting their supplies) for hours at a time.  People are losing their homes, being evicted out into the streets, going hungry, and are losing all hope.  Just as in the Great Depression, people are commiting suicide in despondency!      The only advice that I can offer you, is from my heart.  Take whatever job you can get right now, and remember that you have your whole life ahead of you yet.  Keep a positive outlook, even in the face of adversity, and never, ever give up hope!|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	If you think things are bad now, just wait.

There is NO comparision !  The depression was caused by or accompanied by drought conditions which devestated the agricultural industry and all the people engaged in it !    This is like a man with an itchy toe complaining to a man with no legs that he is worse off.

The saddest part about the equation is that even though FDR took uncanny measures to prevent another "GREAT" one, we stupid voters are not demanding the government limit it's spending enough to balance the budget.  Ross Perot brought the unlimited government spending to the fore front in the '92 election. Bill Clinton balanced the budget and we experienced 8 yrs. of prosperity.  The government is still one of the few places we can seek a job ... as few as there are it's an indication that it is still trying to get bigger.  The government has wasted billions of dollars trying to incorporate ridiculous programs (like relocating the banana slug) for many, many years.

Many children were cold and hungry. Those who lived through those times never forgot it or failed to impress on us what it could be like. Keep looking and you will find a job.

And although some government and other help that was not available during the depression might now be here, a lot of that help is not available if you are under 65, not considered disabled, and do not have children under 18.  So you might really need help and it not be there.    But during the depression people were more willing to help, more willing to share what they had.  My mother, grandmother, sometimes gave food to complete strangers, black and white, we live in the South, who came to their door.  Imagine people doing that today.    More people lived on farms and could scratch things out off the land.  It wasn't easy, but it sure helped.    People were more willing to take in family members.  Most everyone with any extra room, or not, had a homeless family member living with them.    In many areas, much of the South, for instance, it was still possible to just move into an empty house and farm the surrounding land without anyone trying to throw you off.

lNtwpzpOaa	(The stupid thing won't post my entire answer, so if you would like more examples, please refer to the link in My Sources. There are many more writings that are not listed here.)    Yes.     There is valid teaching of the Eucharist by the Early Church Fathers from the very beginning of the readings.    It isn't always stated as the Eucharist (as the first time that word is used--in writing--is 107), but it is a clear teaching:    "They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again." Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to Smyrnaeans, 7,1 (c. A.D. 110).    "For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh." Justin Martyr, First Apology, 66 (c. A.D. 110-165).     "[T]he bread over which thanks have been given is the body of their Lord, and the cup His blood..." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, IV:18,4 (c. A.D. 200).       "For the blood of the grape--that is, the Word--desired to be mixed with water, as His blood is mingled with salvation. And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual, that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh. Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man. And the one, the mixture of wine and water, nourishes to faith; while the other, the Spirit, conducts to immortality. And the mixture of both--of the water and of the Word--is called Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake of it are sanctified both in body and soul." Clement of Alexandria, The Instructor, 2 (ante A.D. 202).     "For because Christ bore us all, in that He also bore our sins, we see that in the water is understood the people, but in the wine is showed the blood of Christ...Thus, therefore, in consecrating the cup of the Lord, water alone cannot be offered, even as wine alone cannot be offered. For if any one offer wine only, the blood of Christ is dissociated from us; but if the water be alone, the people are dissociated from Christ; but when both are mingled, and are joined with one another by a close union, there is completed a spiritual and heavenly sacrament. Thus the cup of the Lord is not indeed water alone, nor wine alone, unless each be mingled with the other; just as, on the other hand, the body of the Lord cannot be flour alone or water alone, unless both should be united and joined together and compacted in the mass of one bread; in which very sacrament our people are shown to be made one, so that in like manner as many grains, collected, and ground, and mixed together into one mass, make one bread; so in Christ, who is the heavenly bread, we may know that there is one body, with which our number is joined and united." Cyprian, To Caeilius, Epistle 62(63):13 (A.D. 253).     "Having learn these things, and been fully assured that the seeming bread is not bread, though sensible to taste, but the Body of Christ; and that the seeming wine is not wine, though the taste will have it so, but the Blood of Christ; and that of this David sung of old, saying, And bread strengtheneth man's heart, to make his face to shine with oil, 'strengthen thou thine heart,' by partaking thereof as spiritual, and "make the face of thy soul to shine."" Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lectures, XXII:8 (c. A.D. 350).       if a person sees bread he also, in a kind of way, looks on a human body, for by the bread being within it the bread becomes it, so also, in that other case, the body into which God entered, by partaking of the nourishment of bread, was, in a certain measure, the same with it; that nourishment, as we have said, changing itself into the nature of the body. For that which is peculiar to all flesh is acknowledged also in the case of that flesh, namely, that that Body too was maintained by bread; which Body also by the indwelling of God the Word was transmuted to the dignity of Godhead. Rightly, then, do we believe that now also the bread which is consecrated by the Word of God is changed into the Body of God the Word. For that Body was once, by implication, bread, but has been consecrated by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in the flesh. Therefore, from the same cause as that by which the bread that was transformed in that Body was changed to a Divine potency, a similar result takes place now. For as in that case, too, the grace of the Word used to make holy the Body, the substance of which came of the bread, and in a manner was itself bread, so also in this case the bread, as says the Apostle, 'is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer'; not that it advances by the process of eating to the stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it is at once changed into the body by means of the Word, as the Word itself said, 'This is My Body.' Gregory of Nyssa, The Great Catechism, 37 (post A.D. 383).     "Perhaps you will say, 'I see something else, how is it that you assert that I receive the Body of Christ?' And this is the point which remains for us to prove. And what evidence shall we make use of? Let us prove that this is not what nature made, but what the blessing consecrated, and the power of blessing is greater than that of nature, because by blessing nature itself is changed...The Lord Jesus Himself proclaims: 'This is My Body.' Befor|`|AA11796124	I'll be blunt. . .    Bottom Line is this - believing in the Real Presense of the Eucharist is a matter of faith.    There is NOTHING anyone here can say that will somehow automatically make you believe in it.    You claim you want to see "evidence" or "proof". You're not going to find it, not where you're looking. You're looking in the wrong places because you're looking for the 'wrong' kind of 'evidence' and 'proof'.    Look in the Bible; Gospel of John, Chapter Six. This is the "magna carta" for the Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	Read John  6    Here is what Saint Ignatius said regarding:    Transubstantiation-  "They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes."(Letter to the Smymaeans Chapter VII)    The Bodily ressurrection of Christ-  "For I know that after His [Christ's] ressurrection also He was still posessed of flesh, and I believe that he is so now [Keep in mind that he is writing years AFTER Jesus ascended to Heaven]. (Letter to the Smyrnaeans Chapter III)    Regarding Christ's Deity-  "Ye have done well in recieving Philo and Rheus Agathopus as servants of Christ our God, who have followed me for the sake of God, and who give thanks to the Lord in your behalf, because you in every way have refreshed them." (Letter to the Smyrnaeans Chapter X)    Please don't say that this man wasn't inspired, or that this man was not in harmoney with the Bible. This man was a personal friend of Saint Peter, and studied Christ under Saint John. He wrote these letters on his way to Rome where he was EATEN BY LIONS. Saint Ignatius was the Second (or third) Bishop of Antioch, the First place where Christians were called Christians.    Saint Ignatius knew what the Apostles knew about Jesus, and his works come from the same time period as the Books of the Bible.    When a First Century Christian believes this, why doen't you, and why do you refer to these Martyrs as your First Century Christian Brothers|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Certainly the Eucharist is food for the believer if one is to believe Jesus in His colloquy at Capernaum. It is food for endurance till eternal life. It provides the grace necessary to complete the race. Jesus compares it to the manna that was eaten in the desert to sustain the Israelites. But Jesus is speaking of the New Covenant requiring a new sustenance which is His Body and Blood. In making this comparison He says that real bread comes from the father just as He and then says that He is the bread of life. If one eats this bread they will live forever. The disciples listening to Him began to realize that Jesus was not speaking metaphorically but literally and then we come to the following verse:     (Joh 6:52 DRB) (6:53) The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat    Then Jesus said in unambiguous literal language:    (Joh 6:53 DRB) (6:54) Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you.    The following verse indicates the purpose of eating His body and drinking His blood. It is so that we can abidete or in other words remains in Him by the Grace bestowed by the act of receiving His Body and His Blood. But the Eucharist benefits us even more in that it augments our union with Christ as the principal fruit of receiving the Eucharist is an intimate union with Christ.     (Joh 6:56 DRB) (6:57) He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me: and I in him.    An additional benefit of the Eucharist is that it is impossible to unite to Christ without the cleansing of past sins and preserving us from future sins through His grace. This is part of the sanctification process where we grow in our faith in him which separates us further from the risk of mortal sin. Additionally, the Eucharist participation renews, strengthens and deepens ones incorporation into the Church which is achieved through Baptism. It joins us to the entire Church Militant, Suffering and Triumphant.    This is what St. Ignatius said about the Eucharist at the end of the first century,  the one bread that provides the medicine of immortality, the antidote for death, and the food that makes live forever in Jesus Christ.    One may ask the question does Gods spiritual work always require a physical channel. Always is a very dangerous position to take when speaking of God as God can as our sovereign creator do things however he wishes. So this is really not a matter of always but instead, did God use the physical channel of Jesus transforming simple bread and wine into His body and Blood to bestow the Grace of eternal life.    I was reading another apologists commentary some time ago and He related how some Protestants get an almost Docetist view when it comes to the Eucharist. They have no problem believing something to be spiritual but when it comes to mixing spirit and matter they seem to experience intellectual and theological mind block. This is the usual excuse for not believing in Sacraments because a spiritual reality is being conveyed by means of matter. They may even believe that this is a violation of the divine plan. Matter instead of being used is to be avoided which would explain why some have difficulties understanding the incarnation. Many believe that it would be much easier if God did not dirty himself with matter. The Eucharist proves that God loves matter because He comes to us under the appearance of bread and wine. In doing so there is no contradiction in Christ being physically and Sacramentally present.     One may question how can Christ be present in the Eucharist and be also in heaven and that is a fair question. First of all, in my explanation let me make it clear that how Christ performs this miracle is a great mystery that we accept on faith through our spirit to His. If we look at the account of the last supper we see Jesus present in two ways. He is present at the table in a natural way and is present also in a sacramental way which is no different than the Eucharistic experience today and through the history of the Church. How this is done while being a mystery is not impossibility just because it cannot be understood fully with our reason. We can all accept as Christians that God is everywhere and that He is present in a spiritual sense when we are gathered together. This is no greater a mystery than him reigning in heaven in His glorified body and on earth in His natural body. If he can create the universe from nothing can he not make bread and wine into His Body and Blood? These things may be beyond our understanding but certainly not beyond Gods abilities.     For those who do not believe in the real presence there are the difficulties of the following verses:    (1Co 11:26 DRB) For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.    (1Co 11:27 DRB) Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.    (1Co 11:28 DRB) But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice.    (1Co 11:29 DRB) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.    (1Co 11:30 DRB) Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.    People who refuse to believe in the real presence believe that this represents a metaphor. But, if it is a mere metaphor, how can one be guilty of the body and Blood when one receives unworthily? As one scholar put it Plain and simple reason seem to tell us that the presence of Christs body is necessary for an offense committed against it. (Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman, Lectures on |`|JMOLRKRraa	I don't fully understand your question. I know the Mass comes from the Last Supper. That came from the Passover. that came from God's intent to save man from death. The Old Testament seems figurative of the New Testament. Ever notice how God says things twice. Once is creation, second is the doing, the creation.  I will witness to the fact, the light of Holy Communion casts out depression, fear, darkness, thoughts of suicide. So I am receiving light.  Love casts out fear, I am receiving Love. Jesus helps me thru my weak, we become more like Him, I know the change when I go more constantly to Mass and Communion. I am receiving Jesus, no doubt.

Also, in John 6, when Jesus says "eat my body and drink my blood." The Greek word used for "eat" is the literal word for chew and gnaw. It was not a figurative meaning but an actual one.     St. Paul tells us in 1 Cor. 11:29 - For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.    ADDED: Yes, the early Church specifically taught the "real presence of Christ in the Eucharist." I don't know that you'll find that exact sentence, but in everything they said wrote about the Eucharist, they indicate a belief that it is the true Body and Blood of Christ, and not a representation.|`|3PuKXEwZaa	The earliest Christians confirmed the real presence in the Eucharist.

Many early Christian writers have referenced it making this document relatively easy to date.     "Let no one eat and drink of your Eucharist but those baptized in the name of the Lord; to this, too the saying of the Lord is applicable: 'Do not give to dogs what is sacred'".     -Ch. 9:5     "On the Lord's own day, assemble in common to break bread and offer thanks; but first confess your sins, so that your sacrifice may be pure. However, no one quarreling with his brother may join your meeting until they are reconciled; your sacrifice must not be defiled. For here we have the saying of the Lord: 'In every place and time offer me a pure sacrifice; for I am a mighty King, says the Lord; and my name spreads terror among the nations.'"|`|AA11598520	"exegesis" cool word. I always like learning new ones.     Anyway, it isn't comprehensible to us, either. That's why we call it a mystery and we use faith to believe it.

Wouldn't it be impossible not to even IF we use other authorities to guide our reading?    I understood you and I respect that you would do the research yourself. I hope these two sites help.

6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	That's very sad and i feel your pain    : (  The 'silent treatment' usually comes from those who are insecure - and often jealousy is a motive to hurt in this way.    This has happened to me a number of times and always with the same person. A christian friend of mine seemed to always be picking faults with me, until one day we discussed it. My friend actually admitted she was jealous of my relationship with the Lord - it took me aback somewhat...    As for scripture on 'silent treatment'  Jesus would never condone this for any reason - He was never cruel to anyone - although He did speak the truth and some were offended.    Anyway, reading your added details - how cruel of him to say that to you. I don't know what i can do to help, but i'm sending love your way right now and hope you feel better and at peace...      T xx     (((hug)))  ~~~    did he actually say it to hurt you?  --   it can depend on attitude - not necessarily what we say but how we say it....  I still feel your pain though ....  ~~~    Hello again    ; )  In reply to your comment to me:   ''Shunning'' isn't a term Christians use - Jehovah witnesses do - maybe that's your word, or maybe he is JW. I'm interested to know. If he is a good friend he will know how much his actions are affecting you.    You must remember you are a complete human being and not to let that comment pierce your soul.     Do you know what! it's time for some straight talking here!  He said he would forgive you if you reacted in anger - who does he think he is!?    --    you know righteous anger is justified  --  sounds to me like he enjoys having control over your feelings - if you want my honest opinion;  tell him how you honestly feel and let him deal with it - don't feel guilty for who you are or how you feel - be yourself: *To Thine Own Self Be True* -  be the person God intended you to be and stop looking for biblical answers to issues with this man - just be yourself b'c you are a good person   ; )    There i've said it and i mean every word.|`|bb2c6db52d268375a8f75ea7c3169389aa	The part where you took the blame and vocally expressed it might have been why you feel rejected. Well in order to get to any type of communication, both usually agree to meet there. Don't take it too personal. I'm sure he is feeling similar.  At one time, your thoughts in communication was true. You know what you knew and had experience to back it up. There seems to have been an agreement to disagree on certain ideas also. I think the feeling is natural and temporary to feel rejected.    It's always a learning experience and even the greatest thinkers might have had situations that could be displayed as setbacks. No matter what it is really a part of moving forward in a way. You can bring up the past and relive it over and over or use what you can and keep pressing on.    I'm not sure exactly how close this person is but everyone seems to feel right about somethings in their lives. If communication closes, please do not assume the worst. Try to stay positive.    Instead of the silent treatment, view it as patience. Its an idea that might work.    If I were you, I would find ways to relax for a while until the positive energy comes back. You know what helps you most. Maybe some type of charity or thinking of things others have done to help you get where you are. The beauty of life is always there and you surely know this to be true. I have seen your inquires and it helps me interpret beauty from that perspective as well.  Good afternoon.  --corey|`|9ZY5zYvNaa	I'm not going to dwell upon his beliefs.

Ask him what if - when he said sorry to jesus for all his sins and jesus ignored him - what would he feel like.    Check out this site - you may gain the insight of the Love of Jesus    http://www.freecdtracts.com/    verse from the Bible - that may help him see his error :    Proverbs 17:9  Love prospers when a fault is forgiven, but dwelling on it separates close friends.    Proverbs 10:12  Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs    1 Corinthians 13:1-8a and 13  If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.    Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.    Love never fails....And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.      Ephesians 5:25  Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.     Ephesians 5:33  However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.     Colossians 3:14  And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.     Hope you husband see's what a loving partner you are and forgives as he would want to be forgave.    God Bless|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	I am going to state the obvious, just because your friend is a Christian does not mean he may always act in a Christ-like manner.  No human is perfect.    Your act of forgiveness is actually very "Christ-Like".   He could be shunning you for any number of reasons from being embarrassed to not wanting to be your friend any more.  That is something that he may eventually choose to share with you (or not).      If you two enjoy debate, why not consider midrash style of conversation?   This could help the debating/arguing to be more constructive and benificial to both of you.   Check out "The Burning Word" by Judith Kunst.       I wish both of you the best in your friendship.

The Silent Treatment is a sound Bible Doctrine:       PROVERBS 26:4.    4. Answer not a fool according to his folly,   lest thou also be like unto him.    "FOOLISHNESS" is defined as NOT KEEPING JESUS' TEACHINGS:       MATTHEW 7:26-27.    26. "And every one that heareth   these Sayings of mine, and doeth them not,  shall be likened unto a Foolish Man,   which built his house upon the Sand:  27. "And the rain descended, and the floods came,   and the winds blew, and beat upon that House;   and it Fell: and Great was The Fall of it."    WHEN YOUR "FRIEND" is a "devout Christian" and you are NOT, what can you be doing but trying to corrupt and destroy his relationship with God?       LUKE 14:25-34.    25. And there went great multitudes with him:   and he turned, and said unto them,  26. "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,  and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,   yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple.  27. "And whosoever doth not bear his cross,   and come after me, cannot be my Disciple.  28. "For which of you, intending to build a tower,   sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost,   whether he have sufficient to finish it?  29. "Lest haply, after he hath laid the Foundation,   and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,  30. "Saying,   'This man began to build,   and was not able to finish.'  31. "Or what king, going to make war against another king,  sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able  with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him   with twenty thousand?  32. "Or else, while the other is yet a great way off,   he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.  33. "So likewise, whosoever he be of you   that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Disciple.  34. "Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour,   wherewith shall it be seasoned?  35. "It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill;  but men cast it out.   He that hath ears to hear,   let him hear."    "THE SILENT TREATMENT" is NOT an expression of LOVE toward the person so treated. The EXCUSE is the prioritized Love toward GOD.       LUKE 16:11-15.    11. "If therefore ye have not been faithful   in the Unrighteous Mammon,  who will commit to your trust the True Riches?  12. "And if ye have not been faithful   in that which is another man's,  who shall give you that which is your own?  13. "No servant can serve two masters:   for either he will hate the one,   and love the other;   or else he will hold to the one,   and despise the other.   Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  14. "And the Pharisees also, who were covetous,   heard all these things: and they derided him."  15. And he said unto them,   "Ye are they which justify yourselves before men;   but God knoweth your hearts:   for that which is highly esteemed among men   is abomination in the sight of God."    THIS SAID, to be using "Spiritual Tactics" against another person, YOUR OWN LIFE MUST BE EXEMPLARY. "Righteous Judgment" means submitting to the same standards as the ones we are imposing upon others. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE for a Believer in Jesus to be FRIENDS with someone who DOES NOT BELIEVE in Jesus nor the Principles he stood and and stands for.|`|sopPnzC0aa	*Shunning*    -"Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers.

First let me say, your friend was totally wrong to tell you, " because you don't have God in my life, you are  an "incomplete human being."  Doing such a thing breaks one of the commandments of Jesus, "Judge not lest you be judged."  Another bible verse saying the same thing:    Luke 6:37   Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.    As Christians we are commanded, not asked, commanded to do these this.  We are also commanded to forgive others as the Lord forgives us:    Colossians 3:13   Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.     I suggest you forward this thread to your friend.  I pray you get things settled between the two of you.  Love is a precious treasurein this life.

It is not for a mere argument.    He should be open to teach/discuss with those outside the faith.  He has no Bible reason to shun you now if he did not before.    I'd say he is being childish and trying to punish you himself.    On the other hand, you could have hurt his feelings in a way you hadn't before.  I did not hear the argument so can't make a guess at anything personal that may be offending him.  Only that Biblically you did nothing to deserve shunning/silent treatment.

Some times there are things that are coincident, as you can get lucky and find a large amount of money some where, or you can go to a certain place and keep seen the same people  each time you go to this place, or you could be sick, when the Doctors gave up on you and just in a sudden, you just get better and surprise every one, so a coincident, is some thing unexpected that  you are surprised about, and yes we live in a coincidental World.  Your  Destine, is what you make it, example, some people are born into puberty, and if they chose not to be lacking of any thing, they can get a degree, work hard, become productive, and live  a life of luckiness. While on the other hand , one can be born rich, and live a bad life, miss used one money in the Things of  the World  and end up  poor.So I believe your Destiny is what you  make of it.I have seen people raise and fall they were not born  with these courses , each person  decided to do what ever they wanted, and made their own destine....Good Question!|`|DlL98tVHaa	all destined.|`|AA10554783	Coincidence, Yes.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	It is both!

TRANSLATION     The living entities are trying to counteract different miserable conditions pertaining to providence, other living entities or the body and mind. Still, they must remain conditioned by the laws of nature, despite all attempts to counter these laws.                                 PURPORT     Just as a dog wanders here and there for a piece of bread or punishment, the living entity perpetually wanders about trying to be happy and planning in so many ways to counteract material misery. This is called the struggle for existence. We can actually see in our daily lives how we are forced to make plans to drive away miserable conditions. To get rid of one miserable condition, we have to put ourselves in another kind of miserable condition. A poor man suffers for want of money, but if he wants to become rich, he has to struggle in so many ways. Actually that is not a valid counteracting process but a snare of the illusory energy. If one does not endeavor to counteract his situation but is satisfied with his position, knowing that he has obtained his position through past activities, he can instead engage his energy to develop Krsna consciousness. This is recommended in all Vedic literature.                     tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido                na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah                tal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham                   kalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa       "Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them." (Bhag. 1.5.18) One should simply try to develop his Krsna consciousness and not waste his time trying to improve his material condition. Actually the material condition cannot be improved. The process of improvement means accepting another miserable condition. However, if we endeavor to improve our Krsna consciousness, the distresses of material life will disappear without extraneous endeavor. Krsna therefore promises, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes." (Bg. 9.31) One who takes to the path of devotional service will never be vanquished, despite all miseries of the body and mind and despite all misery brought about by other living entities and providence, miseries which are beyond our control.    CAT 2          PROGRESSING BEYOND "PROGRESS"             books     Vedic civilization is different. As Narada Muni says, tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah: the learned, astute person will use this life to gain what he has missed in countless prior lives--namely, realization of self and realization of God. Someone may ask, "Then shall we do nothing?" Yes do nothing simply to improve your material position. Whatever material happiness is allotted for you by destiny, you'll get it wherever you are. Take to Krsna consciousness. You'll get these other things besides.     "How shall I get them?"     How? Kalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa: by the arrangement of eternal time, everything will come about in due course. The example is given that even though you do not want distress, still distress comes upon you. Similarly, even if you do not work hard for the happiness that is destined to be yours, still it will come.     Similarly, Prahlada Maharaja says, na tat-prayasah kartavyam: you should not waste your energy for material happiness, because you cannot get more than what you are destined to have. That is not possible. "How can I believe it--that by working harder I will not get more material happiness than I would otherwise have had?"     Because you are undergoing so many distressing conditions even though you do not want them. Who wants distress? For example, in our country, Mahatma Gandhi was killed by his own countrymen. He was a great man, he was protected by so many followers, he was beloved by all--and still he was killed. Destiny. Who can protect you from all these distressing conditions?    730817BG.LON                 Lectures     Therefore Bhagavata says that do not try to change your destiny. Everyone is trying to change the destiny. I am poor man, I must be very rich man. But you cannot change your destiny. Tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido na labhate yad bhramatam upary adhah. In this world we are, every one of us are bound up by the laws of karma, destiny. We have got our destiny. So much happiness, so much distress we must have. Because this is a mixture of happiness and distress. Here you cannot have unadulterated happiness. That is not possible in this... Unadulterated happiness, real happiness can be achieved in the spiritual world. Not in the material world. So certain amount of happiness and certain amount of distress we have to enjoy and suffer. You cannot change it. This is the law of nature in this material world.     Therefore Bhagavata says, tasyaiva hetoh prayetet

If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.

TRANSLATION     The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of immortality and fearlessness, and He is transcendental to death and the fruitive actions of the material world. O Narada, O brahmana, it is therefore difficult to measure the glories of the Supreme Person.                                 PURPORT     The glories of the Lord, in the transcendental seventy-five percent of the Lord's internal potency, are stated in the Padma Purana (Uttara-khanda). It is said there that those planets in the spiritual sky, which comprises the seventy-five percent expansion of the internal potency of the Lord, are far, far greater than those planets in the total universes composed of the external potency of the Lord. In the Caitanya-caritamrta, the total universes in the external potency of the Lord are compared to a bucketful of mustard seeds. One mustard seed is calculated to be a universe itself. In one of the universes, in which we are now living, the number of planets cannot be counted by human energy, and so how can we think of the sum total in all the universes, which are compared to a bucketful of mustard seeds? And the planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number of those in the material sky. Such planets, being spiritual, are in fact transcendental to the material modes; therefore they are constituted in the mode of unalloyed goodness only. The conception of spiritual bliss (brahmananda) is fully present in those planets. Each of them is eternal, indestructible and free from all kinds of inebrieties experienced in the material world. Each of them is self-illuminating and more powerfully dazzling than (if we can imagine) the total sunshine of millions of mundane suns. The inhabitants of those planets are liberated from birth, death, old age and diseases and have full knowledge of everything; they are all godly and free from all sorts of material hankerings. They have nothing to do there except to render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Narayana, who is the predominating Deity of such Vaikuntha planets. Those liberated souls are engaged incessantly in singing songs mentioned in the Sama Veda (vedaih sanga-pada-kramopanisadair gayanti yam samagah). All of them are personifications of the five Upanisads. Tripad-vibhuti, or the seventy-five percent known as the internal potency of the Lord, is to be understood as the kingdom of God far beyond the material sky; and when we speak of pada-vibhuti, or the twenty-five percent comprising His external energy, we should understand that this refers to the sphere of the material world. It is also said in the padma purana that the kingdom of tripad-vibhuti is transcendental, whereas the pada-vibhuti is mundane; tripad-vibhuti is eternal, whereas the pada-vibhuti is transient. The Lord and His eternal servitors in the transcendental kingdom all have eternal forms which are auspicious, infallible, spiritual and eternally youthful. In other words, there is no birth, death, old age and disease. That eternal land is full of transcendental enjoyment and full of beauty and bliss. This very fact is also corroborated in this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the transcendental nature is described as amrta. As described in the Vedas, utamrtatvasyesanah: the Supreme Lord is the Lord of immortality, or in other words, the Lord is immortal, and because He is the Lord of immortality He can award immortality to His devotees. In the Bhagavad-gita (8.16) the Lord also assures that whoever may go to His abode of immortality shall never return to this mortal land of threefold miseries. The Lord is not like the mundane lord. The mundane master or lord never enjoys equally with his subordinates, nor is a mundane lord immortal, nor can he award immortality to his subordinate. The Supreme Lord, who is the leader of all living entities, can award all the qualities of His personality unto His devotees, including immortality and spiritual bliss. In the material world there is always anxiety or fearfulness in the hearts of all living entities, but the Lord, being Himself the supreme fearless, also awards the same quality of fearlessness to His pure devotees. Mundane existence is itself a kind of fear because in all mundane bodies the effect|`|vmv1rP76aa	Yes and yes. To me reincarnation is true and a fact, so many of the world's faith, even many Jews and the ancient Christians (before Pauline Christianity came about) spoke of reincarnation. Its just a universal knowledge that life and death are not one and only and final. Our souls evolve and grow as God does.

But the process would be much slower.  For that reason most of us choose to be born again and face all the tests and tribulations in a bid to improve.

The reason that I have experienced is this.   The more I CHOOSE to spend time with Him, the closer I become.  His desire is to be extremely close to His children.  I have a chronic pain disease that for awhile actually drew me away from Him.  It was what I didn't do.  The lack of closeness had nothing to do with what God did.  When I realized that I could experience His grace and strength in the midst of my pain, not just when God decided to heal me, then I drew closer.  Sometimes we may not always "feel" the presence of God, but that should never negate the fact that He is present.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	It is all His Will/Grace, not in my hand.

This has comforted and strengthened me many times in my life.  Years ago when my plane landed in Vietnam and I got out to face a year of unknown dangers and challenges I comforted myself with this wonderful Psalm.  Even though I was not a professed Christian, I became a regular chapel attendee during that year.  When I divorced my first wife some years after that I strengthened my resolve by repeating those words and knowing that what I was doing was distasteful and unpleasant, but no less necessary.    And, seven years ago when I underwent surgery a nurse had me sign a disclaimer during my pre-op in which I acknowledged that I could die during or as a result of the procedure.  I have almost always felt the presence of God somewhere near me--carrying me, sustaining me, and protecting me.  But at that moment on that gurney I realized I might see God that day.    I think I said--"I'm not ready yet, God, but not my will but yours be done."    And God listened.  And I'm still not ready yet.|`|e50c8aae94677952ee9beadc76ab4c1baa	While doing service and doing Bhajans I have felt closest to God.

And there is also a unique purpose what each of us is born to do. By finding and living that purpose we can feel closeness with God.|`|3zpD3DJnaa	How can we feel closer to unreal/imaginary gods/goddesses?|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings, I have felt closest to God since I was a  small child, as I grew older i learn to depend on Him for every thing in my life, not because He is  our father and healer, but just because He is the God that loves us and really care about all of His chidren's and every thing that He  created. The closest that  I felt His present, was when i gave birth to my daughter, and i had some complications, and i heard the Doctors said, they were loosing me, i saw a vision of the lord appear and disappear, then they could finally hear me speaking, although i heard and saw every thing, that was happening, The Doctors just couldn't hear me, and this after i couldn't understand what really happen until this day, i felt warm all over for couple of day, every thing that was wrong when away, And now each time i have a problem, if i am sick, sad happy, depress,  angry etc, i feel closer to my heavenly father and i give Him all of my burden.....If you want to have a closer relationship with God, you must spend time with Him. You have to listen to Him. You need to praise Him for what He's done. You must worship Him for who He is and be grateful in every situation. This is how your relationship with God will grow and become more intimate.....The same is true for you, as a Believer. You can not only experience God as Daddy but as friend. You can share your most intimate secrets and feelings with Him, and He will never turn you away. He will never abandon you (Hebrews 13:5). There is nothing that you can say or do that will cause Him to stop loving you. He won't be shocked or surprised ....... We must pray to the Father in Jesus' Name (John 15:16) and pray according to God's Will, the Bible (1 John 5:14). Other than that, prayer is just talking to God....I make time every morning to fellowship with God. I speak His Word over my life, over my  two children grand children   and friends  and other love ones.           I pray and read the Word. Then I take Him with me throughout my day. I talk to Him  again     when I have a problem, when I am frustrated,  whatever.    However, I make special time to listen to what He has to say. I learned early on that God speaks to me in different   places,at home, in restaurants or whatever facilities I am in. It is our special place. It is where I listen to what He is speaking to my spirit, but it took practice to hear Him well.    Not only do you need to talk to God, but you need to listen as well. Then you will know what is on God's heart concerning you. Through your communication, your conversations with him, you will get to know Him better. Then your relationship with Him won't seem so one-sided.     Another way to become more intimate with God is through your praise, worship and thanksgiving........

For that one doesn't have to be a member of any organization.    At the same time,  it is good to interact with people who share your beliefs and help clear your doubts.  If we are a member, as many of us are,  it helps to really know what the true essence of teachings is...rather than blindly following the diktats,  to conform.

So God is a concept. The concpt won't work for you if you believe in HIM with half heart, But it will move mountains for you  (this is the greatest thing) if you belive in HIM 100%.  If jesus can become GOD just because he was full of love the why can't I, same is the case with BUDDHA, and KRISHNA.    Look dude...religion is just like banana skin and spirituality is the banana.  You have to throw the banana peel away one you get teh banaan.  So when you understand the concept of God, believe me you remain not a christian...you become divine.  Indian spirituality has something to offer to the world.    peace.|`|ztJW7HUxaa	All religions basically exhort mankind to be righteous and eschew evil. But Islam goes beyond that. It guides us towards practical ways of achieving righteousness and eliminating evil from our individual and collective lives. Islam takes into account human nature and the complexities of human society. Islam is guidance from the Creator Himself. Therefore, Islam is also called the Deen-ul-Fitrah (the natural religion of Man).    Islam prescribes method of eliminating robbery  All major religions teach that theft is an evil act. Islam teaches the same. So what is the difference between Islam and the other religions? The difference lies in the fact that Islam, besides teaching that robbing is evil, shows a practical way of creating a social structure in which people will not rob.    Islam prescribes Zakaat   Islam prescribes a system of Zakaat (obligatory annual charity). Islamic law prescribes that every person who has a saving that exceeds the nisaab level i.e. more than 85 grams of gold, should give 2.5% of that saving every lunar year in charity. If every rich person in the world gave Zakaat sincerely, poverty will be eradicated from this world. Not a single human being would die of hunger.     Chopping off the hands as punishment for robbery  Islam prescribes chopping off the hands of the convicted robber. The Glorious Quran says in Surah Maidah:  "As to the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands:a punishment by way  of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power, full of wisdom."                            [ Al-Quran 5:38]  The non-Muslim may say, "Chopping off the hands in this 20th century. Islam is a barbaric and ruthless religion!"    Results achieved when Islamic Shariah Implemented  America is supposed to be one of the most advanced countries in the world. Unfortunately it also has one of the highest rates of crime, theft, and robbery. Suppose the Islamic shariah is implemented in America i.e. every rich person gives Zakaat ( 2.5% of his savings in charity above 85 grams of gold every lunar year), and every convicted robber has his or her hands chopped off as a punishment. Will the rate of theft and robbery in America increase, remain same or decrease? Naturally it will decrease. Moreover the existence of such a stringent law would discourage many a potential robber.     I agree that the amount of theft that takes place in the world today is so tremendous that if you chop off the hands of all the thieves, there will be tens of thousands of people whose hands will be chopped off. The point here is that the moment you implement this law the rate of theft will decline immediately. The potential robber would give it a serious thought before jeopardizing his limbs. The mere thought of the punishment itself will discourage majority of the robbers. There will barely be a few who would rob. Hence only a few persons hands would be chopped off but millions would live peacefully without fear of being robbed.    Islamic Shariah is therefore practical, and achieves results.    Islam prescribes method of eliminating molestation and rape  All the major religions declare the molestation and rape of women as grave sins. Islam teaches the same. What then is the difference between Islam and the other religions? The difference lies in the fact that Islam does not merely preach respect for women, or abhor molestation and rape as serious crimes, but also gives clear guidance as to how society can eliminate such crimes.      Hijaab for men  Islam has a system of hijaab. The Glorious Quran first mentions hijaab for the men and then for the women. Hijaab for the men is mentioned in the following verse:  "Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do."                          [Al-Quran 24:30]    The moment a man looks at a woman and if any brazen or unashamed thought comes to his mind, he should lower his gaze.    Hijaab for women  Hijaab for women is mentioned in the following verse:  "And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons...."                              [Al-Quran 24:31]     The extent of hijaab for a woman is that her complete body should be covered. The only part that can be seen, are the face and the hands up to the wrists. If they wish to cover, they can even cover these parts of the body. However some Islamic scholars insist that even the face should be covered.    Hijaab prevents molestation  The reason why Allah has prescribed Hijaab for the women is given in the Quran in the folowing verse of Surah Al-Ahzab:  "O Prophet! Tell thy wives|`|wEQdPMmSaa	God has created humans for the sole reason to worship Him. You are not obliged to form part of an organisation to worship God.

IZJYCYkoaa	Yes.  abortion is a sin.     "For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mothers womb.I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.Wonderful are your works;my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you,when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.Your eyes saw my unformed substance;in your  book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them." Psalm 139:13-16     We are told that God knows us and sees us before we are ever born. Each of us, before we are completely formed physically, is a living soul that is special to God.    Those who favour abortion talk about the rights and freedoms of the mother, but what about your baby's right to life?    Abortion is not an easy way out of an embarrassing or difficult situation. It will leave a lifetime of heartache and scars. Do not break God's laws-- it will only break you.    Life is precious to God - yours and your baby's. If you have already had an abortion, then know your baby is in heaven now. God can forgive you and cleanse you of the guilt and shame you feel.

This depend only on what you believe in, if you are a Christian and believe in God, then yes abortion  is a sin and murder, and it is breaking God law. Even if you believe or not, this is a women-choice,  If it is a life threaten situation, sickness or  medical  problem  them, the women alone decide if she wants to do this, i am speaking for my self  alone,  I am not been judge mental God's is our only judge. But i know, i don't think i will want to do this. And this is the reason.........When does a person become a person? When does abortion become murder? The answers: at conception and it is almost always is murder. Let's look at scripture.    There are a number of passages in Scripture that deal with the concept of when life becomes life, and the point at which God created that life. Let's look at these and the objections someone who favors killing babies has raised.    Medical science has long known, and clearly demonstrated, that a baby in the womb is a living person that feels pain, reacts to stimulus, and is completely unique person. The Bible also shows this:    "When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb..." - Luke 1:41    "For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my eyes, the baby leaped in my womb for joy." - Luke 1:44    By the way, the Bible always refers to an unborn child as a baby. The term "fetus" is never used. Whether the person is inside or outside of the womb, the same term is used, "baby".    Of course, someone might say this was a very special baby. This was Jesus. This is a special case, it is not something that applies to everyone. I'd then have to ask, what makes it a special case? Could it be that Jesus, as a baby in the womb, understood Mary's words because he is God?    A verse that tells us God formed us in the womb is Jeremiah 1:5.    "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you, I have appointed you a prophet to the nations." - Jeremiah 1:5    Galatians says the same thing about Paul, "But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb..." - Galatians 1:15    The objection is that this is a special case. That Jeremiah was created to be a prophet and so he received God's special attention and was formed in the womb by God. However, this does not apply to everyone else. We are not prophets like Jeremiah and Paul.    Yes, that one statement is true. We are not all prophets. The verse goes on to say God consecrated Jeremiah before he was born and appointed him to be a prophet. That certainly is very special. But, does it negate the first part of this verse? Does God only form prophets in the womb, or does He form everyone in the womb?    From a plain, straightforward reading of the text it is so obvious that God forms everyone in the womb, that I can not find one commentary that questions this or even discusses it.    Let's go to Psalm 139:13    "For You [God] formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb."    This verse clearly says David was formed by God in his mother's womb, and the person defending child murder says nothing about this verse, other than claiming it will be used to support life.    What is the context of this verse?    The previous paragraphs are talking about how God is everywhere. Starting in 139:13 scripture talks about God's power and skill, and it uses the beginning of life as an example. Not only do these verses say God made us in the womb, they praise God for His skill.    What is also interesting is Psalm 51:5 - "Behold I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me."    What is the context? In the previous verses David is talking about his sin and how evil he is in God's sight. These verses are all about David being a sinner, from the moment he was conceived.    Can a blob of tissue sin? No. Can an animal sin? No. Only a person, created by God, can sin. Only a living being created in the image of God can sin against God. Psalm 51:5 clearly states that from the moment of conception a baby is a person... we all know that killing a person is murder.|`|mFGyonmTaa	It depends whether you are pro-life or not...

I believe that it is wrong to end a pregnancy out of convenience alone. It also depends on whether the conception was out of sin; i.e. rape or incest. It is up to the community to deter women from needing abortions through family education and assistance.|`|2K2QyLJCaa	I'll answer your question with a question?    Which is worse? To destroy the body or to destroy the soul?    Pro-lifers make a big to do about destroying the body through abortion, but what about the children that are brought into this world only to be destroyed mentally and emotionally by parents that are ill-equipped to raise these children, resulting in the incompleted development (abortion) of the soul?    The life of the body begins at conception, but the life of the soul begins with the infant takes its first breath through its nostrils!    " And the Lord God formed man... and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."|`|qgMnPuBpaa	my roomate just had an abortion, she had been doing drugs at the time she became pregnant and she was thinking about keeping the kid, but what she wasnt thinking about was her baby. Her baby growing inside could have already been damaged by the drugs she was using and it was most likley that the baby was going to be deformed or disabled so she had an abortion. This was no sin at all, why let the kid suffer a life of misery? If you donnot want childrem, use birth control, its as simple as that|`|MyLsLugGaa	its a sin unless if avoided may leads to critical condition of the female|`|HYOQfHbWaa	A spiritual teacher has said that when a fetus/body is aborted, the soul that is supposed to occupy the body has not entered the body yet. Only when the baby draws its first breath after being born, does the soul enter or come into the body. The fetus is actually just like a biological robot in the mother's womb. If a fetus is aborted, then the soul which wanted to be incarnated chooses some other channel (parents) to be born. So abortion is not a murder at all. If the parents are absolutely in a position where they cannot bring up a child then it is better to abort. It is not a sin. People should only choose to be parents when they are ready to love and care for babies and know what it means to be parents, and they can take the enormous responsibility that parenting is.|`|ztJW7HUxaa	There are fundamentally two methods of Contraception or family planning.  (1) Permanent methods.  (2) Temporary methods   (1) Permanent Methods: Permanent methods include, Vasectomy in males and Tubecotomy in females. All the scholars unanimously agree that permanent methods of family planning are prohibited since they involve changing human physiology. Says Allah in the Quran:     So set you your face steadily and truly to the Faith: (Establish) Allahs handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made humankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not. (Al-Quran 30:30)    The Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said: Marry the one who is loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations [i.e., on the Day of Resurrection]. (Abu Dawood Hadith no. 2050, Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1805)     (2) Temporary Methods: Following are various different temporary methods.     a) M.T.P. (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) or Abortion: All scholars unanimously agree that M.T.P. or abortion is prohibited. Allah says in the Glorious Quran     ...kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them; (Al-Quran 6:151)     Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you: verily the killing of them is a great sin. (Al-Quran 17:31)     However, scholars unanimously agree that any permanent method of family planning, or even abortion, can be done if the life of the mother is in danger. For e.g. if the woman is suffering from certain diseases like heart disease or has under gone multiple caesarean operations and in her case the continuation of pregnancy or another pregnancy may be detrimental to her life, then the woman can be aborted or a permanent method of family planning can be adopted to save the life of the woman.     b) Taking birth control pills: Almost all the scholars including Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Council of the Senior Scholars [of Saudi Arabia] agree that it is not allowed to take birth control pills (Fataawa al-Marah) because of its side effects and changes in the normal physiology.     c) Copper-T: A very common temporary method of family planning or contraception is Copper-T. Though it is known as contraception but technically it is contra-implantation. The sperm fertilizes the ovum but the zygote formed is destroyed by the Copper-T and is prevented from being implanted on the uterine wall (mothers womb). Thus it is a very early abortion, which is prohibited in Islam.     Some scholars out of ignorance permit this temporary method of family planning without knowing its detail.     d) Coitus Interruptus (Azl): Coitus Interruptus is permissible as long as it is performed with mutual consent of both the husband and wife since both of them have equal right to have children.     This is based on the Hadith of Jabir (RA) who said: We used to practice (Azl) coitus interruptus during the days when the Quran was being revealed.     Jabir added: We used to practice coitus interruptus during the lifetime of Allahs Messenger while the Quran was being revealed. (Sahih Bukhari vol. 7, Hadith no. 136) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:     With regard to azl, some of the scholars regarded it as haraam, but the view of the four imams is that it is permissible with the wifes permission. And Allah nows best. (Majmoo al-Fataawa, 32/110)     e) As regarding other temporary ethods of family planning like condom etc., the scholars are divided whether their use is permitted or not. Allah (swt) has provided a natural method of planning the family, which is medically known as lactation amenorrhea. After the women gives birth to a child, till she breast feeds she does not have her menstrual cycle, thus the chances of pregnancy in this period of lactation is minimal.     Allah says in the Quran The mothers shall give suck to their offspring for two whole years... (Al-Quran 2:233)     Reasons for Family Planning: All the various reasons for family planning can be divided into two categories:  1. Either for poverty or 2. Giving special attention to children by having fewer children. As for those who are poor and fear that they will not be able to meet the economic expenses of the additional child, Allah (swt) has prescribed the system of zakaat. Every rich person who has the savings of more than the nisab level i.e. 85 gms of gold, should give 2.5% of his excess wealth every lunar year in charity. Those who are poor have the right to take the zakaat money. Allah (swt) says in the Quran ...Kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them; (Al-Quran 6:151) Allah (swt) also mentions in the Quran     Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you: verily the killing of them is a great sin.

They were not under the "old covenant".     To answer your question, 2 Corinthians 3 is not talking about not needing to obey the 4th commandment anymore. It was talking about how the people would have a "veil" on their face when being read Moses because they could not make the connection between the things of the OT leading up to Christ. They would just see the OT standing by itself, without Christ, which would be pointless.   Also, it was mentioning how God's Law is now written upon our hearts, instead of upon tables of stone. The Law is still there, but just in our hearts now. As Christians, we are still expected to obey the 10 Commandments. Also, if Christ had intended to remove or change the 4th commandment (which is part of God's character, which NEVER changes), don't you think He would have said something in the Gospels about something so huge?   We are not in the "old covenant" by keeping the Sabbath. That is part of God's unchanging Law. Those who are in the "old covenant" are those who still keep the new moons, feasts and YEARLY sabbaths (not the weekly one) or who still sacrifice animals for the atonement of sins. Those rituals all pointed FORWARD in the OT to Christ's first coming, but now that He has come, He has fulfilled them, so they are no longer necessary. Basically, any law written by Moses would be the "old covenant". But the 10 Commandments were not written by Moses. They were written by God's own finger, and have existed since Creation. They were only written on stone at Mt. Sinai.     The seventh-day Sabbath always has been and always will be God's special day that He blessed and sanctified forever. How could you possibly think that the counterfeit sabbath, a pagan holy day, would be a replacement for that? Or that God would even authorize such a change?|`|LJlaHLQdaa	The Veil of Unbelief.--     [2 Cor. 3:12-15] The Jews refused to accept Christ as the Messiah, and they cannot see that their ceremonies are meaningless, that the sacrifices and offerings have lost their significance. The veil drawn by themselves in stubborn unbelief is still before their minds. It would be removed if they would accept Christ, the righteousness of the law.          Many in the Christian world also have a veil before their eyes and heart. They do not see to the end of that which was done away. They do not see that it was only the ceremonial law which was abrogated at the death of Christ. They claim that the moral law was nailed to the cross. Heavy is the veil that darkens their understanding. The hearts of many are at war with God. They are not subject to His law. Only as they shall come into harmony with the rule of His government can Christ be of any avail to them. They may talk of Christ as their Saviour; but He will finally say to them, I know you not. You have not exercised genuine repentance toward God for the transgression of His holy law, and you cannot have genuine faith in Me, for it was My mission to exalt God's law.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	Many Christians are confused by the fact they do not understand the dispensations in the Bible.    I am a dispensationalist .  I do believe that God has worked differently in the various periods of time which I would call an economy.  My biblical convictions are opposed to the interpretation of the Bible that covenant theology holds.  Their covenant of works seems to be a system that is not derived from the Bible (eisogesis) but is forced upon the Bible.  Dispensationalism  is a system of interpreting the Bible that naturally derives from the Scripture (exegesis).    There is a dispensation of innocency.  Adam and Eve did not know sin and that makes that period of time unique in history.  Adam was created not only innocent but in a state of holiness because he could have a direct fellowship with God (Gen. 3:8).    Secondly, I believe there is a dispensation of conscience (Gen. 4:1-8:14).  This was the chief way that God worked in that period of time.  Also, this does not mean that man (Adam) didn't have a conscience before this period of time.  The third dispensation is known as the dispensation of Civil Government.  Noah is the principle person of this era (Gen. 8:15-11:9).  It is at this time that captal punishment is established.    The fourth dispensation is called the dispensation of promise (Gen. 11:10-Ex. 18:27).  The primary person of this dispensation is Abraham who is given the promise of a future land and promised heir.  Next comes the dispensation of Law with the primary person of Moses.  This is not just the giving of the ten commandments but the 613 laws and statures given by God to Israel.    The sixth dispensation is referred to as the dispensation of grace which covers the time of the church from Acts 2 to the time of the rapture.  Finally, the seventh dispensation is the dispensation of the Millennium.  This will be the time after the 2nd coming when Jesus Christ will rule and reign from Jerusalem for 1000 years.  It will be followed by the creation of a new heaven and earth.    If people would only let the Scriptures teach them, there would not be so much confusion and division amongst the brethren and we would all come to the same conclusions.    I pray this sheds some light and gives glory and honor to God.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	4|`|wT9PTRgtaa	jesus was crucified on wednesday afternoon,passover day.On saturday afternoon he was resurrected.remember what angel said to women who came to look for jesus on early sunday morning-he is not here,he has ressurected.if this was not so god will be liar when he said only sign given to this generation will be sign of jonah.(that is like jonah son of man will be inside earth for three days and three nights)you can see traditional good friday observence and sunday christianity of catholics are plain heresy.(that is why most nations today consider sunday as the seventh day).true religion -religion of christ is the fusion of melchizedek and levite priesthood.historians have confirmed early christians observed god's calendar-not the modern jewish one,and kept sabbath and high sabbath days which god commanded israelites and all their descendents(church is a part of israel) to observe forever.when constantine made christianity a roman religion,many people without proper knowledge of god,brought their pagan customs(praying to saints/using images/statues to pray).This was a fulfillment of paul's prophecy that at a later time church would be corrupted.but christ has said his church will not be overcome by gates of hell.it means church will overcome the corruption that entered it,by purging away pagan practices.god's word also tells in the end times he will send his spirit upon all flesh-means all people on earth will be members of god's church.|`|9J8ciEwWaa	hogie   You say you ask Sabbath keepers why we keep the law of Moses but this is not the same thing as the law of God!    We have repeatedly explained to you despite the fact you block us, and therefore we connot discuss this until we are challenged by you on R&S. Let me try once again to make this clear ,   We are not saved by any works or by keeping the law!  Please please stop labelling us as legalistic when we are consistant with our replies that we are ONLY saved by the grace of our Lord through His death on the cross,and accepting this by faith we have salvation by no other means.   Now,   The law of Moses were the laws pertaining to the sacrifices that symbolized the messiahs death, the laws which determined dress codes when to bathe when to sacrifice which animals for which sins , these are the laws which christ fulfilled and which Paul stated were nailed to the cross and which we are no longer a party to. This was the old covernant , this is fulfilled .  The 10 commandments were not laws of Moses! They were even written in the heart of the believer from creation onwards and at Sinai God wrote then down on stone because the Israelites had forgotten their heritage and it took 40 years to be reminded but anyway this law is the law of God, and as got air said not one jot or tittle will pass from the law! Nothing will become obsolete from the law of God it is the reminder we are sinners that we need a Saviour and because we love Him we should endeavor to follow His commands that also includes honouring our parents having respect for life not taking Gods name in vain . . All the 10 are alive today in peoples hearts and the 4th commandment was the one which we are asked to remember . Why ? Because God knew it would be attacked as His signature day of rest.   Please please can you not plainly see this ? Its as easy as 9+1|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Early Christians didn't begin to abandon the observance of Shabbat until 135 CE, and even then it was only in Rome and Alexandria. Other communities, where tensions between Rome weren't quite so complex, retained Shabbat observance longer, some until the 5th century.    Clearly Paul wasn't forbidding it.    These are historical truths. Your questions don't fit with what happened.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	The ones with the veil over their hearts have their minds hardened and will not listen to Moses when the Torah of YHVH is read to them:    2 Cor 3:14  But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ.  2 Cor 3:15  But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart;  2 Cor 3:16  but whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.    Over and over again and again in the Hebrew "Old" Testament the Law of YHVH given through Moses is read instructing His people to keep the Sabbath.    The veil remains because their minds are "hardened", they still do not hear the message to keep the commandments. Only in Messiah is the veil taken away in order to hear the commandments of YHVH given through His servant Moses and observe His Sabbaths.    Forever is a long time to believe in Moses:    Exo 19:9  And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I shall come to you in a thick cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe in you forever." Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.    We cannot hang our salvation and relationship with God upon Paul's misunderstood letters alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mounth of God:    Mat 4:4  But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.      Are we to live by what a mistranslated Paul says or by what God says?    Exo 20:1  Then God spoke all these words, saying, ...    Exo 20:8  "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  Exo 20:9  "Six days you shall labor and do all your work,  Exo 20:10  but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD ...        BTW     2 Cor 3:13  And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:    The word "end" is the Greek word telos which is also translated as "aim" or "goal". They were to look toward the goal of the Torah and keep the commandments. If the commandments of God were to be kept forever then who abolished them, man or God? Nowhere in the Bible did God say He will abolish His Law, man has and continues to reject it and in context abolished it.    2 Ki 17:37  "And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment, which He wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever; and you shall not fear other gods.    Num 15:16  One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	the veil is pagans and UNbelievers...    we all know that for 2000 yrs Christians have gone on sunday...

Rather than writing the laws in stone, God is now going to write them in our hearts. Jesus said that until heaven and earth pass away not one jot nor one title of the law would change. Based on that, I believe the laws that God is writing in our hearts are the same laws that were written in stone which would include the 4th commandment. You certainly aren't saying it is now ok to murder, commit adultery, lie, steal, etc., are you?

The supervisor who made a fuss didn't even consider it offensive, she just thought that others in another situation might be offended. That's a euphamism for saying "I can find nothing wrong with what you offered to do, but I'm intent on picking fault". I think the judgement tells us more about the supervisor than anything. She's not the sort of person it would be good to work for.  As far as I know nobody of any other faith is ever likely to be offended by an offer to pray, nor would a Christian be offended by anybody of another faith offering to pray. The most sensitive people on this sort of issue are devout atheists. Most people without faith aren't atheists though & won't be offended. It's only a very tiny minority but unfortunately they don't have any fall back position or resource in the same way agnostics & people of faith do. So they tend to be oversensitive compared to the rest of the population.

"By canonizing some of the faithful, i.e., by solemnly proclaiming that they practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to God's grace, the Church recognizes the power of the Spirit of holiness within her and sustains the hope of believers by proposing the saints to them as models and intercessors."

The first canonization of a Saint occurred in the year 993 when Pope John XV declared Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg a saint.  Before that time, Saints were elevated through popular opinion and were usually considered to be those who died (were martyred) for their faith.  There's no authoritative number of known Saints.

The reason is, if time has passed and it STILL affects you, then you have been emotionally traumatized.    People SUE over things like this, things much more trivial.    The very least you can do is get some closure.    It might not be easy to accomplish.    Me, if I listed all the people that hurt me bad it would be roughly a 1,000 page website.    Because of the complexities of working that out, I opted instead to just lump everyone I encounter in the same boat as being harmful unless proven otherwise.

What about the home of one of your parents?  What about the cafeteria in an airport or bus station or mall?    Can't you work together online?  I often do that with a colleague.|`|mxixfE3Raa	It is forbidden in islam for adult female(aged 9 & above)/male (aged 13 & above) to be in the same room alone even if they are studying. The reason for this is that although they are doing a seemingly innocent & lawful activity ie school homework; it may lead to feelings & emotions being aroused which are unlawful in islamic teachings.     I therefore recommend  you cease to be studing with a member of the opposite sex immediately & choose to find a study partner of the same gender as yourself.

AA11872632	It's no wonder these days.  I see TEACHERS that don't know the difference between English verb tenses.  Teachers that give bad examples to their students, and just make up gibberish English rules, when they really don't know the answer.  Example from a so-called "teacher", right here on YAHOO:  "He had spoken" is the preterite tense, which implies that the action has ceased.  ...(pure gibberish. it is the past perfect, and action that ceased before another.)    Do you know whom I am talking about?|`|g54tGcRvaa	Is it still a language if you remove any semblance of grammar?  Yes, it just doesn't deserve to be called English.

The way people talk is the language.  Language is not prescribed, it is not defined and then imposed on people.  People talk, and the way they talk is the language.      On the other hand, there are a lot of stupid people in the world.    So, no, we are not losing the ability to speak English in America, but there are a lot of people who don't know what they are saying.    What's causing the changes that you consider to be breakdowns?  Well, there is the aformentioned stupidity for one thing.  Since speaking is a way of communicating thoughts, when people can't think very well, then they can't speak very well.    It's natural that English is going through a lot of change right now because of the very large changes in culture, diversity, means of communication, new media, and so on.  The postmodern condition includes the erasure of stories that the community as a whole once believed.  There is no more monoculture; nothing is more real or more true than anything else in this jambalaya of cultures, ethnicity, religions, values, occupations, stories, and other sources of thought and language.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	They're building a new language for themselves different from the English spoke originally in England.

My pet peeve of the moment.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	the answer to your question seems to me to come from multi levels.    1st let me say that if you cannot speak the language, get the hell out of my beloved country.    Next, congress has failed to make english the official language of our country.  This leads to a break down not only in what language to speak, but also how to speak it.  It leads to a break down in our educational system in how to properly teach and then hold the student accountable for learning.    There is family breakdown running rampant.  With the need to have 2 income families, more and more kids have less and less contact with both parents because they are busy being wrapped in in their jobs.  Therefore, parents are unable to hold their kids accountable.  This leads to a break down in respect.  If people have little to no respect for themselves, then they are not going to care about how they speak and represent themselves.|`|cSm2YOZcaa	I think it may be how languages change and grow.  English is not the same as it was 100 years ago, and it certainly will not be the same 100 years from now.  Language is not an unchanging thing.  So yes, people do make grammar mistakes all of the time, and words and phrases get switched around, but without all of that, the language may never have become what it is today.    Just a thought.  However, I get irritated by bad spellers, so I really shouldn't talking! :)

It is not the person but the performance that is to be condemned.  By the same token I do not condone premarital or extramarital sexual practices.  I would not let my unmarried son live in my house with his girlfriend because that is contrary to our moral standards.  I love my son and they are now married and are a great little family.    I encourage all to live moral lives according to the standards established by God.  If we are tempted to do otherwise, it is up to the individual to refrain from following that temptation.  We are to be totally chaste before marriage and complete faithful after marriage.  Any sexual activity other than that, homo or hetero, is forbidden.  It is that simple.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	I don't have a problem with homosexuals.|`|47sALOGfaa	Yes, but only the cultists claim their condemnation is divinely inspired and therefore unquestionably right.

Christianity has made a point to focus on homosexuality. The religious texts have purposely been mistranslated and corrupted to support a false ideal about gay people. The reality is, gay people are not really mentioned in the Bible, until Paul and Peter. And, even then, many of those are also mistranslations. Confusing male religious prostitutes for all gay people.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Cannot fix this problem, or any problem in relation to anything that is a part of this world. Homosexuality is a sickness of the mind, it is of the devil as we must know that to fight HIM is only to give the word to the people who will receive it.     The trick of the devil is to derail the Christian so that they are preoccupied with the lesser things than with the focal point, which is , to love them as we love ourselves yet remain steadfast in what we believe. Most of all prayer is our weapon of warfare and our daily walk with him as seen by other people.    Be of good cheer! You are of the kingdom of heaven! God will call them as well, but like all of us, they must overcome the flesh.

If you change your statement, "...if one eliminated all christians from this world..." to "...if one eliminated all monotheistic religions from this world..." they you'd find your statement to be absolutely false.  The condemnation of homosexuality comes almost entirely from monotheistic religions whose superstitious dogma tells them it's bad, and who can't think for themselves.    I'd challenge you to find ONE person who does not believe in god that would make a public statement condemning homosexuals.  Just one.    Go ahead -- try...  I've never met one.  Every person I've ever met that doesn't believe in a made-up god doesn't care what other adults do in the privacy of their own bedrooms.

The fact is, many people use religion as a comfortable excuse to justify bigotry. I knew this long before you and I ever conversed, so it's nothing personal. I just cannot see a loving God allowing gays to be born and then to to be tormented, and yet this God stays silent.  Some christians have gone so far as to tell gays of their attacks "You brought this on yourself".    If you are not trying to actively eliminate gays from society on the presupposition that gays are abominable, you are not following the bible literally.And that's the problem with religious adherence.    No, most straights do not understand gays, but anyone who has a gay friend or family member is always allowing of gay marriage,including Dick Cheney. Why? Because they know the scapegoating is wrong.    As long as the United States continues to have the highest rates of divorce and teen pregnancy in the industrialized world, its gay marriage bans are,in fact, an abomination.

Saying other people are mean to gays too doesn't excuse any Christians from being cruel or condemning gay people. They have less excuse than anybody, because they are commanded to love everyone.

He talks very fondly about Sodom and Gomorrah.  In fact, he said that in the Day of Judgment the Sodomites will fare much better than the Jews! Dig this Jesus is going to judge everybody and he is ALREADY telling us the outcome of the proceedings in his Holy Court! No other judge in the world is so candid!       Matthew 11:24 (NIV) But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you."*    (*) Jesus is demonstrating to have much more love and favoritism for the gays and Lesbians than for his own people the Jews! He also stated that even the PROSTITUTES* (*not ex-prostitutes, but prostitutes!) will enter his Kingdom ahead of the Jews!!! So if you have a choice of favoring a gay person or a Jew, which one would you choose??? WWJD?    God the Son Jesus Christ* (*the future Judge of the World) doesnt see anything wicked in Sodom, except the normal everyday life routine  Bear in mind that Jesus is the sole heir of the Universe The old man God will kick the bucket someday and Jesus will take over    Luke 17:28-29 (NIV)  It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.* (*God the Son Jesus Christ doesn't mention homosexuality as the sin of Sodom, but carefree living!!! Nobody beats Jesus at judging anybody!)    There are unfulfilled prophecies in the Old Testament about the full restoration of Sodom and Gomorrah to the state that they were just before their destruction!!!    Ezekiel 16:48-49,53,55 (NIV) As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you* (*Jerusalem! Most Christians refuse to agree with God, but according to the Bible writers JERUSALEM IS MUCH MORE SINFUL THAN SODOM...!!) and your daughters have done. Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy...* (*Neither God the Father nor Jesus Christ EVER MENTIONED THAT THE SIN OF SODOM was homosexuality, but God hated their carefree living and so he had to destroy Sodom! Jesus said the same thing about Sodom Mat 10:15, 11:24, Mar 6:11. Luc 10:12) [53] "However, I* (*God) will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them [55] And your sisters, SODOM WITH HER DAUGHTERS and Samaria with her daughters, WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before* (*the destruction of Sodom was a mistake that only homophobic Christians refuse to accept!)     Christians are determined to prevent God from fulfilling prophecies that they dont like and this is one of them! God the Son Jesus Christ said that the PROSTITUTES* (*not ex-prostitutes, but prostitutes!) will enter his Kingdom ahead of the Jews!!! (The Jews don't mind as long as they are there when they get there!) So if you have a choice to favor a prostitute or a Jew, which one would you choose??? Hint: WWJD?    What if we had male prostitutes like the ones who were servicing the LORDS people in Solomons Temple? King Solomon built shrines for male and female prostitutes right inside of the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem and all around Israel! They were fully functional for over 300 Bible years until a new king Josiah removed them!!! King Solomon holds Gods certification of being the wisest man ever to set foot on this Earth which is something more that you can possibly say about your favorite preacher today!!!     2 kings 23:7 (NIV) He* (*King Josiah) also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes* (*male shrine prostitutes were homosexuals making a decent living servicing God's people in a way that Christians wouldn't approve today!), which were in the temple of the LORD     BTW, God was not impressed with King Josiahs reforms. The Jews ended up in captivity and Jerusalem was totally destroyed anyway. Bear in mind that for over 700 Bible years NOBODY ever saw or read the Tablets of the Law of God that GOD HIMSELF WROTE WITH HIS OWN FINGER and Moses hid in the Ark of the Covenant as a witness against Israel! Anybody peeking inside the Ark was zapped on the spot! There is nothing in the tablets of the Law against homosexuality! There is no proof that the tablets were ever seen, either if they ever existed at all so nobody knew the 10 commandments or any other Law of God or Moses for over 700 Bible years!!!    The ONLY place of worship authorized by the Bible God was in his Temple in Jerusalem that was built by King Solomon. Can you picture in your mind the most conservative clergypersons, preachers and their families and children going to worship God in the Temple of the LORD while at the same time male prostitutes are servicing the rest of the male congregation!?  But that is the way it was back then!!! You didnt have to go to a public sh*t house to show hard you went to the Temple of the LORD! Its all in the Bible!  Like the old time spiritual goes    "?? Those were the days???, my friend...???"|`|knOdcrDkaa	I didn't realize they needed my permission for anything.  At any rate, I wholeheartedly accept my gay brothers and sisters.

It's mean and stupid and a good reason why I'm not Christian. You can't help the way you're born. And if God didn't want people to be gay then why make them gay?I thought everyone was part of his plan!!!|`|DHwTtPSEaa	Personally homosexuality is not right nor is it right in Christianity. And i support Both.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	No     let those without sin cast the first stone.      and I'm an atheist.    and don't kid yourself. its the christian community that keeps equal rights for homosexuals off the books.     such a simple concept, let those without sin..., yet the catholics can't even get that right. so sad.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	The issue is that it's only the religious institutions that actually have the arrogance to attempt to make policy limiting the RIGHTS of homosexuals. Yes, anyone can be homophobic, racist, sexist, bigoted etc. but only organizations have the power and resources to put their bigotry into action and affect policy. As soon as Christians cease their attempt to force their belief system onto our laws and our society, we'll stop accusing them of being the main force for hatred and intolerance when it comes to sexuality.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	While it's true that religious beliefs aren't necessary to condemn a group of people, they tend to promote a xenophobic "us versus them" mentality and a narrow interpretation of "right and wrong", which often leads to unwarranted discrimination.  Non-religious people aren't predisposed to that characteristic, so it is less common in them.|`|1757d3a103d979c710a9780f556edb22aa	I do not condone homosexual activity, however, I do not condemn the people; what they do with that part of their lives is not my business.  In the end, it's between them and God.|`|Om2xjC08aa	I have no problems with homosexuals (and I'm an Atheist)|`|U7Rh7KNSaa	The Lord destroyed a hole city ( Sodom&Gomorrah) and all the little cities around it because of homosexuality. It don't make sense to accept it. Remember Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever. So what do you think he feels about it in todays time?|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	I do not need to condone anything.  I am not king of the world such that everyone has to do my bidding.    As homosexuals do their own thing, without harming others, I have no reason to condemn them, nor can I find any reason to withold basic human rights from them.|`|PWankIUpaa	How can I condone it when the Holy and Inerrant Word of God dose not condone it!     God made all men to be men and women to be women! He condemns both sexes if they do not accept His judgments. While He condemns Homosexuals He also CONDEMNS Heterosexual Sex outside of Marriage!    So before you go throwing stones be sure that  you do not live in a Glass House ! You can lie to me but not to God!|`|mVsWyu0yaa	CACA DE TORO!!  1. It is not your place, or mine, to either condone or condemn homosexuals.     2. Only religious fanatics and homophobic bigots 'condemn' homosexuals.     3. There is nothing about gay men and women that needs to be fixed...What must be fixed is the ignorance and bigoted intolerance of homophobes. Do you have a solution for THAT, or are you simply part of the problem???|`|0IqeHVauaa	Do I have to usurp God's prerogative? Allah reserves the right to judge solely to his authority. I do not have to condemn or condone or approve any particular behavior  by anyone. I therefore have no opinions in this matter and I don't have to.|`|y05xZzwdaa	I have no problem with homosexuals. To each their own.   BUT what about procreation? How would the human race continue if all or the majority were homosexuals? I know it's impossible for that to happen, but isn't that one of our intended purposes, to pro create?|`|AA11188574	If you are a true christian you cannot hate any person.   (1 John 3:15) 15?Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer, and YOU know that no manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him.?.?.    (1 John 4:7-5:2) 7?Beloved ones, let us continue loving one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born from God and gains the knowledge of God. 8?He that does not love has not come to know God, because God is love. 9?By this the love of God was made manifest in our case, because God sent forth his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him. 10?The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent forth his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. 11?Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us, then we are ourselves under obligation to love one another. 12?At no time has anyone beheld God. If we continue loving one another, God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us. 13?By this we gain the knowledge that we are remaining in union with him and he in union with us, because he has imparted his spirit to us. 14?In addition, we ourselves have beheld and are bearing witness that the Father has sent forth his Son as Savior of the world. 15?Whoever makes the confession that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God remains in union with such one and he in union with God. 16?And we ourselves have come to know and have believed the love that God has in our case. God is love, and he that remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him. 17?This is how love has been made perfect with us, that we may have freeness of speech in the day of judgment, because, just as that one is, so are we ourselves in this world. 18?There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint. Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love. 19?As for us, we love, because he first loved us. 20?If anyone makes the statement: I love God, and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen. 21?And this commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God should be loving his brother also. 5?Everyone believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God, and everyone who loves the one that caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one. 2?By this we gain the knowledge that we are loving the children of God, when we are loving God and doing his commandments.?.?.    We cannot condone something God hates but we have no right to hate the person just the act. Our loyalty to God must come first in our lives.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	I have no problems with homos but the problem comes and exists b/c being gay is becoming mainstream and protrayed as being okay when its really not.  If a person is a homo that is a personal choice which i have no problem with, but when they want to get marriage rights there is a problem b/c here in america marrige is defines as a man and a woman and it sends the wrong signal out to kids.  I really love me big screen TV, does that mean we should change the laws so i can marry it?      Another thing is that in the 50s-60s-70s homos would keep it to them selves, they didnt need to bring it to every ones attention, now it seems like it is used like a "race card".  I dont think we should have let it become so main stream were our kids are being taught that being gay is ok.  Like i said its a pesonal choice, but its not something that should be flaunted as being perfectly normal.
AA11598520	Good question! No, I don't. My oldest younger brother and I don't feel the need to go to the cemetery  to visit my mother's grave because we don't think she's there. She's in heaven. My youngest brother and my dad, though, do go to the cemetery often because it helps them have a specific place to visit her.    Yes, I believe she's not only in my heart but in heaven and she watches over us. I have also had experiences with her even after her death.     I figure if it helps you to go to the cemetery, you should go, but sometimes I think my brother doesn't approve of us not needing to go. I think you should do what helps.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	Very important. Even though I don't go often, at times it is important.  That's why I don't care for scattering of cremated remains.  I think it's very unfair for family members who need a place to go.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	I do go. Not often but it is consistant. Not on Memorial day or such but to sit and spend some time there. I respected the choices of my parents and a friend I lost at fifteen. Just to show my respect for their choices to be buried.  They are in my heart and always by my side. I don't think it is necessary nor do I feel obligated beyond the time I set aside for them but I do feel that that time is spent in memory and allows me to reflect on my own life.  So yes it is important to me.  And differant for all.|`|AA10405438	I would never go.  I choose to remember the loved ones as they were.  They are in my heart and I can think of them when I want to without having to remember theri deaths over and over again.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	Death is simply a shedding of the physical body like the butterfly shedding its cocoon.

My grandmother was buried in the traditional way with a very nice headstone. I think I will request cremation, although I would prefer to be buried under a tree in the backyard. It is a very personal choice, but memories of the dead live on, no matter how their remains are dealt with. A star today for you in their memory.|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	My late wife is buried within 9 mile of where i live and i will be beside her some day. I bought 6 cemetery lots & have a dual tombstone with our names on it & room for 2 more on each side of us  . My wife now says she wants to be cremated as her late husband was. I can go to visit mine but my wife now has no where to visit . Sad to think about!|`|O9FojdEMaa	i think it is important to visit the grave and keep it neat it is a sign of love and respect and i agree they should be with you in your heart and mind also. as to whether they can hear me i have no proof they cannot.|`|R32J8Z4Yaa	I feel like they are in my heart wherever I am, but I also need to go to the cemetery sometimes.  I like to go and clean up, brush off the head stones, and bring seasonal flowers.  I like to read my parents names it makes me feel closer to them.  I know their soul is not there, but it feels good to speak to them and know their body is there.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	I used to think this was nonsense. Going to the cemetery. Until my father died. Now I go whenever time permits. Which is not often enough.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	I lost the love of my life almost 3 yrs. ago I didn't go to the funeral or view the body and have never been to his grave!!  I can't imagine him lying  in a casket or under the ground...but, he's in my heart every minute of the day!!!  I want to remember him in his 501 Levis, white western shirt and Stetson hat and tailor-made boots!!!|`|7fHsyHYraa	My husband and I have a child who was stillborn.  I seldom go to the place he is buried because it is in another state, many miles from here.  He is often in my thoughts and will always be close to my heart.  I don't feel that a visit to the cemetery is important but know many people find comfort when visiting a loved one's grave.  I know my father went to my mother's grave at least once every day.|`|AA11570788	I go visit my parents' graves as often as I can, even though they are buried in another state.  I put flowers on their graves as I sign of the love I have for them.  Nevertheless, I know they are with me and that their spirit is everywhere and it always will be.|`|Emk4xuTuaa	For Me, it is important to go to the grave site, even knowing that they are with me in my heart. I remember going to grave sites with my great grandmother and grandmas, and my parents to place flowers and clean  up the areas. They told me that, just because they are gone from this world- we still love them and it is a sign of respect to them, that we can take care of their final resting place.  And for me, I find it very peaceful to visit the sites.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	I never go tho the cemetery. I feel closer to my Mom and Dad  at home or anywhere else. They are only a thought away. I think of my Mom when I shop and there is a road my Dad used to love to drive down in the fall I take all the time.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I do visit cemeteries but oddly enough not to visit any graves of my loved ones.    They are embedded in my heart and memory, I do not visit their grave.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	Personally, I don't feel connected at the cemetery.  I respect how anyone wants to deal with their grief but for me the cemetery doesn't cut it.  My sister however spends a lot of time there talking to our parents.  I talk to them too , just not at the cemetery.|`|AA10353121	No grave-site for me, he is in beautiful box on the bedside table next to the American Flag.  I make comments to him often it makes me feel good.|`|1gsRGfJ1aa	I think loved ones are always in your heart and the memory of them will always be with you.  They live on through you and your children, grandchildren, etc.  I always feel their spirit is with me, guiding me on.  I don't feel a need to be where they are buried because I feel they are with me all the time.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	It was important to me the first few years, as pain grows less intense  visiting the cemetery, tapers off slowly, it's been over 11 years now  and my visits are seldom, As for the hearing you, if that is your belief,  the heart speaks echos of loves courage and strength never to be forgotten and move on, Only remains are in the ground, not the soul,  it has risen.|`|lebSL2yaaa	I visited my parents grave site maybe four times in 30 years.  The remains buried there are just that, remains.  Their soul is in heaven, and I can rejoice in that.  I don't care what the cemetery looks like, or if the grass is mowed.  I would rather visit my kids, in the land of the living.  My wife and I have decided that we will be cremated, and the ashes can go wherever the kids want, but not in a cemetery.  No headstone for us, either.  If our church develops a memorial garden, we might ask that the urns be placed it it, or the ashes sprinkled in it.|`|24vQ8D71aa	we all cope with grieving in our own personal way,it is up to each individual to do what's right for them.  i have only ever visited a grave side once , it felt empty and meaningless.   an object, scent,sight or sound often brings back memories .my loved ones are in my heart ,and stay with me forever.|`|JIATcwW6aa	No, for me it is not important.  I lost my mother last year and the second time I went to the cemetery, I couldn't find her.  It was so unnerving to me after wandering around forever, I felt the pain of her loss even more.      So I don't go back.  My brother feels the same way.      My mother isn't there and it just creeps me out to think of her body being in that box 6 feet under.  I've felt the same way about other loved ones I've lost as well.      I do sometimes feel as if they can hear and see me, but in a sense I also think that's part of what they left to me, sort of a conscience.      I'll either donate my body to science or I'll be cremated so my loved ones never have to deal with this.  Fortunately for me, my immediate family is all in agreement.|`|e76ca3a8a4fb4c384fdfa09fb1fd8582aa	I think that it's a good thing to do on special occasions. Like anniversary's or birthdays|`|g0gMQUCVaa	No.  For me, they aren't there.  That's where the "shell" is, not the soul.    Their soul is the person who I loved, will always love.  I pray for them, talk to them, miss them terribly but they aren't in the hole in the ground, nor in the urn on the shelf.|`|qIi7B3rRaa	Yes i do believe it is important.And i do also believe that they are in you hearts always.But i know for me if i get in the car and go to the grave of my parents after i leave i fell like i had a big get together.It is kind of like you went to there home and just talked and talked.When i leave i fill so much better than when i got there.I would so miss this if they had been cremated.|`|6xiwiiIzaa	That's what i said to my Dear Departed Mother when i moved 90 miles away , They are in your Heart wherever you are ,|`|ogLHkR0oaa	This is something that is up to each individual. Personally, I don't think that it matters, at the end of the day people who are dead are still with us in our hearts and our memories. I think that when life has left a body it is just an empty shell !|`|89d8b42fd2f09137ee437b1d438fa9a8aa	I celebrate their life ... not commemorate their death.  I constantly refresh the memories of the good times.  I wouldn't even look at the body in the casket. I didn't want that memory.   I have never gone back to the grave site.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	I think the other way..... I will be cremated  and scattered, because I don't want the kids to feel that they need to go to a gravesite and 'honor' me by cleaning up or placing flowers..... I'm nine hours drive away from where my mom is buried, and much as I'd like to keep her spot constantly in bloom and beautiful, I cannot.... and it breaks my heart... I don't want that for my family.... I'd rather they just keep me close in thoughts and hold me dear in their hearts, than to have them feel burdened or less than attentive if there was a 'spot' where they felt they had to go.... I'm in all the gardens around my  home.. in the decor of the house...in the knick-knacks in the curio....... if they want to 'visit', they only need to come home for a while....|`|b3h0ovgRaa	My mother's ashes were scattered over her mother's grave as she requested. There was no room in the family cemetery for her, so this is what I did. My father is buried almost 200 miles from where I live so I don't visit. I am not sure the dead can hear us. If there is another 'world' beyond the grave it would be in another dimension and not likely connected to our earthly world.  Poppy|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Different strokes for different folks. I do not personally visit graves of my departed loved ones because I believe strongly in the existence of the spirit world. I appreciate that their are people, many people, who need a place to identify the existence of someone that they loved who has crossed the great divide. These people need a cemetery and grave site to visit to connect. I visit a grave site when I am in the area usually. I have probably spent more time in cemetery's than the average person has.  I love to read inscriptions and to learn of the traditions displayed in cemetery's. Many objects are included in cemetery's because of traditions ages old. I have studied some of these and find them all very interesting. Sea Shells, Roses, Cedar Trees, Flowers, Children's Toys and many other objects all have a meaning or are symbolic.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	Resi, I don't feel I need to go to the cemetery to talk to my loved ones. I do think it is just their shell there and Their spirit is everywhere. I talked to the people I love who have died quite frequently where ever I am and know they are with and hear me.

8rbQBaIeaa	Maybe, but people do want to hear as well as see. The difference is...they want to hear..not to be preached at. A person who is a believer needs to be not only knowledgeable but  have a verse or scripture to back up why they said what they said. Saying that, remember the younger group likes to be taught with stories, not babble. Something they can relate too. Adults, well, it depends on their knowledge and education actually. Some or more literate than others. Some just want to see your walk in life with Christ to get it. Each person is different and each situation needs to be addressed as such.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	But the word 'according' requires an object, the texts. 'According TO' we say.

I think more people are beginning to accept the realization that even if they believe in these texts as being inspiring and full of wisdom, they don't have to take them literally.    I think having access to info about other religions is increasing the diversity. Was a time when everyone in the village would be the same thing and never have heard of the religion 100 miles across the land, let alone 2000 miles across the sea. Now, we have access to them all, we live in diverse towns and neighborhoods and learn from each other, as well as each other's beliefs. We have access to each other's texts and realize they aren't all that different from each other.    Plus there are religions now that don't rely on scripture at all.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	I think the "role" of religion is declining. The text decline is just a side-effect.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	As history has shown, the 'role' of religious texts begins to decline almost the moment they are completed: heresy seems to ride on the issuing of any religious text. Even Paul, the first (and only proven) writer of the New Testament was condemned as a false teacher, a false "apostle" by those who found his words heretical.  And in the first four centuries of 'Christian' texts....those who opposed them were as plentiful as locusts in a wheat field.     As the errancy of religious texts becomes evident, through intense and unbiased scholarship, their influence declines....that is why both the Quran and the Bible (with the Book of Mormon, and the Jehovah's Witness translation of the Bible not far behind)  are considered by the majority of their opponents as nothing more that MYTH, Fable, and Legend...with a few outright lies thrown in  by fraudulent authors with a particular agenda.     Those who wish to attract others to their 'belief system' must do so by example, not by beating them over the head with archaic and erroneous Scripture...especially when those errors are impossible to refute.|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Because no major denomination follows the text, it is not presented as authoritative.  Thus, yes.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	No I don't think it is and  it is not a 'role' Nor are the need, demand, or supply declining at all but rather the opposite, Look at the mega churches. Many are putting out movies centered around moral, Christian and religious values. People have little to say when a movie is made about a serial killer, drug addict, prostitute, bloody monsters, gang killings and rapes, homosexual deviants, and the list goes on and on. But let someone write a book, produce a movie, or express their Christian or religious belief and everyone jumps on the band wagon. Anyone who wants to learn wants to hear and see. As for all the judges waiting to pounce when someone who is trying to live right the best they can, YOU be an example -- you seem to know all about how it should be done -- and let the 'fledglings' follow your perfect example.   You know, if we could be perfect, there would have been no need for the Supreme Sacrifice Jesus made. And because we can not be perfect he made the sacrifice lovingly and willingly. No there is no decline in any role of Christian ministry, nor will there be. It is just that too many people listen to the left wing media and get a wrong idea about many things.

If someday the evidence will point to a more credible theory the atheist has no guilt feeling about accepting a more reliable theory while Christians fear to go to Hell if they deny the Bible record in spite of all the evidence to the contrary!    When the Bible was written and up to about 500 years ago this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth located at the edge of the Milky Way was thought to be the center of this humongous universe. The Bible writers got their science from the Babylonians who also believed that the stars were hanging from a firmament as they revolve around the Earth, the rain water was coming down from above the firmament, the Sun was not a star, and so on.  When the Christians ruled most of the Western world anybody disagreeing with the Church dogmas on science in the Bible was severely punished. Galileo was one of the most famous victims of Church cruelty. Throughout history the Christians struggled to stop any scientific and social advancement to benefit mankind outside of their direct control.  The Bible writers never stopped coming up with new ideas on how to discipline and keep under Clergy control the people that God loves so much. The Bible writers provided all the necessary instructions for Judeo-Christianity not to function without an authoritarian Clergy organization!            Deuteronomy 17:12-13 (NIV) The man who shows contempt for the judge or for the PRIEST who stands ministering there to the Lord your God MUST BE PUT TO DEATH! You must purge the evil from Israel. ALL THE PEOPLE WILL HEAR AND BE AFRAID, AND WILL NOT BE CONTEMPTUOUS AGAIN* (*Holy Mafia talk! Most low IQ Christians of the Westboro class love it!)    Luke 16:17 (NIV) (Jesus said) It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.    For every expression of loving recognition when you behave according to this Gods dysfunctional pleasures the Bible writers listed countless vicious warnings of punishment if you dont. Check Deut 28. The first 14 verses are teasers, but the remaining 54 verses will blow your mind! No wonder Christians hate to read the Bible. They are very content paying their tithes and offerings to the Church and letting their favorite preachers tell them what Christianity ought to be all about! They ignore that this narcissist God wants his obedient followers to be despicably cruel to the members of their own families to the extreme of killing them for any trivial matter that displeases him. In fact, God wants to have all the inhabitants of a city in Israel killed and the city totally destroyed if they begin to worship another God (Deut 13:13-19).  Even within Christianity the definition of God varies from one brand of a Christian faith to another! Only the secular law and order prevents Christians from going crazy killing anybody worshiping the wrong brand of a God.    The Bible writers say that God already destroyed the whole human race including innocent children and pregnant women once before in a big flood because they became wicked! Only a psychopathic God in the most primitive cultures would act this way (Psa 78:65, 18:7-10).  In spite of all that Christians still think that there is any intelligence in the Bible, not even spiritually speaking!    1 Timothy 6:20 (Infallible King James Version) O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, AVOIDING PROFANE AND VAIN BABBLINGS, AND OPPOSITIONS OF SCIENCE FALSELY SO CALLED.     1 Corinthians 3:19-20 (Infallible King James Version) For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.    Revelation 7:1 (Infallible King James Version!) And after these things I saw four angels standing on the FOUR CORNERS of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.    So much for Christian science! You believe it by gullibility or rather faith, or die along with Galileo, if Christianity were to rule the world again!|`|2s7V2wSPaa	Good point|`|51d33745e77cc83c2b248b524116c565aa	"explain how a living being is different from a dead living being?"    What the hell is a "dead living being"? And if you're reffering to a living being which has died, well the difference should be fairly obvious. Dead beings are DEAD were as living beings are not. And there are scientific explanations as to how and why living beings die.|`|4hZ8DROgaa	I don't believe anything as ultimate truth. All scientific "truths" are held to be provisionally true, pending evidence that may disprove them. I don't believe in the nebulous and utterly useless concept of a soul.|`|dvY6UfiYaa	The soul is a manmade concept.  It doesn't actually exist..|`|urIm4YaBaa	The difference between a living being and a dead being is whether or not the cells are still metabolizing and synthesizing needed proteins.     We can't look at cells with our naked eye, so we have to make guesses off of what we can directly observe. Doctors, for example, listen for a heartbeat, check for a pulse, listen for air moving in the lungs, and use an electroencephalogram before determined if a person is dead. The reason is simple: these vital bodily functions are only possible if the cells involved are still functioning properly (i.e., metabolizing and synthesizing). A person in a coma might look like a dead person because he isn't moving, but checks like these will demonstrate that he's still alive.    There is no soul. The belief in a soul is an error in thought: it's based on the assumption that we are, essentially, our thoughts, feelings and memories. When be begin thinking this, we think of ourselves as these ephemeral effects--and not the material body that they rely on. It is wrong to assume that the events of consciousness will continue to exist even after the underlying mechnics of them breakdown. Consciousness is not life itself, but a biological feature.     It's like a program running on a computer: if you break the computer, the program stops working. Similarly, when the body ceases to work, so does its features.|`|a6JNx1tgaa	lol. We don't believe in souls. =]    edit: Heart beating, breathing, thinking, ect. =  Alive. Once your body stops functioning, you're dead.     Silly question really.

And atheists don't claim that "man came from a monkey".  Atheists state that they don't believe in a god.    There is plenty of evidence from evolutionary biology that shows that humans are a type of primate, sharing a common ancestor with the other great apes in Africa (chimpanzees and gorillas) - and developing into a sentient, tool-using biped on the savannas of Africa following the split from the other great ape lineages about 6 million years ago.      But this evidence comes from genetics, paleontology, archaeology, geology, comparative anatomy, cladistic analysis, radiometric dating of volcanic deposits, and biostratigraphy - it doesn't have anything to do with a theological position on the existence or non-existence of bearded skydudes.|`|AA10067344	We don't believe in souls.

Evolution or Talking Snakes... wow... what makes sense?|`|OB3BxHCOaa	I careless about atheists and christians...why don't you look a way to be more productive? It will much more...|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Evolution is not an ultimate truth - it is a scientific paradigm, with countless amounts of evidence to back it up...the origins of life are still an on-going pursuit...    A live body is different than a dead body because the heart is no longer working - without the heart pumping blood through the body, the organs fail, especially those in the brain where the electro-chemical impulses control all the body's functions.  This happens in all biological creatures to different degrees of complexity.    Produce a "soul" for study (or at least take the time to inquire as to why you believe in it) - something in which we can measure the electro-chemical responses in the entity's "brain" that significantly explains the motor movements of what you claim exists independently of the body...if you do that young man, you will begin to create a new paradigm...my suggestion is you educate yourself in the following disciplines - human biology, brain chemistry, particle physics, quantum mechanics, evolutionary psychology, and even some basic philosophy.    EDIT:  I believe I have sufficiently answered your query about the difference between a "dead and living" thing...why you should need a further clarification on what is "living and non-living" makes little sense...if you want more complex answers, please invest in a basic biology book at a used book store or something.|`|3180e2b368500ca94cbac1a023253d3caa	Speaking of Charles Darwin, he was only an armature naturalist and had only observed the finches (birds) on the Galapagos Islands for the first time in the mid 1850s. He noticed that on each island the birds had different shaped beaks according to the type of food available on their particular island. For this reason, he assumed, the birds had progressed over millions of years and only the hardiest of the species had survived the climate and vegetation changes. However, this is totally inaccurate and was dismissed as a mere humor in a TV series on the educational channel in October of 1998. According to the scientists discoveries in that very same year, the effects of the weather phenomenon known as El Nino, the climate on these same exact islands had drastically changed in a single year within a number of months. And to their surprise, the eggs of the finches on each island hatched open producing birds with beaks already altered to accommodate the changes of their environment.    The commentator even said this shoots Darwin's theory completely down and he laughed.|`|AA11264399	Life is a continuous, highly complex chemical reaction.

Not all atheists accept evolution though most do. There are also theists who accept evolution.    I don't call evolution the "ultimate truth". I don't call general relativity or atomic theory the "ultimate truth" either. I don't know that there is such a thing as "ultimate truth".    Evolution does not claim that man came from a monkey. You are not descended from any living species. You and a monkey have a common ancestor as you have a common ancestor will all living things.    In order to function any organism needs to undergo constant numerous chemical reations to sustain bodily systems. When these reactions stop an organism ceases to live.

BMGEi0yCaa	Well, most recently I was at a Denny's near my house with a few friends. It was 3 in the morning and, besides us, there was I think 2 other people in the restaurant. Our waiter was a complete jerk. He didn't introduce himself, say hello, or anything. When we sat down, he came up to us and just said, "drinks?". When he came back with our drinks, he literally came just close enough to our table to slide the drinks across the table to us. If my friend hadn't had her hand out to catch her water, it probably would have spilled all over the table and her.    The guy then proceeded to disappear (to where, I have no idea) and the only other waitress on duty had to take our order. Our food got to us in a timely manner, thanks to the fact that this waitress actually acted like a waitress and was a sweetheart. Our other waiter came back a good 15 minutes later and my friend asked for a water refill. When she said, "excuse me?" to get his attention, he kind of stopped, sighed, and half turned toward her, as if she was about to ask him to do some deplorable thing. She asked for more water and he said "sure" and then disappeared again. She never got her water. We finally went up to the counter and asked for our check and the guy brought it to us and literally threw it on the table and walked away.    When we went to go pay, my friend wanted to leave him a few bucks but I said no, he doesn't deserve it. I dug a penny out of my purse and put it on the table, but I think she went back and left him a dollar while I was in the bathroom. My other friend went back with a pen and a receipt and wrote "try smiling sometime." on the receipt and left it where he could see it.    I mean, I understand that it's a Denny's that we went to and I shouldn't expect upscale service. But honestly, the way the guy acted was just really out of line. He shouldn't be waiter if it makes him so miserable.|`|fee71f13b3c1fcbd618a03eee4ec7248aa	I tipped nothing (and by nothing, I mean, also deleted the gratuity the waiter had already added to the bill). There was a group of about 12 of us who had gone to eat, and we were split between two tables with two seperate servers and one check at each table (which we took care of splitting ourselves). As we were in town for a conference, the restaurant was pretty busy with others who were in town for the conference, as well. Our orders were messed up, the sever did not refill drinks and was generally rude in demeanor toward our table. However, he was serving another table nearby (not others with our group), and was always standing around, chatting and being friendly with them. Then, although the menu stated that a gratuity would be added to tables of 8 or more, our table of 6 received an added gratuity (probably because he knew that with such miserable service, he would be getting little or no tip). We spoke with the manager about his terrible behavior and about the gratuity and had it removed before paying the check. I think one girl at the table left some pocket change (pennies and nickles), but none of the rest of us left anything.|`|0OwP7FTGaa	A group of us tip ZERO regularly.    Tipping is an arbitrary social convention and should be abolished.    http://www.tippingsucks.com|`|chmuDZObaa	I've left a quarter--same reasoning as someone else.  It shows that you are willing to tip but chose to tip very little due to bad service.  Leaving nothing might make them think you forgot.|`|2FNfyxVqaa	The smallest tip I would say is no tip. It had to be because the waitress was nasty and rude, had an attitude, and also we felt like she did nothing but take our order so why should she get a tip.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	Worst tip we ever gave was no tip at all.   The waitress yelled at us because we were at an all you eat fish restaurant and my father gave me a small wedge of his fish with lemon on it. So I could see if I liked it. Well apparently at that restaurant you can't exchange food items. When the waitress saw me eat the fish she flipped out and screamed "it's against the rules"!!  And went on such a tirade we had to call the manager over to calm her down. She did not get a tip.   She did however get fired a few days later when she went off again on another group of people.|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	I've had terrible service.  The correct way to signal poor service is to leave a single penny, which I've done.      To leave nothing simply implies that you are a cheapskate.  But to leave a penny shows that you were willing to tip, you simply received lousy service.    Good service has several hallmarks:    Your server should:    immediately introduce themselves and ask for your drink orders  offer ideas for appetizers  ask probing questions about what you like/don't like/ allergies  return within five minutes with drinks and ready to take the order  return within 15 minutes with food or an update on the food  after food is served (and this is the BIG ONE) they will check back within 1 minute to make sure you have everything you need  then they come by every 10 minutes to refill your drink  offer after dinner deserts/coffee and/or check  return with your card and thank you for coming    Bad service misses one or more of these points but also might mean a bad attitude.  For me, attitude is everything.  If a person shows that they are upbeat and smiling, even if things go wrong, they will still get their 20% (which is the minimum for a tip you cheapos!)|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	$0 because the waitress was just too busy/rude to serve us. She only came to our table twice. To take our order and to deliver the food. We had to ask a passing waiter for our napkins and silverware. She didn't even bother to deliver us the check. We had to walk to the counter. She treated other customers differently, chatting and joking, but not with us.|`|TPVvddHWaa	I like silver's answer, it is a good point.     Tipping is loosing fashion now in Europe most people who wait on tables are on a good wage and do not need to boost their income with tips. Most earn as much, may be more than their customers who do not expect to receive a tip for doing their jobs. In fact, it is considered rather insulting to demonstrate that the person waiting on you is inferior, which you are doing by giving a few coins. In some places waiters have been known to return tips saying that they are paid for what they do.      Years ago when only the wealthy ate out and the waiters were impoverished, it was a different matter.     It is terrible to think that in some countries people are so poorly paid that they need to grovel to get a few extra loose coins.    I do try to be generous when travelling to impoverished countries though.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Me and an ex went out to eat at a Mexican chain restaurant.     As I placed the order, I stated that I am allergic to avocados, no guacamole please. Lo, when the food is served, there was a huge pile of guacamole there. I stated I can't eat this.. yet again repeating that I am allergic. The waitress apologizes and goes back into the kitchen and comes back out less than 5 minutes later, and you can easily see that all they did was scrape the guacamole off the plate. I asked to see a manager, who never showed up after waiting 20 minutes. Me and my ex just upped and left, without eating anything (he didn't order any food) since we were not getting at all what we asked for, never to return again.|`|KncPJwIaaa	nothing cause the service just wasn't up to par and it was empty she was rude of th back and actually pulled a chair to take are order|`|lT9OrmDNaa	0....nada.....nil....    service sucked, we waited forever...took fifteen minutes to get the check...|`|IINSHqz2aa	Two pennies.  The server took 15 minutes from the time we sat down until she took our drink order.  Then then order for dinner took 10 more minutes, someone else served our food, then the waitress NEVER checked on us!  We all had empty glasses.  She never cleared any plates.  I left two cents so she would know that we didn't include the tip on the check....I also left her a note.|`|MEV7M65Xaa	One dollar is the smallest tip I ever gave........for a $50.00 check.  Because the waitress would not leave us alone. We were in the midst of a very very serious discussion and she interrupted us 5 times in 5 minutes.  Also, She took the mans order first and frowned at the very idea of separate checks.........  Another time was when the restaurant seemed to be having trouble in the kitchen and after 45 minutes at lunch we asked another waitress to please find our waitress for us to ascertain the problem.  She never showed up at our table. After another 20 minutes I asked to speak to the manager and he came to our table and explained the problem.  She was right behind him with our food. We have no clue where she was all that time but she sure was not explaining to us what the problem was.|`|j5y1pONfaa	Nothing, but once I left three pennies with lint on it because I think its worse than to leave nothing! We were at a Mexican restaurant for lunch one day and my order was wrong. When the waitress came to check on us I told her and she rolled her eyes and said "you know how Mexicans are, they can't get anything right" I was SO freakin shocked because I happen to be Mexican!!! My hubby was so pissed that he took the ketchup bottle and ran ketchup down both our entire glasses so she couldn't see when she picked them up. Childish...yes...the look on her face when she picked them up...priceless!!!
ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	The average meal takes about 45 minutes from the time a person sits down to when they should be getting the check, this is for most restaruants around the country.  For every 45 minutes after that, that I stay in my seat, I pay another, extra tip of the same amount as the first.    Ex.    45 minutes--$6  at 1:30 -- $12  at 2:15 -- $18    And so forth.      Well, it was a tradition amongst my friends that we would pick a Waffle House and meet there to discuss philosophy, religion, future plans, etc.  These annual chats would last for hours, usually about three or four.  So I've left $40 tips before on a single meal that might have cost $10 bucks.    Waitstaff make their money by "turning the table over" meaning, they might have five tables but they are expecting to turn each of those tables 10-12 times during their shift.  The most disrespectful thing one can do to a waitperson is just sit at their table and not cover the amount that they SHOULD be making on that table if you got up and left.|`|A8oU68uBaa	About $30.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Well we were at Olive Garden, and this waiter had such a people and sales skill that we had to give him credit for it. He has a way to talk you into trying something more expensive, in a way that makes you feel more special, but it's all sales technique. By the end of the meal, it cost us almost $100 and we didn't even had a clue about it. And I am a very frugal person. So, we had to compliment him, and gave him $30 tips. I know I should've given more, but I didn't have any money left with me :P    Anyone who can talk us into having a dinner meal with champagne at 10am in the morning, deserves a good tip!|`|j5y1pONfaa	$50.     The waitress was rude as heck to us and if we asked her to fill our drinks up she acted like it was such an inconvenience. I told hubby don't leave s**t for a tip but when we went to pay at the counter she was on the phone crying. She turned to us and apologized for her behavior. She was still upset because she had just lost her 18 yr old son in a car wreck just a week before. She couldn't afford to take off of work to mourn. All I had left from dinner was $50 and some change. I felt so bad for her.  I couldn't imagine losing my own child.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	$25.00 on a $25.00 check. It was the worst experience I've ever had in a so-called decent restaurant, but not one bit of it was the poor waiters fault. Management didn't cover the shift well, the bus boy was busy playing and gossiping, the bartender and another waitress were playing grab a$$ and our poor waiter was running himself to death because the hostess seated the few customers that were there in separate parts of the building (I don't know why.... We have a no smoking ordinance in all bars and restaurants....) and this is a big building and he was the only person waiting tables....We felt so sorry for the kid that we gave him the change from a $50.00, which amounted to about $25.00. We didn't get half our food, but he was so nice and apologetic and was obviously a bit flustered as he ran around the dining area, that we couldn't help but be nice AND we had plenty of time to observe what else was going on, so we knew he was doing the best he could. We ordered the cheapest meals on the lunch menu or I probably would not have been quite so generous......|`|JcwjDpY8aa	It really depends on the service and the cost of the bill.  My husband and I usually leave a tip of around $60 or so if we are ordering appetizers or tapas and many drinks and the service is impeccable.  I have received an $80 tip on one pizza before, simply because they said they appreciated someone in the business with a good understanding of the product and how to properly serve a guest.|`|nQU21mFiaa	80 buck its was upsclae and the bill was high the waitress was hot and did a really good job|`|wfsCSU6Aaa	$50.00.  The server was an older man, and he had a hole in his shoe.  I felt a little sad for him, and it was around christmas.  Plus my diet coke was never empty,|`|xjBFwsVMaa	Like 10 dollars (what am a broke college student lol)... it was because the waiter was a friend of mine and he really is a good waiter. He came back for refills and asked if we needed anything just at the right moments.|`|MEV7M65Xaa	$150.00 because the service was superb.  The waitress was informative without seeming to want to join our group. She did not barge in and ask if we wanted more tea or Coffee etc...........she just poured it and left. She removed the plates between courses and she smiled nicely. She was groomed well and offered suggestions for menu ideas.  She did not disrupt our conversation more than she had to.  When we needed her we could find her. When it was time to leave she was there with the check. Not before nor did we have to wait for it. She took the payments and was back in only 3 minutes.    When we said thank you she responded with "you are welcome"  She did not debate the point nor put on false modesty about it being her job.|`|YSuc7L8taa	$40.00    And it was by accident as my buddy keeps cash in his pocket and had the habit of putting his money on the table while we ate. On this day service was so bad, we waited an hour and the food still had not arrived, so we got up and left, but my buddy forgot his cash that he left on the table!|`|fee71f13b3c1fcbd618a03eee4ec7248aa	During the same conference where I left the smallest tip, I also left the largest tip for another waiter at another restaurant later on. He was very attentive, a college-age guy who flirted with the table full of high-school age girls and made sure our drinks were filled and everything was to our liking. I tipped over twice the amount of the meal. He tried to follow our table out and return some of our tips (we all tipped pretty generously after our previous poor experience during the conference), but we simply explained what had happened before, and that he'd gotten "the other waiter's tip."

That being said not all marriages between straight people were ever about sexual attraction to their spouse (including some that have children).  Are these marriages a sham?

But I met Mary in a very real way when a very Blessed priest brought the relic of Mother of Guatelupe to the Church for a short time. her presence was very real, first time I experienced that, and first time I really met her as Mother. Fabulous.  In matters of occult and entities, many call out to Mary for help. She is ferocious. I remember the story of the occultist who was fool enough to make a contract with the devil, when time was close he called out to Mary who took the contract from the devil, saving his soul, ending the deal. She is a ferocious spiritual mother, as any mother would be of her children, and powerful !!!! And still very loving. And understanding, She is the complete package, a marvelous creation of God. Definitely QUEEN OF HEAVEN !!!|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Well let's see:    Gospel according to St. John chapter 19, verses 25-27:     "Therefore the soldiers did all these things. But, standing at the foot of the Cross Of Jesus, His Mother, and His Mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clophas, and Mary Magdalene.     When Jesus therefore Saw His Mother, and the disciple whom He Loved, standing nearby, He Said to His Mother, "Woman, behold your son!"    Then He Said to His disciple, "Behold, your Mother!" And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own household."    Looks like Christ Our Lord Wants all disciples to place their trust in His Blessed Mother. To answer your question, yes, all Catholics trust the Blessed Mother Of God, as do Orthodox, Anglicans(Episcopalians), & possibly even Lutherans.    To tell you the truth, it is a shame that most Protestants refuse to put their trust in the Blessed Mother Of God.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I am a Catholic and I don't know if it is a matter of 'trust.' I admire her, and acknowledge the sacrifices and commitment she showed, but Jesus is the Savior, not Mary.    Mary is an important part of most Christian based religion because without her, we would not have our Savior.    Most Catholics love and admire her and say her prayer because she was able to forgo death and go straight to heaven. Therefore, we KNOW she is close to God and may be able to direct our prayers to her Son.|`|74b1131cf5ddd01a70564ef108e130bfaa	Trust for what?

But even that is subordinate to the will of God.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	A devotion to Mary is purely up to the person. It is not a requirement of being Catholic. Most Catholics, however, adhere to the Bible on this..."all generations will call me blessed." Luke 1:48|`|vAbATcTcaa	as a catholic, let me ask you a question.  Are we to imitate our Lord in all things, except when it comes to loving or really trusting his mother?  Did Jesus , really love and or trust his own mother? Why does the bible state that she will be called blessed among all women for all generations?--and does your church have any documentation on being apart of this professy , ie all generations that will call her blessed?     As for me, Jesus is my savior, He came to me, thru' his mother mary, so if she is good enough for Jesus, she's good enough for me, and Jesus can come to me, thru his mother, any time he chooses, I love his mother, I trust his mother as did Jesus, as did the apostles after Jesus died, they had mary with them when they prayed for coming of the holy spirit, and don't delude yourselves into thinking, that her pressence was anything but comfort for the grieving apostles, she was their source of inspiration and a reminder of all that they had hoped in our Lord, Mary, his mother, was there to be the example of prayerful faith and hope and expectation of the promise of her only son, to send the paraclete.  Did the apostles trust mary in all she told them during this ordeal?  Well, scriptures may not spell it out for you, but I have faith that she was a true source of consolation for them and that of corse, she spoke with them and boded them on, in their faith and waiting and praying. Any christian who would not beleive this, is in desparate need of enlightenment and conversion of heart. To detract from the mother of Jesus, who stood silently by as her son was tortued and dying on the cross, is a great statement of what faith is, and what it is not.  She is our spiritual mother given to us by Jesus thru' the words spoken from the cross saying "son, behold thy mother". We are that son, that is why Jesus did not say specifically "John", rather, son, meaning all of us.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	You know, sometimes when one spiritual tradition tries to supplant another, the old beliefs don't die so easy, so the supplanters usually redress the old belief in some new surface dogma and try to sway all in that direction.

FyLfEPv0aa	The issue here are people thinking that works mean that you can't have faith or that works deny the grace of Christ.    Nobody ever said "we believe in works and works only".    BOTH are needed.    Acts 26:20 was one I read this morning " that they should repent and turn to God, AND DO WORKS meet for repentance."        Beyond the argument of faith vs. works comes the question - why does it bother you if someone does works as well?  Are other peoples striving to be more Christlike really offensive to you?      Sadly those who are fully comitted and offended at the idea of "works" are generally trying to justify themselves based on faith with works lacking.  Why not do both?|`|NWnOTkwCaa	CJ is correct|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	We have to have faith, the bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God, but faith without works is dead, meaning when God tells you to do something, no matter how crazy it is, you have to do it, believing God, and the works is that you move on your faith, if you never make a move, you are telling God that you don't believe Him...|`|EM0kiImHaa	You have too many verses to go through them one by one but most of them are saying that if you have true faith, you also will do good works. If you are not doing good works, you may want to question your faith.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Are we saved by grace or works?    Ephesians 2:8,9; Romans 3:20,28; Galatians 2:16   and James 2:24; Matthew 19:16-21      Saved by grace   (Ephesians 2:8-9) - "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, that no one should boast."   (Rom. 3:20,28) - "because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin...28For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law."   (Galatians 2:16) - "nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified."   Saved by works  (James 2:24) - "You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone."   (Matthew 19:1617) - "And behold, one came to Him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?" 17And He said to him, "Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."        God does not want a faith that is empty and hypocritical.  James 2 is talking about those who "say" that they have faith but have no works.  Therefore, people cannot tell if they are true believers or not, because there is no fruit.  That kind of a faith is useless and is not a saving faith.  True faith results in true works.         In Matthew 19:16-17, Jesus was speaking to a Lawyer who was self-righteous since he wanted to put Jesus to the test (Luke 10:25).  He asked what he must do in order to obtain eternal life and Jesus responded with the requirements of keeping the commandments.  If a person keeps all of the commandments, it would seem that they could obtain eternal life.  However, nobody can keep all of the commandments.  Therefore, Jesus' comments to this man show this man that justification can only be by faith since no one can keep all of the commandments.  This is why it says in Eph. 2:8 that we are saved by grace through faith.  Also, Romans 3:20,28 and Galatians 2:16 tells us that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law; that is, by the works that he can do.       There is no contradiction at all when we examine the contexts.  We are justified by faith but that faith must be alive (James 2).  The Law cannot save us because we are incapable of keeping it (Matthew 19:16-17).  Therefore, salvation is by grace through faith.|`|BtygS0Hraa	I agree completely.  Faith without works is dead.  Works without faith is a waste of time.  You need both faith AND works!|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	I think you are missing what we are saying. Works are very important. They just do not save us, because Jesus fully paid the price on the cross.    Do not ignore the verses on works. Do not ignore Ephesians 2:8-10 either! Works do not save us one tiny bit!    Matt 7:21. What is the Father's will?  John 6:40  For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."    Proverbs 24:12 - Yes! We are rewarded for our works    Matthew 5:16 - Yes! We are to do good works and give God glory through them. This is not for salvation though.    James 2:14-26 - Yes! If we have faith, the faith will cause us to do works. James is talking to those already saved though. Again, works are a result of being saved.    Revelations 20:12-13. This is true. We are judged according to our works. As you read on though, the ones that went to heaven had their name written in the book of life. How do you get your name written in the book of life? (John 3:16)    Romans 2:13. This is true, but read on. Nobody has fully DONE the law.  Romans 3:19-23  Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.  (20)  Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.  (21)  But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.  (22)  This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,  (23)  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,    P.S. Kerry -   For we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do (2 Nephi 25:23)    The AFTER ALL WE CAN DO part is not Biblical. It is a lie from the pit and that is how we know Joseph Smith was demon possessed. . I don't know how I can be more clear. We cannot add one tiny bit to what Christ did on the cross. We work, BECAUSE we are saved. We don't do anything to be saved.    P.P.S "James is NOT talking about those that are already saved. Where does James say that?"    Christians are adopted as sons and daughters.  James 1:2  My BRETHEREN, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;    "why would the Master, Jesus Christ say in Matthew 7:21 that even those that proclaim him "Lord, Lord" which is faith and belief, are not then saved."    I've already addressed this. LDS claim Jesus is "Lord, Lord" just as these people did. These people said:    Matthew 7:22  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?    LDS say basically this same thing - we've done works for your name!    These people did not make it to heaven. LDS are headed on the same path.    We need to do the father's will!!!  John 6:40  For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."|`|KcHhLsCAaa	I do not understand those that think you just have to say, I believe in Christ," then think that such automatically saves them.       Didn't Christ say that by your "fruits" you should be known.   That sounds like what you do.

We will be judged according to our works, but so will sinners.  it's our faith that separates us and gets us saved, Ephesians says it is a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast.    God doesn't want us to think we had anypart in it, or pride will consume us.    it's by faith alone, by grace alone, by Christ alone that leads to salvation.

Let me explain why.  Doing works is another way of saying obeying God.  So those who are trying to argue that you do not need works are trying to say that you do not need to obey God.   I am certain that God will not condemn anyone for thinking that they need to obey Him, and certainly not for obeying Him.   And even if you do not need to obey God to get into heaven, I really do not think that anything bad could come from saying like Christ did so frequently Father not my will, but thine be done.     Are works important?  Is it important to obey God?  Everything that Christ did was in obedience to his Father.   Christ the greatest to ever walk this Earth lived a life of perfect obedience. Everything that Christ did was also to teach a lesson.   He was and is the master teacher.   So if the only perfect teacher to ever walk the Earth spent His life in perfect obedience, then how could anyone who follows Him be able to disregard that obviously extremely important  lesson on obedience that their Master tried to teach them.   We do need to obey the commandments of God. Not because it will get us back to heaven, but because it will help us to keep our faith strong and keep it growing.   I try to follow God completely. I will not disregard anything that he has taught. I will continue to strive to shape and mold my life after the example that he left me, not because I believe that doing this will get me into heaven, but Because Christ is my Lord and Master, so I will make His will my will. I will obey Him because I love Him and worship Him.|`|AA11564934	But what about:    Romans 4:2      For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory.

John 3:18, 36      He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already .... He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.    Acts 16:30-31      Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.    Romans 1:16-17      For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God salvation to every one that believeth.... As it is written, The just shall live by faith.    Romans 3:20      By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.    Romans 3:28      A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.    Romans 4:2      For if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory?    Romans 4:13      For the promise ... was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.    Romans 5:1      Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.    Romans 10:9      If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.    Galatians 2:16      A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ.    Galatians 3:11-12      The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith.    Ephesians 2:8-9      For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.

Hence, "Lord, Lord, did I not...  (fill in the blank) do this in your name?"  The will of the Father is gaining accurate knowledge of what it is that he wants and being the example to it, or trying to.  Anyone can do works but much of it is not for God or the Son or done the way he wants.  It does matter how you worship.  He has a book that guides you and the answers are there if you really look or want to.    Your second verse is about the condition of your heart and that God knows what's in it.  He judges you by your heart.  If you say you don't lust for example, but it is in your heart to do so, he knows it.  Everyone is judged according to their own hearts, no one else's.

That's why  Mormonism has a false "jesus" and a false "god".  2 Corinthians 11:4 says there are groups that have "another jesus" that isn't the true Jesus, and no "other jesus" can save anyone.|`|AA11992885	i don't try to reconcile the NT, as it is filled with lies, nothing more, hence the reason i don't hold it as doctrine, i view it as little more then a fictional story like Peter Pan    atleast in Peter Pan, he can fly|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	Part of the disconnect between Latter-day Saints and other Christian denominations is that the o.c. seem to think that LDS define 'works' as ordinances, church service, etc -   The works or actions of faith to a Latter-day Saint are prayer, scripture study, and becoming Christlike - assisting the needy, uplifting the poor and downtrodden, becoming meek, etc.  These match up with many o.c. perspectives.  Latter-day Saints heed the commandment of Jesus Christ to 'be ye therefor perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect' - thru obedience to the laws and principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  LDS understand that we will inevitably fall short - no matter how hard we try - we cannot, in mortality, become perfect as our Father in Heaven.  This is where the great atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ comes into play.  As we repent of our sins, Christ's atonement pays the demands of Justice upon our soul - lifting us unto salvation and our eternal reward [which we refer to as exaltation].

9H1FZw7xaa	I have been humbled by the incredible outpouring of love, service, and financial commitment by the LDS Church, and their far reaching humanitarian program.  As a life long member, I have seen the scope and intensity grow, individual accountability is still first and foremost as the overarching guideline, but helping our worldwide neighbors has never been more critical, nor less important.  There have been I would say, hundreds of projects that go on yearly, maybe even more.  I live in the state of Washington, and as recently as last month, I was involved in a project that was needed because of the over flowing of some of our rivers.  Many, many people lost so much, and needed to have help when their homes and businesses were flooded.  There were hundreds of people who responded to the call for assistance, but the LDS Church not only provided man/woman power, they delivered needed food, hygeine, clothing, housing, repair, etc., services, and ALL free of charge, and on a volunteer basis, asking nothing in return.  The LDS Church not only takes care of its own members, it has a mission to do as much as possible for the rest of the world.  I could go on and gon, for hours, but I will not.  I just appreciate the beauty of the principle of love and brother/sisterhood that exists in my church.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	I think it's an excellent example of being beholden to no one...|`|xyIZv6iiaa	I think it rocks.

The LDS Church does not take or get grants from the federal Government? never have never will? The money used by the church for the humanitarian comes from donors most wealthy. It is a easy way for them to help because the church is organized to do these things. sometimes they have to work through other religious organizations such as the Catholic Church or even Muslim they use the best way to get the aid where it is needed. The Church will be fine as long as it's members are earning but if they are not then there is nothing to pay tithing on. But they get nothing from the Feds. www.lds.org|`|FByWgM5baa	What I don't understand is how is this move by Obama not crossing the separation of church and state line?  As I see it it's not okay for churches to try and meddle in politics but it's okay if it's the government trying to stick their noses in religions? This will only end badly imo.      I LOVE that the Church doesn't have to take handouts and instead can give lots and lots of hands up.

jQ5pz7BYaa	If Mary sinned would not she need a Saviour?  Only a  sinner needs a Saviour right?    Then we need to find a scripture where she prayed to her Saviour her God.  And it turns out there is a passage where she did pray.    Luke1:46-55  And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in "God my Saviour".  For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.    If she was sinless she would not be in need of a Saviour. So I believe that the scriptures do not say that mary was sinless.  And to teach other wise would contradict the scriptures that all are sinners.|`|AA10063342	The only person who did not sin was Yeshua (Jesus) And he is our only salvation.

I don't know why people thought that.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Where in Scripture does it say she DID have sin? Her, specifically?     If you're going to go sola, do it all the time.     By the way, where in the NT does it say that the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph ever moved beyond betrothal? The Bible speaks of St. Joseph's "espoused" wifebut never mentions anything beyond it.    "Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut." (Ezekiel 44:2).    This has always been interpreted by the Fathers of the Church to be a typological reference to the Virgin Mary and the Incarnation. When we consider that God took flesh from the Virgin's womb, it is not difficult to imagine that this womb would remain virgin.    The bottom line is this has been the consistent and universal view of the Church from the time of the Apostles until recently. Not only was this view held universally in the Early Church, but the Early Reformers all believed it as well. John Wesley did too.    I am going to go with what the Apostles and early church fathers believed over what some johnny come lately says.        Wrong. Johnny come latelys are those who in the last couple of hundred years have decided that everyone before them was wrong and evil, etc. I refuse their lies.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	The Catholic Church believes that Mary was without sin because of God's special grace given to her. They will tell you that Mary, being "full of grace", was set apart from all other humanity and remained sinless.    However, most Christians, including myself, believe that Mary was, like the rest of mankind, sinful and in need of Christ's sacrifice. To say she wasn't is to belittle what Christ did for all people--including his mother.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	The Immaculate Conception of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is the belief that God preserved Mary from any inclination to sin, the inheritance of original sin passed on to all mankind from our first parents, Adam and Eve. The belief of the Immaculate Conception of Mary says nothing about Mary and personal sin (Rom 3:23). Christian belief holds that every human being through faith and through baptism is freed from sin - original sin and personal sin - through the grace of Jesus Christ. Roman Catholic Christians simply claim that Mary was the first one to whom this was done. The basis for the belief in the Immaculate Conception of Mary can be found in the Biblical revelation of holiness and the opposite of that state, sinfulness.     God is revealed as perfect interior holiness.     "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts!" they (the Seraphim) cried one to the other." ---Is 6:3     No sin or anything tainted with sin can stand in the face of the holiness of God. "Enmity" is that mutual hatred between Mary and sin, between Christ and sin.     "I will put enmity between you (the serpent, Satan) and the woman (Mary), and between your offspring (minions of Satan) and hers (Jesus); He will strike at your head, while you strike at his heel."---Gen 3:15      "And coming to her (Mary), he (the angel Gabriel) said, "Hail, favored one (kecharitomene)"--- Lk 1:28     The salutation of the Angel Gabriel indicates that Mary was exceptionally "highly favored with grace" (Gk.: charitoo, used twice in the New Testament, in Lk 1:28 for Mary - before Christ's redemption; and Eph 1:6 for Christ's grace to us - after Christ's redemption).     "(God) chose us in him (Jesus), before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blemish before him. In love he destined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, in accord with the favor of his will, for the praise of the glory of his grace (echaritosen) that he granted us in the beloved.  --- Eph 1:4-6     The constant faith (paradosis) of the Church attests to the belief in the special preparation of the holiness of the person of Mary to bear in her body the most holy person of the Son of God.|`|JMOLRKRraa	God made Her so. He can do as He pleases.  Jesus did not have Original sin. The sin is with the man, anyway.  Jesus was not of earthly man, but spiritual God. So there was absolutely no sin in Him. None from Mary, none from His true Father God.   Mary also ascended into heaven, no death because She had no sin. Why God would even have to explain himself to anyone, is beyond me. Although He does help us to learn about Him and Understand, Know and be Wise.|`|1eQcq4eZaa	the only human to have never sinned was, of course, Mary's son, the LORD...    you know the deal...Mary never knew the "sin" of being with a man before the LORD was conceived|`|b0IYXTcBaa	That Mary had no sin is tradition and not supported by scripture.

But there are two ways of redeeming. God could allow one to be born in sin and  then purify the soul by subsequent application of the merits of Christ, or He could, by an  anticipation of the merits of Christ, exempt a soul from any actual contraction of original sin.  Thus He exempted Mary from any actual inheritance of the sin, and she owes her exemption  to the anticipated merits of Christ. In other words, she was redeemed by Christ by prevention  rather than by subsequent purification.    In Gen. III., 15, God said to Satan, "I will put enmities between thee and the woman ...  thou shalt lie in wait for her heel." The radical enmity between Satan and that second Eve,  the Mother of Christ, forbids her having been under the dominion of Satan, as she would  have been had she ever contracted original sin in actual fact In Lk. I., 28, we read how the  Angel was sent by God to salute Mary with the words, "Hail, full of grace." Grace excludes sin, and had there been any sin at all in Mary she could not have been declared to be filled  with grace. The Protestant version translates the phrase as "thou that hast been highly  favored." But the Greek certainly implies "completely filled with holiness." However,  complaints that our doctrine exempts Mary from the contracting of original sin are becoming  more and more rare in a world which is tending to deny original sin altogether, and which  wishes to exempt everybody from it.    St. Paul says that One died for all, and therefore all were dead.   II.Cor. V., 14.    Such texts must be interpreted in the light of other passages where God reveals that Mary  was never under the dominion of Satan. Mary is included in these words of St. Paul  juridically in so far as she was born of Adam, but she was not allowed to be born in sin to be  afterwards redeemed.   She was redeemed by prevention.
N9WzNLsRaa	Like they said... Slave owners didn't really get married. They were bred BUT they did "jump the broom" which signified they were married but it wasn't done in a church or with a pastor... A another slave was the "pastor".    EDIT: And sure they COULD have... I don't think anyone's ruling out the possibility. But who could've or would've known? Families were torn apart and most couldn't keep in contact with each other but on the other hand I read a book (Can't remember the title) where a slave was torn from her family. Her mom had a friend at the plantation she was moved to who would watch over her and they would meet up late at night. So her siblings and parents knew who she was, so I guess if that happened often (Which I'm sure it did.)... You can rule that out.|`|aUScPZFYaa	-Good question.

CNYvMUAtaa	The kind of reasoning that your question seems to employ is the same fallacious logic that was used in medieval witch dunking:     If the "witch" was innocent then she would drown, but she would go to heaven. If this happened, the people conducting the trial incontrovertibly murdered her, though their defence would be that they had saved her soul. Heaven and souls are a matter of opinions, whereas life and death are a matter of fact.     Similarly, assaulting a boy by punching him in the face is a matter of fact, whereas "exorcism" is a matter of opinion.     But then, if you think that autistic people are possessed by the devil, you probably also think witches exist, when if fact they were merely women persecuted by an ignorant society.

The "cud" one qualifies for that - and it's a shame that bible translators are so willing to allow such imprecision for the sake of brevity.  Nevertheless, this is the only case shown here (I know of only one other...)    1) Rabbits don't chew cud.    Granted - but they *do* continue chew their food as a sort of "pellet" after grazing.  Strictly speaking, this is not a "cud".  However, translators have chosen to use "chew cud" rather than the more precise "continue to chew food already masticated long after grazing".  I think you can see why the shorter, less precise term is selected by translators.  Still - score:  you, 1; bible, 0      2) The stars aren't little lights fixed in a sky dome.    Nor does the bible claim that they are.  Score:  you, 1; bible, 1      3) Day and night didn't happen before the sun existed.    You cannot possibly know such a thing.  To rely on such an assumption is groundless belief.  Score:  you, 1; bible, 2.      4) Insects don't have 4 legs.    I have yet to see any mature insect that does not have 4 legs.  Score:  you, 1; bible, 3.      5) The moon is not a light source.    Quite the contrary, the moon is most definitely a source of light for the earth.  This is an easily established fact.  Don't take my word for it, though - ask any scientist.  If the moon is not a source of light for the earth, how much "moonlight" would the earth receive if there were no moon?  The bible does not indicate that the moon generates its own light - only that it is a source of light, which it most certainly is.  Score:  you, 1; bible, 4.      It would appear that the bible is much more true than you are.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com
GrpYjwH8aa	The Bible clearly states that the god of this present world is Satan the Devil, and he is the one that has blinded the minds of the unbelievers. Jesus acknowledged Satan as being the current leader of the world, which is why it is so bad. Jehovah God has no injustice found in him, he would NEVER blind people's minds to learning the truth, how would that make sense? This is a testing period, either we listen to the truth, accept it, and apply it in our lives regardless of Satan's attacks on us, or we don't. Jehovah God will step in very soon putting an end to Satan's rule forever.|`|mFGyonmTaa	You're question is gramatically challenged...|`|JCnSm91uaa	Free will in the Bible is a JOKE...!!!    Regardless of any free will the Bible God could have prevented Eve from touching a fruit from the tree of knowledge of GOOD AND EVIL simply because GOD IS LOVE and Eve HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AT ALL of any evil! Eve saw that the fruit was good to eat and she ate it in all her innocence in spite of any ban! Eve had no Guardian Angel to advice her of anything wrong. She must have thought that God was wrong again like when he created man alone!  She didnt know that God set her up to fall! Again, she had no knowledge of ANY EVIL AT ALL!     As soon as God created the angels almost half of them were not one bit impressed with Gods Beauty and Holiness and 1/3 of them rebelled against him ON FREE WILL and on the spot! According to the Theologians the highest ranking angel ever created was LUCIFER* (*Light Bearer) which is another of Gods goofs. He must have thought highly of Lucifer! If God were my employee I would question his competence! God created Eve only as an afterthought! And so Eve ate from the forbidden fruit tree for about the same reason we eat any fruit that we feel that will help us to improve our well being. She had no way of knowing that Satan (aka Lucifer, aka The Old Serpent) was EVIL! Any Christian with a measurable IQ can tell you that the Bible God set up Eve to eat the forbidden fruit only with the permission of his/her spiritual leader!    The Bible writers created an original whimsical God different from the other primitive Gods. The angels that rebelled against him were not evicted from Heaven at all. They became known as demons. According to the Bible writers they will be evicted from Heaven during the Tribulation of the last days (Rev. 12:9-10)! Nothing really makes sense in the Bible unless you have plenty of spiritual gullibility or rather FAITH!    God set up a flaming sword moving back and forth to protect the Tree of Life so no matter how much free will Adam and Eve may have had they couldnt eat of it and live for ever. God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve!    God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abrahams sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he wouldn't SIN against God"! God himself (NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF) was present in this Kings Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that King Abimelech might have enjoyed with Sarah! (BTW Abimelech means my Dad is the God Moloch not related to any Bible God) But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of omnipresence nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much go to be tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesnt take too many neurons in anybodys brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap that some Christians are willing to kill to defend! Actually, it takes years of schooling to keep Christianity marketable today!     Genesis 20:2-6 and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by Gods Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only God knows how many nights he was already watching him perform in his royal bedroom!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband. God didnt question on whether the king was a married man! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers! God declared King Solomon the wisest man EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH, too maybe because he watched him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the Time God in the person of the Holy Ghost had to visit the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he KNEW A LOT about how to please mortal women!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he was aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN or even FOX NEWS for that matter was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objections for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it!) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is just like EVE did, but sorry to say Sarah was a sinful sexy woman not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you cant possibly commit a sexual sin against this Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldnt the world be different today? Christians tell you that this God was very apologetic preventing Sarah from enjoying having sex because she was going to be one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus ancestors were loaded of sexual escapades! It is all in the Bible scrip!)      Compare the Bible writers sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! |`|xo1fabj6aa	So you admit JW's are not born again Christians?

For example although Jehovah's Witnesses and Non Christians talk about Christmas pagan origin many Christians refuse to believe it is not a holy day and continue to practice it...God has allowed an operation of error to go to these ones because they refuse to believe the truth when they hear it...so though it is unholy they sincerely believe it is holy and they are doing a good thing celebrating it.      I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses    How to recognize counterfeit Christians  http://www.counterfeitchristians.info/|`|yz6qXwUiaa	Hi Tee,    It saddens me when anyone thinks that Jehovah creates people and doesn't allow them free choice.  That prior to their even being born he had pre-determined that they are "going to hell" or whatever.    It is quite clear by the Bible in the account of Adam and Eve that Jehovah values free will.  Also in the account of Cain and Able.  Jehovah warned Cain where his heart's inclinations were heading, and Cain chose to ignore the warning.    It is a Calvinist philosophy that tries to teach that people start out with no choice at all, but that God pre-disposes some for life and some for eternal torment in hellfire.  That would hardly be fair or just would it?    Charles Taze Russell started his early life with this teaching by his church and he found the idea appalling.  He knew that God is supposed to be loving, just and wise, and this teaching bothered him so much that he couldn't even imagine how a just, loving and wise God could DO such a thing.  He felt that such a god could be neither loving, just OR wise.  And it was just this very idea that saddenned and appalled him so much that he felt he needed to dig deeper and try harder to understand God's Word.    It was exactlly this false teaching therefore that led to our deep and true understanding of who Jehovah is.  His love, his mercy, his true personality.  It was this false teaching that led to our digging deeper and beginning to understand that Jehovah's primary qualities are "Love, Wisdom, Justice, and Power" and that  it is exactly in these 4 ways (primarily) that man was made in God's image.    IF therefore we feel something offends and appalls OUR OWN sense of Justice, we have to know that we are not more right, nor more Just than God.  And with that thought in mind it becomes clear that if someone is teaching something false about God, something so awful that it totally offends our sense of Justice, that likely that teaching IS false.  We are not more righteous than God.  If we are appalled, then likely HE is too.    It is people who don't understand his personality, people who don't know him, don't see him for who he really is who would say such a thing about our Father who loves us and who is ALWAYS perfectly Loving, Wise and Just and who is powerful enough to make his will be done in righteousness.    Since these people ARE "unbelievers" who insist on making God over in their own image, who are insistant on making him into someone he is not, or who want to make him vengeful and angry, rather than as the Bible tells us he is "the happy God".  They teach this blinded philosophy.  And God allows them to harden their hearts and to stay blinded.  It is what they have chosen.  He allows their free will.    But to anyone (like CT Russell) who is genuinely disturbed by such a false idea about God, he leads them to find true light about who and what kind of God he is.|`|W3ptH1JCaa	Could you maybe rewrite this question in English?

Some books are written for the highly educated, others for children, still others for those in specialized fields. While the Bible is easily available to all, it is meant to be understood and appreciated by a particular group of people. Jehovah crafted it for the humble, the meek ones of the earth. Such people can grasp the sense of the Bible, whatever their education, culture, station in life, or ethnic group. (1?Timothy 2:3,?4) On the other hand, an understanding of Bible truth is denied to those not rightly disposed, no matter how intelligent or educated they may be. The haughty, the proud, cannot grasp the precious truths of Gods Word. (Matthew 13:11-15; Luke 10:21; Acts 13:48) Only God could produce such a book.

Seems you have more than usual gifts, you should be grateful.  But reasoning it out, the first three are fluid. Maybe you are only controlling air, and see it pushing manipulating water and fire.  Earth would be earthquakes. Fire would be generated from no where. Water would be tides, and creation of water. Biblically how did God control them. Water from the earth below and from heavens above, released for the flood of Noah, are you doing that, or just blowing it around. Destructive fire from the heavens, destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, calling down fire from heaven. Sparking fire where there was no fire before, otherwise you are blowing it around. So now we have air, how much air are you pushing, controlling, really? enough to flicker a flame, ripple a cup of water or what.

I have no ability to control air or water, fire isn't something you can control thats why only sometimes it works. To change fire is to understand fire has a will of it's own, you can't control it like you would a puppet (on another subject, you shouldn't be attempting to 'control') you can only guide it. I have no latent psychic or what not talents regarding this, fireshaping was learnt by observation and anyone can do it.    About earth, I've not researched too much on that.    Do email me at aleanvari@yahoo.com regarding this, I can only provide more insght about fire but in return I want to be able to shift air and water. So it's an exchange, let's discuss.|`|Di7zRKEIaa	these were the last folk who claimed that :http://sarsen56.wordpress.com/solve-this...|`|3KrItZHbaa	Your name corresponds to your question.

Eg, its easy to control untainted water, say rain water, which is simply 2 elements, rather than say city tap water which ofter control up to 20 other elements, especially chlorine.     Earth is the most complicated becuase it contains not only s many elements in a simgle particle, but because its hard to pick up some earth mentally without practice, without also picking up micro-organisms such as bacteria, and fungi, themselves made up of many chemicals and compositions.     If you can control fire, you should be able to pick up purified earth, but id try practicing with complicated liquid substances first.

You're not quite important enough to make and stick to plans for." as if they were so important and popular that they have friends to burn.    The best response is "We'll just have to catch you next time then when you're more sure of your schedule." When people give me a maybe, I cancel them out right then and there.     If it was "let me check my schedule and get back to you" which is acceptable. YES, ACCEPTABLE to say that. read the whole thing people! sigh....    Don't put up with it, ever. When people do that, just write them out of that event immediately and don't put up with the "oh let me see if I feel like it on that particular day"|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	Some people have a hard time delivering rejection.  If you knew this was something that she wouldn't want to do, why ask her and put her on the spot like that?  Couldn't you have sent an email or a text or something.      I can't stand when people make me tell them no.      As for you, don't ask a question unless you are prepared for the answer.  "We'll see" is a perfectly acceptable answer to that question.

All we have to do is ask God for forgivness.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Sometimes people do have to say maybe.  They may not be able to get a babysitter.  They might have to work (some people don't get their schedules right away).  They may be short on cash and have to see if they can budget those plans in.      While I understand that it's frustrating not to get a yes or no, sometimes it's hard for someone with an unreliable schedule to give an answer until closer to the date.      Another reason people have a hard time saying no is that some people get very angry when told no.  I know I have been asked to events, and when told that I wouldn't be interested/couldn't make it I was blasted for it.  Some people don't want to risk someone forcing them into something they don't want to do and saying "Maybe" is the only way that they may be able to avoid going.|`|6n8LdKEUaa	Well, I'm brazilian and I don't speak english very well, but I will try issue a opinion.

It's not like she said "sure" then didn't show up. THAT would be a lie.    ...or perhaps she really isn't sure if she can or wants to attend. That does happen with some people so they don't give a firm answer....although as you said some just have trouble saying no. They're afraid they'll get a guilt trip or be asked for an explanation, or some other situation that could cause them discomfort or awkwardness.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	well why did you ask her to go -did you think it would be a good time for her? sounds like something nobody really wants to attend and/or can't afford to donate to .does she know your co-worker?yet alone her sister-in law?You put her in a difficult position  and it sounds like she was trying to back out gracefully-not lie .and personally you sound a little mean  maybe if you were a bit nicer this wouldn't happen to you so often.|`|8OREBeRdaa	A few factors come into play  - Is this a consistent answer from her?  If so, then you shouldn't be upset as it is almost expected.  If it's not, then perhaps give her the benefit of the doubt as to why she may not be interested in attending.    - People don't like to deliver rejection in this instance as it seems they cannot be relied upon.  Don't assume it's just she's not interested...she could be just indecisive.     - People also don't like to deliver negative actions for fear of the other person's reaction.  If you're this upset over what is essentially a "maybe" then how upset are you going to be if she says "no"? (Regardless of the fact that it sounds like it's for a good cause)    How many other people did you invite?  Simply follow up the next day or so to confirm.  Don't push the issue but just say that you'd appreciate a decision.

The first one is quoted from Saheeh al Bukhaaree and the second one is quoted from a Shee'ah book: "Takhlees ash-Shaafee"    It is mutawaatir upon 'Alee radhiallaahu anhu from his son:    ???? ???????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ????? ???? ????? ????? ?????? ????????? ???? ??????? ????????? ?????? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ????? ???? ?????? ???? ??????????????

Abu Bakr or 'Alee" He said "Abu Bakr". The one who asked him said, "You say this while you are a Shee'ee?"

"....because Allah's hand (of protection) is on keeping unity..."    it doesn't say believe in what they believe in because they're right....  ....it says be with them because Allah SWT wants unity.  and that is EXACTLY what Shias say, even when some sunnis call us kafirs and etc etc.....      what Imam Ali (as) has said is EXACTLY what he (as) did himself.....    he did NOT agree with abubakr and omar and othman, BUT he didn't fight them, because as a Muslim, as an Imam, as a person appointed by Allah SWT he has a duty and his duty is to keep the Umma as one, and if he had fought those people, Islam would have been another croupted religion like christianity.    he did NOT agree with them, BUT he didn't fight them either.  BUT at the same time, he showed his disagreements with them  how?  for example:  we all know he (as) was the lion of Allah SWT.....  ....BUT the lion of Allah SWT didn't participate in the battles started by these caliphs....    and another example is that he didn't give the oath of allegiance to abu bakr for a long time.....    So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him  until the end of her life. She lived for 6 months after the death of the Messenger of Allah.  When She died, her husband. Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself.  In the same Hadith Aisha goes on to say:  He (Ali) had not yet given allegiance to him (Abu Bakr) as Caliph during these months    Sahih Muslim Book 019, Hadith 4352        so....  Imam Ali (as) is saying believe in what you think you should believe in....  ....believe in the truth which is:    "O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord, for if thou do it not, thou wilt not have conveyed His message. Allah will protect thee from mankind. Lo! Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. " Quran 5:67    After that verse came to the porphet pnuh&hf    the porphet said this :"One who has me as his master has Ali as his master.  Right after that this was sent to the prophet:  5:3:  "...This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; ..."      but do not fight the other muslims, as Allah SWT wants unity.      and aren't Shias doing what's he's saying?  we see sunnis blowing themselves up in the Shirins killing lots and lots of Shias.....    but you don't see Shis doing that that.....                                                                                                                            conclusion:    you failed..........|`|0NXdjyo2aa	The Qur'an also says not to divide, so as soon as Prophet Muhammed (pbuh ) died, it wasn't long before Shiaism emerged.

It acknowledges prayer for example but does not understand excessive ritualistic prayers that are dutiful exercise but not measure of true devoutness because they do not explore the concepts with the ritualistic recitations. Much about Islam in practice today is not in moderation. Another example, the forbiding of music when the chapter titled Poets explains near the end of it that there are those poets and their readers (this includes musicians and their listeners) who are astray, yet there are those among them as well who are true followers.    Allah's hand is on keeping unity Ali allegedly said, yet Qur'an says Allah tests us with divisions and foretold at the time of its revealing of more division to come. Ali is not Allah and Ali is not infallible. If Ali said this, perhaps he made a mistake in encouraging conformity to peer pressure rather than encouraging standing alone against others if you need to in order to stay true to Allah.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Dear Nasibi Wahabi,    so you read Nahj al-Balaghah? hope you read the part where it says that Muawiya(L) stopped the water at the river for Imam Ali(AS)?    did you read all the letters and sermons too?  _______________________________  With regard to me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who loves me too much and the love takes him away from rightfulness,    and he who hates me too much and the hatred takes him away from rightfulness.

I had not problems until the GYN said I needed to go off of them about 4 years ago.  Luckily I don't have the night sweats, but still have about 5-6 personal summers a day.  Fortunately, they have begun to subside the last couple of weeks.  I have a friend in her early 70's who still has hot flashes.  Do they last that longggggg?  I, too happened to catch Oprah the other day when the subject was menopause.  I agree with the Oprah guests in that we have to be our own advocates.  Menopause was a taboo subject.  Now that the baby boomers are coming of menopause age, I think we will see more attention given to menopausal women.|`|wy54YPuQaa	They didn't have HRT during my grandmother's generation and she lived to be 96.  How do think women survived for thousands of years without?  When my health care provider suggested I get on it after menopause, I refused.  I have heard a lot of women get on it because it helps keep your skin looking younger.|`|JIATcwW6aa	I don't watch Oprah either, but I do have my opinions on HRT.      I had a hysterectomy in my late 40's.  I thought I was going nuts before I had it due to hormone fluctuations or lack of.  I've been on some form of HRT since then, but about 3 or 4 years ago, I opted for bio-identical HRT.  I prefer the pellets which are implanted under the skin.  I found, for the first time since my preteen era, I went migraine free.  I feel great, I feel comfortable about them and I think that as long as we have mammograms, breast exams and do self-breast exams, we're pretty safe.  Unless, of course, you happen to fall into a high risk category.      I think women need to have hormone levels checked who do take HRT, because I found out I wasn't absorbing the oral hormones.      I think it's always best to discuss options with your health care provider, who knows your condition best.|`|QdKvj3Exaa	I'm 59. I had a hysterectomy in 1994 and was put on HRT.

First, you should study the nature of man... There has always been a rebellious nature inside humans... and it erupted during many stages in life (the most serious case occurs during teenager years)... Rebellious nature is an opposing nature, where everything is to be challenged, every rule is to be broken and any other elements in life will be ignored. People with this nature usually focuses on breaking down systems without coming up with suitable solutions to remedy their damages... Although, this is regarded as selfish, they couldn't really do anything better...    As there is Christianity, there will be people who have a rebellious nature and decided to oppose it (i.e. Anti-Christianity). They insist that the religion is just bad (by picking out all the negative stuff in the Bible and challenging all actions that the priests do...) and that they are "free" (if you stop and think for a moment, the word is actually "carefree"... or "I don't want to live by rules")...

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

bFPjiwKpaa	Shaping your eyebrows is totally acceptable today. In fact, it is encouraged over the alternative; notice the word eyebrows is plural meaning two. Just be careful with this and only shape your eyebrows, do not over do it. Too many men are going too far with the tweezing and waxing of their eyebrows. Remember plucking is something you do to a chicken, not your brows. A gentle arch or removing the stray hairs is what you want to accomplish with this. Looking like a drag queen in between shows is not. Mens brows should be a little thick, without be bushy. Talk with a professional before you have this done, and for God sakes do not do it yourself. Let someone who know what they are doing do it. You may get one eyebrow looking great, but guarantee you will screw the other one up. Pay someone  you wont regret the results.|`|CDsLUCXUaa	i hope so or else you'll look like a monkey|`|3E2EQH12aa	not ok    Shaping the eyebrows by trimming, shaving or plucking their edges in order to appear beautiful, as is done by some women nowadays, is haraam because it involves changing the creation of Allaah and following the Shaytaan in his tempting of mankind to change the creation of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     Verily! Allaah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, has indeed strayed far away.    They (all those who worship others than Allaah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him, and they invoke nothing but Shaytaan, a persistent rebel!    Allaah cursed him. And he [Shaytaan] said: I will take an appointed portion of Your slaves;    Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah. And whoever takes Shaytaan as a wali (protector or helper) instead of Allaah, has surely suffered a manifest loss.    [Al-Nisa 4:116-119]    In al-Saheeh, it was reported that Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Allaah has cursed the women who do tattoos and those who have this done, the women who pluck eyebrows and those who have this done, and the women who file their teeth and change the creation of Allaah. Then he said: Should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed, when it says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):  And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he forbids you, abstain (from it) [al-Hashr 59:7]|`|8FbJjRpwaa	Blue eyed muslimah is right =D   dont bother shaping you will regret it there was a hadith saying the prophet pbuh will put a curse on those who does others or theirs!  you dont want that right?  keep it natural trust me be a proper muslimah; leads to getting noor (light- well religious light) this makes you beautiful also keep ur personality nice and ur considered beautiful =D|`|vnty8yOgaa	acceptable|`|diaSqz8laa	it is clearly unacceptable for the person who gets it done as well as for the person doing the service.

God revealed these to Moses and wrote them on tablets of stone (Ex. 34:4,28; De. 4:13; 10:1-4). The stones were placed in the ark located in the holy of holies in the Tabernacle (Ex. 25:21; De. 10:4,5). The N.T. says the Ten Commandments are done away in Christ (2 Co. 3:1-18). The rule of life for the Christian is not the Ten Commandments, but the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. We are to put on Christ, not the Ten Commandments (Ro. 13:14; 2 Co. 3:17,18; Ga. 5:16-26).    The O.T. law was a temporary covenant: (1) It was given to prepare Israel for the coming of Christ (Ga. 3:19-25). (2) It is abolished with Christ's coming (2 Co. 3:6-17). (3) It was taken away when Christ died (Col. 2:14-17).    What was the law's purpose? (1) It was given to reveal sin and to show man that he is a guilty sinner before God (Ro. 3:19-20; 7:12-13; 1 Ti. 1:9-10). (2) It was given to bring men to Jesus Christ (Ga. 3:24-25).    Bible salvation refers to redemption from sin through the Lord Jesus Christ. Salvation refers to the Gospel. The book of Romans is an orderly presentation of the doctrine of salvation.    The need for salvation. (1) God is holy and punishes sin (Ro. 1:18). (2) Man is sinful and has broken God's law (Ro. 1:19--3:18). (3) Nothing man can do can earn him God's favor (Ro. 3:19,20).    The way of salvation. Salvation is the free gift of God's eternal blessing through the atonement of Jesus Christ. It is offered to all who will believe on Christ (Ro. 1:16,17; 3:22-30; 4:3-8,24; 10:8-13). It is through faith ALONE and grace ALONE, not by any admixture of grace and law (Ten Commandments), faith and works (Ro. 4:13-16; 11:6).    The security of salvation. The believer is (1) declared righteous (Ro. 5:1), has peace with God (Ro. 5:1), has a new standing in grace (Ro. 5:2), has assurance of eternal salvation (Ro. 5:2,9,10), enjoys God's watchcare (Ro. 5:3,4), has the earnest of the Holy Spirit (Ro. 5:5).     The place of works in salvation. Faith, and faith alone, is the door into God's wonderful salvation. Having been forgiven and blessed with eternal blessings in Christ, we begin to serve God with a thankful heart--not in order to be saved, not in order to perfect our salvation, but because we are already saved (Ro. 6-8).|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	you can't go to somewhere that doesn't exist|`|xpbu0fWHaa	If you believe such stuff.

James 2:10      So we have a definition of sin (transgression of God's Law which is the 10 commandments)  and the strictness of it (this could be elaborated even further). Now, when you look at these 2 standards you can conclude that we all have sinned and that sin deserves punishment according to the law. Unless there is a payment for that sin (kinda of like a payment of a fine for a crime committed).    Once that sin is paid for, it is done. Therefore, you have done nothing to enter into Heaven. Once redeemed, there is also nothing that you can do to release the grip of Christ.     It is not that the one redeemed doesn't stumble into that sin anymore.

ISome of these miracles happened after he could escape out of the Liberty Jail  After his escape from his Missouri imprisonment, the Prophet had begun purchasing tracts of land in and around Commerce as gathering places for the thousands who had fled Missouri and now needed a place to rebuild their lives. By July 1839, hundreds of Saints were camping in tents and wagons on the east side of the Mississippi River in Commerce, while others had found shelter in abandoned military barracks on the opposite side of the river in Montrose, Iowa. In this new home, the Saints worked to clear and drain the swampy land near the river. Many Church members were bitten by mosquitoes and fell seriously ill with malaria and other diseases. Some of the Saints died, and others were near death. Joseph and Emma Smith took so many into their log home to nurse that the Prophet gave up his bed to sleep outside in a tent.     On July 22, in the midst of the sickness that afflicted so many, the Saints witnessed what Elder Wilford Woodruff would call a day of Gods power. That morning the Prophet arose, called upon the Lord in prayer, and, being filled with the Spirit of the Lord, administered to the sick in his house, in the yard outside, and down by the river. He crossed the river and visited the home of Brigham Young in Montrose to give him a healing blessing. Then, in company with Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young, and other members of the Twelve, he continued on his mission of mercy among other Iowa Saints. Elder Woodruff recalled one of the most memorable healings of that day:     We crossed the public square, and entered Brother [Elijah] Fordhams house. Brother Fordham had been dying for an hour, and we expected each minute would be his last. I felt the power of God that was overwhelming his Prophet. When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham, and took him by the right hand.  He saw that Brother Fordhams eyes were glazed, and that he was speechless and unconscious.     After taking hold of his hand, [the Prophet] looked down into the dying mans face and said: Brother Fordham, do you not know me? At first he made no reply; but we could all see the effect of the Spirit of God resting upon him.     [Joseph] again said: Elijah, do you not know me? With a low whisper, Brother Fordham answered, Yes! The Prophet then said, Have you not faith to be healed?     The answer, which was a little plainer than before, was: I am afraid it is too late. If you had come sooner, I think I might have been. He had the appearance of a man awaking from sleep. It was the sleep of death. Joseph then said: Do you not believe that Jesus is the Christ? I do, Brother Joseph, was the response.     Then the Prophet of God spoke with a loud voice, as in the majesty of the Godhead: Elijah, I command you, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise and be made whole!     The words of the Prophet were not like the words of man, but like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the house shook from its foundation. Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from the dead. A healthy color came to his face, and life was manifested in every act. His feet were done up in [cornmeal] poultices. He kicked them off his feet, scattering the contents, and then called for his clothes and put them on. He asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and ate it; then put on his hat and followed us into the street, to visit others who were sick.    In a time of dire need, the Saints experienced an outpouring of the gift of healing at the hands of the Prophet.|`|vWbbNd6Baa	Yeah, he conned a whole slew of people.

jcrPpPvqaa	There is a terrible misconception being propagated  by a large number of so-called former believers. These "former believers" claim that they used to be Christians. But, due to some hardship or sinful desire, they were forced into walking away from God's grace. Some of them will even claim that they have acquired some new knowledge or revelation which proved that there is no such thing as God.         First it is important to distinguish between a true Christian and a person who claims to be a Christian. A true Christian is a person who has fully trusted in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. An authentic Christian is a person who has received the free gift of salvation obtained by the Sacrifice and Resurrection of Jesus Christ for their sin. Ephesians 2 Clearly shows those who are real Christians are created through Christ's work. Ephesians 4:30 says that the believer is sealed by God. The word sealed in this verse means a person is confirmed or authenticated and their salvation is beyond doubt.  A fake or imitation Christian is someone who goes through the religious motions of tradition and self righteousness in an effort to earn and maintain their salvation        Is it possible for someone who has been saved by God's grace to just walk away from God's mercy and deny their former beliefs forever? The answer is a resounding NO!  Scripture makes it abundantly clear....there is no such thing as an ex-Christian. If a person is truly a Christian, they will never depart from saving faith! If a believer were able to simply abdicate or relinquish their faith it would be impossible for them to ever be saved again! The writer of Hebrews wrote in chapter 6 verse 4-6 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,  6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.         A Christian will never become an ex-Christian. No one who has truly and fully trusted in Christ as Savior can ever deny Him. No one who has truly comprehended the depth of evil and sin which is present in our flesh or the terror of our sins consequences, will  permanently walk away from the love , grace, and mercy offered by Christ. The grace and mercy of God, will never be taken back by God. God is not like us mortals, who give and expect to profit from our gifts, who takes our gifts back if we do not benefit from our empty "generosity". God's gift of salvation is eternal, He choses to become our Father and we are made His children. You cannot stop being your paternal parents child, what makes you think that you can stop being God's child?          The only way there could ever be such a thing as an "ex Christian"  is if our salvation was dependent on our ability to hold onto Christ.The biblical fact is our salvation depends on Christ's ability to hold onto us!                     Romans 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	Respectfully, how would you know you had it to begin with?    The "saved" concept assumes far too much.|`|AA10166652	A Christian is a new creation. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! (2 Corinthians 5:17). This verse speaks of a person becoming an entirely new creature as a result of being in Christ. For a Christian to lose salvation, the new creation would have to be canceled and reversed.    No, a Christian cannot lose salvation. Nothing can separate a Christian from Gods love (Romans 8:38-39). Nothing can remove a Christian from Gods hand (John 10:28-29).    The most frequent objections to the belief that a Christian cannot lose salvation are: (1) what about those who are Christians and continually live an immoral lifestyle?  and  (2) what about those who are Christians but later reject the faith and deny Christ? The problem with these two objections is the assumption are Christians. (1) The Bible declares that a true Christian will not live a continually immoral lifestyle (1 John 3:6). (2) The Bible declares that anyone who departs the faith is demonstrating that he/she never truly was a Christian (1 John 2:19).      ? I hope this clears things up for you! ?|`|AA10014750	1. Yes  2. Yes|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Yes and yes|`|P6atY3xXaa	Yes, both are possible....That is why you can have your name blotted out of the book of life.    Rev. 22  KJV  19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.     Rev. 3  KJV  5He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.     You cannot get your name written in the book of life unless you are saved.  Your name cannot be blotted out, unless it is already written there.    Hence, the Bible teaching is to disfellowship an unrepentant sinner.  But they can get back in, reinstated when they correct the gross wrong.    1 Cor. 5:9-end of chap., Hebrews 10:26, 29.    Debbie|`|XN0cYCATaa	No, Scriptural proof ?    Hebrews 6:4-6, [4] "For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, [5] and have tasted the good scripture and the powers of the age to come, [6] and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to open shame.    This is one of the classic proof texts for forfeiting one's salvation. Most Calvinistic theologians have made this passage fit into their theology by claiming that the passage does not refer to believers. There are, however, some significant problems with attempting to do this. First, the text clearly says, "it is impossible to renew them again to repentance", the "them" referring to those who "have fallen away". If the Calvinistic theologians interpretation is correct, then the text says that it is impossible for those who never actually became believers (repented, believed and thereby received the Holy Spirit), to repent and become believers. This seems to be inconsistent with God's mercy (2 Pet. 3:9; Matt. 11:28). It also seems to contradict the entire 18th chapter of Ezekiel, particularly verses 21-23. In addition, Jesus is clearly the object of the "elementary teachings" (verses 5:11 & 6:1), so saying that this passage refers to unbelieving Jews really stretches the concept of consistent interpretation.    Second, Calvinistic theologians attempt to make a definitive case that the words used in verses 4 and 5 do not denote someone who is a believer. First, this does not fit the context. Starting in chapter 5, verse 11 and 12 the writer of Hebrews makes the case that he is talking to believers who "have become dull of hearing". He goes on to say that they have reverted from the solid food of the "word of righteousness" and are turning back to "milk". Continuing in 5:13-14 and into the first 3 verses of chapter 6, the author continues to exhort the Hebrew believers to move on to maturity in the faith. This whole context is a lead in to the warning against "falling away" in verse 6. Again the question must be asked, falling away from what? Can a believer fall away from a faith he does not possess? We are given the answer in verse 4 and 5. The issue then becomes, do verses 4 and 5 describe believers?    The key to finding an answer to this falls in an area that all students of the scripture can agree upon - that the best source of evidence for unclear terms is found in the surrounding contextual uses of the terms in dispute. In regard to those who have once been "enlightened", see Heb. 10:32 which says, "But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings, partly, by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations..."[italic mine] This text and line of thought concludes in verse 39, and the context makes it clear that the writer is referring to believers. It would be extremely difficult to try to make a case saying that those spoken about in this passage (Heb. 10:32-39) - who had at one time were unenlightened, but subsequently became "enlightened" - were not believers. The epistle to the Hebrews itself defines what "being enlightened" means, and it means being a believer, as 10:32 makes clear. In addition, passages like Ephesians 1:18 add weight to this argument. Eph. 1:18-19 says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe." Here the same Greek word used in Heb. 6:4 & 10:32 is used to describe the heart of a believer i.e. an enlightened heart.    The next phrase describing the subjects of Heb. 6:4-6 are, those who "have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit". John 4:10, Acts 8:20 and other passages referring to the gift of God strongly indicate that the "heavenly gift" is the Holy Spirit. Regarding the term "tasted", Calvinistic theologians like to argue that "tasting" doesn't necessarily mean "eating" or "ingesting". This argument is put forth in an effort to attempt to avoid the possibility that the term means receiving the Holy Spirit. However, even a taste, if it is not spit out (which this text doesn't indicate) concludes with ingesting. Again, searching for the nearest context to get a sense of the word, "tasted", we find Heb. 2:9 which says, "...that by the grace of God He [Jesus] might taste death for everyone". Jesus did in fact experience total physical death and the term "tasted" here means fully experiencing total physical death on the behalf of all sinners. Here, tasted doesnt mean that Jesus barely died or experienced just a little bit of death. Rather, it means that Jesus willingly choose to experience death on behalf of sinners - he fully tasted it in order to cons|`|FbOkPyEpaa	It's impossible to lose something that does not exist.

The argument has always been once saved always saved, everyone backslides but Jesus said all sins are forgiven except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. For those who don't know what that means it is simply- when you do something that is wrong and you know it in your heart and soul and mind it grieves the Holy Spirit. This is the unpardonable sin, if this sin is bad enough to cost you your salvation then yes you lose it. But if you repent of the sin and God sees in your heart you are sincere you can regain your salvation, all sin are forgiven if you confess them and repent. This does not give you license to sin and you cant bounce back adn forth cause there is a limit to what God will tolerate, ex: Sodom and Gomorrah, and those folks alive at the time of Noah's flood. final thought- God knows your heart even when you don't.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. Yes can loose their salvation after believing and then making a choice of denying Jesus Christ as their saviour. If they do not ask for forgiveness. They have lost Salvation. Peace|`|9mLjDa5kaa	It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).     If you think you can lose or "leave" salvation, then you might not be saved at all. Because Jesus gives ETERNAL life, not "temporary" or "probationary" life. So if you think you can lose it, then you don't understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Instead, what you have is a false gospel of works, and no false gospel will get you into heaven (Galatians 1:6-9).     In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he is not yet born again. A person cannot believe in Christ alone for his eternal destiny and also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Yes and yes.|`|UujliMsCaa	Yes and yes.    You are saved by faith, therefore to lose faith is to lose _______.  If you can see the error of your ways once, couldn't you see once again that you need to restore that faith?    EDIT:  To those who say "you were never saved to begin with if you walk away from the faith" - Boy that sounds an awful lot like judging motives and the heart (which I thought only God can do).  I was saved. REALLY truly saved. Walking in the light. Not just "shaking preachers hands" or "going to church" but fully committed to Christ. I fell away. It happens. I found my way back into relationship with Christ.     - If being a Christian is having a "RELATIONSHIP" with the Father through Jesus, then couldn't you walk away from that relationship just the same as any other relationship? Adam and Eve did and they were made perfect!|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Truth is,  MOST of these answers are all variations on the same basic concept, just stated differently.    Think about it..  Once Saved Always savers point to verses which say how a TRUE Christian would act, and therefore conclude a TRUE Christian can not loose their salvation because they would never do anything to jeopardize it.  -- well this is true in THEORY, but doesn't reflect reality much.     TRUE-er STILL,  God will not abandon you and Jesus's salvation covers all sins.    So what they say is TRUE in a sense... albeit overly optomistic and possibly arrogant.  They don't make much allowance for NORMAL human mistakes,  they just say, "Well you weren't really a christian."    So they are correct in a sense.    Likewise, the "Faith-aloners"  are correct in that FAITH is MOST important and they correctly point out that Jesus's sacrifice, though completely sufficient to account for all our sins,  only gets APPLIED to those who have ACCEPTED his gift of salvation.  Furthermore, only the sins you ask forgiveness for are forgiven.  You can't get saved on Monday and do whatever you want and have your sins forgiven,  you have to ASK for forgiveness for Jesus's saving grace to be applied to it.    Those who believe in Faith-alone, ALSO believe that after you are saved, God will work in your life to make you desire to do good works.  The works are not the KEY, but they are merely a natural part of having faith.  "Faith in action" is their catch phrase.     Their way of stating it allows people to sin, ask for forgiveness, walk away from God, come back to him, etc.  Much more dynamic.  Much more realistic with how we SEE people living their lives.       Lastly you have the Catholic view of salvation. If it had a catch phrase it would be "faith working thru love"   The Catholic view is merely that none of us know if we are saved or not.  There is not "I'm saved" mentality.  We are ALL just living our faith, each and everyday, doing our best to LIVE the life God wants us to.  Obeying his rules, doing the type of things he'd do if he was here (basically love and charity) and leaving the final judgement up to God.   Many religions SINCE the Protestant Reformation have said that Catholicism is a "works based religion"  -- but really it is just a different way of stating things. Where as Faith Aloners state that FAITH is key and works not as important.  Catholics merely don't make that arbritary distinction. IF Faith is important, and works are the natural consequence, then the 2 are intrinsically linked and are essentially one in the same. I have faith because I act.  I act because I have faith. Catholics don't assume they are saved. They just keep doing their best.. day in and day out. Asking God for forgiveness and trying not to screw up again. Catholics ask God, then tell their priest everything,  making confession of sins a PUBLIC thing, eliminating the outward signs of holiness.  There's is a more humble way of living their life. Never knowing, always asking for help, always believing.  -- OR  "Faith working thru love"  -- Another wards...Faith, doing its work, thru the love one feels in their heart.     So you see each emphasizes its OWN particular aspect of salvation.   OSASers (Once Saved always Saved) can come off judgemental and unrealistic, and their way seems unfair.  BUT they truly trust in God, to an almost unrealistic stance. -- Which isn't a bad thing  Faith Aloners emphasize faith so they don't get arrogant about their works, which they believe count for nothing.  However, they can sometimes rely PURELY on faith and not put their faith in action. -- So their view is good, but has a flaw as well.  Catholics are non-judgemental and leave it ALL up to God. They have faith, but their faith means they can't know if they are "saved" or not. They are the "hard workers" of the group. However, their shortcoming is that they sometimes rely too much on the work and not enough on the faith.. or at least that is the view from the outside.     So each has its specialization and its shortcoming.     The key is that any one of them CAN potentially lead to eventual salvation, since they all express different aspects of the same concept. However,  you need to avoid the excesses of each. You need to not fall into the pitfalls of each. You need to be BALANCED in your approach.    I will mostly get thumbs down from for this..but I truly believe that MOST Christians are just quibbling over semantics, over different ways of stating the same thing. IF you don't live any one of these doctrines to an extreme.. anyone of them can eventually lead to salvation. -- The problems is that most people go to an extreme, which is the problem.     PERSONALLY I think the Catholic view is least arrogant and most compassionate. It ALSO happened to be the FIRST and the only for like nearly 1500 years. The Faith aloners are a branch off from the Catholic view. The OSASers are a branch off from the Faith Aloners. - So each one reflects an aspect of the truth, albeit just a different variation of it.  _____    Lastly, HOW do you regain your salvation?      By having faith and accepting Christ's gift again. Saying a prayer and making a mental change, by amending your ways and avoiding temptation, etc.  You basically turn away from those things which led you astray and focus back on God again. Asking for specific forgiveness for the things you did wrong.    Since I'm Catholic I can't tell you if you are immediately SAVED, as that is a past tense word and humans don't make that determination, God does.  He will do this when you die, therefore,  I can't tell you if you are saved or not. I CAN say that you are forgiven and have a relationship with God again.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	The mentally ill often relapse.

zQyslfHKaa	It actually works the other way around.    When I was younger I convinced myself that my parents were right and that God existed.  As I grew older, and became exposed to information, and reason, I started to realize that my hopes for God were just hopes, and my evidense for his existence were just things I was willing to apply to a God, instead of real evidense.    It is exceedingly rare to find a former Atheist.  Most of the Christians who claim it, will admit, that they were rebelling against God while they were Atheists, which shows that they weren't Atheists at all.|`|H7L66ynJaa	One can but hope and pray for this.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I doubt that a significant percentage will.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?

drxspOUwaa	From a mom with five kids ( two who had anger issues resulting from their birth families.)  You lash out or hurt others because You are hurting. Honey, I don't think you like yourself. That's why everyone uses anger - even if they only use it at home.( and using it only at home is, to me, a more chicken way than your public displays.

4DEVVRlIaa	So basically what Spirited and Kanien are saying is that even if you have proof of having an ancestor or two in your family tree that were native american, you should erase that because of what they seem to think on this subject.    Well, I disagree with them.    You can't erase an ancestor just to make a few people happy who aren't obviously happy in their lives. So now they force their opinions on you.     Don't let a very small few make you ashamed of who are apart of your family tree. Celebrate who among your family tree you have come from. As long as you are happy, what does it really matter what a small few say.    My advice, pursue what you are after. And if someone disagrees. You say you disagree with them and walk away. It's the right thing to do and the mature thing as well.     As for taking, well....where is the proof? Can they prove it? Most likely not. They obviously have issues they choose not to face for whatever their reason. So it is that those small few then take on the bully role and try to bully those they deem to be weaker. If you are out to just learn where you came from, so you have a better understanding of where you are going. Good. I applaud you in your efforts. It is better to give then receive.

Regarding Blackfoot, the only BlackfEEt ("ee" not "oo") tribe in the US is in Montana: http://www.blackfeetnation.com/.  If your family does not come from Montana or Canada it is unlikely you're BlackfEEt.  Many people from mostly the southeastern part of the US claim to be BlackfOOt which is totally unrelated to the BlackfEEt of Montana/Canada.  The term "black foot" is still being deciphered and has been suggested to be used to describe people who were mixed Black/White or Black/Native-tribe unknown.

E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

jQ5pz7BYaa	The only verse I could find is Galatians 5:19 "uncleanness" and this is not a very well defined word.  So it may not even apply.  Personally since it may possibly be allowed for a husband and wife I would consider it an unnatural act.  Also that kind of act may lead to sex of the same kind. It would be something that should be avoided.  And if in doubt play it safe.  It is you SOUL  that may be at RISK and possibly your physical health.  But anyway I do not know and I did search the Bible and the net. It is a good question I hoped I was of help.|`|qKwVVVDraa	I think this truly depends on your faith and your interpretation of the Bible.   The majority of christians would probably believe this is sinful.      I always thought that Sodom and Gomorrah mentioned homosexuality rather than anal intercourse with the opposite sex, but I am not a Bible scholar.  Perhaps you should research that story first.        Dictionary definition...    Sodomy    Etymology: Middle English, from Anglo-French sodomie, from Late Latin Sodoma Sodom; from the homosexual proclivities of the men of the city in Genesis 19:111   Date: 13th century   : anal or oral copulation with a member of the same or opposite sex ; also : copulation with an animal|`|gRObakpZaa	No, it is not allowed and considered sodomy.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	no its not   1 reason is because the anus is an exit for you no what not an entrance. lol

jbDTsZyBaa	They just have it like that. Most people know this even though they can't tell you why. And they'll jump on you for saying anything about it because that's what they've been taught to do. To say ANYTHING bad about  ANY Jews is  somehow akin to saying the holocaust was a good thing.    See? Do you think most people will ever realize that they've been programmed, that their minds are not truly their own? You can curse God Himself and be praised for it, but never Jews under any circumstances. Even anti-religious people won't stand for it.    And of course there have never been any conspiracies of any kind in all of human history, lol (or only in hindsight and after official verification). To believe in them as they are occurring makes you a coo coo bird!|`|143bm6cnaa	Jews make up about 2% of the population and you want to credit them - and blame them - for everything.

DJLeObm4aa	Excellent help and support is provided in UK. However, I am led to believe it can depend in the area you live as to how good the quality of that care is. My dad is over 90 yrs old. His mind is alert but his mobility extremely bad and has other health issues. I am in Scotland and here we get free personal care for our elderly. My dad has carers come in 4 times a day, 7 days a week. Showering, dressing, making meals, putting him to bed at night etc is all free. (I think there may be a charge in other parts of UK). They also do cleaning, washing, ironing and cooking and depending on your circumstances is what you pay. In my dad's case he pays 63 per month. In addition to this from another channel of Social Services someone comes in Mon - Fri to shave him and this person is allocated 1 1/2 hrs per week to take him on an outing. He is perm. catheterised and a nurse from his GP surgery visits once a week to check on this. He has his State Pension and a very small monthly works pension and receives Attendance Allow and Severe Disabilment Allowance.  AAs is not a  means tested benefit and not counted towards income which means he is still entitled to Pension Credits to supplement his pension and having these he can get free dental, optical treatment etc. Although usually done by a hospital referral, from the Occupational Therapists he has had alsorts of alterations, euqipment put in his home to aid him and several types of walking aids and a wheelchair. About 3 years ago a complete 'wet floor' bathroom, shower, fully tiled walls was also installed in his home at no cost to him whatsoever. I certainly think he has care second to none. I do imagine at his age and nearest family being 25 miles away he is a priority but he has never had to ask for any of these things but have been organised by hospitals he attends, his GP or whatever. He had worked hard all his life at low paid menial jobs so does deserve this. Unfortunately, where I live although same care available I have heard it said that those in need have to fight hard to get it. If you or someone close to you requires care and unsure how to go about it I would suggest you speak with a Welfare Rights Officer (often within Social Services) who would advise and assist with any forms you may requie to complete. Hope this has helped as I presume you are not referring to care in a care home?|`|zdu3gh8jaa	There is all manner of support that can be offered, some has to be paid for depending on circumstances, other types are free. Contact the local social services, council, help the aged, age concern, disability uk and other support or informstion services for further help and advice with your enquiry.    Hope this helps.|`|9f8XoDKJaa	Lots and Lots.. Talk to local Council about it.

The spiritual orders are divided into four asramas--brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa--and the social orders, according to work and qualification, are made up of the brahmanas, the ksatriyas, the vaisyas and the sudras. These social orders, according to the different grades of work and qualification, are described in Bhagavad-gita. Unfortunately, for want of proper protection by responsible kings, the system of social and spiritual orders has now become a hereditary caste system. But this is not the actual system. Human society means that society which is making progress toward spiritual realization. The most advanced human society was known as arya; arya refers to those who are advancing. So the question is, "Which society is advancing?" Advancement does not mean creating material "necessities" unnecessarily and thus wasting human energy in aggravation over so-called material comforts. Real advancement is advancement toward spiritual realization, and the community which acted toward this end was known as the Aryan civilization. The intelligent men, the brahmanas, as exemplified by Kardama Muni, were engaged in advancing the spiritual cause, and ksatriyas like Emperor Svayambhuva used to rule the country and insure that all facilities for spiritual realization were nicely provided. It is the duty of the king to travel all over the country and see that everything is in order. Indian civilization on the basis of the four varnas and asramas deteriorated because of her dependency on foreigners, or those who did not follow the civilization of varnasrama. Thus the varnasrama system has now been degraded into the caste system.     The institution of four varnas and four asramas is confirmed herewith to be bhagavad-racita, which means "designed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead." In Bhagavad-gita this is also confirmed: catur-varnyam maya srstam. The Lord says that the institution of four varnas and four asramas "is created by Me." Anything created by the Lord cannot be closed or covered. The divisions of varnas and asramas will continue to exist, either in their original form or in degraded form, but because they are created by the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be extinguished. They are like the sun, a creation of God, and therefore will remain. Either covered by clouds or in a clear sky, the sun will continue to exist. Similarly, when the varnasrama system becomes degraded, it appears as a hereditary caste system, but in every society there is an intelligent class of men, a martial class, a mercantile class and a laborer class. When they are regulated for cooperation among communities according to the Vedic principles, then there is peace and spiritual advancement. But when there is hatred and malpractice and mutual mistrust in the caste system, the whole system becomes degraded, and as stated herein, it creates a deplorable state. At the present moment, the entire world is in this deplorable condition because of giving rights to so many interests. This is due to the degradation of the four castes of varnas and asramas.    SB 6.16.43 P   King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord     Bhagavata-dharma means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. Again, the Puranas and other Vedic literatures set forth four asramas, which are the divisions of spiritual life. Therefore bhagavata-dharma means the varnasrama-dharma of the four social and four spiritual divisions.     The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of bhagavata-dharma and live according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called Aryans or arya. A civilization of Aryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and other living entities. panditah sama-darsinah: because they are completely educated in Krsna consciousness, they see all living beings equally. Aryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also, all for sense gratification. This is not an Aryan civilization. As stated here, sthira-cara-sattva-kadambesv aprthag-dhiyah. The word aprthag-dhiyah indicates that Aryans do not distinguish between lower and higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and plants. This is the basic principle of an Aryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras. The brahmanas should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as stated in Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be guna and karma. In other words, one should acquire the qualities of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra and act accordingly. This is the civilization accepted by the Aryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very much eager to satisfy Krsna. This is perfect civilization.     Aryans do not deviate from the instructions of Krsna, nor do they have doubts about Krsna, but non-Aryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living entities. Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: their only b|`|mrI8mfFpaa	HINDUISM...

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

mOWyzwubaa	The Dividers of Deen e Islam. and feud among them.    Imam Muhammad bin Ishaq (famous for writing the first biography of the exalted Prophet said: Imam Maalik is a liar. (Jaame Bayanil Ilm pg 198)  I  mam Maalik said: Imam Muhammad bin Ishaq is Dajjal (Anti-Christ). (Jaame pg 198)    Imam Amash said to Imam Abu Hanifah: I cant stand you even in your own home. (Pg 199)  Imam Abu Hanifah said: Imam Amash neither observes Saum nor does he take the post-coital bath. (Pg 199)  Imam Abu Hanifah said: Imam Jabir Al-Jafi is a great forger.  Imam Saeed bin Musaib and Imam Hasan Basari called Ikramah a liar and Ikramah said the same about those two. (Ppg 197-198)  Imam Qatadah considered Imam Yahya bin Katheer a fabricator and the latter thought the same of the former. (Pg 199)    Imam Saleh Al-Marri said: Imam Hammad is a big liar. (Fathul Mulhim pg 138)  Imam Yazeed bin Haroon said: Imam Ziyad bin Maimoon keeps changing the chains of narration. (Fathul pg 139)  Imam Ubaidullah bin Maaz said: Write nothing from Qazi Abi Shaibah (Fathul pg 138)  Imam Abu Jafar Al-Hashmi said: Imam Umro bin Ubaid is a liar. (Fathul pg 137)  The first ever man to collect the names and details of (5 million!) narrators, was Imam Yahya bin Moeen. Imam Shaafii said: He is absolutely unreliable. (Kitab fi Dhufa,Jaame Mukhtasir pg 201) Does it not demolish the whole house of cards?  Imam Jabir bin Yazeed said: I own 70,000 Ahadith the narrator of all of which is one man, Abu Jafar. [Now do what you can!]    Note: This entire feud is going on in early 2nd century AH.    Where is the True Islam? Imagine the five million phantom players (raavis or narrators) and 1.4 million Ahadith dumped on the Quran! No wonder, the True Islam remains unseen and unclaimed under this massive baggage.    Questionable Hadith in Bukhari tells us that during his terminal illness, the Prophet said, "Bring the writing material for me to pen for you something that you may never go astray after me."   Umar immediately responded, "Hasbuna Kitaabullah" (Sufficient for us is the Book of Allah).  This sounds like a breach of respect on the part of Hazrat Umar. In my humble understanding, the Prophet would never say anything like this after the Quran had clearly stated that it is a detailed, complete and perfected book and: "This day I have perfected your Deen for you"(5:3)  On the contrary, the Prophet commanded, La taktabu anni ghair-al-Quran; wa mun kataba anni ghair-al-Quran falyamhah. (Write from me nothing but the Quran and if anyone has written, it must be obliterated.)  The Prophet commanded, La taktabu anni ghair-al-Quran; wa mun kataba anni ghair-al-Quran falyamhah. (Write from me nothing but the Quran and if anyone has written, it must be obliterated.) - Saheeh Muslim, vol 1 pg 211 Hadith number 594, Printer  Maktaba Adnan, Beirut 1967.    As the Prophet (S) commanded, Hazrat Abu Bakr burned his collection of 500 Ahadith  (Tazkarah-tul-Haffaaz by Imam Zahabi). Following this lead, Hazrat Umar commanded  the Sahaba to go home and return with their collections of Hadith. Then the entire stack  was set ablaze. (Tabaqat Ibn Sad vol 5 pg140) He said, There have been communities  before you that wrote books of prophetic sayings. But then, they abandoned Divine  Revelation and adhered to those man-made books. By God! I will not let this happen to  the Kitabullah (Quran).

The believers are but a single brotherhood/sisterhood. (49:10).    As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no part in them in the least. (6:159).    Islam binds the hearts of all believers and joins us in one Ummah.  It protects us against weakness and disunity, and against failure and defeat.  The objective of the united Ummah of the believers is to worship Allaah, to deeper-form duwa to Allaah, and to work for the realisation of the deen of Allaah. The bond that binds the members of this Ummah is Iman.  It is, and should be, stronger than all other bonds such as race, colour, or national origin.  It is even stronger than blood relationships.  The stronger the Iman, the stronger is the bond between the members of the Ummah.    I feel ashamed to say that my brothers and sisters are no longer part of the One Ummah. Rather, there are several Ummahs. Nauzobillah. But Allaah knows best.|`|5sMZrmqjaa	even i thinks that may be 4power money etc  read this  www.irf.net  1.   Muslims Should be United      It is a fact that Muslims today, are divided amongst themselves. The tragedy is that such divisions are not endorsed by Islam at all. Islam believes in fostering unity amongst its followers.     The Glorious Quran says:    "And hold fast,  All together, by the rope  Which Allah (stretches out for you),   and be not divided among yourselves;"                  [Al-Quran 3:103]    Which is the rope of Allah that is being referred to in this verse? It is the Glorious Quran. The Glorious Quran is the rope of Allah which all Muslims should hold fast together. There is double emphasis in this verse. Besides saying hold fast all together it also says, be not divided.    Quran further says,    "Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger"                  [Al-Quran 4:59]    All the Muslim should follow the Quran and authentic Ahadith and be not divided among themselves.       2.   It is Prohibited to make sects and divisions in Islam      The Glorious Quran says:     "As for those who divide  Their religion and break up  Into sects, thou hast  No part in them in the least:  Their affair is with Allah:  He will in the end   Tell them the truth  Of all that they did."             [Al-Quran 6:159]    In this verse Allah (swt) says that one should disassociate oneself from those who divide their religion and break it up into sects.    But when one asks a Muslim, "who are you?", the common answer is either I am a Sunni, or I am a Shia. Some call themselves Hanafi, or Shafi or Maliki or Humbali. Some say I am a Deobandi, while some others say I am a Barelvi.       3.   Our Prophet was a Muslim      One may ask such Muslims, "Who was our beloved prophet (pbuh)? Was he a Hanafi or a Shafi, or a Humbali or a Maliki?" No! He was a Muslim, like all the other prophets and messengers of Allah before him.     It is mentioned in chapter 3 verse 52 of Al-Quran that Jesus (pbuh) was a Muslim.     Further, in chapter 3 verse 67, Al-Quran says that Ibrahim (pbuh) was not a Jew or a Christian but was a Muslim.      4.   Quran says call yourselves Muslim      If anyone poses a Muslim the question who are you, he should say "I am a MUSLIM, not a Hanafi or a Shafi". Surah Fussilat chapter 41 verse 33 says  "Who is better in speech  Than one who calls (men)  To Allah, works righteousness,  And says, I am of those  Who bow in Islam (Muslim)? "                 [Al-Quran 41:33]    The Quran says "Say I am of those who bow in Islam". In other words, say, "I am a Muslim".    The Prophet (pbuh) dictated letters to non-Muslim kings and rulers inviting them to accept Islam. In these letters he mentioned the verse of the Quran from Surah Ali Imran chapter 3 verse 64:  Say ye: "Bear witness  That we (at least)  Are Muslims (bowing  To Allahs Will)."                  [Al-Quran 3:64]      5.   Respect all the Great Scholars of Islam      We must respect all the great scholars of Islam, including the four Imaams, Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Shafi, Imam Humbal and Imam Malik (may Allah be pleased with them all). They were great scholars and may Allah reward them for their research and hardwork. One can have no objection if someone agrees with the views and research of Imam Abu Hanifa or Imam Shafi, etc. But when posed a question, who are you?, the reply should only be I am a Muslim.    Some may argue by quoting the hadith of our beloved Prophet from Sunan Abu Dawood Hadith No. 4579. In this hadith the prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said, "My community will be split up into seventy-three sects."    This hadith reports that the prophet predicted the emergence of seventy-three sects. He did not say that Muslims should be active in dividing themselves into sects. The Glorious Quran commands us not to create sects. Those who follow the teachings of the Quran and Sahih Hadith, and do not create sects are the people who are on the true path.     According to Tirmidhi Hadith No. 171, the prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said, "My Ummah will be fragmented into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in Hell fire except one sect." The companions asked Allahs messenger which group that would be. Where upon he replied, "It is the one to which I and my companions belong."    The Glorious Quran mentions in several verses, "Obey Allah and obey His Messenger". A true Muslim should only follow the Glorious Quran and the Sahih Hadith. He can agree with the views of any scholar as long as they conform to the teachings of the Quran and Sahih Hadith. If such views go against the Word of Allah, or the Sunnah of His Prophet, then they carry no weight, regardless of how learned the scholar might be.    If only all Muslims read the Quran with understanding and adhere to Sahih Hadith, Inshallah most of these differences would be solved and we could be one united Muslim Ummah|`|c6ONQhoyaa	I agree there should not be any sects.        peace :)

The killers were New England Puritan Christians,  refugees from persecution in their own home country England.    *When however, a dead colonist was found, apparently killed by  Narragansett Indians, the Puritan colonists wanted revenge. Despite  the Indian chief's pledge they attacked.    Somehow they seem to have lost the idea of what they were after,  because when they were greeted by Pequot Indians (long-time foes of  the Narragansetts) the troops nevertheless made war on the Pequots and  burned their villages.    The puritan commander-in-charge John Mason after one massacre wrote  "And indeed such a dreadful Terror did the Almighty let fall upon  their Spirits, that they would fly from us and run into the very  Flames, where many of them perished ... God was above them, who  laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to Scorn, making  them as a fiery Oven ... Thus did the Lord judge among the Heathen,  filling the Place with dead Bodies" men, women, children. [SH113-114]  *So "the Lord was pleased to smite our Enemies in the hinder Parts,  and to give us their land for an inheritance".

Slave deaths due to the founding fathers 30-60 million.    African American Slavery    In American Holocaust (1992), David Stannard estimates that some 30 to 60 million Africans died being enslaved. He claims a 50% mortality rate among new slaves while being gathered and stored in Africa, a 10% mortality among the survivors while crossing the ocean, and another 50% mortality rate in the first "seasoning" phase of slave labor. Overall, he estimates a 75-80% mortality rate in transit.    In Slavery A World History, Milton Meltzer estimates that 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas. This would be the residue after 12.5% of those shipped out from Africa died on the ocean, 4-5% died while waiting in harbor, and 33% died during the first year of seasoning.    In "The Atlantic Slave Trade and the Holocaust" (Is the Holocaust Unique, A. Greebaum, ed., 1996), Seymour Drescher estimates that 21M were enslaved, 1700-1850, of which 7M remained in slavery inside Africa. 4M died "as a direct result of enslavement". Of the 12M shipped to America, 15%, or 2M more, died in the Middle Passage and seasoning year.    Jan Rogozinski, A Brief History of the Caribbean (1994): "[A]s many as eight million Africans may have died in order to bring four million slaves to the Caribbean islands."    In The Slave Trade, Hugh Thomas estimates that 13M left African ports, and 11,328,000 arrived.    Biblical Atrocities    * Exodus 32: 3,000 Israelites killed by Moses for worshipping the golden calf.  * Numbers 31: After killing all men, boys and married women among the Midianites, 32,000 virgins remain as booty for the Israelites. (If unmarried girls are a quarter of the population, then 96,000 people were killed.)  * Joshua:  o Joshua 8: 12,000 men and women, all the people of Ai, killed.  o Joshua 10: Joshua completely destroys Gibeon ("larger than Ai"), Makeddah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, Debir. "He left no survivors."  o Joshua 11: Hazor destroyed. [Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews (1987), estimates the population of Hazor at ?> 50,000]  o TOTAL: if Ai is average, 12,000 x 9 = 108,000 killed.  * Judges 1: 10,000 Canaanites k. at Battle of Bezek. Jerusalem and Zephath destroyed.  * Judges 3: ca. 10,000 Moabites k. at Jordan River.  * Judges 8: 120,000 Midianite soldiers k. by Gideon  * Judges 20: Benjamin attacked by other tribes. 25,000 killed.  * 1 Samuel 4: 4,000 Isrealites killed at 1st Battle of Ebenezer/Aphek. 30,000 Isr. k. at 2nd battle.  * David:  o 2 Samuel 8: 22,000 Arameans of Damascus and 18,000 Edomites killed in 2 battles.  o 2 Samuel 10: 40,000 Aramean footsoldiers and 7,000 charioteers killed at Helam.  o 2 Samuel 18: 20,000 Israelites under Absalom killed at Ephraim.  * 1 Kings 20: 100,000 Arameans killed by Israelites at Battle of Aphek. Another 27,000 killed by collapsing wall.  * 2 Chron 13: Judah beat Israel and inflicted 500,000 casualties.  * 2 Chron 25: Amaziah, king of Judah, k. 10,000 from Seir in battle and executed 10,000 POWs.

It was a blood lust of the worst kind.    However, let's make one thing clear:  all wars are about power and money.  Religion is only used as a way to motivate and unify the people.

The Salem Witch Trials in early America were also carried out in the name of Christ and were wrong. There were those in the South who defended their slavery practices with the Bible, and the KKK still uses it, but that doesn't make them representative Christians. While many people will list the Crusades, I personally think they were legitimate. I notice that some people also listed the Holocaust, but Hitler was just as hateful to the church before the end of it all. Those people could not have been Christian and done that.

AA10259854	I think Scientology is the most fake, as it was invented by L Ron Hubbard to prove that religion is profitable.  The only basis of its teachings is/was Hubbard's fertile imagination.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	the most profitable of all is scientology. if it had the same number of followers than christianity..|`|AA11297267	Catholics did the best for a very long time, controlling entire nations and empires, collecting booty from explorations of the "new" world, and funneling billions into Rome.  Once they got kicked out of government in most places, they haven't fared as well, though the donations of the "faithful" are still a pretty good business.    Lately, the Mormons and the Scientologists are probably doing the best business.  Mormons *require* that every member give 10% of their income annually.  That's not a suggestion, not just encouraged, it's absolutely required.  When you add the newspapers, tv stations, and other businesses the mormons own, they are by far the biggest business in religion.  Part of scientology's doctrine teaches that members must give money to progress in their theology.  As they have some high-income celebrity members, they do just fine.  They can't quite keep up with the mormons, though, since there are far fewer scientologists.    Peace.|`|Q79HtvJIaa	Atheism

IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God or Jesus. The Bible is fiction. Some people are just too stupid to realize that.|`|AA11849917	I do not believe in "god".  I do, however, believe in "God".    In my mid 20s, I had an encounter that totally and radically changed and revolutionized my life totally and completely.    I grew up in a home in which we were taught that Jesus was a liar, a deceiver, possibly a lunatic, but above all else, very definitely dead.    I have said it before, and I'll say it again, "It's amazing how that once you actually meet Someone, you can no longer deny His existence."    Having "met" Jesus (spiritually speaking), I can no longer deny His existence, and I would recommend that you reconsider your position.  You're too young to draw any final conclusions about ultimate Reality.  It's just your opinion that God doesn't exist, and for some reason, you don't want to even consider the possibility that He exists.    But He said, "If you seek for me, then you'll find me, if you search for me with all your heart (with an honest and humble heart), and I WILL be found of you, says the Lord."    He said He would, indeed, reveal Himself to the one who is willing to humble himself.  But He also indicated in His Word that He would hide Himself from the proud, the arrogant, the skeptic, the scoffer, and the mocker alike.    Don't be too hasty to make a decision that will affect you for all eternity, for "We shall ALL stand before the judgement seat of Christ."    Challenge, yes - wonder about everything - yes.  But don't discount God's call for your life to turn to Him and be saved from your sins, along with their eternal consequences, because God DOES Love you, and He does NOT want ANY to perish in hell forever!  That's why He sent Jesus, to seek out and save the lost.|`|OxnyOaxGaa	*    Yes I know God.    *|`|dvY6UfiYaa	No kind of deity exists.|`|BtFbHjHZaa	Good for you, Im glad you can think with reason and logic.

Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|cKuppxUQaa	I believe in God.|`|VHi7Kaokaa	yes i do !|`|hYzfzu9yaa	No. I do not believe in god.

AA11008046	What happens to the child is going to depend on how they live and whether or not they accept God as their Lord and Savior.  According to your description of events that child would no doubt go to Heaven.  You can't take old testament law and apply it to life after the cross of Christ.  They lived in the dispensation of Law.  We live in the dispensation of Grace.  There is huge differences in the word salvation between these two dispensations.  Also your are talking about the "assembly of the Lord" which would have been the synagogue in those days.  At the same time you are talking about the person going to Heaven or not.  The two are not relative.  Can't compare apples with oranges.|`|f2cadb13ef40dd19dbc25057af15104eaa	the same thing that happens to a child that is planned by a husband and wife,  Jesus remove the curse of the law, and we are under grace, not withstanding the law is a schoolmaster for us to learn by what happened to them in the law. every one is the same , jew , and greek, black and white and every thing in between. Jesus died for man kind.   hell was not made for man but the devil and his angles and all of us that except the gift of God ,,which is Jesus will go to heaven. if we keep his saying and love one another as He instructed us to do.    for EURYTHMI.  i read your answer and you answered very well and educated in the bible , i have a question for you,  how can you know so much about the bible and still not believe it,?     it seems to me at one point you were probably a christian,    what could have happened that would make you stop loving Jesus?|`|AA12194228	I hate that term. No child born in or out of wedlock should be called illegitimate. Maybe it's parents illegitimately produced an offspring. Their choice.   Oh yeah, that child will be judged when the time comes just like the rest of us.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	None of us are under the law of the Old Testament, so this doesn't apply. There are no children labeled "illegitamite" in the New Testament.  And notice that even in the Old Testament, it was regarding the assembly, not about salvation.     The only way into heaven for anyone, no matter who they are, is by faith alone in Jesus without works.  If any person dies without having believed this, then they are sent to hell, no matter who they are.|`|hKP5sQewaa	I believe they will still go to heaven. :]    But non of us can know for sure.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	We no longer live under the law, but are saved by grace.|`|4boTYkt7aa	It makes no difference how a person comes into this world,it is about what state their soul is in when they leave this world.|`|8IIVBPwkaa	Deuternonomy is in the Old Testament, and is talking about the time when all men were responsible for their own sin.    When Jesus came, God provided us with a way of removing sin from ourselves through believing in Him and putting Him at the centre of our lives - he then takes our sin upon Himself (he did this for us when he died on the cross - his was for every sin that had ever been committed and will ever be committed by humanity)    So now, whilst the Old Testament still contains some important messages for Christians, it contains some laws that are now not relevant. The one you mention is one of them. ANYONE who accepts Jesus and lives their life for Him will go to Heaven when they die.    Hope this helps.    By the way, I am an atheist, but I know my Bible and what Christian viewpoints are on things.|`|AA11995584	Children are not illegitimate, only the relationships that produce them.    The OT law you cite is a reference to relationships with people who did not worship Yahweh.  It is to keep pagan worship practices from entering God's Holy sanctuary.|`|rQEJATQgaa	I think, I THINK that they get stuck in Limbo, but Christians may not take Limbo literally|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Because, under the "old covenant", everything had to be humanly purified. Nothing impure could ever enter the temple. The problem with the old covenant is that it relied upon the promises and works of fallible humans to keep the Law.  But in the new covenant, the illegitimate child would be "cleansed" by the blood of Christ. It is still true that "nothing impure can enter Heaven", but Christ cleanses us and makes us pure by His blood, so that we may enter, no matter how bad our past sins were, or even if we were born of an illegitimate union.|`|3SWjKcAEaa	I thought the Lord is willing to forgive?|`|b5b22241b72a751e94c18311e3dd0dddaa	Too bad.

The bible does say we are born into sin but it also says we have a just God.  He know a baby can't ask for forgiveness on its own.  Parents have nothing to do with ones eternal destination.  Once you are older and you know about God it is up to you to make the decision to have a personal relationship with Christ.  Read the book of John, this is a good place to start.  You also need to keep in mind that the Old Testament had different ways to get to heaven.  When Jesus came and payed for our sins on the cross He became the only way to Eternity in Heaven.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	if you want to believe in a God that would be so evil (yes, evil) as to turn away a good person from heaven because their parents were not married, then go ahead.  My belief is, if there is even a heaven and a god he will take any one as long as they are a good person.  It won't matter if they are illegitmate or believers in him or church goers, what good would any of that be if you are a rotton person.    the bible passage sounds like on that some one will use to be judgemental|`|AA11849917	You ask "What happens to an illegitimate child when they die?" - good question.    The answer is, "The same as what happens to any other child when they die.  They go into the arms of a loving Savior, Jesus Christ, who welcomes them into heaven."    What makes a child legitimate or illigitamate - you need to ask yourself that question, because if one child is called "legitimate", then that implies that the other is not really a child - not really human - not really a person.  And if not, then what exactly ARE they?  They are legitimately human beings, made in the very image of God, with the potential of both heaven or hell, but as a child, only heaven.    Your quote of Deuteronomy is not about heaven or hell, it's about serving in the Jewish temple.  A child born out of wedlock can not represent God to the congregation.    This is because that sin is so desparately wicked, that it even affects the children - that's how bad sin is.  So, let's not denigrate "sin" to some kind of "mistake" or something.  Sin destroyed the world, it's destroying mankind, and it cost God His own Son!|`|IqqaA2wIaa	hell=grave....same for everybody...we all must repent first before we can have eTERnal life..

Israel is 60 years old.  The US is 230.      And Israel needs to defend herself from the constant onslaught of terrorism from every country around her.

Now, if you could just be satisfied to have what you want within your own borders, the rest of the world might be able to sleep peacefully at night, but that is contrary to whatever it is that you believe.

One of my students who is still underage told me that she would never be able to have children because something a man did to her when she was a baby. I asked her if the man was ever punished. She said that he was not punished for what he did to her, but he was serving 15 years for shaking a baby and the baby died.    Offenders are often repeat offenders.    Surgically. Just the top 2 inches.    2 inches more for any repeat offenses.

gqhoCu3faa	THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

However, without proof He still exists. he doesn't need you to recognize Him to exist.   Your statements have nothing to do with your question.  Man instinctively reaches out to a greater being. It is a matter of finding the right one, the true one.  After the Fall in the Garden, man got knocked down low on the spiritual totem pole.  Lower than a two bit lying fallen demon angel.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

Remember when we were taught F=ma in high school? Well it DOESN'T. It's not true at all. Force does NOT equal mass times acceleration.

They aren't saying it's actually flawed, only that they're skeptical of it.  Skepticism is good, that's how science progresses.  Skepticism is the reason we don't accept aether, as a valid model anymore.    If evolution is ever proven to be invalid as a scientific model, I will gladly stop accepting it.  Evidence still point to evolution, as the best explanation; until that changes, my grasp of biology is best served, by accepting evolution.|`|1Te4sfqIaa	First of all let me say that 600 "phd's" is a grain of sand on the beach compared to all the scientists in the world that do agree with evolution.  Like some of the other answerers said, look up project Steve.  In this, someone decided to get as many names as they could of people to support evolution but decided to narrow it down just to scientists whose names were Steve.  In it you will see that they even outnumber your 600 people.      Secondly just because you have a doctorate doesn't mean you are qualified to talk on evolution.  You have to have one in the correct field.    Thirdly, Theories by their nature are never perfect, and never completely proven.  They are only shown to be consistent with observed fact and useful for generating accurate predictions.  Newtonian physics did it, and then Einstein developed the Theory of Relativity which made even better predictions.  It basically improved upon the previous theory.      Now they are looking to unify that with quantum physics to generate even better predictions.      Evolution has been tested for 150 years and has shown to be highly accurate to the observed data and useful for generating predictions.  In essence it is the best we've got to explain the changes in species over time so it is what is used and accepted by the vast(99%) majority of scientists out there.
OuMhera8aa	I'm from the united states. Usually, you're not immediately boyfriend and girlfriend. You go on a date or two, (and you can be going on dates with other people too...) and then if you like each other, you both decide that you are only going to see... or date... each other. Then you date and blah blah... a week, month, year, years... and you get engaged. I've seen some people get engaged a month after they met each other, granted it doesn't always work out.
78Xb7enMaa	I agree with you in so far as Islam in particular meets many of the identifiers as listed in the link below.|`|f7jICJo2aa	A cult is a religion with not too many members, that's why they encourage their believers to have lots and lost of babies. See here a check list for cult like characteristics ..|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	swapping cult for one for another still leaves you trapped in a cult|`|hJX6Ur3taa	This main reason it is considered a cult by Christians is because Muslims deny that Jesus Christ is the Messiah.|`|AfdyNi9Raa	Organised religions, not just cults which are usually the small scale religious sects, were devised as a form of social control in the ancient times.  Men in power found they could make those under their power do what they wanted by invoking God, fear gulit etc.    Islam as on of the world's great religions seems little different to me|`|k4xmHdOAaa	Thanks for that "Choose me as the best answer"    I haven't laughed as hard in ages..............|`|PRbtcAHOaa	it is?!    haha i love the word islamics, Lion of Judah    maybe i should use it to distance my self from all those 'muslim' fundamentalists :)|`|PShlj7Lxaa	When I was  Muslim I didn't see it as a cult and I still don't but, when I explained to my boyfriend  the things I had to do, he said that he saw it as a cult.|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	Hmm... I doubt you were a Muslim.     You see we pray like the Prophets(peace be upon them) did. See:    Genesis 17:3  "And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him"    Joshua 7:6  "And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face"    Numbers 16:22   "And they(Moses and Aaron) fell upon their faces"    Numbers 20:6  "And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them."    Matthew 26:39  "And he(Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed..."    It is very unfortunate that you insult us.    Edit:  @Christine M    We believe that Jesus Christ(pbuh) was the Messiah.|`|8tqciFXbaa	Islam is a Religion because it is the second most widely followed belief system in the world, so well within the mainstream of popular belief!|`|8pQrIL90aa	http://perfectlyhuman.multiply.com/video... see this and you will know why.

Allah demands submission, Jesus says decide.|`|gqhoCu3faa	THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

B7UIP9QYaa	Hate is the opposite of love and is strong feeling.  Don't forget everything you project will come right back at you. Jerks are anywhere and there is nothing you can do against that. The best is to forgive you to have fallen for him as he was not worth you and to forgive him for the pain / hurt he caused to you. Then just ignore him,  move on with your life. Don't waste time in petty feelings such as regret and hate. Close this door and look for the next door of happiness already open for you. Don't waste time on lost cases. Any minutes of unhappiness is a minute lost that you will never get back. It is not others or circumstances that makes you happy, it is yourself, so decide to be happy and look for that new someone who will rock your life and bring you the love you deserve.    Courage. Move on!|`|QYy0vU4maa	get away from him you may have to see him everyday but that does not mean you have to talk to him. You should not let him use you.|`|AA12158476	It's called "Ignore."

QWMPWia4aa	I kinda knew it all along but I guess it was when I was 16 and first kissed a boy that I knew for sure.  I'd already kissed a couple girls but that wasn't anything like when I kissed this boy I really liked and I felt tingles all through my body and stuck my tongue in his mouth and it was the biggest thrill of my life (up to then atleast!)    From that time on, I never looked back.  I was gay and I LOVED kissing boys!|`|zRAjpm0kaa	Well I was literally born gay because I remember even in grade 1 I was kissing boys but I really never thought anything of it as I got older say grade 7-8 I knew because I found myself developing crushes on guys not girls, they were more of a friendship crush. I never lied to myself because I never dated any girl but nobody asked the question, I am out of high-school now and I came out to a few of my friends and they had no idea, I never claimed to be bi or curious because I already knew this is who I am, and I love it ;).|`|aDXsUPYRaa	I kinda figure out that i am gay when i was like 9-11 yr old. and then up to the high school, when all the guys usually look at the bikini girl on the beach well i was looking at the different thing. so, things getting complicated when i fall in love with a guy i guess i wasn't ready for that and i start fighting it and it end up REAL BAD. and i've been a hard time to go through this... so i kinda claimed i was Bi when i was 17-18. right now...

So until the age of 16, I began to analyze some of the feelings I had.     It started with having a health class and finally learning about being homosexual and that it was normal. It was the first time I heard people use the word gay without an insult coming afterward or something negative.     I was in denial first but it took me about 6 months to accept myself with the help of my ex bf.|`|ox5GMwEEaa	I always have known since i was a child I was not like the other boys..I always had an attraction for boys and when i got older for guys soo it was always natural for me to be attracted to guys.. so i really think i was born this way..anyone can say that no one is born gay but i think its true...or i would not be in this position!|`|JwGS57jzaa	Im not gay?!|`|7e4076060b1fd97619bd53c99e4ca187aa	I always knew I had a unusual desire to men. It wasnt until I was an adult that I knew that it was an attraction. I tried dating women, slept with many to try to forget about men... but in the end,, it was men I was drawn to. So there was no gradual thing, or a realization. It was just as natural to me has having green eyes, it was the accepting part that was difficult.|`|QWzVFvQKaa	I had "feelings" about it when I was in middle school.  Then in high school they became more pronounced and I suspected that I may be gay but still never accepted it.  I had my first gay experience at about age 19 or 20 but still thought of myself as essentially straight.  It wasn't until about age 25 that I finally accepted it.

Q2aikWjUaa	Second Lateran Council held in 1139, when a rule was approved forbidding priests to marry. In 1563, the Council of Trent reaffirmed the tradition of celibacy.    Celibacy is Church Practice, Not Dogma  Matt. 19:11-12 - Jesus says celibacy is a gift from God and whoever can bear it should bear it. Jesus praises and recommends celibacy for full-time ministers in the Church. Because celibacy is a gift from God, those who criticize the Church's practice of celibacy are criticizing God and this wonderful gift He bestows on His chosen ones.    Matt. 19:29 - Jesus says that whoever gives up children for the sake of His name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life. Jesus praises celibacy when it is done for the sake of His kingdom.     Matt. 22:30 - Jesus explains that in heaven there are no marriages. To bring about Jesus' kingdom on earth, priests live the heavenly consecration to God by not taking a wife in marriage. This way, priests are able to focus exclusively on the spiritual family, and not have any additional pressures of the biological family (which is for the vocation of marriage). This also makes it easier for priests to be transferred to different parishes where they are most needed without having to worry about the impact of their transfer on wife and children.     1 Cor 7:1  Paul teaches that it is well for a man not to touch a woman. This is the choice that the Catholic priests of the Roman rite freely make.     1 Cor. 7:7 - Paul also acknowledges that celibacy is a gift from God and wishes that all were celibate like he is.     1 Cor. 7:27  Paul teaches men that they should not seek marriage. In Pauls opinion, marriage introduces worldly temptations that can interfere with ones relationship with God, specifically regarding those who will become full-time ministers in the Church.     1 Cor. 7:32-33, 38 - Paul recommends celibacy for full-time ministers in the Church so that they are able to focus entirely upon God and building up His kingdom. He who refrains from marriage will do better.     1 Tim. 3:2 - Paul instructs that bishops must be married only once. Many Protestants use this verse to prove that the Church's celibacy law is in error. But they are mistaken because this verse refers to bishops that were widowers. Paul is instructing that these widowers could not remarry. The verse also refers to those bishops who were currently married. They also could not remarry (in the Catholic Church's Eastern rite, priests are allowed to marry; celibacy is only a disciplinary rule for the clergy of the Roman rite). Therefore, this text has nothing to do with imposing a marriage requirement on becoming a bishop.     1 Tim. 4:3 - in this verse, Paul refers to deceitful doctrines that forbid marriage. Many non-Catholics also use this verse to impugn the Church's practice of celibacy. This is entirely misguided because the Catholic Church (unlike many Protestant churches) exalts marriage to a sacrament. In fact, marriage is elevated to a sacrament, but consecrated virginity is not. The Church declares marriage sacred, covenantal and lifegiving. Paul is referring to doctrines that forbid marriage and other goods when done outside the teaching of Christ and for a lessor good. Celibacy is an act of giving up one good (marriage and children) for a greater good (complete spiritual union with God).     1 Tim. 5:9-12 - Paul recommends that older widows take a pledge of celibacy. This was the beginning of women religious orders.     2 Tim. 2:3-4 - Paul instructs his bishop Timothy that no soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim his to satisfy the One who enlisted him. Paul is using an analogy to describe the role of the celibate priesthood in the Church.     Rev. 14:4 - unlike our sinful world of the flesh, in heaven, those consecrated to virginity are honored.     Isaiah 56:3-7 - the eunuchs who keep God's covenant will have a special place in the kingdom of heaven.     Jer. 16:1-4 - Jeremiah is told by God not to take a wife or have children.    By the way their are some married Priests in the Church today|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	Yeah.  Peter was the "rock" foundation of the church.  but he was married (can't have a mother-in-law without being married).  Hmmm.  Good question.    Perhaps it was modeling itself after Jesus.  Paul was single too.    I don't know...but as a protestant, one of the most encouraging things in a church is being ministered to by a husband/wife team.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	My mother, who is a devout catholic told me that priests used to be able to marry.   When they did, the church would give them a house and when the priests died, they were leaving their houses to their children instead of the church and that's why they don't allow them to marry any more.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	The discipline of priestly celibacy began in the twelth century to stop nepotism where Bishops were giving their bishoprics to their sons. However it is important to acknowledge that the Church has always honored the discipline of celibacy in the example of St. Paul, Jesus and others. It is also important to acknowledge that the Church has never forbid marriage among anyone and honors God's first command to go forth and multiply. The Church encourages marriage among everyone.    Also, only the Roman Rite of the Church out of the 23 Rites has the discipline of celibacy. Even the Roman Rite allows married priests under specific circumstances. God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph    NOTE:    Someone erroneously stated that priestly celibacy is a Tradition. It is not but simply a self-imposed discipline of the priest.|`|68EupsWtaa	Priestly celibacy originated in the 12th Century mostly due to the Church losing property or having to fight to keep property because priest's would leave their churches to their heirs.  Over time some theology and symbolism developed to justify its continuance (like that they are sacrificing marriage for the sake of their mission or that they are married to the Church), but being that it is a discipline and that it is not dogmatic it is liable to possibly change in the future.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	It came about some time in the early medieval times.  Then MEN could be bishops by appointment without being priests(Gregory of Tours Grandfather) after a bit it started to become a little bit dynastic(Gregory of Tours as example again) The church changed to priest only in high office with Celibacy as a tenet to keep church property, money and control in the hands of the church alone with no heirs looking for hereditary rights.  By the way most of the apostles were married and abandoned their wives and children. And Only the Roman Catholic priest are never permitted to marry. Russian Orthodox marry, Ukrainian Catholic can enter married but may not marry again once spouse dies.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Pope Gregory VII in 1074 was faced with a bankrupt church at war and the widespread problem of married priests taking the gifts of lands and wealth given to the parish for the church and passing it on to their own  children as an inheritance. he was trying to centralize authority in Rome over the dead bodies of local bishops, and he was pissed that the church was broke while local churchmen were wealthy and even their children with concubines had lands and wealth from donations Rome never got a part of, so he sent out a letter saying local bishops who married or allowed priests to be married should not be obeyed and married priests should not be paid. the First Lateran Council of 1123 would absolutely forbid priests, deacons, sub-deacons and monks to marry, but it didn't stop the practice and subsequent popes are known historically to have had concubines and children by them, like Pope Alexander VI, born the year Columbus discovered America, who left behind nine illegitimate children.    I note that the Apostle Paul calls forbidding to marry (1 Tim 4:3) a "doctrine of demons." and we see the results. Rampant pederasty in the priesthood as well as a priesthood that scarcely attracts anyone but closeted gay men who for the rest of their career will try to tell straight couples how to have a happy marriage which they themselves will never experience.

I'm sure it would be in the Trillions.    Looong Answer: Well, let's see..  They occupy some pretty prime real estate in Europe,  something they inherited from over a thousand years ago.. since none of it is for sale  = Priceless.  BUT if they were, they'd be in the billions.    They are ALSO the largest single denominational religion in the world, so that means they have building all over the world. -- Hard to put a price tag on that, but lets just guess they are worth Billions.     They are also the largest provider of health care, education, and charity in the WORLD,  so none of those buildings are up for sale, as it would mean cutting back on the services they provide to many 3rd world nations and the poor,  so rather then Billions, they are  "Priceless"    So all told..the property alone, if probably is a few trillion.     ::::: I'm starting to sound like a Credit Card Commercial :::::::    The Catholic church has been given some of the world's rarest and most prized artwork in the world. Something they keep on display to the general public.  They act as a storehouse for humanities art and expression of faith towards God,  so although these art treasures are probably worth Billions,  they aren't for sale.  If they WERE, then the entire WORLD would loose out on these art treasures as they would no doubt fall into the hands of private collectors.  Therefore, they are not for sale.  ergo they are,  you guessed it.... "Priceless"    The cars, and other 'everyday things" that the Catholic church uses to run its facilities are probably worth billions, as well...again, simply because it is a world wide religion which educates, clothes, and feeds the world.   If anything could be sold.. these 'everyday objects' are the most likely to be sold off, if anything.     The Vatican releases, each year, its fiscal budget.  It is a matter of public record if anyone wants to see it.  Usually, it hovers around 32million US dollars. Most of this money comes from museum fees.  The biggest COST to the Vatican is the EWTN TV Network.  The Vatican ALSO runs the world's busiest Pharmacy which is open to the public and gives everyone 20-60% discounts on perscriptions and medicine,  no tax of course. - So there is a cost involved to run that as well.     In GOOD years, the Vatican has a surplus of 3-6million US $$, but in bad years, they run a deficite like many nations and have to borrow from the Italian banks.     The Pope, Bishops, Cardinal,  ALL take vows of poverty. What they have beolongs to the Catholic Church itself. This partial explains how the church obtained its wealth.  Each Bishop or Cardinal takes a vow of poverty..in turn, anything given to them, because the property of the Catholic church.  Centuries ago, of course, Bishops and Cardinals were VERY closely aligned with Kings and Queens, therefore the wealth of that nation, often times partly became the wealth of the Catholic church.  However, this hasn't been the case for many hundreds of years.     Some local Catholic Churches also publish their annual budget in case anyone wants to review it. I know the budget of the Chicago Diocesses sometimes exceeds that of the Vatican itself. This is done to make the operation of the church as transparent as possible.     Catholics themselves, at least in the US,  give the least amount of money of any Christian denomination. Catholics don't believe in "tithing" so they don't give the church a certain percentage.  In many churches, people only give $1-10 dollars a week, in the collection plate. In my local parrish, most people give only $5.    So, IF you wanted to sell off everything, then it would likely be Several Trillion dollars,  however, since most of it is not for sale.. you could say it is "Priceless"     In either case,  the Catholic church can't sell off its holdings for several reasons. 1) What would it solve.  It would allow them to injec a large amount of money into the world's economy, but that would likely drive up costs of items.  At the very least it would be a temporary solution, as,  as soon as the money is used up,  poverty, famine, genocide, political corruption, etc.  would ALL return to normal.   2) The Vatican would be in a far weaker position, financially after it sold everything off. A Weaker Catholic church means it can't continue operations as normal. This would be a HUGE blow to the hundreds of small nations which the Catholic church helps out.  3) the huge influx of money into the economy might actually increase greed and corruption, especially in smaller African nations which already struggle with these issues.  4) The World would loose countless rare and precious art pieces and loose a huge piece of it historical record in the process.  Scholars would loose access to the Vatican's vaste archives of historical documents and artifacts. The sell off of those would be an unmeasurable blow to the academic community.    There is a general misconception that the Catholic church hordes money.  That it is greedy.  MAYBE this was the case in the middle ages, but it hasn't been the case for hundreds of years. The art it has is valuable because it is OLD. So it isn't accumulating art like it was. The Age of "expressing your faith thru art" is largely over.   Likewise, merely because the Catholic church has a large number of land holdings, doesn't mean it is rich.  It does collect rent for a few of these locations, but the VASTE majority are the land its churches, hospitals, and Schools sit on, so they can't sell the land or the buildings without closing down services.  Lastly, people don't realize that a financially healthy Church serves the world much better then a financially insolvent one. So part of its responsibility to the world is to keep itself financially solvent. - and t|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Probably fairly large but that is no business of atheists. I'm not Catholic.

JcwjDpY8aa	I never tip at these places.  Tips are expected in a restaurant atmosphere because the servers make about half of minimum wage, and the rest of their hourly wage is made up by tips they receive.  In places like subway and fast food, they make at LEAST minimum wage and they normally dont provide an "over the top, intangible experience" as a server might.  A server WORKS extra hard to make better money, subway employees and fast food employees simply do what is their basic job description and do not go over the top for the expectation of a tip.  They will do the bare minimum they can get away with and expect to be tipped for it.  Usually in places like this with a tip jar, the jar is removed when the owners come in because they are not approved.  Tips from tip jars only go to the person manning the jar- which is usually the person in the place with the least amount of duties.  I have witnessed tip jars being created and used simply out of boredom and lack of focus on their job duties.|`|2FNfyxVqaa	I guess you would tip for the friendly service... I do SOMETIMES but only if I felt that the person was really nice and they made me feel good..it's hard to come across nice people nowadays so when someone is nice it's good to show the appreciation.

I do not tip at Subway or Dunkin Donuts I think tipping has gotten way out of hand. I think they split the tips, but when you have to go into the place and get your food I do not see the need to tip, they are literally doing their jobs preparing your food and there is no service involved whatsoever.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	I never tip at fast food (i.e. subway, McDonald's) restaurants because they don't provide any service to you except passing the food over the counter for you to take it to the table yourself.  When you finish, you are expected to clean up and throw your stuff away.  If you need more drink, you have to go get it yourself. Hence there is no "service" provided.    In a cafeteria, they sometimes carry your food to your table.  They usually refill your drinks and clean off your table after you finish, so I do tip in those situations.|`|qq804CE8aa	Fast food places or places like SubWay - no I don't think tips are needed.  I don't tip if I call in a order some where and go and pick it up either.  However when you are in a cafeteria setting, you usually have a waiter/waitress come to your table offering you refills on drinks and all.  I usually leave a tip here.  Restaurants in general - yes.  Course there have been times with I felt like writing a note to the waiter/waitress...give better service and you would actually get a money tip.

I usually leave a dollar or two on the table.  They're trying to make a living too, but I don't worry about leaving a strict 15 or 20%.  I mean its not like they did THAT much.|`|r7wrTNWIaa	At these type of places and only if they have a tip jar, I leave a dollar (and the miscellaneous change that comes with it)  as a tip. Most food at these places cost about 5-7 dollars. 1 dollar for a 5 dollar meal is about 20% for a tip. It just seems to me that anything under a dollar (just change) is kind of cheap.    addendum: Having worked in a beer/wine pub, I can attest that tips ARE appreciated and remembered. Sometimes we did just serve and do our job, but it was always with the customer in mind.|`|9b190ff02866633a642ef79aa8cd2e5daa	I like to tip and I almost always tip quite well, partly because it just makes me feel good to do it but the few times I've tipped at a fast food place was my saying "keep the change" and I only did it as a way to flirt with the counter girl :)    There's no social convention to do so here in the U.S.|`|YSuc7L8taa	I leave a couple of bucks for the clean up person who makes several trips to your table to pick up plates.
hBBQZ6yDaa	yes, they change last name, when they get married, but the middle name stays the same, because it's her father's first name, when after marriage only a woman's father's last name changes, and she takes only her husband's last name, for example:  Say a woman's name is Olga Orlova, her father's name is Pavel Orlov, so her full name would be   Orlova(last name) Olga(first name) Pavlovna(middle name)  when she gets married to say....   Hohlov(last name) Alexander(first name) Petrovich(middle name) - obviously his father's name would be Petr Hohlov  then Alexander's wife would be   Hohlova Olga Pavlovna, instead of   Orlova Olga Pavlovna    she changes her last name, and takes the last/family name of her husband, because he's her closest family now, but her middle name/father's name doesn't change, she's still a daughter of Pavel, so she'll still be Olga Pavlovna.
jwT20biwaa	First congratulations to those who raised you and your BF. Secondly congratulations to you and your BF for showing respect for Seniors by offering them your seats on the bus.    As a senior myself who periodically has physical limitations that makes it difficult to stand in a moving vehicle I graciously accept the kindness of a stranger when offered a seat. Being offered a priority seat is something that doesn't happen frequently enough.    Your former friend showed a lack of respect and manners. The aftermath of the situation by severing the friendship is his lost not yours.|`|AA11791312	I'll just bet your "friend" is much younger than you, am I right? Or at the very least, a LOT more immature. Because his attitude is so reflective of most young gay men these days. Not only could they give a rat's a$$ about older GLBT people, but probably about older people in general, which unfortunately is how a lot of this generation thinks of their elders, regardless of sexual background on either side of the issue.    I think he got it backwards - YOU and your BF certainly don't need friends like HIM.  I take Metro and the buses here in DC, and if an older or handicapped person needs that priority seat and I'm in it, I will get up and move or allow them to have it.  It's kind of amusing, though, when some older people actually seem INSULTED when they're offered that front seat. But that's for another question entirely.    But you and your other half keep on being true to yourselves. It's a sign that you were raised properly. Unlike OTHER people.|`|r6fGmJK1aa	What you and your BF did was a very nice and gentlemanly thing to do.  This friend was not raised with manners.

If he cuts off your friendship because you are caring and helpful, it's definitely his loss, and simply shows how incredibly insensitive and selfish he is.

I would have done the same thing. Maybe he felt like a doosh for not thinking of it first and it made him feel bad that he wasn't raised as well. Maybe there is something else going on. Maybe he is angry that you are together and he doesn't have someone he relates to in life. Maybe he felt like you were ignoring him and he got jealous.    If he is angry that you respect your elders, tough. He needs to grow up, get over it, and get a life. He's going to have a hard time in life because the world doesn't always work the way that a spoiled brat wants it to work.    If he doesn't want frieds who respect their elders, I would let him know that you respect your elders over having selfish friends and that you are sorry it isn't going to work out. You don't have to change for him, no one ever promised anyone a rose garden in life. Not everything is going to go his way. I would recommend that you just find new friends who understand life more on your level.    If he wants to make up, tell him that you will continue to be chivalrous in the future and that you won't change that and you hope that it won't bother him in the future, but you are not going to change that and that he needs to be respectful of other people's customs and ideas (he is not always right about everything).    Let him know that everyone has their own way of doing things. You can give you chair but he doesn't have to, and you respect his way of doing things and that he should respect yours ...

(Here is the way we/my son believes it) Before we are born our soul is an angel that picks out where it wants to be born. When a person dies the soul becomes an angel again and goes back to heaven.    The question is harder than you think, it all depends on your belief and I am sure people have different opinions on it.

You should also know that highly politicized organizations on hot topics such as abortion may not actually look so hot on your college transcripts.

The last thing in the world they want is a young person, especially a girl, to choose to be prolife.  This weakens their position and causes them to cringe.  Just your posting alone is doing something.  You have renounced the killing of innocent and helpless children and announced respect for life at every stage of development.  Let your voice be heard.  The voices of profilers are the only voice these poor victimized children have.  They are certainly not given a choice, are they?  If you wish to help in other ways, there are several good prolife organizations out there designed to help women and their babies. For example:  Your local crisis pregnancy center helps mothers who respect the lives of their children but don't have the support system they need to handle a pregnancy alone.  Also, groups such as Human Life International, American Life League, and National Right to Life are looking for volunteers.  Every January 22nd the March for Life includes 100's of thousands of prolife marchers in Washington DC to protest Roe vs. Wade.  Perhaps you can attend some year when you are older.  Or even now, if your parents will allow you. Many churches and other groups from around the country send bus loads of people to the March.  I live near DC and have attended it many times.  It is encouraging to see so many people standing up for what is right.  Eventually, I believe we will win, because killing children is wrong and the other side knows it.  Sooner or later, truth will win out.   Since you are a minor, talk with your parents and tell them what you think.  Ask them to allow you to pursue your position by volunteering.  If they are truly pro-choice  they should respect your choice to be prolife.   The best thing you can do now is speak up.  Don't let those who fear your message silence you.  They have already silenced 1.5 million unborn children each year for the last 36 years.  Enough is enough!

Crane's Blue Book of Social Stationery (2002) uses this for its examples (pages 89, 108, 110, 111, 112).  "The woman's name appears first" appears on 112, 113, among countless others.   Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior (2005) states on page 603, "That gentlemen appear first in the traditional designation of a married couple, Mr and Mrs, should not be allowed to go to their heads.

The days when the husband's name had to go first are, thankfully, long past.

Do you want a big sissy who sits in a chair and plays video games all day long?  No!  Heck no!  You want a man!  A real man will propose to you.    Don't ever take a man's job away from him. I'm tired of passive crybaby boys. Make him do the work he was intended to do.

a6JZjRG1aa	people who wrote that Japanese is easier are liars...  Chinese is easier, more interesting and of course more beneficial...|`|OsH2JR9oaa	Neither is harder than the other. Japanese grammar is difficult to understand especially someone who grew up with English as a native language. It's the complete opposite of English in terms of subject, verb etc...    Chinese has almost no grammar at all, but they have a lot of kanji and saying the same word in different tones/dialects can mean several different words.    I'm studying Japanese right now and it's a lot of fun, especially with my native teachers. But before I started, I was like you, except I was also considering Korean. I eventually based the decision off of where I would rather live out of the three, and I chose Japan as it has the closest in relation to culture to the United States, where I live.    The Japanese also have a lot of loan words from English which makes things a bit easier in some cases. You can figure out a lot of their borrowed terms just by sounding them out loud. (I.E. Basu, Biru, koohi, amerika, supein, osutoraria - these are some really basic ones)|`|j3ntYzssaa	If you don't want to be challenged much I prefer learning the Japanese language.  I already took 3 Japanese classes and there 6 in total.  It was a little hard for me so I didn't continue it..  You have to memorize the Hiragana and Katakana alphabet.  That part is easy..    Hiragana table example:   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...    Then there's the Kanji which are really Chinese letters.  Those are more difficult to memorize and there are wayyy to many of them.  Like thousands and thousands!!  The Chinese language is harder to learn but if you want to take up the challenge that's your choice.  :)|`|bWNsTFjEaa	I've studied both Japanese and Chinese a bit.  I have much more confidence in my ability to be understood in Japanese due to the similarity of vowel sounds with Spanish.  Except for the Kanji, written Japanese can at least be deciphered phonetically.  That being said, Chinese grammar does not require gender and conjugations.  It IS possible for native speakers of English to become fluent in either language.  Either could be useful in business.  Consider, however, the difference in numbers of the respective populations.|`|n2cYgs6faa	hi there,  I recommend you this course to learn Chinese easy.    http://www.consumer-expert.com/learn_chi...    regards,

4b21006f14999f52b2e85e092542486baa	For Catholics, Easter is not just Easter Sunday. It includes the whole week before, called Holy Week, and several weeks afterwards. It commemorates the last and most important events in the life of Jesus Christ.    Holy week starts with Palm Sunday ( the Sunday before Easter) which commemorates Christ arriving in Jerusalem and being welcomed by the people. On the Thursday (Holy Thursday) we remember the Last Supper with a service which usually includes a "foot washing " ceremony.    On Good Friday there is a solemn service in remembrance of Christ dying on the Cross. It usually includes a reading of the story of Christ's death on the cross - the Passion. It is a day of fasting.    On the Saturday night, traditionally near midnight but these days often a bit earlier, there is the greatest service of the church year - the Easter Vigil - in Catholic churches a Mass. This includes readings from the OT, Psalms and the telling of the gospel story of the Resurrection. Lots of singing, renewal of baptismal promises etc. etc. (There are those who have a party afterwards and stay up till dawn, but they're a bit mad).    On Easter Sunday itself there is usually a very early service, the Mass (or Communions) of Easter Dawn in which the finding of the empty tomb features.    Most Catholics will go to one or the other - the keen ones might do both. Most people will then have a good family meal together, exchange Easter eggs etc. etc. In more Catholic countries, there are often processions, plays and other celebratory events but, due to the reformation and puritan influence, these are not common in the USA or UK.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	The long answer has it pretty much wrapped up and with a bow.  The fasting on the Friday of Holy Week is pretty rough, but it's all part of the history and celebration of our faith.  My family specifically has something like this on Easter Sunday, we go to Mass in the morning and then usually have a great barbecue or party with the family and do all the normal things like egg hunts, food, and being with the family.|`|MSORDfOKaa	Easter is the oldest and the most important Christian Festival, the celebration of the death and coming to life again of Jesus Christ. For Christians, the dawn of Easter Sunday with its message of new life is the high point of the Christian year.  Easter is the story of Jesus' last days in Jerusalem before his death.The Easter story includes Maundy Thursday (the Last supper leading to the Eucharist), Good Friday (the day on which Jesus was crucified) and Easter Day (the day on which Jesus came back to life).|`|jxhBk2cyaa	catholics do the same thing as christians they believe the same dat jesus died|`|RP6dDFTsaa	so we don't go to hell. like all catholics we do what we want to do on the week days and when it comes to the holly days we go to church and pray our butts off.|`|eR14nyPRaa	For everything you need to know about Easter please visit http://www.squidoo.com/everything-about-...|`|taYDaBH5aa	The long answer is really good. I'm just going to tell you what I personally do as a Catholic on Easter, and I'm representing myself and most of my Catholic friends. I go to Catholic school, have since kindergarten and I'm a junior now.     All through Lent, we don't eat meat on Fridays or on Ash Wednesday. Good Friday is the "sad day". We go to mass and it's a really solemn service and everything. We usually go to Stations of the Cross a couple of times too. We go to Mass on Sunday morning and procede as usually with dinner, easter egg hunts, etc.     If you are researching Lent as well then there's a heck of a lot more that you need to know. In that case, I'd look it up. Try the Catholic Encycolopedia website.     :-) Ellen

Anyway, the one who gets more noise from regular people when presented on stage is elected.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	This question would be better suited to cultures or travel or holidays, as royalty are not elected.

If not contact legal services to become an emancipated minor due to abuse. So sorry to hear about your mom, kudos to you to get out of there and try to make it on your own. Education is going to be your best avenue to a better life, so be sure to check into that for scholarships and such. You can speak to your local college counselor for that even if you don't have a high school diploma, most have classes for that too. Good luck on you life journey.

QlMubgPcaa	I've asked myself several time how I would react if my son were to ever tell me he is gay. The only answer I have been able to come up with that makes sense is would be to hug him, tell him I love him and always will and ask when I get to meet his B/F if he has one yet.    Any thing else would be hypocritical. I raised him to accept others for who they are. If he is gay I truly believe he was born that way and has no say in who he loves. Rather then a future daughter in law I would have a son in law.|`|AfVSH3ghaa	OK you relay cant do anything because he is who he is and you cant change that and you cant ignore him he is your son and he loves you so you should love him back because if you don't love him he could ignore you a lot|`|OsxQNDHzaa	Just love and accept him for who and what he is.  It's no choice and he ain"t gonna change.  But he still needs your love.    Sorry, that's the best advice I have for ya!!  :@)|`|HAHDipTAaa	If he was dying of a serious illness you would be entitled to be shocked and upset. If he is healthy and happy with himself - you should be happy for him because he has been brought up in a family where he feels he can be true to himself and to his parents - celebrate you have a good son.|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Congratulations.   Once your shock wears off I hope your homophobia and discrimination wears off too.

Try and want for their happiness.  Imagine if your son were, say retarded, or became brain injured, and couldn't communicate.  That would A LOT worse than him being gay.  I just hope he uses protection when having sex.|`|hyxmP95Eaa	If you really love him then accept him for who he is.  there is nothing you can do to change him, and i'm pretty sure that he doesn't want to be changed.  by coming out to you he is showing that he wants a strong and open relationship with you.  the worst thing you could do is reject him.  he is feeling a lot of mixed emotions and by rejecting him you could really hurt him.  i'm sad to say that i personally know many gays who had come out to their parents only to be pushed away.  now they don't even talk or communicate in anyway.  he is reaching out to you.  he wants you to be in his life.  embrace him and accept him for who he is.      if you need help there is a wonderful site that will guide you in this new relationship with your son:  www.pflag.org     or    www.familypride.org|`|ROVhLgH7aa	would you rather he was a criminal?|`|wdiRbJjpaa	this guy is a human analysis teacher. any question he may ask is bologna.

4SF4KGu4aa	When I was young and my dad had a rural mail route, we got the real deal direct from the farm. It had chunks of butter in it and much better than the cultured stuff we get now. Course it also blocks the arteries much faster.    Didn't like it when real young but I love the stuff now. Just don't think you can get the "real" thing anymore. We just had it at home and doubt that it cost anything since customers used to be able to give the mailman some gifts but you'd get fired if you took one now.    I have no problem drinking a quart of it and likely could do a half gallon even of the new stuff.|`|hallarIxaa	When I was a kid working on the milk route with my dad it was nine cents a quart home delivered.

OxnyOaxGaa	*  Hi, Happy Birthday, gosh I can smell that cake too, chocolate icing also..?    I myself have had a lot of difficulty trying to explain the fear of God, I know most say it is an awe, reverence. But when you have come so close to God, there is a trembling sort of fear, not always, sometimes, just because you have felt, known, experience the Power and Greatness of God Himself.  So just recently, last week I believe, I began to search the web for studies on the fear of God and I came across this one and it explains it to a T.....especially the fact that their are different types of fear concerning God. I think it may have to do with where we are in our walk with Him, God knows us all very well, what we need, what we can handle, what we are ready for, hence the differences....this is my thoughts still pondering...... :)     Here is the link, I hope it may help.  http://www.atruechurch.info/fearofgod.ht...|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Happy Birthday!    You are going to get a lot of answers saying fear is reverential trust, or something like that.  And this is certainly true.  But there are also places where the text warns us to be afraid of God.  The text also tells us that perfect love banishes fear.  Those who love God completely have no reason to fear Him.  But God is a realist.  He knows that both a carrot and a stick are necessary in order to protect the life of His creation.  The admonitions in the Law not to exploit the poor or oppress the powerless are followed up by a warning to fear God.  The message is clear:  they may not be able to protect themselves, but God will.  The Creator is the best of all possible friends.  He is also a terrible and implacable foe to His enemies.  It is reasonable and healthy to fear His displeasure.  This isn't politically correct.  I know that.  We operate on the utterly unfounded presumption of innate human goodness despite the overwhelming evidence against it.  God knows that evil cannot be restrained through love and reason alone.  It must also at times be opposed by force.  He's made it His job to be the ultimate enforcer of justice in the universe.  God can be a scary guy.  It's not a good idea to make Him mad at you.  Hope this helps.    peace|`|AA10014750	Fear to me presently is very close to respect.  Further,to use a priority system analogy; Him 1, self(mankind; part of the creation) 2.    P.S. Happy Birthday!!|`|2K2QyLJCaa	There is holy fear and unholy fear.    Holy fear is having respect for a power that is greater than ourselves.    Unholy fear is an unholy power that governs our mind, keeping us from performing the things we desire.    So there is holy fear, associated with the holy spirit, and there is  unholy fear, associated with the flesh (and I'm not talking about our physical flesh).|`|0sEspN5baa	fear in the english bible translates directly to:    awesome worship, reverence, praise    I've given up on the 'why' of it getting so distorted,  but God knows 'the plan' not I, so I just dig in  and discover the amazing secret of the Word of  God, it speaks on many levels and is dimensional  and 'alive' when one allows oneself to scratch below  the surface....    adversarial thought creates fear and confusion,  and God is not the author of confusion.    I can confuse myself within 30 seconds of arising in the  morning - so, it's not God's doing, all this confusion,  it's error thought (sin = missing the mark in Greek,  and misunderstanding or error thinking in Hebrew).    People have been manipulating the Word of God  for centuries for their own personal agendas, and  it saddens me heartily to see masses of people  who are unwittingly and willingly allowing themselves  to become what I call a 'fear based' believer.  That,  to me, is what causes all the dissension within Christianity.    I follow Jesus, my Savior, my WayShower, my Brother, and I wish there was a different label for me,  rather than lump me in with the fear based believers...    and when I used fear in that previous sentence, I was  using the dictionary definition, NOT the Scriptural  translation of AWESOME REVERENCE, PRAISE, WORSHIP.    An yeah, I tremble at the awesome Omnipotence of God,  but not out of fear just out of grasping the edge of the garment  of the hugeness of God, the vastness, the eternalness,  the whatever it is that is bigger than my mind can graspness.    I luxuriate in the unknowing of God because I have a very  intimate and TRUSTED relationship with God through Christ.  And further the Scriptures tell us:  For God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love  and of a sound mind.    Don't go by appearances - and words are appearances,  dig beneath and find the Truth --  it sings out crystal clear.    OMG   HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO  YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR FRACTAL HAPPY BIRTHDAY  TO YOU - here we go, once more round in the cycle of gravity....    and chocolate cake at 4:30 am is communion with God, don't you think????    thanks for this really necessary Q :)

Take a lantern, candles or whatever you may have available and have an evening dinner picnic outdoors. I know that my husband would love to do something like that.

That is a minimum since you have to get there and back $25 if they come to you..    I use to teach English in Japan and if you can get enough spots per week you can make good money.    If you can find comic strips in Italian, they are very good for teaching kids along with songs.  I also had flash cards with pics on one side and the words on the other.  Then you can make games like find the card that is Amarillo(yellow?) and whoever grabs it first adds it to their stack.

M3sVQm2Maa	You've been reading too much Tim LaHaye.   So threats of hell aren't quite working to force people to believe, huh?   You have to try another scare tactic to try and make people believe (or pretend to believe) in your religion?  Wars, famines, floods, and earthquake have been happening since time immemorial.  Generation after generation of people who bought into the "last days" baloney have died wondering why their last days weren't THE last days.|`|H7L66ynJaa	We are living in the last days but when it will happen only God the Father knows but we are to watch and pray.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2Peter 3:3-9"First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Sure. People have been saying such foolishness for 2,000 years.

Those who regard a freedom from the chains of either religion  or the false moralities of sex as debauched are doing naught   but corrupting their minds with foolishness.

To become a psychologist you would need to earn a college degree and probably pursue advanced degrees in psychology.  If you are wanting to work with transsexual clients, it would probably be a good idea to take LGBT studies courses.  There are not a ton of schools with formal LGBT studies programs, but the numbers are growing.  If you can't take that, then take as many diversity related classes as you can and become involved in organizations that work with transsexual people.

Foreign food was considered icky.  Everyone drank MGD, and no bartender knew how to make a martini.  All of the single women were of a horrible tooth to tattoo ratio.  Oh it was awful!    Oh, and there were only three radio stations.  A country station, Christian rock station, and a bubble gum rock station.  Worse yet, the bubble gum rock station was so close to my home that the songs played through my surround sound system (even if it was off) and came through the VCR if I ever played a VHS tape.

Hence the saying, They shall go into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. The torment of disappointment in the mind of man is as exquisite as a lake burning with fire and brimstone. I say, so is the torment of man.     Hence, the ungodly suffer a prolonged and insistent self-reproach; the painful sting of conscience wraps them in intense mental suffering; a poignant uneasiness is born of their sense of personal guilt. Remorse of conscience results from the violation of divine law.     As Alma taught, the wicked shall be "brought before the tribunal of God" with their "souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all" their "guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all" their "wickedness, yea, a remembrance that" they "have set at defiance the commandments of God."    he great misery of departed spirits in the world of spirits, where they go after death, is to know that they come short of the glory that others enjoy and that they might have enjoyed themselves, and they are their own accusers. "But," says one, "I believe in one universal heaven and hell, where all go, and are all alike, and equally miserable or equally happy.    You might say, "I believe in one universal heaven and hell, where all go, and are all alike, and equally miserable or equally happy." What! where all are huddled together-the honorable, virtuous, and murderers, and whoremongers-when it is written that they shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body? But St. Paul informs us of three glories and three heavens. He knew a man that was caught up to the third heaven. Now, if the doctrine of the sectarian world, that there is but one heaven, is true, Paul, what do you tell that lie for, and say there are three? Jesus said unto His disciples, "There are many mansions in my Father's kingdom (house): if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, and I will come and receive you to myself, that where I am ye may be also."|`|zQyslfHKaa	Its like driving in the lincoln tunnel getting to the end and suddenly realizing you are entering New Jersey.

a0YeSoBEaa	here are a few stories that have happened to me and my family;  1 this happened before i was born but was recounted to me by my father.  my mother was expecting twins but miscarried them both,my father phoned the doctor to see what he could do and the doctor told him get your wife to hospital.my father also asked the doctor what to do with the two miscarried phoetuses and the doctor said nothing can be done with them throw them on the fire[we grew up in a house with a coal fire]  my father told him he wouldnt do that and instead he wrapped them in a small blue cloth and buried them under the family apple tree.  the same night my father was up late reading[which is something he did on regular basis.when he was interrupted by the sound of two pairs of childrens feet running through the house followed by the words daddy,daddy,daddy.  2. when i was about 7 years old my grandfather died and two weeks after there was a violent thunderstorm and it was in the early hours and still dark.i was asleep but was awoken by a large crash of thunder and when i opened my eyes i saw the brilliant white outline of a man stood in the middle of the room.he spoke one word in a booming voice HOME and vanished.i told my mother the next morning who told me it was probably my grandfather because when he was alive he liked the family house and always regarded it as home even though he didnt live with us.  3when i was about 9 years old i was watching tv with the rest of my family and myself ,my oldest sister and my youngest brother were all sitting on the sofa,the light was out and the room was lit up by the light from the tv screen when all of a sudden a black object ran over my feet,the feet of my oldest sister and the feet of my youngest brother,it moved very quickly and felt like a small animal like a cat.you can imagine we all lifted our feet up very rapidly all in unison  4 when my mother died in hospital i was alone in the house as the rest of my family were being informed of my mothers death.i was sat in the living room with the light off and the kitchen light was on and lit up part of the living room and the light of the kitchen cast a shadow on the wall,this shadow was the exact silhouette of my mother right down to her permed hair.i was alone for roughly 20 minutes the shadow never moved and after a while my younger brother came home he walked into the living room where i was sitting and said to me and these were his exact words"what the f  k is that and pointed to the shadow on the wall.i just told him i think its mum but i didnt mention it just in case you thought i was mad  all the stories i have told you above are true,i swear my life on them and when people say they dont believe in ghosts there is nothing that they can say that will ever convince me that they dont exist|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Ghosts certainly exist.

Of course to those that believe that they do not exist, were all crazy and insane. For a believer no proof is necessary, for a skeptic no proof is possible, I believe they fear the unknown and to each their own, but yes they do exist and yes I have heard them and seen them!!|`|e3gZsCsgaa	I see parts of their clothing but I convince myself that it's just my imagination. After all, I'm gifted with an imagination that could overlap into reality if it isn't tamed. Yes, I saw a little lost boy's ghost run through a wall near my dorm bathroom in college. After that, I never lived on campus or went near that bathroom again.|`|qcflj3umaa	I have not seen a ghost in person. But I saw one in a photograph my Aunt took. My family has also had some ghost experiences. My Aunts work as the cooks at a bed-and-breakfast/restaurant that was built in 1832, as a plantation. Some time between 1840 and 1875 a fire burnt down the third floor killing 3 children and a servant. The picture I mentioned had 3 orbs, and a smoky figure in it. There was also lightning going perfectly around my uncles eyes, nose, and face. This really creeped me out, but that wasn't the first or the last paranormal event to occur. My cousin who stayed there heard a piano playing at night. There were no other guests other than her family and my 2 Aunts, and they made sure they were all upstairs, the doors were also locked. My Aunt has also heard a child yelling "Daddy! Daddy!", and seen human shadows move in empty rooms. And the 75 year old employee who has worked there for at least 30 years, and would never lie, has told me that numerous guests have reported hearing children playing in the attic, which is the third floor, where the children died.|`|AA12148328	This is just one of a couple of ghost I have seen .. I was upstairs in my home in the bathroom cleaning . I looked up towards the hall way and  a man came out of the master bedroom across the hall and down the stairs . I was alone in the house .He was tall about 6ft or better , wore a blue plaid shirt and blue jeans .  The lady who had owned the house told me that I described her husband , he didn't die in the house but had died after they sold the house .|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Yes, I have - for real.  A few even.  A couple of examples? *  Transparent woman caught in a wedding photo taken by the photographer I work for - she wasn't there when the picture was taken, and we did the developing of the film ourselves so we know the photo wasn't tampered with or "photo shopped".  *  A man and a woman who regularly walk by the window at my friend's house and then disappear.  Upon research of the property, I found out there was a husband & wife murder-suicide on the property and I believe that caused a residual haunt (an energy imprint, like a video stuck on a loop that just keeps playing over and over.)      Other people have seen things I haven't, but that doesn't mean I don't believe they exist.  For instance, I've never been to Scotland, my Dad's ancestral land.  So if I stick to "seeing is believing" - then I should be skeptical that Scotland exists?  Because I have not personally seen it?  But others I know have taken a trip there and told me of it.    Ghosts aren't here for your amusement.  Some are simply residual energy imprinted on a place, usually where a traumatic event happened. (Residual haunts do not interact with the living - the "ghosts" you see in one aren't aware you are even there.)     Others are spirits that have chosen to remain earthboud for whatever reason - unfinished businesss, unwillingness to leave loved ones behind, fear of what awaits their spirit on the "other side", etc.      Adults also tend to have shut down their extrasensory perception as they grew up - and this makes it more difficult for one to be able to "see beyond the ordinary".  If you work to open your mind's eye, you're intuitive senses - you may have a better chance of seeing a ghost the next time you are around one.

But you can't put it like the way you did, because of the following reason:  'etwas' requires either a noun (example: Hast du noch etwas Eiscreme - Do you have some Ice Cream, yet) or a verb in the 'zu' form, which is probably what you want:    Hast du noch etwas zu erledigen - Do you have something to manage, yet?|`|6k3mwKthaa	What exactly do you want to say?

swkhohjgaa	Although my therapist had offered letters I have never needed one. I have been to two different doctors and both gave me my meds so i have to believe the doctors approval is all you need.     That said I think going and having therapy is a wise choice.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	I'm very shocked. Usually you have to go through months of therapy with a diagnosis of GID. There are in fact a LOT of health risks with going on T.    The other issue is if you eventually want top surgery you might not be able to get it without a letter from a therapist.|`|LOSfacl5aa	All you need to take T is a doctors prescription. I take my estrogen from my family physician and he never required a therapists letter.    The standards of care do require that you get a therapists letter, but there is no law requiring a doctor to follow the standards.|`|65QqZBnjaa	Yes:    http://www.DrBecky.com/therapists.html    After an evaluation the therapist may write you a letter of referral to an endocrinologist.  The endo will evaluate your health, prescribe the T,  monitor your progress and do regular labwork.    A good online support group for you is:    http://www.Susans.org Click "Forums", then "Transsexual Talk" and the FtM section is right on top.    Other links:    http://www.TheTransitionalMale.com    http://www.FtMguide.org    http://www.Transster.com      Good Luck!        edit: Just read the rest of your question.  Woah, who gave you the script for T?  Well that's unusual, but NOT illegal.  As long as you have a prescription it is LEGAL.    According to the Standards of Care therapy is NOT an absolute requirement.  Download the SOC here:    http://www.WPATH.org      edit: From page 11 of the SOC:    "Psychotherapy is Not an Absolute Requirement for Triadic Therapy. Not every adult gender patient requires psychotherapy in order to proceed with hormone therapy, the real-life experience, hormones, or surgery. Individual programs vary to the extent that they perceive a need for psychotherapy. When the mental health professional's initial assessment leads to a recommendation for psychotherapy, the clinician should specify the goals of treatment, and estimate its frequency and duration. There is no required minimum number of psychotherapy sessions prior to hormone therapy, the real-life experience, or surgery, for three reasons: 1) patients differ widely in their abilities to attain similar goals in a specified time; 2) a minimum number of sessions tends to be construed as a hurdle, which discourages the genuine opportunity for personal growth; 3) the mental health professional can be an important support to the patient throughout all phases of gender transition. Individual programs may set eligibility criteria to some minimum number of sessions or months of psychotherapy. "|`|aWPmvPpfaa	i'm pretty sure you need three months of therapy according to most of the "rules" most doctors go by. that being said the hbs standards are guidelines and not laws. the doctor that gave you "T" without counseling may be a quack. anyway why not go to some counseling, it did me a world of good.|`|YDykVkcmaa	It sounds as if your Dad is trying to just freak you out. There is no legal requirement for therapy - that is not to say it's not a good idea. I think it probably is.    Also it is not illegal to have testosterone. It is illegal to sell it without a prescription but that is not the same as you having testosterone for personal use.    The cheapest source, by far, is injectable testosterone. The next cheapest is AndroMen Forte t-cream that can be imported from Australia. This is a bio-identical hormone and, like any bio-identical hormone, is very safe.|`|3OZgcntfaa	Well, you should have a diagnosis period to get to a doctor who is properly acquainted with transitions... but counseling and therapy isn't actually a mandatory deal.    I was 19 when I walked into my first diagnosis session, and four visits later I had a confirmation that I am a transman and was set up with an appointment to see the doctor who would be doing my endo.    People are amazed at how fast I got through to the prescription stage as well, but I didn't do anything illegal or dangerous. I went through the proper channels and was pretty lucky to be dealing with well trained people who aren't gatekeepers.    If you have a competent doctor, you aren't at risk like people who get testosterone illegally. My parents were scared about my health too, but a sit down with some doctors (real professionals, not people with opinions) assured them that I wasn't in danger.    If you're going to have the money in two weeks, don't stress it. If it's an ongoing issue, ask your doctor to sit down and assure your parents that you are in good hands.
swkhohjgaa	I have to ask this question. Im not implying that you are. Im just asking in the interest of knowledge.     Younger adults are often still rebelling against their parents by doing the exact opposite of what they want.      Is it possible that you are now putting your parents in this position to get back at them somehow?       Your 25 years old. Didn't you know how your parents would react? You know what your parents are like uptight, rich, white folk. And yet your tastes seam to be the exact opposite? Its curious thats all.  Possible food for thought.    If your feelings are real then I believe you should follow your heart|`|N73oZyY8aa	Nothing. Face it, your family is miserable. They don't like the race bit. What a bunch of BS.

If you truly love him then you should talk to your parents, if they don't listen then oh well. I mean your 25, you don't always need your parent's approval. You've got to start living your life without your parents approval.|`|LOSfacl5aa	Just ignore your family. If you are happy in your relationship that is all that matters    My family does not approve of what they call my "lifestyle choice" even after 23 years|`|OuMhera8aa	Well, obviously you're old enough to take care of yourself. They can't tell you who to love and who to not love. If he's the one for you, he's the one for you. Tell your parents to please at least try to accept it, if they can;t then they'll lose you.|`|drxspOUwaa	Nothing. Prejudices run so deep. Scripture says," When I was a child, I spake as a child. When I became a man, I put away childish things." Now you have to believe what you believe without falling back on the folks. It's hard, I know.|`|5iiQnjE2aa	That's terribly unfortunate. i'd wage they probably think your new beau is being opportunistic to get at your lifestyle. of course, that's based on really bad stereotypes but unfortunately some people are like that. maybe the best way is to get your family to meet him and know him for the great guy you see him as. and in the process maybe they'll dump some of their negative ideas.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	They are incredible snobs and you don't need their approval.|`|aWPmvPpfaa	so they're racists and not homaphobes. you're 25, who cares?|`|B7UIP9QYaa	It is your life and nobody can live it for you. So you should decide what you want for it. The reaction of your parents is protective they are afraid that possible the ethnic difference and economical ones will become an issue when the first months of passion will be over and the relationship will have to face the challenges of the daily routines. Possibly they also fear that your companion may be with you because of your social / economical status. At this time there is nothing you can do to change their opinion, actually it is more how your relationship will evolve that will possibly produce the change and acceptation. In this case your partner will also have hard time as he will feel rejected and undesired, but if he opposes to these patience, love and intelligence, he will soon be accepted.     Actually you two must understand the concern of your parents and from there on decide the best attitude to adopt.     Courage!|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	You can't force them to approve of him. If he's the person that you want to spend your life with than be with him. The racial matter isn't a good reason to not date him. I would be concern about the income but just because he come from a poor background does not mean that he has to remain poor or can't end up earning a reasonable amount of money. As long as he treats you right. You could end up with some rich jerk who take you for everything.     I think you need to focus on your relationship and see how things go with the two of you. It may or may not work but you shouldn't dump him because of the petty reasons that your family stated.
TyRfv0eoaa	That's a tricky one. I would rephrase the sentence. Maybe something like this: The words two, to and too are all pronounced the same in English.

AA11849917	I think that's a fantastic commercial.  What does that say about NBC?|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Maybe it was not objectionable, but maybe the Super Bowl did not want hypocrisy involved in advertising.  Obama is for life,and the baby in the womb, then why in the world would he be so pro-choice, or should I say pro-abortion, with the bills that he is signing and wants to sign.  I guess he was thankful for his mother's choice!!|`|JqHkgWROaa	The fact that it's Obama's makes it objectionable.    Why on earth would they put a pro-vegetarian commercial up? How stupid. If they do that, then they better put up some pro-carnivore commercials.|`|9d24eebc65f160389e6cd993dc745cd8aa	Well, of course I see something objectionable. I don't think it's necessarily *inappropriate*, but it sends sort of a silly message. That we shouldn't allow abortion because the baby you abort might, against all odds, be great.    Isn't it just as valid to say that the baby might grow up to be a mass murderer? In fact, isn't that scenario more likely by a factor of about a hundred?    Edit: I'm not saying ANYTHING about a father leaving, or a mother struggling. I'm saying that, in general, it is a spurious argument against abortion that the person might be great, because the person might just as easily be horrible. I'm not talking about black or white, rich or poor. I'm saying that If talking about potential greatness is fair game, then talking about potential monstrosity is just as fair. Sure you might abort the next Marin Luther King, Jr. You also might abort the next Stalin. That's how it works.|`|WalnRzfGaa	thats not an ad for Obama. its an add for Anti Abortion/ Anti-Choice.    they used Obama as a reason not to get an abortion.    it was rejected because its to much of a political/religious based ad to be aired during the superbowl.|`|AA11297267	Gee, it wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that the video of a fetus in a womb *isn't* Obama?  So that the commercial is obviously a complete sham?  "This child will grow up to be..."  But it's NOT "that child."  They might have had it approved if they'd changed the text to say, "a child like this" or something similar, but as-is it's deceptive and a flat-out lie.    By the way, the "potentiality" argument is incredibly weak.  Some have already explained why.      You know, I could make a similar commercial that would be just as valid:  This child will be born to a good family.  He will not live in poverty.  He will be a very religious child.  He will get good schooling and support.  He will be a decorated war hero in WW I.  ...  Then he will brutally murder millions and begin the bloodiest and most lethal conflict in the history of the world.  This child is Adolf Hitler.    Peace.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I don't see anything wrong with the ad.    But they probably felt a political ad wasn't so appropriate during the Superbowl.     Not saying I agree, but that's probably why.|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	it is a religious , pro life campaign  it uses a " what if " situation  it is disgusting and I dont want my children being brainwashed while watching  superbowl|`|yoKHoKXjaa	I think it is giving people false information.  Here is the bottom line: If I do not want to have a child, you cannot force me to. Its my body and If you want the baby so bad, you can carry it in your body them push it out of your body.     If Catholics would actually EDUCATE their children on Sex properly, abortion would not be such a big deal.|`|AA10096992	I will NOT get RickRolled again.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	I don't really know what to make of the ad but the PETA commercial was sleazy as hell.  Woman getting off on veggies.  It was inappropriate in my opinion.
4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	It really depends in what way.  If I was put in the middle of a jungle and told to survive with others, I would hope that those others had survival skills, as I have none - that would make them superior to me in that situation.    If we were then put in a house when we arrived back on 'human planet' and we were told we had a brick house but with no amenities and we had to sort out our own, then I would be great in that department being a project manager.    I guess we are all equal, but we all shine differently.    :)|`|YkseyT7zaa	Yes and yes|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes I do consider all human's equal.|`|mlAI5S5Eaa	i consider everybody as an equal. because it doesn't matter their color,their race,or their beliefs.  to me everyone is an equal. everyone in the world has ups,downs,good days,bad days. we all live on the same planet.so why should any of us think that we are different from the next person? we all eat,drink,sleep,and sh*t the same. so no other person is better then any one else. we are all equals.|`|Wch2WybQaa	Absolutely not.  Only those who said yet to the first question.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Why hypocrites? I consider all humans equal. I might sometimes make a mistake in speech or writing that makes me seem racist, but if I see a Romanian, American, Lithuanian, Iranian, Israeli or Chinese person (to mention a few, lol) I will treat them like I'd treat any other person...    Though I do find it weird to say "race"... aren't we all the human race?|`|bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	Yes everyone is equal but some people aren't treated equally like they deserve and yes I think we are all hypocrites I'll admit it I'm a hypocrite!|`|FCNAf6NTaa	I believe in equal rights, but not equal abilities.    If you and I were to race, only one of us would win.  But both of us should be protected from illegal search and seizure.|`|1906a9ce6fee04c71556573ddf5f3e0baa	Of course not.  If we all had equal abilities in everything I might, but I know there are those who are superior to me in some thing and I'm sure there are those who I'm superior to in others.  I don't think there can every be total equality because of this.  Sure there is a sort of conceptual equality in knowing that my husband has complimentary abilities to my own, but that's not equal, it's complimentary.  I think until we start recognizing this fact instead of trying to say "everyone is equal" we're only hurting those from whom we expect more or less than they can give.|`|drxspOUwaa	You might not understand or relate to another's race, beliefs, or whatever and still rush to save them in an accident or hold them in a tragedy. That's equal.

QnH9QuQwaa	When I was as an Atheist I just shrugged off prayers.    Why anyone would get offended is beyond me.    But you make a good point.  I could see why they would get worried. But I'd be more worried about my health than anything.  I'd interrupt her and say "Um, can I talk to the doctor please?"    Maybe even "Nurse, isn't there something else you could be doing to comfort me before I go?"|`|AA12346187	d  defiantly|`|HG5Smxkjaa	I am not scared of atheists at all...They will NEVER be able to take God away.....    I choose D)  A nurse at my bed, telling me it will all be fine, because with the doctors you're in safe hands.....    I know I will be in safe hands...because God will guide the hands of the doctors....I don't care if the nurse believes this or not....I do!|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Neither would bother me.  By the way I understand she violated the patients rights but  I know many nurses who pray unobtrusively for their patients and the patients never know. I wonder why she was not discreet.|`|QwKiK85eaa	I'm an atheist and I don't care if people believe in god I respect others choice to believe in god. and d|`|ulwXFrrJaa	If they think we can take away God from everything, I wonder if that means they think we are more powerful than God.|`|WbaN6osZaa	A nurse at my bed praying with me to Jesus that I don't get the Atheist or Muslim 'doctor'.|`|AA10096992	If I may...     E.  "Don't worry if the surgery goes wrong. Heaven awaits."  F. "I really hope you make it, because you aren't saved, and you're definitely going to hell if you die."|`|4fTiCNiKaa	None. I believe you left out the obvious letter "E"...    E) A nurse at my bed telling me she has asked the Lord to help me have a speedy recovery, and that everything will be alright.    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival|`|b0IYXTcBaa	Any of those would be fine really. It would not make me uncomfortable in the least because I know the truth and the truth has set me free. Did the nurse praying for the patient unasked step over a line, I would say yes. If she had asked before hand it would have been a different story, if she had asked before hand, was told no and did it privately later it would have been a different story. She crossed a line and deserved to be reprimanded for it.|`|RVAPQg6Waa	E) A nurse at my bedside having a discussion with me about informal logical fallacies, false dichotomy in particular....|`|DB9QbZoQaa	No, you can not take my faith away.    If in fact you deny God, as a person that has nothing else but science to rely upon, I would you rather consider psychonuroimmunology or perhaps the placebo effect. Than ask the question again.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	A. I would appreciate her efforts and understand that she was doing what she thought was right. But I'd probably giggle while she did it.  B. Obviously not, because I'd assume that the voodoo doll was a representation of me.  C. I'd respectfully ask her to keep her opinion to herself.  D. Obviously, this is the most professional thing to do and the thing that I would be most comfortable with.    It goes without saying that any of the nurses in scenarios A-C could be seriously reprimanded if the patient wished to complain. You only pray with or for patients when they ask. Otherwise you are treading on dangerous ground.|`|6794f93a2c25215efb9c04ff8be60496aa	A true christian would know that NOBODY can take God away.   If they are secure in their relationship with God, they will know that.|`|VHrLpbjQaa	definitely the voodoo doll... jk lol  Atheists dont have the power to take my God away... No matter what they think...Catholics such as myself are definitely not afraid of anything athiests are doing.. God is stronger than any ATHIEST!!!!!!!!!|`|l31Vj8w5aa	D!!!!  I'm a Christian with a different point of view concerning religion, but I don't believe in pushing my beliefs down other people's throats.  I've had several Atheist friends and I never felt the need to "save" them.  Religion is a personal choice.  Prayer does not belong anywhere but at home and at church.|`|3YzXWHwbaa	My answer for you is that you don't have to believe in God, he believes in you.  It may be trite and over used, but it is still true so is applicable.    The nurse should have been praying silently enough that no one knew what she was doing.  When you do spiritual things with the intent to call attention to it, it is not always a good thing.  God hears silent prayers as well or better than the puffed up annoyingly loud ones (not saying that is what she was doing, I haven't read or heard the story)    Btw I have no beef with atheists----|`|nCpfa6MFaa	Do you know, it just might be A with me. For this reason. You like to be in the hands of someone who actually cares. I had my first baby in a hospital, and oddly enough, the uncaringness stayed with me for longer than all the many mistakes they made, including having my stitches done with the wrong thread and the MRSA that I got.|`|349974840c2ddf946cda1b9160ff2645aa	Why should you be bothered by what others do to you, what you should be worried about is your state of sanctity, if you're going in for an operation you better be in good standing with GOD. I'll pray for you, and I,m not even a nurse.    Jesus : I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes unto the Father, but by me.    Shema Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	E. A nurse at my bed taking my vital signs and getting me prepared for surgery. I will have family and friends at my bedside praying before surgery. If the nurse wants to hold our hands and pray with us then he/she is more than welcome.|`|7559b813a98c150ef5b45122ecdbef0aaa	None of the above, thanks.   I have been a nurse for 25 years and have  prayed for patients but I don't do it without their permission.|`|99xBLoLcaa	E) All of the above!    (shudders at the knowledge that this is actually possible in most hospitals)|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	I've taken 8 Christians' god away, that I can remember.     I would have taken away more gods than that, but most Christians run away in terror before I can finish talking to them.    They talk a big game until you corner them, and then, yes... they are scared to death of us.
5vqo3XzHaa	Plain and simple - his remarks are hypocritical!  Bottom line - He is using this statement to justify his passive attitude toward fighting terrorism.  And you're right, if he truly believed what he was saying, he wouldn't be in favor of a woman's choice to have an abortion and have it paid for with federal funds, taxpayers money.  He can't have it both ways, he's either for protecting innocent lives, or he isn't, and he's either for aggressively fighting terrorism, or he isn't.    God bless you!!!|`|oojO4WAraa	I don't think life begins at conception.  If you believe that, do you think BC pills should be outlawed?  Because they prevent the fertilized egg (what you claim is a life) from implanting.      I think Obama will be a good president.      You also need to get the facts straight on what the bill he signed really meant.  While it paid for abortions, it also pays for maternal and child health care, birth control, STD treatment and many other things women in third world countries need.  This bill doesn't pay for all abortions.|`|AA12346187	he may  believe  that  but still accept  women's right of  choice|`|AA11297267	An undifferentiated bunch of cells (an embryo) is not a human being.

A human being is a biological entity that is seperate from any other and is capable of living on its own.  An undeveloped embryo does not fit that definition.    As for his comment -- he's right.

Any other opinion is just that of some religions, not a science fact.|`|macZI2dzaa	I guess he doesn't care about the least of these.  Genie-  fetus is a generic word like adolescent or adult.  One must include the species if one is going to be accurate.  The fetus in the womb of a human is a human fetus.  The only things that human being needs to survive are what you need, a safe environment and nourishment.

opTNhj00aa	Does he have a favorite sports team?? If so, you could dress up in that attire, paint your face in their colors, take a crazy pic of yourself (cheering, etc), and frame it. On the frame, write something like: I'm your biggest fan! And then promise him you'll watch at least a few games with him. Or if you can afford it, get him tickets for a game.     Not a sports guy? Movie guy? Photoshop. Find pictures of Movie posters from his favorite movies and photoshop the actors faces out and put your faces in. Do this on two or three--this is good for a card or a framing gift (again with the pic frames). Tag line: Here's to my leading man OR ...something cheezier.    Lastly--beer. What's his favorite kind? Buy a six-pack. The card should say something like: when I'm too much to handle, when you think you can't stand it anymore, "if she snorts like that ONE more time", have a beer.

Everyone lives their lives day to day, mostly unaffected by what they read and see, as long as it doesn't affect them. It's only when something happens in your life that you adapt and learn new experiences, whether good or bad.  Your friends haven't seen what you've seen, they're still in the 'happy bubble' they were in before you left and only when they mature and experience the harshness of life will their views change. Until that happens you and they will distance in friendship.    We all have past friends we've out grown, those that after a while bore us and we no longer have a connection with., this is just all part of life and growing up.

It always does. But maybe you just don't fit there? I know I don't fit here... maybe you belong in wharever country you just left.     But definitely don't stop being a nice guy, that's for certain. Hopefully there are more of you type of guys, I'd love to meet one! But yeah, maybe you should go back to where you belong?

I've had similar observations when traveling.    Your time there was a growth experience, your development as a person has moved forward. Indeed it is difficult to return and see others in such a rut, but don't lower yourself just to fit in.  They will probably ridicule you for it, but just ignore their taunts, broaden your horizons, and move forward.|`|aoa4jCjdaa	you know i fink the same as you.    i know how others are still stuck wanting an "american lifestyle"    wen its not real.    i fink you need to change the people who you hang wiv.    your experience of living in a thrid world country has changed you for a reason. made you a better person    its still good to get pissed but not with people who get banged up.
42DjF8Ckaa	No, in my opinion it is rather greatness to be so kind and forgiving to the person who has just done you wrong. Gandhi had lived in this greatness and he also recommended this way of living for everyone else. Not only Gandhi, Jesus and so many others said the same. We should love the ones who give us pain and behave in all kinds of evil because when we love our heart becomes pure and the person that we are loving, his or her heart is also touched by love and is made the same pure as the one who is giving the love. The receiver of love finds the same kind and amount of purity as the giver. That is why it is so important and vital to love the ones who don't seem to be quite nice and good with you and give you pain, because only through loving can you change that evil into good and hate into love by purifying their hearts with your love.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	At times I believe it is a weakness not to dare strike who is hurting you. Defending yourself, that is. I don't think I am one to insult and criticize more than one, at most twice before receiving a deserved earful. Why tolerate abuse, after abuse and do nothing.  I have often seen a question here at yahoo, which is completely innocent of offense to anyone, or by its' own nature and yet allowed are people who in return may answer viciously and maliciously, and vindictively! And yet if you respond in kind you, the questioner, will be accused of ranting, showing your natural resentment at the abuser. But You must bite your tongue and keep your silence while the abuser gets away with venom in his/her blood, INTACT!!! ready to attack someone else, plus report you as well.  I doubt TOTALLY that being fair.  In actuality, the abuser who strikes one with insults and obnoxiously given criticism may not be so able to get away with wrong doing. You do the Math about THAT kind of unfairness. I've given up.|`|DlL98tVHaa	no, it is wisdom.|`|N9WzNLsRaa	Well, it depends on how you look at it. It can be considered a weakness or a strength.

This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord.  and no it  is not a weakness to turn the other cheek or take criticism.

It is hard been a Christian, because people takes advantage of you , walk all over you, has they do a door-mat.........Jesus teaches his disciples an active nonviolent approach. He bridles the wild impulse for violence even further. "But, I say to you..." Jesus calls us to go beyond the law of equal retribution with the statement "Do not resist evil." What does Jesus mean by these words. But, the idea of not resisting evil may fall strangely upon our ears. It raises many questions for us. What does Jesus mean by not resisting evil? Does he mean that we are to let evil have its way without a fight? Does nonresistance mean that a battered wife is just to "turn the other cheek" and allow her husband to beat her senseless? Surely, Jesus didn't mean that. Are we to be the world's laughing-stack, passively allowing the violent and the mean-spirited to walk all over us without the slight bit of resistance? Is the way of peace that Christ is advocating a form of passive non-resistance, that is, humbly doing nothing in response to the abuse, oppression, injustices, and violence that is dished out to us and others within the world?     This passive approach to peace appears to have been the general understanding of non-resistance among Christians for centuries. ." The nonresistance peace approach meant resisting no evil, using no force, being defenseless in the presence of violence, suffering wrong rather than retaliating in violence, and bearing no arms. non resistant stance was to be the "quiet in the land"  But, it was  passive nonresistance That Jesus was teaching his disciples in the Sermon on the Mount.We to as Christians should always turn the other cheek, and just ignore evil in all of is form|`|RDrjBLGjaa	It depends on what kind of criticism it is.|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	To me i would be a lot stronger for turning the other cheek.|`|AKDfOoxCaa	I wonder if the advise of Jesus contained in the above words is meant in the literal sense at all..

vEEeq7kYaa	For the Catholic church that never excommunicated Hitler or other prominent Nazi Catholics, this current action by the Pope has definitely eroded the goodwill the previous Pope encouraged between Catholics and Jews. Below I will post portions of an article from The Times Online:    This is not so much an act of grace as a surrender, the veteran Vatican watcher Marco Politi said. Benedict wanted a new era of reconciliation, but the new era has begun with a lie. The Pope has made a openly declared and unshakeable anti-Semite a legitimate Bishop.     Lefebvre, who died in 1991, had set up a fanatical and reactionary counter-Church which openly contested, repudiated and defamed all the crucial points of Vatican II, from respect for the Jews to modernisation of the liturgy. There are an estimated 500 Lefebvrist bishops and 600,000 followers worldwide.     Gianni Gennari, a theologian and contributor to the Italian Catholic daily Avvenire, said it was shameful that the lifting of the excommunications was not accompanied by any repentance whatever on the part of the Lefebvrists.     Bishop Williamson, who has said that the Vatican is controlled by Satan and that the Jews are bent on world domination, reiterated in a broadcast last week on Swedish television that the historical evidence was hugely against six million having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler. I believe there were no gas chambers.     He added: I think that 200,000 to 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps, but none of them by gas chambers.     Prosecutors in Regensburg in Germany, where the interview took place  and where the Pope once studied and taught  have opened an inquiry. Holocaust denial is an offence under German law.     Father Federico Lombardi, the papal spokesman, insisted the lifting of the excommunications had absolutely nothing to do with Williamsons views on the Holocaust. One is not connected to the other, he said. Vatican Radio said Williamsons statements had been condemned by other members of the St Pius X fraternity.   ---------------------------  Note, there has been no apology for his views, which include being an outspoken 9/11 conspiracy theorist who claims that the world trade center collapsed because of bombs set off internally, not because of a terrorist attack.    If the excommunication was "redemptive" where is the retraction of the very beliefs and positions that the offending bishop voiced? If there has been no repentance how is this of redemptive value?  -------------------------------  Now, here from the transcript of National Public Radio ..this explains in greater detail the Church's supposed reasons for making them legtimiate bishops once again  The four bishops' split with the church arose from a conflict that began with the Second Vatican Council in the mid-1960s, which, Allen says, "had the effect of sort of dragging the Catholic Church kicking and screaming into the modern age."    "In reaction to that, a number of camps grew up in the church that had different opinions about the way things were going, but only one of them went into formal schism  that is, you had a group of bishops, priests and rank-and-file Catholics who sort of lock, stock and barrel cut their ties with Rome and set up, in effect, a parallel church," Allen says.    These traditionalists grouped around French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and came to be known as the Lefebvrites. Williamson and the other three bishops were the four men that Lefebvre ordained to carry on his work, Allen says.    "The Vatican fears schism like almost nothing else," Allen explains, "because you have legitimate bishops who are able to ordain other legitimate bishops and, in effect, kind of reproduce the schism. Over the centuries, popes have moved heaven and earth ... to heal these wounds in the body of the church."    Even though the pope's decision has been portrayed as bringing peace to the church, "a lot of even moderate and even some conservative Catholics would look at this as symbolic of a kind of course change in Catholicism."    --------------------------------------...  So this says that RATHER than place these radical views OUTSIDE the Church where they belong, the church has now given them legitimacy.   Yes, this has indeed put Jewish and Catholic relations with regard to the Pope and the Vatican back decades. I am thankful that there are many Catholics who also see this as an egregiously offensive move on the part of the Pope.    "Lefebvre, who died in 1991, had set up a fanatical and reactionary counter-Church which openly contested, repudiated and defamed all the crucial points of Vatican II"    So, now the Bishops that Lefebvre ordained have full Vatican approval to continue the legacy that they called a 'schism" in the first place.    What this speaks to the world is that the Pope has effectively sanctioned the antisemitism of SSPX! For Jews and many Catholics it NOT merely over ordination issues and a schism, but over what this action has told to the world the Church represents.   I thank GOD* (edit to add, and of COURSE those Catholicis) that there are Catholics of integrity who are not antisemitic and who are also speaking out on this!   Please refer to the article I will link to below from "The National Catholic Weekly"  If you read ANY of the links below, please read the one from the Catholic Weekly first. And then I strongly suggest the bottom link from the Anti Defamation League to learn precisely why bringing this group back within the Catholic Church that STILL teaches antisemitic canards is why this act by the Pope is such a very bad thing, indeed.    edit: THIS excerpt from a comment left at the Catholic Weekly site by a poster named Jeff, speaks to |`|eUXe2wtWaa	The catholic church is a cult and misinterprets the teachings of Christ and the Bible. The pope puts himself as the next in line to God after Jesus and thinks he has the God given right to forgive sins.  There were more killings in the name of the church than killed in WW 2 and there was never an apology for their wrongs committed against mankind. Pope Nazi probably believes the holocaust is retribution for the Jews killing Christ .|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Because he was a leader in the Hitler Youth?|`|JqHkgWROaa	What I read was that they had to recant their claims before they were allowed back.    I could be wrong though.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Unity but it was only one who denied and he was reprimanded.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	These bishops were not excommunicated for their views on such events, and they were not reinstated because of them. While I regret that Williamson or any Holocaust denier would have a platform, it's only fair to point that out and yes, the Pope does say he has to recant that belief.     And the Pope was not a Nazi leader; that also is blown way out of proportion.     This is one of those issues that manages to bring out both Catholic haters and Holocaust deniers, and the truth needs to be spoken.    Add--I appreciate what John added about the Pope. He was a little kid at the time, and it's not fair to paint him as an adult Nazi leader.     Having said that I also appreciate what Mama Pajama has posted about the "sect" (for lack of a better word) that these bishops came from. While unity should be sought in the body of Christ whenever possible, it should not be at the cost of even *seeming* to endorse, overlook, minimize or apologize for something as despicable as Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism.     I only hope that the millions of devout Catholics of good will continue to be on their guard against this type of thinking and keep the church from going back to a dark and deadly time and instead keep the attitude of respect toward the Jewish people exemplified by the last Pope. For the sake of all humanity, the Holocaust cannot be denied, or it is sure to be repeated.|`|47sALOGfaa	The Pope is a Nazi.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Because cardinal Rottweiler was in the Hitler youth himself, and the Catholic church had nothing against Der Fuhrer until he started loosing!|`|AA10067344	Excommunication is tantamount to condemning someone to hell.  Lifting an excommunication and giving a "welcome back" are different things.|`|ohKKJAi4aa	The way I understand this particular Pope is that he was there, in Germany during the holocaust, and there is a rumor that he was one of Hitler's youth that were being trained and groomed to take over the world.  He knows better and this denial might be part of his agenda.|`|B6r56Nr7aa	One of them denied the Holocaust.     Also, they seperated from the Catholic Church and the pope is the type of Christian who wants unity in Christ's Church. That's why he welcomed them back.     If you're asking what he thinks about, then read this article in which the Vatican has ordered this bishop to recant his statements:  http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090204/ts_n...    The pope DEMANDS that that ONE out of the four bishops recant. The other three BELIEVE in the Holocaust.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Because the media isn't portraying the REAL details and don't understand the culture of the Catholic church.     1) The Bishops were not excommunicated because of their views on he holocaust in the first place.  They were excommunicated over doctrinal issues.     2) The Catholic church does not have doctrine on historical events..their is no reason to.  They are historical, they stand on their own. Anotherwards,  historical events like the holocaust and WWII are not religious. ergo, their views on history, were not the reason for the excommunication    3) Only 1 of the 4 holds this view,  not ALL 4, like the media portrays it.    4) The Pope can not withhold lifting the excommunication of the Bishops IF they agree to uphold the doctrine of the Catholic faith. Anotehrwards, he can't NOT forgive them if they ask for it and resolve the issue that got them excommunicated in the 1st place. -- This would violate Canon Law.     5) The Pope can't reinstate 3 of the 4, but withhold reinstatement on the 4th guy for reasons which don't pertain to the issue. -- That would violate Canon Law and be unjust    6) The Pope released a statement to the world saying that the 1 bishops views are regrettable and that the holocaust did happen and we can't deny the facts. The Pope ALSO addressed the Jewish Leadership.     7) The 1 Bishop released an apology to the Pope that his statements caused the Pontif such problems over his rash statements.  The Bishop didn't recant, but the did apology that it caused the Catholic faith problems.     8) Even though the 1 Bishop is reinstated, that does not mean he will be given a leadership role,  He is simply a Catholic again, and can serve as a Bishop,  hopefully in a non-public role, like an administrative role, where he can't voice his views.     9) That 1 Bishop doesn't COMPLETELY deny the holocaust.. only part of it,  but the media makes it out to be that he doesn't believe it happened at all, by labeling him a "holocaust denier"  - He doesn't deny the entire holocaust.. just the NUMBER of jews and the Gas Chambers.  -- I know that isn't much better..but it shows how the media blows things up, larger then they are.    SO...the events happened 20 years ago over religious doctrinal issues.  The Pope had no choice but to forgive them, as the concept of "forgiveness" is a HUGE principle in Christianity.  The Pope COULDN'T withhold this forgiveness and reinstating once they recanted their heretical views and formally asked to be reinstated.     People don't get that because they don't properly understand what Excommunication is about and how Canon Law works.  They judge Catholicism within the framework of the society in which the Catholic church happens to be in.  However, people forget that the Catholic church has a distinct culture of its own. AND operates in just about every country in the world, so it is unfairly judged by multiple criteria at once.  Lastly, peopel forget that the Vatican is a sovereign nation, onto itself, separate from any other nation in the world and has its own seat on the United Nations.    YES, the current Pope was a former Nazi Youth, BUT this background has been thoroughly investigated and he didn't partake in anything. He simply did that to protect his family from attack.  I find it regrettable that he didn't stand up and have more courage, but he was like 12 I think, so he went with the flow. His past has been thoroughly researched and it shows that the HELD OUT as long as he could before being pressured into the Nazi Youth.  This just makes him HUMAN,  and not perfect.  He allowed himself to be pressured into an organization he didn't believe was right. - That doesn't make him an evil person.  I'm sure MOST of us have been pressured into doing something in our past.|`|AA11440601	To the best of my knowledge, these "bishops" were excommunicated for being ordained as bishops without the Pope's permission which is against both Church Tradition and Church Law.    It is well within the Pope's rights to reconcile with these men if that is what he wishes. Let's hope that these men will lead the SSPX into rightful Church Tradition.    The lifting of the excommunication does make make them legitimate bishops nor does it mean that the Church agrees with their personal opinions. It only means that they can attend Mass and receive the sacraments.    Remember the purpose of excommunication is the correction and redemption of the person who has chosen to separate himself or herself from the Church.

The Pope says he didn't know about the denial of that particular bishop.    He was rescinding their excommunication for another reason, to reconcile with a rebellious faction within the Church.    No, it is not the Pope's view on the holocaust. But he has been rightly critisized for reinstating this despicable priest nevertheless.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	At the end of his weekly audience, the pope discussed his trips to the former concentration camp at Auschwitz and the images of "the heinous slaughter of millions of Jews, the innocent victims of a blind racial and religious hatred."    He said he hopes the memory of the Holocaust "induces humanity to reflect on the unpredictability of evil when it conquers the heart of man. The Shoah (Holocaust) be for all a warning against oblivion, against denial or reductionism, because the violence done against one human being is violence done against all."|`|WChr31Otaa	The pope has reversed their excommunication, meaning they are not seens as heretics to the church. The pope calls the 'liars' because he himself does believe the holocaust happened.  He states 'While they are liars, they are not heretics, that is why I welcome them back to my church.'  He is a man of law and there is no reason to keep those men out of the church if they have not offended the written word of the bible. I hope this helps.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	Because he is NOT very bright.  Almost since his first moments as Pope, Benedict has put his 'Prada-clad' foot in his mouth.  He has alientated the entire Muslim world by claiming Islam is an 'evil' religion.  He has alienated the entire gay and lesbian world with his life -long rabid homophobia. And the excuses made for his foot-in-mouth disease has always been "he didn't know'..or "The Holy Father was unaware.."  In one 'swell poop' he has dragged the Roman Catholic Church BACK to the Dark Ages.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	man, everytime you think the Catholic Church is doing right, they do something totally wrong.|`|AA11521494	Only one of them denied it.  He has been instructed to retract.|`|8I9uduIiaa	One bishop denied the Holocaust; another publicly stated that Hurricane Katrina was 'punishment' because there are gay people in New Orleans.    Both of these bishops are clearly fruitcakes. I think the Pope reinstated them because he thought he would get away with it, and he underestimated the public outcry that resulted.    By reinstating them, the Pope legitimised their views. I hope they've now had to recant.    And just to clarify what some people have stated: it is not a question of some people 'believing' in the Holocaust. The Holocaust was an objective event. If some people, with agendas of their own, choose to DENY reality, then that is their problem. But to speak of 'belief' in the Holocaust is not accurate.    For anyone wanting more info on the Holocaust: http://www.nizkor.com        GOOD QUESTION :)|`|FhHklqkhaa	he's a stupid bigoted idiot  I can't understand why he does what he does|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Well, the Pope is from Germany, and maybe he wants to silence this controversy by piously putting a lid on it... Personally, I am too busy trying to find out what Dick and George are trying to silence... But anyone who would deny the Holocaust, would probably deny 911; just like the Aggie truck driver who ran over a MIrage when he didn't realize it was a real car.
FCNAf6NTaa	There are lots of illegal drugs, only some of which are smoked.  My guess is you're asking about Marijuana, or pot.    It has a very sweet, spicy smell, completely different from tobacco.  You should be aware that clove cigarettes, which are legal, also smell quite strongly, so make sure you know what a clove smells like if you're not sure.    You run absolutely zero risk by walking by them.  You won't get high, you won't test positive for drugs, and you won't suffer any ill effects.  But if it bothers you it might be a good idea to walk elsewhere.      I wouldn't report them.  What they're doing is their business, even if it's illegal, which you don't know for sure.  If they wrestle you to the ground and force you to smoke pot you should definitely turn them in, but otherwise you should really just mind your business and let them do whatever it is they're doing.    Knowing nothing about drugs can be very harmful.  You should educate yourself about these things, and this forum is probably not the best place to do it.  People will tell you that marijuana is addictive, or can kill you - when you find out that neither is true you might decide to give something much more dangerous a try, working on the assumption that everything you've been told is not true.  This is a bad idea and probably how many people end up dabbling in dangerous stuff like heroin or coke.  Better to know the truth and make up your own mind than decide based on lies designed to scare you.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	take another route home?

Heaven would be hell to an irreligious man. We know how unhappy we are apt to feel at present, when alone in the midst of strangers, or of men of different tastes and habits from ourselves. How miserable, for example, would it be to have to live in a foreign land, among a people whose faces we never saw before, and whose language we could not learn. And this is but a faint illustration of the loneliness of a man of earthly dispositions and tastes, thrust into the society of saints and angels. How forlorn would he wander through the courts of heaven! He would find no one like himself; he would see in every direction the marks of God's holiness, and these would make him shudder. He would feel himself always in His presence. He could no longer turn his thoughts another way, as he does now, when conscience reproaches him. He would know that the Eternal Eye was ever upon him; and that Eye of holiness, which is joy and life to holy creatures, would seem to him an Eye of wrath and punishment. God cannot change His nature. Holy He must ever be. But while He is holy, no unholy soul can be happy in heaven.|`|QwKiK85eaa	There is no hell|`|RC1r1tsHaa	Only the "Salvation Army" to shop at    hehe, get it|`|ulwXFrrJaa	If all the girls are wearing clothing in heaven, i don't want to go.|`|HG5Smxkjaa	You needn't worry about clothes....you are an atheist...you will not be going to heaven with the beliefs your currently have....|`|AA11987172	Nope, the only stores will be Walmart & K-mart.

If I am wrong, I pray that the Lord gives me the grace to stand in the hour of trial.    1Co 13:12  (ESV) For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.

A decorative book on a shelf, a door stop, the basis for Christian faith and practice. We all get to choose to use it for what we want.    Particularly in the US, a lot of people have used it to found a new cult, called the 'End Times' cult. It's commercially very successful. There are books, films.  You can find loads of websites about it, and there are 'churches' where they teach all about it. A lof ot it is very political (the earth gets saved a lot, in their fiction, by white professional Americans) and some of it is plain racist. Much of it extols violence. There are very slight points of contacts between the beliefs of some members of this cult, and those of more traditional Christians ... the idea that you can get saved by gunning down Moslems with an M16 is only one of these ... and some even give a nod to traditional Protestant doctrines such as salvation through grace by faith alone, the atonement, and the authority of scripture, but this is only surface stuff, window dressing. The real cult focuses on hate, dissension, and of course, those big bucks from book sales and films.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	You lost me there after the word Christians, have no clue what the rest means...and I am a Christian, maybe I am missing something...|`|macZI2dzaa	Some are mid-tribbers too.

SSnB2dADaa	Well, if the woman becomes a Zombie then no, the baby would not be born, seeing as the mothers vital organs and the such cease to function, thereby not allowing her to give birth.    But if the woman is bitten but doesn't change immediately, depending on where she was bitten and how long its been, then (and this depends on how far along she is in the pregnancy) then the child could very well be born as a "Zombie Baby". The blood and nutrients still flows through the mother, and into the umbilical cord of the baby, so its very possible.    But with the added stress of a zombie apocalypse and being bitten, more than likely the mother just might inadvertently abort the baby or have a miscarriage.|`|SvJC6TP0aa	If you are talking about Sims 2I do not know.

KfG4cv6Yaa	Good point, I hadn't noticed that one before.    It seems that God so enjoyed killing all those boys, the only way to stop him was by slaughtering something else - a lamb to spread the blood on the door posts.  Could God (or his 'angel of death') really not tell Israelite from Egyptian, or believer from non-believer?  What about those who didn't have any lambs to kill?  No, God just loves the killing.|`|AA11946554	Yup. That FICTIONAL character is a monster in disguise.  To all the Christian, what can I say? You're all seriously deluded. To the few who said that's not in the Bible...yes, it is. To dewcoons who said b/c the Pharaoh had hardened his heart four times previously, who cares? According to that myth, a god should find some other way to 'punish' him. Especially one that supposedly knew what was going on the whole time (being all-knowing). Besides, why should 'commoners' be held responsible? If your child dies b/c of 'W', are you going to praise God?  It's a shame our president feels the need to say he's Christian. I don't know if he is or not-I'm just glad he's not acting (irrationally) on it.|`|88adf0621d46a4d78324d57cbb47b1ceaa	wow yet another great example of free will.|`|AA10096992	True, but to be fair to god, nothing is more fun that murdering lots of babies.|`|X6ESkvsqaa	When Non Righteous People hear words from God it makes them mad.  Like you're about to do and give me a thumbs down.      Pharaoh's heart is no different than yours in that when the Lord proclaims his soon return, Your also get mad and harden your heart too.    God Lives!|`|zIrE013maa	clearly you havent read a Bible. The Bible makes it clear that if a person would kill a lamb and spread its blood on the door post of ones house that the families first born would be saved. the first born, not the baby. the death angle would only kill the first born if the family didnt spread the blood. A lamb was used at the time for a sacrifice for ones sin. Pharaohs heart was hardened because God was going to show his people and the world the things he could do if you believe and trust in him.|`|XsHkWdf7aa	Indeed it is a good thing he is not real. More importantly than God wanting to kill all those people.. at least for me, is the fact that "God" goes against his word to not infringe on Free Will, by hardening the Pharaoh's heart... so not only is he a Murderer, he is also a liar and cheat. Why anyone would worship such a monster is beyond me.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	The Old Testament god was a vain, jealous and egotistical murderer...plain and simple.  HE hardened Pharaoh's heart so that HE would be able to show off, with a few hokey tricks (all of which are explained naturally) and get a few: "Wow"s from the Egyptians.   Anyone who can read the multiple claims that "I hardened the heart of Pharaoh" and still claim Pharaoh hardened his OWN heart really needs psychiatric counseling...ASAP!    The  frightening part is how CHRISTIANS applaud this monsters slaughtering of children, infants, and even unborn fetuses!!!!  Imagine what it would be like if they EVER got control of our government.  The Inquisiton all over again.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Well wherever you get that you can't get that from the Bible. Moses is mad at Pharoah when Pharoah refuses. The narrative blames him for those deaths.|`|AA11622701	Read the entire event some time.  You will discover that on four previous occasions Pharaoh agreed to let the people go in exchange for God ending earlier plagues.  Each time he then changed his mind and backed out of it.  So this final time, after Moses made his demands, God hardened Pharaoh's heart so that whatever decision he made, he would no longer be able to back out of it.    The plague had been going on for over a year and a half at this time, and it was time to bring the whole thing to its conclusion, both for the Israelites who had been abused and mistreated for that additional time, and for the Egyptian people who had already suffered through nine plagues.    While God does give man freewill, nowhere in the Bible does it say that he never violates it.  Every time God does a miracle, it is a violation of freewill, because he suspends what would have been the natural consequences of the acts and decision that took you to that point.  So a miracle deliverance or healing is identical in that respect to the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, if you are talking "free will".  The Bible very clearly teaches that God is Sovereign, and can/will do what he wills.  The majority of the time, that "will" is to allow our own free will.  But there are also times when he takes direct action because it is ultimate the best thing for everyone.  (He has that "omniscience" thing going for him that lets him known when it is the right time to step in and when it is not.)    So knowning that God always does what is ultimately going to be the best thing, it is not difficult to trust him.  Even when it may not seem to be "good" at the time it is happening.|`|AA11992885	Exodus 7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.    and can you say WOW.....you are very simple minded, if history has taught anything.......never mind, you didn't learn anything from the lessons of history, it is absurd for me to think that my words here and now will teach you|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Pharaoh would not repent he hardened his own heart first he would not let the people go .
AA11570675	Interesting article. I began to think that it's a facet of the evolution versus creation argument in that the theory of evolution needs to find some explanation for faith in some sort of God or gods, which exists in every known culture throughout the world.  Certainly the human mind wants do see patterns & will do so even where patterns don't really exist. Many experiments have been done where random occurrences are put together & most people either see or latch on to the first apparently rational explanation of events that the experimenter has taken care to ensure are random.  From birth we are likely to come across numerous events that we can neither explain nor control. In fact it would be extremely pompous to believe we can explain most things. After all our minds are finite. Therefore concepts of the inexplicable & mysterious don't fit comfortably with the way our brains work. However, it is possible to tie up a plausible explanation if we accept the thesis of the existence of the supernatural - maybe a deity or similar that exists outside the rules of the material world we perceive & inhabit. It's hardly surprising that we have the concept of a greater intelligence in charge of the world we inhabit that nurtures & protects us. After all that's exactly what we live in & with in the whole of our existence before birth! But following birth we also experience hostility & so its unsurprising that we also create the idea of one or many enemy spirits in opposition to but in accordance with the pattern of the one we've already perceived in the womb. Little wonder then that the brain is "hard wired" in this way. Without it we would be unable to shelve the stuff we can't understand or explain & concentrate on the finite amount we can comprehend.  That's not to say that there is no God. We shouldn't dismiss the idea of faith just because we can see why our brains are predisposed that way. There are many reasons to argue both for and against the existence of God, it's a conclusion we can choose to accept with all its consequences or reject with all its consequences. The article offers no conclusive argument either way.|`|wmBK9uASaa	I have heard this theory before and do concur with it.....|`|D9lMg7A2aa	The same rationality used in that article (rightly or wrongly) is used to find and worship God. IF the existence of God stands it stands without any reference to what he is talking about.    You see, he is going way past even that quote. 'Even where there is none'. Like reason is off-and-on dependable like a flickering light bulb (except for him of course).

85aR55Bwaa	You nailed it, Sister!  Not much else to be said...As the body of believers, we can always refer to to Paul's instructions to us, (our purpose statement so to speak)...    Romans 12:1-21    I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.|`|oWEVCCP0aa	Yes, always has. Such a lovely question ((((Abide)))).    Yes  Yes  Most definitely!

Jesus wants us to be planted like a tree beside the water (of life - Him (parenthesis mine)  The horizontal prayer you talk of is why we gather in the church house and share our prayers with others.  there is power in numbers.  This is also relative to the parable about the men building houses - one in rocky ground where it stood and one in sand where it fell.  We need to be deep "rooted" in Christ and build on the "rock" Jesus Christ if we expect to weather the storms of live that we face.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	The Secret of Spiritual Power       They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. Isa. 40:31.    Much prayer is necessary to successful effort. Prayer brings power. Prayer has "subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, . . . turned to flight the armies of the aliens" (Heb. 11:33, 34).        Family prayer and public prayer have their place, but it is secret communion with God that sustains the soul-life. It was in the mount with God that Moses beheld the pattern of that wonderful building which was to be the abiding-place of His glory. It is in the mount with God--the secret place of communion--that we are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. Thus we shall be enabled so to fashion our character-building that to us may be fulfilled the promise, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people." (2 Cor. 6:16).|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	SO, asking favors of invisible friends(prayer) is "healthy"?

3MEQeHtWaa	I believe it's much more than a religion. It;'s the only one where you have a personal relationship with God. It's not about good deeds or beinga good person, but putting your faith and trust in the Lord. When you do this, good actions come out of it, but you just feel different. The feeling you get when your close with God is indescribable.. you feel so peaceful, loved, and giving. People seem to categorize christians as judgemental, snobby, and what not.. but were people too. We struggle with acting like Christ would like us to, but sometimes it's difficult.

mU2eMSi3aa	No kidding; I was reading your question too fast and I thought it said (a.k.a "Douchebag Thomas")|`|D9lMg7A2aa	How to untangle that mess.     It doesn't say he touched the scars.  It doesn't say he didn't believe in God either. The fact that Jesus didn't curse him should tell you something. But it didn't. St Peter believed in Jesus but doubted the Resurrection. You are just one confused dude.      ==============================  There are two Faiths of course  Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him. Hebrews 11:6|`|ulwXFrrJaa	Here come a throng of "Thomas needed to see to believe.  Blessed are those who have not seen and believe"    A guy that lived, walked, and bore witness to Jesus' miracles could not believe he rose from the dead.  He needed to feel the wounds.  2000 years later, we are asked to have more faith than Thomas without getting to walk, live or witness any miracles.  Its a crock of crap.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Thomas had as much faith as any of the other Disciples: none.    If the stories about Jesus are true, they were eye-witnesses to his power and didn't need faith; they already had facts.    The better question is not why Thomas should be singled out for special treatment, but why those living today are held to a different standard than those living contemporaneously with Jesus.|`|AA11220299	There is a lot of difference between doubting some incident and doubting in the Person of Jesus Christ. Thomas had implicit faith int he Person of Jesus Christ which would bring him salvation, though he doubted the disciples word that they had seen Jesus. You don't get to heaven by believing what someone else says.|`|dbw210qqaa	Thomas did worship Him saying my Lord and my God    John 20:27-29 (King James Version)     27Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.      28And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.     John 20: 29Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	he is permanently dead, just like all the other biblical characters (that is those who actually existed in the first place)|`|31M2IDw2aa	Thomas DID accept Jesus before he died.  He accepted him, however, because he had 'seen,' and not by faith alone.  He did have faith, but it was weak.    Thomas is like the man who finally believes because he discovers God by the light of reason, and not by pure faith.  This belief, like Thomas' is also weak compared to the person who believes by faith, since faith is given by God himself, to those who will receive it.    This is why faith is above reason.  Faith is a grace given by God to those whose hearts allow it to enter.  Those who are not receptive to this grace can still discover God by reason.  This, however, is not as pleasing to God as it is to accept his grace of faith.     It is kind of like when you tell some fact to a loved one that you KNOW to be true, and they say, 'well, I have to find out for myself!"  And, perhaps, they do find out for themself.  You still love them, but, how much more it would have pleased you if they just trusted in you, out of love.    Jesus DID give a mild rebuke to Thomas for his unbelief by faith, and reiterated how belief by faith is greater and more pleasing to God, than belief by 'seeing.'      I suspect Thomas will do some more purgatory time versus others who accept the grace of faith.  I do believe, nevertheless, he is Heaven-bound.

I say that it is private and no one has an obligation to anyone but the IRS to disclose personal information.    Some pretend to have nothing and have it all, there's a lot of that going around and although what they have is their own, to falsely say that you have nothing is just as bad as saying that you have everything when in fact you have nothing.  Both are lies.

Its the opposite of being arrogant and boastful. Like bragging about how wonderful you are.    False modesty is pretending to be modest, but really being an arrogant, boastful person.    So like, inviting over your poor relatives to see how jealous they will be of your big, flash house so you can gloat over them, while all the time pretending to be embarrassed by all your wealth.    Or if someone says how beautiful you are, and you answer "no, i'm not" while thinking you're the most beautiful woman in the room and gloating secretly over all the others.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	False modesty is when you play down something you did in order to get more attention.

Like when someone on a TV interview gives loads of specialist data and pretentious argument and says at the end, 'but of course, I'm no expert'.

Free will is free will, whether that will brings you closer to, or farther away from the will of God is a persons choice to make. There were people that Jesus said "have nothing to do with them" religious leaders and homosexual people were among those.    However, he did not say ANYTHING about not loving them, hating them, being cruel or maligning them.     I dont know why "christians" are so hateful towards other people, the only thing I can conclude is its because they dont really know God in the first place.|`|dmCAiuMGaa	Jesus told the woman caught in adultery to "Go and sin no more."

As for Christ's treatment of such immorality He said "Go your way and sin no more",  as for my voting against Homosexual marriage, i did not as I am not a Californian. If , however I were, I most certainly would have. Which as you can see is in complete agreement with Christ.|`|qhFGj6lHaa	Legislation is not aimed at hating people. I do not hate homosexuals, I am not fond of homosexuality however. Jesus talks about disliking sin but showing love to the sinner.. Which is what I do. The legislation is badly written and takes rights away from Christian Churches however. If you look into what happens when gay marriage is legal, then you would understand better why many christians oppose it. If gay marriage was made legal in CA, then they would FORCE churches to marry gays whether they are for it or against it. Threatening legal litigation and revoking of tax-exempt status. Which is basically trashing freedom of religion. If you force a church that believes homosexuality is immoral (like it says in the old AND new testament) then you are forcing a secular belief on them which the government should have nothing to do with. Civil unions are just as legally binding as a marriage, and marriage is a religious ceremony anyway. So why is the government having anything to do with religious ceremonies?|`|yxtIpZYFaa	Jesus was one of those "nice" types, that talked about you behind your back with all of your friends.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	believers are afraid of rational thinking because they know it will make them face up to their delusional belief|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	Those hateful Christians just wont understand!|`|9X0nHkdWaa	hEHE...|`|3MEQeHtWaa	God would want the best for all of his children. In the bible homosexuality, foul language, adultery, and etc is not the best way of life. Jesus wants us to live a life pleasing to him... and follow in his footsteps. We shouldn't harass those who aren't Godly, but try to help them in a calm manner to come to Him in life.    It's not always about what makes you happiest. Some people find happiness in killing others, some in beating others, some in having sex all the time... nothing God wants for you would hurt you or hurt anyone else. Why not live for him?|`|JCnSm91uaa	Hey According to the Bible writers Jesus is coming back soon... so let's get the house back in order!    According to the Bible writers a positive sign of the impending end of times before Jesus return to Earth that hardly any Christian talks about and those who do are totally opposed to it is the FULL UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION OF SODOM to the way that it was just before its destruction!!! This FACT in the Bible proves that some high profile and politically influential Clergy persons and Preachers are PROMOTING HOMOPHOBIA on their own initiative! They are a bunch of wanking bigots some of them are gay in the closet like Ted Haggard!    Ezekiel 16:[48-49], [53], [55] (NIV) [48-49] As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you* (*what JERUSALEM did! Most Christians refuse to agree with God that according to the Bible writers JERUSALEM IS FAR MORE SINFUL THAN SODOM EVER WAS...!) and your daughters have done. Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom* (*Christian bigots ought to read the Bible more carefully to find out what was wrong with Sodom!): She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy...* (*Neither God the Father nor his Son Jesus Christ EVER MENTIONED THAT THE SIN OF SODOM was homosexuality! Jesus is making favorable statements about SODOM all along --Mat 10:15, 11:24, Mar 6:11, Luc 10:12) [53] "However, I* (*God) will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them [55] And your sisters, SODOM with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE* (*this is an UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION of Sodom. The Sodomites are not called to repent at all!); and you and your daughters will return to what you were before.    Obviously, God is clearly saying that the destruction of Sodom was a mistake, but the powerful Christian Clergy advisers to our secular leaders on gay issues are promoting a doctrine of cruel religious hatred toward law abiding minorities!  The Bible writers admit that God came up with homosexuality as part of the creation package!    Jeremiah 13:23 (KJV) Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?...    NEVER!!! So the gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and so on CANT POSSIBLE CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE!!! There is no such precedent anywhere in any in Bible story! The Jewish Bible writers admit that Jerusalem is far more sinful than Sodom! (Is it because of stories like the Priest and her lover in Judges 19-21?) The Bible God is confessing that Sodom and Gomorrah will be fully and unconditionally RESTORED to what they were BEFORE THEIR DESTRUCTION!!! There is no call for repentance AT ALL for any Sodomite before the full restoration of Sodom! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen? I know most preachers HATE THE FACTS WRITTEN IN THEIR OWN BIBLE BECAUSE THEIR INCOME DEPENDS ON GOING ALONG WITH WHAT THE CHRISTIANS OUGHT TO BELIEVE! The Mormons are wising up to this fact, too! Christianity is about the most dishonest and powerful religion in the world second only to Islam!    According to the Bible writers the restoration of SODOM must be taking place right now before the 2nd coming of Jesus!  If so, then there is nothing wrong with the same sex marriages going on in our very days!!! And I wonder why Christians are so passionately AGAINST the fulfillment of Bible prophecies that they dont like. The most popular preachers today are the ones most opposed to TRUE Bible prophecy fulfillment! You must know that the Sodomites were much holier and far more respectful of women than even Righteous Lot was. Lot pledged his virgin daughters to be married to heterosexual SODOMITES who believed in virgin purity until marriage!!! (Gen 19:14) It was Righteous Lot delivering his own virgin daughters for the unrestricted pleasure of some gay Sodomites who were looking for the strange male visitors who INSISTED on spending the night out in the main street of Sodom NOT AT ALL at Lots pad! (Gen 19:2-3) These angels or messengers of God knew where the action in Sodom was at and they wanted to spend the night in the middle of it, but Lot wanted them for himself!  Also, these Guardian(?) Angels didnt know how many people Lot had in his family they didnt come looking for Lot! (Gen 19:12).  Abraham didnt tell them that his nephew Lot lived there. Christians dont pay attention to all the clues written in the Bible! They only know how to feed their traditional homophobic orientation out of this story. Anyway Sodom is destroyed.  Holy Lot lost his wife.  He started to get real drunk and was having sex with his young virgin daughters UNTIL HE GOT THEM PREGNANT! God was so impressed with Lots performance that he bestowed on Lot the Eternal Title of RIGHTEOUSNESS throughout the Bible, Old and New Testaments in triplicate according to the number of the members in the Holy Trinity! Lot was a legal resident of Sodom!    2 Peter 2:7-8 (NIV) and if he* (*God) rescued Lot, a 1) RIGHTEOUS man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men for that 2) RIGHTEOUS man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his 3) RIGHTEOUS soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.* (*this verse in the Bible shows how hypocritical is the Bible! Even the NT idea about sin is not what the preachers and Christian Clergy peddle nowadays!)    BTW Lot was rescued out of Sodom by accident! No angel came looking for him at all! Christian dishonesty in telling the Bible story of Sodom and Gomorrah is a sham! There is no trace of evidence from any other source outside of the Bible that Sodom ever existed. I just stick to the Bible text! It is so disgusting for Bible believing Christians to hurt and persecute the gay community on a fairy tale!  Now a lot of innocent, but Bible ignorant a|`|nEc0L0MRaa	I have often asked this question myself.  I'm pagan and without a doubt Jesus of Nazarene was one of the greatest men who ever lived.

I think it is because when they read the bible they are reading it in their human nature and not reading it while being filled with the holy spirit.  Because when I read the bible I take something totally different than what some Christians take.  I see love, compassion, kindness and acceptance of all people.  I truly believe that is the holy spirit inside me showing me the true word.  Those who are not fully in the spirit cannot hear and feel the truth that comes from the bible.  However, they have their path and I believe that everyone will be brought to God when God feels they are ready...until then we will have to hear their judgmental nature and just understand that all they see in the bible is what NOT to do instead of what TO do, they serve their purpose but we just don't understand that purpose.    On another note...here is something to think about.  People who judge others do not understand them, so it stands to reason that they will have a lot of life lessons ahead of them to learn....we all have a sinful nature and those who judge others are denying that to themselves and God.  I understand sinners because I am a sinner and I am truthful about it, I have lived the life done it all...adultry, lies, stealing, betrayal, lust (long long list there - even though it was all mostly lustful thoughts), you name it...so how can I possibly not show compassion and love to someone else living that life?  Those judgmental people have A LOT to learn and live to bring them to the true Word of God.

PURPORT     Since Gitopanisad is largely based on the principles of the Upanisads, it is not surprising to also find this passage in the Katha Upanisad.                    sravanayapi bahubhir yo na labhyah                  srnvanto 'pi bahavo yam na vidyuh                   ascaryo vakta kusalo 'sya labdha                  ascaryo 'sya jnata kusalanusistah       The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing. Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.     Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one's life is successful. The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gita spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Krsna, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.    Bg 2.17 P         Contents of the Gita Summarized     This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:      balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca    bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate       "When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:      kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah    jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah       "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."       Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:                      eso 'nur atma cetasa veditavyo                   yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesa                 pranais cittam sarvam otam prajanam                  yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty esa atma       "The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence.

We aren't bodies with souls, we are souls that happen to live in bodies. Have you ever heard of 21 grams? well it kind of stems from experiments done on dying people and dying animals in the early 1900'sby a man who I think his name was McDougall... and it was an Astral Theory he was trying to prove. When animals died, the lost no weight.. but when humans died on the scale they instantaneously lost a minimal amount of weight. It is pretty interesting.    I don't know if we are made so we can see souls in this life, but I know there is a lot we can't see. I couldn't exactly tell you what a soul is, I guess I could say a spiritual being/entity|`|8lzBktaeaa	Yes, you do, everyone has one, its your most inner self/consciences. Its that little voice that tells you if its a good idea or not. Listen to it, and develop a relationship with it. Youll later realize what kind of a chaotic/ disturbed world we are living in. Mass media distracts you so that you dont realize this. Act like a human in other words.|`|3HBS3fWraa	Each individuated Soul is a spark from the Soul of the Absolute and it holds all knowledge and wisdom.  In other words:  The Soul of God, (The Absolute; Mother Father of the Cosmos, The One Truth ....whatever name you wish to use), which is pure spirit divided itself into the souls of  all living creatures including the highest manifestation of man. Therefore we all have within us the divine spark.|`|vHxauOyeaa	This is an unanswered question.   If it is something I would have to say that I like to blend religion and science together (This is not Christian Science or Scientology, I strongly dislike them) I would have to say though that the soul is the electricity we produce to stimulate thought and emotion. These are the cause for why and who we are... all thought is connected through connections in the brain called synapses. These can bind improperly and make us completely different people sometimes. Anyway... if you want to talk about the soul that goes to heaven and all that... you might have to worry instead about this: I believe that the soul is based in the electricity... our love for things and our actions towards everything are based on the fact that our synapses are still firing. SO when you die, I believe that this energy that is relatively unseen leaves our body... yes... they got that part right, but I don't think it leaves earth or this dimension or anything of that sort. I think it just recycles back into nature... and you will not live again, but you may be part of some other living things, as we are all made up of the same matter composed and decomposed second by second... but that I believe is the truth of the soul.     good luck with your question.    To defeat other arguments... your soul is not your conscience. your conscience is developed over your lifetime and based on moral codes that you have accepted as true. if any one of us was put in a room with another human being, there would be some sort of cannibalism eventually. One either dies and the other one eats... or one kills other one and eats. We have within us an instinct to live. Maybe that is a soul or just your brain's fight or flight function.

Just put 'em in a box and put the box somewhere he can't find them.  Let him wonder what you did with them and when he confronts you, tell him you never saw them.  Surely he didn't leave them in the living room, right?  You'd agreed that he wouldn't do that anymore, after all.  So they must be in his room.  He should go look there.     And when his birthday rolls around, you have a present all ready to go.  Win-win all around.

Jesus will step out on the cloud and call for the Holly Ghost to come home and every one that He is in is immediately gone. and every one that does not have the Holly Ghost will stay, He will not come out and call each by name , the bible refers to 10 virgins that took there lamp and 5 for wise and 5 were foolish , the 5 wise took oil for there lamps which the oil represents the Holly Ghost , and the 5 foolish had no oil,  and when the bride groom came , which is Jesus and called for them the ones with oil went to the marriage , and the 5 foolish were left.

They are already here and there's more of them to come.    Matthew 27:51 At that moment the curtain in the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart, 52 and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead 53 after Jesus' resurrection.

They investigate the judgment books.    Earth is completely empty because all the wicked were destroyed.

We may be approaching the end times more or less  as you look around the world and see the troubles , read the book of Daniel and Revelation and you will see approx where we are and what is coming at us .

uuQrhnJ4aa	There aren't any govt programs for such. Unfortunately, cars are not considered necessities even though you have to get to doctor's appts.     What you can do is apply with your county dept for council on aging. They also help the disabled. Someone from the agency will come out to your house for a face-to-face interview. They approve you relatively quickly (compared to food stamps & medicaid in my area which are also county svcs). Of course, you have to be legally disabled w/documentation & they will walk around your house's interior to determine what services will benefit you. The interviewer is usually a nurse or social worker.     The services they can help you with are volunteers will drive you to doctors appointments, to the grocery, on errands, etc., but u have to let them know well in advance since the program operates on volunteers.    This agency also operate the meals on wheels program to deliver cooked meals to your house if you have difficulty preparing them. However, this program has had so many budget cuts that ppl are having to get fewer deliveries per week.     You see the difference here? This agency provides svcs to enable you to see doctors & be fed. Those things are necessary.     As for donated cars...sometimes a church will donate one. Very few, though & under special circumstances. I only know of 2 instances in the hundreds of disabled ppl I know in 2 states. This particular church was Episcopalian. Ppl are members...they don't just do it for ppl off the street. (Many churches do offer food pantries open to the public, tho. They have a limit on the amt of food you get & how often u get it.)|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Go through your County welfare office, they take in donations for autos and by qualification give them to the needy.|`|BevylvVSaa	I have never seen anyone get assistance to get a car, only to get assistance with the costs to modify a van or a car. Being disabled alone does not entitle you to hand-outs.|`|AA11788494	I saw a billboard to donate cars to Good Will.  Check that site out.
j5y1pONfaa	This isn't a laughing matter because I can tell by your post you are really upset. The truth is I think your gf is overreacting. It was a rude prank and even though she didn't think it was funny she had a poor excuse to break up with you over it. Did you REALLY not know he was doing that? You may not have been in on it but you must have knew. Regardless if you knew or not her reaction was immature. If she won't listen to you and refuses to make up then maybe you should start taking in that you guys are broken up. I'm sorry your hurt but you can't force someone to come back.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Let it go, honestly, would you want her in your life if she's that sensitive and childish? You explained, your brother should apologize too, but the bottom line is, she is way too uptight.|`|AA11828439	I guess she really wasn't that into you.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	I think you can do better without her. Crying over stuff like that is just too lame and stupid. What more to say dumped you? Can you imagine if she face something bigger? The girl needs to get a life.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Find a new girlfriend.    If you really didn't know what was going on, then you're pretty stupid.    I'm betting that's what she thinks too.  She's through with you dude.|`|rThIVk2maa	Well your brother may have done you a favor here. This girl sounds VERY sensitive if she doesn't know how to laugh off a really tame prank from a 13-year-old (what did she expect? he's 13!!). Also she refuses to give you the benefit of the doubt.     Taking those two things into consideration, think long and hard if you want to keep somebody around who acts like this.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	The main you can take from this is a good life lesson.  You and your brother are used to pranks, but now you know that their are people who don't appreciate your humor.  Everyone thinks different.  Some people don't view jokes as funny.  Until you really know somebody, you have no business pulling pranks on them.  Now I understand that it was your brother who did the prank, but maybe you could have protected her a little more from his actions.  Did you start laughing at the joke after it was done or did you grill your brother about what a jerk he was and make him apologize?    I don't know if you can get her back.  I would suggest having your brother apologize to her and then to say that you were not in on the prank.  Let a little time go by and contact her again.  If she decides to forgive you - great.  If not, it is time to move on.    If you and your brother profusely apologize and she still refuses to have anything to do with you she is most likely not worth going after anyway.  I think what your brother did was wrong, but it was all in good fun.  If she is going to be that sensitive - and you are as fun loving as you are - my guess is you'd never last anyway.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Hmm....hasn't replied in a week you say?? Sound like its time to find a new girl. Maybe this time you'll get one with a sense of humor.|`|BUCwZYnzaa	screw her. if she wants to be a big baby because she sat on a whoopi cushion then whatever. i think it is funny.|`|oZ8onqsLaa	Sounds like she was looking for an excuse to dump you.     Whoopie cushions are funny.. Always!|`|0s93q8Ocaa	You KNEW your brother likes to play pranks on guests.  Admit it.  You must have laughed when she sat down on that cushion.  Admit it.  You thought it was funny.  Admit it.    It's going to happen again in the future...with anybody.  Some people will tolerate it and laugh it off.  Some people will be VERY upset.      Ask yourself.  What kind of personality do you want to be with?    BTW, control your brother.|`|drxspOUwaa	Honey, you were in on it. If you knew that this was common practice on your brother's part, you should have realized he was going to try it. What is amazing to me is that your parents allowed their guests be subjected to such antics. How rude and disrespectful.   If you want to fix this, you should have your parents take the little (excuse me- brat) over to her house to apologize himself, while explaining to her that until her reaction it had never occurred to them how humiliating and obnoxious such a stunt would be interpreted. Good luck.|`|6GOhTIXNaa	If she's that uptight you're better off without her.|`|HTpB1Cupaa	first assumptions. your brother is her best friend.  your brother is 13, so i assume, she is 13 too (more or less).    So she's a bit immature, emotionally, that's to be expected.    If you are any older than this age, pick a girlfriend that is more mature, not unless you want like this "teeny bopper" mentality.    Imagine that. you got dumped because your brother played  a practical joke on your gf.    ha

AA10214265	You'll have to do your own legwork. And any shop that does have a costume to rent won't be calling it "Elmo". More than likely they'll call it a "red monster" or something like that.     It is a violation of copyright to sell or rent copies of licensed characters from Sesame Street, Disney, etc. Shops that do get sued.|`|AA11537580	just use the phone book and call around  most will have one to rent

The world would be a much nicer place.    :)|`|xLj4nilXaa	I wanna be a Broadway star!!!|`|KaAXJJo8aa	I want to hurry up and finish college.|`|Fex51ntIaa	A higher standard of questions on this website.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	i just want a burger and fries :-) and a good movie. thats what i want.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	I want... hmm, ultimate life's want? For God to be proud of me.. that would be amazing. But yeah, I'd love a big humongous family, to be a good mother, and to have lots of animals.    We'd be one of those households where everyone is running around, all crazy, but happy (most of the time). I want to write a book. I want to travel the world. I want to be respected. I want to go back to the good old days. And now I want to stop saying "I want" :)|`|VsamHLPOaa	The world and everthing in it.|`|aoa4jCjdaa	i want everyone to be happy|`|drxspOUwaa	I want to succeed at the things that mean the most to me, being a good mother, a good friend, a loyal mate, and most of all becoming a person who wants to do right in the eyes of my God.|`|LZagOwOKaa	I'd like to be good enough, but that's just never going to happen|`|KgCUpE5naa	I want my band to become the biggest thing evar.

0HoEsupCaa	I'm mexican, and white. My hair is reddish, my skin is pinkish-whitish. WTF with mexicans don't wanting you cuz you're too light? where did that happen to you? that generally is viceversa.   where do u live? (name the city)|`|zIiiqNGBaa	Im Mexican and I really dont care if another Mexican is dark or light. Ive been to Mexico and ive seen some very light people over there. I just dont like people who claim to be Mexican but know nothing about their culture because thats one of the most important things in a Mexican family. Parents want their children to know where they came from or how much they have struggled to get into the position they are now. Just dont listen to those people.|`|xB4A5RYVaa	It's just some people are ignorant and superficial. It's like my family, they are racist.|`|a71381529322ce562ebd2834d4d77ba3aa	i don't know why skin color has always been a big deal. unfortunately, there will always be some sort of prejudice against EVERYONE. sometimes i get crap for being a pale red-head. oh well...i know that i'm gorgeous just the way i am, and i appreciate differences in people.|`|iKyxxAo6aa	whaaat!!?! mexicans love light skined girls dont they? weird but your skin shouldnt matter. they're dumb and i wouldnt bother|`|aDXsUPYRaa	Nothing wrong with that. that it's just the way you are. and people who didn't like it, *** off. i want you
