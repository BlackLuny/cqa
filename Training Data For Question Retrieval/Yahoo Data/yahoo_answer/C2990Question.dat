20090128185649AAPpGl8	Environment;Global Warming	Should the government provide incentives for planting and retaining mature trees in cities?	Mature trees can mitigate huge amounts of CO2 as well as help to maintain the water table.  Shouldn't it be possible to plant so many trees in cities that some of the effect of forest loss would be mitigated?
20090128150952AA0kgLW	Environment;Global Warming	Why does no-one realise global warming is a myth?	sorry i added this question again, but it was (in my opinion) unfairly removed by Yahoo.   so what is offensive about this post then??
20090128143122AAP4lmM	Environment;Global Warming	If global warming is real?	Then why were the Vikings able to farm and support a fairly large community of villages and towns in the country of Greenland (which is now mostly ice and unable to grow crops in the area where the Vikings had settled)     That would mean that when the Vikings got to Greenland the area they settled in was obviously warm enough to support crops, And now it is not( The area they settled) So would that not lead support to the idea that the earths weather moves in cycles and that Global warming may be real but for an entirely different reason?
20090128182428AAInTPq	Environment;Global Warming	I'm still trying to understand. Have patience with me?	I'm learning a little more with each question I ask.  I keep asking them because the info I'm finding on the internet is mostly over my puny head, except for a couple of websites recommended by people here.  From reading answers here, it seems like many of you are scientists.  So my lay-man follow-on question is:  If global warming IS just a part of the natural cycle of things in Earth's climatic history and not man-made, isn't it still a good thing to reduce carbon emissions?  I mean like wouldn't it be easier to breathe in traffic congested areas?
20090128171430AA0U7sl	Environment;Global Warming	What happens to plants after Climate Change (Heat Warms Up)? ?	So far I have a bit of info, but I need to edit it soon...      Climate change affects plants by forcing plants to move to a cooler environment such as, higher grounds and the north. It is much to hot for plants to survive in the south, so they spread through to other places.       Can someone please fix this up and give me info? I need to know for a project

20090128192550AAjYRSp	Environment;Global Warming	Do you believe that increased atmospheric CO2 will increased global vegetation?	If you believe that increased CO2 will result in increased global vegetation, how do you balance this claim with Liebig's Law of the Minimum - "The growth of a species is limited by the whatever required nutrient is least available" On land the limiting factor is usually nitrogen in the soil, and in the ocean phosphorous?

20090128192240AAeLUyA	Environment;Green Living	"Green" transportation? Why not horses?	I know we're creatures of comfort and masters of technology in this day and age, but if we really want to save the planet and save money on gas... why aren't more of us just riding horses? I know it would suck for long-distance transportation, but since most of our daily car-rides are only for (relatively) short distances, couldn't a return, in some sense, to the days of saddles and buggies save us some green, and make the world a little more green in the process?      Just curious...

Also, no links to pro-global warming arguments, if I wanted such fake information I would watch the news.
