20090306214401AASu1Vd	Environment;Green Living	How important is it to clean out a product (like an empty can) before recycling?	It seems like cleaning them out is what deters most people & it does waste water when you think about it. For materials like plastic & metal isn't it basically the same if you have a clean bottle or a bottle with some residue on it because they are both going to be melted down? Thanks

Find out the current federal government plans for the construction of new storage or even re-processing facilities in Australia. For example, Woomera in South Australia has been a proposed location for the storage of waste. What else has been proposed?      What implications would there be for Australians if we built a reprocessing facility?         Where should it be built?         Will transportation be a concern?         How fail-proof will the transport flask and vehicles need to be?         What about security and supervision of the substance during the journey?           Will/should our government allow other countries to dispose of there waste here?

20090307140311AAf7Y0w	Environment;Green Living	Why aren't dams to make electricity so rare?	Very little US electricity comes from hydroelectricity.  WHY???  There are plenty of rivers across the US!  How is it not practical to have miles of dams to produce electricity? (ok, I guess "miles" is an exaggeration)    But see the attached article:  Ford spent $1 million to build a dam, and every year, they save $4 million by NOT purchasing electricity.  As a matter of fact, they can re-sell the extra electricity they don't use.   So my question:  Since hydroelectricity can save so much money, why is it not more prevalent?       http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/fe...

20090307135952AA4EePa	Environment;Global Warming	If the earth is going through a cycle, when will the Arctic re-freeze?	When talking about global warming, lots of people seem to say "oh its just a cycle, everyone knows earth goes through cycles, the earth is warming we didn't cause it".      Fair enough... I'm quite fascinated with the history or the Earth, dinosaurs, ancient animals, etc., so I always knew that these cycles existed. However I always understood that these cycles took place over millions of years, yet this warming cycle appears to be happening noteably faster than millions of  years.      Can someone explain how long these cycles last, and when the arctic will refreeze once it melts from this current heating cycle?
