20090131110801AAQfLVQ	Sports;Auto Racing;NASCAR	(Part 1)What are your thoughts on a new system for Cup?	This part is about the driver points (have no effect on prize money or owners points).   There have been many complaints about the Chase format, this is just a points system that I thought up the other day. I don't know if it is similar to any other form of motorsports, but I think it will reward consistency. Also it might take care of the cars that come back after a wreck just to try and gain 3,6,or 9 more points, in a car that is not as safe as it was when the race started, and normally has pieces falling off it causing debris cautions. The last position to be rewarded points would be 30th.    30th 1 point, +1 for each postions with 21st getting 10 points   20th 15 points, +5 for each position with 11th getting 60 points   10th 70 points, +10 for each position with 6th getting 110 points   5th 125 points   4th 140 points   3rd 155 points   2nd 175 points   1st 200 points      The positions are worth more the closer you get to the front. I mean why should I get the same 3 points for passing the 11th place car that I got for passing the 42nd, and the the next five are worth only one point more, and ditto for the next five after that? It is hard getting a top ten nowadays, the rewards should reflect that. No doubt NASCAR competition has changed over the last 35 years, but they are basically using the same reward system (not counting the Chase). And with this format I don't think the Chase would be needed. There is going to be excitement every race. Every driver is going to go out and try the get that next position, because it is worth so much. They won't settle for 12th knowing three spots will be 25 points (where now they would have to make it to 6th in order to pick up 23 points).      So, what do you think?

The thing that I really want to know is how come everyone one believes in the bs in the movies and believe monks know how to fight. If they are following their religion they do not need to know how to fight because they are following Budhist religion.

20070327160404AAZDwbS	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Who scored that amazing World Cup Goal I saw when I was young?	OK, maybe someone can help me. I remember seeing an amazing goal in the World Cup when I was small but I don't know the player, the teams involved or even the World Cup!!!!!!   All I can do is describe the goal... I think it must have been during the 1978 tournament or the 1982 tournament, but I'm not sure.      The player was far to the side of the goal mouth, near the touchline. He struck the ball and it curved in very strangely to enter the goal. There was some debate about whether he was actually going for the shot in question. His strike looked more like a cross than an attempt at goal, but it changed direction abruptly at the last minute, not really like a banana shot. It didn't look like a deliberate shot but it didn't look like an accident either! It could have been either!      I seem to recall that he was wearing a green shirt, but I could well be wrong about that. Can anyone enlighten me? I've tried using google to no avail! I just don't have enough information about it!

Hes a good player (better than gardner) and i think he would be fine there. It would improve the lineup. They should put joba in bullpen and think about bringing up phil hughes or aceves to battle it out in spring training. ALso, with Ben Sheets still out in the free market i dont know why they dont give him a 2 year corntract or 1 year with an option. It would be a steal becuase no one else wants him.

Prior to going fishing for carp in the South Branch of the Raritan River I asked for an advice on this forum, and was told that carp eats anything. So, we went to the South Branch of the Raritan River, installed our fishing gear and waited. All of a sudden a giant (5'5) jumped out of the South Branch of the Raritan River, and started shouting at us. It said that if we thought that it was going to eat our baits, we had another think coming. It shrieked that it was vegetarian, and could detect non-vegetable oil in the bait. It said it was too greasy, and bad for its cholesterol level, and asked us if we wanted to poison it, or maybe even kill? It said it was careful of its health, and would not subject his liver to our so-called "dainties". It broke the fishing rods, dropped the pieces into the South Branch of the Raritan River, slapped its tail at us and told us to get lost, which we did. Its piercing shrieks could be heard for miles away. The bad thing is, it wrote to the American carp society, its local attorney-general and is suing us now. We tried to say that it was not us who were to blame, but that careless person who assured us that carp eats anything. We were told to produce that person, but they are not on this forum anymore. What should we do?

Saturday evening is the VIP Gala (a must-attend!) where forty or so champs and former champs are in one room at the same time with the fans!

I go back in today and i get the BSA Sweet 17 6-12x40mm scope. They mount and boresight it.  I was wondering how to sight it in? I'm a bit confused. I have sighted in scopes before, and have had to "lead" all the shots before (leave the scope on the same place on target and shoot and see where it is then if its right and high, then i put a few clicks low and left). Do i do this the same way also? Whats the part on the front that goes 10 yards 15y 25 50 ect? and on the top, it has 100-300 yard elevation, how do i set that?

I've been skating with my old pair of rollerblades for awhile and i have gotten pretty good at them.....so i decided to get myself a tad bit better pair.     So I ordered from Amazon some new skates, astro 10 from rollerblade, and when i got them the wheels are so extremely sticky that the skates do not really turn.

20090131142307AAPdG18	Sports;Winter Sports;Snow Skiing	Cost/quality of rental ski/poles/boots at resorts?  ?	I've never been skiing, and plan to go next week for the first time.  I will be getting a free equipment rental as part of a beginner package, but am curious what it typically costs to rent the boots, poles, and skis?  This is a small resort in southern PA, not a big fancy place like Vail.  Also, what is the quality of typical rental stuff?  Is it total crap or just typical beginner level equipment like one could buy at a ski shop?       I'm not thrilled with the idea of wearing boots that have been worn by so many others as I have oddly shaped feet and fear the boots will not fit well after being worn by lots of people and never being broken in by the same foot (I mean that the inside normally conforms to one person's foot in time, and these rental boots have been worn by by people with all different foot shapes).  If I decide I really like skiing, is it best to at least go buy boots and maybe rent skis and poles until you can afford all of it??

Does it affect my grip of the ball and my ability to snap it out of my wrist to throw accurately? Obviously I will try this out at practice first but I am just curious. Also I am thinking about buying one of the nice knee braces that QBs in the NFL wear for my plant leg. I am yet to buy one because they are kind of expensive and I have never had any serious knee injuries. But I think I might wear one for protective means. But I am a scrambling QB and I want to know how wearing this metal brace will affect my straight line and horizontal speed? Will it hurt my ability to run and scramble because if it does anything serious then I won't buy myself one because my line is so bad that I have to scramble and I am already just barely fast enough to get away at the Varsity level. So what are your opinions on wearing gloves and knee braces as a QB? Football experts please respond!

20070808185506AAotxeW	Sports;Baseball	Compare and Contrast ... Barry Bonds vs Roger Clemens?	Everyone, including myself, is hating on Barry Bonds for roids ... this is justified in my opinion, because steroids tarnish the hallowed records and statistics of baseball records.      Now, people presume that Bonds use steroids for two main reasons: he got better as he entered his forties, and the size of his head now is about 5 times that of it his rookie year (and even in 1998).  But isn't the same true for Clemens.  Futhermore, each could still be using HGH in the offseason as baseball does not test for the substance as of now.      Do you think Clemens used steroids, and if so, how does that affect your view of him (as compared to Bonds, who many hate because he is the poster boy for roids)?
