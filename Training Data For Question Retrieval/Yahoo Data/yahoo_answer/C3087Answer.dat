AA11044780	I know that when I was taking the test a number of years back, the drivers exam places would leave their cones out when they were closed, and you could go practice there when they were not open.  If they dont do that any more, I'd suggest finding yourself soem cones, and finding an empty parking lot.  Now that I think about it, there is an empty parking lot right next to Liberty Elementary on Princeton Road in Liberty Township (Northern Cincinnati).  They actually have cones sitting out and set up for people to practice in there.  Sometimes there are cars in there using it, but not real often.
