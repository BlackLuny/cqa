20060924071821AAl6qDY	Computers & Internet;Internet	There are three shortcuts on my desktop that I cannot remove. Any suggestions?	They are: 1) "psa30se_en_us" (which is related to Adobe, but is not a valid WIN32 file now), 2) "DPsetup" (which is related to a desksoft.com program, which I don't recall having downloaded), and "QBeez2setup" (QBeez2 is a Yahoo game). I have searched my computer for the files, and I have uninstalled the associated programs, but I cannot delete these shortcuts. I looked on Microsoft.com, with no luck. I also checked the internet, which is how I learned what "dpsetup" is.      Help me out, you guys. These shortcuts are a waste of valuable desktop real estate.

20070414191032AADyERO	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Dell Inspiron E1505 trouble - Mute Button won't work?	Hello!  Well, for a little while now, I have noticed that the mute button on the front of my laptop will only work if I have the window that is playing the sound activated.      Say I want to mute the music I am playing in iTunes, but I am currently browsing a webpage in Firefox.  I have to go into iTunes and THEN hit the mute button.  I've tried holding it down, but that just creates an annoying sound where the music flickers on andn off constantly.      I found another question on here that seemed similar to my problem, but there was no solution.  I'd rather not have to call the Dell tech support people because sometimes they're a bit difficult to deal with.

I am suspicious because the company never interviewed me. The check came later that day, and it is not even from the same company as the one listed in the e-mails.          Is this check bogus?

So I've been trying to upload a fan video that I made but everytime I try and upload it, youtube always rejects it because of copyright issues with the song. I've tried adding an intro 'editing' the song and it still keeps rejecting it.      The thing is, one of my friends on youtube uploaded a video TODAY with the exact same song and obviously hers hasn't been rejected or muted or anything like that, so why is mine?      Also, how do i get around this? I worked so hard on this video and I want it to be seen.      I'm uploading it again right now but only this time, I changed the video's name before uploading it so there is no mention of the song name, artist or the video content. Do you think that will work?

20090225153232AASoUCs	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Pseudocode? I have a problem writing this.?	You are the owner of a vegetarian pizzeria and you want to write a program to allow the customer to order only ONE pizza online. You will prompt the customer for his/her name, pizza size being order (small, medium, or large), and pizza type being ordered (veggie or cheese), and then input this data. You are to output the customer name, pizza size, pizza type, and cost of pizza back to the customer. For a veggie pizza, small costs $10, medium costs $12.25, and large costs $14.50. For a cheese pizza, small costs $7, medium costs $8, and large costs $9. Be sure to validate the size and type of pizza, and if the data is invalid, output an appropriate message to the customer.      I don't understand how to write this as a pseudocode. This is not my homework. This is an extra problem I'm trying to do on my own to understand how to do other kind of pesudocode's problems.

20090128154147AAhaVBe	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Joomla Login Probelm?	I'm running Joomla 1.0 (1.0.14 I believe) and I've been having problems with logging into Joomla. From what I can tell, every single time I log in, I eventually get taken back to the login and I have to log in again.      It does that only the one time, per session, and after I log in the second time, it's fine; everything loads properly and doesn't come up again.      That was fine; it was annoying, but that was it. Another problem, along the same lines, is starting up that's making it impossible to get back into Joomla and I have to wait, I don't know how long to get back in.      There have been a couple of times in the last 1-2 weeks, where my computer locked up or I just plain got booted out of the system, possibly because I was idle for too long - I don't know. But when I tried to log back in, it wouldn't do anything. I'd put in my user name and password and click submit, the screen would change, as if it were processing it, but instead it comes right back to the login page - and it does that every time I'd try to log in. On the first two occasions this happened, it was getting late as it was, so I just left it be for the night, came back the next morning and was able to log-in just fine (much to my relief the first time it did this and I didn't know why I couldn't log-in)   Well now it happened to me again today; only this time I actually manually logged out and then realized I wanted to check something else out about a minute later - only to not be able to get back in.   After several failed attempts to get back in, I said fine, forget it; I'll wait a couple of hours and then hopefully I should be able to get back in - that was over 3 hours ago and I still can't log into the system. Why is it doing this? What's the time limit before I can be let back into the system and how can I change this so I don't have this problem any more?

I installed software for a touchscreen monitor and it gave me a warning that if I install the PS/2 version a mouse won't work anymore. Well I did it like a fool and now I don't need that driver. The problem is the software, even if uninstalled the computer still sees it as  touchscreen instead of a mouse.      Basically when you plug a mouse in where it would normally install mouse drivers it now installs touch screen drivers.      Is there a way to make the computer revert to using the mouse drivers again?      I don't have System restore turned on so that's not an option.

The power button is green (indicating it's on) and it appears to be on but the screen is blank like my computer is not recognizing my monitor or vise versa. I've had to put my big CRT monitor back on just to get online and research this.       I have doubly checked all power cords to and from the monitor, tightened and re-tightened it's connection to my tower and the outlet but to no avail!      I've been looking up similar issues like this and for some reason I'm reading something about needing a driver update for my monitor, yada yada. Why would my pc suddenly need a driver update when it's been working fine for the past few months? Has this happened to anyone else? HELP! I don't want to fork out MORE money for a flat screen monitor if I don't have to!

20090128203124AAwrWnB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	If my ESC key isn't stuck why is the command happening as if it were?	Hi,      My computer is around 6 years old or so and it's never had this problem before.  Well, except around 2 years ago I had a similar issue with the 1 and/or 3 keys getting stuck even as the keys weren't but that eventually resolved itself.  Now, out of the blue my computer (a Tangent with Windows XP) decided that I need to use the escape command more and uses it repeatedly even if I haven't pressed the button.  The command works whenever I do press the button and the key works fine.  I popped the key off to look underneath it and nothing seems to be stuck.      This is a big issue for me since the escape key affects a lot of commands I might be trying to use.  Especially when I need to log on to my profile, since I need to press ctrl+alt+del for that and the escape command vetoes that making it hard for me to log on.  Sometimes it's a bigger issue than others but I need to know if there is anything I might be able to do to fix this.  I'm not sure if it's just the keyboard being faulty or if there's a programming issue with the computer that randomly decides to kick in.      I would appreciate any help since I've tried searching for answers myself and come up empty each time.  If I can't log into my computer or use any right click command because of this other command getting stuck, I won't be able to use my computer for all that I need it for.      Well, thanks to any who help.   Wondering

He also used my email to sign up for bunches of spam and trashy stuff.       He threatened me and called me every name in the book.    I reported him to the website and they said they would delete the posts... but, they havnt.       *** now, someone (i am assuming him, or a phishing website he signed me up for) has changed my personal emai's password. (which holds passwords for everything.)      I am terrified.    I dont know what to do.    thanks for your help.

20090225154050AAGteYU	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer going to fry due to low Power Supply and lot of freezing?	Hi,   I bought a computer with a 300W included, and switched my Graphic card to something that requires around 450W. I did not have a clue until I had lot of "freezing"(the screen changes colour and nothing responded) during games. However, things have been going okay when I put everything to low resolution.   I'm thinking about changing the power supply in about a year or two, but not now.   So I just wanted to know if my computer is going to "die" because I have to restart the computer from times to times, manually, when I'm playing games, due to freezing?      Thanks
