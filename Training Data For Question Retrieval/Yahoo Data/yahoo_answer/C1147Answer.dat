ovPfkHSCaa	Your skin is the most sensitive organ in your body and the way you handle your skin must also imbibe this sensitivity.

6jcEtPPKaa	If it's a formal dress then wear some white pumps, no straps above ankle. If it's and everyday dress then wear white flip flops, or low heal sandals. White is the best color to go with because it won't make you look like a halloween treat. You can buy a white bracelet, pin your hair up, wear a ponytail, simple petite necklace (silver it's ok). Buy some white sunglasses. D&G makes nice ones, or just go to Ross and pick out some cute xoxo or Guess ones. Go easy on the makeup because the dress is orange. Hope this helped. You will look fine. Oh, I almost forgot. Get french tip nails (both feet and hands).|`|Ihfj1lRmaa	Gold bangles and some gold strappy shoes.|`|8kfGyvlfaa	go with silver jewelry<br>  <br>  and silver ballet flats<br>  <br>  try and find some grey tights|`|6zCm65haaa	ermm u cud try a bag over ya head so no1 can see u lol only jokin it depends wot kind of orange and brown n orange go i cant even think of a ova colour that i wud wear wi orange|`|V6dz395kaa	Well if it is spring wear wear orange flip flops!|`|2s9IZU7xaa	try wearing a white sweater with white sandals or mix a lot of silver into the outfit|`|zO0CFFvCaa	a green hat too look like a pumkin =]|`|feUtQ0GBaa	BLUE<br>  anythin blue<br>  maybe u can get a blue belt and put it around ur waist or right under ur bust...maybe a blue necklace, blue earring, or blue shoes<br>  even tho it sounds silly n u mite think u look like a clown blue and orange are complimentary colors and they look very good together.|`|6GWSI2XEaa	I would wear it with natural beads in both wood and semiprecious stones, and a pair of big gold dangly earrings.

AA11481224	clearly low cut isnt the right style for you<br>  <br>  get pants that fit|`|V6dz395kaa	Maybe get a long shirt so no one will see it falling and when u feel it falling pull it up quickly!|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	Well, you know..you are wearing LOW rise jeans..so just waer a longer shirt or something ot just use the loops for a belt.

And it's okay to use the belt loops, just don't yank hard. Having something tucked in the pants will help it to sit better on your hips. I had that problem until I turned eighteen, then my cousin showed me what she did and I do the same thing. Works like a charm.|`|ZI2nae2Qaa	maybe dont buy low rise jeans

Au4gWgEiaa	I got mine done about a month ago, and it did hurt more than other piercings.  Basically how he did it, was he pierced the front hole first (the one that is closer to your face) and put in the barbell.  That was what hurt the most as the cartilage is thicker there (He was putting enough pressure to make his hand shake putting the needle through, it was intense for a couple seconds but worth it!).  The second hole was really nothing, and he put the barbell through that hole and it was done.  It did bleed a little, but I would say it was my best piercing experience thus far.  I did not hear any crack or crunching, but everyone is different.  <br>  It cost me about $80.  The care is just like any other piercing.  Keep your hair away from it, try not to sleep on it for the first while (it will hurt), clean it once a day with soap (I use regular bar soap, unscented), try to do at least 2 sea salt soaks per day.  The more soaks you do, the better as it helps oxygen get to the piercing so it can heal.  You may get a bump near the hole, it's called hypertrophic scarring and it is very common with cartilage piercings (I got it on my helix, and also have it on one hole of my industrial).  It will go away in time.  <br>  Hope this helps you out!  I was really nervous about getting it done, but just remember to breathe while its happening and it's over before you know it! :)

R7ACldBKaa	not fat so there's more rolls than you can grab...<br>  not skinny that when you hug them you can map out every bone on her body...<br>  not athletic that she's more fit than the guy (we'll get more jealous/self conscience)...<br>  not short that we have to bend at the knees to hug you...<br>  <br>  I'd say a girl about 5'4-5'6...not sure exact weight (b/c they never tell us) but enough fat that you can pull some "flab" with your fingers...ya know?|`|AbN6Natmaa	im not a guy but different guys like different girl. what type of guy do u want 2 like u?|`|IAIBzgOgaa	volumptuous|`|2pwIT6TXaa	rolls of fat hangin out, mm keeps me warm.|`|ZTTdm4dWaa	Most guys like petite-sized girls who are around 5'3"-5'5", but only on special conditions. Girls that are too skinny just look really freaky and can "repel" guys. Also, the clothes you wear is definitely a big part in this. Skinny girls wearing baggy clothes don't look too cool. If you have an athletic build, try to wear clothes that show off your body. Also, I don't think much guys will go for a fat or chunky girl.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i know they like my petite curvy body|`|3nmBkBvOaa	all of your answers will be different.<br>  every guy has different tastes.
XdMcYDgbaa	if i were you, im a guy, i would go out with him even if you think youll never have a relationship...just get to know him. dont hurt his feelings. im trying to say just be friends with him. and if he wants to take it to the next level...stop him right there, thats if you still dont want him.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Stop leading him on, you're no better than the last girls that were "such bitches to him".|`|FJU82Ycmaa	It would be best if you nip this in the bud right away.  Don't go on a date with him just cuz you feel sorry for him.  It's a waste of your time as well as his.  Just let him that you have been giving it some thought and you just don't think you two should be anything more than good friends. Let him down easy, but it will be better in the long run if you just tell him the truth upfront. hope things work out! peace|`|BGNdKvXzaa	No.  Tell him now, before things get complicated, that you made a mistake.  It is a far worse thing to lead someone on than to reject them.|`|kUhcypC9aa	If you aren't into him then dont make a fool of him and pretend you are :) x|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	you can give him a chance, but you need to tell him straight up that yes, you like him as a friend and you are only doing this "date" thing to see if you like him in another way. you are not guaranteeing that anything is going to happen, but you are giving him the benefit of the doubt. try and have fun when you go out, don't dwell on the fact that you don't like him romantically. and then after the date, wait a few days before you tell him, again, that you like him as a friend better than as a romantic interest. point out the fact that you did give it a shot and it just didn't work for you. if he's gonna be an a** about it, it's his problem not yours. be honest from here on out, though. it's not your job to make everyone feel good...|`|wWUV6WERaa	If you really don't want to, tell him you don't want to ruin your friendship if you two break up, xD|`|QmVEuNljaa	yes, you should get married and have lots of clingy weird babies... no end it before you get too deep|`|Ji0akFDGaa	give it a try|`|bkNs0b5Faa	Sure, why not? <br>  If you don't you could end up regretting it. You'll continuely think about him most likely and possibly develop feelings for him. And eventually he'll move on and you'll regret never even experiencing having a relationship with him. Who knows, you could really fall I love with this guy. You already seemed confused about all this and if you don't give him the chance you'll become more confused and probably feel like those bitches he liked before x) you'll never know how you truly feel unless you give him the chance. If it doesn't work out, explain that to him. At least you won't live in regret of never giving him the opportunityto show he cares.|`|haEyto7Paa	Everyone makes mistakes. You thought this would boost his confidence...you were right. This probably brought his "I'm Awesome" Meter 2-3 notches up.<br>  "I'm so glad we're gonna be more than friends...." is what he said?<br>  At that point, he's jumping the gun and it's probably not going to work out. Who knows, he may actually be a really nice guy. But to assume that you two are going to be "more than friends" is just kinda jumping the gun.<br>  You start out in a relationship as friends and work your way further. It's just the way it works.<br>  As far as giving him a chance. It IS completely up to you. Do you feel comfortable talking to him? Are you thru being nice?<br>  Maybe just have you and a group of people go out and have a good time, see what he's like around other people. Just tell him you aren't ready to date right now, you'd rather be "just friends"<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jBeBIGYqaa	In early Jnauray I was in this situation...sort of. Ill tell you how it went down.<br>  <br>  Ok, in december, this guy asked me to go ice skating with him and his church. I decided I would go, bc I kinda liked him. and we held hands and skated. I liked him without even really knowing how he acted. I flirted with him for about a month (january) and I thought I really liked him.<br>  About a week later, I decided I didnt like him anymore, and I tried blowing him off. When he asked to walk me out to my car, I told him I didnt really want him to but he insisted, and I just let him to be nice.<br>  Then, he finally asked me out. Even though I didnt really like him, I said yes bc i didnt wanna hurt his feelings. Hes a nice enough guy, but hes wayyyy annoying because he always has to be right about everything.<br>  Anyway, I wouldnt do it just to be nice girl.<br>  It ruins friendships. Because now we dont even talk.<br>  <br>  My advice: No. Do not do it.

jmEv4XBWaa	Hiya (:<br>  I have very fair and extremly oily skin too !<br>  The Dream Matte mousse from Maybelline is really easy to apply and it doesn't look like you have it on ! <br>  It doesn't make your skin oily and clogged up either and you can barely feel that it's on. <br>  It was the first foundation i've ever used and i've never used anything else. <br>  I find it awkward to use my fingers so I just use make up pads. <br>  I aslo don't thing that it works too well with make-up sponges. <br>  I use it all over my face and then i put on a few dabs of conceler onto the worst blemishes. <br>  The conceler that i use is from mabelline aswel so it's the exact same colour. <br>  I have fair skin too and I use the shade "Ivory"<br>  Hope This Helps (:|`|xKyBUnesaa	If you have oily skin I would recommend to use a tinted moisturiser. A lot of brands do these now and because they most are non comedogenic they don't clog your pores. they are light weight and non greasy on your skin, and give you a nice instant glow to your skin. If your in the UK No7 do a good one, I dont know if this is in the states but nivea young range sell a tinted moisturiser which is very good. If you have oily skin the least thing it needs is foundation. Foundation is also a fast ageing process surprisingly so even if your not there yet its bad damage in the long run.<br>  <br>  if you really don't want a tinted moisturiser my favourite brands are No7, Revlon or maxfactor. These are quality foundations especially revlon and no7 they are thicker in texture, The best way to see a colour match is to go and put some foundation on your jawline and see in the mirror. don't worry too much you can always mix to foundations together if one turns out too light or dark. Or speak to a makeup counter assistant.|`|qDd84PDpaa	Right well if your skin is really really fair? then try an ivory, <br>  Benefit play styxs are good, and there a concealer foundation and powder all in one. also, benefit some kind of gorgeous foundation is also very good. also Virgin vie, is very good. and mac is also good, like i said opt for an ivory if you have really fair skin if not, the next shade up should be fine. hope this helps.|`|feNedcuUaa	I use rimmel 16hr its REALLY good and it fits by skin colour perfect<br>  There are some that adapt to your skin colour if your worried about that, i have seen them advertised but not sure what make or anything sorry, Go into a shop and try testing it on your collerbone or jawline, try a few and see what colour looks best make sure you are in a good light always go for a lighter one than darker if your not sure because you could turn out orange :) x|`|bProyggzaa	whichever you use to find the right colour match and handy tip is to test it just above your jawbone and rub in if you can see any colour on it or its got lighter then change the tone either way|`|2l5RCy9paa	My skin sounds exactly like yours - I use Max Factor Miracle Touch Foundation in Creamy Ivory and it works a treat :)|`|VABATohgaa	Hiya!  i used to use liquid foundations, but they re really bad for your skin and give you spots! so i got 'dream matte moose' it is really good, but also very expensive however it lasts a long time!<br>  <br>  and for your colour, when your out shopping go to super drug or a makeup shop somewhere they usually have testers, find the foundation you like nad rub some on the back of your hand, if it matches that's the one for you, in winter every ones skin turns slightly paler so try and get something for winter and for summer! <3|`|NYbl7CpJaa	ok first wat ever u do ...but a foundation that is just a tad..bit lighter then yours! trust me. and i use loreal paris bare naturale in soft ivory! it is a powder and works like magic! and you can buy a 4 or 5 step pack that has fondation, blush, powder eyeliner, bronzer and more! plus it has spf 19 sunscreen.....wearing sunscrean is good for your skin to saty young...also try neutrogena cuz it has stuff that can help your pimples go away (if u have them) while covering them up! ur welcome! hope i helped!|`|btIvC1esaa	nivea

Z6lhZiXsaa	lol aww that's so cute you're a sad dinosaur! Anywho... Your plan sounds great. I assume you got the minocycline from a dermatologist? That's a good first step. Give the pills 2 months to work, then go back to the dermatologist if your skin isn't clear enough. I would only make one suggestion in your routine. Get an oil free moisturizer for your body. Cocoa butter is oil and that can clog your pores. Try Cetaphil body lotion. That stuff is great! If not that, just make sure it says noncomedogenic on it.|`|aOFdtoR4aa	WARNING! Don't Even Think About Buying Another Acne Product Until You Read This...|`|CRk1goz4aa	Dial should work. If you are active and sweat...take a shower immediately after done. Try getting a back rubber so that you can scrub your back. But you may not want to use moisturizer on your back, or wherever you are breaking out, cause it will clog up pores. This is usually something that happens to me when I have long hair. If you happen to have long hair and it's always on your back, it could be the hair products you are using....|`|8Njdzwi0aa	This stuff will stop your breakouts, it's Black Soap Elixir from SheaTerraOrganics.com     It's amazing stuff : )
uhKBBQ9raa	I was a VEET user until 2 weeks ago.<br>  Veet works great, for 2 days, then you'll start seeing all these little hairs growing... but works better than shaving! Even though it's almost the same.<br>  <br>  Now I use an Epilator! Braun Silk-Ã©pil Xelle, the pink one. The first time I used it it was painfullll! but I came out of it and got smooooooth legs for like week and a half then I used it again 4 days ago because every little hair bothers me lol, not because I needed it, and was almost no longer painful. It grabs every visible hair even the tiny ones!, and it comes with a light so you can see all the hairs you missed :) And I scrub my legs every-other day to prevent ingrown hairs. <br>  <br>  Some people say works better than waxing, because if you wax, you have to wait almost 3 weeks for the hair to grow enough to pull it out. And nobody wants to have hairy legs for 3 weeks!!<br>  <br>  I highly reccomend this epilator, even though its painful the first time, but worth it. :) xx|`|t2LOcPkLaa	I don't like shaving either so recently I started using the Veet bladeless kit. I liked it at first because I found it gave me a much smoother shave and I didn't get any razor burn. However, it smells like chemicals and you have to leave it on for at least 3 mins before shaving (so it takes longer!). Waxing will give you the closest shave but it's expensive and a hassle. So I'd either suck it up and get a better razor and some good shave gel or go for waxing.|`|jpqSnCpuaa	nair and stuff like it sucks you have to stand there in the bathroom for like 5 minutes and then it takes as long as shaving to get all the crap off your legs<br>  <br>  waxing hurts like a beeotch i will never do it again <br>  <br>  just shave and make sure you use a good razor it makes all the difference|`|3JkZPMvYaa	um u could dry shave and what i learned is that u should shave first in the direction ur hair legs grow in then shve in the opposite way . dry shaving i find faster than regular then and when u do it like that ur legs are soooo smooth its unbelivable|`|1TrWuMOraa	Veet doesn't really work that well, Nair is messing and dangerous in the sense that what if you accidently touch your head or forget to wash it off your hands and itch your eyebrows?! YIKES. Waxing is a little more spendy than the alternatives but completely worth it, especially if you get it professionally done, it lasts for up to a week to two weeks instead of days! Its a little painful at first but you get used to it, and it only lasts a couple seconds, just like if you've ever had your eyebrows waxed it almost starts to feel good after awhile weird i know. but good luck!|`|AmpW5HuAaa	Just to warn you Nair and Veet smell so bad it will make you want to gag :)<br>  And they don't work too well<br>  Waxing will kill<br>  Have you seen that new product called Smooth Away?<br>  I'm not sure if it works but you might work<br>  Guess you'll just have to stick to shaving like the rest of us D:|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	Getting your legs waxed by a professional is the best way to get completely hairless and smooth legs.

AA10799686	hi there. i really hope i can help and i believe i can. see, i have acne scars and a few blemishes and it covers them completely. Dermablend! Its a bit pricey, but when you see what it does.. it so totally worth it! See..this stuff covers everything from birthmarks, acne scars, blemishes, scars, tattoos, stretchmarks, varicose veins, pigmentation, and so so much more. Check out the website you'll be blown away with the before and after pictures.<br>   Hope its what your looking for.<br>  Ps. If you decide to get this, you can purchase it Bonton or Macys and also make sure you get the loose setting powder with it. You can get that cheaper like at walmart. Good Luck!|`|cCVIF726aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out a few different ones.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.
CRk1goz4aa	the "how" part is on the directions section of the items that you buy. What you should do is wash your face with hot/warm water....then place the mask. The peel off will help pull things up...then do the face scrub (I use St. Ives) and that will scrub away all the other stuff that's left over. and WHALA! A facial! Or if you just rub your face with hot water and then use the scrub...it will help. The hot/warm water will open your pores. Good luck!|`|06HPTp3uaa	first of all, can you type better so people understand your question. <br>  and just read the instructions on the thing. <br>  it tells you how to use them and what to use first|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	better wash with yougart weekly one time|`|TAdRXsU3aa	mask first,rinse and then use scrub for clearing any residue.
4DeahPjfaa	If your hair is naturally wavy or curly, you probably won't ever get it perfectly straight. <br>  Try washing it with straightening shampoo, then putting a product in it (like Chi or Paul Mitchell Super Skinny) and blowdry it, brushing it straight with a paddle brush, with the dryer nozzle pointing down the hair (makes it shiny). Then flat iron it in small chunks with a nice flast iron (Chi's are amazing). If it has a tendancy to curl or wave back up throughout the day, put a little hair spray in.|`|bC42lYYtaa	Use suave humectant shampoo and conditioner.<br>  It is the best shampoo I have ever used.<br>  It makes your hair soft as silk the first time you use it.<br>  And I haven't had a hair cut since last August and I still don't have any split ends.<br>  Then just use a straightener to get it straight.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the conditioner.|`|JGMWR6wVaa	I would say blow dry it straight with a round bristle brush.  Straighten the hair with a straightner.  Rub a dab of baby oil on the palm of your hands and run it through your hair.
43DIvkopaa	Braiding wet hair at night may work, but I don't know if it will stay. <br>  I use a scrunching curl gel (you could get moose too). i use garnier fructis curl shaping spray gel. just spray around your hair about 3 times, and scrunch it or twirl it the way you want and it lasts all day!|`|Qy9mH2s7aa	sleep in french braids and take them out in the morning<br>  *works best if you take a shower at nite and blowdry ur hair while it is we and in french braids then sleep on it*
wUIJSSJlaa	I love the way writing going down the spine looks.  or down your fore arm.|`|H3PcFertaa	That's a lot of skin space. Letters should be no smaller than 1/2" with good amount of skin around to hold up well over time.<br>  The script matters quite a lot. Will it be lacy with flourishes? Bold and blocky? In your handwriting?<br>  What are the possibilities? Wrapping in a long line around your arm? Going down your spine? Breaking it up into 3 rows on your ribcage? Separating each part and placing each  at a different place on your body?<br>  Your foot is out and so is the back of your neck - both too small.<br>  Try printing it out in different fonts and thicknesses, and taping them to your body. Then you will get a feel for how it will look and if you will have a clothing issue (covering words, so that strangers start to peek under your top...)<br>  When you think that you have possibilities worked out, go to your tattooist and see what he/she thinks.<br>  good luck|`|atNUZTGqaa	I think that it would look nice on your ribs or wrapped around your arm.|`|CnAVXj7maa	do something in Japanese like your name our your favorite color anything that makes you feel Special
XiOIBwbPaa	1. I have taken mine out a few times and it just looks like a whole in your nose their noses must be infected or something, because it shouldn't look nasty. <br>  <br>  2. it takes about 2 months to heal...though you can change the jewelry in the time..though I recommend going to the place you got it pierced if you want it changed then.<br>  <br>  3. yes there are invisible/ clear ones you can get ...but you can't get it when you get it pierced, you'd have to go out and buy one, then bring it back for them to change it.<br>  <br>  4. and what ever side you feel like getting it on..just get it so it even outs on our face..like if you have bangs going to one side, get it on the opposite side..if you have straight across bangs or no bangs at all then get it on either side ..OR if you have say a eyebrow, lip or cartilage piercing on one side..get your nose done on the opposite side..even if you have bangs. ..<br>  <br>  haha I hope this made sense ...PLUS nose stud are soooo cute..never go with a ring though they almost never look good.|`|jpqSnCpuaa	you really dont need to take the ring out but if you do (i do all the time) you can't really tell<br>  <br>  it took mine a loooooooonnnnnnngggggggg time to heal<br>  <br>  i have never seen a clear one but im sure they make them just ask at the shop where you get it done<br>  <br>  left side looks way better|`|u0eTvggDaa	It all depends if it heels right, Mine doesn't look gross when i take it out, it's just a tiny little hole.<br>  <br>  and for mine to actually STOP hurting it took about maybe 2/3 weeks tops.<br>  <br>  but if your going to change your nose ring out, you kind of have to do it fast, you can't just take it out and then go somewhere, or else it will close up.<br>  <br>  and invisible, no. but they do have clear ones, they are called spacer's you can find them at claire's or hottopic.<br>  <br>  and which side, left side. <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i could help!!|`|EUddyze0aa	When I take mine out it doesn't look nasty. If theirs looks nasty and red they probably aren't taking care of it properly. You don't really notice anything really. And it healed really quickly. And invisible? There definitely wouldn't be any invisible ones. Anyway I got my nose pierced years ago and I still love it.|`|1TrWuMOraa	I've had my nosed pierce for about 7 years now. It takes about a couple weeks to completely heal, but you have to make sure that you clean it with the solution, or hydrogen peroxide with a Q tip like 3 times a day whenever you have some down time so that it doesn't get infected, if it does get infected it will be like a pimple underneath the skin under the nose ring, it can be really painful but nothing to serious. So there aren't many complications with a nose peircing which is why I love it. Don't take it out or change the ring for a couple months, otherwise it will close on you. It will eventually close up if you have it out long enough even after several months of having it, like I've had mine out for several months, but if I wanted to I could take my nose ring and force it back in, because it's just the bottom layer of skin that grows back over, and it can be really painful. So make sure you remember to keep it in, and put it back in soon enough. Yes there are clear nose studs to put in for a job, or if you just don't feel like having it show. and as for the hole be able to be seen when you don't have anything in, is false, you can barely see mine unless you are searching for it, so you might have seen people who have done it themselves make bigger holes that you can see which is nasty, but if you get it professionally done at a good place, it will be almost invisible. good luck! i love having my nose pierced. Mine is on the right side. If you are a righty go with the right, a lefty go with the left.|`|KBN0vR28aa	1. when u take the ring out u can barely even tell theres aw hole there. if anybodys was nasty and red theres a chance it was prob infected : / if u take it out to change it make sure u put a new ring in right awayyy<br>  <br>  2. ur nose takes a few months to heal<br>  <br>  3. there are clear studs u can get, try hot topic. i live in CT and have a generation X around me that sells them. i've also seen a few in piercing pagoda booths. if u get ur nose done professionally, talk to whoever is piercing it and let them know u'd like a clear stud they might be able to suggest to u where u could get one<br>  <br>  4. i have mine on my left side and i love it : ) but u've just got to pick whatevers best for u !|`|9BEds3LEaa	hey i have my nose pierced on the left side, it didnt hurt and when the ring is out you cant tell that you have it done unless you dont take care of it there are clear ones but if you get your nose done by someone who is good at it then it shouldnt get too swollen, mine was only a little red for a couple days but you cannot change it too soon (mine was kept in for 6 weeks) or else you can get an infection|`|30vY9h6iaa	1. If you've been taking proper care, it is practically invisible when out. It looks like a smaller version of an earlobe piercing without an earring.<br>  2. 6-12 months.<br>  3. Yes, but be very careful that you get only high-quality materials. Acrylic is not suitable for healing piercings.<br>  4. Whichever you like!<br>  <br>  also try www.bmezine.com for more :)
essd1DYWaa	It probably happened if you used an ash color. To fix it either go to a salon or get a warm brown color to even it out.|`|9V07srI9aa	If your trying to dye your hair a brown you may have to die your hair more than once , first choose a light brown then work darker <br>  right now it probably looks ash brown or gray but just dye it gradually
MjKOBQQqaa	It's a fact that cold, windy weather dries the skin. <br>  <br>  But this dryness doesn't only occur at the surface of the skin. The deep layers of living skin cells (the dermis) also dries out.<br>  <br>  So a moisturizer alone will not work.<br>  <br>  A moisturizer will only treat the surface layer. But your face can still feel tight and dry after.<br>  <br>  Instead look for a deep moisturizing serum. This will be more appropriate.<br>  <br>  A Serum is designed to penetrate deeply into the skin. Therefore it can supply moisture to both the surface and the dermis.<br>  <br>  So instead of only using a moisturizer also consider a serum.|`|CRk1goz4aa	There are very few things that I will swear by and here is one....DOVE!!!! use Dove bar to wash your face and then use DOVE moisturizer.|`|hEAdpYHvaa	Any moisturizer you put on your skin is not going to help, it will only make your skin produce less oils on its own, therefore making it more dry. <br>  Healthy skin comes from the inside out. Are you eating enough oils and fats in your diet? Try adding avocados or olive oil to a salad to get those good fats, and you'll probably see a difference within a few days.|`|J4cSgIreaa	Hey abby, i understand what you are going through, and i agree cold weather is a tough time on skin and biore strips when used many times in a short period will put a strain on the skin and remove the goodness we need from the pores and causing it to become dry and often sore.<br>  <br>  As a mother of two young boys, who often suffer dry skin spells. i am a great believer in prevention is better than  cure, therefor i always try and use products to moisture enrich the skin and stop it from becoming dry in the first place. <br>  <br>  I have recently started using Johnson's & Johnsons Aveeno Bath and Shower oil, and Aveeno natural moisture rich cream with no perfume or fragrance. This leaves the skin beautifully smooth and locks in moisture preventing dry skin from appearing. However those products can be a little pricey. Alternatively you can use johnsons natural collections, they come in green bottles and tubs and smell gorgeous. Use the bath cream with the intense moisturiser and your skin should be beautifully soft and smooth and smell divine.<br>  <br>  Good luck

And no insurance company will pay for a non-medical procedure, even if you were an adult.|`|DHjD4DW8aa	nope|`|UkOAxlDRaa	well if it is for face reconstruction because of an accident but if it's just cuz the person doesn't like the way they look doctors proly won't do surgery on a 15 year old cuz their still growing.  anyways if it is YOU who is thinking that you want face surgery i would do it.  yer only 15 so your face may change seeing as how you have quit a bit of growing left to do.|`|OVsVIM6gaa	If it's cosmetic, no.  I don't know of any regular insurance company that will pay for anything cosmetic, no matter how old you are.  If you get in an accident or something, then I think they'd pay for reconstructive surgery.

Tell them you want your t-shirts to be marketed by a prestigous and well known company so naturally they came to mind first, be a little flattering and as polite as possible, without going over the top and ask if you can arrange an appointment where you might get the chance to pitch your product to them.<br>  <br>  If your t shirts are the kind of thing they're interested in selling, they'll generally arrange a contract for a small order of t shirts to see how well they sell and if that goes well, then things pretty much just grow from their.|`|q2kluZZWaa	website : <a href="http://www.trade9shoes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.trade9shoes.com</a>

AA12371982	Comfortable walking shoes (Nike Air Max will be my suggestions if you have a pair). Relaxed fitted jeans(or shorts) and a T-shirt or a swimsuit made for easy transitioning like something you can wear without feeling naked and appropriate for water rides and simply walking around. Just keep in mind that there are children at amusement parks so you want to be conscious about not looking too sexy if you chose to wear a swimsuit.|`|Fg89T3fJaa	Summer Weather: I always wore flipflops to Six Flags and if there are any rides where your feet hang, you just take them off. Dont wear earings on the fast rides, it doesnt turn out pretty (u start to bleed even if ur ears were perced for a while). Where a comy t-shirt or tanktop with a swim suit top underneath.... its alot more comfortable than a bra. Mesh shorts are also comfiest and especially good if u are going on water rides. <br>  <br>  Fall Weather: Bring a sweatshirt, wear sweatpants, and a t-shirt. the key is COMFYNESS! For shoes you could wear a pair of gym shoes.|`|WDLnNm7Maa	make sure u can walk around in it.<br>  u wont get too much attention with it.<br>  but if u like to flirt make it a bit flirtyy.<br>  but not too much!<br>  Uhh if it hot wear a bathing suit under your clothing,<br>  if it is cooler try comfy capries..|`|AA11672248	T-shirt, shorts and sneakers.|`|AA10197715	wear something relaxing<br>  dont wear jeans because its going to get hot<br>  wear shorts with a t-shirt and some good shoes that you are comfortable to walk in|`|q2kluZZWaa	website : <a href="http://www.trade9shoes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.trade9shoes.com</a>|`|6ADvTiS5aa	If it is a warm or hot day I would wear a swimmsuit with a comfortable pair of shorts and a T-shirt over the swimmsuit.

ojceQQ1Paa	12 days is not enough time for your ears to heal.  They will close up if you leave earrings out for that long.  The minimum time for healing is 4-6 weeks.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is going to be to wait until summer to get them pierced so your ears have a few months to heal.<br>  <br>  If you get them done and leave your earrings out for 8 hours after only 12 days, the holes will close up and you will have to keep forcing the earring though.  That will, in turn, prolong healing, and create a perfect breeding ground for infections and scar tissue.|`|6Qs1VnSfaa	I have 10 ear peircings and just about all of them say to leave the earings in for about 6 weeks before changing or taking them out. Because its less chance it will get infected.<br>  Im sure it should be alright, just make sure you clean them day and night and look after them so they dont get infected and to make the healing process a bit quicker.<br>  And just make sure you put them back in as soon as possible. <br>  Hope this helped.|`|iMaYLGECaa	mine closed up in the space of 6 hours after having them pierced for 4 weeks...its different for every person but they will heal over a bit and they will scab and get a bit ***** so itll be sore to get them back in|`|0IKhaA43aa	nopeeee.<br>  <br>  ive had mine out for like two years and they still havent closed up.<br>  <br>  :)|`|BtmAwLH1aa	no if you wear earrings from 7 to 12 days then the earhole wont shut till about 3 months.|`|qcpVR7vGaa	yes they would would. u have 2 keep them n for about 8 weeks, but they have 2 stay n the WHOLE 8 weeks. they close up fast|`|T6PzMyPBaa	yes they would close up but they wouldn't completely heal over but it would be very difficult to get the earrings back in i would imagine<br>  and don't get them done at the mall either.<br>  they are usually stupidly overpriced and guns make healing times alot longer.<br>  you'd be better getting them pierced with a needles instead of getting blunt metal forced into your ear

tvF86mRDaa	Check if any of the products you use (moisturiser) have a hint of tan to them that you weren't aware of. Maybe your skin is just more prone to tanning quicker than most? Also maybe you're at the age when your skin and hormones are changing and therefore effecting the pigmenation? Don't worry though - most would kill for skin like that, I know I would!|`|oAAr4aEJaa	The 1st thing I'd do is check to see if the milkman's black
vk6sczbLaa	Apply makeup only to clean skin. Make sure you cleanse and moisturize properly. Use products that are formulated for your skin type. Exfoliating will get rid of any dead skin cells that can make your skin look dull. Make sure to exfoliate if you have the tendency to flake -- moisturizer won't help much because you'll end up simply trying to moisturize dead skin.<br>  <br>  For deep set eyes, you want to use a lighter color on the lids to help visibly bring that forward instead of making your eyes look deeper with dark colors. So a highlight color (the lightest color, shimmer would look great) from lashes to crease, and a bit underneath the brow from arch to end. A midtone would go from your crease up to your brows. It would be slightly darker, which will help a prominent brow visibly recede a bit, drawing more attention to your eyes instead of your brow. And accent color, if you choose to use one, can be used from the outside edge of your lashes and up into the crease a bit.<br>  <br>  For colors: browns, neutrals, and purples will help the color of your eyes stand out. Because of your lighter complexion and darker hair color, you're pretty much open to use any shade of these colors.<br>  <br>  A dark brown eyeliner would work great, and black-brown mascara is really good to frame your eyes without overwhelming them (as black can sometimes do).<br>  <br>  Your favorite foundation, a dusting of bronzer, and a coral or berry lip gloss can complete your whole look.<br>  <br>  Using neutral colors are great for everyday wear, and are easy to add more dramatic colors for a night out.<br>  <br>  Hope that all makes sense.|`|uVXfuZSvaa	I think it all depends on how much make up you want to use.<br>  <br>  My makeup routine is:<br>  Foundation<br>  Blush<br>  Mascara <br>  Lip gloss<br>  Just enough makeup to make my feel good.  Now if I'm going out or if I just happen to feel extra good that day then I will combine the color of my shirt to the color of my eyeshadow and liquid eye liner in the bottom and top of my eye.  <br>  <br>  I hope this works for you!|`|e1ObJ7LAaa	okay my advice is brown/black eyeliner (but go light!!) a brown, light purple, or silver eye shadow. black mascara. hmm and a little sparkle :)|`|jL0Y27g2aa	moistrise then makeup (if you wear foundation do that first), then i would put on a gold/tan shimmery eye shadow with a small touch of brown eyeliner and some mascara|`|v8AYoQPeaa	clean,tone, spf. then some loose powder, blush, gold or shimmer eyeshadow, eyeliner, black mascara, lip gloss.|`|YQRbtyGVaa	wear a little bronzer and a little blush on your cheeks... nice natural pink.<br>  then for the eyes put some brown eyeliner with shimmery gold eyeshadow (it will really make your eyes pop), but don't over do that.... then a couple swipes of mascara and light, light pink lip gloss.

This is if you're talking about cornrow type braids.<br>  <br>  I agree with the others in that you should wait a few weeks because right after a perm is when your hair is most fragile and is more prone to breakage.|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	if you getting extentions (haird added) then wait like 2 weeks minimum and the braids will still look good and itll work with your hair being permed, also, use human hair|`|LRJmHA7vaa	I would recommend that you wait 7 days to braid giving the hair plenty of to harden back up.|`|h8pTXfHqaa	wait until 2 weeks after.
AA10472111	i use a pencil. close one eye with your hand and apply liner with the other hand. make a simple straight line in one go. to avoid the raccoon look - avoid very think and heavy liner. use more grey and blue.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	on the top i use liquid liner with a felt tip|`|lO3Ojrgiaa	the 'raccon' look is caused by applying too much(like a raccons eyes look) so when i put mine on i just close one eye and put it on that eye and then do the other one i guess just practice a few times before you accually do need to put it on though
3JkZPMvYaa	yes it does no matter what skin type u are <br>  it really depends i wash my face every morning and it ussually lasts a month or so <br>  . use jolen it doesnt burn your face like the walgreens brand one . also it might itch parts of your face really bad and its goin to burn ur eyes a little bit juss close them and wait about ten minutes|`|hEAdpYHvaa	Bleaching is unnatural, a painful chemical process. If you're talking about upper lip hair, just turn on some music and pluck it. It takes me about 15 minutes to do it, doesn't burn, and it's free!|`|cj0edEvKaa	Depends on where it is! If it's on your upper lip I wouldn't do it! I had a friend that did it and when she stood in the sunlight all you saw were the shiny blond hairs on her upper lip!LOL...not a good look! Just wax or pluck, then you don't have to worry about it for a couple of weeks!

It will come out in big waves- dont brush it tho or it goes all funny.<br>  If you are looking for the sloaney backcombed look, wash it (but no conditioner) then dry it upside down and back comb. Then put some smoothing serum on it. <br>  my main tip would be DONT brush your hair atall!<br>  hope that this helps!|`|kEE7ND0Faa	put smoothing serum in your hair after the shower while soaking wet if you have natural curly/frizzy hair then brush it before the shower cause brushing after separates curls the sleep with a towel wrapped around you head|`|nLF3cmqOaa	thats exactly what i do, or i comb it and sleep with it in a wet messy bun.<br>  <br>  either way DO NOT brush it in the morning. it will look like a poofy ragged tumbleweed|`|kZ9kcd53aa	i would definatley not advise you to sleep with it wet!  just run your fingers through it with loads of conditioner in the shower. scrunch it with yout fingers after, but let it moreorless dry before you sleep. if your scrunch it enough, it'll go curly on the ends, and still be messy. anti frizz serum helps tons too:)
yENww2b0aa	itl hurt a lil,but ul get used to it after a few times.i thread eyebrows for my clients.ive never had a client actually cry or stop the process.but dont get it done if ur feeling panicky cos ul jus work urself up.try havin a shower before u go,ur pores will open resultin in less pain.or ask the beauty therapist to put some soothing gel on before and after the process.to bear the pain make sure u keep ur skin taut at all times. <br>  <br>  hope that helped<br>  btw it is best to get it done from someone who does threading with their hands,not in their mouth.

Make sure you go to someone who is reputable and caring because I've had someone pull a bit of skin off with the hairs. I would rate the pain a 8/10. It's a much different kind of pain because its so close to your eyes. I always tear up and have blurry vision when the esthetician is finished. <br>  <br>  When s/he asks you to hold your eyebrow, make sure you hold it taut which helps reduce the pain. Also, make sure the esthetician rubs some astringent or alcohol over them before s/he threads. Resist the urge to touch your brows until you wash your face and hands.|`|4AXyi5qMaa	Ouch! I did it once and will never ever ever do it again! <br>  For one, its unsanitary im not sure how they do it where your at but i went to the mall and had mine done and they put half the string in there mouth while they use there 2 hands to thread!

OXOHoISraa	You are going to have the same problem with A&D as with Neosporin, except that neosporin tends to give more likelihood of an allergic reaction. The problem is Lanolin.  I would switch to an unscented lotion. I always use Lubriderm.  You don't need to be putting it on heavily either. A thin layer a few times a day just to keep it from getting hard and cracking rather than peeling. <br>  <br>  DO NOT. I repeat DO NOT recover with saran wrap.  It needs to breathe to heal.  <br>  <br>  That being said, don't worry. You probably haven't ruined your tattoo.  Just go ahead and switch to keep the colors vibrant.|`|TjPwxbuJaa	Neosporin won't suck out the ink. Some ink does come out during the healing process but that is only the ink in the very upper surface of the skin anyway.<br>  I use A&D ointment for the first day only. Then I just use a basic lotion like Curell. Nothing more. Obviously, I wash the area thoroughly during my shower as well. I've never had an infection from the tattoos and mine all are largely healed within a week.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	A &D ointment you can find it in the baby aisle.|`|l5OMFTMUaa	oh no!! neosporin is NO good!! i would get some A & D ointment and apply very thin layers on it... tattoo goo also works very well! i wouldnt worry too much but just switch to A & D (you can get it in the baby sections with formulas and stuff for cheap at drugstores) and use that but not over 3 days and after 3 days use non scented, non dyed lotions like lubradurm, good luck, you should be fine tho and if not you can always get touch ups hopefully for free.|`|c720a537294a26363d1792085df262cdaa	a and d ointment works best, but my tattoo guy also believes in any good lotion just don't let it scab over cause that will cause the ink to come out with the scab.  it is supposed to peel, kinda like a sunburn, but it's not supposed to scab, that will cause it to mess up.  allot of people believe that it's supposed to scab, but i've been told that is wrong, and none of my tattoos have scabbed and they are all fine, but my mom had part of one of hers scab and now that area has no color|`|br1FB5rraa	Use a+d ointment for the first 6 days after getting the tattoo. Then switch to using curel ultra healing lotion. I don't know what the tattoo artist was thinking telling you to use neosporin, but that's definatly not what you want to use though|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	A&D ointment|`|1Z0D8Pyoaa	DO NOT use neosporin! it will try to reject foreign substances from your body (ink). You could use A&D or bacitracin zinc ointment. But, they are both petroleum-based, which I don't recommend as they do not let the tattoo breathe well and in turn prolonging healing. Try to get something called "Tattoo Goo" or "Ink Fixx" some tattoo shops sell these aftercare products. If you need something now, go and get some "Lubriderm" skin lotion. Make sure and get some that is dye and fragrance-free.|`|yXUtl0aHaa	try first aid creme, it usually depends, because who is the professional? your artist, who is telling you not to use it? non professionals.|`|OVsVIM6gaa	You could try A&D.  I put that on pretty thick and then saran wrap over it, so it wouldn't rub off on my clothes.  Good luck!  Also, if the tattoo artist recommended neosporin, then it couldn't be THAT bad, right?|`|IS1F69mraa	Aquaphor. Works wonders.|`|wUIJSSJlaa	I dont use A&D or neosporin or vaseline all I use is plain unscented lotion.<br>  <br>  It's never done me wrong.|`|INwEnAENaa	idk but u could always go to ur artist and ask him

This will make your skin soft.<br>  <br>  Olay and johnson & johnson work very well if have sensitive skin.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Get a good facial mosturizer. Here is the link for the one I use.

feb709a513aec267aa2bba64fbb6040eaa	Try dry shampoo, and how can you have a busy schedule at 13? You should at least be able to wash your hair 4 times a day. (You're in puberty, so you're hair is greasy, and if you don't wash it, you're bound to get zits.)|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Don't get a perm if you're black because those chemicals are damaging to the hair and causes the hair to dry out, and if you're not careful then you can actually damage your scalp. I noticed that she didn't say you should get a perm if your white, hmmm. <br>  <br>  Anyway, if you take a shower, I'm assuming you do, then you should wash and condition your hair while you're in the shower and this will make it much easier. Just later on the shampoo for a quick wash and put on the conditioner and let that be the last thing you rinse out before you get out of the shower.|`|YB63U3Pgaa	How busy can you be at 13 that you dont have 3-4 mins in the shower everyday to wash your hair. Or do you mean to dry and style it after you have washed it. If you do then join the club we all have to deal with that, just have to find the time. If your hair is naturally greasy ( and i mean that if you do wash it the next day it's greasy and not cause you haven't washed in in a few days) then you need to use products for greay hair and dont stimulate your scalp too much when you shampoo that should help reduce the greasyness.|`|GxIArumzaa	im not racist but are u white or black!!! u should get a perm if you are black!!!!<br>  if u are white wash ur hair with some dry shampoo from like Walmart or Walgreen's!!! <br>  if black and i get my hair braided every 2 weeks that is also a thing 2 try!!! or u can get kicky twists!!!!<br>  im 12 wow we have soooooo much in common!!!|`|6RrmmDyLaa	If you go extended times without washing your hair, make sure that whenever you do wash your hair that you have a really good shampoo and conditioner.

GcTNNrRSaa	I used to have hair like that picture so ill give you some tips.<br>  Your bangs def. need to be cut cuz their really long. Id say go get a hair but and bring the photo in for the bangs or if your good at cutting hair yourself cut them shorter with fringe, prefferably with a razor. <br>  Use a volumizing shampoo-also you might wanna get more choppy layers.<br>  Tease your hair from underneath(leave a thin top layer unteased) use mousse or hairspray and shape it with your hands.<br>  If your hair isnt straight remember to straighten before hand.<br>  Also, I know you said you didnt want extensions but they really help with this type of hair. Clip in extensions are sallys arent that expensive at all.|`|BHAUXSI3aa	POSERR!!<br>  \<br>  jkjk<br>  <br>  but uhmm get ur shortest layer that u tease and put hairspray volumizer under then near the head to give volume then tease it, seriously and st8en it fa show;)|`|WulzVd1baa	take the picture to a hair dresser and get bangs sorta a muet style then just tease it baby. hairspray and tease thats the scene way|`|vPAftdO7aa	Try volumizer and a blow dryer. Make sections and soak the roots with it and blow dry upside down. Also use a straightening or heat serum to protect your hair when using such heat. Seems like just need some styling products. Use a straightener afterward to deal with randomness the blow dryer will leave you with. <br>  <br>  I have the same problem with my bangs. This is what I would suggest. <br>  When your hair is wet, part your bangs to wear you want them, put some moose on them and blow dry towards the angle you want them to lay with a round brush. <br>  <br>  Talk with a stylist, tell them exactly what you're trying to accomplish, they could help. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|sGRFbAMGaa	You need to cut your bangs if you have any.<br>  They are waaay to long.<br>  And maybe your brush has to do with something.<br>  Cause my hair is thin also and a normal brush wouldn't work for me.<br>  So i used a round brush with lots of coarse bristles and it worked perfectly! try it outt. xoxo
FGSNuP1Uaa	That's not skater, that's irritating. Skater to me is more like wearing beanies, normal sweatshirts, I guess vans (well, they're my favorite), um, baggy-ish jeans( more like flared jeans for girls) Let your hair be messy if it wants to be, don't act TOO girly all the time. Act mellow and mature, but make sure you're still funny and not always serious.<br>  I just basically desribed myself, so yea. LOL.

Or could be you hair drying to close to your hair. <br>  <br>  Move hairdryer further away when drying<br>  or/and<br>  Use heat defence or/and straighten faster :)|`|HWAFJHbwaa	I had 50% of my hair Grey, I stopped using any kind of shampoo and soap, my hair all black now, no grey hair and none falling off also
kUE3Ddktaa	Stretch marks are basically thin scars. One of the best home treatments for scars is Vitamin E. You can buy Vitamin E oil at health food stores, and you can get lotions and body washes with Vitamin E at the grocery store or CVS. Moisturizing the skin every day will help prevent new stretch marks and the vitamin E will help diminish them.<br>  <br>  And I know this is hard, but be patient - stretch marks will fade away to practically nothing in a couple years. I had them on my thighs when I was your age. I'm 25 now and they're basically invisible, especially in the summer when I have a tan.|`|st5reHVjaa	probably because u grew fast.<br>  try prefer-on (from head on) it works!!|`|yi9I2OdFaa	i'm also 17 and have the same problem!

LGidAYDwaa	Your hair dresser should know what a scene hair cut is. I would look on line (you can Google "scene hair" or "scene hairstyles" in Google Images) or at her shop - just go early. Most hair dressers have at least one book of scene hair, and you can always mix and match the traits of one style with another.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	go on google and look up a kind of scene hair you want and then print it out and show your hairdresser =)|`|miME6EPTaa	Find a picture of a scene haircut you like (search through bebo, google you know something like that :P) then show the hairdresser the picture and im sure she can style it like the picture <br>  <br>  Or ask for really short layers and long bangs :)|`|MT1VRgstaa	find a pic u like on google and bring it there and ask to get ur hair cut like that|`|QeALCWbqaa	pics|`|INwEnAENaa	dont cuz theres already to much posers out there we dont need more...|`|4DeahPjfaa	Find a decent picture and bring it in.

154dzJ1Faa	No, changing shampoo does NOT make your hair fall out.  It may make your scalp dry or flaky, but that is because one has more oil in it than does another.  All shampoos are basically made of the same thing.<br>  <br>  You want a plain basic simple shampoo without all the additives which drives up the cost and don't really do anything to help you or your hair.  While everyone will have their favourites, I think you will have good results with Nexxus or Redken or Focus21 products.  They still don't have too much junk in them as do all the others.<br>  <br>  If your hair is clean it will smell good all day and longer.  If not, there is something seriously wrong there.  It should not be getting dry if you use it correctly.  Maybe you are shampooing too often?  And hair falling out is an internal problem and has nothing to do with what happens on the outside of the skin.  We always are losing hair; perhaps you only notice it more at certain times.|`|AA11540024	mine does that too. I switched over to Suave's Professionals (orange or blue bottle) and I have no problems. Makes the hair smell good too.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	you need to be careful when buying shampoo. alot of shampoo companies put wax in their products like suave and pantene for example. when you brush your hair, do you see little white balls that look kind of like fuzz or tiny pieces of dandruff?? well that's the wax! its totally bad for your scalp. if your scalp is white then you should go in for treatment. its not expensive, maybe 25 dollars at the most. but that is why your hair is coming out. it happens to me when i use poor shampoo. i recommend buying PUREOLOGY shampoo and conditioner. its kind of pricey but worth it.<br>  i hope i helped!<br>  <br>  EDIT: the guy above me named some really, really good shampoo's! ALSO if you dont have the money to buy those, they sell organic shampoos at any health stores...go for tea tree oil shampoo...its amazing. and smells really really good.|`|dVEXlaWVaa	you probably need an anti breakage system. Something with B vitamins. I had that problem. Everything I used would make it fall out. Then I switched to Tresemme. Anti breakage shampoo and conditioner. Its works very well. It has B vitamins in it which strengthens your hair. By the smells great all day!|`|32JV6UwKaa	Your hair starts to break out because from the first shampoo you used you should have kept on using it.When you changed shampoos your hair was already used to the first shampoo which result to your hair breaking out.Take it from an person who experienced it.
u0eTvggDaa	well make sure whatever she does it with, that it's clean and new. don't let her pierce it with the same one she did her's with.<br>  <br>  and to keep it from getting infected get the Orange dial soap, it doesn't smell very good, but if you get that and wash it with that. it should be just fine.<br>  <br>  go for it!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i could help!!|`|7ky7l7kwaa	Very bad idea.<br>  <br>  Where is she getting the needle?  Has it been properly sterilized/sanitized?  Not to mention whatever jewel you'd be putting in it.  <br>  If you really want it down, save up and get it done professionally.  <br>  <br>  Also, if it does get infected, it's gonna seep yellow/green pus and you can just imagine what that's gonna look like on your nose.  <br>  <br>  But if you do get it done, clean it three times a day with a saline solution.  That'll help you fight infection too.|`|p2YkMMSvaa	NOOOOOOOOO|`|YGoz8wiZaa	if you want an infection, go ahead,|`|0hdAwwWOaa	lol teens are pros|`|UXfYgI7raa	If you are going to get it done whether your mum likes it or not then I would get it done professionally.<br>  However if you let her then make sure you sterilise everything like the needle and the nose stud and you should be infection free <br>  Also make sure you keep it clean afterwards<br>  Good Luck!|`|gzOKClBPaa	ok assuming since ur a chick u want the side of your nose done right? not the inside like a dude would get? its safe yes im helping people pirece stuff all the time if she has hers done than no problem but if not she might not know what shes doing|`|DNLJwLZqaa	Do you trust her?<br>  <br>  my friends all pierced their ears together and oen of them had their nose pierced and they were fine.<br>  Make sure everything is sterile.

It just damages it.<br>  Ponytails are classic, plus adding clips to the front/side.<br>  Side bangs are cute.<br>  Braids?<br>  Side parting, probably on the right.<br>  Bun?<br>  Your avatar picture looks cute, why not do your hair like that?|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	this would look gorgeous on u|`|hdFSt0xNaa	Yes.

D1vZXuziaa	Yes I found that using this Shampoo by Fruitctis or however that brand is spelled actually worked on mine! I feel like it's getting fuller and longer faster! The Shampoo is called long and strong and I think they have a conditioner that goes along with it.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Once your hair strands begin to turn gray then they stay like that forever. There isn't any natural or manufactured formula that will change it back to it's natural color. Genetics and stress are just two things that can cause graying - and you've pointed out that it's genetic. Just continue to dye it like you've been doing because that's the only thing you can do.|`|YB63U3Pgaa	hunni thats not true, your hair is white because the pigmantation has gone and nothing can bring that back. Dyeing it is your only option, but i would say you are a bit on the young side to be getting white hair, is it in patches clumped together?<br>  <br>  Haha i totally got the wrong end of the stick there. Either way no carrot juice wont help with the colour of your hair ....... but i have heard that it makes you see in the dark!!<br>  <br>  Ah i was right he was talking about going grey. It's very rare but there is a condition that causes you hair to go white in patches ( just cant think of the name...ah even if i could remember i'd never be able to spell it ) <br>  <br>  Yeah if you dad has it then it was always on the books that it could happen to you. They know why your hair goes grey ( no pigmentation ) but they no idea why some people stop producing it and other dont and at different stages in life.|`|lrVbZdSDaa	I believe by white he means that after dying his hair (after bleaching it) his hair is white, but it should grow back as it's natural color.<br>  <br>  And I would dismiss that as a stupid rumor.

They've been helping, but I don't want to curse a good thing, lol. I also use Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizers because my skin gets red (acne medication or not).

OU8gfFVjaa	im the same age and i have acne too only mines pretty easy to cover up. theres not a super fast way that could get ya totally clear by then but i use clean and clear and it helps me. proactive is also amazing along with skinID except with those treatments they only work the first time. they clear you up and then stop working so id suggest switching brands everytime you run out of a bottle. <br>  for on the spot quick fixes, id suggest crushing asprin and mixing it in with water to use as a sccrub bc asprin has cleaning indgredients and helps reduce redness. also an ice cube can be held to the blemish to reduce redness. <br>  <br>  if NOTHING works on your skin id suggest seeing a dermitologist. i saw one and they helped but like i said, you skin becomes sort of immune to one cleanser after a while so id suggest switching it up every few weeks.<br>  also i wouldnt worry too much about your looks, judges usually only care about your voice (i assume you're singing since ur names "soprano")<br>  <br>  hope i helped and good luck with your audition!|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	There aren't any safe home remedies. Try a dermatologist and ask for Benzaclin. That supposedly helps in 2 weeks (I'm not sure if it does, I don't use it, but if what I'm trying out  now doesn't work for me I'm going to a dermatologist).<br>  <br>  Use a gentle cleanser (Cetaphil), toner or astringent (if you wear makeup), oil free moisturizer that is for your skin type (Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, etc), then try a mask once a week (Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque), and exfoliate twice a week (St. Ives)|`|SmNFiTkbaa	Go to your dermatologist and ask them is they think the new SkinID thing will work for you.

Also, don't pop pimples unless it is necesary. Makeup: get cover up that mathces your skin tone (try clinique. they will help find the right shade) and use it on your entire face to blend colors. I also recomend putting lotion on before makeup as well. good luck!|`|9mNkoiHgaa	CALL A DERMATOLOGIST RIGHT NOW!! do not procrastinate or you will not get the treatment you want fast enough!<br>  <br>  Tell her/him that you want it to go away as fast as possible...and to put you on oral medication and get some gel or cream to put on your face at night.

kknSPYxKaa	It all depends on what you are looking for.<br>  I have both of the pallettes and they are both really great.<br>  The first one I bought was the shimmer one because they were out of stock of the matte one.  So I was stuck with the shimmer.<br>  I bought it and I loved it!  It is really shimmer, but not too much where it looks like you just laid on the glitter.<br>  It is really pigmented and it looks really good, and it doesn't crease, none whatsoever.<br>  I next bought the matte pallette and it is great too, but I prefere the shimmer one because it seems a little less old for me.<br>  The matte one isn't for teenagers.|`|dqdlbJMhaa	I have both Matte and the Shimmer... I wished I just bought the matte and saved my money.. The shimmer was way to much for ME....if your looking for the disco ball look .. get the all shimmer one..<br>  <br>  However...

tB5pveZXaa	Firstly, I am a real New Yorker, thought I'd put that out there<br>  <br>  Now to your question, although the snow came down in massive quantities, it's gone now (or at least it's only a little bit at the sides of sidewalks). However, the fact that it's gone doesn't mean its not cold. I wore flats today, and let me tell you, not a pleasant experience. It felt like each of my toes were icicles. So my advice to you is that you only wear them if you're not walking anywhere, and no you won't look high-maintenance.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	u can def. wear heels in NYC...i mean seriously, in NYC you can find so many diverse styles and craziness....heels are actually very tamed within this crowd. plus i think heels are essential- they make you like taller, slimmer, and have a straighter back plus good calves is a plus as well....plus if you get the dr. sholl's for her heel padding they are so comfy!|`|dPiveaqgaa	Most people in New York wouldn't think your high maintenance, but more that you're a brave soul because you are walking in New York City with heels.|`|fe37gfRvaa	sure why not, i live in MÃ©xico city though.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	whats wrong with tomorrow<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: i know it snowed, im in the city.but i wore heels today...its just snow

But it would also look good if you wore black make up or brown. <br>  <br>  When I say black, I don't mean emo or goth. I mean eyeliner, grayish makeup with shades of white.

I wear thick black eyeliner only under my eyes, and thats it. If you have pale skin, this makes for a very big contrast. Other than that, I would wear black mascara, (I have also tried this and it works) and Green eyeshadow (looks very pretty with brown eyes) You could also try and buy some color contactsin a color like blue or green, your eyes would stand out, however htey wouldn't be brown anymore. Green looks most unique on brunettes.|`|YhZM84P1aa	the color green brings out brown eyes more.  you can try something with that.

Try a pretty brown or gray to give you the smokey eye look if you prefer not to wear eyeshadow and always remember to smudge it. Cover girl sells eye liner with the white smudge on the other end, this works great. This opens your eyes and gives it a dramatic look. Try a voluming mascara and curl your lashes after applying 2 coats on top and on bottom.<br>  If you decide to try eyeshadow, pretty purples make brown eyes stand out and look pretty!!!|`|uinjnAsaaa	i was@ sephora the other day and this lady sed that people w/ light skin and hair hv to wear brown eyeliner and mascara but people w/ black hair and dark eyes and skin colr can wear darker mascara and eyeliner(black)|`|I12nj0M7aa	I have the exact same features as you.

Pretty much the dark of any colors.|`|mbDp1IHuaa	(: usualy depends.<br>  like if they are tan then redddd (: <br>  but normaly like others said - darker colors.<br>  midnight blue, gray, brown, black etc..|`|TudZYPN5aa	plaid tye dye with pumpkins on it|`|qcpVR7vGaa	it depends on the their tan.  i personally like burgundy, navy blue, black(with a graphic), shirts with designs on them, dress shirts with a tee underneath|`|TuBzc1R5aa	bright summer colors. =)|`|u5c8eS9gaa	It really depends on the guy because some colors will flatter one person better then it will flatter someone else. BUT you can never go wrong with a black tee, with or with out graphic, and most shades of blue also tend to look good on most guys.|`|lgi0SQzDaa	I like kind of bright colored or graphic, striped tees.|`|YZNZAnIraa	It takes a real man to wear pink :)<br>  <br>  and black and white and navy|`|vOJGXmKdaa	Black or any dark color.|`|EzY40I8Eaa	black!<br>  :)<br>  too much color is femmmmmmmm|`|3I7pKdPlaa	white or black:)|`|TwXJS1thaa	black :)|`|Z2pmfQREaa	all the colours are great ecxept pink i really get mad when i see a guy wearing pink and glitters eww<br>  but the best is black and dark blue they r my fav and my love always wear them any way hope i helped|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Black or dark colors.

PKRZtwyHaa	do not get one|`|5M0FBU89aa	The typical size (about 4" diameter?) is not that painful.<br>  It's like getting scratched by a cat -- for about 4 hours.<br>  <br>  I've known some people who get large pieces (in one sitting) to take a Vicodon beforehand.<br>  <br>  Depends on where you get it too.  If it's over a bone, it will swell and hurt more.   On a fleshy part, not so much.<br>  <br>  Get it done at a reputable place. <br>  <br>  PS- The more detail it has, the more chances there are of it looking really blotchy as you get older.  Simple outlines with color (or Tribal/Celtic) seems to look best longest without touchup (Like Ed Hardy clothing designs).<br>  <br>  There's lots of FAQ's on the Net about getting tats - do all your research before hopping into the chair.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	It depends what you're scared about...<br>  <br>  If it's the pain, then go for it, it won't be as bad as you think, and even so - it's only temporary, and well worth the permanent outcome.<br>  <br>  If you're scared about regretting it at all then I would say hold off until you can be certain. The pain will be over very quickly, but any regrets would be with you for a lifetime.|`|TjPwxbuJaa	Are you scared about the actually process of getting it or of the permanency of it? If it is about the pain of getting it, it's really not that bad. I've had about 70 hours of tattooing so far (both arms, shoulders, upper back, chest, part of neck) and am still getting more every month. The pain is noticeable for the first couple of minutes of the session, but then is barely noticeable.<br>  Now, if you are scared about the permanency of them, just don't get a tattoo. You have to be confident about what you want and why you want it. Otherwise, there's a good chance you will regret it.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	I always suggest that if you want a tattoo, choose a design that has personal meaning and then put it up on your bathroom mirror.  If you can look at it every day for a year, then and only then, should you consider putting it on your body permanently.<br>  <br>  I have done this with all of my tattoos.  I can't tell you how many designs have wound up in the trash.  So thankful they aren't on my body.  And the one's I have gotten I have loved for years.  <br>  <br>  And yes, it hurts.  Some areas more than others but it's not that bad.|`|uuHDQr1paa	Tattoos make you look "trashy".  Forget the tattoo.  They are not even original anymore because everyone has one.|`|AA10962298	It only stings for a few minutes and then gets numb. It's not all that bad.|`|2daebb3597a4356f1b883fea4d41414eaa	I got one because my friend talked me into it.  I was young and dumb.  Unless its something you really want and have wanted one for a long time, despite what others try to get you to do, don't get one.  I wish I didnt have mine because now I have a child I will have to explain it to and I dont want her to get one.|`|bu2BPue7aa	I have 6 tattoos, I love all of them and don't regret any.  The pain isn't all that bad but its not painless.  Take a sharp toothpick and stick your arm really fast, it kinda feels like that.  They are so worth the pain, but be careful because they are addicting.|`|s4q8M2fAaa	don't get one unless you are sure. i have quite a few. the pain depends on where on your body you get it. some areas are more sensitive than others. to me my ribs, feet, and underarm were the most painful, but not unbearable. well worth it|`|ANsznbWsaa	Everyone is a little scared at first, but it's really not that bad at all.<br>  Take a needle and drag it on you skin with a little pressure.... that's pretty much what it feels like. Not so much pain as it is annoying.|`|N6frEVbiaa	no pain no gain! lol|`|Tm9kA5umaa	yah it hurt but like they say it lasts forever and i love it|`|JRRsjByCaa	so, what is your question?|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	Depending on where you get a tattoo will determine how much it hurts. Fleshy areas don't hurt as bad as say bony areas. Also, it depends on your tolerance to pain too.  Start small if you're not good with pain. If it's not so bad you can always get something larger or expand on the smaller one. Good luck to you.|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	Remember tattoos are forever and they might be cool now, but when you get older you're going to look at them differently and wish you never got them. Take it from me I thought the same thing and now I wish I could get them removed, but that's too expensive, so I am stuck with them for life.|`|8FrUhGsNaa	if you really want one.. it doesn't hurt too terribly bad once you get used to it.<br>  <br>  but if your just nervous to get one don't. you may regret it... or get it somewhere that could be covered easily.|`|1Onob98Laa	hey! i have a lil tat that i just got recently... its really NOT THAT bad, and thats because im a big wimp... if you want it then just sit there and take it.. but i dont recommend getting a huuge tat ur first try...|`|43k2ISydaa	its kool. of course it is going to hurt. but only for a sec. next thing you know your done. you will eventually get used to it|`|OXOHoISraa	It only hurts once. It is on you forever. You won't die from it if you go to a clean, reputable shop. I am all for it, but i like tattoos|`|1fc3673510203595378a0fcae2d7735baa	It will hurt a bit or a lot at first depending on where you get it but after a little while the pain disappears.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	dont be. once the needle hits for the first time, it doesnt hurt at all. its jsut all adrenaline and excitement.|`|ANl54Xowaa	I think tatoos dont hurt that much. If its in a sensitive spot, yeah. Dont let alittle pain stop you though.|`|7f46788f4d37d25a8417845968c3e9a2aa	If you don't know what to get don't get one.    It should be meningful
D1vZXuziaa	Well I would definately say yes to the other side of your lip as for the septum... well I guess you really wouldn't know until you tried it! : ) If you don't like it you could always remove it! Right!?|`|5zZcf8Kpaa	no septum is too much.  you look good with just those, maybe the other side of your lip... but even that would be pushing it.|`|rEWVy1Sraa	I think you would look awesome with your septum pierced.  You should also get the other side of your lip pierced ( snake bites) it would look great on you. hope this helps|`|igAzUW8saa	the septum piercing is over the top, a little too much, love the hair, :)|`|jNw8AUzUaa	ahhh i love your hair and eyes!<br>  *coughs* err..anyways. im gonna have to say no. its a bit too much. stick with another lip piercing.|`|zanfEbhTaa	EW I HATE SEPTUMSSS wth|`|vYlia8bjaa	i have a similar nose shape as you, and i had septum and it didnt look too good.<br>  <br>  so no i dont think you should get it.|`|b3f57373a0112a4463000fda7f1e950baa	No, I'd say not. The piercings you have right now suit your style and I think your face isn't right for a harsher-looking septum piercing.
iWmU3fSWaa	try some different things: do your makeup totally out of the ordinary, cut your hair or put in a bunch of layers :]<br>  get a manicure or pedicure! :] (those make me feel good)|`|JXTPydxJaa	You're extremely pretty you should already feel comfortable in your skin. I'd never recommend a complete makeover, it usually looks kind of fake and poser-ish. Just try to dress to who are, mix and match and find your own style, it may take some time|`|9FBh8Mu0aa	Get a hair cut.<br>  Change your eye makeup.<br>  Change the way you dress.<br>  Do something totally different from your regular routine.|`|Ow1JDOT2aa	By looking at your pictures you put up,in my opinion, you are perfectly fine.<br>  You are at a good size and height.<br>  I think you shouldn't feel so down about yourself.<br>  There's no need to.|`|GRT9Ch4Maa	WOW!

Because I couldn't date a guy that looked like a horses *** just because he's nice. <br>  <br>  I'd take the good looks an arrogance but only for a short amount of time.

3Z4YFz29aa	if you use hot water it is<br>  <br>  wash in warm<br>  rinse in cold|`|utZyz90Waa	Your hair has natural oils in it, which is why if you left it for weeks on end it wouldn't look greasy, because your hair pretty much can take care of itself. If you wash it too much then you're actually washing out these natural oils and it will make your hair quite brittle and dry, or if you wash it insane too much it will go really greasy and limp. The best way to go is to wash it in the morning, leave it the next day, then wash it the next morning. This pretty much ensures you two days of healthy hair before it gets greasy or horrible!|`|jdcexBKfaa	Yes, it will become too much for your hair, and that oil stuff on your scalp is actually healthy for your hair and your head needs that oil, and washing it out all the time will not help your hair look shinier and healthier.|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Yes, it is bad for your hair. It might seem nice at first, but it strips the natural oils from your hair, leading to early hair loss. I'd suggest every two - three days.<br>  <br>  Cheers, <br>  - Claire|`|KLz2Q3K3aa	well, it dries out your hair when you wash it too much.|`|W9WLPtlYaa	yeah...it dries your hair out, so your scalp doesnt have enough natural oils, so your body makes up for it by producing even more oils, which can lead to acne|`|RDL1kBtZaa	It really dries out your hair.  Wash it every second day.|`|RILCsJGlaa	Yes.<br>  You should wash your hair 2 times in a week.<br>  If you wash your hair every day it will get weak and it won't grow the way it should.
d8EYaNw2aa	you can contact Chanel and they can maybe try and send you a button!
2gstVBcMaa	what?? just because your parents have been married for 14 years mean they they are not supposed to care what they smell like?  <br>  <br>  You mom obviously likes it when your dad smells good...i think that is sweet!|`|7DJkwzKDaa	No my dad does too :]|`|yo0qnedIaa	No. Whats wrong with smelling good?|`|oAkGBiobaa	nah, my dad does as well,<br>  mostly when going on dates tho.<br>  u hav to remember that dads are just guys grown up:)|`|rGci1ehoaa	No.. it isnt weird... why do your friends think your dad is cheating because he wears cologne?? Some people just like to smell good. my husband has alot of cologne... as long as your dad isnt putting on cologne to go "grocery shopping" then its fine lol|`|TTgqu8i9aa	No not at all. My married uncle does and none of  my friends think thats weird so definetly no. My daddy wears deoderant which is just like cologne. Why would your friends be suprised. Haven't they ever gone out?|`|m7NEFMJJaa	no, just because he's tied down into marriage doesnt mean he has to stop dressign and smelling nice. Or maybe he's cheating on your mother?|`|oER5KtH2aa	no most everyone's dad wears it mine dose he has the right to smell like any other guy|`|cyG013twaa	Why would it be weird? It's like your mom wearing perfume.

It can't be too odd to you either as he is on his second bottle at the very least!|`|oYF3nIbsaa	Um no, most men do. Sometimes its aftershave or just their deoderant. But Tommy Hilfiger is a little weird. Most men where AXE or something like that. my daddy does!
MrizzMDhaa	It really depends on the cut of each individual bra as well and what look you like or feel comfortable with. I'm a 34F but will sometimes buy a 36E or a 34E. Normally if you go up a back size you reduce the cup size by one (because it is about the differential between them) but I will even try on 32 Gs and 34 Gs and 36Fs. Try on around the size and have a fitting assistant help .<br>  Recently in Marks and Spensers though the fitting assistant was insistent that I took a bra in a particular size (34G) but I preferred it in the 34F because it gave a more firm and round look. So choice comes in to it too. If a new bra already feels too comfortable it is probably a wee bit too big - you should buy it to fit the middle hook.<br>  The only way to know is to try it on - and I know that is a pain if you need to get mail order.
ae5e3899eec0749d15858493b9ff0876aa	mmhhhmm!<br>  super attractive =)|`|CrhV6u6yaa	yessss.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Yes VERY!!!!!|`|1o3OqSioaa	That depends upon the guy! An outdoorsey masculine type of  guy with a little facial hair (scrubby) would look awesome. <br>  A little nerdy guy with a pen pocket buddy not so much, it would just be awkwardddddd!!!!|`|6dGt9xlUaa	yes! especially when you roll the sleeves up a little and wear a good smelling cologne!<3
5qIOzchwaa	i'd like to do pink and turquoise but doubt my job will let me lol.|`|QW4jdXGjaa	I have black hair, so it's hard to dye that another color. I wouldn't want to do all of that. But my friend told me to dye my hair black, get black highlights, and dye the ends of my hair purple. I'm not going to do that since it would be a waste of money.|`|1TX8wwB8aa	im bout to dye mine my dream color red but any red ...cherry red like the color of an actual cherry|`|owTQfAmnaa	i would die mine darker and thinking about putting a purple streak in it
zcwLJVZgaa	Ohh I'm sorry :( <br>  You gotta practice, start with shorter thicker heels!<br>  Shoulders back, chin up, short steps, heels first.<br>  :]]|`|bed4c33bdb3017e1a505b0d8611e0264aa	I can now. I started with shorter ones and worked my way up. It just takes practice.  It's so worth it though :)|`|WFItVntAaa	lol im a natural but dont worry its best too just not wear heels !!!<br>  the hurt ur feet|`|6GJumHfgaa	Practice. Start with low heels, and work your way up. And try to walk as if you have an orange between your thighs, and you dont want it to fall :)
tFoSy2YRaa	Wear really good bras, make sure they are firm and supportive from underneath your boobs - go on figleaves and have a look at reviews.<br>  Wear plain tops, no ruffles etc around your chest. Wear bootcut jeans with heels or skirts that flare out slightly. Do not wear high necked tops with short sleeves. Usually a fairly low neckline actually makes breasts look smaller. Cropped cardigans over vest tops are good.|`|rpPT4x5Baa	yeah I'm 5'4 and I have c's. i hate them. what I do is wear baggy clothes and i don't wear shirts that expose my chest.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Here is a site that explains how to lose the big boobs =)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/workout-questions-reduce-breast-size.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shapefit.com/workout-question...</a> This site provides exercises on how to make your boobs smaller.<br>  <br>  You also can get a bra that reduces your boobs.

Just wear loose shirts so they appear smaller I guess.|`|YMKAgH4Paa	Sometimes if you wear <br>  Your normal bra<br>  Several sports bras<br>  &; a camisole<br>  they look smaller.

ti8JXNz6aa	I think tattoos are a lot classier and higher respected then stretched ears.<br>  Tattoos can be considered as art and are becoming more widely accepted especially if it is a well done tattoo and isn't too big, stretched ears is just gross in my opinion (no offense tho i dont judge, i have friends who have it)<br>  I don't think you shuld get it on your wrist because you can't cover it and it could just look like a "eff you" to your manager.<br>  I suggest getting it where it's more hidden but if you really dont care just get it. No matter what get something that is well done and classy especially if it's in a place your manager will see because it makes a difference. The manager might not mind.|`|KF5pitm8aa	As long as it does not say, "No visible tattoos" in the dress code (ask for an employee manual if you are not sure), they cannot fire you for having a visible tattoo.<br>  <br>  However, if they already do not like you, they might find a bogus reason to fire you after you got the tattoo.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Tattoos are allowed, but not certain kinds of jewelery? That sounds very silly. <br>  Anyway, since some of your "uppers" have tats, ask them (since they will prob be more lenient towards them) if it would be acceptable for you to have a visible tattoo. If they say no, (they will have to fire themselves, haha) point out that there is nothing in the handbook that says that. Do NOT say, "But you have one!". That is childish, even though it is obviously true. If they still say no, just say okay.<br>  They are management, so unfortunately, they can bend the rules a bit. <br>  <br>  I know how you feel. Facial piercings are "not allowed" at our company, but my district manager has her nose pierced. Typical!|`|aIFfOrFSaa	if you want a tattoo you should get one, it shouldn't be up to your management to tell you. it's your body you should do what you like :)<br>  & if tattoo's are allowed then you shouldn't have that much of a problem as it's not like they are going to sack you..|`|TcokFzjZaa	i think you should ask them don't go behind their back because then it makes you look conniving and that's not a good thing. but don't not get it because you think they wont let you. just ask whats the worst that could happen they say no and you don't get it....|`|8HRsrkcNaa	its not "trashy to me"<br>  ha, but as long as the contract or whatever doesnt say "no visible tattoos" theres nothing that can be done.
WCu2skI5aa	The Truth About Hair Loss<br>  <br>  It is normal to shed hair every day and the truth is we loose between 100-125 hairs on any given day. Hair that is shed falls out at the end of growth cycle. At any given time 10% of our hair is in what is called a âresting phaseâ and after 2-3 months resting, hair falls out and new hair grows in its place. Some people, however, experience more hair loss than is normal.<br>  <br>  As we get older, both men and women experience some hair loss. Itâs a normal part of the aging process. Called Androgenetic Alopecia, it accounts for 95% of all hair loss. Androgentic Alopecia often runs in families and affects some people more than others. In men it is often referred to as Male Pattern Baldness. <br>  <br>  It is characterized by a receding hair line and baldness on the top of head. Women, on the other hand, donât go entirely bald even if their hair loss is severe. Instead, hair loss is spread out evenly over their entire scalp.<br>  <br>  Hormones play the dominant role when talking about Androgenetic Alopecia. Simple put, both men and women produce testosterone. Testosterone can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with the aid of the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. DHT shrinks hair follicles causing the membranes in the scalp to thicken, become inelastic and restrict blood flow. This causes the hair follicles to atrophy. As a result, when a hair does fall out, it is not replaced.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, men produce more testosterone than women and experience more hair loss.<br>  <br>  While Androgenetic Alopecia is the number one reason why individuals experience hair loss, it is not the only one. Medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, ringworm and fungal infections can cause hair loss. Certain medications such as blood thinners, gout medication, birth control pills and too much vitamin A can cause sudden or abnormal hair loss as can following a crash diet, sudden hormonal changes, chemotherapy and radiation.<br>  <br>  Emotional stress, pregnancy, or surgery can also cause our hair to fall out and is usually not noticed until 3-4 months after the stressful event has taken place. Stress can cause a slowing of new hair growth because a larger number of hair follicles enter into the resting phase and no new hair growth is experienced.<br>  <br>  Another way in which individuals experience hair loss is due to mechanical stressors on the hair and scalp. Wearing pigtails, cornrows or tight rollers that end up pulling on the hair can scar the scalp and cause permanent hair loss. Hair products such as hot oil treatments and chemicals used for permanents can cause inflammation to the hair follicles which can also result in scarring and hair loss.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hey there, I'm just trying to help people find ways to help combat hair <br>  loss, because I used to be suffering from it. hope this helps!|`|uXFdeKGPaa	its the worlds worst nightmare i should know but i tried this and it worked and its free trial.|`|xNUxLnvJaa	My dad had been suffering from hair loss and only recently he started to see a huge difference with his hair (lots of fine hair growing out especially at the temple area) after trying out the various natural techniques taught to grow hair for 1 week at this website <a href="http://www.regrowmyhair.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.regrowmyhair.info</a> <br>  <br>  I must say its a very informative, effective and easy to follow step-by-step guide.

AfnOU04paa	I've tried just about every wax available.  My favorite is L'Orbette.  It can be purchased at large beauty supply stores.  It is good for many areas including "that area", however, I have found it easier and less painful to have the bikini area  done at a salon.  I just wasn't able to get  good leverage on the cotton strip to pull it fast enough or at the proper angle.  It hurt like the devil and most of it stuck to my skin and I got a burning rash.  <br>  <br>  This product can be used in a heating element like they use at the salon, or you can heat it in the microwave.  Spread it on with a popsicle stick just enough to cover the hair; any thicker it's hard to pull off. Try experimenting on your lower arm before you go the whole nine yards.  Use mineral oil to remove any excess on the skin or counter top.|`|sG514Ic9aa	i would just get some nair and go with that.<br>  or for the safer route, go to get it waxed with hot wax.<br>  ask them before hand to put a cold towel over "it" before hand because it will make it numb and not hurt as much. <br>  [:<br>  <br>  happy waxing.

kknSPYxKaa	No Hair Treatment was will not make your hair grow faster but you could try what I have listed below :D<br>  <br>  To make your hair grow faster, I use Mane N' Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.<br>  You can buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply or most CVS's for about 5 or 6 dollars a bottle, depending on where you buy it at.<br>  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and my hair has already grown around 2 inches.<br>  It is horse shampoo, but it can be used on humans too. So no worries there. It makes your hair thicker, shinier, softer, more manageable, and best of all, it makes your hair grow faster.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS:<br>  Flip your hair over at least 3 times a day, to get the blood flowing.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water.<br>  <br>  Get regular trims.(every 6-8 weeks)<br>  <br>  Try to keep heat away from your hair, if you can't use a heat protector.<br>  <br>  Massage your scalp for 2-3 minutes each day.<br>  <br>  Prenatal pills are good for your skin hair and nails! When I took them my hair and nails grew like a weeds!<br>  <br>  hope I helped :D

OXOHoISraa	You can always tell. The skin will not tan the same as the rest of your skin from them on out. I REALLY only think laser tattoo removal is great if you are trying to lighten a current tattoo for a cover-up.  Unfortunately, the laser technology is just not there yet for a perfect removal. Tattoos are permanent and a decision that can stick with you for life. I have seen numerous removals that have not been covered up. The skin always looks a little "off" where the tattoo was.<br>  <br>  Good news for the future?  Freedom-2 LLC has a new ink that can be removed with one pass of the lazer. Bad news?   It is expensive and a lot of people have allergic reactions. Don't expect to see it in most shops soon. Tattooers generally know what ink they like.<br>  <br>  More bad news? The old ink is not as easy to remove. Wrecking balm is also good for lightening but will not fully remove.

ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Try a gentle paste of baking soda and water.

Pif02cN5aa	if you don't moisturize first, it will look cake-y and very obvious that you are wearing concealer, so you want to moisturize the area, if not your whole face, and let that sink in for a few minutes. then you want to dab a little concealer a few times on and around the pimple. just a tiny bit. i dont know what kind of concealer you have, so if it has an applicator brush use that, or use your ring finger, because that is the most gentle and applies the less pressure, NOT your pinky. well, then you will use your finger to blend it in. don't rub the concealer in, but just kind of dab it so that the little dots of concealer you applied are blended well and you may need to apply a little more if it isn't fully concealed. good luck!|`|JjbragXNaa	Best this is to not put anything on it.  But if you must, try rubbing in some lotion on that pimple really well and the apply the concealer.|`|FxkbbOj4aa	Try putting moisturiser on the pimple first, then concealer. It gets rid of the dryness around the pimple so it goes smooth for the concealer.

wycisonaaa	There's probably not much you can do for drastic changes here are my tips for helping it grow:<br>  <br>  * Hair needs nutrients, just like your body so take a couple multivitamins. Or just nutritious fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  * Bend over and brush your hair every night-50-100 strokes. This increases circulation/oxygen to the hair follicles.<br>  <br>  * Thickening shampoo is good for your hair.<br>  <br>  * Drink plenty of water, again sending moisture to your hair and the rest of the body.|`|Zu7GJeU4aa	LOL Hang upside down?|`|kknSPYxKaa	For anyone that says to to use olive oil in your hair, don't do it.<br>  I used it a long time ago and it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life!<br>  I practically had to live in the shower when I used it, it was so greasy afterward, and there was no way to get the olive oil out.<br>  It was like, I really don't know how to explain it, but it was gross.<br>  If you don't believe me, get a little bit of olive oil and try it on a small portion of your hair, it will feel like your just soaking your hair in it, and it will be hard to get out.<br>  <br>  To make your hair grow faster, I use Mane N' Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.<br>  You can buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply or most CVS's for about 5 or 6 dollars a bottle, depending on where you buy it at.<br>  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and my hair has already grown around 2 inches.<br>  It is horse shampoo, but it can be used on humans too. So no worries there. It makes your hair thicker, shinier, softer, more manageable, and best of all, it makes your hair grow faster.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS:<br>  -Flip your hair over at least 3 times a day, to get the blood flowing.<br>  -Drink plenty of water.<br>  -Get regular trims.(every 6-8 weeks)<br>  -Try to keep heat away from your hair, if you can't use a heat protector.<br>  -Massage your scalp for 2-3 minutes each day.<br>  -Prenatal pills are good for your skin hair and nails! When I took them my hair and nails grew like a weeds!<br>  <br>  hope I helped :D|`|TRrTunqvaa	ok if youre serious, check out this supplement BUT read ALL of the reviews (as some people LOVE it, and some people have had more problems than benefits)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P2884&categoryId=C156&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  im sure its safe.. but one review gives the reasons of its affects. it is costly, but hey, some people swear by it. and there might be some other supplements on there you can look at, im not sure. but make sure you read reviews. <br>  <br>  also, something that will work much much slower- scalp massages that stimulate your hair folicles. just have a lover run his hands through your hair and massage your scalp, and its supposed to help! it also feels good if you have a headache! i hope i can help!|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Prenatal vitamins are essential for hair growth.

gsxdwkGVaa	Hair:  I would go with waves.  My sister has very thin hair too.  Check with a friend and see if they have a straight iron with a wave attatchment.  You could also straighten it and add a headband or clip.<br>  <br>  Makeup:  Smoky around the eyes would look great.  I would leave the lips with nothin or thin clear gloss.  Also, don't put too much blush.  Stress the eyeliner thought, and use gray and black eyeshadow.  Don't overdo it though.<br>  <br>  Accessories:  I would find some sort of chunky black jewelry for the bracelet and necklace.  Stay away from diamonds, they clash with black if it's mixed with another color.  I would do the nails black, silver, or clear.  Definately stay away from red.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

AA10700596	i had the same problem people always told me im pretty but i never think so at all.  what i did was whenever someone complimented me i smiled and thanked them meaningfully. and also i read seventeen magazine all the time and once there was an article about self confidence. there was a suggestion- to always focus on the positives. i actually did this and it really did work i feel much better about my self now. what i did was i would mentally list the things that i liked about myself- hair, skin, anything. and when you cant think of any physical traits that you like about yourself, you focus on your talents and things you do well. also compliment yourself on those things. this might sound stupid but i did it and im so happy i read that article cus it really does work.   hope this helps good luck  =]|`|0XdkbEtFaa	hi god i get you i find myself some days thinking i look so plain even though really i know im not and people tell me im handsome well have im a guy btw but it just annoys me alot and yeh confidence aswell it all relates to the same thing learning to accept and love yourself and not judge yourself and not obses keep a bit of distance from vanity from its a strong time grasping evil thing really but yet its there but dont obsese over it just look in the mirror and think i look how i look i know im pretty and nothings going to change so just accept that and then try not to look again and dont let anythign that happens penetrate the confidence you have keep it strong good luck hope this helps :)|`|AZM4H5vUaa	Find small things that you like about yourself.<br>  I used to be like you , people would always tell me that i'm beautiful but i thought they were crazy. I used to avoid looking in mirrors because i was scared of what i would see. Just recently I've made some major changes, everyday when i wake up i ask myself "Am i going to love myself today?" and the answer is usually yes. Then i find a trait that i like about myself and ponder upon it through out the day. Since i started doing this i'm actually able to look at myself in the mirror; smile and say "Wow I'm beautiful and i love myself" . I'm sure you're very beautiful too and i hope one day that you realize your beauty and love yourself completely because it's a great place to be. <br>  Namaste.
85gJHDbNaa	Because guys care about looks. Primal instincts tell us that the most attractive and fertile woman (represented by large breasts and nice, childbearing hips) will attract the strongest men. Naturally, we may want to look good so we can attract the best mate and spread our genes.|`|Pswqhimoaa	Men care more about looks. they're visual.. which means girls need to look better to get a guy....[its in their minds]|`|NIHXUmN1aa	they also care about grammar...lol|`|UM9LlPWDaa	Because it is a proven fact that a man will look toward a girl that is pretty, young and healthy because their biological response to life is to successfully mate.

There are some AH-MAZING hairstyles you can do with naturally wavy ( would know, b/c I have the same problem :)).

vVka4ZA0aa	With both of my tattoos, the artist recommended A & D ointment. I bought the greasier kind, but it worked just fine. My tattoos didn't fade or anything stupid like that, either.<br>  Also, all of my friends who have tattoos used A & D ointment as well and it worked just fine for them. <br>  Just giving you more of an example since skin types are different. But what's nice is that this stuff is ultra sensitive, which is why tattoo artists sometimes suggest it.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	I used Luberderm lotion (unscented).  My tattooist said why use A & D?  It is not infected so don't treat it for an infection.|`|kCdISEGqaa	I always give my clients a can of Tattoo Goo when I am finished, and tell them to use it for the first four days.  After that, I recommend Aveeno Baby lotion to keep it moist while it heals.  It's very mild.  Ointment, not Vaseline or Neosporin, is best for a new tattoo.|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	ointments are always better for new tattoos,they provide more protection as they are usually of an oily base, you can buy it where you like,not necessarily from the studio.don't be tight on something like this,after care is very important|`|f7GPOxooaa	I would ask them.<br>  but then again every artist has different opinions.<br>  I recommend ointment as it is better before bathing because it helps a bit to keep water out as cream would not help at all... i think cream is best for after the 6 weeks..|`|zYVCJRMXaa	ontiment is best but thats fine too, though after about 3 days you should switch over to Lubriderm non scented lotion.

You can get a big jar at the dollar store for a buck and it last forever. Just take an empty pill bottle and fill it with the jelly and put it in your purse,etc. the more often you use it the better.

LRJmHA7vaa	No it won't hurt to change shampoos, but, it doesn't help either. But understand that your hair does not get used to shampoos or conditioners. All your doing by changing is changing the type of build up that is on it. For best results, use a detoxifying shampoo once a month or more if you use alot of product.|`|PW5H6wO3aa	yes, you should change it up once a month, go from herbal essences to pantene the try bumble and bumble then maybe bed head, then you can go back to herbal essences. but definitely be experimental with your hair or the shampoo and condition will not work anymore because you hair is use to it.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I cant imagine that it would. They're all basically the same thing.

MDpydGPeaa	Buy it in your correct size.<br>  <br>  It is a fashion corset, looks like a corset with a lace up back, but the construction is light; it is not a real corset and thus is not designed to cinch you in. If you pull the laces too tight it will wreck or damage the corset. As such it will not give you a great deal of support and not pull your waist in.<br>  <br>  Real corsets are sized by by the waist only, with these you buy one that is 4 inches or 10cm smaller than your normal waist; with fashion corsets you always buy your normal size.<br>  <br>  With practice you will be able to lace it by yourself. If you have any other questions drop me an email|`|AA10034285	It would do no harm to get one or two sizes smaller. As your posture improves and your waistline becomes narrower you will find that a corset becomes much more comfortable and easier to wear.<br>  <br>  It is a pity that more young ladies do not follow your example. It would do wonders for the elegance and poise of the young women of today.|`|tZtlINbxaa	Not a modern corset.  Buy it in your bra size (clothing size?), and prepare to have someone on hand to strap you into it, since you will be physically unable to do it yourself unless it hooks up the front.|`|CMsceWkUaa	hmm.. i would go for your size. it looks like an underwear corset more than a proper corset so go for the size 16-18.|`|0tslWNw4aa	Pick the smallest size that will still let you breath enough to not pass out.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXL|`|pRn1h2Hlaa	go for a size smaller so you can still tie it comfortably and you can also gradually get tighter and tighter.

AA11333546	Urban dictonary it.<br>  I cant give you a EXACT definition, and i dont care if it sounds stupid, or like im labeling myself, but im what most people would consider "hipster"<br>  Its really kind of like indie, but more up with all the trends.

LYdxypciaa	If your a teenager, don't worry it will pass!<br>  I was like that for a while- i didn't smell just sweated a lot.<br>  There is a special type of deodorant that you can get on prescription so ask your GP.<br>  Where lots of sweet smelling perfume and if you have sweat patches don't were tight clothes.<br>  <br>  It'll only last a few months hopefully, good luck x <br>  <br>  also a trick to test for smelly breath lick your wrist, wait till it dries then smell it and that's what your breath smells like ;)|`|of049X1waa	Just always stay clean... use deoderant or anti-perspirant, and put more on every few hours.  Shower every day and wear clean clothes.  Use a nice perfume or body spray and refresh that throughout the day, too.  You probably notice your smells more than other people do,.|`|J4cSgIreaa	yes, i believe it has already been said, use an anti-perspirant deodorant instead of a perfumed body spray as body spray often cloggs the pores and makes u smell more as it masks the smell rather than prevents it.<br>  <br>  If i know i will be doing something to cause me to sweat such as the gym or aerobics class, i use a roll on ball, allow it to dry and the use an anti perspirant over the top.<br>  <br>  As for smelling good use a scented body lotion and rub all over your skin and if u want to smell extra sweet, when using perfume do not rub wrists together, allow it to dry into your skin naturally. Try a little squirt into the elbow crease too as the warmth gives off a burst of smell throughout the day.|`|4F034xtCaa	I always keep a 2 oz bottle of spray with me and shoot it at least 3 times through out the day.

VenYUtH6aa	good ol' martha stewart would recommend vinegar and baking soda for the silver. line your sink with foil and cover the ring with baking soda and vinegar on the foil to make a paste. let it soak and wipe off. i clean silver this way all the time.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Take the ring to a professional jewelry repair place to clean it.<br>  <br>  Don't try to clean it - you might damage it.|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	Since the ring has a stone it that would be ruined by chemical silver jewelry cleaner. Use a Sterling Silver Polishing cloth to clean it instead.<br>  You can find them at the Wal-Mart jewelry counter next to the register.|`|wnL4R6NVaa	I'd take it to a professional.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can get a small tray and layer with a foil, shiny side up.

This works great with silver jewelry but I'm not sure about the Jade|`|AA12087857	You should take it to a professional,  but if that's not an option,  try toothpaste.

QVrEEmFHaa	I think it's a good idea, it sounds like it has a lot of meaning to it :-]<br>  <br>  If you go to a good shop, they'll tell you how big/small they can make it with all the detail, not just do whatever size you say. When I got mine on my wrist I wanted it smaller, but they wouldn't do it because it would look like crap later.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, that spot doesn't hurt a lot more than anywhere else [I'm not sure if you have any other tattoos to compare the pain to]. Also they won't hit any veins, if you were worried about that hahaha I asked, and he looked at me like I was stupid. But anyways, no, it doesn't hurt too bad but I guess it all depends on how you handle pain.<br>  <br>  Also if you get it on your wrist, be prepared to have eeeeeeeeeeeeeverybody who sees it ask about it. I even get strangers coming up to me asking about it, lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! :-]|`|UYnZtJ2daa	Well...we don't really know how small it is so we can't tell you if it can stay the size it is. But generally, smaller tattoos can't have a lot of detailing. It can look all blurred and whatnot. Go talk to an artist about what size you can get it done.<br>  <br>  And no one can tell you about pain. Everyone is different.|`|kCdISEGqaa	The wrist is very sensitive, don't listen to people who tell you they don't hurt.  I am very heavily covered and all of my tattoos hurt.  As for the detail in the crucifix, it's not likely that it will show good being that small.  Something like that should be done larger to allow for more detail.  If you came in to my shop, I would recommend a different place for it.  I love the idea, but, on the wrist, you would compromise the quality of the tattoo.|`|ukVNUgPFaa	you could def get a tat on your wrist. everyone does that. uhhh religious icons are iffy to get unless your esuper dedicated. depending on the skill of the artist, they should be able to give it lots of detail without comprimising its size. here are some pics to print and take with you.<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetattoostudio/23584416" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/thetattoost...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.religioustattoos.net/Other_Tattoos/Rosary/rosary_3.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustattoos.net/Other_Ta...</a>|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	The larger a tattoo is the better detailed it can be...unless you find a very talented artist. <br>  <br>  ALL tattoos hurt and I'd imagine your wrist would hurt pretty damn bad....be prepared.|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	can we know the actual size pls|`|bj1qKTYuaa	i wouldn't have it too small...over time the lines on tattoos spread and as you can imagine the closer the lines are together the worse the tattoo will look, you could have it bigger somewhere, or just the silhouette of it on your wrist!<br>  <br>  pain wise, wrists are noted as being one of the more painful areas generally, i have both of mine tattooed and i didn't find it any worse then anywhere else...but pain is a different thing from person to person, in my experience it wasn't the vein area that hurt it was more to the outer sides of your wrist where the boney bits are|`|hizRPh9raa	The wrist is going to be sensitive, but no more than the hip. It won't be hitting bone, so it won't hurt as bad as the ankle or anything like that. I wouldn't be too concerned about the pain there. As far as keeping the design small with a lot of detail, that may be difficult. There's more of a risk of the ink running and it looking bad over time. I would think about expanding the design of just leaving some of the detail out. It's better to have the work look good than overly busy which could result in the tattoo looking severely flawed. Good luck.|`|MuBrEem1aa	Well I can assure you that the curfix is going to be nice!!!<br>  <br>  But maybe you should ask the artist to tell you an ideal size so that it can still be small and detailed!<br>  And don't worry about the pain if the pen is not hitting a bone it is not going to hurt you will probably feel ticklish!!!<br>   <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|iPQqPkhTaa	the ones that hurt the most, imo, are the ones over a bone. i have a tattoo on the inside of my forearm. i barely felt it. the one on my tailbone made me cry like a little girl.|`|uTl0W2hraa	no it doesnt hurt to get a tatoo on ur wrist it hurts more like on you foot or back <br>  yes the tatoo shopd could make it as detailed as it is in reality but besure to hire a really good professional tatoo artist
YsAEPYwOaa	I personally think it is a matter of preference.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I guess it depends on how you look and if it goes well with your facial features. I've seen boys with MUCH bigger afros and it was okay and they didn't look weird or anything and it was obvious they wanted the BAA (big a$$ afro) look. My hair comes down to the top of my eyes, but it still looks like it's one to two inches long, but it's actually 4 inches long. I have 50% shrinkage. I'm a female, btw.|`|WbmqNSayaa	haha..sure. go for it. just don't blame me when it catches on fire or gets caught in a low-hanging celieng fan. :)|`|xADIsKnVaa	Since you're biracial I would assume the curls are a bit looser so we're not talking about a regular bowl-shaped afro here. Growing it out would look really cool then, I think. It will give you a very relaxed, easy-going look and will give you styling options too.<br>  <br>  Don't cover your eyes though because it's not only uncomfortable, but looks kinda weird. Instead grow till it's right below your eyebrows to get the same effect.

HAVE FUN AND GOOD LUCK!|`|busvRidhaa	Depends on the time and style of the wedding. If a wedding is black tie only, that usually means you should wear a formal gown and your date should wear a tux. These are the most formal type of weddings and not all wedding are black tie only! Never wear the same color of a bridesmaid dresses if you can find out what color they are wearing. Lots of people are wearing black these days which used to not be appropriate for a wedding but I'd say unless it's a daytime wedding or a garden wedding, black is fine for formal and night weddings. Also, remember this day is about eh bride and groom so wearing something too sexy or wearing a white dress (NEVER wear white to someone else's wedding) is not appropriate and simply not in good taste. <br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|PxtmMAMnaa	you dont want to show up the bride, but of course you still want to look good! wear a solid dress in a muted color, nothing too bright.

98WKYtfwaa	I really don't recommend getting a tattoo relating to your baby, simply because if you get a portrait of her done and a little saying and you have more kids, they'll question why they're not tattooed on your body too. <br>  <br>  I think the dumbo idea is nice, you could get it done on your other wrist, top of your arm or foot. I personally don't really like women with tattoos of things on their top arm.|`|e2NQUmusaa	I think that the Dumbo Idea is GREAT, I have Tigger Tattoo for my son and a Piglet tattoo for my daughter that passed away.

IIztioS3aa	the only part of your hair that is alive is the roots, the rest of it is just dead cells being pushed out and down the line.<br>  <br>  if your hair looks lifeless and dull, try a deep conditioner, or something that says that it promotes healthy hair, like tressume, pantine pro v or the fructis sleek and shine. i really like the aussie protect and soften line.<br>  <br>  if its flat looking, you may have too much build up in your hair of product or whatever. give yourself a scalp massage whenever you get your hair wet and be sure to thoroughly rinse out your shampoo and conditioner. (that might help stimulate your hair growth a little, making your hair come in faster and healthier.)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|xieiM0FRaa	What do you mean by dead?<br>  And what have you done to it/do to it on a daily basis?<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|inMfHLWoaa	umm a hair cut and products for dull, life-less hair!<br>  x|`|8jY4JUw7aa	nope|`|2OU6UNW4aa	any product that has deep moisturizing balm and aloe in it works great. i damaged my hair so bad by coloring it a million times and thats what wworked for me. you can find something similar to it at any hair salon or a store like sallys. they sell similar products at walmart but it doesnt work the best. hope i helped|`|R84KyAF2aa	hair is dead cells basicly so its allways been dead|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Try a good deep conditioner, it may leave your hair heavy for a day or two, but it should help with any damage that's giving it that lifeless look. Also, try a good hair glosser, I have one by Ion that is a spray, just a couple of sprays and then run a few fingers through and super shiny hair, be careful, even one spray too much can leave you looking greasy.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	Did you know, human hair is dead?<br>  Its a fact by the way!
PeNTl6KOaa	okaay.<br>  <br>  start off with the nerve thing - there isn't much chance that the piercist will get a nerve because hes a profesional (make sure you go somewhere to get it done and not uself) you would know if he hit a nerve, so would the piercist, if he does he would stop and get tissue to try stop the blood, but there isnt a huge chance that he will hit the nerve.<br>  <br>  when u go to the place have a look around to see if its a clean place, if you can see needle's everywhere and it looks really dirty then dnt do it as he could b using needles that hes used before.<br>  <br>  umm, id give it like 5 days to heal at least because i was talkin a bit funny to start and i couldnt eat anything due to the swellin (this will prob happen) so try doing it duting a school holida if i was you so at least it will have enoguht time to heal.<br>  <br>  hiding it - well you can get clear tongue bars but no one much notices mine, as long as you dnt wak around and showin it off to the teachers then they shouldnt mind, but if they tell you to take out, dont becuase it could close.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, if u need anything else, email me<br>  <br>  roxanne.mcmullin@yahoo.co.uk<br>  <br>  xxxx bye for now<br>  <br>  <br>  (soz if my spellin is bad lol)<br>  <br>  x|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	i had my tongue pierced twice before its really not a big deal to hide or to heal, you can even ask the person that does it to  pierce it so that its not noticeable when you talk. <br>  <br>  Also it won't hit a nerve that's a myth<br>  <br>  Have fun and Goodluck

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  One of the most common acne scar treatment is laser resurfacing, or the application of soft and highly focused light on the surface of the skin to "burn" acne. However, this approach is only advisable for minor acne types like blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples.  Laser resurfacing is actually the closest literal equivalent of actual "acne removal" technique that is currently available.  This is because laser resurfacing will actually remove acne.  Since burning would naturally produce scars, people are quite hesitant to avail of this acne removal method.  But such worries are unfounded.  Laser resurfacing also includes a post-burning treatment that would stimulate the instant growth of collagen.  <br>  <br>  If you are interested in other effective treatments for acne scars, you can refer to this site : <a href="http://acne.best-health-remedy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://acne.best-health-remedy.com/</a>|`|MjKOBQQqaa	To fade an acne scar will be easy. All you've got to do is exfoliate regularly.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation is simply the removal of the top layer of skin (called the epidermis).<br>  <br>  This layer can be removed by using Glycolic Acids and or Salicylic Acids (chemical peels). Or mechanically (microdermabrasion)<br>  <br>  By regularly removing the epidermis...you'll also be removing the skin that is scarred by your acne.<br>  <br>  To remove the scar quickly...<br>  <br>  ...I recommend visiting a doctor and inquiring about a deep facial peel.<br>  <br>  A deep peel removes the epidermis at a greater depth. And as a result the scar will disappear in no time. <br>  <br>  But... I must warn you that deep peels are expensive.<br>  <br>  You can also remove the scars with at-home facial peels. These products usually contain alpha-hydroxy acids and/or beta hydroxy acids. <br>  <br>  Or you can buy a facial scrub. This is a cream which contains tiny particles to scrub away the epidermis.<br>  <br>  These at home versions are effective and less costly. <br>  <br>  But...<br>  <br>  ...they work slower than the doctor's versions. And you must use them at least 3 times a week if they are to be effective.<br>  <br>  For more information about exfoliation and acne scars treatment...|`|F37Bi5YVaa	A common method of acne scar treatment is the use of certain chemicals to peel off your skin. Chemicals like salicylic or lactic acid, lycolic are used to peel off the damaged top layer of your skin. Such procedures stimulate the growth of a new and smoother layer. The peels are usually done over a period of time and are effective against pigmented scars. This acne scar treatment is even very effective for active acne.|`|eeUhEGeVaa	I have struggles with acne for years. I have tried so many products and i have been to the dermatologist many times.. will i have tried both perscription and over the counter the one that i have found that works best with my skin is the neutrogena skin care 3 step routine, you can find it in your local drug store or walmart. Its only 20 bucks and it has left my skin clear and soft. I still have a few breakouts every so often and i still have scaring from previous acne but it really has worked well in keeping my skin clear. I also scrub a couple times a week with the clinique face scrub. Its a little expensive but it is well worth your money. I have been using the same tube since december.

lyp6JEcEaa	First of all , you have gone crazy! LOL. You are doing waaaaay to much all at once. First things first. Acne is 90% of the time brought on by something not going correctly within your body, either it is hormonal (most of the time), your body not detoxing, age/heredity related issues. As you are on birth control your homones are being screwed with. You need to tak it back a notch. I have had acne most all my life I used everything, Murad, proactive, mary kay, clinique, neutrogena, etc etc... These are VERY BAD for your skin. I didn't realize the very things I was using on my skin where the very things breaking me out. Just to let you know STAY AWAY FROM DRUGSTORE BRANDS! Did you know the clean and clear line uses PETROLATUM AND MINERAL OIL? Both of these CAUSE ACNE they are very comedogenic and acneogenic. Mineral oil is from the petrolem industry, a gasoline by product. The molecules in mineral oil are too large to penetrate your skin so they sit on top and CLOG PORES causing acne. I have been a skin care specialist for over 10 years now and I was tuned onto a natural organic brand called Faerie Organic. This is what you need. They take it back to nature and your skin will heal. First off their makeup actually heals acne while you wear it and it is light and airy and looks very natural. They have a mineral in them called boron nitride which is antibacterial and actually helps heal acne, they also have zinc oxide which is anti-inflammatory, it helps redness and inflammation. Anyone suffering with acne really should look into their makeup as it is amazing. I highly suggest you get their free mineral sample kit, so you can see what a  difference it will make. Their acne kit is also amazing and had changed my life. I rarely get a breakout anymore. Maybe they would give you samples to try. You need to get away from all these mainstream products they contain chemicals and toxic substances that can give you "chemical induced acne". Going natural will help trust me. You can get that free sample kit here........<a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|hcEZGk8Caa	Well your face is pry all dry and stuff from the acne cleanser they usually do more harm then good. If you want something good go to the dermatologist. And if your make up makes you break out try minerals.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	aveeno cleanser|`|AA12112469	She is right. Proactive is about the only product I know of that works and I should know having two teenage boys...but since you have a monetary issue (of which we all do), I would suggest contacting the doctor you got the Yaz from. Maybe try googling "acne cures". Sorry I can't be more help. I have been lucky and never had any acne problems. Good luck.|`|dPk7dr7laa	I have used everything out there known to man for my acne. I am an adult now and it came back too. I have used Arbonne, Proactive, Murad, and a ton of other stuff. I found that washing my face everyday with Neutragena acne stress wash and then using the Neutragena toner helps a little but ttotally the only thing that really worked the best was when I got married I satrted to use Birth controland it cleared my skin right up. My problem is hormonal. I have a clean face it is the hormones that make me break out and no acne stuff like proactive would ever work for me.|`|QS7YXXG6aa	I agree try proactive, I actually have it on right now. its really a big help for me but all people are different. <br>  <br>  doesn't hurt to try :)|`|bd499f5017ffc8776de9bfd98e2a4ef1aa	use proactive, it works, its only 20 bucks, you wont be disapointed.

Neither of them are emo, the first one is a huge jock and the other is in a rock band.

mAjQLl7Faa	On the Tyra Banks show, a makeup artist showed a tip that I have used again and again. With your foundation, (liquid or powder) get some on your finger and pat it underneath your eye, right where the under eye bag is. Go all under your eye, patting with your pointer finger. Keep patting until the darkness is concealed and do that with your other eye. Make sure you use your finger, not a brush. Hope this helps!|`|AdLLUbpzaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=excYvmsRdW4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=excYvmsRd...</a><br>  <br>  there u go!<br>  <br>  youtube is the source for EVERYTHING
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	You need to avoid washes as these strip away natural oils which actually causes skin to produce more oil which clogs pores, your skin is oily actually because your skin is over compensating for all the natural oils it's loosing from your skin care routine. <br>  <br>  Try using Oil Cleansing Method (OCM) which maintains natural oils keeping skin healthy so prevents acne and oily skin. For OCM mix half extra virgin olive oil to moisturize and half castor oil to cleanse, also try adding a little tea tree oil which is antibacterial. Massage into your face then put a hot face cloth over your face for a minute to open pores, then wipe off oil, any trace amounts are absorbed into skin so won't be greasy. <a href="http://www.moogoo.com.au/category13_1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.moogoo.com.au/category13_1.ht...</a> <br>  <br>  I've used OCM for years, I had VERY oily skin, as well as flaky skin and suffered from a lot of spots, blackheads and whiteheads on my chin. The first time I used OCM my skin stopped being flaky, then a week later on the way home from shopping in town when my face would normally be dripping in oil I noticed that thanks to using OCM my face wasnât oily at all but very soft. I have no spots and my complexion is lovely, I know a hell of a lot of people who use OCM with the same great results. What I like about it is that you can change it to suit your skin as your skin changes, in the winter I use more olive oil to moisturise during harsh weather, in the summer I will switch to only using Jojoba oil which is nice and thin so better for summer, or if I do get spots Iâll pop some tea tree oil in to stop the breakout. <br>  <br>  The different steps in different cleansers is really no different from the steps you need to take in your daily skin care routine anyway. A few things to remember, and to help deal with your spots. Be sure to use your own face cloth and towel, keeping them clean and dry to avoid bacterial growth, also follow cleansing with moisturizing, as long as it's not greasy it won't cause spots instead it'll keep skin healthy â remembering oil is good for skin try Bio Oil to moisturize and heal scars. Once a week steam to open pores, do this by putting your head over hot water with a towel over it, but don't do this dueing breakouts as it stimulates blood flow and oil glands. Exfoliate weekly to scrub off dead skin, use something with rounded beads to avoid damage to your skin which can cause more spots, or you may want to try cosmetic vinegar which also promotes circulation, regulates skins pH and is antiseptic. Mix 500ml of apple cider vinegar, 3ml lavender essential oil, 3ml rosemary essential oil, 2ml rosewood essential oil, and 2 tablespoons glycerine, place into a glass bottle, use as cleanser by adding 1 tablespoon vinegar to 1 cup of water. Try masks too, there are many easy recipes online, see Make Your Own Cosmetics <a href="http://www.makeyourcosmetics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.makeyourcosmetics.com</a> or Pioneer Thinking <a href="http://www.pioneerthinking.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pioneerthinking.com</a> try this strawberry acne mask; mix together ? cup fresh strawberries, 1 egg white, and 2 teaspoons of honey until smooth. To use spread over face and leave for 15 minutes, rinse off with cool water and pat dry. This one is good as strawberries are rich in salicylic acid which is commonly used in acne treatments, honey is also antibacterial.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	I've dealt with the same problem all my life and tried all the soaps.

You need to keep facial wipes with you at all times and use a warm washcloth at home with a very mild soap like neutragena,etc. Harsh cleansers add to the oiliness, by creating more oil. Use after washing a lemon juice and warm water rinse. It only takes a minute to use a facial wipe away from home when you notice excessive oil on your face, but don't use the ones with lots of moisturizers, use the ones for your hands that have less moisturizers in them and more alcohol. Or you can use the waterless hand cleaners that come in a gel too, but keep them away from the eyes and nostrils.

xjazE0xmaa	Three things are stamped inside jewelry bands:<br>  --Gold purity (you already spotted that one, the 10K)<br>  --A message from the giver to the receiver<br>  --The jeweler or manufactuer's stamp<br>  <br>  C2 is most likely the manufacturer's stamp, as it doesn't have any obvious meaning as a term of endearment.<br>  <br>  Your real question is whether it's a real stone or not.  If it is a diamond, it is likely to be fairly low quality.  Most jewelers will use 14K or higher to set a valuable diamond.  However, if you'd like a list of tricks to help you figure out whether the stone is a diamond or not, here's a nice list (article link below).  Some won't work if the setting hides certain parts of the diamond.  Of course, the real test is to take it to an appraiser.  But these tricks can help if you don't want to take that step:<br>  <br>  --Look for scratches. While real diamonds acquire scratches, chips, dents, and the like over time, other materials show the wear and tear much faster. If you see visible scars, be on alert. And if you, a non-gemologist, can see visible scars on a natural diamond, expect the diamond to be priced much lower than Rapaport value. <br>  <br>  --If it comes loose easily, place the loose diamond over newsprint and attempt to read through the diamond. If you can read through the diamond, it is either a fake or a poor cut (âlow cutâ). <br>  <br>  --Breathe on the diamond just as you would to fog a window. If the fog remains more than two seconds, itâs likely a fake. Repeat the fog test on the bottom of the diamond; some fakes are crafted with a diamond surface and synthetic underside. <br>  <br>  --Place the stone under ultraviolet light (like a black light--try a party store where they're sometimes on display anyway), and watch for blue fluorescence. Medium to strong blue indicates a real diamond. If there is no blue fluorescence, either the diamond is of excellent quality or it is a fake. <br>  <br>  --Look with magnification at the stone. Facets should be joined with sharp lines, not rolls. The girdle should have facets; it should not be waxy or slick. Most diamonds have natural internal flaws; most fakes do not. <br>  <br>  --Moissanite, a popular diamond substitute, sparkles greatly in outdoor light but appears dull with incandescent lighting. <br>  <br>  --To keep costs low, fake gems are often machine cut, rather than hand crafted. Machine cut moissanite will not display the âhearts and arrowsâ seen in hand-cut, natural diamonds. <br>  <br>  --A jeweler may offer to prove a diamond is real by using his diamond tester. Be cautious, as moissanite will frequently fool a diamond testerâand a smart jeweler knows this. <br>  <br>  --When a cubic zirconia stone is submerged in water, the gemstone virtually disappears; a natural diamond is easily visible. The water enhances the two stonesâ differences in light refraction. <br>  <br>  --Weigh the stone on a scale you trust. Cubic zirconia weighs approximately 55% more than diamond.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
88c4777c32d78e4aef4bcfc97ac73c93aa	1. The pain differs from person to person. From personal experience it depends on how thick skinned you are. It seems that paler people tend to have a thinner skin and its easier to get the piercing through. I'm a little darker complected and it was much harder to get through my skin then my girlfriends so mine hurt much more. As hurts did not hurt at all. <br>  2. Yes, you watch them do it. They take a pen and mark where they are going to pierce it at. Then they take a small clamp (feels like a little pinch) and they clamp around the hole. They then take a sterile needle and pierce through the hole. They'll put the belly button ring in and off you go!<br>  3. It hurts for a few weeks after. You'll have to sleep on your back and keep it clean. (Sleeping on your belly can result in the belly button ring getting stuck on bed linens and thats no fun!)<br>  4. I dont remember how long you have to wait, but the piercer will be more then glad to answer your questions.<br>  5. The piercing will get stuck on sweaters or knits depending on the ring you have in. You have to be careful. Anything gaudy can get stuck. I prefered to keep a simple ring in mine.<br>  6. It doesnt matter if your fat or skinny. I think it's all about your pain tolerance and how thick your skin is. The clamp wasnt for her fat, it was the same clamp they use to line up the piercing hole. <br>  7. I loved my belly button ring. You just have to take care of it, as they get infected very, very easily.|`|zYVCJRMXaa	1. It was a 1 for me and i bet for you.<br>  2. The mark your stomach first. Then they have you lay down or in a laid down position. So you may or may not see them doing it. They then clamp the place which is the part you feel but doesnt hurt. Just breathe deely they then shove the needle through. Take the clamp off, and then shove the jelwery through. Hold the jelwery and screw the top ball on then clean the are and volia you are done.<br>  3. It doesnt even really hurt but it is a little sore when you bend over or sit some. This will only last a few days, 1-3.<br>  4. 6 months is the ideal healing time for a belly piercing, dont change it until you will end up having to heal it longer and take care of it (i know i did it)<br>  5. Not really, but always be careful when removing clothes though thats when they like to get caught. Also depending on the material it it pulls then probably will at some point so stray away from putting those directly on.<br>  6. Not really its based on how much skin is placed on the belly button, not fat or skinny, im skinny but i was able to get it done. <br>  7. Sea salt soaks is the care for it not bactince or ointments or alcohol just plain old sea salt. After 6 months yay. ALso after about a week it should start to puss, yeah not the most pleasant but it doesnt like ooze and get everywhere so its nothing major but just be warned that is part of the healing process. You must care for it though because it is easily infected for the first two months clean 3 times a day then you can reduce to two times.|`|na8ObA5Haa	It only feels like a little pinch, you dont see it because you have to lay down, the dangley piercing can get caught on clothes but the stud that you have to wear for awhile does not. i weigh 96 pound there is not a tiny bit of fat anywhere on my body and it didnt hurt me at all! you cant swim or go to the beach for a couple months after you get it done. clean it everyday so you dont get an infection. & it will be soar for a couple of days, you wont be able to really bend or sleep on your stomach! trust me this is a piece of cake! and totally worth it. i have had my for 4 years now and still love it! <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|TzWkFq2Naa	i want one too<br>  but my friends say<br>  it only hurts for the first day or two<br>  but are annoying to clean<br>  but they dont look pretty with a lot of fat<br>  im not trying to be mean im just<br>  trying to be honest|`|2LUa46c6aa	it hurts for a min and yes i can c how they do it but its done very fast......|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	I am scared of needles also, you don't have to look and its over so quick by the time you feel anything it will already be over.<br>  <br>  1. i would give it a 6, its a quick pinch and then it burns a little, its a pain to bend over for a week or so after you get it done.<br>  2. my piercer leaned my chair back so i couldn't see it being done. He pulls your skin out just a little bit and sticks a needle through it, then puts the jewelry in, is over in a matter of seconds.<br>  3. its a little tender for about a week, mostly when you bend down or bend over.<br>  4. my piercer told me to wait at least 6 months to change it, i have had mine done for 5 months.<br>  5. mine has never been stuck, just don't wear super tight clothes that will rub against it alot and irritate it.<br>  6. my piercer did tell me that the heavier you are the less it hurts, but i am super skinny and it still didn't hurt much. When he uses the clamp he just pulls a little bit of skin so he can get the needle through it. It has nothing to do with being heavy or skinny.<br>  7. i absolutely love my piercing, i would do it again, they are so cute, just be sure to clean it with sea salt soaks or h2ocean that they will probably sell at the piercing shop. Keep it clean and don't use alcohol or peroxide.

No skin can ever get used to something this strong.|`|ovPfkHSCaa	Many individuals have used various acne products without actually having any success in clearing their skin. And let's face it, acne is a enormous nuisance! Don't worry though - getting clear skin is entirely possible.<br>  <br>  First off, let's take a look the reason why the acne treatment products you buy in the drugstores almost never work. It's important to know this if you want to clear your skin. The trouble with most of of the treatments out there is that they are designed to only cover up or treat pimples AFTER they have already appeared. They merely try to get rid of pimples one by one rather than treating acne at the heart of the issue.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-

They have clothes for girls your age and they are wayyyy cute.  Tillys is by far my favorite store ever|`|4be98dd607dfed9ad18400ef02923955aa	idk were you live or what style your looking for so there for i can really give you a straight straight answer. but from my personal shopping experiences with myself and friends i'd say wet seal and together they have sorta like pop rock clothing (modern) and they cary VERY small sizes. Limited too might be a little to young for your taste idk but when i was around age 13 is when i stoped shopping there. That's more of a 9-12 thing TO ME. Also packsun and hollister like has very sun bathed you know beachy clothing. Me personally i dont like the store but thats just my style. Against all odds again carry VERY small sizes and its more of a like urben/indie thing and like hip hop too. Me personally i dont shop much unless i have money to burn but my friends like hot topic (expensive clothing. Pants arent worth the price they are) and zumies (even more expensive) but idk thats their taste i like it too but i dont have $74 dollars to burn on one jacket that will barely last me through winter and then get bored with it. but everything up top i mentioned is pretty reasonable.<br>  hope i helped.<br>  Loves, keep looking beautiful ^_~|`|5FLDzyhTaa	Abercrombie, Ed hardy,Hollister, Ruehl etc. you should definitely check these sites<br>  <a href="http://www.discountshollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discountshollywood.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.raininghollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.raininghollywood.com</a><br>  shipping is FREE !!!!|`|tH7pVjmYaa	hollister<br>  american eagle<br>  i shop for my 10 yr old sister there haha.<br>  <br>  vanity if you guys have one.<br>  <br>  the buckle.<br>  <br>  rue 21.|`|QlJje9iAaa	Abercrombie<br>  Hollister<br>  Aeropostale<br>  Wet Seal|`|53eb2e3a77a123176238e48eed353879aa	aeropostale should be good....I was (am) really short for my age (im 16) and aeropostale always fit me.|`|a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	-Abercrombie & Fitch<br>  -Hollister<br>  -Aeropostale<br>  -American Eagle<br>  -Limited Too<br>  <br>  They have really cute clothes.

You probably only get around $50 if you sold it at a consignment shop too. You could possibly put flyers around school and sell it to another girl at your school and possibly get half for it.. Just a suggestion.|`|tk2AOZU5aa	I would have it cleaned first of all. Then, here are a few options. You can put it for sale on-line like on e-bay, Craigs list, etc. You could sell it to another girl in your class, or you can take it to a store that buys dresses and see what they will give you for it. Probably your best bet would be to sell it on e-bay. Make sure you have really good pictures, size, description and that the dress is in really good condition.<br>  <br>  I had the same problem. Unfortunatley, I didn't have e-bay 15 years ago.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
fvre0o9laa	I'd suggest a good pattern with good directions, like:<br>  <a href="http://kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_detail.cfm?pid=3602&QL=KwikStart" rel="nofollow">http://kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_detail.cf...</a><br>  <br>  This is a pattern with instructions written for beginners.  Conventional choices for the waistline would be elastic or drawstring.<br>  <br>  What you're going to do:<br>  Choose the right pattern size (by your measurements, not by the size clothes you buy -- your pattern size will probably be 2-3 sizes larger (or more!) than the size clothes you buy)<br>  <br>  Pin a copy of the correct size pattern pieces to your fabric, making sure the grain arrows on the pattern pieces are parallel to the selvage (the finished edge of the fabric).  Cut out the fabric accurately.<br>  <br>  Sew the front crotch curve together on the front pieces.<br>  Sew the back crotch curve together on the back pieces.<br>  Sew the inseams and the side seams.<br>  Finish the waistband.<br>  Hem the pants/shorts.
Ll4yjTa7aa	i find the cold ready strips the best. i find them stickier.<br>  i tried some veet hot wax the other day and was disappointed that it grabbed hold of some hairs but not others :S so i think il go back to the strips. always warm wax is annoyin coz you have to warm it then let it cool so you dont burn. then wash the strips afterwards. with the cold disposable strips you just bung them in the bin!<br>  <br>  i dont think theres much diff in the time the hair grows back

bXkvtg7maa	1)First, it is important to buy a good straightener. My favorite brand of straighteners is called Chi. The Chi can be fairly expensive, but it is made with ceramic which does very little if any damage to your hair. Another good brand of hair straightener is Paul Mitchell. Make sure that you buy a straightener that is ceramic so that your hair is protected from the heat of the straightener. <br>  <br>  2)After you wash your hair apply a dime size drop of Thermal Care Hair Serum. This product does a wonderful job of stopping hair and protecting your hair from damage a hair straightener, blow dryer, or curling iron.<br>   <br>  3)If you can let your hair air dry. The less heat you put on your hair the better. <br>  <br>  4)Make sure your hair is completely dry before you straighten it. Try your best to only go over each section of hair once with your straightener. Going over it more than once will cause hair to become damaged.<br>  <br>  5)Once a week apply a deep conditioner to your hair. This will allow your hair to get moisture back that it might have lost from the use of the hair straightener. Garnier and Aussie both make affordable and quality deep conditioners for hair.|`|WDbE5gffaa	Don't use too high a temperature, as a guide:<br>  190 degrees for fine hair<br>  210 for normal hair<br>  230 for thick hair<br>  Use straighteners which don't snag hair<br>  Use a heat defence spray before straightening<br>  and only straighten completely dry hair.|`|QFnaCs5saa	You need to buy an expensive iron, and use nicer products. If you follow the instructions correctly, and talk to your hair stylist about YOUR hair's natural tendencies, then it shouldn't harm you hair.

If he is to young to grin and bear the pain of you lancing it then I would take him in, or if it has been there for a while take him in for sure.

FZRZFusuaa	You should just call the school and ask them about it - there is no obligation for you to go there - it would be very helpful for you so make an well educated decision about it though.<br>  <br>  I went to cosmetology school (not Paul Mitchell though) over 8 years ago and tuition  was $15000.00   That included all styling tools and books, manikins, etc.
jWmnSXlLaa	I can't tell a differince in my face with only powder on but thats just me. I prefer loose powder. I think it gives a better finnish.|`|9Zp02n1Naa	Loose powder give you more natural and light weight finishing but you are only 13 just a slightly touch up of lip gloss is enough for you.
JGMWR6wVaa	You can tuck in the front of your boot cut jeans inside the tongue but I would suggest for you to go with skinny jeans and they would be super cute since you have such small feet.|`|g21gg5dRaa	just wear you jeans over the top . . . your hardly going to tuck your jeans into them eh.<br>  not much ways you can wear them im afraid.
8jY4JUw7aa	apply lightly|`|2uZivThaaa	whats good for brown eyes is use brown or goldish eye shadow and line the top lid with brown to black eyeliner. Then curl your eye lashes and apply brown or black mascara to the top and bottom lashes! You'll have a natural yet beautiful look without a ton of eye make up! <br>  <br>  **Also you can apply a light shimmer to the corners of your eyes (the corners closest to your nose) to give your self a pretty wide eyed look!|`|XWhV3U29aa	You didn't say your age but im guess 12-14? I hope lol. I work at a salon/makeup place and a lot of teenage girls have that same question. You don't want to look too made up at your age so Id go with earthy tones for eyeshadow, kind of like this!<br>  <a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/2192493/ang_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a>   (I know blue hazel is not your eye color, but something more natural believe it or not, will make brown eyes pop too!)<br>  also to make those brown eyes pop even more maybe wear brownish- black/soft black mascara. Dont wear eyeliner other wise you'lll just look like a hooker.That's too much, unless your older then go for it. Hope I helped|`|hV8wyZ0taa	Ask the Obamatron!
uij93NOjaa	My suggestion would be to get some generic silk treatment at a beauty store like sallys or something like that in your neighborhood. I have curly hair and it really works, it's 6 FL. OZ. and it only costs $8.00!!! Don't get it straightened or permanently straightened because trust me it will still frizz but if your going to do it with this product than i say go for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  A lot of beauty salons use this! All you have to do is when you get out of the shower( it can be used on dry or wet hair) and apply a small amount from then top to them bottom and there you have it!!!  It also doesn't weigh down your hair, it lets your hair breathe!|`|AbtCfY1caa	be happy, be proud.  don't fall for the illusion of trying to be something you are not. if that does not work try just for me hair lotion.|`|RGSSYFPyaa	pantene pro v..<br>  its called curl shaper iits soOO good.<br>  andits only about $7|`|N0wFP8GWaa	go to the salon and have them do the japanese straight perm . or whatever else straightening process they have . it stays straight for anywhere from 6 months to 2 years . but you have to not put any product in your hair for the first three days . it's worth it , but how much it costs will depend on how long your hair is . it also depends on what salon you go to . its usually 100 or higher . but like i said , it's worth it .|`|tLV0XPUnaa	YOU SHOULD JUST LIKE IT SRAIGHT AND GO TO THE SALON AND GET PERFESONALLY DONE LIKE EVERYONE DONE|`|8jY4JUw7aa	straightener
R7ACldBKaa	we alway's had that kind of clothes and hairstyle (maybe since the mid-late ninties?), i think you guys took some ideas and made it a little different. But we don't treat it as "scene" or "emo," we just do it to show originality, but mostly to be cute and show off *_*|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	People in the US dressed like this in the 80's... I was an 80's child I know these things.  It has a few slight differences, but mainly it was 80's style.
GItWq2mGaa	1. Trim the lashes.<br>  <br>            *<br>              If the lash is wider than your eye, trim one side of it lash by lash.<br>            *<br>              Optionally, trim the individual lashes to make them look more natural. They should be longer towards the outer corner of the eye, and the lash length should vary slightly.<br>     2.<br>        Squeeze eyelash glue onto the back of your hand and run the eyelash along it. Blow softly from edge to edge to make the glue a little less runny to apply your lashes.<br>     3.<br>        Pick the lashes up with tweezers and bring it as close to your natural lash line as possible.<br>     4.<br>        Press from end to end and hold until the glue dries (30 seconds to a minute, or sometimes less depending upon the adhesive). This allows the glue to set so that when you lift your fingertips from it, the lashes won't come along for the ride<br>     5.<br>        Apply mascara while pressing your finger behind the fake lashes. This will bond the false lashes with yours.(It may be beneficial to use an eyelash curler before applying mascara)<br>     6.<br>        Fill any gaps between the false lashes and your natural lash line with eyeliner.
KjVKNjwNaa	line the whole lower lid...not under lid...right on it!|`|05763ada899f7f726eec7519cb570d77aa	You should put it on your bottom water line and the inner corners of your eye to brighten your eyes. Don't put it close to your top lashes because that is out and doesn't look good.|`|qjutViNuaa	Well if you want to make your eyes look bigger you apply it to your bottom waterline( right above your bottom lashes). This makes your eye  look like it continues.|`|9D6Y4dYuaa	Hi Doll!<br>  <br>  Not to be rude...but you shouldn't apply white eyeliner anywhere. It was a quick fad in the late 90's that died out faster than it started. But, there are some tricks to open up the eye if that's what you are tying to do. And you have the right idea, I suppose. However using a shimmer shadow will work and look much, much better. <br>  <br>  If you have light features, look for a brown or gray liner to use. Sometimes black can be too harsh. But if you have olive or dark skin, then black liner is fine. Apply liner to the entire top lash line, for extra emphasis make sure to smudge the liner really well into the lashes. If you feel the need to use liner on your lower lash line, start from the outer crease and only go half way in. Lining the entire lower lash line tends to close the eye. <br>  <br>  Finish off with your mascara and use the tip of your finger to add shimmer to the inner corners of your eyes. Not too much though, a little will go a long way in this area. Apply shadow as necessary and add the shimmer to the top part of the eyes underneath the brows. Light reflect off of shimmer shadow and opens the eye by highlighting. Hope this helps and good luck!<br>  <br>  Stay classy!|`|Bc3htRBYaa	Put it on your waterline and in the inner corner of your eye. then take a q-tip and blend it out gently.<br>  that should bring ur eyes out more :o)<br>  hope i helped!|`|8jY4JUw7aa	corners|`|ZUAFl3toaa	White eyeliner is kind of weird.. I'm not a huge fan of it.. but if I were to use it, the place to put it would be along the first third of the inner eye (from the tear duct, out) in a thin, fading line towards the end, and then I would meet it with a dark brown or black liner. Also, you always put dark liner on the water line.. white would look ridiculous. Keep in mind that a little white or light colored eyeshadow is great for highlighting the brown bow.. not heavy though.<br>  <br>  If you want your eyes to look bigger go for what I said with the liner, make the black on the top smudgy but not huge. Draw a thin line RIGHT above the lashes (use a magnifying mirror) and just smudge it a tiny bit so it's not so sharp. Before you do this though, apply shadow in 3 shades of what ever color you want: medium color covering the eyelid, lightest color highlighting the brow lightly, and on the actual lid area (below crease) and then blend the darkest color from your crease outwards.. but stay on the outer half of the eye.. you don't want the darkest color anywhere near the center (duct) because that will actually make your eyes look smaller and close together.<br>  <br>  With the black eyeliner, extend it outwards a tiny bit to lengthen the eye out, and the key to everything is to curl your lashes and apply lots of mascara! This will really open up your eye. Most people just end up putting mascara on the outer lashes though.. make sure you get it on those tiny inner lashes, and also on the bottom. I suggest Maybelline Full & Soft.. because it's literally what it's called, full and soft. The more you apply, the bigger and prettier your eyes will look, and don't be afraid to curl them gently after the mascara is pretty much dried.. just be careful not to crunch them up in the curler. The mascara will cause them to hold that curl longer.. and the curl really makes your eyes look big and open.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help! If you have any questions just email me! :)|`|13BsBvQ1aa	to make your eyes look bigger, you should put it on the inside corners of your eyes.

Before you decide to purchase from the online store, do yourself a favor and check out your local Rolex Authorized Dealer first.  That way you can actually view and handle different Rolex time pieces and make sure you find the "right" one.  If you are serious about purchasing, some (not all) Rolex Authorized Dealers can or may offer you a discounted price on their timepieces.  Taking this into account, Stein Diamond's prices are not really "too good to be true."  <br>  <br>  Purchasing from a Rolex Authorized Dealer will ensure that you are buying an authentic time piece.  Rolex does not sell their time pieces online.  BUT if you decide to purchase online, you can always take the time piece to your local Rolex Authorized Dealer to verify authenticity.<br>  <br>  Use the official Rolex website to locate an Authorized Dealer:<br>  <a href="http://www.rolex.com/en" rel="nofollow">http://www.rolex.com/en</a>|`|PU4zUlqbaa	I bought a ORIGINAL Rolex watch, but i didn't buy in Stein Diamonds but in Interwatches was a very satisfying experience in terms of prices and authenticity.

zC4cgGhqaa	It is pretty much universally accepted to be the best concealer out there as a lot of celebs use it.  The texture and colour is better than other concealers and the light reflecting effect it has is great, it looks very natural.<br>  <br>  How to use:  It has a 'clicker' on the end which pushes a small amount of concealer into the middle of the brush with each click.  You can use the brush or your fingers to blend it over undereye circles, red patches or any dark areas of the face such as around your nose.<br>  <br>  If using under your eyes, always use your RING finger (the one next to your pinkie) to pat the concealer over and then blend it in.  Your ring finger has a lighter touch and so is more gentle on your delicate undereye skin.<br>  <br>  Now and then it'll come on offer at Superdrug (if you're in the UK) but it is usually ï¿¡22.  Although expensive, it does last a LONG time.  You could try Loreal's Touche Magique - not QUITE as good but a very good immitation and a lot cheaper (perfect if you're on a budget!).  I use this every day and keep my Touche Eclat for special occasions :)|`|tESdl7gbaa	i used it under my under eye circles and it highlighted them and hid them really well. its one of my favourite under eye concealers, a cheaper version is no.7s it basically the same but a thinner formula.|`|Qhl7fqlhaa	I use it and i love it, i find it works best over foundation, gently patted in on my dark circles. It's not cheap but it's soooo worth it.|`|VL8e3E4zaa	I used it under my eyes and it worked quite well but only when I put foundation on over my whole face after if that makes sense.. that's probably only because I'm olive skinned though.

Before the age of modern medicine and chemical laboratories, healers and medicine men had natural products for hair growth and replacement.  Some of these are still used today with varying results. Strictly speaking, all hair loss products could be considered ânatural,â as they are produced from elements found on Earth.  <br>  <br>  A ânaturalâ remedy refers to any ingredient as it is found in nature and not altered or treated in any way before its use.  Some people claim success with these methods and products, so it is worthwhile to examine a few of the most popular.<br>  <br>  ESSENTIAL OILS:  These are concentrated oils from certain plants, such as lavender, soybean, and bay.  They are massaged into the scalp and are purported to assist with circulation and follicle stimulation.<br>  <br>  EXERCISE:  Any form of exercise increases and improves blood circulation to all parts of the body, including the scalp.  It is believed that increased blood supply to the cells in hair follicles will maintain their health and stimulate hair production.<br>  <br>  HERBAL COCKTAILS: (NOT FOR INGESTION):  A variety of herbs are recommended, to include Rosemary, Sage, Nettle and Burdock.  The advice is to boil them together, strain off the leaves, and wash the hair with the solution every day.<br>  <br>  JOJOBA OIL:  Widely used in Mexico for hundreds of years, it is massaged on the scalp, and many claim it is highly effective in stimulating new hair growth.<br>  <br>  LOWERING DHT: DHT is formed when an enzyme in a manâs body acts upon testosterone and is believed to be responsible for the âclosing-upâ of hair follicles.  Provillus shows a lot of prospect and may block DHT production and thus shows promise as an aide for male hair loss sufferers. <br>  <br>  Homeopathic physicians usually recommend that some of these treatments be used concurrently.  Some have had success, but, as in all cases, different bodies respond differently to any treatment.  Still, they are worth a try before more expensive methods are considered.<br>  <br>  For more information visit: <a href="http://1goodhealth.com/gothair/" rel="nofollow">http://1goodhealth.com/gothair/</a>|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Prenatal vitamins are essential for hair growth. You don't have to be eighteen or pregnant to take them, they are safe for everyone. Vitamin E is also very good for your hair. These two should help your hair grow faster!

TwXJS1thaa	no its ugly and a little creepy...<br>  the only reason ppl would buy that is cuz they want some marc jacobs but don't want to spend much on something actually cute...<br>  i might be generlizing a bit but thats my opinion.|`|9mKunwmMaa	I like all of it other then the dress. they could have made they girl less gothic looking|`|oNlLKAWFaa	I love it. If i had the money i would buy many things from that collection.|`|hH4WUq5Naa	As my Uncle george used to say, "dem girls iz slu*TS"|`|R6Z8onywaa	its kitschy its cute for an accesory here and there|`|QpRNYWcyaa	I like it alot!
S9LnYqzLaa	I have the same color eyes skin and hair so this is what I do. I have Clinique makeup but you don't have to use that. I use a goldish eye shadow that blends in well with my skin yet still looks pretty. I dont use eyeliner but I think if you just use a black eyeliner it would be good. I use light pinkish blush and it really pulls out the color of my hair. I hope this helps! :]|`|p0fqV7BDaa	Use neutral tones, such as browns, pinks, beiges, grays, and BLEND! Blending is key!|`|Mfh3S0dDaa	a nice light gray with blues will look great on you. black eyeliner. and a nice medium peachy pink blush|`|biuRsBL5aa	dont put so much on.<br>  <br>  and also, go with how your face already is... so like put blush on where you would normally blush... and closely follow the shape of your eyes when putting on liner.<br>  <br>  use all kinds of skin-tone makeup, no bright colors.
vWOuX1d5aa	First answer was SO mean ..<br>  God hate nobody ! <br>  <br>  Learn to love yourself. The ONLY way .|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	i doubt its really ugly<br>  just you think so<br>  i bet everyone else thinks you have a super cute smile<br>  people tend to be wayy over critical of themselves<br>  and the imperfections they hate<br>  other people will never even see <br>  so your ok i bet you have a cute smile (:|`|D1UKyUeTaa	Everyone thinks they are ugly, because everyone looks so different.|`|HeVXAjwMaa	Smiling is never ugly :D
eVPW1dwOaa	I think since it's unisex the arms will be longer to accommodate men's longer arms. The girl in the pic's sleeves are really bunchy and shes probably wearing at least a small.|`|VenYUtH6aa	with american apparel i STRONGLY urge you to go into the store to try it on. I'm normally a medium but since its unisex I have to go small and sometimes extra small depending on the item.|`|83419326a8e663feecc64bea718f1bc0aa	I have a similar cardigan from American Apparel but not the same one. Usually American Apparel cardigans sleeves are a bit to long but just right.|`|oNlLKAWFaa	I think if anything the sleeves would be a little long. I would not worry about them being too short at all.
u5c8eS9gaa	I am usually able to find some pretty cool ones in the vision center at my local wal-mart. If your wal-mart dose not have a vision center then try searching the internet.|`|VenYUtH6aa	I found a red one that has lady bugs on it and I think I got it at Rite-Aid.|`|IiML4zYpaa	Wal-mart.! :D You could also try walgreens and drug stores(:
sg6JieT8aa	they don't use lead much anymore except with dollar store items and/or magnets. (the ones you throw up in the air and they make that cool sound and stick together) ummmmm you could chek the label. if they are not like real gold or silver, the label may say "hiper allergenic" or "sterling silver" that is all I know, this way you don't have to buy anything. research the product on google and see what they are made out of. hope I helped.<br>  piper|`|8jY4JUw7aa	order a lead tester kit
dHkvVlONaa	Micro dermal anchors are smaller than regular dermal anchors, hence the 'micro.'   Don't worry i didn't know what the difference was wither till someone explained it too me :)|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Dermal anchors and microdermals are the exact same thing.<br>  It's a surface piercing. <br>  And they are intended to be permanent.<br>  But if for some reason you need or want it removed you need to go to your piercer or doctor to have it removed.<br>  So think about where your gonna get one if you ever do decide to get a dermal anchor.And go to someone who has experience in dermal anchors.
wUIJSSJlaa	It looks like they are just tucked behind the tongue of her shoes...not sure what youre talking about.|`|kZYEXGZzaa	i dont get it.|`|4ZJBzrK3aa	roll up the ends and have the tongue on your sneakers sticking out over your pants?|`|g5m3V7iqaa	You tuck ur pants into ur shoes
3mXMwi9daa	my hair is wavy, i like to wear it like that in the summer :)|`|JTwq9z2jaa	My hair is naturally wavy.<br>  But i don't like it so much.<br>  So i usually straightin it and it looks amazing.<br>  lol.<br>  But yah.<br>  :]|`|lWXvCRcQaa	My hair is naturally straight. Lots of people say my hair is cute down and straight, but I would prefer that I have crinkled hair down.|`|zjZvJJLpaa	mines really curly, but not exactly kinky. Its very taylor swift-ish but brown.|`|6sBn3l3Maa	Mine is natural Straight. <br>  I like it straight so I don't curl it.|`|p0fqV7BDaa	My hair is wavy and curly :)|`|iWmU3fSWaa	my hair is straight :]<br>  but it scrunches, curls and styles really easy...so no matter how i put it it looks natural! :]|`|DfDss68haa	I have kinky curly hair like Esperanzas Spalding's:<br>  <a href="http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/artists/images/esperanza_artist2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/artists...</a><br>  <br>  And I rock it naturally not straightened or relaxed.|`|7OCffobCaa	Curly!!!|`|VEqDtXXoaa	It's in between wavy and curly. Some days it's really curly and other days it's almost straight. So it just depends! But mostly wavy/curly.|`|7i6VV9Obaa	My hair was uber straight when I was little, like, it took FOREVER to curl, but now it's kind of wavy-ish, it depends how I dry it.|`|7sb7QqAEaa	Mines very very curly and has the texture that most black women have even though I'm white.<br>  <br>  I relax and straighten my hair though!|`|Lpc2aAzRaa	my hair used to be soooooo straight,. now days its more wavy that straight, either way i love both hair do's as long as it looks and feel healthy :-)
AA12297189	Hmmm, I lurve it when a girl wears heels cos it's mega feminine and sexy and so on etc....<br>  <br>  But....I have heard enough high-heel shoe drama from ladies to know they can often cause you pain and potentially ruin a night out for you.  <br>  <br>  I'd rather a friend/gf/family member/cross-dressing mate wore what made them feel most comfortable and didn't risk spoiling their night out, or end up smashing some poor innocent boy's nose in. :S<br>  <br>  Guys don't often look at the shoes, I hate to say.  Sad but true.  You might as well be comfortable, eh?<br>  <br>  To paraphrase Moran Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption - "Seriously, how often do you look at someone's shoes?''|`|GWfl2elyaa	I prefer heels because it's common for girls to wear heels than flats. Also women loves to have height advantage.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	heres an idea<br>  2 or 3 inch heels|`|4n6yhUbyaa	flats!!!! well converse but that wasn't a option|`|RA5ziwKyaa	they're honestly both really cute.  If your feet hurt, wear flats its not worth the pain because flats are still cute.  I personally wear flats over heels but I'm also 5'6 and feel too tall to wear heels... Flats are really cute with skinny jeans :)|`|p0fqV7BDaa	A lower, wider heel will still lengthen your leg, while spreading out your weight, giving you more time in those heels!|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Heels but maybe instead of 4.5 inches something lower? Or if you find some cute flats. =)|`|FGfl9tqdaa	flats most of the time, but heels are cute on special occassions.|`|QvoxSyEvaa	I say heels, but perhaps a lower heel?  still cute but less painful and daring|`|sg0m6LBRaa	flatss.<br>  they give it the chic look :D|`|9TAHh7tjaa	well i would say which ever looks better with what you are wearing<br>  <br>  if you do bring a purse wherever your gonna go and you wanna wear the heels, put the flats in your bag<br>  <br>  otherwise i would say flats cause i like em
4n6yhUbyaa	no i dont think so|`|chuNwSTtaa	call your local goodwill and ask|`|blmRX9bwaa	Almost all charity or second hand shops will dry clean or wash clothes before they are sold due to cleanliness and health concerns. I know this is the case in the UK, not sure about in America, but I imagine it's the same! You could phone the store or head office to ask and get a definite answer though.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	No.  A friend of mine did community service there after a DUI.  They just hang them up.<br>  <br>  I went to a St. Vincent de Paul once and tried on some shorts.  There was 35 cents in change in one of the pockets - and a dirty tissue in the other.
nfEdqqsnaa	I don't think it would look amazing...but you could try it.<br>  I think going just a shade lighter would look good on you! :)|`|lKE1ObbXaa	hey ashh :)<br>  i think you would look good with dark dark reddish brown hair :)<br>  <br>  hehe byee! see you tomorrow!<br>  CHESS CLUB!<br>  <br>  btw that pic of you is FIERCE|`|2MoU921aaa	NOOO wayy your skin looks brown , you'll look ridiculous. Please don't do it lol<br>  <br>  Are you a boy because if you cut your hair shorter it wouldn't ook as bad but no brown is better|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	Doubtful. Your skin tones aren't quite right. It would just look odd!|`|VsBmo0MEaa	No way, try blonde. but red hair wouldnt look good|`|FwpIVRxTaa	it will be ok but i like ur hair better|`|Z2pmfQREaa	no no no that will look awful<br>  i think this colour will look great on u<br>  <a href="http://www.alarab.co.il/pics/1/3emran12080208.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.alarab.co.il/pics/1/3emran120...</a>
fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	I think a lot depends on your hair color before you bleached it.  Unless it came out completely colorless (hard to do) then it really is just a crap shoot.|`|yo0qnedIaa	If you bleach it then die it ash brown it will come out ash brown.|`|WpgEqGrvaa	I have quite dark hair and just dyed it medium ash brown.<br>  You don't need to bleach it first if you want it to be a permanent colour. <br>  Find somewhere that sells hair dye in the numbered boxes (not the one that sells them by the colour). You can tell 'cause they will have rows of shelfs with little boxes that have numbers on the front. I went to HairHouse WareHouse in Australia.<br>  Then ask to see the colour chart. It's a book that shows all the different colours and the exact number hair dye to buy. Go for an Ash Brown that is one shade lighter than the one you want, I got 7.32 but it might depend on the brand what number it is. Then you also need a bottle of peroxide. The person in the store should be able to help you and tell you what vol peroxide to use, I used 20vol.<br>  You also need a bowl and a little brush that looks like a paint brush.<br>  When you get home mix equal parts of dye and peroxide according to the instructions on the hair dye box.<br>  Start by covering your roots and then spread the dye all  over your hair.<br>  They normally need about 45 minutes on before washing it off.<br>  And voila, medium ash brown hair :D<br>  <br>  If you have already bleached your hair then I recommend talking to a hairdresser, putting colour over the top can be disastrous, especially if you haven't got ALL the colour out of you hair with the bleach.|`|nP8OQCq9aa	on the hair dye box itself shows u the results of the color  you will get based on the current hair color u have, i know the L'Oreal  ones always show, or if u go to there site they ask you few questions and tell u what is the best shade to get based on your current hair color.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	You answered you own Q. Medium Ash Brown.<br>  Check out the box and consider your bleached hair will be "light blond" to compare the pictures.|`|aGYsSPGoaa	it might be a little darker<br>  go to sallys they can help or any garnier frutis box dye will work maybe leave it in a little longer
Jteqao3zaa	i really like sunsilk's volumizing shampo and conditioner,   my hair is very shiny and manageable, it adds some texture.<br>  i also like thermasilk's volume conditioner, but only if i plan on blow drying my hair.<br>  dove makes a couple good ones for days when you want something very gentle.<br>  oh, i almost forgot, paul mitchell makes a detanglr that i looove, it has carrot extract in it, its super light, but kinda pricey<br>  <br>  the ones i don't like are -  pantene (even though i love the smooth and sleek, and the clean one),  i hate aussie shampoos, left my hair dull and dark.<br>  <br>  at some point i stopped bothering with the volume ones, cuz my hair is thin no matter what.  i usually pick things that are to add shine, and sllekness, if i have to have thin hair it might as well be soft and shiny.
TJTB6PJhaa	Um, no?<br>  Long legs equals hotness. Lol.|`|4ZJBzrK3aa	You won't look weird!  I mean..you can't help if you got long legs or not!|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Usually long legs are great, just make sure your hemline and shoes are appropriate... Ie the shorter the leg, the lower the shoe.<br>  <br>  If your legs are blemish free then bare those puppies with pride, if you have a couple odd veins etc, consider body makeup. Sally Hansens makes a version just for legs. It's pretty sheer and doesn't rub off too easy.|`|T9SgDca8aa	just get a little tan. You know a girl with long legs is really attractive to a guy.|`|Fw9V0mJmaa	well u can get a tan and duh u can wear shorts and skinney jeans would look great on u!!|`|lGIL36faaa	yeh try it and ask u're friends 4 advise|`|vOJGXmKdaa	No it wont look bad if you wear shorts.<br>  Im just about that height, skinny, and pale too lol<br>  But it doesnt look wierd when i wear shorts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArdCLnpYeq79nvTLdCuV29fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302183033AAxcohi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|SQLfPz1Zaa	i dont think so, i know some people who have long skinny, i mean very skinny legs and they still were some pretty short shorts and they look fine.|`|hH4WUq5Naa	I think my great aunt Penny said it best: "A lost ball can go a long way."

I use it all the time, it lasts about 5-6 hours.|`|bnoWoxi0aa	I love the areopostale perfum & fantasy by Brittney spears|`|pidBv0n0aa	uuuummmmm i would have to say Princess wang<br>  pink- Victoria's secret|`|nfTympO4aa	Where i come from, perfume on girls = (********) well, lets just say its bad.

It smells sweet and the guys will love u
UBmxjdGkaa	Well think about it,<br>  <br>  Models are hired/paid to show off clothing/makeup/designs. The person hiring the model would want the model to look presentable as possible, right? So technically, you have to have some sort of beauty or at least uniqueness to be chosen among the other girls. <br>  <br>  They usually look for height and I guess body shape. For girls, breasts too, no A cups but no DD cups either. Tall and curvy people do appeal more. <br>  <br>  But think about it, do you really want to be a model? It might seem fun with all the glamor and press, but really it's not that much of a good career.

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yes it will grow back thick|`|tgJyb7Dnaa	Hair Loss Solution<br>  <br>  If you are losing your hair, you know that the process doesn't simply affect the way you look; it can also affect the way you feel about yourself. If you are interested in slowing down the results of male pattern baldness and stimulating new hair growth, then you're ready for the amazing results of Provillus.<br>  <br>  The majority of products on the market make use of a variety of chemicals that can have harmful side effects and actually cause damage to your hair and scalp. Moreover, most of these chemicals are inconsistent at best when it comes to stopping hair loss. Provillus, a safe and all-natural hair loss solution, blocks the hormone DHT, which has been linked to 95 percent of hair loss. It also provides your scalp with nutrients that are essential to stimulating hair growth.<br>  <br>  Saw palmetto, an essential active ingredient in Provillus, is one of the few natural substances that have been approved by the FDA for use in hair loss programs. When you use our hair loss supplements, the saw palmetto will lower DHT levels by blocking receptor sites on cell membranes. As DHT levels subside, hair loss will subside as well.<br>  <br>  Along with saw palmetto, Provillus utilizes vitamins such as B6 and natural extracts that provide your scalp and hair follicles with vital nutrients. This means that you will not only keep the hair you have, you can actually gain back some of the hair you have lost! The process is easy and effective. We have had so much success with our product that we are willing to give you a money back guarantee when you order. Why wait another day when you can have healthy hair with Provillus?<br>  <br>  For more information visit: <a href="http://1goodhealth.com/gothair/" rel="nofollow">http://1goodhealth.com/gothair/</a>|`|vut2ZCApaa	your hair will grow back to the way it was before. you just need to give it time. and, about the grease in your hair. you can actually stimulate your hair to produce more oils from rubbing of the scalp, and those sorts of things. maybe you've been doing that?|`|Kdt72cABaa	mhm. your hair will be as full as it was before you thinned it. you just cut out some of it, which has nothing to do with what's growing. & about the greasyness, idk. sorry bud. hope you get your volume back soon. :]|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	Don't worry, if your hair is naturally thick, that's the way it will grow in.

793RNStWaa	Depends on the size and tightness of the curl you want.  Have you ever considered a perm?  I prefer a spiral perm.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, there are the ever-traditional rollers.  Some are soft sponge, and some are velcro.  The Velcro ones are great because they are hollow and you put them in while your hair is wet, then just blowdry.  Take them out and your hair is better than straight.  Don't expect a super tight curl though.  To get that, you should wash your hair the night before, use spiral rods, or rollers and sleep in them.  Not the most comfortable thing in the world but it does work.  No drying or curling irons involved.<br>  <br>  You can also try hot rollers.|`|1feDwHtBaa	Try braiding your hair and leaving it over night and then undoing the braids the next morning.

6X2XLVblaa	Yes it hurts, but it all depends on your pain tolerance and weight. I wouldn't take any type of pain killer, what's the point of getting the tattoo if you're not willing to go through the process of it. That's part of getting a tattoo, it means more. If you must take something only take a pill, and DO NOT overdose or take more than needed. Do not drink because it makes it very hard to stop the bleeding.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I have a rib piece im a 19 yr old female height 5'3 and weight is 110lbs if i can take it anyone can. I wouldn't recommend taking any pain killer the point of a tattoo is to feel the pain and if you are too scared to feel it maybe you shouldn't get the tattoo.|`|DjFjLilKaa	yah it will help but dont smoke weed or drink obviously .. taking pills is the only thing that will help the pain
bAYVSfdJaa	Wear a ring or some type of bracelet or watch that you can play with instead of your piercing.  Or, get a Rubicks cube or a puzzle.|`|Axi9yDabaa	Handcuff your hands behind your back if it gets that serious.|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	-cover the piercing? <br>  -keep your hands busy with typing, cooking, reading, ect...
wxil7JB8aa	you can't convince her but know that you are your own worst enemy and it looks way worse to you than anyone else. ask her if you can at least pluck the stray hairs that are not in your eyebrow's natural shape (below)....you won't screw up those and you won't be changing the shape of your eyebrow.|`|S893zUrsaa	I'd say do it yourself a little at a time---she probably won't notice a few hairs gone every day & if you've never plucked before it will be less painful that way.  Only pluck hairs that are strays, if you stay within your natural brow's shape and do a little at a time you probably won't screw up & she probably won't notice!|`|cB5hEv07aa	tell her that all everyone at your school has their eyebrows plucked..<br>  worked with my momm.. =)<br>  good luck|`|FBuGQUrUaa	you are only 11!!! ask when you turn 13.|`|UstazcDFaa	tell your mom if you want people to think dat u dont take care of your self<br>  come on man<br>  but if she still want your eyebrows bushy then get bangs<br>  <br>  <br>  oooo n tell her that with the bushy eyebrowns that you dont feel pretty enough|`|b9MSOr6laa	take a piec of tape and drag it along your eyebrow going outwards. it will make them less bushy.|`|EW1yumzNaa	Well, if you get them done, they wax them, they dont just pluck them. Just tell her that they drive you crazy and your very self concious, and its affecting your self esteem, also tell her that youll pay for them yourself its about 20-25 bucks.
TKf6z1vHaa	If you are planning on dying your hair blonde, then yes the only way to get it died that color is by dying it blonde (bleaching) it. If you wanted to go darker there are alternative methods to use. Also if you want to experiment with blonde hair color, you can try getting clip in extensions or something.|`|JRRsjByCaa	no. that was a dumb question.|`|8DeRuAmYaa	speak english|`|2L3lpRiqaa	well you can soak your hair in Hydrogen Peroxide and then sit in the sun for like 4 hours<br>  that gets your hair super blonde<br>  be sure to rinse out well though<br>  <br>  you could also use lemon juice and sit in the sun but that only gives you hilights<br>  <br>  honestly, this question makes very little sense|`|rGci1ehoaa	are you asking how you can bleach your hair without dying it?? Hmm only product that comes to mind is "Sun In" you spray it on your hair and sit int the sun and it lightens it...|`|p0fqV7BDaa	Bleaching and dying are completely different things!|`|aGYsSPGoaa	first of al<br>  bleach means lighten<br>  <br>  dyed means make it darker.<br>  <br>  second of all<br>  there is no way except maybe use sun in. you can purchase it in any grocery store|`|jmlezFuYaa	i don't know but i know there is another possible way you could have wrote this for it to make sense|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	this question makes no sense
rGci1ehoaa	you DONT!! it will just wash off. If you want a tan without tanning buy some jergens natural glow body lotion.. its a really good moisturizer and it gives you a tan after using it for a week.. cheap too like 5-6 bucks for a big bottle.

jNw8AUzUaa	opposite of fringe.<br>  you are super pretty :)<br>  good luck!<br>  just to let you know, you might want to start out with a stud. they look weird but they're less of a hassle. watch out for the back getting caught in your teeth though (while eating)<br>  it hurts like a b*tch! haha|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	I think they look terrible. You're a pretty girl and you just messed up your looks with that thing. Take it out and let the hole close up.|`|tGf48z8Maa	i say wear the lipring on the right side of your lip a.k.a the picture on the left lol.|`|jH2NZTCuaa	left side, looks so much cuter.|`|KBN0vR28aa	left !! its gna look soo good on u|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	Left side definately.<br>  Hope your not planning on wearing a hideous ring, studs look much better.|`|yo0qnedIaa	The side your bangs arent swept too.<br>  Piercing looks good on you.<br>  <br>  ANNDDD, I love your hair.<br>  <br>  xD|`|8UozWw0Paa	well, whatever way your fringe goes, the opposite side for your piercing.<br>  i don't know why, it's sort of symertical/balanced out.<br>  <br>  e.g., fringe to the left, piercing on the right of lip.|`|B3cPFhssaa	Right side,because your hair is parted to the left.<br>  Wait,i'm lost - you mean my left and right,or the left and right when you took it?<br>  <br>  Alright,the opposite side to your fringe.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	the first pic. your left. it looks better on that side.|`|xEZclTh4aa	well if you're getting any other piercings then get it on the opposite side of that piercing <br>  if not then get it opposite of your fringe <br>  you would look really cute with one :]]
GqVaHA7Iaa	prefer the mizani line to the retail brands, or even affirm but both are generally only sold to professional, but you can order them online and sometimes find them in the beauty supply inside the counter. <br>  Your hair will be relaxed forever once you do it, but the amount of new growth or how regularly you will have to retouch depends on how fast your hair grow.  Even though you claim your hair is thick, don't automatically reach for a super, start with a regular, let it sit as long as you can take it and if you're not satisfied with the straightness then retouch after the 6 weeks with a super.<br>  Out of retail brands I prefer Motions though. Used Hawaiian silky back in the day but if I had no access to the professional brands I'd stick with motions.|`|GKwgS5pYaa	My roommate uses Mizani and her hair looks AMAZING|`|Lv0wvXSzaa	dudleys, optimum for thick hair.<br>  <br>  once mine has had one of those, i can use precise|`|pcLOOgyqaa	old women  like our parents and grand parents use to say that oil message definitely helps to relax. hope this will help u too<br>  all the best
AA10238113	Side bangs are parted down the middle and the left flows down and the right flows down on it's respective side of the face.<br>  <br>  Side swept bangs are bangs that are flowing downward and forward but the bottom is swept either to the left or right side and can sometimes be tucked behind the ear.
uij93NOjaa	Yes!! Side bangs would look so cute on you, it will add  some texture to your hair! Make sure when you go get it done to tell them you don't want them too short because a longer side bang would look better. Also, I would suggest  putting in some more layers (face layers) It will add a little extra something to your hair, instead of having it be so flat.|`|OSD5by7Oaa	you should totally get side bangs!<br>  They would look great on you!|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	yah i think it will look good on u. u cute BTW :)|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	My niece has long straight hair, and she throws it all over one shoulder. It looks really good on her, but she is kind of sassy. I think she parts it on the left and throws it over the right shoulder, or something like that. (It's been a while since I have seen her.) It gets in her eyes a lot but looks really good. Experiment with that a few times and see if you find a good look.|`|3Vmd2KYTaa	Yes, you would definitely look good with side bangs!|`|a0MOldiYaa	your sooo pretty (: xx...<br>  <br>  and yeah the bangs would look hott on you :P xx ahah ! xx<br>  <br>  <br>  niicee daay hunn !(: xx|`|LfnQU9abaa	yes|`|MuBrEem1aa	Well I think the bangs look good on you!!!<br>  And I think you could trim your hair to give it strength and just by trimming it you are not shorthening it that much!!!<br>  <br>  Then I think you could cut some cute layers they are totally in right now and maybe you could add some auburn lights that go off after six months or permanent if that's ok with your parents!!!<br>  <br>  Well I hope this helps!!!!And I hope you'll look great after the haircut!!!|`|asM2jBAjaa	I think you should get thicker bangs with layers like this: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://khairilhusni.blogmas.com/files/2008/10/ashley-tisdale-picture-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://khairilhusni.blogmas.com/files/20...</a><br>  <br>  And btw your pretty! im sure you would look great with anything|`|inMfHLWoaa	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/themarilynhowmuch/2516644953/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/themarilynh...</a><br>  <br>  MAybe...|`|BV7ZRKpUaa	ooh yeah keep your length, get tons of choppy layers and side bangs! those bangs would look good yes but i would make them a little shorter like maybe the end at the corner of your eye?<br>  btw your really pretty :)|`|C3XX5WWSaa	Keep your hair, it's cuter.|`|R3DxlK0xaa	I vote yes!! You have the perfect face for that look.|`|lYaFaHxWaa	I personally believe than. naturally tan girls look good with bangs high five.|`|NjgvHbcYaa	this is just my opinion but i think you would look great
AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist, and I work for Mac.<br>  <br>  Mineralize SkinFinish comes in two different finishes..matte and frosty. I'm assuming you have the matte one. You can use the SkinFinish all over your face, or you can use it like a sculpting powder (if it's a dark shade) to contour. It's not as great as a contour, Mac Pro sells an actual contour powder, but their brown blushes (such as Harmony) are perfect for contouring. <br>  <br>  I happen to prefer Studio Fix powder as an all-over face powder to set makeup, but the SkinFinish is nice because it is sheer and lightweight. Now if you are using the frosty SkinFinish, you should be using it as a highlighter on the cheekbones, using it all over the face will leave you with a glowy look, which may be bad if you have oilier skin.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|0zv9NHnaaa	i put it on my full face;; so yeah..<br>  <br>  -Jo(:

What should I change about it?  You have a lot of grammar errors, copy & paste the text into word and fix it then put it back :]  And I think you should offer more topics, and for that part where you gave the girl's site that you commented on talking about this other girl, I think you should take that down.  More trouble...Your topics are too common make some different ones!! [Ex: Fashion, Career Choice, School/Grades]<br>  6. Anything else you want to say about it.<br>  Umm for some reason you sound a little vain when you keep talking about how popular you are now..and I think you should include more personal stories to make it more interesting xD|`|BC0mPUJhaa	2 points

In many women this causes odd breast shapes or appearances for a little while until all the skin, fat cells and glands have grown equally. The most common form this takes is one breast being noticeably larger than the other, whilst very few women are ever symmetrical (at least naturally) it can be much more noticeable in puberty.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like this is a normal stage in the formation of tissue on the nipple, however if you are worried about it, or if it doesn't settle down, go see your doctor. Doctors are very used to seeing people with all sorts of worries and embarrassing problems, there isn't a person alive who will have a doctor put their fingers where the sun doesn't shine at some point in their lifetime! So don't worry and get it checked out!<br>  <br>  Good Luck :D|`|NYk8wHmraa	uhhh i have no idea! go to the doctors!

kYDjjVpJaa	I hate to have to tell you this, but dying your hair and going grey have nothing to do with each other.  My sister is 40 and has never colored her hair once.  She started going grey in her 20's. She is 50% grey. I've colored my hair since I was 13. I'm now 36. I started going grey in my 20's. For the most part grey hair is hereditary.  Lifestyle does play a part in it, but not coloring your hair isn't going to hold it off.|`|9qMCCQI4aa	ummm no... colouring your hair has nothing to do with how fast you go grey. going grey is a biological thing.. colouring your hair is a chemistry thing and doesnt affect your hair folicle at all.

QTyOmk1Naa	You will need to identify your eyecolor for this.<br>  <br>  For Brown Eyes<br>  Apply gray or brown eyeliner under bottom lashes in small dots. <br>  Use finger to rub the eyeliner under your eye and do the same to the other. <br>  You can do the same on top but don't apply inside the lid...if you want it to look natural that is. <br>  Apply mascara and avoid clumps but using tissue to wipe off excess from the wand. <br>  Put some light blush/bronzer on cheeks. <br>  For lips use sheer pinks,nudes,or clear. Only apply lipstick on nude colors. <br>  <br>  For Green or Hazel Eyes<br>  Do steps 1-4 from previous but this time you can use light brown eyeshadow. <br>  For cheeks use light pink or an orange shade. <br>  Apply nude lip gloss or lipstick. <br>  <br>  For Blue Eyes<br>  Use gray eyeliner inside the lid and under lower lashes. Apply liner under lower lashes in dots and rub to make it look natural. <br>  Put on mascara. <br>  Use pink blush on cheeks. <br>  Apply a clear coat of lip gloss<br>  <br>  <br>  Other Info:<br>  **By natural looking makeup, I think you would be interested by the Romantic Valentine Look, by MichellePhan on Youtube.<br>  <br>  **I should have said this way earlier, but before you apply any sort of makeup, you want to have your face totally clean. Gently wash your face with a quality face wash or gentle soap (like Dove). Cleanse around your eyes very well with warm water. <br>  <br>  **After cleaning your face, pat your face dry with a towel and moisturize it all over. You want to use a quality lotion that hydrates your skin without leaving an oily residue on top. You want the makeup to last the whole date, and your skin needs to be prepped for that. I use "Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Cool & Fresh, Light Moisturizing Lotion." Here's the link: <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp140094_333181_sespider/vaseline_intensive_care/aloe_cool_and_fresh_light_moisturizing_lotion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp140094_33318...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbEB9T-iUA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbEB9T-i...</a><br>  Watch it. It is an excellent video tutorial that can really help you. Whenever you need makeup help, watch her videos. She is the only makeup person on YouTube that I would consider 100% reliable for makeup.<br>  <br>  **Remember, you shouldn't rely on makeup to look beautiful. The purpose of makeup is to bring out your assets and make your flaws less noticeable. Every girl/woman is beautiful.<br>  <br>  **For a natural look, you want to use minimal amounts of everything. Make sure to do whatever is possible to brighten your eyes. Some say that the eyes are the window to one's soul, and on a date, this would be particularly important. It's more important to be a beautiful person on the inside than the outside, but ****, you want to look good anyway.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|SgtvDDcjaa	Yes of course you can.<br>  But you may want to consider your outfit, hair, location of the date, and length. These will all affect your choice.|`|ITsISXsBaa	yes|`|YQRbtyGVaa	coverup-some foundation that maetches you skin tone.. i use maybelline dream matte mousee. its really light and makes skin look flawless, light pink blush, swipe of bronzer<br>  eyes- brown eyeliner go across the top but on the bottom do only the outside of the eye..gold eyeshadow , but add a little brown on the outside of the brow.. couple swipes of mascara<br>  lips- keep it simple with just light light pink gloss<br>   eyes are the prettiest so draw attention to those<br>  it seems like a lot but if you do just a little of everything it looks really natural|`|iy2Vcgfmaa	Yes, you can apply natural looking makeup. <br>  <br>  But if you mean how? then just use a little mascara and blush. then maybe some eyeshadow that is close to your skintone.

I think if you gained a stone you'd fit into a UK size 6 or 8.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|QITDf0IEaa	How much do you weigh currently?<br>  <br>  Make your goal to eat 6 times a day. breakfast, mid morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, a snack before bed. Build up to it and don't think junk food is a quick way because sometimes it just doesn't work for some people (I practically lived on junk food for most of my teen years and it never made me gain any weight)<br>  <br>  You need to consume more calories than usual. <br>  <br>  Have an extra calorie milkshake 1-2 times daily.<br>  <br>  Eat things like: nuts, meat, rice, pasta, potatoes, dairy products.<br>  <br>  Check your weight every week to see if there is an improvement. If not, go to your doctor and see if he/she can help you. You might have an intolerance to some food groups.

dIS08i1oaa	I agree with Blanche.<br>  The only term close to "Triple X Cut" in the diamond industry is "AGS Triple Zero".<br>  <br>  If it is an AGS000 diamond it will be rare, beautiful and brilliant.<br>  <br>  Make sure the diamond is certified by American Gem Society.<br>  At the bottom of the following link, you can download a .pdf document of what an actual AGS certificate looks like:|`|xjazE0xmaa	Perhaps the salesman was refering to the "Triple 0" cut.  It's standard in the jewelry trade to refer to an ideal-cut (AGS graded) diamond as "triple 0" cut, since the score sheet provides a "0" in the three cut categories of polish, symmetry, and proportions.  <br>  <br>  While it's good to see an ideally cut diamond, I suggest two things:<br>  1) Make sure his "triple x" is the same as what most people call a "triple 0" (or "ideal AGS").<br>  2) Review the diamond's other specs in case this beautifully cut diamond has problems with color, clarity, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

And as they are sold to a wide variety of customers, they are very limited to help you with your personal acne problems. You should consider going to a dermatologist, as they are good in the field of skin care, they would know exactly what lotions/medicine would help with that. They're kinda expensive, but well worth it if you really want this acne to go away.<br>  <br>  There's more to just products though, a healthy routine really helps. You could start by washing your face every morning with a light cleanser, and not touching your face unless you've washed your hands. And as tempting as it might be, don't wear too much makeup. It DOES damage your skin, and some people get acne from it. Fruits and Veggies are also essential, and limit yourself to junk food. <br>  <br>  As for the flaky part, I also suggest the skin doctor, but depending on how severe it is, you could do something. Try rubbing Vaseline on it, it makes your skin soft afterwards too.|`|jH2NZTCuaa	If you have a big red, puffy whitehead,<br>  Take a potato, and cut a small slice.<br>  Wet it a little bit, then lay down with it on the pimple for about 5-8 <br>  minutes.

kYDjjVpJaa	I am not familiar with the product you are talking about, but it doesn't sound like something the average person should be trying by themselves at home.  If you want to lift the black/ brown and go lighter you really should go to a salon.  I can't stress this enough.  Please go to a salon.
Rcs1X5Zeaa	Of course they do! It's completely normal. Well permanently is a lot harder then just temporarily, you can wax or just pluck it. But if you want permanently you'll have to go with laser and it's a lot costlier and it takes way more time. ;)|`|7fGG81bfaa	WOAHHHH they shaved your head?

I have seen some girls that look like they just drew a line across their brow. Take the time to make it look like little hairs in a proper arch and use the proper makeup. Also, some women do this but miss the natural space for the brow. The brows drawn do not move with the person's facial expressions and it looks odd. Some girls also make the mistake of drawing too strong of an arch and they looked surprised all the time. It is best to begin the brow at a slight angle from the inner corner of the eye and the center of the arch should be over the pupil of the eye. The end of the eye brow should be just past the corner of the eye, at the same angle as the start of the brow. Many stores even sell stencils to get the right shape. If you approach it right, there shouldn't be a problem. Many women have no choice but draw in their brows because they have over-tweezed and the hair won't grow back or their own brows are too sparse to achieve the look they are trying to achieve.|`|x37JGCzSaa	No...don't shave your eyebrows off! It's a hassle to have a little bit keep growing back and make it look good. Besides, drawing on eyebrows?

aXqtzNIraa	It's too soon to change it especially since you mentioned it fell out once already!<br>  <br>  Approximately time is 6- 10 weeks but can be quicker, I think you should wait longer with it only be 2 weeks since being pierced though.<br>  <br>  If you change it now, the changes of infection will be greater so it's worth the wait. <br>  <br>  Once it's healed properly you can change from labret to ring, if you change over it might be tricky at first to get the different jewellery in since the shape of the hole will be that of the jewellery you were pierced with but it'll be fine|`|8jY4JUw7aa	ur weight  time is up|`|6uYVRaebaa	you can change it, i wound recommend using jewelery without the external screws? but if you don't have one you can just lubricate whatever you have and stick it in. Just don't change it too many times you could re-open it and it'll get infected.

Tu0wXDISaa	Well, the possibilities are endless for this full sized young man.  You left out major information.  Specific info is need which you didn't provide, to achieve an approrpriate look for a plus size man.  What is his age, does he want a tailored look, cuffs, necktie or bow tie?  Let me help you out a bit.  Since he is 6'3", he would look very handsome in basic black, navy blue (very sexy) the look is pulled together with "accessories", if he wants to coordinate with you, I would suggest a turquoise tie,( (invest in quality) with matching hanky for breast pocket, linen or starched crisp white cotton shirt with "cuff links and matching tie clip"  in silver-toned ....  remember any suit can be pulled together to look very elegant depending on the right coordinating accessories!!!  As for shoes.... leather.  He should consider a professional manicure and have his nailed "buffed" no clear polish please!  If he is a confident man with a great sense of self..... he can invest in an off-white tailored suit.  Go to "Google" and enter Menswear for Big and Tall the stores are greatly listed .....<br>  Happy Easter!  Step out with confidence and a great spirit to workship in Serivce.....|`|Oejricveaa	Maybe something like this...<br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=331989&CategoryID=43264" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  This suit would look nice<br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=288972&CategoryID=35016" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  with this tie...<a href="http://www.solidcolorneckties.com/index.cfm/fa/items.main/parentcat/27575/subcatid/65662/id/364101?gclid=COmZmMyN_ZgCFQECGgodE14Klg" rel="nofollow">http://www.solidcolorneckties.com/index....</a>|`|8jY4JUw7aa	light green or sage color|`|q0CHTn89aa	I would say some slacks and a nice cream or tan button down or polo!  my husband is 6'1" and kinda husky that always looks good on him!

b8190d0f68bcdc2fd6ac4a2c9c009d11aa	Yes, it's fine, because when you get laser hair remove you first even have to shave it bec they need your hair to be thick, anyway they'll tell you exactly what to do when you go there;<br>  good luck!!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|hcEZGk8Caa	Yea it will be fine, I would just grow it back a little bit just in case before you get it lasered off but it should be okay :)
3nroipPyaa	You should go lighter. If your worried of having 2 different colors, then get your hair done at a salon. don't do it yourself if you want good results (that wasn't an insult) also, if you go lighter, you'll have to retouch your roots every 2-3 weeks (that you should do on your own). if you don't like my opinion, see the other results on here :-)|`|p4Hf5vxaaa	I vote second, d00d.<br>  <br>  totally beast<3<br>  <br>  ANSWER MINEE:)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApZ0Fkk39niKqqz7AER13m_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304133903AAL1vO4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8ghkutEfaa	you know what is complicated to answer you by this way.Go and ask to someone who more about hair style is the best for you man.<br>  Don't worry|`|RDL1kBtZaa	I LOVE the second one!

bZxKn3ZUaa	Dresses: make sure they are empire waist and float away from your calves but cinch at the waist or right below the bust<br>  <br>  Jeans: get special jeans made for curvier people.  do a dark wash and make sure there is no fading on the thighs, b/c that would bring attention to your thighs|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	Hockey ,Goalie pads|`|aEGgO5Knaa	Maybe Darla needs a lesson in anatomy. Thighs are where "blubber" can be found, calves are the bottom part of your leg. Theyre usually only "ginormous" due to muscle.|`|MzDWr3wgaa	stay away from skinny jeans.<br>  do they make leg girdles now?<br>  if they do, try that.<br>  but it mite cut off ur circulation.<br>  lol.<br>  but yeah, just wear baggy pants.
utZyz90Waa	I'm bleaching my hair as we speak haha :) It cause quite a bit of damage but if you keep it in good check you can keep it in an alright condition. <br>  <br>  If your pale then I don't think you should go bleach blonde, people with pale skin should go for 'warm' colours than cool ones. Talk to your hairdresser about any longer laster highlights, maybe add a few different shades in to get a better overall colour.|`|s4TMc1vqaa	it would be prettyer if you were tan...|`|TIZOh5Beaa	i have the same type of hair!<br>  <br>  i did it and it turned reddish, but everyone has DIFFERENT hair so try an un noticable part and see what it does

PAvYZJK2aa	when they start high school|`|jf8nrfHZaa	Never. some guys never change and if some do you shouldn't based on everyone else doing it.|`|sXVQBGmWaa	I'm 13 and I wear boxers 100% of the time. I started wearing them at the age of 10. I thought my briefs were to tight and I allways felt uncomfortable. I saw boxers in the shops it said they were loose fit. And I said to my mum can I buy these because I find my current underwear really uncomfortable and she said yes. And from then onwards my mum has been buying boxers for me.|`|tGf48z8Maa	i've found that the guys at my school started to wear boxers all at the same age around 10/11
TjPwxbuJaa	I totally understand. It sounds to me that you want to do it for the right reasons. I have mine both stretched to 1 1/2 inches (38mm) and absolutely love them. I can't imagine not having them, and I feel down when I let them shrink down even a little. They do make me feel more confident about myself and everybody remembers me as well. And I get compliments on them all of the time as well. From both men and women and kids of all ages. I wouldn't have expected that. Furthermore, I have an advanced degree in engineering and earn a very good salary and have been very successful in most aspects of my life. The ears certainly haven't hindered that, and in fact may have helped since they make me feel more confident. The point is that they're not just for "losers" and "layabouts" like your parents likely assume, and you don't have to reverse them when you're older, unless you really want to.<br>  However, I'm not sure of your age, but I could not recommend that you go behind your parents' backs, if you are under 18. Once you are an adult, you are able to make your own decisions -- of course, many decisions come with costs, but that's part of being an adult. I believe that your parents are just wanting you to wait it out to be certain it's something that you really want. I know that my Dad doesn't approve of them, but I'm well past the age of caring what he thinks about such matters.<br>  Best of luck.|`|vYlia8bjaa	Yup yup yup, its easy. Mostly though, you shouldnt care what your parents think. You seem old enough to not have to be controlled by them... If not, you shouldnt be stretching your ears. o_O<br>  I stretched mine at age 13 and by the time i was 15 they were 00g, but I  took them out, now I cant wear normal earings! So remember that your ears wont be completely normal after you do stretch.|`|5NIXNq2haa	How old are you?  You made it sound like your in college but then said HS...<br>  <br>  but either way, it's your body!  You should do what makes you happy and try not to worry about what others think (even your parents).  <br>  <br>  If you're under 18 then you should probably wait I guess, but after that I say do whatever you want to your body to make yourself happy!|`|NYk8wHmraa	why would you want to stretch your ears and get a gage i think thats the most stupidest idea! im supporting your parents! it doesnt look good. and when you get old its gonna look gay! dont do it. it doesnt make you look cool it makes you look retarded!|`|Nupv5Uzlaa	This will NOT make you more attractive, you know this right?
aOFdtoR4aa	WARNING! Don't Even Think About Buying Another Acne Product Until You Read This...|`|3e826f6bfeed8f8fc4f08d95cecf3a14aa	i use rosac-its a prescribed fash wash.<br>  i love it! & i use a gel called epiduo,--it works great, too!<br>  <br>  but like i said it's prescription. <br>  but my face has cleared up great!
Bv3Dm11paa	Your current tattoo sounds way nicer then the one you want to get.|`|kPMQt25Daa	Ya totally you can cover any tattoo with black just in some places u might want to add color if you cant cover your whole old tattoo like putting flowers wrapped around the horseshoe with vines or somthing :)|`|E01GXmQeaa	what doesn't make sense to me is why you want to cover up one bad tattoo with another bad tattoo.<br>  it's hard to tell what's possible and what's not if i don't see what it is and what it looks like. i think you should pick out a good artist who can draw (and it's sad but true that i have to specify this one) and have them freehand something over what you have to ensure maximum coverage and concealing.good luck|`|OXOHoISraa	sure it would if the tattoo would cover the entire area.  You need to consider the negative space in the tattoo needs to be skin colored.<br>  <br>  Just be sure it won't be something you will be regreting in another few years.
TCpTlCTRaa	It's not uncommon for women to shed large amounts of hair during the postpartum period. Once the shedding ends the woman should be left with hair that is only slightly thinner than her pre-pregnancy hair. Unfortunately for some women the hair loss is more severe and long-lasting, resulting in noticeable thinning. Taking excellent care of your physical and emotional health during this period can help the hair growth cycle to resume more easily. Essential oil scalp massage treatments are an excellent natural remedy to  stimulate healthy new growth but certain essential oils cannot be used if you are presently nursing baby,|`|uXFdeKGPaa	many reasons cause it im a sufferer myself until i tried this its for men and women.free trial,good luck|`|uRvO6PBpaa	â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â <br>  <br>  My dad had been suffering from hair loss and only recently he started to see a huge difference with his hair (lots of fine hair growing out especially at the temple area) after trying out the various natural techniques taught to grow hair for 1 week at this website <a href="http://www.regrowmyhair.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.regrowmyhair.info</a> <br>  <br>  I must say its a very informative, effective and easy to follow step-by-step guide.

utZyz90Waa	Use a damaged hair shampoo but not the conditioner, it helps. :) Before you blow dry it though, use a leave in conditioning spray - I use to use it and it helped so much but it ran out and I'm pretty skint haha. Then ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use a heat protection spray before straightening, quite a lot of them nowadays have 'shine-enhancing' products in them so that should help :) Once in a while give your hair a break though, tie your hair up instead of straightening it and use a conditioning mask in your hair for like five minutes. nly do this once a week/once every two weeks. <br>  <br>  hope I helped!|`|cCWTvEZTaa	Well I rinse my hair in cold water, its shiny.|`|U5g6kSa7aa	I use Straightening conditioner, i cant remember the brand i use, but ask your stylist. you put it on after you get out of the shower, before you blowdry. ALSO, do not use a straighter after all the stuff has chipped off the metal, it is SO damaging!|`|CNv6saZuaa	b4 u straiten spary a small mist of hair spary 4 inches away. it will help prevent frizz and static. or use gel. also to make it shiny use mineral oil. dont overdo, or itll look sick greasy and ewwy! only a teeeeeeny bit on a comb, and run i thorugh ur hair after u straiten. then straiten again. remember: dont over do it!|`|qDd84PDpaa	Have you tried hairspraying by the roots? <br>  and bedhead sugarush i thinks it called, is amazing for making <br>  your hair look shiney! ï¿¡15 from shear beauty :)<br>  or any hairdressers.|`|wfBg0bq3aa	Use muse or biosilk it makes it look good, but font mix them togather.|`|agXQ2cAkaa	Try using one of Sunsilk's anti-frizz products. I heard they work pretty well. To make your hair shiny, you should flat iron it, but always remember to use some sort of heat tamer spray before doing so to protect your hair from damage from the heat.
AA10238113	Perms can be fun but can easily go wrong!<br>  I had a perm a few years ago and it added a lot of texture, volume and bounce to my hair. I was very pleased with the results. <br>  <br>  The only downside to getting a perm and that it can dry out and make your hair brittle and break. you just have to keep it extra moisturized. And when it grows out, it will look funny (really straight on top and really curly on the bottom). you're right you will have to keep doing touch-up's.<br>  <br>  <br>  TIP: Try to make it look natural -- if it's to tight or big it can easily be a major faux-pa.<br>  <br>  This is the perfect video from ehow.com -- it's thorough and will help A LOT!<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/video_4408692_what-home-hair-perm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/video_4408692_what-h...</a>|`|AXCV7fNfaa	If you get a perm you'd be AHEAD of the trends!

Don't get one just for the sake of getting one- it's a waste of money because it'll mean nothing to you afterwards. <br>  <br>  Also, I'd recommend getting the tattoo on your back or somewhere else under your clothes where it won't show in most normal clothes. Tattoos, unless you want to work in a tattoo shop or on a construction site, decrease your chances of getting hired for a job.|`|E01GXmQeaa	oh wow why didn't you post this 15 minutes before getting it? you know, it's kind of important, since it's permanent. sooo i'd say decide and then think about making an appointment.|`|1Xkwd0Traa	I would go with LIVE and LET DIE.

Rnq98VJNaa	Wow what kinda of school do you go to? Im not trying to be mean but thats wierd maybe you should ask the superintendent to not have that rule anyways, but i would suggest using clear mascara, eye shadows that are a couple of shades lighter than your skin tone and light brown or brown eyeliner. Hope I helped and Good Luck :)|`|es3feuhxaa	wear a really natural tinted moisturizer for your coverup, some clear mascara and tiny smudge of eyeliner.|`|RUuQ3syDaa	just dont make it obvious that you are wearing it, so wear natural shades like brown and beiges|`|gdGDvWTDaa	nope.  iwent through that.<br>  you sound young so just wait...only use cover up|`|qDd84PDpaa	right make sure you have a foundation the accept same shade as your skin tone, use a natural eyeshadow colour, and a brown eyeliner looks much more natural, also if you apply thin coats of mascara, or just apply to the corners of the eyelash's, opt for a light skin coloured blusher bt just genetly brush it over the cheekbone once or twice, and it should be unnoticeable. stick to natural colours and youll be fine!hope this helps.|`|50eec528d28a6c9e6975ac8b0d604143aa	I would wear some concealer and a very sheer illuminating powder on top.<br>  <br>  Use a brown eyeliner and smudge it away a little bit and for mascara, before you put it on, wipe some of it off on a tissue then apply.<br>  <br>  If you put a little bit itll make your eyes stand out but look as if you just got your eye lashes damp sort of look.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	that sucks!<br>  -chapsick: to keep your lips looking good and 'fresh'<br>  -brown eyeliner: beautiful and natural looking<br>  -clear mascara: it makes your eyelashes look fuller but no colour, so you cant get into trouble for wearing mascara<br>  <br>  hoped i helped! =]|`|LwENi55laa	Wow that's a very strict school.<br>  depending on the type of look you are going for.<br>  If you're going for a sheer, natural look i suggest mascara, and a light brown eyeliner, and a light foundation.|`|biuRsBL5aa	woahhh dude that sucks!! i would die if i went to a school like that.<br>  <br>  what i can suggest is brown eyeliner and mascara. it looks natural, unlike black liner and mascara. <br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|pEccQrcTaa	use a brown eyeliner<br>  with a bit of brown mascara or clear mascara :)|`|fVnb4BpHaa	why dont they allow makeup?|`|Dug6yDOLaa	no makeup?!

I did.<br>  <br>  Skin:<br>  I made sure my skin was as clear as could be, because even if you foundation looks natural, you can tell.  Make sure not too wear too much, or you will get caught.<br>  <br>  Mascara:<br>  Brown.  Try to apply some on both the top and bottom lashes so you don't even have to wear eyeliner, although i will offer an idea.<br>  <br>  Eyeliner:<br>  Eye brightening colors are amazing.  They will add so much color to your eyes, but be totally neutral.  Try a super light brown along your upper and bottom lashes, almost the same color as your skin.<br>  Apply some in the crease too.<br>  Also, apply some dark brown or black in your upper waterline (on top of your eye) <br>  It will make your eyes stand out, and unless your teacher is pulling your eyelind, she/he can't tell<br>  <br>  Go graduale, or everyone will notice!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

p0fqV7BDaa	Correctly blow drying IS directly impacted with heat, girly. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd say straightening is better for your hair, just because blow drying the wrong way can mess with your cuticle. Neither matter though, if you have a good heat protectant! I suggest Iron Silk by Redken.|`|fhVj1fMUaa	idk.. i think blow drying (thts wat i do caus wen i blow dry my hair it becomes straight) i think blow drying caus its not touching ur hair directly with heat...

e9gsf1GJaa	NO!<br>  a 2g is the point of NO return.<br>  they wont close all the way.<br>  a 00g is nothing!<br>  the best size to stop @ is a 3/4<br>  cause then your ears wouldnt be BIG BIG.<br>  [:|`|AA10014641	My friend had 00g and his closed to like a 14g in 3 months. If I take mine out for a couple of days they shrink quite a bit.Mine are at 1/2"|`|b3790303c70cd3c142cbc70e455574e8aa	It not only has to do with how big you stretch your ears, but how flexible your skin is.  I have 6g lobes, and I can keep them out for an hour and they look closed up.  Of course, I have no problems getting my plugs in, the holes just LOOK shrunken.<br>  <br>  A couple general rules:  2g is considered the "point of no return".  It doesn't mean your holes wont shrink any at all if you go past this point, it just means that will not close up completely... no matter how long you go without plugs.  Also, once you venture into the bigger sizes, your ears will probably shrink half the size if you decide you no longer want gauges.  For example, if your ears are 1", expect them to close up to 1/2".<br>  <br>  There are exceptions to the rules, though.  I have a friend who had 5/8" holes and shrunk them all the way to a 10g.  She now wears standard earrings just fine... they just fall out sometimes.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you take care of them while you're stretching... do oil massages, sea salt soaks, and wait the proper amount of time between stretches.  When you decide to downsize, just go without plugs until they're small enough for the next size down.  Keep massaging and soaking in sea salt!  Good luck!

MFKgVsoAaa	i love sandals! well since it's college, you want something comfortable for walking around a lot, so i suggest some knee-length or capri pants. you can get knee-length jeans at charlotte russe, or just find some cute, dark-colored or colorful shorts (get short ones and also knee-length)- the casual look would look super cute with the sandals! also, a nice, casual summer dress with some accessories would look adorable. you can get a nice patterned one to wear with some solid sandals, or maybe just a simple white one that would match with a lot of different jewelry and accessory colors. a mini skirt is another option, or just plain old jeans if it's not too hot for those, pretty much anything works as long as you can make it all work together! hope i helped!|`|qdIERV7faa	jean shorts and flowy tanks|`|r4CJElzvaa	buy a lot of jean skirts that go a little past the thigh or knee length <br>  a lot of tank tops<br>  short sleeve shirts<br>  polos in every color|`|vM4mR94waa	a tank top and min shorts

Good luck!!!!|`|1Onob98Laa	well.. i guess it would be wiser to get it in english because you don't know the prpoer way to say it in french... and u are american...|`|FDgHnvm3aa	personally, i think that for something simple words are played out.  i would suggest doing it in a more obscure language, or if you are a littl ebit of a fantasy weirdo, Elvish from Lord of the rings is really sweet looking|`|pRjYZcSIaa	I think wanting to put it in another language is beautiful, but that's my opinion. You should definitely wait until you're 100% concrete on what you want, YOU'RE the one who has to live with it.|`|43k2ISydaa	english!|`|of049X1waa	allons-y means "let's go" :P haha.<br>  <br>  but let go as in the way you mean it is not the same in french.  you can say "laisser tomber," to let fall, laisser aller, meaning to let go as in to let somehting leave... but it is not the same as in English!!|`|m16OaHBmaa	well in french it says <br>  "laissez vont" i like in french, but make sure you know how to prounce it
oRPvkExwaa	It depends on how long you've had the piercing. If it's new it might shrink so you can't get the jewelry back through, or it might get infected if you mess with it too much. If you've had it for a few months it'll be fine, but if you're still worried get a clear retainer to wear during meets. Just make sure to clean your jewelry every time you put it back in!|`|3e826f6bfeed8f8fc4f08d95cecf3a14aa	if you've had the piercing for more than 6 weeks, it shouldnt.<br>  but if you've had it shorter than that, it most likely would.|`|VYgnpDJpaa	so u sleep with it in?|`|2mX8K8bdaa	It will take about 3 to 4 months for the hole to close.  Just don't wear it at practice or at meets, and you will be fine.|`|vYlia8bjaa	depends on how long you've had it. if it is brand new (like 5 hours old) then it might close up a little bit.<br>  but other than that, no it wont and you will still be able to get the lipring in.

Yes, I know it's prom, the much awaited night for teens but that's more Oscars than high school. <br>  <br>  Yes, I must agree with the people who say that the shorter dress would compliment your height, and the color looks great and red hair ( considering the number of colors that DON'T) With the dress, pair it up with a sleek do and some long, shinny necklaces. <br>  <br>  Have a blast at prom!|`|XhJJNTV8aa	Well I would say the first one.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	In 1980, the author and private schoolâbut not preparatory schoolâalumna Lisa Birnbach edited the Official Preppy Handbook, a tongue-in-cheek guide to what she termed 'prepdom'. Though intended as satire, it is widely adhered to as a guidebook by those who embrace the latter interpretation of preppy fashion. <br>  <br>  An example of preppy attire would be a button down Oxford cloth shirt, an argyle sweater, cuffed chinos, and boat shoes.<br>  <br>  Yup... it's true - I LIVED THROUGH THE 80's  - LMFAO!!! <br>  <br>  Check out the link below - it will give you a full explanation of the whole "preppy" thing that was happening in the 80's.  <br>  <br>  ...oh, ya, besides the clothing, it was also the attitude and the lingo...<br>  <br>  "like gag me with a spoon"<br>  "like omg!"<br>  "like then she said, then like i said..."<br>  <br>  and we all had stupid preppy names like Biff and Bitsy and uggh - it was horrible!!|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	preppy kids at school are usually the ones that hang out with the jocks/cheerleaders and USUALLY(some are actually nice) pretty stuck up to non preppy kids. Real preps have designer clothes and are very superficial. Fake preps are also very superficial, but go to places like abercrombie and hollister|`|C0KejMfVaa	well, your friend is wrong. its not a lifestyle its a way of dressing. its sweaters, pencil skirts, polos, pastel colors. no matter what anyone else says its NOT abercrombie and hollister. they are just simply popular brands.<br>  <br>  when you type "preppy clothes" into google images you get this:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=preppy+clothes&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a>|`|SWHFvXI0aa	preppy a life style? anyone who labels and then automatically doesn't like a certain "style" is shallow and you shouldn't hang out with that kid<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Read Darlas comment to your friend.|`|vwsO7Pv8aa	Girly.|`|jTKYXB9Xaa	preppy is smart, posh golf wear|`|L4H6Q8PEaa	a preppy is like a a jock, they think theyre better then everyone, or in other words they're the popular GIRLs. they only get their clothes from certain stores like abercrombie. that is the BIGGEST THING! you have to get ur clothes from abercrombie. its so stupid, especially when theyre usually kind of stupid in a way|`|DmL2WCDdaa	someone who wears fancy clothes, rich, girly pretty much. much respected by other girls and liked by guys. not necessarily mean.
GQh9NyLuaa	Yes, you should moisturize daily, however, it will not have any effect on how well you tan. What kind of moisturizer are you using? Are you using one with holistic lighteners? One with alpha hydroxy acids to exfoliate? Or are you just using a standard moisturizer? AHA based moisturizers will change the texture of your skin due to exfoliation and lightening agents will help to even out skin tone.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Unless you're using one with self tanner built in, then no, your skin color won't change.

The most you will get is maybe 6 hours. The manufacturers say to use their products for 4 or 6 weeks for results, but I have found that as soon as you stop, your face returns to its previous state within a week. However, Olay  and L'Oreal are quite good. If your skin is very dry go with L'Oreal Wrinkle De-Crease Collagen Filler and Collagen Filler Eye Illuminator.  Follow up with one of their moisturizers.<br>  <br>  I am using the entire Olay regenerating scheme, been at it for about 4 weeks, and see no difference except my face seems dryer.  The L'Oreal routine I mentioned above worked better.<br>  <br>  The only proven product by prescription is Renova cream. You will need to see a dermatologist for the prescription.|`|GQh9NyLuaa	Yes, where are your wrinkles? Do you sit out in the sun a lot? Are you a sensitive skin type? Do you wear sunscreen everyday?<br>  <br>  These are all important things to know if you need a recommendation. There are several sites out there that offer online consultations for free. Either post back answering those questions or SkinStore.com has free online chat with their Estheticians.|`|7OjiB7vWaa	well if your talking about wrinkles near your eyes then use eye cream every night.|`|AA11881071	my mothers swears by it
ZY2GT7edaa	girl, it's $7000--u can by pretty much anything ur little heart desires...GO FOR IT!|`|QfYGhtVwaa	I reckon you could get a pair of shoes that look the same for much, much, less really. But, if you want to splurge and show off and say that they are 'designer', then waste $700 on them. Your money, your choice. <br>  <br>  I would put most of it away for future in a high interest account myself and buy a few treats for myself and my family. I once won ï¿¡10.000 on a scratchcard. One thing my family would accept was a day in a health club. Most went on bills and of course, I halved it with my boyfriend (now husband). <br>  <br>  Have fun with it!|`|oYF3nIbsaa	Wow nice job! Lucky you!! How did you win?? If they are going to be "out" of style in like a year i wouldnt bother buying them unless you are going to really wear them a lot.

Good luck!|`|9eQD1Yk9aa	I don't think they are worth it,<br>  you can buy shoes that look the exact same at like Macy's or somewhere.|`|NGYoZs1Kaa	You spelled Luis Vuiton wrong(:|`|mwcaGj06aa	no i'm sorry i don't like them and depends your feet can grow|`|0e9563d0f8550dfcc52aed5a7fa95f5aaa	awesome lucky you. If you really like them and you are going to wear them when you go out a lot of the time then they are worth it if not then you should really think about buying them or not. Then again it's your decision maybe buy a pair similar to the heels and cheaper and spend your money buying something else or save it so when something new comes out and spend it then :D|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Are you going to wear it? Will it be appreciate by you and people? Idk, it's you choice but personally $700 is a lot...|`|QRbHPy3Oaa	Go for it!

5Sp6h5Qzaa	My hair is about their length & I use hot curling rollers! You can vary the size and shape of the curls by the length of time you keep them in (3-5 minutes for loose,wavy curls and 10-15 minutes for bouncy,big curls) <br>  Another option is a spiral curling iron... <a href="http://www.cjshoppingmall.com/images/cd55wbc_curler.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cjshoppingmall.com/images/cd5...</a><br>  Finish off the curls with a spritz of hairspray or curling product.<br>  :]|`|KWSzx2ZLaa	get a curling iron (a GOOD one!!)!<br>  <br>  hope it helps!!|`|SWvdcaPraa	Use a big curling iron.

But no.<br>  <br>  For the most part dial soap is very drying. When you dry out the skin it tries to "fix" it self and over produces oil. Usually causing more breakouts.

ddXQeEvNaa	Getting your hair thinned is really damaging, they either cut your ends with a razor (which gives you a ton of split ends and frizzier hair than you started out with) or they just cut chunks of your hair out, which is terrifying.

Go to a hair place ask them to thin it, and what it is. Is they use scissors with wierd serrated things on it that only cut small amounts of hair or something. So instaed of cutting your hair it only cuts some of it so it looks fine, and thinner. Dont to it to often though.|`|SgtvDDcjaa	You can have a hairdresser cut layers into it to thin it - make sure they have handled your type of hair before though. The way to cut layers into fine hair is very different than thick and frizzy hair!|`|zO0CFFvCaa	If I were you, I would keep your hair. Most people LOVE thick hair.

It also depends on your financial status. If you can afford expensive stuff (ex. me), then shop at Chanel, Versace, Burberry, Barney's, etc. But, if you can't, that first of all, sucks, but if you can't, shop at places like Express, N.Y.C, Icing, Nordstrom, Apple Bottom, etc. :)|`|L4H6Q8PEaa	some big places are hollister, AE, and abercrombie, anything their will give you a ticket to style|`|vM4mR94waa	yes it is true skinny jeans are in and vans shoes go to these stores like papaya,,, holister,,, areopastle,,,,,, american egale ,,,,,|`|VLNwmoeQaa	ummm...sorry past that...well id love a guy whering pumas not skinny jeans!|`|qcpVR7vGaa	yeah skinny jeans 4 guys and girls, girls- plaid, tunics, tight shirts<br>  <br>  guys- idk<br>  <br>  idk|`|chuNwSTtaa	american eagle and hollister falls into the sixth grade style category as well|`|geTW8buCaa	Skinny jeans are cute with flats, uggs converse or vans :)? I think pink, yellow & green skinny jeans are adorable!  Are you spring shopping? Try  pinks, yellows, spring colours :] quarter length sleeves, maybe some cut tanks. Gladiator sandals are also in, :] urban outfitters had tons of cute ones! Check  out delias, urban outfitters, abercrombie. Nordstroms department store has cute stuff. If you're into more preppy stuff, try lacoste, j.crew, ralph lauren they have really cute classic polos, sweaters, & shoes:]<br>  good luck... Shopping Is so funn! :]|`|ESfmC9xOaa	well, im in sixth grade and skinny jeans are definitely in! also shop at stores like hollister and abercrombie, i luv those stores! scarves are really cute too,also accessorize! <br>  hoped i helped|`|SWHFvXI0aa	SKinny jeans are cool if you skate/bike/rollerblade... if you don't then don't wear them.<br>  <br>  Shop at Pacsun/AE/Hollister<br>  <br>  Or danscomp.com or albes.com (pick albes :))|`|9bZbyhmjaa	Hollister
PKRZtwyHaa	dont get a tattoo|`|oAkGBiobaa	try a bunch of different sites. google should do it.|`|icEMyJBoaa	Yes, you are right.<br>  <br>  nil means nothing<br>  grave means heavy<br>  alis means winged ones<br>  <br>  If you want to know the grammar....<br>  <br>  Nil acts as the subject, meaning "Nothing," and it's described by grave, meaning "heavy." Alis is in the dative plural, meaning "to (the) winged ones." So, literally, it means, "Nothing heavy to the winged ones."<br>  <br>  So, more eloquently, "Nothing heavy to those who are winged," or "Nothing is heavy to those who are winged."
MDpydGPeaa	No it doesn't have to be tight, but it shouldn't be loose either.<br>  <br>  What you may not be aware of is that a corset needs to be worn in. To do this, follow the following procedure.<br>  <br>  Once you have bought the corset you need to wear it in. To do this, initially tighten the corset so that it is firm not tight. Wear for a couple of hours and then tighten a little more. Keep repeating this process over 2 or three days until the desired snugness is achieved. This allows the stitching in the corset to take the pressure evenly, protecting your purchase, and also allowing the corset and boning to mould to your body giving a great overall comfortable snug fit. Remember that the corset needs to be pleasurably snug with the pressure evenly taken over the body. It should feel like a tight embrace or firm hug, there should be no tight spots. If there is a tight spot then the corset is too tight or the wrong style and you need to loosen the laces. Ideally you should not wear a corset worn in by someone else and you should never let someone else wear your corset (The corset has adjusted to your shape someone else trying it on may alter the shape).<br>  <br>  With regard to how tight to lace the corset, that is up to you. You must have a reason why you are going to wear a corset; ie a shape and firmness that you want to achieve. Do the above procedure until the required tightness is achieved. Remember that if it feels uncomfortable or there are any tight spots you need to back off the laces a bit; a restrictive feeling is normal.<br>  <br>  Regarding the lacing advice given above, this is wrong. Most corsets use one lace to tie the corset. Starting at the top this lace is threaded through the corset leaving two loops at the waist tape. The lace is tied together between the bottom two grommets forming a continuous loop. To tighten the laces start at either the top or bottom and pull in the slack working up/down until the slack is taken up in the loops at the waist. Repeat on opposite side of the waist. Keep repeating alternating between the top and bottom until the desired snugness is achieved. Tie laces off in a bow. A link to show you how the laces should be<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.romantasy.com/index.html?BodyURL=ZXQ/cyboutique/corset/how_to_lace.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.romantasy.com/index.html?Body...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck :)|`|AA10060784	No, it doesn't have to be tight the first time. It doesn't have to be tight at all, for that matter, especially if you plan to be moving around a lot, but if you do want to lace it up tighter, here's the rules:<br>  <br>  If it hurts, it's too tight.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you can't get enough air into your lungs, it's too tight.<br>  <br>  If the edges are digging into your skin, it's too tight.<br>  <br>  Use two separate laces for it. The first one should come up from the center of your back and the ends should tie at the top, the second should start just below the first and go down to the bottom of the corset, and tie at the bottom. That way you can cinch your waist in without squashing your ribcage. <br>  <br>  If it's not a corset that's been custom made for your body, you won't be able to lace as tightly as you would a custom-made corset. <br>  <br>  And yes, I know men can wear corsets, but I'm not sure why, because the point of a corset is to give the look of an hourglass figure- something that's considered desirable in women, not so much in men.|`|50eec528d28a6c9e6975ac8b0d604143aa	Well I knew men could wear corsets, but I don't think it would be too comfortable since the boning in corsets are designed for a woman's body. <br>  Ya learn something new everyday.<br>  :D<br>  <br>  Anyways, I would start wearing it tight enough where it's snug, like a tight T-shirt.<br>  Later after getting comfortable moving and breathing in one make it gradually tighter and tighter until you're happy with how it looks.|`|9RC3ZTATaa	A corset should be comfortable when worn and not over tightened.  And yes, men can wear them as well as women.|`|wZlqxCTNaa	I know nothing about corsets, but I think the point is that they're supposed to be tight.
p2YkMMSvaa	ok, I am/have been going through the same thing right now. All I can tell you is to shower or bath twice a day, (apply secret,dove,or degree clinical strength), carry deodorant/antiperspirant with you in your purse or locker or whatever. Apply it all throughout the day every time you feel wet. relax too because stress can cause you to sweat more. I use a regular deodorant and it works pretty well for me, I just have to apply it maybe three times during the breaks i have at school. so Good Luck :]|`|7pLdMDeaaa	i have the same problem.<br>  i use the clinical one. that you put on at night<br>  there are also some that you get over the counter and they work really good, but sting a little. my advise is just keep trying different ones cuz were all differnt|`|tGf48z8Maa	rexona girl is really good.<br>  make sure you dont use stuff like 'impulse' which is just a smell-good thing not an anti-perspirant make sure whatever you use is an anti-persperant it will fight off the sweat|`|SIE3HuHRaa	I use the cucumber scented one from Dove and that one is fab! :)

It worked for me when I was growing my bangs out.  You can also pull your hair back.|`|ZaTLsifIaa	You could try using bobby pins on both sides of your hair, but don't pin up the bangs.|`|XHZ5JwmCaa	hair cutt|`|AA11165924	I don't think you really made your question clear. You want your bangs to show more than they already do? If that's what you're asking, go to your hair stylist and tell him/her this. They will be able to help you. <br>  Or try pinning back your hair with clips, a headband, bobby pins, etc.|`|hnPMIJDLaa	use bobby pins to keep your hair parted for a while, and soon your hair will shape with it. Do it especially when you come out of the shower.|`|9qMCCQI4aa	pull the rest of your hair in a pony tail for a few days and brush your bangs forward. it will train your hair to start growing like this again.
eYiYCnb5aa	yes, it happens to me too.<br>  Its because your jeans stretch out a little bit, with all your moving, walking, sitting and standing.|`|lIumT7lmaa	ya, it happens to me every time you get jeans wet, they skhrink a little, and then during the day you just strech them out again...<br>  just was your jeans more often if you want them tight fitting|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Thats why i get jeans a size smaller|`|WFItVntAaa	barbie perfection is kinda stupid to buy jeans a size smaller either way itll shrink later on in years!|`|A0iwdDNlaa	becuase jeans strech over time and you just gotta wash them to shrink them back up again
