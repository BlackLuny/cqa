20070602185540AAif9Yi	Computers & Internet;Security	Question about Trojans/viruses.?	Somehow my husband accidentally got a virus on our computer, this Trojan that hides itself in the form of a virus protection program, called Spylock. It was on there from last night until I woke up this morning.      I got up, found out what it was, and immediately did a system restore to 5 am yesterday morning -- well before it was downloaded. Do any of you know enough about computers to know if that would have removed it completely? I have AVG version 7.5 as an antivirus, and I scanned it this morning and it didn't find anything, but I'd like to make sure. Thanks!

20070726191952AAMoCev	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is my laptop screen fixable? And if so, how much would it cost?	Okay, here's the thing.      This is a fairly new laptop, I think my parents bought it like two years ago, or last year. Not too sure.   Anyways, Today I set it kind of under my bed.   Moreover, the keyboard was under the bed and the screen was facing the bed. I had to go get my nephew food and I was doing something so I didn't want to close it.      Anyways, when I got back to it, the complete right side was messed up and there were small little lines running through the top..      The top right part is like really messed up though..I can't post a pic of it right now tho cause my camera's battery is charging and for some reason my laptop doesn't like SD cards      Anyways, it is quite messed up, and I'm sure I would have to go somewhere like Best Buy and have it fixed..but how much do you think it'd cost?      Specs:   Type: Gateway   OS: Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition - Service Pack 2   CPU: Intel(R) Celeron(R) M processor 1.50GHz    Intel Corporation Intel(R) 915GM/GMS,910GML Express Chipset 64MB   (tbc)
20070801122528AAOr2IN	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop Broken?	Ok so it isn't really broken, just f***ed up every now and then. My issue is that my family has cable and therefore my whole house is a WIFI hotspot. Meaning i should get internet everywhere in it and for the most part i do. The problem is that sometimes (randomly) my laptop will not connect to the web via the router. Yes i have the little switch flipped so it can recieve the signal, yes the router is turned on and no i'm not an excess of 60ft away from the router. Just every now and then, usually after 7pm it stops connecting. It then works again arounf 1am and like 11am. Doea anyone have any idea what's wrong or how to fix it?

20081029220808AAKZBvb	Computers & Internet;Security	What just happened on my Mozilla surfing?	I was surfing like usual, but then the settings just changed.   Instead of the mouse wheel (I don't know what it's called--the dial that sits between the right & left buttons) moving the web page up and down, it instead started changing the size of the font on the page.      If I clicked on some text it would make a rectangle around that text Sometimes I clicked on a link & it would make a rectangle.   Sometimes I would click on a link & it would open up a new tab *instead* of following the link in that same window.        I have my settings so that no tabs are opened (I HATE TABS) so it always opens in a new window.  This time I couldn't make *anything* open in a new window.   I couldn't make the damn screen stop changing font size instead of scrolling.   I tried going to the Tools/Options to see if any settings had changed.  They hadn't so there is no reason why everything was opening in new tabs instead of the same window.   Also, I don't even know why when I clicked on text that was not a link, a rectangle would form around that text.      I finally just logged off the computer and restarted it and the problem went away.  But I want to know WTF triggered this so I won't accidentally do it again.      I didn't do anything out of the usual and this has never happened to me before.  so.....what triggered this?

20080929111244AASA3WS	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	How do I set up a wireless network without a modem?  It's in a dorm room, so the ethernet plugs into the wall.?	The directions (It's a Netgear WGR614 v7) tell me to turn off the modem and router and then turn everything on in a particular order.  I continue to get error messages during setup that the internet isn't connected (although the lights on the router show that it is).        Is there some magic secret that I'm missing?        The router seems to be connected to the internet, because when I connect the ethernet to the router, and then the router to my laptop, it automatically overrides my homepage to the Netgear setup page.      I guess what I need is "Setting up a wireless network in your dorm room for Dummies".       Help, please?

20081025185439AAIlSeK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Help! Major tech whiz needed?	So, long story: I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop running XP. About a month ago, it started having this problem when I attempt to connect to my home wireless network. It says "Acquiring Network Address" for about five minutes, and then just gives up, not connecting.   I figured the problem might possibly have something to do with my external hard drive, which broke down around that time. However, today, I got the hard drive back from Geek Squad, plugged it in, and still no success!   Oh, and by the way, I went to my aunt's house last weekend, it connected to her network fine, and my mother's and sister's computers are also connecting to our home network perfectly. So it's just me at my house.   Please help!

20090128211500AAfsMjk	Computers & Internet;Software	Graphic files  vectorized version of the other ?	2. If you have two graphics files , one being the vectorized version of the other - the original raster graphics file, which of the two files is easier to use when introducing localized transparency of 50%? Select the most appropriate statement by eliminating unsuitable statements.       A) In raster version of the image, pixels in the specified area can be erased , thus, making localized areas of raster image transparent. The file has to be saved as PNG , which supports transparency .   B) Vector version of the image is more suitable for introduction of local transparencies since local selection is easy by definition.         C)    Transparency has to be introduced in vector graphics file, where it is easier to select local areas, but the final result has to be saved in PNG (raster format), since it is more efficient to save transparent areas as arrays of pixels . Defining transparency for vector shapes is not possible .
20090128212751AAnxeLy	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Test(If any of you are good at web design, help me out please.?	1.) We practiced with raster quality in class. The last stage of raster transformation is saving it in a given graphics format . Now, is it possible for a PNG file to be smaller than the JPEG of the same graphics contents?    A) Yes , but only in case of 256 colors or less.    B) Yes , PNG is normally smaller than JPEG set at the highest quality .    C) No , PNG is lossless, while JPEG always inflicts quality loss, and, subsequently, is always smaller than PNG .       2.) Pick the correct statement about rendering (of a web page in a browser).    A) Creation of a sequence of HTML elements in browser window based on their order in HTML markup . Position of HTML element in the sequence defines its position on the window. CSS properties are used to define colors , margins , etc.    B) Defining position and dimensions of an element is based on its HTML tag attributes and associated CSS properties .   C) Rendering is the process of creating document flow based on HTML markup. The document flow will be displayed in the browser window by the browser based on HTML tag attributes and CSS properties .       3.) You created a monochrome chart in PPT(Power Point Presenatton). Now you have to convert your PPT presentation into a webpage to be viewed in the browser. You were also told to use a graphics format which would not cause quality loss and occupy less memory . Which graphics format would you use?    A) PNG    B)JPG   c)GIF

This prevents the driver from configuring itself properly.I am using Mcafee and do i have to uninstall it,install the graphics drive and reinstall Mcafee or is there another way of doing it without uninstalling Mcafee.   The Nvidia website also says Before installing new drivers make sure you uninstall all NVIDIA display drivers from the Windows Control Panel. Browse to the Start Menu > Windows Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs and search for "NVIDIA Windows Display Drivers" or "NVIDIA Display Drivers" and select remove.   I have checked Add/Remove and can only find,    Nvidia Drivers,to remove,I am guessing the Nvidia websiite meant this but as I said guessing and would like to know for sure.   Thanks alot ........

20090225155009AA1R7sX	Computers & Internet;Security	Did you ever get this virus pop up screen?	UGH, I accidentally went to a site that I didn't think was bad. I opened a new tab, and it went crazy. First, "My Computer", with the folders, local disk, and such popped up, but it didn't pop up in a new window. It just took over the page of the tab and it told me I had 70 viruses in my documents, and 300 in some other folder. Then this pop up said "you have to get rid of it blah blah DOWNLOAD THIS THING." So I canceled, but it wouldn't let me leave the page because "I NEED to download this due to the viruses." I used task manager and got out fine... Nothing else popped up, no real warnings, and I think the warnings I got were fake. It all happened in a tab, so I felt like it was fake, and it was like the computer had an opinion: "This is sooo bad, it's taking your credit cards."      Did this ever happen to anyone? Is it fake?

So I have had this computer for a few years now and ever since I remember it has been slow. So we took it in to a computer specialist and he wiped our hard drive.

We have also gotten Charter High Speed internet. Both computers use all the same maintenance software such as Norton 360, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. And they both use the same browser, Firefox. The Dell runs fast and works just fine, but the other computer (HP) is running extremely slow. PLEASE HELP!
