VB76LCmSaa	are you saying your trying to get into boxing?  don't worry about your weight untill your in the pro's.  right now, when your in the best shape whatever your weight is then, is what weight devision you should be in.  for instance, when i was in the top of my game i weighed 180 so i was in the welter weight devision.  your main goals in boxing is to be quick and powerfull, float like a butterfly sting like a bee!  so don't worry about loosing weight, that will come with all of your exercising and healthy eating.
aGgZVDrlaa	El Autoestima es quererse a uno mismo y querer a los demás. Significa saber que eres valioso (a), digno (a), que vales la pena y que eres capaz, y afirmarlo. Implica respetarte a ti mismo y ense?ar a los demás a hacerlo.<br>  <br>   Conceptos<br>  La autoestima comprende dos elementos psíquicos:<br>  1. La consciencia que cada uno tenemos acerca de nosotros<br>  mismos, de cuales son los rasgos de nuestra identidad,<br>  cualidades y características más significativas de<br>  nuestra manera de ser. Este grado de consciencia lo llamaremos<br>  autoconcepto.<br>  2. El segundo componente es un sentimiento: El aprecio y<br>  amor que experimentamos hacia nuestra propia persona,<br>  la consideración que mantenemos hacia nuestros intereses,<br>  creencias, valores y modos de pensar.<br>  La autoestima es una necesidad psicológica básica que<br>  hemos de cubrir para alcanzar un desarrollo armónico con<br>  nuestra personalidad.<br>  a) Necesidad psicológica:<br>  La autoestima nos ayuda a seguir adelante con nuestros<br>  planes y proyectos:<br>  ? Porque hace crecer nuestra imagen interna.<br>  ? Nos da fuerza, mantiene la motivación ante fracasos<br>  y fallos.<br>  ? Nos ayuda a fijar metas y aspiraciones posteriores.<br>  4 Autoestima<br>  Francisco Massó<br>  48<br>  La salud psíquica depende en gran medida de la autoestima<br>  o regulador interno, que mantiene el tono de<br>  la conducta ante la incertidumbre de los retos nuevos,<br>  el riesgo del desánimo y los desgarros que hemos<br>  de afrontar en nuestra convivencia.<br>  b) Deber personal:<br>  La autoestima es una obligación radical, básica, igual que<br>  respirar, alimentarnos bien y dormir suficiente. Es el deber<br>  que tenemos de conocernos, aceptarnos y querernos tal<br>  cual somos.<br>  El ser humano es el único animal con consciencia de sí:<br>  ? Conoce aspectos de sí mismo: aptitudes, cualidades,<br>  intereses...<br>  ? Valora positiva o negativamente tales rasgos.<br>  ? Reconoce su competencia para resolver problemas.<br>  ? Asume la responsabilidad de su propio desarrollo personal.<br>  ? Se acepta, respeta y se quiere.<br>  ? Reconoce su condición social y el valor de la convivencia.<br>  La adquisición de la consciencia de sí es una actividad<br>  agradable que ata?e a elementos corporales, psicológicos<br>  y sociales.<br>  Esta consciencia es orientativa. Nos hace estar disconformes<br>  con ciertos rasgos, carencias y limitaciones; esto<br>  alienta nuestro desarrollo posterior, para superar tales<br>  características. Además, nos indica en qué circunstancias<br>  y áreas podemos ser útiles a las demás personas.<br>  La autoestima, proceso psíquico híbrido de pensar y sentir,<br>  repercute en satisfacer correctamente las necesidades<br>  y funciones corporales y psicológicas así como los compromisos<br>  de nuestra proyección social.<br>  <br>  Espero te halla servido!<br>  Si como a mi, estas palabras te gustaron, puedes buscar matarial sobre Manuel Francisco Massó, es Licenciado en Psicología por la Universidad Complutense, diplomado por la Escuela de Organización Industrial y Analista Transaccional certificado por la Asociación Latinoamericana.<br>  <br>  Ha sido Miembro Fundador y Presidente de la Asociación Espa?ola de Análisis Transaccional.

Es un constructo que trasciende la idea básica de autovaloración, y aunque la incluye, va más allá e incorpora aspectos biopsicosociales, pues las debilidades de autoestima afectan la salud, las relaciones y la productividad, mientras que su robustecimiento potencia en la persona global, es decir, su salud, su adaptabilidad social y sus capacidades productivas.La definición correcta del término autoestima es materia de debate en las diferentes escuelas psicológicas y psiquiátricas, así como en áreas fuera del enfoque científico para el bienestar mental humano. Particularmente en el New Age, las definiciones suelen ir en el sentido de halagar al creyente. Otros psicólogos de la autoestima, como Nathaniel Branden, insisten en la necesidad de reformar las convicciones filosóficas da?inas programadas en el paciente para así poder lograr la curación.|`|RhndtLRIaa	es el amor propio , el hecho de querernos y aceptarnos tal cual somos|`|cHldpZVYaa	es el poder que tiene una persona para quererse a si misma..|`|nyyJ0yNyaa	Es el primer paso , para llevar una vida plena,|`|rgkQpzwBaa	amarse a si misma , no sentirse menos que nadie y tampoco mejor que nadie, simplemente sentirse feliz tal  como eres,segura de si misma.<br>  es el amor propio asía uno mismo eso es muy importante para la felicidad de una persona.|`|Vtl9ilj8aa	Hola Marysol !!!<br>  <br>  Es el aceite que nos hace grandes que alimenta nuestro amor por nosotros mismos y nos hace valorarnos en su justa medida.<br>  Una estrella.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|RpmShwQyaa	Valorarse uno mismo..|`|NKtCFZU6aa	Es amarse y aceptarse uno tal cual es.<br>  La autoestima es una poderosa fuerza dentro de cada uno de nosotros, comprende mucho más que ese sentido innato de autovalía, o sea , el derecho a nace el hombre quien intenta avivar.<br>  el autoestima es el resultado de dos hechos básicos, el primero es la supervivencia y nuestro dominio del medio ambiente y el segundo es el uso correcto de nuestra conciencia.<br>  una peque?a definición formal en la cual dice:<br>   "es la experiencia de ser pato para la vida y para las necesidades de la vida, consiste en: <br>  1) confianza en nuestra capacidad de pensar y de afrontar los desafíos básicos de la vida. <br>  2)Confianza en nuestro derecho de ser felices, el sentimiento de ser dignos, de merecer, de tener derecho a afirmar necesidades y a gozar de los frutos de nuestros esfuerzos.<br>  <br>  (ˉ`v′ˉ)<br>  `?.?.?′<br>  ?*?′?.?′¨)*¨)☆<br>  (?.*′ (?.*′ (?☆<br>  MYSTIC_D_PUMS??′ˉ`☆-|`|NYgtue94aa	Lo que creemos de nosotros mismo|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Es el autovalor que se otorga una persona, la cual le permite alcanzar el equilibrio emocional.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|aHAN2lnLaa	Hola<br>  <br>  La auto estima es la forma en que nos valoramos nosotros mismos.

xWbc8RpSaa	Im on that too =). Well as of nearly 4 weeks ago and as of yet no period! Starting to bug me! Though the instructions and my dr said that you may just have eratic periods like if normal because the pill does not manufacture your periods in the same way a mini-pill does (one you take 3 weeks then break).  If you are worried see the dr =).  Hope I helped xx|`|HXxkTltQaa	Hi there  i am on the same pill as you, that is not normal amount of period, it usually stops the period.  i was put onto it to stop my period pain,  please go and see your gp about the lenth of time you are on a period as that is not normal|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	You don't say exactly how long you have been taking Cerazette for, but It's quite common to experience irregular bleeding when taking the Mini pill- after the first year 70% of women find that they no longer have periods. Progesterone hormones can also induce bleeding, which can become erratic- if this fails to settle down, see your GP.

Tests these days take into account whether the urine is fresh or not. So if she's using a sample someone else gave her or she bought on the Internet, most likely they'll detect that.

eqC5EBkJaa	Yes, you can (lose the lbs and get more fit)...although, I don't understand how you play both center and guard :-). Keep in mind to focus more on body fat% than pure weight loss. You could lose 10 lbs and if you're tone and fit, have a very nice and fit body, or lose 20 and not look so good.. Get your body fat % checked (doctor or any good gym) and set a goal of how much fat to lose in ~6 weeks.    Get rid of the soda...gum should be ok.  Eat more lean protein (including meat).     More specifics below if you need them:  Different people hold fat in different places and that last little bit of fat is usually the hardest to lose. Here are some things I have found useful   - Do sprint repeats. It may not be warm enough to do outside (so bundle up or find an indoor track). Jog to warm up (~1/2 mile). Then do 8 sets of repeat sprints (start with ~100m and gradually move up to ~200m as you get in better shape). Basically you sprint all out, then slow jog (really slow) back. Repeat 8 times. The first one you want to go only ~3/4 speed since your body will still be warming up. Make sure you stretch afterwards as your hamstrings will be sore the next day (especially after the first time).  You can also do suicides, or lines, or whatever you do for b-ball.  - Resistance training: go for more reps (less weight), try drop sets, try circuit training. All of these are useful for getting more lean and tone(and as a result will burn fat off your abs). Remember the more muscle you build, the more fat you'll burn (muscle burns fat).  - Ab ball: do a lot of exercises using one of those ab balls...they work your core in every exercise. You can also do actual ab target exercises (twists, crunches, etc.). Get a trainer at a gym to show you some (usually you can get one complimentary session). Or you can get the CoreSecrets (ball/video) for ~$10-$20 online (just google it)  - Oblique exercises (twisting). Do a lot of these using the ab ball: sit on the ball hold a 10 lb weight and walk your feet forward. 'Lay down' and with the weigh above you twist to one side-up-pause-twist to the other side. Ensure you're using your obliques to do the work.  - Lower abs. Do leg lifts (hold weights in your feet, or lay on ball and do them). Leg raises (where you hang in the air and rotate your knees to your chest). Get with a trainer at a gym to show you some new funky ab exercises  - Improve your nutrition to mostly eat low fat protein (chicken, fish, lean turkey, etc.) and veggies (i.e. broccoli) or find some you can stand). Mix a little fruit in there for some sweetness. You can also buy whey protein and make whey protein smoothies (2 scoops protein, ice, skim milk - blend - little peanut butter, ripe banana, more ice - blend again: tastes great). Cut out any junk food (especially soda, anything loaded with high fructose corn syrup, all sweets, etc.). You wanna eat 5-6 small 'meals' per day as this will keep you from being hungry all the time and 'pigging' out and will keep your metabolism up.   - Start taking some active energy multivitamins. Also (if you're 17+) you can try a thermogenic fat burner such as Ripped Fuel (provides extra energy and helps burn fat) or Hydroxycut Hardcore...but follow the instructions (take before you workout and don't exceed the daily allowance).    Work hard, have fun...you should start seeing increased levels of fitness and energy in a month or so. I've been doing something similar to lean out for every summer for the past few years and it works.
bfRcVXL1aa	Rest it. Then gentle exercise. Then rest it again. It will go after a few weeks. You have pulled a ligament. Very common complaint.
vdIXzX4naa	Awww...but the worst is almost over :).    Don't worry about your hairy leg. At one of the orthopedic practices where I had my casts changed they even shaved my leg for me both before changing and after I got my last cast off (and the one after that when I abused my stiff leg and tore a ligament).    Unfortunately, you won't be back in the gym next week - you will be doing physical therapy because your leg has been immobile for six weeks and is not ready to support weight. You will still need crutches for a few weeks while you get back to normal.    But you'll be back to normal before you know it and your cast and crutches will just be a memory :).    Love, Kari|`|bm1rsts7aa	Lol they see stuff like that all the time. Pretty much every woman who has a cast on their leg has that happen.    It's normal for it to still be hurting. As far as the gym goes, ask the doctor and see what feels okay. If it hurts, stop.|`|AA10333093	Cheer up Jessica,    I'm sure that the doctor and/or nurse who remove your cast will have seen a leg with hair from time to time.    I'm most parts of the world, women never shave their legs.    Bring a pair of jeans to the doctor's office and wear 'em home, if it bothers you.    And yes, sometimes a broken bone will hurt for a couple of months.|`|XwPyne6Raa	I think  the doctors are use to seeing hairy legs.  I am sure they don't even think about it.  They are more worried about how your leg healed.  When I broke my leg I had pain for a whole year.  It all depends on how bad you broke it.  Not sure you will be in the gym next week to workout, but maybe for a little physical therapy.

Long-term complications of HCV infection include liver cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer.

The most common early symptoms are mild fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Later symptoms may include dark coffee-colored rather than dark yellow urine, clay-colored stools, abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes (jaundice).
ouzrDPaSaa	People get sectioned if there is a serious and immediate risk of them hurting themself, or someone else if they are not admitted into hospital.    Self-harm in itself isnt enough to get sectioned.  Many people self harm and it is known to the professionals involved in their care. Self harm is normally a coping mechanism, to distract a person from the emotional pain they are feeling.  Self harm is different from a person being suicidal and professionals can (hopefully!) tell the difference between the two. So the potential risk has to be severe or possibly life threatening, like if a person is stating their intention to kill themself.      If people are likely to become violent towards someone else they will be sectioned.  An example is a person who is delusional and thinks their neighbour is plotting to hurt them, so they want to "get in there first" and injure them.    These days as there are less mental health hospital beds steps are taken to keep a person safe at home if possible.  This is sometimes done through a crisis home treatment team, who will visit the person intensely at home and work with them.    If possible the person is admitted of their own free will.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	the mental health act is designed to protect people with mental health problems, it does not allow people to be sectioned for minor reasons, you have got to have a serious mental illness problem at that time, for example you might be clinically depressed in need of treatment but are refusing it, you might have a psychotic illness whereby you believe that people are talking about you or that the tv is broadcasting messages to you or that you have superhuman powers, there are mental health commissioners who monitor every single patient that is on a section.  patients on a section once improved are allowed out of hospital on leave once an assessment has taken place and that person has shown improvement. the police also have the power to section members of the public under section132 of the mha this means that they can section the person if they believe them to be acting strangely in a public place, it is the police duty to take them to a place of safety, usually the local psyche hospital|`|5c47af8bffbd3c35498c08737caa396faa	When a person is at risk of harm to self or another person.... they might have strong thoughts / delusions which cause day to day living to be a problem (believe food is poisoned, think the terrorists are after them) or not be able to concentrate causing health and safety risks e.g. fire risk in the kitchen.  People don't really get sectioned for 'mild' self harm.... more attempting suicide or active suicidal plans.    In terms of anorexia, that only happens at the point when they are likely to die - down to 4 stone etc and need medical intervention.  Before that, the professionals will try to support the person in their own environment with counselling, outpatients etc.|`|AA11864715	I was going to answer this, but now all I can say is read Frozen Rose's answer, that sums it up perfectly.  By the way those sectioned due to anorexia will have fallen to  a specific BMI, you don't normally get detained under the Mental health Act for anorexia unless your height/weight ratio is life-threatening.|`|p96PiyiIaa	It depends where you are to be honest. The Mental Health Act  is the same almost everywhere, but here in the UK it takes a lot to get sectioned unless it is a private hospital. I think it is easier to get sectioned in the USA, but don't take my word for it.     Generally, a patient can only be sectioned if two doctors and a social worker or a close relative of the patient believe it is necessary. One of these doctors is usually a psychiatrist. The other is often a GP. However, in an emergency one doctor's recommendation may be sufficient.     A person can only get sectioned if there is evidence that that person is going to cause harm to him or herself or someone else. There is no real definition on "harm" though; if a person cuts then they don't like measure how deep the gash is or count how many scars. But there does need to be some evidence, not necessarily physical. A confession is the best evidence though.     A person can be sectioned for us to 28 days if necessary. However, most people go into hospital voluntarily so that they can stay longer in required. A patient can be discharged from hospital at any time if doctors believe they are no longer a threat to themselves or anyone else. But the "nearest relative" also has a right to "order the discharge" of a patient if they want. doctors can block this by producing evidence that the patient still represents a risk to the public or him or herself, and if that happens, the relative cannot try again for another six months.       People can get sectioned for practically anything, from a personality disorder to an eating disorder to an anxiety disorder etc. I was sectioned for self harm and depression, and a friend of mine was sectioned for drug abuse. Well... to be fair, I went in voluntarily into a private juvenile psychiatric ward, but I didn't realize how long my stay was going to be.     My advice is if you are or know someone that might be sectioned then:  * Research the hospital your going to to find out what your privileges are  * Be prepared for a lot of "group therapy"  * Bring a pack or cards, because that's pretty much all you'll have to do.    take care xx
QykYW3R7aa	Seroquel is a VERY sedating medication.  It's an antipsychotic which are usually used in psychiatric patients with schizophrenia, but because of its sedating properties, it is commonly used to treat insomnia.  It's mechanics are a bit strange though.  Dosages range from 25mg as a sleep aid to 800mg to control episodes associated with schizophrenia.  The lower dosages are commonly more sedating than higher.  I'm not sure about the pharmacokinetics, but the sedation actually decreases the higher you go, and once you reach a certain point, it begins to have opposite effects rather than amplified effects.  My psychiatrist told me this.  So it is quite possible that 100mg would make you more sleepy/groggy than the 200mg.|`|1oBilGHuaa	Maybe you don't need such a high dose.  Tell your doctor about what happened.  Seroquel also comes in a small 25mg pill. I hope you and your doctor will figure out what dose works best for you.  Good Luck.
TV4I1aALaa	Its really simple.  It may seem hard at first but its really not.  If you wanna do these things on ground   its probably best to start on a trampoline.  You should probably start by lifting some weights with your arms.  Not big ones just probably some 2 or 3 lbs.  Its best to get your strength up.  Your arms are used more then anything.  Then plant your feet as best as you can.  Keep your back firm.    Hope i helped!
VB76LCmSaa	3 actually isn't bad, i'd say its average for a high schooler and above average for a grown man just off the top of my head.  loosing weight might help you do one more but you'll see no significant change.  are you doing sets?  try doing 3 sets of 1 or 2.  then when you can, move up a rep.|`|eqC5EBkJaa	the answer is it depends...it depends on what weight you lost.  Typically people lose strength when they lose weight.  If you are able to keep all your strength (or the vast majority of it) then you will be able to do more when losing a significant amount of weight.  If you lose strength proportional to weight loss, then you will likely not be able to do anymore.      Hope that made sense...|`|aY40cuPZaa	it's the same with my wife.  she takes med's that help her out.  she's over weight.  she needs the pills to help her.  i help her out with her feeling.|`|AA11546221	Back in the mid-90s, I had a former overweight roommate in San Francisco. The way her thought-process worked, she believed her fat was nothing but muscle...seriously! So everyday when she got home from work, she would always eat at least a half a bag of chips then tell me, as I am sitting next to her, to feel her arm or leg & say that it's all muscle. But of course, I would tell her that it's not. Anyways, you just reminded me of my experience with my ex-roommate. Thank god I don't live with her anymore because she also had lower back problems where one of the disks of her spine was touching a nerve cuz of her fat. But anyways, I know for sure that lots of protein increases strength. My ex-boyfriend, would workout everyday but he would eat nothing but healthy food. When we used to go grocery shopping, he always read the label plus eat tons of fruits (or fresh fruit juice extracted from a juice extractor), veggies, seafood (salmon), some steak (but steak can be costly). If you haven't done so, you should do a search on Google to know what nutritional vitamins from foods the body needs & just stick with it. I hate prescription medication with a passion because there's always a side-effect. From my previous experience, if the doctor doesn't tell you the side-effect, you discover it later after you've taken it.

The maximum you will be charged is 10 (which the fee that can be levied for a Subject Access Request - the official name of your request).    You need to bear in mind though that the doctor is entitled to withhold some or all of the information if he reasonably believes that the information contained within the records may cause you harm or distress or cause you to harm other people. This is mainly invoked around mental health records.    If you do not know where your records are, they can be traced easily enough by the NHS but it will take more time.    Generally requests for medical records are free. Also note that if your medical file is very thick, then they can offer to let you see the record at their premises and copy what you need rather than copy an entire medical records which could be expensive.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Why not?

eqC5EBkJaa	3.  To burn the fat the fastest on treadmill, do Interval training (look up HIIT) on google.  Basically sprint at the highest setting as long as you can (maybe 30-60s) then slow jog for 60-90s.  Repeat this 8-12 times.  Make sure to warm up first and stretch afterwards.

Mental and physical changes alter your body slightly. That's why sometimes if your stressed your period will come later|`|s5sPny97aa	it's because meat is fattening, and so when you eat a lot of meat your weight increases, making you start earlier.    also, there are lots of hormones and chemicals in meat, because the animals are given them so that they grow faster and fatter so there's more meat to eat.,    hope that's helped.

It is available by prescription only.    Eat foods high in vitamins A, E and C (see Related eHows), or take supplements in addition to your diet. However, pregnant women should avoid taking more than 25,000 IU of vitamin A.    Add foods or supplements to your diet that are high in zinc (see Related eHow), which is good for the skin, and silica (beets, brown rice, bell peppers, soybeans, leafy green vegetables and whole grains), which helps form collagen, the supporting fibers in the skin.

RvPuRmqAaa	Funny, someone else asked this same question earlier today. Here's what I told her:    A close friend of mine tried it - and no, I'm not secretly talking about myself :)    To put it mildly without being offensive she had to excuse herself while out on a date about 10 times as the grease from the foods she ate choose that time to be affected by Alli.    From what she told me the pills prevents the grease in food from being absorbed by the body, so it has to come out some way!    She was very embarrassed. That is her story but I don't know if this has been a problem for everyone on this pill.    Straight from the Alli site here http://www.allipills.com/weight-loss-pil... it says that side effects are oily stools, flatulence and vitamin deficiency.    Healthy eating and exercise is the best way to go. That's what I recommend. Best of luck to you!|`|PDUmHzjxaa	The thing about Alli is that it only prevents your body from absorbing at most one quarter of the fat you take in. And fat is usually not the biggest source of calories.    If you eat high fat foods the fats make up about one third of the calories. So Alli will at best prevent you from absorbing one twelfth of the calories in a meal. And that's if you're eating high fat foods.
MHW8j3rqaa	Go for a walk every night after dinner for an hour instead of sitting in front of the computer or TV.

But if your really concered about it then eat healthier and stay away from the junk food.|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|IIjixM4Raa	ok im 13 and i wanted to lose a bit of weight and all i did was eat healthily and exercise like dog walks and exercise dvds !! i lost about 4 pounds and i cut out crisps and chocolate.|`|AA11388636	I'd say eat 4 small meals a day and run almost everyday.

B9ZbNGSTaa	Well, I can relate to the problem.  Unfortunately, it's common to have a lot of urinary urgency during pregnancy, even without a prior diagnosis of OAB/urge incontinence.  Stress incontinence tends to get worse as well, (oh, the joy).  However, you really will need to talk to your doctor about it.  His/her advice will probably be to stop taking the Detrol if you're trying to get pregnant.  They haven't done human studies to evaluate this, but some animal studies have shown that Detrol can be harmful to the fetus, and this has caused most OBs to recommend that you not take it during pregnancy.  It's also possibly unsafe to take while you're breastfeeding.
K0c6yq3caa	First of all, you seem petite for your height anyway so that would be harder to lose weight. I doubt you could lose anything over 1 pound even in the first week. Like i said, it will be harder for you to lose so making your waiste smaller will be to however, if you do stretches from side to side and find exercises for your waist.  You want to make your calves and thighs smaller? Well exercise every other day untill you sweat. Do arobics or dance, that really helps. Walk or run.  Tips for a good diet, Drink plenty of fluids and eat all the variety of foods within poportion. Keep the diet by writing in a diary everyday of what you eat then you can see where you may go wrong or could change or imrpove you feeling good about yourself.   Hope that helps x|`|2q1XI0j9aa	1: diet and exercise  2: 2  3: diet and exercise  4:  To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|1YcKHGLqaa	This isn't what you want to hear, I guess, but you shouldn't be losing weight. at 111 your BMI is already in the underweight category, and losing another 6lbs could start to cause serious health issues.|`|0zxiLWdcaa	Walk everywhere you can, at least an hour a day, I swear it helps. And eat a lot of small healthy meals. Like cream of wheat with fresh berries for breakfast, apple a couple of hours later, salad for lunch, another small piece of fruit, fish for dinner, and then another small snack a few hours after. It speeds up your metabolism if you eat more during the day. If you want to lose weight in your thighs/calves, do cardio, like running, and crunches and side crunches for your waist.

gSo4dR7oaa	Yes.  More than 98% of people who have HIV test positive within 3 months. In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.  It would not take longer than 6 months, so you are fine.    To Katherine:  Most people who have HIV have no symptoms for SEVERAL years after getting infected.  Some people do get flu symptoms within a few months, but it is impossible to distinguish between flu symptoms caused by HIV infectioon and flu symptoms caused by actual flu. That is why the only way to find out if you have HIV is to get tested.|`|tmIFbL8aaa	uhh if your gettin tested that much i would assume not|`|omqdtfUPaa	It's probably fine. Usually if you were to actually get HIV, you'd see symptoms way before the year mark. You're perfectly healthy ;D|`|r28rZWqLaa	You are probably ok.  Tests most often pick it up within three months, but definitely by six months.  If you are still concerned, get another test in 3 months.  If you are sexually active with random people, then getting tested every three months is a good practice anyway.|`|oAnt1DsMaa	If you were exposed then you should continue gettin tested every 6 months for another year.

I83sYbARaa	The medications, drinking, and possible hormone problems/imbalances could definitely contribute to headaches....  Even tho you are 17, you might try to convince your doctor to take you off the medications, and try some natural ways of healing...  Dont drink, or smoke.... they really badly effect your health, and could be the sole cause of your headaches...  Medications can cause a lot of problems....  The food you eat, you may have allergies to some of them, and a regular doctor wont test for them... you will have to see a naturopathic doctor or someone trained in testing food allergies...  for that....  Start eating healthy foods as much as possible, load up on veggies, and fruit, and drink 1/2 your body weight in water everyday.....  Also, at least 30 minutes of exercise, even just walking, every day....  And seek the opinion of doctors with other perspectives on healing, like traditional chinese medicine, naturopaths, herbalists (licensed), etc.....  Headaches that dont go away can be the sign of more serious conditions, so you HAVE to stay in touch with your regular doctor... just be aware, and ask about the side effects of the medications, and if and what the harmful effects of taking them are......   then decide if you want to take them, or try something else less harmful.  Your health is ultimately up to you....   doctors wont heal you.... only you will....  Why are you drinking so Much?    Just something you could ask yourself.....IF you feel you need to talk to someone , I hope you have older adults you feel safe with....  and if you want a really cool easy to learn technique that might help with your emotions/health/ or anything else go to www.emofree.com  and download the free technique there , learn it, apply it to yourself, and it will be something you have then to help yourself for the rest of your life, no matter what.

As long as you continue to take the pills you shouldnt have a period until you finish the second pack of pills.

wHn2VITgaa	You can check these home remedies. I'm sure that one of them should be useful for you. Good luck!!!    When the skin lubricated, become clogged or are not regenerated in sufficient quantity to handle the load this may result in whiteheads or blackheads being formed. Pimples are then formed when the bacteria is released from these clogged pores.    For serious blemishes, try washing with Fels-Naptha soap, strong stuff for oily skin. However, if your skin is normal or dry, youll need something gentler for your face.    Clearing Up The Outside From The Inside Grandma, like mothers everywhere, swears that all the high-fat food we love so much does a number on our complexions. Scientists may not be quite as convinced, but to be on the safe side, avoid chocolate, chips and fried foods.      Eating more brown rice is good advice for improving overall health. It is also good for your complexin. To ward off pimples and other facial blemishes, make brown rice a regular part of your diet.    Keeping the skin and body hydrated by drinking at least eight glasses of water daily is an effective method of keeping the skin clear and assisting it in clearing wastes.    Studies show that zinc deficiency may contribute to acne. Be sure to check with your doctor before taking a supplement, since too much zinc may have harmful side-effects.    Spread It On Thick To help fight pimples, use a paste of onion and honey. Cook one sliced onion in a half cup honey until it is tender. Mash with a fork to form into a paste and allow the mixture to cool. Apply to the problem rea, leaving it on for an hour before rinsing away with warm water. Use this treatment every night before going to bed until your complexion is clear and sparkling. An application of egg whites helps distribute the skins natural oils more evenly, eliminating both dry and oily patches.    Swab the egg white on your face with a cotton ball, allow to stand for five minutes and remove. Studies have shown that certain amino acids in the egg whites protein may have some anti-inflammatory properties. In most cases, small blemishes and pimples can be eliminated or reduced in size in a matter of days.    Oatmeal has long been used to control the spread of acn, as well as to speed up the healing process. Prepare the oatmeal as directed (without the milk, brown sugar, and raisins, of course!) and apply to the face. Let it stand for ten to fifteen minutes before washing off. The abrasive action of the oats cleanses deeply and increases the peripheral circulation in the affected rea, which speeds up healing.    Acne and eczema as well as psoriasis have responded well to a paste made from the grain amaranth and placed on the affected area. Internally, it is taken as a tea. Take two teaspoons of the fresh seeds and cover them with boiling water, simmer on low heat for five to six minutes, remove from the heat and add two to three amaranth leaves and allow to steep for thirty to forty minutes. Two cups per day should provide relief from a number of skin problems.    Super Strawberry Facial If you have a chronic problem skin, try Grandmas Super Strawberry Facial. It takes a little while to prepare, so you have to plan ahead. About four hours before youll want to go to bed, combine a cup of mashed strawberries in two cups of white eider vinegar. By the time youre ready to go to bed, it should be ready. Make sure you strain out all the solids and keep the liquid. Apply liberally to your face. Dont worry, it dries quickly.

JIJ3aFVgaa	According to my research, some laser pointers are safe--up to a point. Reassuring, isn't it?     The majority of the laser pointers used in the U.S. are Class 3a diode lasers in the 630-680nm wavelength (translation: your garden-variety red laser), with a maximum output of between 1 and 5 milliwatts.     Here's where it gets a little tricky. The FDA has determined that Class 3a lasers could cause injury to the eye if viewed directly for approximately 0.25 seconds. You'd think this would be enough to ban them, but the FDA cited evidence that exposure to visible lasers is "usually" limited by the blink reflex of the eye, which they have timed at just under 0.25 seconds. Quite a coincidence, I'd say. Be that as it may, the FDA has issued a warning that the pointers aren't toys, shouldn't be used by children except under adult supervision, etc.     Others have taken firmer action. The U.K. has banned the sale and use of all but low-powered laser pointers, and many school districts in the U.S. have banned them as well--here's a news account of a kid who used one to hurt a teacher.     Damage can include, but is not limited to, flash blindness that can last for minutes, partial vision loss that can last for months, permanent damage to the retina, and loss of life if the police officer who you are pointing the laser at thinks that she/he is being targeted and decides to shoot you in self-defense. (I exaggerate only slightly--there have been reports of officers who drew their weapons after mistaking the laser light for a gun sight.)     Now, to add to this, I've got some good news and some bad news. First the good news: Most lasers manufactured before 1993 were Class 2 lasers with a power output of less than 1 milliwatt, which would make them somewhat safer than the ones put out today.     The bad news? More powerful laser pointers have recently been imported from Russia and China. These lasers emit a green beam, and have emissions significantly exceeding the maximum permissible exposure. One of these lasers was found to have a removable filter. When removed, this laser pointer had an output in excess of 15 milliwatts, which would make it a Class 3b laser.|`|jt4PVBKkaa	if you think that you don't wanna screw up your eyes just don't mess with the laser pointer lol seriously its not that hard (no offense.)
grm23kvjaa	Go to a gynacologist and talk wth them.. it sounds like it would be a good idea to go on the pill to help with the irregular periods and control the cramping. make an appt to see the gyno as soon as you can just to make sure something is not wrong.|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	a week to 10 days is a rather drastic change after 3 years of steady periods.

You really don't use pectoral muscles unless you lift weights, You could put heat on it for an hour on, an hour off, continue the rest, and take pain medication. If you pulled a ligament or tore something, it takes 4-6 weeks for it to fully heal. Don't try to resume bench presses too early like in 3 weeks, it is likely that you will re injure it. It may be frustrating, but your going to have to wait the full time in order for it to completely heal.

XhIYAH6Laa	Personally, I have only been diagnosed for a little over a year, however I have already had 4 separate MRIs. You obviously don't have them done frequently if you were diagnosed 10 years ago and have only had two done since. I don't see why they wouldn't do both spine and brain this time around. Although, only one of mine has combined both, which was during my diagnoses. From what I understand my symptoms are more brain lesion related, so maybe that's why they are more concerned on just getting the brain image. Could it be this way for you? Good Luck with everything!|`|mTSYemNgaa	Don't let a doctor dictate what you should do. I had to argue with my doctor to get an x-ray on my back. He said  I didn't need one, but insisted.

DG2fefYnaa	Since I don't know what your current diet and exercise plan are, it's hard to answer, but, if you drink regular sodas, cutting them out would save you LOTS of calories.  If you drink coffee, try cutting out or reducing the cream.  More fruits and veggies, less sugar and simple carbs (whole grains are great).  Baking, broiling, boiling, poaching, but no frying.  Walk around the block a couple of times a day, or ride a bike.  Do some sit-ups.|`|JoIyi9gsaa	Well, quick  and effective changes would be like cutting right back on wheat and sugar, or even cutting them out completly for a couple of weeks. I lost 7 pounds doing this. No alcohol is another and eating much more raw salad veg and cutting back on general carbs, like rice and cereal is also a very good trick for the body.    Also have sugar free sodas instead and half fat milk. Little changes like this make a big difference over time and that's with even no exercise.    hope that helps    oh and drink plenty water whenever you can.|`|fYed2Crjaa	Ya obviously eat healthy. I try to eat a fruit such as an orange before lunch to fill up a little before i eat a large lunch. The same applies for dinner. A lot of cardio exercises. They burn a lot of calories and are very slimming. For me personally, swimming keeps me in the best shape, but i know swimming isn't for everyone. Try joining the gym and attending some different classes and find one that works for you. Pilates is becoming really popular with celebs because it is really slimming. I've tried a few classes myself and they are really fun and not too strenuous.  Good Luck|`|d42f7a395262237c37e027833fde0bb5aa	I have lost about 40lbs in five months trying weightwatchers, but recording everything you eat may not appeal to you.    Basically I eat a really low fat diet, and very few foods containing sugar, so check out the saturated fat content of you food, and go for the lower fat brands. And I always ensure I have my 5+ fruit and veg.|`|KppM3VzAaa	Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.     hope that helps|`|2q1XI0j9aa	To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!
UBJkmXVhaa	Yes, you can ask your gynecologist to write you a prescription (any doctor or nurse practitioner can, and your gynecologist is a doctor).     There will be time during your appointment to talk to him/her.  Simply say that you want to start taking birth control.  Be prepared with the date of the start of your last period.      There are several options for birth control, so it may help to research beforehand (NuvaRing and Mirena are some alternatives).     Good luck!|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Yes that is who you ask.|`|yuh7OsHDaa	nopeee dont ask them  ask your doctor  or go into a walk in clinic,  they gave me the first two packs for free to try it out  im on tri cyclen low and its very good  i recommend it ,   then once ur on it and take it everyday around the same time and up for new packs  go get ur prescription and go to the pharmacy by the walk in clinic  and if u have a coverage plan  thats good

SDHvDNGJaa	Son las hormonas sexuales femeninas, las producen los ovarios. Y los precursores de estas hormonas los produce una glándula que se encuentra en la mitad de nuestro cerebro que se llama la hipófisis o la pituitaria. Controlan nuestro ciclo sexual, la elsticidad de la piel, y otras funciones. Son de naturaleza lipídica, es decir, son grasas y para poder producirlas necesitamos consumir alimentos que contengan grasas...

AA10003191	It all depends on the doctor who told you that.    He needs to see a vascular specialist. Honestly, MRA gives poor quality images compared to CT Angio.

The vertebrobasilar arteries are at the base of the skull, and if stenosis is identified, a further test called cerebral arteriography may be done.     The narrowing of an opening or passage-way in the body, is called strenosis  And to be quite honest there is not much can be done for the patient, unless aspirin to thin his blood.    They don't do any repairs, unless it is to the heart  as some people get mitral strenosis of the heart, and have to get the paton ductus repair, like my sister did.

Precum is pre-ejaculatory semen. It is the fluid that ejaculates from a man before the "Big Bang" Although it is a small amount, you should always use protection because you can still get pregnant and contract STD's from it.     BE CAREFUL LADIES! Pre-*** may contain sperm from a previous ejaculation, so there is a chance of GETTING PREGNANT! Men don't always know it's going to happen, as they don't always feel it.     Pre-ejaculate does not usually contain sperm unless there has been an ejaculation, even a day-old ejaculation. Urinating removes some of the sperm but not all. Part of the job of pre-ejaculate is to "wash" out the penis to ensure a safe journey for the sperm when it DOES come. Pre-ejaculate has no sperm in it itself, only sperm that has been washed away on its way out.     I hope this helps. MC
IVyJSfusaa	You don't get fat by eating when you have anorexia, it's a long process to gain weight. If you've eaten very little, your metabolism will be slowed down, in order to make sure the most vital processes in your body gets enough energy. This means you will need a little less food to keep your weight. It is also a part of the reaction that your body will store more fat (not from everything) than it did before. As you start to eat, your metabolism will be increased and you will need more food to maintain your weight/gain weight. It is very individual when your metabolism goes back to normal, it takes longer time the longer you've been sick. A very few of those who suffers from anorexia nervosa actually lose hair, you usually has to be very undernutrited over a long period of time before that signs will show.
t9IrZHqJaa	I'm guessing if your doctor switched you to a generic PPI (proton pump inhibitor) it's probably Omeprazole (Prilosec).     40mg is a big dose, but it shouldn't hurt you. It might cause some minor digestive problems, but I'd try to keep it to whatever your doctor prescribed (probably 20mg?).    Good Luck, I hope this helped!|`|JwzX38R5aa	You should never change your dosage without your doctor's advice.|`|GeA6BCuFaa	yes|`|zNMXmpz9aa	40mg a day is a typical maximum dose, but in some cases you can take more, but that may not be the wisest thing to do.  If the generic is not working look into seeing if there maybe some other treatment that will work, or if maybe having your Dr write "Brand Medically Necessary" on the Rx will fix your co-pay, or whatever is driving you to get the generic.  In most cases, you have the right to request brand name, it just effects your co-pay.  Whatever you do, do not augment how you're taking a prescription medication without contacting your Doctor first.

Para obtener sus beneficios al consumirlas unas pocas nueces son suficientes debido a que contienen muchas calorías.<br>  <br>  Beneficios del aceite de almendras<br>  <br>  1- Se usa para suavizar todo tipo de piel incluyendo pieles secas y escamosas. Es emoliente suavizante e hidratante y ayuda a desinflamar. Debido a su composición es muy usado en la industria cosmética. <br>  <br>  2- Es muy usado en los spas para dar masajes porque es ligero y su nivel de viscosidad no causa problemas pero ayuda a que las manos deslicen y ofrece beneficios para la piel.<br>  <br>  3- Se usa en aromaterapia como aceite portador o sea para diluir aceites esenciales. <br>  <br>  4- Se usa en el tratamiento de cabellos maltratados ya que les proporciona brillo y suavidad.<br>  <br>  5- Debido a sus propiedades anti-inflamatorias se le usa en problemas respiratorios tomando una cucharadita mezclado con otros aceites vegetales. Este aceite ayuda a despejar la mucosidad de los tejidos. <br>  <br>  6- Se usa para dolencias del sistema digestivo pues tiene un efecto laxante.<br>  <br>  El aceite de almendras lo venden en tiendas de alimentos naturales y en algunas farmacias normales. <br>  <br>  Presentaciones y precio<br>  Relativamente es un aceite caro pero comparado a los cosméticos que lo contienen es muy barato. <br>  <br>  Este aceite se obtiene por prensado al frió y por extracción y refinamiento. Idealmente se debe de usar prensado al frió ya que el refinado a veces es calentado y pierde algunas de sus propiedades, en otras ocasiones quedan residuos de los productos usados para extraerlo. Pero el aceite refinado no tiene olor lo cual es mejor para las aplicaciones en cosméticos.<br>  <br>  Usos del aceite de almendras <br>  1- Como aceite portador en aromaterapia se usa:<br>  Para masajes 4 onzas (118 ml) de aceite de almendras con 50 gotas de aceite esencial <br>  Aceite facial 1 (29.6 ml) onza de aceite de almendras con 10 gotas de aceite esencial<br>  <br>  2- El aceite de almendra se puede usar directamente sobre la piel como aceite de cuerpo o como humectante facial. Se usa en su estado puro o se puede mezclar con otros aceites que requieren diluirse como rosa mosqueta, ricino (para el cuerpo), germen de trigo, borraja etc. Se puede también usar puro con unas gotas de vitamina E. <br>  <br>  Se puede aplicar de igual forma sobre estrías o lugares problemáticos.<br>  <br>  3- En el pelo se puede aplicar puro o con otros aceites o aceites esenciales. Aplicar dos cucharadas y cubrir con un gorro plástico, dejar por 15 minutos o más y luego lavar del pelo como de costumbre. <br>  <br>  espero que te sirva|`|mOHZchkAaa	no lo se  pero  si `puedo decirte que el aloe vera es excelente

KLkjAcPPaa	En caso de que los síntomas no sean demasiado acusados, las hemorroides realmente no requieren de un tratamiento específico. Es más, no todas las hemorroides llegan presentar síntomas, ni tan siquiera hacerse visibles.<br>  <br>  A pesar de todo, no está de más adquirir algunos hábitos que nos pueden ayudar a prevenir la formación de hemorroides, o a paliar sus síntomas una vez ya han hecho su aparición. Dietas ricas en fibra, que favorecen el tránsito intestinal y ablandan las heces, resultan de lo más conveniente. El papel higiénico conviene que sea suave, y tanto en casos de estre?imiento, como diarrea, debería tratarse el problema lo antes posible.<br>  <br>  En caso de un ataque de dolor agudo, generalmente causado por la presencia de trombos en la hemorroide, es posible conseguir un cierto alivio aplicando compresas frías, con hielo, en la zona. Tomar algún analgésico, como por ejemplo paracetamol, por ejemplo en su conocida marca comercial Gelocatil, también es una ayuda. Si el dolor no remite en cuestión de horas conviene visitar al médico que probablemente nos recete algún tipo de pomada calmante, al estilo de la pomada Hemoal o del gel Hemoclin, que nos aliviarán los síntomas. En general este tipo de productos buscan el alivio sintomático puntual; hacer desaparecer rápidamente el dolor, la irritación, el picor, la quemazón, la inflamación, etc., ayudando a la cicatrización de posibles fisuras anales. <br>  <br>  Si aun así el problema persiste posiblemente se deberá recurrir a la hospitalización y alguna de las diversas técnicas quirúrgicas.|`|HezBS4Xmaa	mm lo mejor que TEE PUEDES HACER como dices. es ir al medico. ya que no es buano que te automediques. ademas que no sabes ni que es lo que tienes. no tines nada qe preguntar aqui. ya que no somos especialistas. y si ahi uno aqui. pues tiene que checarte fisicamente. asi que enserio ve al doc. si es muy preocupante lo que pasa|`|affd7f14d305a6b3433ceb308534826eaa	La causa puede ser hereditaria, estre?imiento continuo, mala circulacion sanguínea, estres.<br>  No hay que automedicarse, debes consultar al medico, pudiera ser se?alar de un cáncer del recto.<br>  Consume suficientes fibras para que el excremento sea blando y toma bastante agua.

pcGgavNtaa	For one thing you do not need to do cardio every day. You should alternate it in 3 times a week. Definitely do not do cardio just before doing legs.  One important thing to remember is to mix up your cardio routine. Swim some, treadmill, bike, walk, etc.  <br>  Sauna would be good. I prefer the steam room. It really opens the pores of the skin and I felt like it was getting the junk out of the body. |`|CzS1EiV9aa	I use the sauna after the workout everyday, just to help me relax before the shower.  Try it and see if it works for you.|`|AA10530949	I've never heard of sauna's offering a "health benefit" other than perhaps being relaxing, which is especially good for your muscles after a tough work-out.  You have to be sure that you're drinking water, though, because saunas will make you dehydrate through sweat.  Also, it's probably a good idea not to over-heat yourself... maybe keep it to a max of thirty minutes.  And again, make it a goal to drink an entire bottle of water while you're in there.  Other than that... relax!
p0Wcw9rVaa	That would do more harm than good because your muscles need to rest after a workout. Destroying them once, then doing it again in the same day will decrease gains and will overwork your muscles. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest going once for lifting, and again for cardio/abs if you really want to go twice daily.|`|6449b6c500236878e6f99de28ef2909caa	No No No No.<br>  <br>  The reason yourmuscles become sore after working out is because you tore the fibers. These fibers need a full day to repair themselves - which then builds the muscle during the repair. <br>  <br>  If you keep tearing the same  already-torn fibers, you're just going to end up getting an injury. <br>  <br>  Work muscles out every other day. Focus on your chest and back every other day, and focus on your stomach the other days. Let muscles rest so they can heal and build!|`|pcGgavNtaa	Your muscles do not grow because you lifted weights twice.  Your muscles grow because you did the proper exercises with the proper weights, got the correct nutrition and the necessary rest. Your muscles actually grow when they are resting not when you are working out. You can over work them and hurt yourself. <br>  Do the proper workout and you will not need to go twice.<br>  I do the P90X workout at home and I am seeing some great results. If my eating habits were better I would see even better results. 1 hour and I am spent. Nothing left to go back to the gym for.  Unless you are going to lift and do cardio on the same day. That is fine except the days in which you do legs. No cardio those days. |`|ad1HXt45aa	Don't work the same muscle twice a day. Your morning workout will tear your muscle and your body will begin the rebuilding process. Working the same muscle out again will just hinder the rebuilding process. 
Pys8PVySaa	You need to first eat healthy and lay off any snacks that have food coloring, and maybe 2 or 3 times out of the week, don't have any starch like bread, pasta, chips, potatoes, etc. lots of starch in a diet can make a belly pooch. Start walking! Walking is one of the best exercises anyone can do. As you walk, tighten your abdominal muscles, but don't suck your stomach in, that's not good for you. Just eating right, drinking plenty of water, and walking and maybe some cardio, you will really start seeing results. Never use any diet pills or stop eating altogether. You can really damage your body doing either one.  Best of luck!|`|oR31Kyp5aa	The best way to lose belly fat is to adopt a full body training routine that cuts away fat from your entire body. You want to include multi-joint exercises such as lunges, squats, deadlifts, step ups, swings and snatches.<br>  <br>  Equally important is your diet. It is critical to eat 5-6 healthy meals a day. In other words, plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, low-fat dairy, etc. Cut back on deep fried foods, sodas and sweets.<br>  |`|pcGgavNtaa	Change eating habits. Eat 4-5 smaller meals during the day. Cut out the carbs and sugary drinks. <br>  Exercise. Walking is great. 30 minutes a day. Ab exercises are good. you do not have to do them till you get a 6 pack. Do enough to firm up the muscles in your stomach. <br>  |`|3ULL37Koaa	eat less, find something to do not in front of the TV or computer such as drawing, tidying up your room, or re-arranging your clothes.|`|AA10530949	You need to loose belly-fat without over-doing muscle-building exercises that will tone your ab muscles.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but sit-ups and crunches are NOT the answer.  Aerobic exercise, like running, swimming (anything that gets your heart pumping), is the type of exercise that burns fat, which is what you're looking for.  It may be helpful to do some sit-ups or crunches but you certainly need to emphasize aerobic activity if you really want to lose the gut.
EyprudN8aa	Daltonismo<br>  .El daltonismo -denominado así por el físico británico John Dalton, quien lo padecía- es un defecto genético que consiste en la imposibilidad de distinguir los colores (discromatopsia). Aunque ningún daltónico confunde los mismos colores que otros, incluso pertenecientes a la misma familia, es muy frecuente que confundan el verde y el rojo; sin embargo, pueden ver más matices del violeta que las personas de visión normal y son capaces de distinguir objetos camuflados. También hay casos en los que la incidencia de la luz puede hacer que varíe el color que ve el daltónico.<br>  <br>  El defecto genético es hereditario y está ligado al sexo, debido a que se transmite por un alelo recesivo ligado al cromosoma X, lo que produce un notable predominio en el varón entre la población afectada. La mujer puede portar la enfermedad en casos no tan comunes como en los varones , y la transmite a sus hijos varones. Probablemente, la mitad de sus hijos serán portadores. La transmisión genética es igual que en la hemofilia.<br>  <br>   ?Cómo percibimos los colores?  Cuando miramos un objeto con color, el color que percibimos en ese momento puede variar dependiendo de cuando se vuelva a mirar. Por ejemplo, al anochecer los colores parecen diferentes de cuando los vemos con la luz del sol y diferente también de cuando lo vemos con luz natural o con luz artificial. Por ello cuando elegimos colores para decorar el interior, el tipo de luz o la fuente de luz que hay en la habitación se deberá tener en cuenta: si la luz es natural o artificial, si hay mucha o poca luz, si la luz es directa o indirecta, etc.<br>  <br>  ?Por qué vemos los objetos de determinados colores?<br>  <br>  Los objetos absorben y reflejan la luz de forma distinta dependiendo de sus características físicas, como su forma o composición…etc. El color que percibimos de un objeto es el rayo de luz que rechaza. Nosotros captamos esos “rebotes” con diferentes longitudes de onda, por medio de los ojos gracias a su estructura. Si los rayos de luz atraviesan al objeto, este es invisible.<br>  <br>  Las células sensoriales(fotoreceptores) de la retina que reaccionan de forma distinta a la luz y los colores se les llama bastones y conos respectivamente.<br>  <br>  Los bastones se activan en la oscuridad, y sólo permiten distinguir el negro, el blanco y los distintos grises. Nos permite percibir el contraste.<br>  <br>  Los conos, en cambio funcionan de día y en ambientes iluminados, y hacen posible la visión en los colores. En realidad hay tres tipos de conos; uno especialmente sensible a la luz roja, otro a la luz verde y un tercero, a la luz azul. Cada Cono (célula) está conectado individualmente con el centro visual del cerebro por medio del nervio óptico. La combinación de estos tres colores: rojo, amarillo y azul es suficiente como para ver unos 20 millones de colores distintos. Así por ejemplo el naranja es rojo con un poco de amarillo y el violeta azul con un poco de rojo. Es en el cerebro donde se lleva a cabo esta interpretación, pues en el ojo solo se capta la luz.<br>  <br>  Los daltónicos no distinguen bien los colores por fallo de los genes encargados de producir los pigmentos de los conos. Así, dependiendo del pigmento defectuoso, la persona confundirá unos colores u otros. Por ejemplo si el pigmento defectuoso es el del rojo, el individuo no distinguirá el rojo ni sus combinaciones. También puede darse el daltonismo por falta de un tipo de cono, teniendo así solo dos. De esto hablaremos a continuación en los tipos de daltonismo.<br>  <br>  <br>   Tipos de daltonismo  <br>  <br>  Existen varios tipos:<br>  <br>  Monocromáticos<br>  <br>  Como su nombre lo indica, éstos individuos sólo poseen un tipo de cono y sólo pueden ver un tipo de color.<br>  <br>  Dicromáticos<br>  <br>  Estas personas poseen dos tipos de conos. La afección se presenta con variantes, pueden haber individuos ciegos al color rojo, individuos que confunden sombras de rojo, verde y amarillo; o individuos ciegos al azul y que a su vez confunden sombras de verde y azul o naranja y rosa.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tricromáticos anómalos<br>  <br>  Es cuando la persona posee los tres tipos de conos, con defectos funcionales, por lo que confunden un color con otro. Es el grupo más abundante y común de daltónicos, tienen tres tipos de conos, pero perciben los tonos de los colores alterados. Suelen tener defectos similares a los daltónicos dicromáticos, pero menos notables.<br>  <br>  Acromáticos<br>  <br>  Es cuando los conos de las personas no funcionan y sólo tienen visión en blanco y negro. ésta condición es muy rara ya que se ha visto en muy pocos casos.<br>  <br>  <br>   |`|VJTnh495aa	El daltonismo -denominado así por el físico británico John Dalton, quien lo padecía- es un defecto genético que consiste en la imposibilidad de distinguir los colores (discromatopsia).

8yTP3jO8aa	Shakiness could be a sign of low blood sugar, which can happen very easily if you aren't eating frequently enough.  Hunger usually is a sign that you need to eat (duh, I know), but it could also be your body's way of telling you to eat so that you can raise your blood sugar so that your body can function.  Exhaustion could be because your body isn't getting the calories it needs to function properly.<br>  <br>  It might help if you can sneak some of your toddler's snacks to munch on on your way home from work so that you get something between lunch and dinner.  Dried fruit and fruit leather work really well because they give you lots of natural sugars and fiber.  Cheese sticks also work well to give you protein.<br>  <br>  You might also want to look at your normal diet and see if you might not be getting as much iron as you need.  Anemia symptoms aren't quite like the ones you mentioned, but if you're iron levels are a little bit low you can feel out of whack.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to see what changes you can make to your diet to make sure that every bite counts towards keeping your body stabilized and working the best that it can.  Maybe you can add some peanut butter to your waffles in the morning, or making a waffle and scrambled egg sandwich to make sure you get some protein in the mornings.  See where you can add in some fruits during the day (or a banana while you're on your way to work or something), and continue to make sure that your dinner is a balanced meal.  If you can make sure to eat even a bite or two of something healthy every few hours you can help keep your blood sugar and blood pressure stabilized.  Also make sure that you drink plenty of water (or whatever liquid you like).<br>  <br>  Hunger, shakiness, and exhaustion happen a lot in people who have eating disorders too, so know that you aren't alone in how you're feeling.|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	do you exercise? try to eat good things at work. what about your husband or boyfriend. does he cook for you. i can give you some easy to do things while your busy. beautiful baby. hope i can help|`|pcGgavNtaa	The time between your meals is too long. Your blood sugar is dropping down way low and that is what is causing you to be shaky, cranky, ready to pass out and feel like you are starving.

That's the usual lifting plateau.<br>  <br>  At that point, you'll need to change something - set/rep scheme, drop weight & work your way back up (deloading), switch exercises for the same body part (ie, dumbbell chest press instead of flat bench press), or even switch workouts completely.<br>  <br>  But yes, you will eventually hit the limits of your genes.

3cLA6wCWaa	It totally depends on your diet.<br>  <br>  you shouldn't do either if you are on a low carb diet.<br>  <br>  if you aren't on a low carb diet, running will be more strenuous BUT biking would allow you to go further, therefore burning more calories.<br>  <br>  basically, do either for 30 mins 7 days per week. the key to cardio fat loss is PROGRESSION.  because our bodies are highly adaptive.<br>  <br>  so do the above until fat loss stalls. then add 10 mins to each session. do that until fat loss stalls. then add another 10 mins. etc etc<br>  that is cardio progressions.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Br3hJfDCaa	Both are good, so just do whatever  you find more enjoyable, that way you'll make exercise a long-term lifestyle choice.|`|pcGgavNtaa	First thing to look at is your diet.  Cut the starches, potatoes, rice, pasta, breads, etc.  Eat smaller portions in the meals you eat. When you go out to eat cut the meal in half and eat that. Take the rest home. <br>  Now as far as running or biking. Both burn good calories if you are doing them right. For either one try this. Go at a good pace (should be able to talk normally when at this pace) for several minutes then try to go at about 80 -90% of your max for 2-3 minutes. Then go back down to the standard pace for 3-5 minutes.  Then go back to the higher pace for 3+ minutes.  Continue this through the time you are exercising.  This is called interval training.  Your body will continue to burn calories long after you stop exercising. <br>  Which one?  Do both.  Bike one day, jog the next, swim one day if you have access to a pool.  Have several different routes so you do not get bored with the workout.  By doing different exercises you are keeping the muscles confused and getting a better result. |`|NKY9VQeaaa	Running, B/c biking only exercises your legs.<br>  = )|`|THKwNaU9aa	I would say biking because it works your leg muscles.

Lighter weights.  12-15 reps.  <br>  <br>  Abdominal exercises-  sit ups, crunches, twists.  |`|HNo3SczWaa	Cut out dairy and cut out bread, or you won't lose an ounce by then.
fCb3Jhywaa	Cutting off the junkie from your diet is a big step<br>  but to lose what you need you may have to sacrifice a little more ie:. try to get those 1200 calories from healthy foods only, such as fruits and veggies since your goal is 10 pounds in less than a month. Which will be most water waste anyway. Quick diet rule...do not eat after 8PM. <br>  When I need to drop a few pounds on a short period of time like you're trying to do, I only drink fruit juices for a couple days, eat raw food for another couple days and water fast a bit more until I get to my goal. It melts right off really fast.<br>  For beginners it isn't easy. It works very well for me as a quick diet. Of course most of the weight loss is water so it comes back on when I eat regular meals. To really lose weight you got to stick with a diet for life. There's no way around. <br>  Watch what you eat and exercise. Way to go :)|`|IJTcGIG7aa	Yes, so long as you are about average weight right now, and that diet is a cutting out a lot of calories.<br>  <br>  I'd add low sodium intake.   Cut sodium and you can lose a lot of water weight right there.<br>  <br>  Also, taking a multivitamin wouldn't hurt, if you are eating a lot less.<br>  <br>  Also, losing weight isn't something you should look at as short term.   Stick to good eating/exercising habits and you'll never have to worry about this stuff.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Drink water for a week only and you will guaranteed lose 10 pounds in one week.

Doing weight training will put on a little bit of muscle so dont get discouraged if the scale doesnt move even though you are losing fat|`|errJ7VL1aa	You can lose 10 pds. in 3 weeks doing this.  I would add that spreading those 1200 calories out into 5 - 6 small meals a day would work best.  You keep your metabolism up and running at full speed that way.  Also - avoid white bread, white rice, and pasta.  (a low glycemic diet will take the weight off your belly).

En promedio en la primera cita se realiza el acceso, es decir; la apertura de la cámara pulpar y lo que es la pulpectomía (se te extrae el nervio de las raíces), por lo general la segunda cita se realiza la endondocia propiamente dicha, donde sere tiene que "lijar" por decirlo de alguna forma el conducto por donde pasaba el nervio en la raíz y rellenar con un material especial, ya que no puede quedar hueco. En la tercer cita se planea la reconstrucción del diente ya que algunos estan tan da?ados que es necesario colocarles coronas o en su defecto endopostes para fijar mejor la futura obturación.<br>  Asi que estamos hablando de tres citas mas o menos ahora depende de cada cuando te den tu cita y si no existen complicaciones, como dolor post endodoncia o abscesos que no cedan, además si se requiere un endoposte mínimo son dos citas más.<br>  Espero haberte ayudado|`|RpIk28draa	Pues depende de varios factores, por ejemplo si es un diente anterior ó posterior,  ya que los anteriores suelen tener un nervio y los posteriores 2 a más, también influye el grado de infección de la pieza, anatomía de las raíces, habilidad  del dentista, el tipo de instrumental manual ó rotatorio, etc. Algunas piezas pueden ser terminadas en una sóla sesión, y otras dependiendo de los factores que se mencionan tres, cuatro ó más citas.

QsbnsqgBaa	Ahora tengo 45 a?os y a la edad que tu mencionas, tuve mucho acné, mucho, en esa época no era común ir con un dermatólogo, mi mamá se la pasaba obligándome textualmente a que me pusiera mascarillas, por cierto asquerosas de avena con miel, al parecer nada daba resultados.  Yo no me aisle, pero mi carácter era a la defensiva y yo creo que fui medio amargadilla y tenia un complejo de fea que era bastante fuerte.<br>  <br>  Como a los 18 a?os alguien me comentó de la sávila, te lavas muy bien la cara por la noche con jabón de avena o neutro y te pones la baba que tiene esa planta, tiene un olor no muy agradable, pero cuando se seca deja de oler, sientes la cara como estirada pero así te duermes al otro día te vuelves a lavar.  Fue increíble el cambio que tuvo mi piel, en verdad muy bueno, me quitó el acné, los barros y hasta restauró la piel que tenia de cicatrices pues yo me exprimía la cara y esto aumentaba el problema.  Trata de hacer esto, se que te será de ayuda, comprobado 100%.  A un primo que quiero mucho le empecé a hacer lo mismo en su espalda y quedó muy bien.

STEtjMlfaa	my first period wasn't embarassing, but frustrating. i was at sleepaway camp this year for two weeks and in the middle of them i had my first period. it sucked because i didn't bring any pads and the only visible things i saw (my counselor's) were tampons, which i didn't know how to put in. i didn't have that much blood so i decided a few dirty panties were all right. i was fine until the problem began. we had an all-camp swim, and we were required to go in the pool for five minutes. i was so scared that it would bleed through my swimsuit that i didn't even go in and got yelled at for at least 5 minutes straight by my counselor. i couldn't even tell her why, so i just lied and said that the water from the pool already dried. (it was a baking hot day and i would've dried anyway.) at least i wasn't kicked out. =]|`|GCm6wlSZaa	LOL. My story wasn't as bad as yours but it was really embarrassing for me. Well, I was in grade 7 as well and I had tampons in my locker. There was a huge box and I used to put it in a bag in my locker. So, it we had class before lunch and I had a man teacher. There was 20 minutes left before class ended and I realized I had my period. So I was going to my locker to get the box of tampons and the teacher stopped me and was like 'Where are you going?' and I was like 'Bathroom.' and he was like 'But, you didn't ask. What makes you think you can just leave without asking?' and he made me stand there asking me so many questions that I had to tell him about. He was like smiling and like 'Oh, ok. *giggles*' and when I came back, everyone was watching me and my backstabbing locker partner took out the box of tampons because the teacher said that I needed assistance in the bathroom and said I had a "woman accident". He pretty much said in front of the class and I didn't talk to anyone for like 2 weeks! |`|QWOzs1Q5aa	i was in seventh grade and we were in groups and it was me and my two friends that were girls and the other two were boys and everytime i got up the boys would laugh and my friends that were girls were too busy with themselves and didnt pay it any mind, when i got home my pants had a huge stain and it was my first time so i didnt tell my mom but she still found out, but that isnt my only story. One time at the spring fling i was workingone of the concession stand with a bunch of girls and my friend was like screaming," BRITTANY YOU BLED THROUGH" i was like WTF could you say it any louder and i had already been walking around and bending over on tables so a lot of people could have saw by that time, I am glad I had a hoodie to tie around.

On the second day, i put in a tampon knowing i would swim in under an hour.  The flow was heavier that i thought.  I got in the hot tub with friends, and then after like 10 minutes, the water around me started turing redish.  After another few minutes most of the hot tub was like this.  Then a random adult realized and everyone had to evacuate the hot tub.  THen when i got out, my bathing suit bottoms were stained with blood so everyone knew it was me.  Also, i was with a guy i really liked, and because of this, i never got to go out with him.

Water suppresses the appetite naturally and helps the body metabolize stored fat.<br>  <br>  -----Eat breakfast everyday : Do not skip breakfast. Breakfast is break the fast that we have done overnight. Skipping breakfast makes your metabolism slower and makes you hungry which you tend to compensate by eating a lot later.<br>  <br>  -----Eat smaller, more frequent meals (eat 4-6 six small meals) - More frequent meals keep your metabolism charged .<br>  <br>  -----Exerecise to fire up your metabolism and burn more calories - Try 30-60 minutes of physical activity a day. It increases your metabolism .<br>  <br>  -----Take the stairs and park your car further away from the shops - You will end up burning more calories.<br>  <br>  -----Interval training - great way to boost metabolism <br>  <br>  ----Eating foods that speed up metabolism --->(Spices,High protein foods,High fiber foods)<br>  <br>  --------- Spices-Spices boosts metabolism, suppresses appetite, reduce fat absorption and adds taste to your meal. Replace butter or mayonnaise with garlic, chili, mustard, ginger. Saute vegetables and chicken in hot sauce as opposed to oil.<br>  <br>  ---------- High protein foods- Protein increases metabolism. It helps in building muscle tissue. More muscles burn more fat and increases your metabolism. Calories from the protein rich foods are much harder for the body to breakdown and process.Protein is a good appetite suppressant. <br>  <br>  ---------- High fiber foods-Fiber is digested slower, keeps us feeling fuller longer and releases its energy slower which keep our blood sugar levels even and helps us avoid cravings. <br>  <a href="http://weightlossweightloss.blogspot.com/2008/04/increase-metabolism.html" rel="nofollow">http://weightlossweightloss.blogspot.com...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|9tZUir57aa	Starving yourself is NEVER the anwser!!!  Just eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly.  But don't go to extremes.|`|JTrWRUBiaa	Starving oneself usually slows down weight loss. When your body is in starvation mode, your energy output (read: metabolism) plummets, making it harder to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I recommend you read through my sources.<br>  <br>  The second one is a calorie calculator. After reading it, not only will you have a healthy approach to weight loss (instead of starvation, which usually backfires), you'll also be able to get a really good estimate as to how long to lose the weight.|`|pcGgavNtaa	A lot longer than it would if you eat properly and exercise. Eat 4-5 small meals a day. Eliminate junk food, sodas, any drink with sugar, pastas, potatoes, rice etc. <br>  Exercise at least 30 minutes a day by walking, riding bike, swimming, hiking, aerobic exercises,  Something that gets your heart rate up and keeps it up for at least 30 minutes. <br>  You will lose fat and build lean muscle which requires energy to maintain which will burn more fat. You will see dress/pant sizes drop before you will see the large pounds go, but it will happen. As you lose more and feel better you will keep exercising and eating better thereby losing more weight. <br>  Set goals for yourself.  Realistic goals. |`|IRB9OVvuaa	NOT a smart thing to do.. Get some decaf green tea, morning have some egg whites with fat free cheese... Try EZEKIEL bread it's also only 1 gram of fat!!! Lunch have some spinch salad.. dinner have so chicken (not fried) with s little brown rice, also EXCERSISE that the key!|`|rULqETS5aa	if you starve yourself you body will hold on to the stored fat that it has for as long as possible and you will lose weight very slowly.... but if you just start an exercise routine then you will begin to see results, and it doesn't have to be an extreme one either, and when you first start your work out routine you lose a lot of weight at first and then seem to flat line before you reach your goal don't get discouraged you lose water weight first and build muscle so just stick with it |`|zzqgjPu4aa	before you reach that you will be dead. your body loses weight by exersise and diet not not sitting there and not eating.You need to do alot of cardio in your workouts. Strart by running a mile. If you cant do it then dont jog that never gets you heart rate up run as far as you can and where you cant breath slow to a walk and raise you arms. This will alow the blood im your arms to drain to your legs that are doing all the work. When you breath keep a beat. IN your nose:1...2...3...4:hold your breath for 2 of these beats:1...2..3...4...:Then let it out in four beats though your mouth. After 2 weeks try to run without stoping and try to run the mile in under 9 minitues. Every month increase you miles by one. On your fifth month run the five miles. the next month dont increase you miles but increase your speed. Running realises aminoacids in your blood witch loses the fat in your body and starts burning it.OK THATS I5% of losing weightthe other 85% is DIET DIET DIET. eat everything you usally eat in one day and count the calories what ever the number is divide that by four and subtract it from the calories you eat. also start eating more plants. dont take pills I want you to do this right because my mom tryied to take shortcuts in her diet and the pills she took gave her a heart disesae. but if you do all of this the first month you should lose 20lbs of fat alone.<br>  |`|qWMIW0m6aa	if you starve yourself completely you will die before you loose 50lbs<br>  the human body can only go days without water a weeks without food.<br>  Starvation is the easy way out and no one will respect you! your stomach will turn to your body for food and start eating away at muscle and collagen that you can never get back! your body will look 20 and your face will look 40. believe me i have seen it happen it is the lack of collagen in your face that will cause your skin to hang! it is discusting!

Eat four or five small meals a day. Eliminate the junk food, fried foods, starch, pasta, rice, potatoes, etc. <br>  Exercise - Ride a bike, walk (briskly), swim, jog, aerobics, lift weights, treadmill, etc. Mix it up. <br>  For the love handles work on stomach crunches, sit ups, leg raises, rotation exercises etc. Got to build some muscle so they will burn the fat. <br>  Drink plenty of water during the day. |`|aykrvaQpaa	The human head weighs about 15 pounds.

I was a runner and swimmer in highschool and with a lot of dedication you will tone everything!! 
pcGgavNtaa	When you say you watch your diet what does that mean?  You need to eat 5 small meals per day. Cut out white starches (potatoes, rice, pasta, breads etc). <br>  You say you are sprinting 10-15 minutes per day.  That is adding to the muscle mass which is just under the layer of fat you want to get rid of so you are just making your butt bigger. <br>  You need to do more aerobic workouts.  Walking for 30 or more minutes, swimming, treadmill etc.  If you are lifting weights go with lighter weights and more reps.  This is a more lean workout rather than building bigger muscles. <br>  Hope this helps.|`|8dqq0Gwwaa	Start doing leg lifts and squats. It'll take a couple of weeks to see results, but trust me you'll be happy with the results :) Good luck!
pcGgavNtaa	You will need to strenghten your triceps, pecs  (chest) and back muscles.  Do not try to over do it immediately. You will have to experiment with the amount of weight you need to do. <br>  Work on Back and chest one day, shoulders and arms next day and legs and back the next. <br>  <br>  Good workout for chest and back - Do each exercise for one set and then repeat second time. <br>  Regular pushups - Max reps.<br>  Wide grip pull ups - max reps. - Use chair for support if needed- Someone at gym could help.<br>  Military push ups - max reps.<br>  Reverse grip chin ups - max reps.  - palms facing you<br>  Wide fly pushups - max reps - place hands wider than chest.<br>  Closed grip pullups - max reps. - hands no more than 6" apart on bar. <br>  use chair for support if necessary. <br>  bench press - 8-10 reps - Last 2 or 3 should be hard to complete.<br>  Seated rows - 8-10 reps - Last 2 or 3 should be hard to complete<br>  Dumbell bench flys - 8-10 reps - Same as above.<br>  REPEAT ENTIRE ROUTINE. - Do this routine twice a week usually 2 days apart and you will see good gains.<br>  <br>  Shoulders and arms<br>  Alternating shoulder press (military press) with dumbells - 8-10 reps<br>  Bicep curls - 8-10 reps.<br>  Tricep kickbacks - 8-10 reps<br>  Chair dips - max reps. in 1 minute - take mini break in middle if needed.<br>  Upright rows - 8-10 reps - last 2-3 should be hard to complete.<br>  REPEAT<br>  This should be done twice a week with 2 days in between.<br>  <br>  On days you do not lift you should be doing some aerobic workout - treadmill, swimming, aerobics, plyometrics, bike riding, walking, hiking, jogging.  Mix it up.  <br>  <br>  By the time you take your next fitness test you will see amazing results. You will be leaner, stronger, faster, and have more endurance than you did before. <br>  <br>  Chart everything you do - how many reps you were able to do and how much weight. The next time you do the exercise you will know what weight to do and if you need to go up or down.  When doing max reps try to do one or two more than your original goal.  If you can't don't worry.  Keep working on it. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rdKwJVh4aa	Wow - you are joining the Police and don't even know how to get strong?? My advice is give up now! <br>  <br>  Police suck!!|`|TKNPveHDaa	Good for you for joining the law enforcement community.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to talk to trainers about your goals and what you aim at doing.  They can give you suggestions and entire fitness routines.  Stick to that, train hard, stop drinking beer for a while, eat healthy, and you'll be fine.  Three months is a lot of time to improve your body.
QSiMA4y4aa	I usually eat a few times througout the day....I have a morning snack and afternoon snack so I don't get hungry.  Maybe a cereal bar, or veggies/fruit, hummus, popcorn.  If you eat a few small meals a day you won't be as hungry and still should lose weight.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Eat protein along with complex carbs while limiting sugar.  Examples are oatmeal, brown basmati rice, and All Bran cereal.  You need to start it at breakfast and continue into lunch.  Don't worry about lowfat -- that's so 80s.|`|AA11447210	They key is to eat smarter (not saying you are eating dumb!). Experts recommend 4 - 6 small meals a day, versus 3 large ones. If you eat less, more frequently, your body is less likely to become hungry AND it spends more time constantly processing/metabolising the food you have eaten, so your metabolism burns at a higher rate (then at rest) for a longer period of time.<br>  <br>  When you eat just 3 meals a day, with many hours in between, your metabolism goes up (to process that food) then down until you eat again...instead of staying at a more constant higher rate when you eat more frequently.<br>  <br>  Also, eat things high in fiber and water content. The fiber will help keep you feeling "full" and the high water content foods (like fresh fruits and veggies) tend to have less calories.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Try to eat more (yes I said more), but spread that out over 5 meals a day instead of 3.  When you eat less your body goes into survival mode and slows down. You do not lose the fat, but actually lose lean muscle which is not good. You should be eating something every 3 hours or so. Small amount of protein and a veggie.  For a snack eat an apple, nuts, banana, etc.  Stop drinking sodas. No starches (potatoes, pasta, white bread, etc).  <br>  Exercise - Walk at least 30 minutes a day. This is not a stroll. Brisk walk.  Try doing some aerobics at home. Walk on treadmill. Swim. <br>  Careful with the "lowfat" foods because they are full of sugar. That is how they make them taste good without the fat. <br>  Spicy foods will increase your metabolism as well. |`|YbyX6qUEaa	You and try using some mints or something sugar free in between meals. I do that sometimes and it distracts me from being hungry. You can maybe eat a snack like a fat free pudding or yogurt.|`|dvkWQvfDaa	hot herbal tea<br>  <br>  it works. seriously.|`|x1YCrVAxaa	If you are looking to loose weight, eating less won't help. When you are hungry, your body is telling you that you need to eat. Try to balance out what you eat, while also working out. If you starve yourself, than your body goes into "starvation mode", which means, whatever you eat from that point on, a majority of it will be stored as fat, because of the lack of nutrients before. Try eating small meals throughout the day instead, and not just three big meals. (breakfast,lunch,dinner)|`|KMRqbKR0aa	What is recommended is that you eat smaller meals more often.  I would say eating even every 3 hours.  <br>  <br>  Also it is important to eat a big breakfast.  It gives you the fuel to keep you going through the day and wont' make you as hungry later on.<br>  <br>  They say snacking on things like almonds are very good for you and refuel you.  Think of yourself as a car.  You need gas to keep you going!  We obtain our energy through food!  Keep it simple and don't eat twinkies every 3 hours but heatlthy fruits and veggies!  You can even indulge in some sweets every now and then just dont' over indulge!  good luck :)|`|Db8UFIkOaa	instead of just eating 3 meals in one day, why don't you take 6 small meals in one day that's properly spaced out, like every 3 hours, so you don't end up getting hungry.. coz the case is, if you like eat lunch at 11.30 then wait until dinner, you could end up getting very starved, and instead eating a LOT for dinner.. so instead, have several meals spaced out throughout the day.. and taking in lots of fiber also helps because they make you feel more full.. try apples as snacks :))|`|AA11377932	eat little by little on regular intervals, include a balance types in your diets like fruits, salads, grains, juices and drink plenty of water. dont skip morning breakfast, make sure dinner is 2 hours before you go to sleep and drink plenty of water. Salad with yougurt is the best diet food u can have because it has all you need. Hot tomato soup is a good and healthy way to control hunger. Eat brown breads instead of white... <br>  <br>  i ahve done these things myself with positive results.

pcGgavNtaa	Stomach crunches - about 100 per trip to the gym. Also twiststs. Hold weight in front of body and twist to the right and to the left. You can also do this with a machine. Hold cable to you left side. Hold handle with both hands.  Twist body to the right .  Repeat 20 times. Turn around and do the same thing to the left.  <br>  Try changing what you are eating. Eat 5 smaller meals each day instead of just 3.  Also cut out starches, potatoes, rice, pasta, white bread, etc.  Stop drinking gatorade, energy drinks and the double latte at Starbucks.

TzaD0CYVaa	Not eating after 6pm is a good idea for anyone that is trying to lose weight, although due to many peoples lifestyles this will not work. If you do need to eat after 6pm, ensure that is low carb and high protein.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is that your body's Metabolism slows down when it's sleeping, so it digests things slower. Carbs digest slowly even without a slowed Metabolism, so WITH the slow Metabolism, they end up not getting completely digested and end up stored as extra fat.<br>  <br>  People who eat after 6pm tend to make bad choices as well - chips, soda, chocolate while they watch tv......my husband stopped eating food after 6pm in January of this year (along with other lifestyle changes) and managed to lose 78 lbs - living proof it assists you in weigh loss!|`|WuSuus6jaa	no not all the time<br>  <br>  bc you should eat 4 hours beofre going to bed, so the your mutablusim can burn it.<br>  <br>  but if you do it like 1 hour before going to bed, then yes that will tuen into fat. =]|`|MClFrDE1aa	Not true.

When you go out to eat cut the portion in half and put in a to go plate.  Eat 5 smaller meals a day instead of 3. Do not try to starve yourself to lose weight. <br>  Now the exercise part. Get moving.  Ride a bike, walk on treadmill, swim, walk in pool, hike, walk a mile or two each day (brisk walk, not a stroll).

If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a><br>  |`|riFCllZIaa	Drink lots of water and watch the calories and watch the SERVING SIZE TOO :o
t8utvEZIaa	A cheese omelette is around 300 calories,<br>  - the eggs in omelettes are good for you, but try using the whites of the eggs its healthier and tastes the same, <br>  - a bit of cheese is good for a balanced diet, but its very fattening so try and use a smaller amount... or instead of cheese, why not try things like onions? they add a bit or flavor and crunch or have a side salad with the omelette?<br>  - If you want to make the omelette healthier try a lower fat oil, olive oil is one of the heart-healthy fats, or coconut oil is quite nice|`|sDVJvg8Zaa	It's good protein,that's all I can tell you.|`|e68b22a4892a43457f773b8e0670573faa	If you are watching your diet , you can eliminate the fat in eggs by eating egg whites .

Better than the cheese. |`|AA11230809	fattening but its high in protein which is good for you. idk if it will help you loose weight.|`|4FquG0tlaa	I eat omlette as a low calorie meal. One egg can range between about fifty and eighty five calories depending upon size so an omlette of two eggs would be between one hundred and one hundred and seventy calories plus oil which should be lessw than fifty if you don't use much (you really don't need a lot). However, the amount of cheese you use will obviously effect the calorie content and I know little about cheese calories. I tend to flavour my omelette with salt and pepper and have it without the cheese and it really is still very yummy! Also, put a bit of water in the mix. Only a tiny bit. It makes it bigger in volume and thus makes you feel you are eating more. Happy Omeletting. X|`|nYcQvpxAaa	If it's part of a balanced diet, it's fine. Use olive oil or Pam instead, or some spray margerine. And, DON'T use that NASTY processed cheese! No "american" or "singles", I don't even use Kraft cheese. I buy a block of fresh Irish cheddar, gouda, and other higher quality cheese from a deli. It's made with fresh ingredients and no junk it. It costs the same too. They usually keep it in little baskets in the deli areas. I get Kerrygold brand. You could get deli Swiss too. I only buy fresh butter too, Plugra or Kerrygold. The ingredients are "Cream, salt" That's it! Compare a pack if it to that nasty oil based junk! <br>  <br>  Also, you could use eggbeaters if you want. I use fresh organic free range eggs, they're far better tasting and healthier!<br>  <br>  If you have some ketchup with your omelette it will help too, loaded with antioxidents! Add in some vegetables if you want to make it healthier. Fresh tomatoes, herbs, spinach, etc. Peppers are very healthy.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|jtmCyqsiaa	Oil - depends on how much you used.<br>  2 eggs- 140<br>  1 slice of american cheese - 70<br>  <br>  So, yeah it's not bad, as long as you don't use a **** load of oil. <br>  You're better off using spray butter with zero calories.<br>  If you're trying to lose weight, that is.|`|tYYFZKUsaa	use egg whites only and try to use a lower fat oil and 2 percent cheese if any cheese at all.But remember only egg whites it will cut down on the fat!|`|cgZmuozbaa	eggs in general are fattening...because of the yolks<br>  <br>  try just an egg white omelet to avoid a lot of unnecessary fat<br>  <br>  
nYcQvpxAaa	Just like everyone else said, all it will do is tone the muscle underneath. You have to do cardio and eat right to get rid of the fat so you can see the muscle. THEN you tone the muscles.<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  |`|3YJbVYaHaa	Get this straight, you can do 1,000 sit-ups a day and still not see a six-pack, you know why? it's because everyone has a six-pack but the layer of fat on top of it hides it!!!!!! so start with lowering body-fat first and doing sit-ups and you will see results!!!!!!|`|MF9YknDYaa	or what if you do 95 sit ups,will it not work?.Spot reducing is not possible.|`|WQawJ0kKaa	actually, if you want to lose fat off of your stomach, you should run daily.  doing situps will tone the muscles there, but the running will get rid of the fat covering those muscles.|`|xL9EpNctaa	you will not get a flat stomach just by doing sit ups.

Make sure you are eating a healthy diet with good balance of protein and complex carbs.  <br>  Sit ups, crunches, leg raises, abdominal twists all work on these muscles but do not burn that fat in that particular area specifically. That is where the diet comes in. Also try walking on the treadmill with weights in your hands.  That works on the core muscles too. |`|S2fHcqGAaa	My wife has tried everything to lose weight but nothing has worked just as good as the wu yi tea that she drinks, it's been covered on CNN and Fox News.

Something in the caffeine that inhibits fat burning. I'd never heard that before but that's what he said. Odd that so many diet pills have caffeine isn't it? And no one ever loses weight with them. Maybe there's something to it.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Not when you put four sugars and some steamed milk in it. Coffee itself is not going make you lose weight. More activity and less calories makes you lose weight. |`|9u3ocNuqaa	No. Coffee does not make you loose weight.
dfcCoGwRaa	Start following a non-processed (no canned/packaged foods, no artificial ingredients added, such as high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, etc.) diet as best as you can, based around a macronutrient ratio of 40% protein, 30% carbohydrates, and 30% fats (no trans fat).<br>  <br>  Have around 5+ meals a day to speed up metabolism. Fad diets are one of the worst things you can do. Decrease your caloric intake as well, start 500 calories lower than usual and decrease by 10% each week until weight loss occurs. Make sure you get a sufficient amount of water each day and regular exercise as well.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend weightlifting 4 times a week, heavy weights and less repetitions (less weight and more reps toning is a BS myth, 6-10 reps is a good range). For cardio, look into High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). It should be done about 3 times a week on off days from weightlifting.

As it is, females don't produce nearly enough testosterone to get bulky without the use of steroids.<br>  <br>  Work all the muscle groups by making a split routine, and don't work the same muscle group two days in a row, each muscle group should be given 48 hours rest minimum before working it out again.<br>  <br>  You should have a good source of fast-digesting protein after a workout (both cardio and weightlifting), such as whey, mixed with water for fastest digestion. Here's a good split:<br>  <br>  Monday: Deltoids, Triceps<br>  <br>  Tuesday: HIIT<br>  <br>  Wednesday: Traps, Back<br>  <br>  Thursday: Legs, Forearms<br>  <br>  Friday: HIIT<br>  <br>  Saturday: Chest, Biceps<br>  <br>  Sunday: HIIT|`|Aej3lgQZaa	become bulimic.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Change your workout and your cardio.  Instead of running 4-5 miles try biking one day, hiking in the woods/across park one day and then swimming one day, then go on the treadmill another.  Do aerobics, tae boa workouts, interval training etc.<br>  <br>  Same kind of thing with your weight training.  Change it up. Ask a trainer what are some different exercises you can do for the same body parts. Chest for instance do push ups only for a couple of weeks. Regular, military style, decline, V position, Clap push ups - All to max reps. Alternate in between each set of chest exercises with chin ups, wide grip pull ups, close grip pull ups, reverse grip pull ups, <br>  Just enough rest between each exercise to write down how many reps you did and then go to the next. <br>  You will see results quick. <br>  Do this for about 3 weeks then change it up again.  Keep your body guessing what is coming next. You will lose some weight and get in better shape.  |`|wnz7IL6jaa	Eat healthy meals 4-6 a day. meal, snack, meal, snack, meal, snack. Stick with whole grains, veggies, low-fat cheese and dairy, nuts (almonds) berries, spinach or arugula, turkey, plain oatmeal. Your work out sounds fine. |`|NLeqnZM1aa	eat whatever you want but cut the amount in half. for example, if you eat a burger and fries choose one, not both. and stay active and dont eat after 6 pm|`|7NPkmH00aa	Eat apples whenver you feel like eating or oranges, they're all natural and mostly water with few calories, most fruit/vegatables are a good choice though...thats usually what i do when im feeling chunky|`|JxNUrtuWaa	eat about 6 little meals throughout the day to keep your metabolism running fast, and keep on exercising 
OfuB4UnDaa	Keep running the more you try the further you will be able to go. Don't think over night you will be able to run 7 blocks. But i bet if you try every day for a week you will be able to do maybe two blocks. Keep it up way to go wish you luck.|`|Fhtzok3Baa	Do what you can and build up slow.  Lift weight also if you want to burn fat effectively.  When you're ready you can try the Fat X workouts.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Don't run around the block, jog around the block. When you start getting winded slow to a brisk walk.  As you start to catch your breath, start jogging again. When you get winded slow to a brisk walk. Keep this up and you will see that the jogging gets longer and the walking gets shorter. <br>  Start really looking at your diet. Cut out all the junk food, sodas, extra helpings, etc.  When you go out to eat cut the portions that you are given in half.  Eat the first half of the meal. Put down your fork and drink a full glass of water.  If you are still "hungry" eat some more. Key word there is hungry. Not just because it is there. Take the rest home for leftovers. <br>  At home try using a smaller plate to put your food on. Smaller portions fit on smaller plates. Don't go back for that extra. <br>  |`|9EA3zdR2aa	i had this very same problem, but realized recently I was trying to run way too fast.  Try it at little more than walking speed, and you'll see its easier.  Don't be scared you're not going fast enough or something, because the best way to lose weight is to keep your heart rate sustained at a high level for a long period of time, not to burst your heart rate very fast at first then bringing it down.  Set distance goals for yourself, and keep increasing it gradually.  It is a process and will take time, but once you start to see results, and you will, you will feel great about yourself.  |`|bZDzSfuRaa	It takes time for your body to adjust. Start slow and eventually you will be able to run longer distances.  Don't over exert yourself you could wind up pulling something. Keep at it!
pcGgavNtaa	Your weight loss or gain will depend on how you are working out. You say 1-2 hours a day 5 days a week is pretty hard.  An hour should do the trick if you are not standing around talking most of that time.<br>  First off make sure you  eating smaller portions and get rid of the junk food, sodas, sugar etc.<br>  2nd - The workout should be using light weight - 12-15 reps with the last two reps difficult to complete. If they are too easy increase the weight. 2 sets of each exercise. <br>  Aerobic exercise should be treadmill, swimming, biking, hiking, etc. Alternate these in during the week. Find your typical exercise heart rate. Now when you are doing any of the aerobic exercises try to go about 10 beat higher on your heart rate (use heart rate monitor).  Do this for 2-5 minutes. Then slow down to normal exercise heart rate. Continue for 2-5 minutes.  Repeat.  This will require that you walk faster/uphill on treadmill, faster pedaling on bike, etc. This will keep your body burning calories long after the workout is over. <br>  Weigh yourself on the same scale. Do not expect to see results immediately. You will see that your clothes are fitting different before you see a big weight loss.  Keep at it. |`|A1apawRvaa	You r probably building muscle and muscle weighs more than fat...|`|Vw1KJ3VWaa	measure yourself and, if you're like my girlfriend, keep track of your pants size.  my gf is more concerned about what size she is wearing than what the scale says -- lower size means that her body composition is fixing itself.<br>  <br>  I do the same thing, but with my belt notches.  I'm on notch 3, need to be on 5 or so.  I can make it to notch 4 but its uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  the other thing- if you're focusing on DOING the right things, the size will fix itself (but your weight may or may not go down, depending how much muscle you add).|`|oL4IU5G3aa	Make up your mind do you want to lose weight or fat?They are different,To lose weight it comes off in this order,<br>  Water<br>  Muscle<br>  Fat<br>  To lose fat you need to burn it in energy.<br>  You may gain muscle which is heavier than fat,healthier than fat and doesn't wobble as much when............. you can fill in the gaps lol stick with it great stuff this site might be of help

Try eating 4-5 small meals a day. They should consist of protein (2-4 oz.) and a complex carbohydrate. Veggies.  You can get protein from meat, nuts, beans, etc. <br>  You might want to ease of skating some and do some other exercises such as walking, swimming, treadmill, plyometrics, core exercises etc. This will "shock" your body and get it burning the calories. Right now you body says, "Ok we are going to skate for a couple of hours, so lets coast along. <br>  Also some light weight training will help as well.

The muscles are sore because they being broken down and building up again. <br>  Go at about 80% of what you have been doing. Should feel better in a couple of days. |`|aWX48MG9aa	take a bath and don't work out till it feels better duh.<br>  <br>  It hurts because when you work out you make microscopic tears in your muscles if you work out to much it will start to hurt.|`|WhtZeGmuaa	get some icy hot
V7lGsaR8aa	Don't Laugh !|`|13k2WKx8aa	Describe a tight chest. Like it feels like something is constricting you? Difficulty breathing?<br>  <br>  It could be muscle related I suppose. Asthma can also do this, but since you say it's only when you laugh, it's more likely to be muscle related.<br>  <br>  Not to scare you, but just because you're 16 does not mean it's not heart related.|`|j6sDX5H9aa	yeah i do not know, but you should see a doctor

YLYAo2zmaa	Most likely, the condition that she needs surgery for is affecting her hormones and causing some depression, give her some extra loving attention and pamper her. This is a really painful surgery and she is going to need lots of help.

A know loads of woman in my family who have had their tubes removed due to our history of ovarian cancer.<br>  speak with your doctor about death rates if your concerned, and please, support your mother.|`|rxUZqmNRaa	My wife had hers removed 2 years ago for medical reasons. She's perfectly healthy, had hers removed laproscopically and went home the same day.

AA10350894	If this is the extent of what he does, I would say it is kinda creepy and he is probably doing it to get your attention, but I don't think I would call it stalking.<br>  He may be bringing these things up in some half baked attempt to show you that you have similar interests as he dose. If it bothers you, maybe you should make it widely known that you are not interested in him.|`|af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	This sounds pretty weird, in my opinion it's leaning toward the "stalker" side of things.|`|fX6QYdxIaa	Are you sure you are in college?  Reading this scenario I would have guessed you at about 14.  Grow up and talk to the guy. Then you can decide if he is attracted to you and trying to capture your attention, or if he is a psycho.|`|AA12240848	maybe he's shy and like another said, he may be interested in asking you out. maybe you could talk to him, and if he still seems creepy, tell him you aren't interested. good luck!!!|`|E23s2wSNaa	maybe your friend talk to him about u, cause hes prolly always wondereing about u, and this is sort of like stallking, but not a whole lot, and hes not lurking outside ur window so thats good
FEAeTMnfaa	Brownish blood at the beginning or end of your period is normal.  I have never heard of orange menstrual blood, though.  When I first went on birth control pills, the first few months my period was a little unpredictable, and would sometimes come early or spot in between, and I would often have that brownish blood at first.  If you are concerned or have any pain, though, you should call the doctor who prescribed you the birth control to see if they think it is worth being concerned about.<br>  <br>  However, I think it doesn't sound like anything to be worried about.|`|4dtUsaYhaa	brown blood is old blood. when i first started my period on a new pill , my whole period was pretty much brown. It doesnt really matter on the colour, each day could be different.
0kWkX8yiaa	stomach flu, yes|`|AA11846603	First of all, the flu is a respiratory problem.  You probably are just getting a case of gastroenteritis|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Nobody here can really say.It could be a variety of ailments...it doesn't have to be viral.<br>  <br>  It could be the flu (although children are more likely to develop nausea/vomiting than adults) or it could be because of Norwalk virus (no such thing as the "stomach flu")<br>  <br>  If it is noro, here are prevention tips for next time:<br>  <br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|86VgnUmQaa	It sounds like it could be a flu, or maybe just gas. I've had things like this before. Best idea is to just drink lots of water, take it easy, and just wait it out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you, and I hope you get better.
w8xJGEJCaa	the mole doesn't make a difference<br>  try asking your doctor about perscription deodorant, i know it sounds sort of silly, but everyone i know (that uses it) says it helps so much and they never have to worry about sweat stains, smelling bad, or even sweating (under the arms). <br>  you could also try the dove clinical strength deodorant, but your best bet would just be to ask your doctor or dermatologist about the perscription kind.|`|JMngC5lTaa	hahaa hehe thats well funny hahaha ... no disrespect :S sorry i havent a clue ...
iLrp65oXaa	Find a way to make yourself hate it.  I read Fast Food Nation.  I usually re-read it every year.  The fast food industry is pretty evil and I don't want a cent of my money going to them.|`|VdOVNtBWaa	i'm pretty sure it's not true, but i heard a rumor that mcdonalds uses human sperm to preserve their fries. i'm sure it's not true but just think of that next time you get a craving for mcdonalds. worked for me, now i can't even stand the smell of that place|`|nzWux9Meaa	I can't really give you advice on how to stop eating McDonald's, but I can give you a few incentives. First off the majority of fries that are made are expired and I will explain to you why. The fries are only safe to eat for seven minutes after they are made and a lot of times the fries are still used when the time limited goes over seven. Another thing are the fried chicken and fish products which get dropped sometimes when transporting them to your meal bag and are usually just picked right up and used. The final thing that I have noticed is that McDonalds has a policy that their employees have to wash their hands every half an hour, but I have yet to see anyone at all do this. Today I saw, for the third time, someone sneeze on their hands and just continue working the burger assembly line. All of these things disgust me and I would never do that to any customer.|`|UAF8Zxzaaa	Give yourself some rules.... Depends how often you eat there. For example, if you eat there every day (I doubt that), start with 'I can only eat something from Mcdonald's 3 times a week'. And stick with it until you have it down. Be very strict, count every time you go there even if you get barely anything. And then lower the days more and more. And then reduce the sizes of things like fries and such. Or just go cold-turkey, realize you're wasting your money. I did this with soda/pop. You stop craving it after a week or two. You can eat it every now and then, but make a guideline like no more than once a week ever.|`|AchBHSGfaa	If you want to stop eating mcdonald eat allot of fresh meat then you will lose test of the fries
OhoYD9I9aa	It works for some people. It is a good over the counter sleeping aid. I personally have built up an immunity to unisom, tylenol pm, other over the counter sleeping pills. There is less chance of becoming dependent as It is not chemically addictive, however anything can be psychologically addictive. But as I said for someone who just needs a little help and doesn't want to see their doctor, it is worth the try.|`|Jjh16FoHaa	So, UNISOM is the ingredient in the common drug "Benydryl" that makes you sleepy. <br>  <br>  It's an Anti-histimine, which means it stops allergic reactions.<br>  <br>  But it also has the bizzarre side effect that it makes people drozy. <br>  <br>  One of UNISOM's marketing methods is that the same ingredient is found in other medicines, such as "Tylenol PM" but that comes with Acetomophen (tylenol or Paracetemol). It should be said that, that is realitivly the safest drug in the world to take, however could be fatal if overdosed (but hey?!? What couldn't?).<br>  <br>  One of the problems with UNISOM as a sleep aid is that it can give the symptoms of a "hangover" the morning after. This actually makes a case to opt for the Tylenol PM instead, because at least you are getting some headache help along the way. <br>  <br>  if someone has true need for sleeping drugs (and let's admit, they are over abused) they might be better off witha  perscription like Ambien, which is more effective and doesn't give the hangover side effect. It is however more expencive and is habit forming.|`|AA11579848	I have suffered with insomnia since I was twelve.  I am now 4 and still have insomnia.  I have tried everything.  I even tried unism.  These pills are often much stronger than the ones that are prescribed by my doctor.  Leaving me the next morning with a (pill hangover).  Not sure of all the ingredients, but you may want to look up the contents and so some research on that. good luck!|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Tried it, quite hungover the next day. Not worth it. Never found a sleeping pill that didn't have me dragging for a day, even two. Best thing I've found for sleep is children's chewable Benadryl. It's a low dosage, works quickly because you chew it, no tiredness the next day.
SPydoGxRaa	1. Ummmm no, but if you've been holding it in a looong time it feels good<br>  2. Our vagina gets all wet and feels hot and tight<br>  3.Because guys would never date a flithy girl<br>  4. again, guys dont like ugly girls. Also ,we girls have intense competition on who can look the best---- lots of rumors spread and backstabbing XD<br>  5. I dunno, I like videogames and i know a lot of girls who do to.|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	1. No, not really. But if you've been holding it in for ages then it's kinda nice aha<br>  2. Probably just the same as you do<br>  3. We don't like to "be so clean" we're just not unclean and would rather wash, thanks<br>  4. Usually because girls are jealous of other girls and feel they have to look good all the time, in a kind of competitive way<br>  5. Personally, i like video games!|`|PGTM31Vdaa	1. It's my favorite daily activity.<br>  2. Uhh...the same as guys? We're just...ready to go...?<br>  3. Who said we like to be clean?<br>  4. Because we're only trying to live up to the standards that guys have put up for us. That, or chicks are just obnoxiously girly.<br>  5. There are plenty of girls that do. Guys just waste a lot more time playing games than girls do. Maybe instead of playing games you should go mingle...|`|Ghu73ELNaa	1.) I didn't know guys did, but i think its a pain in the ***! <br>  2.) Feels goooood :D<br>  3.) Why would you want to be dirty???<br>  4.) Most girls and i have to say most gay guys just take pride in their appearance :D<br>  5.) We have better things to do with our time, i guess some girls do though!!|`|l1UwQRBTaa	1. Enjoy peeing? Not really<br>  2. Feel like I really could just have some s*x...When Im horn I tend to not let my boyfriend leave the house and drag him upstairs, kiss his neck alot... Feel kinda like Im loosing control and a little crazy<br>  3. Being clean is hygienic, end of. Plus, if a girl was dirty would you really be interested?<br>  4. Girls care about impressing guys, girls have the option of makeup, which makes out life more difficult!<br>  5.Video games are ok, I dont mind them, but find them a bit immature and cant be bothered with them, they just seem like a waste of time!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|QJHE3z1raa	1. no<br>  2. veryyyy goood :)<br>  3. no girl i think wants to be dirty, we feel prettier and have more confidence clean<br>  4. ^<br>  5. i love the wii<br>  but most girls dont cause they have other things they like to do(shopping, nails, etc.)|`|22hX0vDNaa	1. Yes<br>  2. it feels good but probs not as much as a guy does<br>  3. to impress the guys(usually)<br>  4. to impress the guys and girls(its true, its natural- animals do that too)<br>  5.Some girls think its childish since girls hit puberty quicker than guys do, however other girls like video games like me.|`|qTqjlHDtaa	1. haha no<br>  2. feels like your happy and you wanna have sex i guess, its good.<br>  3. not all girls are like that LMAO me nd my friends have the messiest rooms, but if your talking about showering clean, its because nobody wants to be around a person who smells lol.<br>  4. Because they just do, we want to impress girls, alot of guys just care about a girls looks.<br>  5. because we just like to do other things, idk, we have better things to do. <br>  :)|`|rwrDD14Jaa	1. Uhhh noo, I don't think we enjoy peeing at all unless we've been holding it in for like a day<br>  2. Well from personal experience I get this really strong urge to f**k someone and I feel this weird feeling in my groin area which is probably the rush of blood to my vagina <br>  3. Doesn't everyone like to be clean??<br>  4. Girls like looking good and we like the attention we get from it so that's why<br>  5. I don't know, I love video games and I'm a girl|`|aotINbL3aa	1. i dont<br>  2. when i was with my ex we just do it if we were in the mood and i do that if i am in a serious relationship only<br>  3. i love to smell good and guys like it too<br>  4. i like to look pretty<br>  5. i play if ppl are playing|`|CqldGgFCaa	1no<br>  2awesome<br>  3why not ? cuz guys are so dirty<br>  4 idk its just how we are<br>  5we care about our image to much and games can sometimes seem nerdy
rwFibnFmaa	Take a midol, or a motrin (or advil). Tell your mom you really aren't up for doing anything like cleaning your room. Take a relaxing bath.

Best thing to do is take 2 Aleve, fill up a hot water bottle and put it on the area that hurts, set an alarm for an hour to an hour 30 minutes and just try to sleep. When ever I do this, after I wake up, I feel 100x better and I can get on with my day. Good luck :)|`|S1jddreQaa	You should go take a nice warm relaxing bath/shower, and just clear you head.

Other wise take some ibuprofen.|`|uqRb9tAqaa	Try taking a bath, drinking some tea, eating a healthy meal, drinking some water, listening to some music, microwaving a heating pad and putting it on your back, reading a few chapters of a book... juts do something to relax.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	It's not necessary and contributes to the lunacy about reflux.  If you use the pillow because you like it, that's fine, but a solution to acid reflux?  That's a joke.  Acid reflux is due to bad digestion and not enough stomach acid production.  Drug companies are making billions on this fiasco.  They should be ashamed of themselves.<br>  <br>  If your child is suffering from acid reflux, try giving her or him a teaspoon of Air Dried Sea Salt each day and watch what happens.  In older people this problem is a result of the LACK OF STOMACH ACID and rotting, undigested, putrefying foods that produce LACTIC ACID, just like you find in garbage dumps and the methane gas causes the bloating.  Taking a high quality Betaine HCL made from a once living source (not a laboratory) solves the problem in less than 3 minutes and allows normal digestion to take place.<br>  <br>  That medical provider is making lots of money on this issue and will fight hard to make you believe in the indoctrination that is happening on this subject.  The truth is what it is and they should be ashamed.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|AA10450066	I'm so glad you did further research and found the answer.Thank you so much for passing it on.<br>   p.s.

9b3xkt36aa	Yes and it's called Lice.  Now before you freak out keep reading.  You can catch the things from sleeping in a hotel room that doesn't do their laundry properly!  You did nothing wrong.   Now...Crabs usually don't cause irritated skin...they're just really itchy.  Simply put...your doctor won't think less of you for coming to him if you need help and if it is Lice...it's just Nix shampoo and usually you have to do it twice.|`|WRSqs363aa	It is possible to catch them through public restrooms, furniture and sex. Itching could be other things. You should be able to see signs of crabs if it is. They are little parisitic insects that feed off your blood. you will see them or their nits. If it is crabs you can get an over the counter cream that kills them and you need to vacuum and wash all clothes, furniture etc. that you have come in contact with. Hope this helps|`|fAFXkikAaa	Yes, you can catch crabs from infected clothes and linens.<br>  <br>  But a lot of different things can cause itchy genitals - from an allergic reaction to new soap, to a yeast infection.  <br>  <br>  Go to your doctor (not strangers on the internet) to get this diagnosed.|`|7ROXROUxaa	highly unlikely<br>  it's winter...<br>  it could just be dry skin.|`|2JTBPhuuaa	Crabs are just lice in your pubes, so yeah it's possible but unlikely.

I started having wet dreams or nocturnal emmisions since I was 16. Wet dreams always happen at night while asleep. Often I'd have an erotic/sexual dream often involving a girl or occasionally a boy. At the point of orgasm I'd feel like I wanted to pee but it'd be really pleasureable kinda thing and I'd ejaculate (while still dreaming) then immediately wake up. I'd then find I have a wet and sticky mess in my pj bottoms!! I use to get WD a lot as a teen and I still get the odd wet dream now and then even at 36 (probably coz I'm a virgin still, I dunno)! I usually remember the actual dream afterwards but occasionally I wake up not remembering the dream and just discover the semenal mess in my pj's.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  David
TYFSWhh3aa	the semen builds up to the point where the body can't hold it anymore and then you ejaculate; normally while sleeping. and if you masturbate you normally don't have wet dreams because you already release the semen..
ksoMldqYaa	Gazeygoo is so wrong about that, many people get crowns without root canals.  Just tell the dentist at the next appt and maybe they will need to take another x-ray to see if the nerve has been affected.  It could just be the fact that it's a temp and they don't fit all that great so there is pain.  Don't worry about it too much until you see the dentist.|`|AA11599407	You can't have a crown, temporary or otherwise without a root canal so you have probably already had that done. Might be that the temporary just isn't fit quite right.|`|WqkhDIVKaa	Temp crowns are Just that--temporary. They can be fitting poorly & not insulated enough, etc. However, when you get the permanent crown, you should have no problems.

The high WBC indicates that she has some sort of infection and high platelets just screams out that this is not leukaemia.<br>  <br>  What needs to be done is to find out what is causing the vaginal bleeding and treat that.

4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	Primary amenorrhea affects less than 1 percent of adolescent girls in the United States. The most common causes of primary amenorrhea include:<br>  <br>  Chromosomal abnormalities. Certain chromosomal abnormalities can cause a premature depletion of the eggs and follicles involved in ovulation and menstruation.<br>  Problems with the hypothalamus. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a disorder of the hypothalamus — an area at the base of your brain that acts as a control center for your body and regulates your menstrual cycle. Excessive exercise, eating disorders, such as anorexia, and physical or psychological stress can all contribute to a disruption in the normal function of the hypothalamus. Less commonly, a tumor may prevent your hypothalamus from functioning normally.<br>  Pituitary disease. The pituitary is another gland in the brain that's involved in regulating the menstrual cycle. A tumor or other invasive growth may disrupt the pituitary gland's ability to perform this function.<br>  Lack of reproductive organs. Sometimes problems arise during fetal development that lead to a baby girl being born without some major part of her reproductive system, such as her uterus, cervix or vagina. Because her reproductive system didn't develop normally, she won't have menstrual cycles.<br>  Structural abnormality of the vagina. An obstruction of the vagina may prevent visible menstrual bleeding. A membrane or wall may be present in the vagina that blocks the outflow of blood from the uterus and cervix.|`|k7tavXzbaa	never in their life can only indicate that they don't have reproductive organs<br>  and if very active or very underweight they may stop for a while|`|k23GYs9iaa	I have never heard of this.

YRJShhKraa	I know that eating disorders can really screw up your metabolism. It's sounds like to me you could be hypo metabolic, and no I don't believe you have to have hypothyroidism to be hypo metabolic. You should really talk to your doctor about this, and see if they can treat you for it. Hope this helps! =)

AA10882779	I know exactly what you are saying. <br>  <br>  3500 calories is 3500 calories.<br>  However, if you were to eat 3500 calories worth of apples, compared to Mcdonalds, there would be a huge differnece.<br>  <br>  You see, fat sticks to you. 3500 calories worth of Mcdonalds would still only be one pound, but it will make your body look worse than consuming 3500 calories of apples. If you ate the apples, your appearence would most likely look the same. But with Mcdonalds, it would pay a much different affect on your body. <br>  <br>  If you were to have 3500 calories of Mcdonalds for just one day, you will not gain any weight. Trust me. But if you continued eating greesey, fattening food like it forever, compared to lean meat and fruits (and you had the exact same calories) you will gain weight.<br>  <br>  So yes, it does matter where your calories come from. <br>  <br>  As long as your eating healthy foods, dont worry about calories. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped! good luck!|`|pcGgavNtaa	Yes calories are calories as far as numbers.

On the other hand, 100 calories from 4 french fries is not healthy. It is about the fat content. Check in the labels. Some mini bagels have 100 calories with zero calories from fat while others have 100 calories with 10 calories from fat. You should not eat foods that have calories from fat more than 1/3 of the total calories too much. For example: a food with 100 cal and 40 cal from fat is not healthy.

Luego para ponerselo una ves el pene de tu novio este erecto agarras con dos dedos la punta del condon para que no le entra aire y poco a poco lo vas desenrollando hasta llegar al final del tronco (casi hasta los testiculos) Se pone antes de que el empiece a penetrarte obviamente por que si no podes quedar embarazada. Para quitarselo debe volver a tomar la punta del condon y deslizarlo cuidadosamente y hacerle un nudo para que no se derrame el semen y tirarlo donde nadie lo mire no querras que se den cuenta. Nunca se debe usar el mismo condon dos o mas veces es estrictamente solo una ves. Y por favor revisen bien que no este da?ado.

9lpRiYRXaa	mira, una mujer embarazada por lo general gana peso durante el embarazo, depsues del parto aparte del peso que haya adquirido, tiene que tomar en cuenta que cuando un bebe esta creciendo durante el embarazo el útero también crece y es esa cavidad la que aloja y hospeda a los bebes, por lo tanto un útero ue creció durante 9 meses o hasta el día que nació tu bebe , se toma nada y mas y nada MENOS QUE APROXIMADAMENTE 3 MESES, y si es cesárea estarás completamente normal a los 6...por que por que aparentemente por fuera todo se ve perfecto pero en tu interior todo eso va cerrando y contrayéndose lentamente, algo que se hizo en 9 meses no puede ser normal otra vez dela noche ala ma?ana, por eso hay mujeres que ala larga tiene problemas en su matriz, esta bien comas sano así perderás peso, pero tu vientre aun no lo fuerces tanto aparte de fajarte, pues esta herido y sensible, te tomara mas tiempo, pero después de ese periodo ya puedes tramar medidas mas severas....hay quien tomas tes para desinflamar, las caderas siempre desde el embarazo se habren un poco mas preparandose para el parto, y vuelven a su estado normal, a algunas mujeres se les quedan asi, por eso algunos dicen cuando alguien no tenia tanata cadera que el embarazo le sento, espera un poco, y veras que podras hacer rutinas de ejercicios, y tomar much agua, si das pecho no puedes hacer dietas drasticas por tyu bebe que esta alimentandose de ti, pero ya en tres meses mas o menso te veras mejor, evita tacones altos, y mas si es cesarea....yaveras que poco a pcoc sentiras que ese tiempo tu cuerpo vuelve asu estado normal....|`|M2KjUpjMaa	Hola preciosa, hay libros que te hablan de ejercicios para reaizar después del parto y que te ayudarán, puedes buscar información en google.|`|EP3V1lFiaa	no deves de comer cosas heladas por que eso te va a inflamar mas el vientre untate pomadas o aceites calientitos en el vientre para desinflamar bebe mucha agua y besos a tu bb|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Hay que alimentarse bien, bajarle a los carbohidratos y hacer un poquito de ejercicio =)|`|OEvKKvjaaa	Hola: Es normal que tu cuerpo tarde en volver a la normalidad, es todo muy reciente.Para hacer ejercicio tenes que esperar hasta el 4o mes después del parto.No podes hacer dieta mientra amamantas tampoco realizar ejercicios bruscos.Lo mejor es lo que haces, usar faja y comer alimentos libres de grasas y mantener una dieta sana y equilibrada,Saludos

VHVkgzKmaa	I don't know if this is a male or female asking this question, but honestly, you can't generalize like that. I act the same way I always do regardless if I'm on my period or not. I think that for some women, it's just subconscious. They think "Oh I'm on my period. That means I should be feeling irritated and bitchy and uneasy, etc." Well, thinking that makes you act that way, and to be honest with you, the stereotype bothers me. If I'm being a *****, it's cuz you pissed me off! It doesn't matter what time of the month it is. LoL.
7q9gpQpEaa	Well, it's obviously going to come out after you're done having sex unlike in porn, where it's a good few takes edited together so that you don't see it dribbling down her leg like it unfortunately will do in real life.<br>  <br>  As far as the burning goes, that's probably because you're going a little too fast and slightly tearing the entrance or the wall of your vagina. Sperm does not have a neutral ph balance, but is actually very slightly acidic, so any cuts or abrasions will sting or ache.<br>  <br>  However, if after you've healed for a little while, and you try having some slow sex and it happens again, it could be something to do with your birth control so I suggest seeing your doctor.
biFCKGAcaa	After answering your recent question regarding K-Y Jelly I saw this question and answering. You have been advised wrongly by some of the answerer. <br>  <br>  Please do not apply K-Y jelly or any other jelly or ointment. It will only loosen the hole. Also making some procedures involving stitches is not possible and no doctor would do it. Please do not attempt any such thing. <br>  <br>  If the hole is big it will become loose further when you get Orgasm. Your partner should enjoy it as intercourse does not make it pleasurable if the vagina is tight. It is a wrong assemption to feel that tight vagina would give more pleasure. <br>  <br>  What you experience is due to weakening of the  muscles of the lower pelvic girdle, or pelvic floor—the pubococcygeal (PC) muscles. The PC muscles support the bladder, urethra, and urethral sphincter—the muscle group at the neck of the bladder that acts as a spigot for controlling urine flow into the urethra—and the vagina, uterus, and rectum. Anything that puts pressure on the abdomen can weaken or damage these pelvic muscles. To overcome this you may have to undergo KEGEL EXCERCISE, which will most remove your problem.<br>  <br>  Sexual function of Kegel Excercise -<br>  <br>  It is said that Kegel exercises make the vagina tighter. Also, after childbirth, practicing pelvic-floor contractions during vaginal sex will allow the woman immediate feedback from her partner, who can tell her whether they can feel her muscles tightening. A newly-postpartum woman—who has yet to return to sexual intercourse—can retrain her pelvic floor muscles to their pre-pregnancy strength and tone by inserting two or three fingers, or a dildo into her vagina and squeezing them with pelvic-floor contractions. Specially-designed barbells and weighted insertable devices are available for this purpose.<br>  <br>  How to perform Kegel Excercises -<br>  <br>  A popular way to identify the pelvic muscles in men and women is to stop the flow of urine midstream. This is accomplished by contracting the pelvic floor muscles. Restarting the flow of urine is accomplished by releasing the pelvic floor muscles. Once identified this way, the pelvic floor muscles can be contracted and released independently of controlling urination. Kegels are most frequently performed in sets. Here are a few techniques:<br>  <br>  -Quick pumps: do 15 reps of quick pumps, pause for 30 seconds and repeat. Start at 15 and work your way up to 100 reps two times a day. <br>  <br>  -Hold and release: contract the muscle slowly and hold for 5 seconds, release slowly. Work your way to at least 25 reps two times a day. <br>  <br>  -Elevator: slowly contract 1/3 of the way, pause, then 2/3 of the way, pause, then all the way. Do 10 reps two times a day. -<br>  <br>  For further information please see website - <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003975.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...</a><br>  and also talk to your gynocologist and she will explain you. -<br>  <br>  Wish you happy sexing -|`|A5J4Exc1aa	Sounds like the problem isn't with your vagina.

During pissing, just stop the flow as long as you can and release, again stop and release and so on. This will help you identify the same.

a6bjoXOlaa	Putting it in hurts more than you will ever know! Sorry I know I might be scaring you but I am being honest, that's what you want right? Yeah it hurts. But turning it really doesn't hurt too much. It may hurt a little the first day but other than that it won't hurt too much.<br>  <br>  At my ortho you go in once a month and get it turned for the whole month (no not 30 times) Usually about 8 times. Maybe you could see if your ortho does that..or maybe they do. I'm not sure of your situation. <br>  <br>  It will take you a long time to get used to it. You won't be able to talk or even swallow your own spit. I seriously didn't eat for the first day so eat a big breakfast! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck! :)|`|hLOYwnsUaa	I had one. And After the pain of having it put in, it doesn't hurt.  When you turn it each night.  It moves so slowly  that you really don't feel any pain b/c it only moves a little bit each time you crank it.|`|HFhNML5saa	According to my son yes.  For the first week.  Try taking a pain reliever a little while before you turn it.  Be brave:) Good luck|`|rOJfSownaa	yea. it really hurts. it hurts more than braces.
uVMlNvLoaa	It it itches or burns a lot, I'd say it's a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Try not to use a pencil... those are hard to sanitize and can spread germs very easily. Try something more plastic-y.<br>  <br>  It could be just the smell of your arousal--if you've been wearing tight clothing or have been really sweaty lately, if intensifies the smell quite considerably. Just take a shower and lightly wash with some warm water (soaps can be very irritating, use sparingly!). Be sure to wear cotton panties, as these allow your area to breathe and exchange moisture and air with your environment.|`|QJHE3z1raa	sorry<br>  but its time to tell her<br>  <br>  fishy smell = infection<br>  not very pleasant :/|`|gnhl6hXYaa	hi[:<br>  well if its just a little unpleasant odor then your fine.<br>  every girl has an odor down there.<br>  but if its pretty nasty and you itch down there then thats <br>  when i would go see a doctor. <br>  hope this helped a bit<br>  -andrea<3|`|kzGgulBDaa	i think it may just be your body's reaction to the pencil. i used to hear people saying "she smelled like sex." well maybe females give off some fluid. before you decide to worry about something, just give the pencil a break... and don't touch your vag. if it really is a problem, then i think you should go to your mom and ask her. maybe you broke your hymen (cherry)...|`|qTqjlHDtaa	okay another sign of a yeast infection is like very yellowish dischage. and don't worry like alot of people's vaginas smell. its just natural.|`|3uaIuxz8aa	You have to talk to your mom. And stop putting pencils in your vagina. That's probably how you got the infection in the first place.
uVMlNvLoaa	Protip: Put in a tampon, use some lube, and just stimulate your clitoris.<br>  <br>  It's not messy, it's easy, and it's a good stress reliever. The chemicals released from orgasm and the resulting contractions can really help with cramps, and it's a nice feel good when you're pms'ing.|`|QJHE3z1raa	dont<br>  its simply gross if you touch your vagina and see your hand all bloody|`|nLXfeQbpaa	yeah as long as the blood doesn't bother you. <br>  it won't make you sick or anything.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Yes its ok I've done it some times I think it feels better (and no I don't get blood on my hands I have a special way of doin it lol.|`|CBSt5Tkhaa	yeah but its going to be messy<br>  clean up after and wash|`|qTqjlHDtaa	yeah, but i wouldn't wanna.|`|Ghu73ELNaa	Not bad for you in anyway, maybe a little gross but when on your period is the time you want to masturbate the most!<br>  <br>  I either put a tampon in and stimulate your clit OR masturbate whilst in the shower|`|PGTM31Vdaa	Yeah go ahead. There's no rules there. Course, have have to deal with the mess of it, depending on how heavy you are. Masturbating is said to relieve stress and cramps, so why not? Though you could just wait a week...|`|PTsuqdJhaa	lol  yes it is definitely alright to masturbate during your period.  That is when your hormones are mostly high, so many women prefer it while menstruating.
PTsuqdJhaa	i would believe 18 is when women stop growing altogether.|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	Everyone seems to have said 18 with other numbers.<br>  So I'm guessing it's 18.|`|qTqjlHDtaa	i heard 18 or 21|`|OF7ZHq19aa	my boobs got pretty big when I was 12 well for a 12 year old any ways they havnt goten any bigger and I'm 22 now
yFX0mdOhaa	I don't think it's gross, just natural.  It's not unhealthy either, that's a myth... in fact, it reduces the females menstrual symptoms and cramping.|`|QJHE3z1raa	really?<br>  are you kidding me?!?!<br>  <br>  thats DISGUSTIIIIINGGG|`|hHGNE0IRaa	I didn't mind as long as it didn't smell weird.

But on the rare occasion that I am, the mess it is usually very minimal as when you get turned on the bleeding will actually slow. Of course we do not engage in oral out of personal preference. As for it being dangerous, it's only dangerous if you use it as an excuse not to wear a condom. <br>  <br>  "The myth that sex during your period is dangerous originates largely from religious texts. Scientifically, however, there is no reason not to have sex during your period. In fact, sex while you are menstruating can help ease the symptoms of PMS if you achieve orgasm. An orgasm releases endorphins, natural painkillers and mood enhancers, which can help with the cramps, headaches, mild depression, and irritability sometimes associated with periods."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/sexualhealth/101/specialist/berman/sex-during-period.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.everydayhealth.com/sexualheal...</a>|`|3zxVzPBxaa	its in NO WAY UNHEALTHY. Its not going to rip a hole in your uterus or anything crazy. <br>  It depends how horny the guy is and if you already got him going, and to be honest yes, its messy and its alot more fun when you are not on your period! but if you really want to, just do it with a towel underneath the both of you and i promise there will be no extra mess.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	Mostly I think people are over reacting.  I did it when my flow was minimal.  We kept a towel under me.  Our hands did get a little messy, but we only realized when we were done and i had bloody hand prints on my hips.  it washes off.  <br>  things that can be passed by blood can be passed by your own "juices" too.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't expect to receive oral then, nor would i expect to give it if he's bloody.|`|YrgDYOixaa	Gross.  Unhealthy.  unsanitary.  big turn off|`|ESd9hk21aa	I've never done it during my period. I would be scared to leave blood everywhere, very unattractive.|`|RE0ICQLUaa	That is absolutely revolting.

Has a problem with all the blood being all over him and knowing that it is period blood. Plus it would be super messy and ew and blech. Course he has a friend that has done it with a couple of chicks while they were perioding. I guess it's just how desperate you are... Wait a week please?|`|hi1eqrXwaa	well shoot im not gonna lie, i've done it before. it's seriously not what you think at all. before i was like eww that's nasty, i would never do it..and it would be too messy. it just feels like your super wet. blood doesn't squirt out or leak or anything like that. the only "messy" part about it is when i go to wipe myself up, there's blood all over the tp and my b/f's condom. that's it..|`|uVMlNvLoaa	I'm a girl, and I don't like it, because if he goes from vag to mouth I really dislike the taste of blood. And it's more messy than non-period sex because the blood can drip and stain much worse than juices.<br>  <br>  Other than that, there's nothing -wrong- with it. It's just personal choice.|`|nKruEEuhaa	Why do you care if boys like it? If you don't like it, don't do it.

uVMlNvLoaa	You sound like you might be having a hormonal imbalance, or polycystic ovary syndrome at the worst. Or it could be just nothing, like growing pains.<br>  <br>  If you've been having normal periods and this 2-3 month blip just appeared, I would go talk to your doctor about it, something might be out of balance with your endocrine system.<br>  <br>  If you're gained a lot of weight, have dark hair on your stomach or nipples growing recently, or awful cramps, I'd bet on polycystic. It's treatable, but not curable. Either way, I'd go see your doctor about your amenorrhea (lack of period) and see what's going on.
P3kIkuyVaa	go and see your doctor asap|`|U3qTwOOIaa	it could be piles - have you been constipated|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Hi Jazinda, don't worry it is quite possible you have what they call piles which are very common an most people get them at some time.<br>  They can be treated with a cream just see your local chemist.  Anusol the green one is very good the purple one is a bit heavy (thick) another one or try Preparation H there are quite a few brands. or you could use a suppository which will also help reduce the swelling. If it has not gone down after about a week then go an see your doctor to prescribe another treatment. Hope you can still sit in comfort an wish you well.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	It sounds like a possible cyst or infection from the IBS, sounds like Piles. Where lumps appear around the anus and can make it irritable to sit on.|`|9Ar4lKoraa	sounds like piles, which will go away and come back etc annoying as hell but like a handbag you have to carry around all the time!!|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	It's hemorrhoids

PGTM31Vdaa	Yeah, a lot of girls have trouble reaching orgasm through sex. The reason is is that there's not enough clitoral stimulation to reach the climax. You should try different positions that rub up against your clit. Those might help. Also you can massage it yourself during sex or your guy can do it. If sex just doesn't do it for you, you could try oral or something of the like to help you out. It may take time to find what works, but it's worth it!|`|IFd94XDkaa	Only 10% of women are able to orgasm during penetration and even then it's because they've managed a position that gives them clitoral stimulation.  Your vagina only has feeling in about the first 2 inches so you can continue to try to find a position that will do it for you but meanwhile you can get your man to give you an orgasm before penetration.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	a lot of foreplay helps.  practice on yourself first.  it's all in the mind.|`|i5lcWLm5aa	It's true, many women have a very hard time having an orgasm during sex. The easiest way for me is masturbation, clitoral stimulation. Vibrating toys help. Oh, and when you learn more about how your body works and what works for you, teach him how to do oral well, that is a great way to involve him.<br>  Also, don't get frustrated trying the first time it may take a while, my first time took me and hour and a half.|`|lFZwChJmaa	Most women never have an orgasm through sex! Those who do are lucky! It's actually really common not to orgasm during sex for women, lots of girls find it hard and some never achieve an orgasm through intercourse! Not fair eyy lol. Just try and relax, research on the internet for some tips on how to orgasm (positions etc..). <br>  Most women find they have their first orgasm using a sex toy and it helps in their sex life aswell<br>  x
1aE0ws4xaa	Almost any kind of toothbrush will work. A soft but strong bristled toothbrush works really great because it can hold together over the metal but won't hurt your gums if they are irritated or something from new or tightened braces.Electric ones might hurt your teeth after you get braces on or tightened, so Stick with the other one! I have braces and it is so important to use a toothbrush all over your mouth. Gums, tongue, teeth, and the roof of your mouth. I use a soft but strong toothbrush and for the past 6 months that I'vee had braces, it has served me well! Good Luck and braces hurt sometimes!

Since you are getting your braces soon here is some information. Take a painkiller after so it doesn't hurt after 4-6 hours. It doesn't hurt when they put them on.

yVbguDvbaa	I also had your prob when I was a teen. My doctor told me to do keegle exercises.  Those are the muscles you use when you are trying to hold your urine before you go to the bathroom.  After doing those exercises for about a month, the noises stopped.  The exercises are also good to do for the future also, they help in labor and delivery.  Hope that helps!

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	The Depo Provera shot is one of the worst jokes the medical industry has put on women in America today. If it weren't so awful it would be worth laughing. DO NOT GET THAT SHOT.<br>  <br>  The manufacturers have NO conscience regarding the problems it is causing. Profit is their only motivation for giving this to you and all others, not your health. The statistics bear this out.<br>  <br>  Here are copies of 5 exact, unedited posts of girls here on Yahoo Answers: maharette_sik<br>  <br>  Member since:<br>  May 22, 2008<br>  This is not a ?tion but a statement about the bad side effects of the Depo Shot!!!!!!?<br>  I have been off of the depo shot for 8 years. After I first got off the shot about 2 or 3 months later my periods became unfrequent. I would have major cramping and sickness but no blood. Some times I would be 2 weeks late. Other times It could be a full 6 months late. For the last 2 years I have been tring to have a baby. For the last 2 months I have been discharging milk and having cramps so bad I loose my lunch. I would have a lot of pregnancy symptoms only to find out I was just late. I was having faulse pregnancies. The depo I took can take any where from 2 months to 10 years to leave your system till you can get pregnate. In extream cases it can also leave you unfertile. Not to scare you but I found out Im one of thoes extream cases. I was only on the shot for 1 year when I was 16 now Im 22. Because I took it at such a young age I doubt I will ever be able to have a child. If I ever do have a child it will be a miracle on my part. Dont let this happen to you or anyone you know. If you do have a child later and its a girl dont let her ruin her life. Keep her off of birth control. You have no idea how it feels to be so young and know you can never give your loved one the child they deserve. A child to carry on their name. To know you are the last of your line just beacuse the doctors and society told you to be safe and take the shot or pills. Anyone saing diffrent can go to kiss their own butts. <br>  <br>  ANOTHER post: "virginia"<br>  <br>  be careful with that thing... i did it once and never again.. my friend told me that she's been using the shot for a while and when she got off it to have a baby she just couldn't get pregnant even now and it's been years... i heard that after like the 9th shot that thing just starts to steralize you.<br>  <br>  ANOTHER POST: "kaybee"<br>  <br>  i had that injection and it caused my pcos to flare up and gain alot of weight i didnt have cysts until i had that that was my first shot too!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another Post: by Lucy J <br>  Member since:<br>  October 28, 2008<br>  <br>  I was on depo provera for a year and I didn't get my period for two and a half years!! My doctor told me after a year that studies have shown that depo provera can cause osteoporosis. I went for a bone density scan and I had a very low bone density My doctor highly recommended I stopped using it. After I stopped using it I had hormonal and ovulation problems. I then went on the pill just to get my normal menstrual cycle back. I had unprotected sex while on depo provera and didn't get pregnant. However my friend who was also on it for a bout two year got pregnant twice!! In my experience I wish I never used it, but I think you should see your doctor... I just found a journal article too about its link to decreased bone density in adolescents.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another Post: by half_bre... <br>  Member since:<br>  October 11, 2008<br>  First of all, you need to RUN not walk from the needle that has the depo provera in it. The shot is extremely dangerous to us women. FDA should be brought down for approving such a horrendous 'medication'. <br>  <br>  <br>  In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (PL-99-660) that among other things required healthcare providers to report vaccine reactions to a centralized reporting system. As a result the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to which parents, physicians and vaccine manufacturers could report adverse events was created. NVIC has assisted many parents in reporting adverse events following vaccination as many doctors refuse to make a report.<br>  <br>  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONLY 1% - 10% OF ALL DOCTORS REPORT A SEVERE HEALTH PROBLEM THAT OCCURS AFTER A DRUG OR VACCINE IS GIVEN TO A PATIENT. It is simply NOT in their best interest to do so.<br>  <br>  To see the VAERS data on people that died from vaccinations. Babies SIDS within 0 to 5 days of being given vaccinations. 3006 deaths reported due to the vaccinations.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  Please understand that drug companies are profit driven, not health driven. Last year, the government paid out $1.5 BILLION dollars to victims of vaccination problems. Each vaccine a drug company, like Merck develops, they get a revenue stream of over $1 Billion dollars for it. Is it any wonder they have a huge incentive to convince you and others that it's a good thing?<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent video for you to see. This will give you incredible incite into what vaccinations are all about and help you make an informed decision on what to do:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/inde..." rel="nofollow">http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/inde...</a><br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|1aJjFrUCaa	Ok, im also on depo.. && depo messed up my periods majorly. i had to get off of depo bc i started havin bad back pains and alot of bone loss from depo. i've been off depo for just about a year and my periods are still NOT back to normal...depo is very dangerous. i bleed for like 2 days then i'll stop then like 2 weeks later i'll bleed for a couple of days and stop. they're really out of wach. so yeah depo messess up your periods. BAD.
aMHIA7XMaa	The doctor will probably give you a full physical, including a PAP test. You will have to get your body looked at, but relax - doctors are professional and sensitive about these things.<br>  <br>  The pills are $20-40 and you get them at the pharmacy.<br>  <br>  Weight gain can happen, but only 10-15 pounds at most. Different brands of the pill can have different side effects for you, so if you are having a problem you can switch brands until you find one that is right for you.<br>  <br>  Birth control pills can actually improve acne.<br>  <br>  The patch is better if you don't think you can remember to take a pill every day. Their effectiveness is basically the same.<br>  <br>  From personal experience, my periods were just the same after going off the pill as they were before going on the pill. While on the pill, they were lighter and shorter.|`|iB22RWkGaa	Okay, when I went to the doctor to get on the pill they wanted to do a papp but I said hell no! So they didn't. <br>  <br>  Mine were about $50 a month. Pharmacy<br>  <br>  Depends what kind you're on, but I didn't gain anything. <br>  <br>  No, a lot of birth control pills actually help with acne. <br>  <br>  I prefer the pills. <br>  <br>  No, my periods are lighter and the cramps are like half as bad as they used to be.|`|rKUHRKz1aa	1. what kind of check will the doctor do?<br>  Most doctors do the pap smear and to check to make sure there are no abnormalities<br>  2. how much are the pills and were i get them?<br>  You can get pills any pharmacy and in some places planned parenthood. The cost varies, also depends if you use your insurance. Be warn through, some insurances might not pay for BC if you are the dependent on the insurance plan, so call your insurance company first<br>  3. will it make me gain weight<br>  It varies from woman to woman<br>  4. will i get more acne?<br>  Again this varies, in some cases it does and in some cases, it might help even clear up some acne<br>  5. and what its better the pills or the patch?<br>  Which is better all depends on the type of person you are. If you can remember to take the pills are the same time everyday, you could go with the pills, or if you don't want to bother with taking a pill everyday, you can use the patch, but it all depends on your preference, and it might depends on which one you can handle personally.<br>  6. is it true it get more heavy when you get it back and painful?<br>  I don't want to say it again, but it does depend on you and which ever method you choose.|`|84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	You are getting "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH" from doctors that have no clue what they are doing in regard to nutrition and ALL drugs damage your body in many ways. The "pill" is synthetic hormone therapy. Did you know that when the pill was first introduced the cancer rate was at about 1 in 15 women got it, but after the pill came into the market, the rate went to 1 in 7. The drug companies realized that they were putting too much hormone in the pill, so they reduced it and this affected the cancer rate, but it is now one of the leading cancers in women. Of course, drug companies throw big money at sponsoring so called "scientific studies" at this issue because birth control is monster money for them; billions. And that is "B" for billions.<br>  <br>  The endocrine is a system of complex relationships in your body and is made up of many organs. Like a spider web that shakes the entire web when you touch one part, if you effect one organ, all the organs in the system are affected. This is why most women gain weight when on the pill. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system. The adrenal glands are a major organ that is part of that system. At puberty, when you start ovulating, the adrenal glands give up the job of making estrogen and give it to the ovaries. When you go through menopause, the job of making estrogen is given back to the adrenal glands. So after years of abuse, the pill, and these lunatic low fat diets, low salt intake, etc., the adrenal glands are exhausted and not functioning well. The tired, abused adrenals are not in any shape to take on more work, so they rebel and you get the typical menopause problems.<br>  <br>  If you believe drug companies and the FDA have your best interest at heart by allowing the "pill," you need to free yourself from the lies you believe. Do you think because your so called "side effects" you can see and feel are minimal, your health is not being compromised?<br>  <br>  Last year over 106,000 people died in hospitals from taking FDA approved drugs for the condition they had and doctors prescribed the pills legally and for the ailments they had. If you could, I think asking any one of those people they would tell you not to give them that junk if they knew they were going to die from it. So do you think the FDA and the doctors that administered those medications really cared? They are still prescribing and people are still dying.<br>  <br>  The U.S. government started a program in 1997 to document problems with vaccinations. It is now estimated that even though doctors are required by law to report problems with vaccinations, only 1% to a maximum of 10% are doing so, yet the VAERS program is showing 1,000's of cases of injury and death due to vaccinations each year.<br>  <br>  If you choose to trust these people that have a financially motivated reason for telling you "it's perfectly safe," you have an obligation to yourself to verify what they are telling you is true. If you rely on their so called "scientific studies" showing how safe they are, you need to follow the money and do your homework. If you will notice, people that are opposing this junk are not as well funded as the drug companies.<br>  <br>  In regard to your acne problems, that is a nutrition issue and doctors have NO clue about nutrition, so you will only get the "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH" from the drugs they give you. You need to address the "root cause" of the acne. Hormones play a part, but diet is the key. What happens is that you build up "biofilms" in your intestines that protect the bacteria from being damaged by your immune system. We all have hormone issues in our teens, but why do some people get more acne than others? If it were hormone only, then why don't all people get the problems universally? The reason is simple, in that diet plays a big role in not only toxic build up, but promoting weak organ function(s) in the body from bad nutrition.<br>  <br>  So to prescribe "Make Believe Health" instead of addressing the real problems is simply showing ignorance and NOT making you healthy.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you see people that understand the acne problem and get results. A Certified Nutritional Therapist can help you greatly by helping you get healthy and allowing your body to do what it knows perfectly well how to do if given the right nutrition and correct detoxing methods.<br>  <br>  good luck to you

obHa7Stuaa	Brittany, <br>  <br>  Are you going by what the scale says, or by what your clothes tell you? You have to remember that muscle weighs more than fat, so if your doing a trade-off, muscle for fat, the scales may actually tell you that your not losing, or even gaining! Keep eating clean. Keep up the exercise. it will work, just remember that it will not happen over night.<br>  <br>  Stick with it, and good luck. I'm pulling for you.

How bad is the swelling on a scale of 1/10. 1 being everyday normal and 10 being you can't see out of your eyes (along with massive pressure) and your lips are making it difficult to breathe. 5 would be difficulty seeing out of your eyes and having a very noticable difference int he side of your lips.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	Maybe you're allergic to peanuts.
RoDZZsE4aa	First, you need to stop eating simple carbohydrates and eat more complex carbohydrates, it will tell you on the label if its complex, when you look at the first ingredient. You need to eat breakfast every day and do not skip meals because that lowers your metabolism. Eat 5 smaller meals instead of 3 big meals because your body needs energy to break down food so if you eat 5 meals your digestive symtem will be "working out." Limit the amount of sugar in your diet. Stay away from food processed food that are high in salt, sugar, and trans fat. Drink a lot of water and DO NOT drink your calories-meaning don't drink coke and all that. Be more physically active in your daily life, you can start out by working for 30 minutes and then for an hour. You can also do something fun like zumba or yoga. Lift weight because it increases your metabolism and prevents you from getting osteoporosis. The maximal rate of fat loss is approximately 1% of body mass per week meaning if you weight 200 lbs. you can only lose 2 per week or else it won't be healthy. An extra 3,500 calories will make you gain one pound. I recommend to start in a 2000 calorie a day diet then if you exercise a lot you can do more calories.|`|6HxD3MkUaa	Stop eating all sugar. fat does not make you fat, sugar does. <br>  Carbs are Ok especially if you balance them with protein. but I have<br>  seen that a lot of fat people tend to snack on sugar. If you eat a full<br>  meal with plenty of protein (meat, eggs, fish, olive oil, butter, etc.)<br>  you will not feel the need to snack on foods that contain sugar.<br>  If you must eat sweet foods be smarter about it. Try fruit, Honey, Sweet wines and beers. <br>  and for chocolate try developing a taste for quality semi-sweet chocolate with 70% cocoa solids or higher. I am a professional cook and I also really love food and eat more food than anyone I know but I only weigh<br>  135 pounds and that is because I eat according to what I just told you|`|QgJKLiPlaa	I've totally been there! I'm a huge food lover also. There must be some healthy foods that you like, so, just eat more of those and cut back on the fats. I like to run, so running works for me, but a lot of people hate running. When you're exercising, always push yourself. Strive to do your best! Swimming is a great sport because it exercises all of your muscles. Maybe instead of running, do some walking or a little jogging or both! I started to cut back on the meats a little bit for a month and lost 5 pounds. Maybe just eat some healthy chicken or turkey, seriously cut back on the red meats. Ask your mom to start buying more fat free things. Crackers and fruits are always good snacking options.|`|iKh2DGCxaa	you dont have to stop eating what you like just eat less of it. for instance if you eat out three times a week, try cutting down to once and mix in more healthy foods to your diet. you can also excercise in fun ways, you can do dance classes, or swim, or go on a jog or play a sport with friends. when youre having fun its easier to excercise. and dont worry so much about what others say about you. people are always going to find something to be rude about so all you can do is worry about you and how you feel good luck :-)|`|oQs2i4Z9aa	You'll need to make some sacrifices in order to lose weight.  My advice is to get into the habit of reading the ingredients on all your food.

DSzG23WRaa	It does sound like a yeast infection kind of. I've never had a lot of discharge with the few I have had. Lots of itching and burning is what I experienced. They do sell over the counter drugs relatively cheap at the pharmacy or walmart. They seemed to work well for me with the second yeast infection I had. It's always a good idea to make sure that is what is going on, especially if you are experiencing it for the first time. I knew exactly what was going on because of my first yeast infection, and tried the OTC stuff. I completely understand the money situation, seems like everybody has limited funds these days. Talk to friends or family and see if maybe they can help you out. Try the OTC stuff if nothing else. Good luck.|`|lga42XVraa	First try changing your soap to a feminine wash product. You may be allergic to something in the soap. Give it a few days and see if that helps. Also try switching your laundry detergent to something that is hypoallergenic. <br>  <br>  I don't think you have an infection. A clear discharge is pretty normal.|`|Eec9JeXbaa	could be yeast infection...so I guess before you do anything that will cost too much  money, go to your nearest store and in the pharmacy isles, you should find a kit of a pill with applicator and cream for yeast infection - thrush.

So this may also help you too, if its not thrush that you have. <br>  <br>  bathe in some salt water, or detol. that will help for a quick fix, but not long term. since u cant go to the dr definately go to  a chemist and speak to someone there.|`|ERaIVdN8aa	Could be a yeast infection, but they're usually accompanied by clumpy white discharge and itching...<br>  <br>  Could be a lot of things....but you need to be checked out.  We can't give you any home remedies when we don't know what's wrong.<br>  <br>  Have you changed your laundry detergent, tampons, or pads or worn new underwear lately?  If so, it could be an allergic reaction/irritation.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're wearing loose cotton panties (not thongs), and you can try not wearing underwear to bed....this will discourage any bacterial growth if you have an infection.<br>  <br>  I don't have insurance either, but you can check if your area has a local free/low cost clinic.  Also, if you meet the income requirements, you could go to the local family planning/planned parenthood.  If you make less than $1604/month exams, birth control, pap tests, STD testing/treatment, HIV testing/counseling, breast exams, and routine women's care (which is what you need)....would all be free :0)|`|2wMMAKpOaa	Yes it sounds like a yeast infection as long as there is not odor to it. If you don't want to spend to much then go to almost any grocery store and pick up over the counter medicine such as Monistat, etc. Also you can go to your local health clinic and they can diagnose whatever is wrong. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  -MVP|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Are there any low income women and children health centers in your area? I was in the same predicament (not having insurance and vaginal issues) and I did some research. I only ended up paying 15$ for the appointment and I don't even have kids or am on welfare!

mX0qaX3Eaa	Is Menstration Possible after Tubal Ligation?<br>  <br>  Tubal ligation, commonly known as getting your tubes tied, is a surgical sterilization technique for women. Tubal ligation is considered a permanent method of birth control. This procedure closes the fallopian tubes, and stops the egg from traveling to the uterus from the ovary. It also prevents sperm from reaching the fallopian tube to fertilize an egg. In a tubal ligation, fallopian tubes are cut, burned, or blocked with rings, bands or clips. The surgery is effective immediately. But surgery to reverse a tubal ligation is not always effective. Reversals can be both difficult and expensive. The main question that arises after this procedure is that is Menstration [Menstruation] possible after tubal ligation? Here's the answer for that.<br>  <br>  Yes, you will still have Menstration [Menstruation] [Menstruation] after tubal ligation, it depends on the condition of the procedure. After the procedure, you will experience your normal pattern of menstrual cycles. You will still have a normal menstrual cycle since you will still have your uterus and ovaries. Sometimes you have spotting due to the effect of the surgery to the fallopian tube.<br>  <br>  The only thing a tubal ligation will do is prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. You will experience irregular periods only if you were using birth control pills and your periods were irregular before you started using them. As women age, their periods change in frequency, duration, and amount of bleeding. Whether or not you have had a tubal ligation menstrual cycle irregularity increases as you approach menopause.<br>  <br>  Tubal ligation is intended to be a permanent method of birth control. Today more and more women choose sterilization, since they know that this single procedure can provide highly effective protection against pregnancy for the remainder of their reproductive years.<br>  <br>  Tubal ligation does not decrease a woman's sexual pleasure. It closes off the fallopian tubes, where a sperm fertilizes an egg. When the tubes are closed, sperm cannot reach the egg, and pregnancy cannot happen. Sterilization does not affect femininity. It is very unlikely that sterilization will affect your sex organs, or your sexuality. No glands or organs will be removed or changed. All of your hormones will still be produced. Your ovaries will release eggs. And therefore your menstrual cycles will most likely follow their regular pattern.<br>  <br>  Tubal ligation provides no protection against sexually transmitted infections. Female condoms can reduce the risk of infection.You must consider the operation permanent. You and your partner will need no other birth control method after a successful tubal ligation. It is possible to reverse it in some cases, but your decision not to have a child in the future must be firm. Since there are risks involved in it. Tubal ligation will not cause symptoms of menopause or make menopause happen earlier. Rarely, a woman's Menstration [Menstruation] will stop after Tubal ligation.<br>  <br>  (source <a href="http://www.tarunaoils.com/articles/menstration-tubal-ligation.asp)" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarunaoils.com/articles/menst...</a>|`|6wzQhsIkaa	honey, i had it done 3 yrs ago, and i am a mess. It really messes with your hormones, so watch out.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	Yes and no.  Are your nursing?  If you're nursing your endocrine system is not preparing you to have another child.<br>  <br>  Once you stop nursing, having tubes tied does not change your body chemistry, only the pathway from your ovaries to your uterus.<br>  <br>  Normally I make some snide comment about fitness to reproduce, but I guess I'm too late in your case!|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	it is normal for you not to have a period after the birth of a child, for a little while. Getting your tubes ties does not effect your period as your period solely has to do with the shedding of your uterus.

YLYAo2zmaa	Talk to your doctor, if your anxiety is too bad, perhaps it is warranted to have some meds before hand. Or even be admitted to the hospital and have anesthesia to have the procedure done. <br>  I think you should first try talking yourself into it for a couple months. Keep telling yourself no one can hurt you now, your doctor is a professional and has no interest in you sexually and there will be a nurse in the room too. It is in your best interest to do this, for your child's sake.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	you are being your own worst enemy here, you need professional counseling.  You have a child?

Ew.<br>  <br>  I can't really explain the color. <br>  <br>  Tampons aren't supposed to hurt. Just make sure you take the plastic or cardboard thing out. If using a pad is bothering you, then yes, you should start using them. But DON'T leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours.<br>  <br>  One way to shorten and lighten your period is by using birth control.|`|Ys2CHAXyaa	Yes, I shave down there, or at least trim it, because I don't want a bush down there.<br>  <br>  My vagina is pink, but I hear in dark/ black women it varies from pink to brown.<br>  <br>  Tampons do not hurt... if you have a hymen then i guess they could break it? but I was using tampons since I was 12 and its soooo much better than pads!!!

hwZMijykaa	You can exercise until you're blue in the face and/or pass out. But if you don't change your way of eating, it won't do a thing for you! Actually, it may even cause you to gain weight. <br>  <br>  To lose weight, you need to work off more calories than you eat. Less (calories) in ... more (calories) out - is my motto. Also, make sure you're getting enough sleep (6-8 hrs worth). And if you're drinking sodas or sports drinks ... stop. Sports drinks aren't so bad and there are many that claim to have no calories ... but it's the sugar that jeopardizes your weightloss.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	You can do all the exercise in the world but you can't lose weight if your nutrition isn't good. Any reputable person will tell you the same thing.|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	Possibly.|`|MNqs6B6saa	You definitely do need to watch what you eat, but a combination of a healthy diet and exercise will help you lose some weight.<br>  <br>  You don't have to limit any certain type of food, just limit the amount you choose to eat.|`|BlMNm9Ccaa	I would say that if you are maintaining your weight with the current diet with no exercise, introducing any type of exercise would help to start peeling off the pounds|`|s8Wv50viaa	I sure you will<br>  I once ate whatever I wanted but in little quantities and lost 7 ish pounds.

G6Xcv1uhaa	Being vegan does have more to it than losing weight- but regardless, I congradulate you on going vegan! So being vegan means no animal products- no eggs, dairy, honey, etc.<br>  The diets easier than you could imagine...there's so much vegan stuff out there. Like the site 'I can't believe its vegan!' is a list of common grocery goods that are vegan. My diet is mostly whole foods though, so I typically don't eat off that list. But fruits, veggies, tofu, whole grains, soymilk is the pretty basic of it all. And its so versatile, but can also be convienent. There's a ton of natural, fast vegan foods on the market (boca products, etc) and versatile because you can make things such as vegan pizza or "cheese" cake even- endless possibilities, all cruelty free, and all delicious. Have fun being vegan! :]|`|68yjSzbxaa	Vegan do not eat any animal products or bi products of animals ( eggs, cheese, milk)  Vegan is not necessary a weight loss diet|`|OvZPHDgdaa	Actually, you don't need to diet in fact if you want to lose weight, the one diet that clearly worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today.

The roots of the upper teeth are basically right under your cheek bones.<br>  <br>   If the sinus is inflamed it can cause pressure in the tooth nerve area. I went in one time because I thought I had a cavity, and the dentist explained the whole thing. It's been about 1 year, the tooth is fine, it was basically like a ghost feeling.|`|pl4UISsFaa	Best to make another appointment with a dentist for xrays. If he/she does panorex xrays that would be even better. <br>  <br>  Sinus infections can be caused by your teeth needing dental work.|`|W9231Egtaa	sinus problems will make your teeth hurt, but if the pain is localized, it is most likely an issue with a certain tooth.  see your dentist.
EZ1cPPvkaa	Of course you already know that the best kinds of foods to eat are fruits, vegetables, and things like that, especially if your body is getting used to a higher calorie intake.  <br>  I've always gone by the rule that breakfast should be the biggest meal of your day, and lunch the second, dinner the third.  <br>  It might be a good idea to eat more than one snack througout the day.<br>  If you're aiming for 1300 calories a day, which sounds like a good goal to start with, i think a good idea would be five hundred for breakfast, and maybe four hundred for lunch and dinner each.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope your recovery goes well =)

Drnpe4T5aa	LOL - awsome question!<br>  My answer is *yes* - because you are increasing your heartrate as you said.  <br>  You burn calories when you are sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the TV.  No many, but you are burning some.  You even burn calories when sleeping.<br>  So, yes, you are burning calories when you fly.  <br>  Don't forget your bottle of water!  :)<br>  **************************<br>  Ha ha<br>  I looked it up to be able to give you actual numbers.<br>  Depending on how high your heart rate goes when you do either light (walking on level surface at 2.5-3 mph, houecleaning, table-tennis) or moderate (walking 3.5-4 mph, carrying a load, tennis or dancing) activity, you will burn either 110-160 cals (equivilant to light activity) or 170-240 cals (for moderate activity) in one hour.  If your heart rate stays elevated for the entire trip, you can really burn off some calories!  <br>  For a point of reference:  The average person burns 80-100 calories in an hour just sitting in your car driving, playing cards or sewing. <br>  Another point of reference:  My treadmill's "fat burn" mode is set at 2.5 mph.   <br>  So, depending on your nerves and the length of the flight, you can rest assured that you are buring calories!  :)|`|iKc8CjcMaa	well am too a nervous passenger on plane but love flying;but iam not sure that makes our calories burn...|`|UFdsU1iIaa	Try rhythmic deep breathing for some time before boarding the plane and during the flight.

BFYQ7lPTaa	to tone, you shouldnt focus on cardio but rather strength training...is you set the elliptical on the highest resistance/incline, this will help tone your legs. it also helps tone your arms. the treadmill is only rlly burning fat, which according to you, you dont rlly need.<br>  <br>  i suggest you stay longer on the elliptical and just get on the treadmill to get your cardio. also, start doing crunches/situps, leg ups/lunges and some weight excersizes for the arms to actually get toned.<br>  <br>  gl :)|`|ZFqz2DPRaa	Hey it's Tyrel from earlier, im on my sis's account - tyreljordan1@yahoo.com - let's tlk ;)|`|Df3gXIykaa	if youre already skinny and you want to tone up, limit your cardio to 30 minutes and the other time life weights and do ab workouts and you'll have great definition

It is great to be able to get a killer workout from home without having to buy a lot of equipment or join and go to the gym.<br>  <br>  My favorite right now is ChaLEAN Extreme.  the concept is to push to muscle failure by lifting heavy and slow.  Also the 3 phase program (I am in phase 3 now) has 2 phases where you work multiple body parts at one time.  Like lower body with upper and core and upper etc.<br>  Very effective and quite a calorie burn as well.<br>  <br>  My other favorite is a little more traditional with working 2 or 3 body parts per day.

When one "passes out" it is because of less blood to the brain/less glucose/less oxygen. None of that is fun! I seriously advice you not to try and make yourself faint.<br>  <br>  About the attention issue you have, I suggest you talk to a therapist and your parents about it. <br>  <br>  You wrote in another question; "Okay, we don't stereotype you, we say and think the truth. you are non believers (rebels) making the choice to go to hell and burn to ashes. that is not a stereotype, that is a fact. :p"<br>  <br>  Alright then.

Be sure to smile pretty for your mug shot!|`|XCn2dK1laa	Have you no shame? This is an awful question and even if i knew the answer,i wouldn't tell you.<br>  edit: I doubt it's possible because if someone made themselves pass out,they probably got a concussion from falling too hard and never did it again.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	You're a psycho. Making yourself faint is unhealthy for you duh!! Just go to the nurse saying you threw up in the bathroom or you have an unbearable headache.|`|zrk2VtPIaa	yeah, that sounds bad. the reason that you body passes out is because, for some reason, it can't get enough oxygen to your brain fast enough. thats never good, and you could permanently damage your brain. plus, if you get sick from it or someone finds out that you did it on purpose, then you'd definately get put into a hospital. and hospitals are just no fun.

PXnn6LoPaa	Sounds like you are exercising pretty well.  If you didn't do ANY exercise, I'd worry about you having extra skin and stuff (ew).  But you really could lose a lot more weight and get more energy if you up your workouts, at least until you reach your goal weight.  The bonus to exercising more is you get to eat a little more without doing any damage!  I read in Fitness magazine that if a woman gains just 4 pounds of muscle through resistance training, you will burn 150 more calories a day sitting still!|`|1L6Fqgc7aa	your matabilism slows down causing you to gain wieght. you need to diet and excersise and not one or the other|`|FEAeTMnfaa	I can tell you about my personal experience ...

You get swabed, and you're done. <br>  <br>  Don't worry at all. If you're completely relaxed you won't feel a thing. It is not at all painful.

But the dummies keep paying the price for it. Now I have to drink bottled water because I live in Thailand. But I also only pay 30 cents for 5 gallons. <br>  Animals get tapeworms from fleas. Fleas that shed digested blood are actually providing food for tapeworm larvae. Those larvae will hang out on the flea, which can be eaten by your dog when he decides to lick himself. If that flea gets in his body and is digested, the tapeworm larvae will break free and start living the high life in the lower bowels, only to be seen when your dog passes his stool. <br>  Human Infection and Prevention<br>  How humans get tapeworms largely has to do with the quality of foods you eat. Tapeworms are known to live in beef and pork. If you are served an undercooked portion of these meats, the tapeworm could still be surviving and make its way through your digestive system and into your intestinal walls. A tapeworm can also indirectly enter your body from reproduction. Some tapeworm species deposit dozens of larvae into the animal's muscle tissues. Again, if you are served undercooked meats, those larvae can hatch once they enter your body.<br>  <br>  Freshwater fish are another way people can get tapeworms. If raw sewage is pumped into freshwater, it can be transporting tapeworms from animal feces. That feces is consumed by crustaceans, which are then eaten by the fish. If you eat raw fish with these tapeworms, you can play host to a fish tapeworm that will rob you of B12 vitamins.<br>  <br>  Preventing tapeworms can be done by not consuming raw foods. The chances of getting a tapeworm through raw food consumption are very slight in industrious nations. Thoroughly cooking your meat or freezing it for a few days usually kills any tapeworms inside it. Getting rid of another source like fleas is also a way to prevent tapeworms. But if you believe that you are infected, a doctor may prescribe either niclocide or biltricide, which can treat more common tape worm species infections. <br>  <br>  Good question. Not well put, but interesting. You get a star.|`|e8Sgp92naa	In the US water is treated and filtered to prevent any harmful organisms from getting through.  So no, you're not getting any tape worms that way.  <br>  <br>  You get tape worms from eating food (or water) that contains tape worm eggs.  Cook your food thoroughly and you should be fine.|`|Qas05nZraa	tapeworms can be formed in the body by not washing your hands when eating or eating spoiled food and maybe tapwater|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Tape worms do not come from water.. They come from lack of nutrition.  And you should drink lots of water, but only to an extent.  The recommended amount of water intake daily is 6-8 8 oz. glasses... or like 6 bottles of water.  You can actually intake too much water and you're body will drown.  There have been several cases of this.. Google it.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	I don't think water causes tape worms. It is completly safe to drink lots of water. They recommend 8 cups a day! At least in the US its safe not sure about other countries.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	You can't get tapeworms from water. Read here about them...<br>  <a href="http://www.dr-dan.com/tapeworm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dr-dan.com/tapeworm.htm</a><br>  <br>  However, you CAN get giagardia cysts and other parasites, depending on where you are and what the water source is. <br>  <br>  If the tap water is coming from a dug well, its probably contaminated by bacteria such as E. coli and possibliy giagardia if there is runoff. <br>  <br>  Dug wells are generally not deep enough to be considered safe. Drilled wells are safer, but even these should be tested each spring and in heavy rainfall periods and when first drilled. <br>  <br>  If you are in a third world country you can easily get things like liverflukes and other parasites, by drinking from outdoor water sources such as streams, rivers and lakes, and even contaminated wells. <br>  <br>  Tap water may or may not be safe, when in doubt boil it. How long you need to boil it depends on how far above sea level you are. The American Red Cross website says 3 to 5 minutes, but if you plan to travel to an area where the water will be questionable, find out what the elevation will be and look up the recommended boiling time online. Higher elevations require longer boiling because water boils at a lower temperature, and must be boiled longer to actually come up to the temperature required to kill harmful organisms. <br>  <br>  There are tablets you can buy to help purify water when traveling. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nyredcross.org/page.php/prmID/208" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyredcross.org/page.php/prmID...</a><br>  ===<br>  <br>  It is not safe to drink too much water. It upsets the electrolyte balance in your blood, and can cause heart arrhythmia and even heart attacks. <br>  <br>  About 6 to 8 glasses is generally safe for most adults, but if you have problems with sodium, potassium or magnesium, its best to ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  In general, drinking when you are thirsty, and sticking with plain water is best. <br>  <br>  Extreme thirst can be a sign of ingesting too much sodium, dehydration or undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes.
PNCKh9yMaa	there not actaully worms , its worm shaped bacteria
wa3AvezGaa	Sounds like too much time on the computer and not enough experiencing life.  Go for a walk or call a friend to get together or anything outside your house, it will make you feel ALIVE!|`|B2jIiOwnaa	Yeah, but then again I suspect I have Excessive Daytime Sleepiness, a form of very mild narcolepsy.  Often, I feel really heavy and my eyes ache from sleepiness.  I just want to pull a blanket over my head and daydream until I fall asleep, even though I'm not depressed or anything.<br>  <br>  I find the best cure is having something to work at.  Something that has to be done.  Or having some other reason to stay on my feet.  Because as soon as I get bored/understimulated and sit down, I'm out like a light.<br>  <br>  The next time you get in that mode, fight the urge to stare at the monitor.  Promise yourself 10 minutes on your feet.  Run the vacuum sweeper, floss and brush your teeth--do anything! <br>  <br>  I often wake up in the wee morning hours, too.  Reading usually makes me pass out after a short time.  And if not, at least I've educated myself on something....|`|PcPswmv5aa	I get it too much.  It has been coming because I am depressed in my situation a bit and I have nothing to spark me right now.  We need to find that spark to get us juiced for our present life.

3UFvLDc7aa	there is something else wrong here.  did you lose you job so that you can't afford to eat better food?  are people worthless if they can't eat what everyone else eats?  to die of despair is just as horrible as dying of depression or starvation.|`|pRF5LLloaa	There is no guarantees that way.<br>  <br>  What kills you is the constantly high blood sugars over many years.  Eventually, after being diabetic for 20-30 years, your internal organs give out and you die VERY painfully.<br>  <br>  Most people quickly recover from high blood sugar.  The problem is that if they have a stroke while they are in a "sugar coma", they may recover from the coma to find that they are paralyzed or otherwise invalid.  This usually means that they spend the next 20-30 years of their life in a nursing home.|`|IFVrLCNOaa	to get into a diabetic shock, it would require significant spiking of blood sugar. say a # of 400. i can take some rapid ingestion of sugar and carbs to get high enough to go into a coma.  also, please note that people who ingest pills like aspirin or sleeping pills like nembutal at an overdose level often vomit part of their stomach contents requiring additional pills. i don't recommend anyone killing themselves and especially in this manner. many people are unsuccessful but suffer permanent and debilitating damage as opposed to death.|`|ygccpU2paa	Suicide is the cruelest thing you can inflict on your loved ones.

Kind of like people saying "I'm not crazy" when they are diagnosed with MPD or something.<br>  <br>  I am the victim of high blood sugar. I am only 21 years old and I have neuropathy in my legs, feet, toes, fingers, hands, arms and lips. My blood sugar tends to run very high and its very scary. It's a painful death, first of all, and the pain I am in now, just from having neuropathy, puts me in tears every night. I can't go out, I can't party, I can't have kids, I can't do much of anything.<br>  <br>  You do need help, I would encourage you to see some kind of doctor. It's a hard and painful death because your body will do whatever it possibly can to stay alive. Taking insulin or allowing your sugar to skyrocket can cause coma more often than death. And most likely in a very VERY large amount of pain.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't wish anyone this pain that I am suffering. I am depressed because of it, I am taking anti anxieties, and I am living day by day thankful to God that I am still walking on this earth.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do the same thing.|`|R3yUkaCSaa	dont kill yourself. but if uwould do it a easy way being high for to long is a slow and panfull death.
S7GqsRWDaa	Well, thats how you have to gain weight, you eat, theres no other way around it.  You probably thought you were eating a lot but in reality you probably weren't eating enough as you should have to be gaining weight.  <br>  <br>  There are weight gainers that have a ton of calories, try that.  Eat every 2-3 hours.  Wake up in the middle of the night and eat something or drink a protein shake, your body burns energy while sleeping, so if you do that it helps.<br>  <br>  I have a fast metabolism too, theres no pills or anything that will make you gain weight, you have to eat more, simply as that.  If you've tried that and nothing happened you should seriously see a doctor, maybe something is wrong.|`|8xPWd35maa	You must have an incredibly fast metabolism.   If it's really a problem, then maybe you should ask a doctor if there is some way to slow your metabolism.   Sometimes thyroid problems are the cause of weight problems.  If you're worried, you may want to consider asking some questions about that.
xYTagSIyaa	No.  Sugar cravings can not cause sinus congestion.  Doctors have said that sugar can decrease ones immune system and this, if they are right could lead to catching colds and the flu more often and that could cause sinus congestion.  <br>  <br>  If you have a sinus infection and go to the doctor, he/she may order you a cortisone nasal spray or a course of treatment with cortisone, which could increase your sugar cravings.|`|696vFx8Xaa	have never heard of such relation in any of standard textbook of ENT.

a63691a3830b4e5fe5f5f1ea966ffbc6aa	It can be true, some of it may be water weight and such. Makes sure you weight youself at the same time everyday.|`|FEAeTMnfaa	You didn't lose 10 lbs of fat.  You might have lost a lot of water weight, though.  It happens.  Ever watch the Biggest Loser?  They lose way more than that in a week.|`|ppTbSXxOaa	Definitely, everyone loses weight at different rates.|`|45719b3d3ad274a0fde7f2081625f937aa	If you say so.|`|IHHOHsMbaa	On the 16th did you weigh yourself first thing in the morning (before you ate anything?) How about today? While salads, fruits, and veggies are good, remember that you need meat in your diet as well. This is pretty believable. My first week of Weight Watchers I lost 6 pounds without exercise, however after the first week or so weight loss starts to slow to a pound or so (without exercise.) If you hit a plateau and you don't lose for a week or 2 then get off the diet for a few days and then get back on it and you should start losing again.|`|rJPBF33taa	It is believable- effort leads to redults.<br>  Keep up the good work!

Most women eventually grow a moustache of some sort, at least in their old age. Many have a moustache from their teenage years.Some shave every day from the time they're teenagers.<br>  <br>  Facial (and also body) hair on women comes about in the same way as on men because of<br>  <br>  1) your body being sensitized, before you were even born, to testosterone -- doesn't happen to all girls, but does to many<br>  <br>  2) your body producing high levels of testosterone<br>  <br>  The growth rate and coarseness of the hair depends on just how much testosterone is circulating in your bloodstream.|`|fXj2kVpPaa	When I was young I had the same thing.  I think it has to do with hormones.  I got electrolysis and it helped kill the hair roots.  <br>  <br>  It is not weird.|`|jButcWbdaa	Plenty of women wax their upper lip.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Nope.|`|hEq4R96Uaa	i wouldn't say weird, might be a bit unusual, could mean that you have a bit more testosterone than most girls. but it's not like you're growing a beard or something. has long as you wax it there is no problem.|`|upoH8NP4aa	OMG!

But yeah wax your mustache no guys like that.|`|XIzYgpYsaa	No not at all!  Sometimes things like that just happen.
gFq4QwYuaa	That white covering is the mouth equivalent of a scab, and is perfectly normal. You should not pull the white stuff away, it will open the wound to infection, cause bleeding, and make it take longer to heal.|`|7BG6eM7zaa	It sounds like you have an infection in the spot where the tooth was pulled. It would be smart to return to your dentist to have it looked at. Until you can see the dentist, you can use peroxide to ease the discomfort.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	It sounds like you have an infection.
hHSsMyNpaa	Yes be careful that you don't sit still for too long and blood will stop flowing in your legs and butt and could clot up.  Its not a bad idea to wear some firm supporting tights if you know you are going to be sitting for a long time, like on an airplane.  Or a theater.  Try it, it might make a difference.  And it doesn't hurt to shift around in your seat once in a while.  I can't sit still for a minute.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	stiffness    heaps of people feel that way|`|MUslfE1Xaa	something sticking out of the seat? :3
vATSp61Faa	I bet my house that you would not stick to this. Cardio 5 times per week max and give yourself one rest day where you do no exercise. No offence but beginners often make excessive action plans then fail miserably through poor planning, don't do the same.|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	sounds like overkill but it would depend on what you want.<br>  <br>  if you're looking just to lose weight; only work out 3 times a week for an hour per session (most via weight lifting) and get on a high fibre, low fat, meaty diet<br>  <br>  if you're looking to become a pro athlete, then it definitely looks rigourous enough<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|AFkjkqcSaa	If u are looking to loose weight quickly then yes, but you will exhaust yourself.  Remember you rest days these are vital in the repair of muscles and to help see results.  Also protein is essential, whether it be in your diet or a protein shake.|`|xv5LSNe7aa	It is NOT a BAD cardio workout i will put it that way. However you should probably take about 3 days rest a week give or take a day. and try to do more cardio in the morning, when you wake up, and do your night time excerise after you eat dinner. You need time for your body to recover otherwise you will put tremendous strain on your muscles. Weight training is good but do the cardio before the weight training, for example do the cardio when your wake up and do the weightlifting about half hour after you eat dinner, hope this helps. You also might want to check out nowloss, it has a great early excerise plan and a lot of great tips GL man. Also do not stop doing cardio for atleast a month and a half to burn a very good ammount of body fat off your body in three weeks you will only burn so many calories. Again good luck|`|WT5jdIkxaa	Nope, your doing way too much and not giving yourself time to rest. you are also starting with way too much. plus you need to have a more dynamic workout, include a lot more things to it, not just cardio and weights, you wont get anywhere
zzaScg0haa	Your muscles are hiding under fat, try doing some cardio
EDjKCt0baa	You could have mononucleosis. You have all of the symptoms. Are the lymph nodes on your neck swollen? Feel the sides of your neck and see if you have raised "knots". If you do, the most likely thing is Mononucleosis (kissing disease). The only thing you could do for this is to wait for it to run its course while treating the symptoms.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor- they'll probably run an EB(Epstein-Barr) test on your blood.|`|4a193039d2091ca991c160a69962775baa	Sounds like Strep Throat to me|`|d2TRqOEuaa	a cold|`|qlDV1OZwaa	cancer

Eat fruits and veggies next to regular but small portioned meals for about 2 days and those 4 lbs will go down.|`|qy07K2k5aa	You didn't eat too much at all.|`|j6PrOaZgaa	cuz u must have lost weight too quickly so you will gain it just as fast.<br>  just continue to eat healthy and use portions and exersize and the weight will STAY off. <br>  but any fast cure for weightloss wont work because it wont last.|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	A fluctuation in hydration levels could be the cause.|`|2kg2cOHOaa	you ate a lot of chips. maybe that's what caused you to gain weight.|`|zMDkllJvaa	the weight could be in extra food in your body or colen or water
xsyAljhaaa	It's best to weigh yourself in the morning after you relieve yourself if you want to be as light as you can, and the converse if you are trying to bulk up and like to see big numbers. You tend to gain around 5 lbs. during the day from eating and when you get up and empty out you are at your lightest. You shouldn't weigh yourself everyday, because your weight tends to fluctuate depending on what you've eaten, if you are retaining water, (more of a problem for women though), the last time you've eaten, taking a leak, etc. If you are dieting you should weigh yourself in the morning for consistency's sake, and you should only weigh yourself once a week. [I don't take my own advice though, when I'm training hard I weigh myself a few times a day, LoL.]|`|AQzAvW70aa	The key for losing weight is simple - consume less food and move more often - the problems surface when we actually try to put that into practice! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the real world aren't there?! The sole thing which definitely delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost 30 pounds, it definitely does produce results!

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	I wouldn't go so far as to say their is "damage" unless you have a focal motor deficit such as a foot drop, but your pain is suggestive of something with a neurological bias.  <br>  <br>  I'd suggest seeing a physical therapist who is certified in mechanical diagnosis and therapy.  Go to www.mckenziemdt.org<br>  <br>  You might be able to get started on your own by reading the "treat your own back" book by Robin McKenzie, but if you are having trouble standing and walking, you might still need clinician assistance to guide you through which exercises are the most appropriate for you.  <br>  <br>  The good news is: the vast majority of these problems do go away on their own.  If your pain persists beyond 4 weeks or is getting worse, it's definetely pertinent to seek care.

z5JkgFOyaa	I once experienced prolonged breakthrough bleeding on the pill that lasted 5 & 1/2 weeks due to the estrogen in my birth control pill being too low causing a hormone imbalance.<br>  <br>  Missing of birth control pills every couple of days is the most common cause of continuous bleeding which is due to low estrogens which make the endometrium atrophic (using this as an example only).<br>  <br>  A small amount of estrogen is needed to make the lining of the uterus repair the open blood vessels that result from a menstrual slough. After a menses, estrogen alone in a normally ovulating woman not taking birth control starts the tissue growing again and in effect seals off the bleeding blood vessels. This makes bleeding stop. <br>  <br>  With birth control pills that have both estrogen (very small doses) and progestin in each pill, the progestin component works opposite the estrogen and does not allow the endometrial tissue to grow and repair itself. If a woman is on a progestin only birth control pill, or using Depo Provera (for example) which is pure progestin only, the same effect takes place, ie. the endometrium may not totally repair its entire surface inside the uterus because of a lack of estrogen or the antagonism of the progestin working against any small amount of estrogen present in the woman's body. <br>  <br>  I would think that this is probably either due to you only being on the pill for a short time, or perhaps you are experiencing a hormone imbalance.  I would recommend you consult with your doctor to see what he/she says as they may need to change you to a different brand of the pill should this continue.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|EyILyzLwaa	You just need to wait for it to adjust<br>  Youre just experiencing some break thru bleeding<br>  If it continues after 2-3 months, just go back <br>  and theyll give you another bc<br>  It kinda sounds like its not the bc for you with those side effects<br>  But :] just see what happens

y0zxk79Maa	(Sorry for making this so long LOL) Girl please! Dont believe him! I advise you to save yourself for the right one. If you're not having sex, please dont start! It doesnt sound like you are ready because a guy will say whatever to get into your panties! In the end, he will get the most pleasure and he will have your virginity! Once its gone, it is gone... Remember that! And bleeding is common, but it wont be much blood (its only broken skin). Also like I said, think about it before you do it with him. He doesnt sound special to you at all. But to answer your main question, Yes its possible to have an orgasm, but even some women who have been having sex, have never had one. It all depends on him and it all depends on you.|`|A9oStYsCaa	wow. he sounds like a real top choice to give your virginity to...|`|AA10441869	First I would be wary of a man who says he is a sex king. If you pleasure yourself and know your own body it is  possible to have someone else do it to you. But be informed most women do not have an orgasm during intercourse. So don't be let down if it doesn't happen. Your first time having sex it might be tender so go slow. you may or may not bleed alittle. Just don't expect there to be bells and stars.

V7lGsaR8aa	You are not trying !|`|cE0Xat61aa	you're pathetic|`|mmEEs9mcaa	Search your medicine cabinet, usually there are some miscellaneous benzos/opiates---- look for hydrocodone, oxycodone/oxycontin. Also, look for things ending in -pin, -prine, -pam... or anything like that. <br>  <br>  You could also try some natural highs, such as meditation or breathing exercises. <br>  <br>  DO NOT do glue. All you're doing there is ******* up your brain with harmful chemicals and depriving yourself of oxygen. This includes air-duster things. Not worth it bro. <br>  <br>  The DPH (benadryl) can be sketchy. If you haven't done it before, empty stomach about 200-300mg, give or take depending on your weight. You will get very tired, so I suggest taking it while not on a comfy couch, and the drug dosages are very unpredictable, so you could trip balls, or you could just get really friggin' tired. <br>  I warn you though, it's not a drug for everyone... Your whole world go absolutely crazy, and you see really scary things that aren't there, and you accept them as reality, which can be a VERY dangerous thing. The cough medicine can enhance a DPH trip, but be careful, and check the active ingredients, and DXM should be the ONLY active ingredient for it to be safe. Always be careful with this, because people underestimate the power of a delerious drug, and they take too much, and have a mental breakdown because they can't handle how real it is. <br>  Before you do ANYTHING, check the active ingredients and then check www.erowid.org. This is a GREAT resource for most common drugs.|`|IMvg8zajaa	never take Dextromethorphan with Benadryl allergy, it's deadly.<br>  Take about 300mg of Benadryl allergy.|`|wTkvkWscaa	You could sniff some glue.<br>  <br>  <br>  hahaha|`|OEhCFfV2aa	ummm rehab?|`|dN0kcn4caa	12 benedryl, don't fall asleep.<br>  20 robitussin gel caplets = 1 bottle of robitussin = about 1 1/2 dose of DXM<br>  12 dramamine<br>  8 CCC's<br>  <br>  pretty much anything that has the active ingrdient of dextromethorphan or dyphinadramine or dyphinhydinate will get you high.<br>  be careful, your liver might fail.<br>  <br>  i shouldn't even be writing this, i just know from experience.|`|BSockNx7aa	I think you need help...<br>  like alot|`|dnrW2VTaaa	the question is <br>  y would you want to???<br>  <br>  plus u really shouldnt

xYTagSIyaa	The main pain medications are aspirin, Tylenol or ibuprofen related and sometimes they have codeine in them.  To the best of my knowledge none of these have any ingredients that can cause an increase in appetite.  The doctor may however prescribe a cortisone shot for arthritis pain and this may temporarily cause an increase in appetite.<br>  <br>  There are a lot or medicines that increase appetite,  I will start with three  that come to the top of my mind.<br>  <br>  Depressant medications have often caused an increase in appetite.<br>  <br>  Cortisone type medications often given for asthma or lupus or cancer.<br>  <br>  Some thyroid medications have been known to do this.<br>  <br>  I wish I knew the one/s you are concerned with and I could tell you about those ones.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped
InI33juraa	sweetie, if u cant handle drawing blood, dont even consider being a doctor..an obstetrician who delivers your baby also does c-sections..if u cant handle drawing blood, then u definately cant handle cutting a womans abdomen open and pulling out a fetus! choose another career honey, or give it a try and see if blood really does freak u out!

GvQHw4Ntaa	Ibuprofen will help, and I think you'd also benefit from taking evening primrose oil as a supplement around the time of your period.. it's known to help treat breast tenderness.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you might have cystic breast disease... if you feel lumps in your breasts when they're sore like this, that's the number one symptom. It's completely harmless but very painful, and is most often treated with evening primrose oil, which I mentioned above.

gklfvgTxaa	It is a psychological illness. Anorexia Nervosa is a well known eating disorder that leads to the sufferer eating too little due to self-imposed starvation. It is a potentially life-threatening illness that requires immediate medical attention.<br>  <br>  A person with anorexia is extremely focused on losing weight, so much so that it becomes the main concern of their days. It usually starts with the person going on a diet to lose weight. The dieting continues and more and more foods become avoided. Skipping meals and/or refusing to eat with friends or family may start and her/his weight increasingly drops. At this point friends or family will usually notice the weight loss and will say soomething out of concern. Many will stop dieting at this point.<br>  <br>  If the dieting continues a females periods will stop once her body fat proportion falls below a critical level (although it can occur earlier, not long after the beginning of dieting), however she will not be concerned with this and continue dieting. Although the sufferer has lost a lot of weight they will continue to exercise. The sufferer will often feel guilty when she/he eats something (even if it's something small) and will feel the need to burn the calories consumed by exercising. Some sufferers will vomit to get rid of the food.<br>  <br>  If the weight loss continues, the sufferer will begin to experience physical symptoms, like dizziness, lack of energy and sensitivity to cold. She/he may still say that they are fat and try to lose more weight. Usually at this point family and friends are aware of the problem and try to persuade or even force her/him to eat. The sufferer will then begin to lie to cover up not eating. They may start to exercise in secret, take laxatives and hide food. If parents or friends force them to eat they may vomit afterwards. Food and dieting become their main preoccupation while they increasingly become socially isolated. <br>  <br>  As you can see it's a very serious disorder, which is why a person with anorexia can't stop and (as many people will tell them) just eat something. They need professional help to recover. Sorry I wrote so much but I think it's important for people to learn as much as they can about psychological disorders, that way there will be less judgmental ignorance directed towards the sufferers. Good on you for having an open mind and wanting to learn about it.|`|IGCZq7BXaa	i dont know but anorexic people look nasty|`|77NzfiVkaa	It means that you starve yourself either to lose weight or to just have control over some aspect of your life.|`|Vr5R7483aa	Anorexia Nervosa.

d12HO6vXaa	oh my. that is proberly the worst pain ever! when you wee! i had one back in september and i used to cry literrly on the toilet and put a towel in my mouth, im in not a person to complain much about pain, I didnt want to make a fuss, so i handled that pain for a week and then i decided to take cranberry tablets to reduce the pain and get rid ! Painkillers wont work! You need to get antibyotics from your dr ok, myne began on the monday, and then by the saturday it was so painful and then on the sunday i was ill, and puking up and then the following tuesday i was still in pain and puking up again, n then the wednesday night, I had extreme pain in my lower sides of my back, the UTI had infected my kidneys so I had to go to hospital to have antibyotics on a drip, so go to your dr because antibyotics is the only thing which will help, trust me x itll only get worse|`|1aJjFrUCaa	Cranberry juice, and a lot of it. Until you can see a doctor and get antibiotics for it, cranberry juice is your best friend. It lubricates the urinary tract and makes the bacteria from the infection less likely to stick. Also, the more fluid you drink, the more you have to process, so it flushes out the bacteria a bit more.|`|DSzG23WRaa	Absolutely. If your dr. doesn't give you pain pills, then you can buy over the counter stuff. AZO sells cranberry pills for a healthy urinary tract but they also sell pills you take for the pain. They turn your pee orange, and they work really well for the burning you probably are experiencing. Walmart sells them, just bought some. I am in the middle of a UTI myself. Good luck to you.|`|cfduV3xbaa	Take some Advil, also drink plenty of water to flush it out!<br>  <br>  There is a tablet you can get called Ural, you put it in a glass of water and it make it fizz... Its really good for UTI's.<br>  <br>  Hope you start feeling better, UTI's suck :o(|`|ziVtTtObaa	Over the counter pyridium acts as an analgesic for the bladder to help with the urgency and burning. An antibiotic is needed to kill the bacteria that caused the UTI. drink lots of water to flush your kidneys out. Go to your local medi center. they can fix you up and you will feel better soon.
8qmAe25jaa	NO!.  it dehydrates you. That defiantly wont help. If anything it will make you hungrier. You do realize you can die if you keep drinking it right?

7PS3fSSPaa	Well the best way since at this age your metabolism should be high is try eating right.For example : eat fruits and vegetables in between meals instead of chips and sodas. Also do light weight lifting with lots of repetition and try running any where from 30-45 min a day. Start off at your own pace then set goals. Like try to set a goal that allows you to increase the time or speed every week by a little maybe a minute till you reach 30-45 min or maybe speed. The important thing at your age is to stay active and eat the right foods. I wouldn't suggest dietary supplements at your age because they might throw off your body's own natural system. There is no good diet out there the best thing to do is to change you life style. Become more active! if your not much of a runner or do not want to try, then take up something active that you're interested in like judo, soccer, football, tennis, boxing, Ect.. i think you get what im trying to say. Its good now that your interested in taking care of yourself because as you get older it will be more difficult.|`|ReNmXYiKaa	I wanted to loose weight at that age too, so I tried out for my high school crew team, which worked out absolutely great for me.<br>  <br>  What it did was force me to do workouts, it was also good because during that time I was at practice everyday I wasn't eating junk food or anything bad.  <br>  <br>  If you are serious about this I think that you should join a team that will force you to do the work.  I tried doing somethings on my own like running, and crunches at my house I could do them for a week or two and then I stopped doing them.<br>  <br>  Also when you get home from the practice, eat healthy(or just eat smaller portions of what you do eat), because if you are pigging out you will not gain any of the benefits of the work you put in. <br>  <br>  In crew I lost about 20 lbs. in a month and a half (of course we were running almost 3-4 mi. a day) but if you eat a ton after practice you wont get anywhere.<br>  <br>  And if this does not work for you you could try joining a gym, and make your mom drop you off there everyday so you can't leave early, which will force you to do work. <br>  <br>  Most of my weight was lost by running and lowering the amount of food intake.<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped|`|u3oexKCnaa	The formula for losing those extra pounds is easy - consume less food and exercise more often - the difficulties appear when we really try to put that into operation!

Start listening to music you enjoy, go for a walk, call a friend, try and think positive thoughts.

vTra7n5baa	I am not psychiatrist, but you do not sound like a crazy person to me.  Think of it for a minute.  Look at all the violent images we see on TV and in film.  Violence has become a normal pattern of imagery for us on many levels.  We have become desensitized to it in a way.  But this image of a man in a chicken suit holds the irony of a man in a clown suit:  it's supposed to be funny, but scares us psychologically.  I think you have associated many images of what is acceptable and what is not not based on your tolerance level for it.  So, because of increased exposure to violence on TV, this might be why you find the chicken man more disturbing.|`|t2x7Cr6Gaa	Hi there, what your are experiencing is something we  all experience in our life and that is fear.

He will probably hit his growth spurt in a year or two and lose weight at that point.<br>  <br>  At any rate, in general, you cannot control other people.  If your parents are concerned about his weight, that is their problem.  Worry about yourself and let your parents worry about your little brother.|`|cBspfn7xaa	eat better|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	You need to have your parents take him to a pediatrician for a healthy diet.

8SRjELNBaa	Your parents SHOULD be supportive and respect the fact you want to lose weight.<br>  <br>  However, i'm not in your shoes.<br>  <br>  What you want to do is DRINK LOTS of water (very common, non-suspicious thing to do).  Drink two glasses of water before a meal & one with a meal.<br>  <br>  Watch your carbohydrate for beakfast, lunch & dinner.<br>  <br>  Avoid the unhealthy snackies.  Eat healthy one's instead like fruits & vegetables.<br>  <br>  My middle school had a state-of-the-art gym & if yours does, ask your p.e. teacher what the hours are for open use.  Use it after school.|`|iiExfNYQaa	eat regular food ,only smaller portions|`|xoveRPysaa	Im 15, and Im the biggest Ive ever been.

6jSxYrZnaa	Good nutrition. Lean meat and vegetables. Vegetables and lean meat. And some eggs, and some nuts, and some fruit. And then more vegetables and lean meat. Eat as much as you want. You cannot possibly "overeat" on this food. And undereating slows down your metabolism making you less efficient at losing bodyfat. So there's no need to be hungry.<br>  <br>  This is the correct answer. It's mostly about what you eat. You can supplement with exercise like hiit if you want (crunches will do nothing), but without getting your nutrition dialled in nothing will happen. Like it or not.|`|GiYVrmI3aa	Do crunches and sit ups to tone it. I have the same problem.|`|vjEbUVxhaa	as for the answer above, i dont know if that gets rid of it.  i think that means you're toned without the fat...<br>  <br>  sorry i cant answer your question, but i do know theres a difference between losing the fat and toning yourself, and thats what the crunches will do.|`|J9Hw9js8aa	Your diet is 100% responsible for the bottom of your stomach.  Try this: Eat 4-5 smaller meals a day and drink PLENTY of water.  Stay active and make sure you consume your vegetables. Best of Luck to ya
rhHgrohdaa	I dont think the problem is with you. I think the problem is because your Fiancee feel insecure about her body.

But then we went thru the same thing when our boys were younger.  I was always so busy with them that I didn't have time for him.  <br>  Stress and fatigue, and weight gain have alot to do with a persons sex drive disappearing.  <br>  Maybe you need to go away for the weekend.  Get a nice room at a motel - something out of the ordinary - get a room with a hottub.  Spend some alone time discovering each other again.
FEAeTMnfaa	Discharge is fairly normal when you are just starting your period.  However, if you are itchy or the discharge is thick & white or greenish or has a foul odor, you should go see a gynecologist because you could have an infection.  Yeast infections are not uncommon and nothing to be embarrassed about, but you should have a doctor diagnose them.  <br>  <br>  If you have never had a regular period yet, it is possible that your body is still adjusting to the new hormones.  You should talk to your mom or another female relative you trust about this (or maybe your school nurse).|`|Plu6OVoGaa	It's normal to be.

First of all, if at all possible, join one of the sport teams at your school. Do not care what people think (I joined the wrestling team at 192 lbs. all fat) A school sport is one of the greatest boosts a guy can get in order to start a healtheir life. I am no longer wresting and am 138 lbs. If you really dont want to join a team, then simply start running as long as you can (even if that is 5 minutes) You will soon be able to run for longer. After a few months of pure aerobics add some resistance training. WARNING! This does not mean lift weights! You are waaaaaayyyy too young to lift weights. Only use light resistance with aerobic exercises for now.<br>  Also, I do not care what anyone says. If you want to lose wieght the right way, DO NOT cut good carbs, or good fat from your diet. This does not mean eat twinkies and Burger King. I am talking about complex carbs found in grains, fruits and veggies that release slowly so your body is not shocked into storing them as fat. Also, if you do not give your body the essential fat that it needs, it will eat at your MUSCLE first. <br>  Best of Luck to You!|`|a8RdiGkUaa	get involved in sports or any outdoor activity, walking is also a good way to loose a few pounds.

WlZ66KnZaa	It really depends if you do exercise. If you do exercise pasta is actually one of the best things to have since it is filling and burns fast when working out. On the other hand, if you arent exercising pasta can be really fattening. Pasta is fine in moderation, like 300 or 400 cal of it for breakfast.|`|uh3cNjzxaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the sole diet which definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today.

78hPa4haaa	It depends on the person.<br>  A regular person probably couldn't do that very healthy. But like I said it just depends on who you are. <br>  If you are going to do that then you really have to be strict with it. You need to have a really strict diet and exercise routine. <br>  If you need any more help just email me.<br>  And don't listen to the both of answerers under me. They are sales men. They triy to sell that product. Look at their answers, they are all about that product and say pretty much the same thing as their answer to your question. There is no magic pill that can make you lose weight. You have to do it on your own and work hard for what you want.

4e32757c6602dc28699abde7b9ffb05baa	Cardio exercise is the only thing that really burns fat. If you have video games at home, try Wii Fit, Dance, Dance Revolution, etc to get your heart rate up and really start sweating. If you don't like to run, you can walk fast- its hard for me too because I have short legs. Whatever you do, make sure that your parents or an adult is aware of your new workout routine. Because you're not fully grown, it can be risky to start a new fitness program without consulting a doctor or your parents. You could also ask your school guidance counselor, gym teacher, or a coach.
8UnGBdyVaa	Even though you might not like the answer, its lifestyle change and exercising.<br>  <br>  I manage eating 6 small meals everyday, for a total of 1200 calories.

6jSxYrZnaa	"how can i continue to eat basically nothing, but keep my metabolism running fast and not gain weight back."<br>  <br>  You can't - that's the point. The only way to build and maintain a good metabolic rate is to eat healthily. It is just counter-productive to undereat. If your diet is based on lean meat and vegetables you will lose bodyfat. And you can eat as much of this as you want. Throw in some eggs, fruit and nuts as well. Be consistent and see what happens.|`|WlZ66KnZaa	Exercise and adding muscle helps alot. You will lose more weight if you eat and exercise since not eating and excerising can just take away muscle and not fat.

Also deit pills do that but if you stop them they add fat fast.|`|aCDWwsisaa	The reason "starvation diets arent the best" is because they CANNOT POSSIBLY WORK.

In order to correctly use a hooka, you must put tobacco in the bowl. Don't be fooled that because it's tasty that it doesn't contain any harmful effects. Additionally, because it does have a filter system to smoke, it does NOT prevent you from health hazards. <br>  CDC.gov explains that the effects are still the same as regular smoking.<br>  The only thing that hooka tobacco does not have in comparison to cigarettes is the tar. <br>  <br>  P.S. Shisha76, shisha=coals. Shisha is not the correct term for the actual hooka itself. Learn this before commenting and bashing people when you have no factual evidence.
P5CyGvZuaa	I hate to say it, but nothing works besides old fashioned exercise and eating right.<br>  <br>  Eat 5 small meals a day, be conscious of food labels.  Don't eat a lot of processed foods.  Replace chips or pretzels or any other snacky foods with fruit and vegetables and yogurt.  SKIP the soda.  Eat breakfast.  Fill your plate with foods that contain fiber.  It makes you feel full longer and cleans out your system.<br>  <br>  Exercise everyday, even if it's just for a little.  Do cardio workouts like running, jogging, or biking.  Supplement that with toning exercises like crunches, push-ups, and weight training.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, be safe.  Good luck.|`|TzGSbapYaa	Jump roping is really really good, it works every part of your body, and it burns a lot of fat. Did you know, that 10 minutes of jump roping=30 minutes of jogging?

FEAeTMnfaa	When my throat hurts, some ibuprofen (Advil) and Chloraseptic usually do the trick to make it feel better.  Also, tea with some lemon and honey is very soothing on a sore throat.<br>  <br>  If I think I am coming down with something, I like to take Halls Defense, or some other lozenges or vitamins with Vitamin C and Echinacea.  <br>  <br>  The absolute best way to help your immune system fight things off, however, is lots of rest and fluids.  Make sure you get enough sleep until you are sure you feel better.|`|FqgCZvvPaa	drink some tea and put some honey in the tea, it wont cure the sore throat but it will help it not be as sore if it doesn't stop the soreness all together.|`|leD79ZAyaa	refrigerated goose fat (ew hella gross i know but it works!) or...burn sugar and suck on the harded pieces.

The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.<br>  <br>  Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.<br>  <br>  First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.<br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|fyoudpsgaa	I lost like five pounds in a week by switching to regular meals and only water, no soda or other drinks, but you should maybe bike, jogging, remember to exercise before meals so that your metabolism is faster, and you'll lose the weight easy :D|`|CP3IiHG3aa	You just need to exercise like run, jog, swim... and you need to eat right.

pUIGCtaZaa	Most likely, she did break her hymen, especially if it was her first time having intercourse. Tell her not to worry, though. Bleeding after first-time intercourse is very common and is not anything to be panicked about. However, if the bleeding persists she needs to make an appointment with her doctor because another problem may exist. I hope this helps.|`|XxUIOZdIaa	she probably did break her hymen and if i were her i would talk to him
AA10766729	You'll be fine.  Shortening the length of your period week is ok to do; just never extend it (past the 7 days that is).<br>  <br>  Just don't mess with your cycle too often, or you risk messing things up and being miserable (and possibly not protected).

I know guys who masturbate 2-3 times a day. Masturbation gets rid of old sperm and prevents prostate cancer. It also maintains an overall good health of the libido. There are no side effects unless you masturbate like 10 times a day.

Keep it up and you'll get the look you want. <br>  Hope This Helps|`|IHHOHsMbaa	I doubt that it is muscle you are gaining so quickly. By eating healthier, what do you mean? Salad is healthy, but if you eat 6 servings of it than you are obviously going to gain weight.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	The first question is your dress size getting smaller?  The second question is are you doing low intensity or high intensity workouts?<br>  <br>  Work out smarter, not harder. Low intensity workouts (elliptical, running, biking) where your heart rate stays in Zone 2 (60-70% of maximum heart rate) burns calories at a rate 85% calories, 15% glycogen. The higher your heart rate or the more intense the workout the lower the ratio of Fat to Glycogen becomes.<br>  <br>  If you run 3 miles in 23 minutes and your heart is pounding at the end, you've burned about 480 calories of which probably 400 cal. came from sugar.  You build muscle here and increase lung and heart capacity.<br>  <br>  If you WALK 3 miles in 45 minutes, and you feel like you could walk another 3 miles no problem, then chances are you burned 400 cal. that came from fat stores (which is harder for your body to replace) and 80 cal came from sugar. (The number of calories burned is essentially the same in either case because you do the same amount of work -- the laws of physics are hard to change.)<br>  <br>  Check to make sure you're eating just as much now as you did before.  Often athetes need to consume an extra 1000 - 1500 cals a day just to maintain weight.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	"ive been eating better"<br>  <br>  How do you know? What is the glycemic index of the carbohydrates you're eating? How much monounsaturated fat are you eating? I'm not being a funny bugger, I'm just trying to make two points. (1) Nutrition is more important for losing bodyfat than exercise. By far. (2) It's a complicated business and most dietary advice will lead you to store more bodyfat as amazing as that is.<br>  <br>  However, it need not be complicated. Eat as much lean meat and leafy vegetables as you want. Seriously, as much as you want. Throw in some eggs, fruit and unsalted nuts. If you only eat these foods (in good amounts) you will lose bodyfat. I guarantee it.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	a) What are you eating?  You can't eat junk and expect exercise to make up for it.  If you really want to lose weight, you need to both diet AND exercise; eat less, and make healthier choices in what you eat (cut back on sugars and fats, eat more veggies and whole grains, etc).<br>  <br>  b) How are you exercising?  For weight loss, you want to focus on aerobic exercise; fast walking, jogging, swimming, bike riding, etc.; generally at least 20 minutes a day, and if you can make it 30 or more, even better.  Some people do 5 minutes of situps and wonder why they don't lose weight.|`|vVZLY82Iaa	it is the muscle that is giving you more Weight. If you are eating right and exercising enough and properly then it should just be muscle. eventually you will just start losing weight unless you start increasing the workout a good amount.|`|gJNxfoJHaa	if you are working out then its MUSCLES not fat :)|`|ZSqOK0KMaa	Your stressing yourself in achieving your desired weight and instead of loosing it your gaining it because your conscious about it.

But if you are doing the appropriate exercises for weight loss, you should not be gaining muscle. Stick to cardio (running, walking, jumping jacks etc.)|`|CHe30rdiaa	yeah, it's just muscle, no need to worry|`|X453cUVFaa	i work out 5 days a wk religiously and this happens ur gaining muscle|`|uMnlVZ8oaa	You are correct that muscle weighs more than fat. Also, are you drinking more water than you did before you started exercising? If you are your body is just holding water and will naturally get rid of it. An important aspect of your exercise and healthy eating routine that you should include on your post is what kinds of exercises you are doing and what types of food, because if you are just substituting regular food for low fat or fat free foods but are still eating the same amount that will result in weight gain. Some of these types of food like cookies or other junk food may be lower in fat but they are usually much higher in sugar and sodium (salt) than regular fat foods which put weight on very quickly. Pay attention to food labels, look at salt, sugar, and fat content along with how many servings there are in whatever food you are eating. You should increase cardio, such as running, swimming, biking, etc. to increase caloric burn. Also, drinking tea (especially green tea) and eating whole grains have been proven to help boost metabolism and make you feel fuller longer, so you don't eat as much throughout the day. Another thing that I find helpful is to use light weights (3lb weights) while doing squats or lunges, which helps to build lean feminine muscle and helps your body to metabolize fat faster. One last thing, although you have gained weight, you shouldn't get too upset because you most likely have lost inches. I hope this helps you, don't get discouraged.
hwZMijykaa	You can't buy the berries themselves. But you can buy the juice or pills at most health foods stores (Native Sun, Fresh Market, GNC, etc) I buy the Acai Berry juice at GNC. They have a variety of brands for you to try.<br>  <br>  I've provided a few links so you can see what the bottle looks like so if you do decide to try this brand, you'll know what you're looking for. I've tried a lot of superfoods supplements/juices and found Garden Greens the best as far as flavor and price goes.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Women that are especially thin are more prone to this issue.  My Grandma told me a story about how she met my Grandpa when she was 18, and he was in the Air Force in the Korean War so she didn't see him for a year but he proposed in a letter to her.  She wanted to marry him but was afraid because she never had her period and he would write about having lots of babies, etc. and she was afraid she couldn't have them.  So finally she went to an OBGYN to find out why she never had her period and they gave her a hormone shot which started her period.  My Grandpa came home a year later when she was 19 (a year after her period) and right away she got pregnant and had her first baby before age 20.  She went on to have 7 children total.  Soooooo my point is, go to a doctor and find out the reasoning.  Some women just need Birth control pills to get things going.  Could be really simple.  Or there could be a problem which can be fixed. Don't jump to conclusions.   As far as your situation, lots of women have irregular cycles, that doesn't mean anything.|`|7ach0Dz5aa	go to the doctor..not everyone has regular monthly periods, i never used to and my doc said it was normal. Also i was able to have a baby...but get that checked|`|3BB8EtdNaa	weeeeeeeeeeeeell 20 is extremely late for the first period...Im not sure if thats true, but if a girl/ woman past menopause doesnt get her period, it usually means she cannot conceive a baby.|`|AA11705584	no irregular periods are common especially when your young. To be safe just go to a gyno|`|lHIMSICbaa	If you are getting a monthly period and are otherwise healthy, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't be able to have children. You get a period when your egg is unfertilized aka no sperm and thus must be expelled from the body. If you are really worried you could always go see a doctor. I've heard of women getting their first period later than most adolescents but 20 years old I'm not sure if that's normal. Sorry I hope that this helped alittle.|`|HtPX4uEMaa	That's a tough one. Generally, girls can get a period as late as 17. Twenty though -wince- She should go to a gynie to have it checked up. Chances are your initial fear is right though.<br>  <br>  As for your irregularity.It's natural in a girl. My sister went three months without a period and then it suddenly came. She's fine.<br>  <br>  Also, it could have to do with physical activity. If her body is overly stressed, she won't get a period. Ex: Gymnists. They work out a lot, are on strict diets, and their bodies don't develope how they should. They don't get periods (mind you I don't mean ALL gymnists, but a lot of younger ones are like this).|`|yn3KCJtPaa	i get my period every 3 months too!!! but my mom said if i had sex i would get pregnat. i havent had sex so i dont know if i would get pregnat, but irregular periods are normal

XhvnobVSaa	It is a possibility to lose weight fast but you should be realistic and take on board that if you lose weight rapidly then you will probably put it all back on again just as rapidly. The only method that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials left, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

wF3YmF4Naa	I know you're scared right now. I remember when I had a scare. I was a nervous wreck for days. They say that some of the newer types of pregnancy test can give you an accurate answer within 8 days of conception. However, everyone is different. It has been a few more days, so go and get another test. You can try as often as you want. They say the best time to test yourself is the first time you go to the bathroom in the morning. <br>  Just try again. I hope you get the answer you're looking for.

MNqs6B6saa	Strength training is a great way to build up a bit of muscle which will help your body burn more fat, helping you to lose fat. Interval training on a treadmill or elliptical (or a sidewalk) 5 days a week would benefit you as well.|`|aDxaEvx8aa	probably daily stretching and cardio fitness exercises.<br>  (and yes, swimming and walking do help to lose weight, it just has to be at least a 20 minute session)|`|sG80JKvtaa	The best form of exercise for losing weight is to mix it up with aerobics and strength training.  Aerobics will give you the higher calorie and fat burning benefits while strength training help builds lean muscle.  The more lean muscle the higher your metabolism is so that you can keep the weight off.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for some example exercises to mix it up (like circuit training, interval training, strength training), check out the link below for some sample exercise routines.  This site has lots of useful information plus free online calculators including an exercise calculator.

Wash your skin daily. and If they touched they will come back because your just adding more dirt. <br>  <br>  Stop itching them and it will take time for them to go away. Be patient. Buy products and stay only with one product that is not strong. I do not reccomend oxy at all. Get neutrogena. Good luck

I used to be 2IC at Bras N things and i would highly reccommend you visit one of there stores for a proper fitting. It is there job to find the right style and size to suit your body shape. But honestly the berlei or my favourate the Milano are really really comfortable. Then again if you dont like the feel of a bra all together you could try the Intimate Secret range at you guessed it Bras N things they are seem free stitch free and label free and it feels like your wearing nothing at all. hope this helps xx|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Try a full coverage bra.  I think JC Penny's has them, but they may be for larger breasted women.

Then search the internet for stores that carry that brand.|`|X453cUVFaa	yeah u want a full coverage bra like an 18 hr or something|`|jVi1uJ8Laa	kohls|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Try wearing a cup size bigger first.

wGTisY1aaa	email me if you need any more.good luck.<br>  <br>  My workout routine<br>  I do a push pull workout on most days. 3 days a week i do strength training and the other 3 I do  65 minutes cardio moderate speed (3.5- 3.7)for walking on an incline of 1-2. For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.<br>  <br>  Monday- biceps triceps and shoulders/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Tuesday – cardio 1hr and 15 min/abs<br>  Wednesday - chest back and abs/ cardio for 65 minutes<br>  Thursday cardio 1 hour and 15 minutes<br>  Friday- legs/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Saturday- cardio hour and 15 minutes/ abs<br>  Sunday- off<br>  This routine has helped me lose 70 lbs of fat and 16 inches off my entire body and gain 45 lbs of muscle after having a baby. I was 180 in March of this year and now I am 140 lean and solid at 5'1"(do not look it though).

rzBxRw7Haa	Hi, you should go to your doctors and get this checked out especially as you actually passed out and you have had this feeling many times before.<br>  Get an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible and if you remember take a urine sample with you that way he can check for sugar and infections of you bladder. (many infections can cause dizziness)<br>  Your symptoms can be as a result of many things but for someone your age it is more likely to be something simple like a virus, low blood sugar (hypoglycemic) or Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when sitting or standing up quickly).<br>  You say you have this all the time but do you mean it is there all the time just recently or has it been going on for a long time? <br>  Do you eat regularly or do you snack and miss meals as this could cause low blood sugar.<br>  Make sure to tell your doctor everything you can think of since these feelings of dizziness first started.<br>  Good luck|`|ewV1gSQnaa	There are a lot of reasons for this. The most likely is low blood pressure.<br>  This is some thing you MUST talk to a doctor about. It could also be MVP. Mytral Valve Prolaps.This is a defect in the Mytral valve (bycuspid) valve. It is managed well with meds. I have the MVP. You should see a doctor ASAP. <br>  You could check out www.webmd.com|`|LzzTpVEUaa	Ugh, I get that feeling all the time. I went to the nurse one day at school, and she said it could be low blood sugar or anemia (low iron).|`|OgkGsCkvaa	I wouldn't stress it too much.  Yeah, if it's been going on for a while, go to the doctor and get checked.... usually it's something as simple where medication or diet can get it taken care of.|`|73458eadba0f98a5aadf5ddb0b5dc1ceaa	Maybe not a blood test but a blood PRESSURE test. My friend has the same problem because she has low blood pressure. Get it checked out.|`|XzksDeE3aa	OMG the same thing happened to me! I was at school though, far more embarrasing.  I went to the doctor and he said it wasn't anything to worry about because all the tests I got were fine. But if it happens agian, you should go get checked out.|`|tM35loy4aa	I think you go see your doctor and tell them what you felt and ask some medical pill. I believe you must of eat something that you might be allergic. I say you should keep something or get something that makes you stay awake.|`|6ah8cUsAaa	Maybe not a blood test, wouldn't stress it too much.|`|T0pkW783aa	I think you should call the doctor's office and explain what happened.  If he feels as if you should be seen immediately, he will tell you.  It is hard to diagnose this type of problem without having all the facts and the person who should be doing it is a doctor.  You could just have low blood sugar and that can make you pass out:  hypoglycemia  Look it up and see if the symptoms match yours. I have a relative who has it and it makes him dizzy sometimes and he gets very hungry and shaky if he doesn't have something immediately when he gets the symptoms.  You will feel much better when you get to the bottom of this problem.  Call ASAP so you will not worry.  Good luck.

You can get more active with it and still have fun. <br>  Tummy and thighs are my problem areas too. There are always crunches and squats... they hurt like hell but give you a great workout!|`|Df3gXIykaa	always cardio, exercises like squats, leg presses, calf raises, and ab workouts will do the trick|`|6ah8cUsAaa	you can do exercises like squats, leg presses, calf raises,maybe will help you|`|rmsDrHWjaa	Targetted weight loss is quite tough, some would say impossible, however the sole diet that clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I lost thrity pounds, it clearly does produce results!
FicyC2TXaa	No. Having large breasts is not a known risk factor for breast cancer, and no breast cancer information website or charity lists it as such<br>  <br>  Through breast cancer support networks I have met many, many women with breast cancer and most have not been large breasted. <br>  <br>  Women of all shapes and sizes get breast cancer. Being overweight, especially after the menopause, is a risk factor (not a cause); but most people diagnosed are of average weight.<br>  <br>  When I was in hospital for my breast cancer surgery, I was the only one of the eight women there who was full-breasted and the only one who wasn't skinny - not slim, skinny.<br>  <br>  Breast cancer, like all other cancers, happens when normal cells change so that they grow in an uncontrolled way. This uncontrolled growth causes a tumour to form. <br>  <br>  It's hard to see how the size of your breasts could trigger that process|`|54fa0a35bd00b66807cdebfb50bf67ceaa	Nope.|`|Urkb5O8jaa	Nope, it doesn't. Two things used to make it look that way in studies, though:<br>  <br>  1) Being overweight (more than 20% over BMI) puts a person at a higher risk of cancer, and the extra fat also makes breasts bigger. So women with big breasts are more often diagnosed with cancer, but it's because of a weight problem, not because of the chest size.<br>  <br>  2) If tumors become big enough, they make the breasts seem larger. Scientists think this (and/or obesity) might be why women diagnosed with advanced cancers are more likely to also have larger breasts at the time.|`|AA10883080	No, but it can be harder to find because of the dense tissue.
cee2c58f93b765261dc687513be3aa9baa	its possible you have a urinary tract infection.<br>  <br>  some other symptoms that would indicate this are:<br>  <br>  EXTREMELY painful burning symptom when starting/stopping peeing<br>  need to pee a lot (pretty much constant) but nothing or very little comes out<br>  pain in your lower belly<br>  change in urine color...it can get very dark orange-red if you have blood present<br>  <br>  if you have any of the symptoms above, make sure you go to the doctors ASAP. the longer you wait the more chance you give the infection to move up your urinary tract and possibly to your kidneys. your doc will likely give you a few days of antibiotics after they do a pee test.<br>  <br>  if you don't have any other symptoms, wait a few days and see if you go back to normal.|`|3dlBt6vaaa	If you are female you probally have a Urinary tract infection. If you are a young male utis are rare, you should see a doc
JZMfUDylaa	your only 13 hun women don't stop growing until they are 21 so you have time but if you really can't wait then take birth control. my friends and i all took it and we all went up a cup size. just make sure the birth control you get has a lot of estrogen which is the female hormone that increases breast size. if that's not enough then get hormone pills. just ask your DR. about it. and if you want an excuse to tell your mom why you want birth Control then just tell her your cramps hurt so much that you can't take it anymore|`|rtrdOcTcaa	Wow, when I was your age my boobs looked like a boy's.  Seriously.  You're really young!  I didn't have a 34A/B until I was 16.  Count yourself lucky.  Don't worry, and don't try to make them grow - it most likely won't work.  They'll grow when they're ready.|`|cCVvrIFHaa	if your 13 the guy shouldnt worry about boobs at all yo ushouldnt worry about boobs <br>  <br>  your young..|`|PGiOSIBkaa	I'm 19 and that's my size .. Till I got pregnant anyway.  But don't get pregnant for bigger boobs..|`|lfqkhCS3aa	im 14 and have the same issue <br>  what i have learned is that you shouldnt care wat other ppl have to say about things like that, its not like you chose to be the way you are. Not all guys care about that sort of stuff and if that is all they care about its not worth it.<br>  and also maybe you are going to have that cup size all your life but that doesnt mean they are not ok, every person has different body type|`|078934cc982802b25df5c088ec43ec7baa	The boys who only want big boobs are the boys you should stay away from. You are only 13 but will someday realize that we are out there, men who find true beauty on the inside.|`|rFUez4O0aa	You're 13. They will grow in time. Don't try to do anything weird. Focus on your school work.

16VNS9hsaa	whey protein|`|f3bceea3f571ce0b9aeb917dd9b9bd0aaa	In terms of exercises, mix your routine doing exercises in different order, and add in new exercises. You can also start rotaring in supersets (if you haven't already), but also do negatives... In a negative, you would begin the exercise by lifting at the highest weight you did the last time you did that exercise, until you can't lift anymore, then decrease the weight quite a bit so that you can do 10-12 reps of that same exercise. It's like doing an exercise in reverse.<br>  <br>  The mix in exercises, their order and even the syle (negatives, supersets) will keep your muscles guessing and not accostumed. That will lead to further gains.<br>  <br>  In nutrition, take your protein 10 to 30 minutes after your workout this is so EASY yet so many fail to do this and it makes such a huge difference. They spend 2 hours training yet can't give 2 minutes to drink protein after the workout.|`|NKBu3CdDaa	It's time for you to change your weight lifting routine and start to break up your workouts into more than just upper and lower body.  Start with working chest and back on day 1, legs on day 2, shoulders on day 3 and bi's and tri's on day 4.  Rest 2 days and repeat.  Do either 3 or 4 different exercises for each muscle group and 4 sets for each exercise.<br>  Also, consume 1gram of protein daily for each pound you weigh.|`|Df3gXIykaa	plateaus are usually reached by doing the same exercises through and through, switch it up try different work outs to test the muscle, and make sure you add/drop different sets and weights and you'll blast through that plateau
d29M7lGKaa	Wow, this is a new one on me !!!
3GHXk05saa	You may not be done growing yet and a growth spurt can make you tall and thin before you begin to fill out. As long as you're healthy, eat whatever you like, especially if you're active. Eating extra calories will help you put on weight but if you don't exercise it will be fat. You're better off being active so you gain muscle. Flab is worse than skinny, and lean and toned is best.<br>  You will fill out. Ask your mom when she started developing and you should too at about the same age.
4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	1 gram is a dub = $20.00<br>  3.5 grams is an 8th = $45.00-$50.00<br>  7 grams is a quarter = $100.00<br>  14 grams is half an ounce = $200.00<br>  28 grams is a full ounce = $250.00-$300.00<br>  <br>  It also depends on the weed and the hook-up. Red bud, you can get for way better deals because it's sh*tty weed. Green bud, you can get for the average prices shown above, sometimes better deals, such as $45.00 on the 8th. Straight purple, will be the biggest prices you see up there, even more at times. It also depends on your hook-up, if the dude is cool he might hook you up really fat.<br>  <br>  Also take into consideration, that your spending a lot. But the more you buy, the more you get. Look at the first one, 1 gram, $20.00... or a quarter, 7 grams, which should be $140.00 according to the dub, but you get 2 grams free, pricing out at $100.00 because your buying in bulk. <br>  <br>  Now, do the math. You buy 28 grams for $250.00 and you sell back 13 grams, you make $260.00 off those 13 grams which isn't hard to push, that's only 13 people, 13 customers, which assuming each person buys 1 gram, most people will buy 2. So you made $10.00 and you still have 15 grams to smoke for yourself. You basically just got 15 free grams and $10.00 spending cash. Or you can sell more, and make more money, like 20 grams, and make $400.00, meaning you profit $150.00 and you still have 8 free grams. Or you sell the entire ounce and make $580.00 and profit over $200.00 and then you go buy another ounce and sell all that, and pretty soon your buying more then an ounce, an your slanging pounds, because your making so much extra money. This is why people sell drugs for a living.<br>  <br>  Coke is a whole different story and a whole lot more easier, faster, profitable, and you have guaranteed customers due to addiction...<br>  <br>  Therefore, 28 grams, to the average pot-smoker, is a lot. Although of course to a Colombian dealer, it's nothing. I use to push 28 grams in 3-4 days, so to me, it isn't much either. How many joints can you make? Well, that all depends on how much you put in each joint, don't you think?<br>  <br>  When I use to be a heavy smoker (which I'm currently not, due to having to get a job...) I use to pack a full gram in one blunt-wrap. I only smoked blunts, joints are for pu**ies, no offense. Joints are small, joints lose fire easily, joints are crap. Blunts stay lit, they last forever, an they are heavier in the THC category.<br>  <br>  28 grams would get me 28 blunts. 28 grams to the average smoke, would get them 56 blunts, since most smokers pack 0.5 into each blunt. Joints? You can easily milk out 56 joints with 28 grams. Although its not smart to smoke 28 grams, because you need to make some profit on all that spending. Even if you got the entire ounce for free, or you grew it, it's still smart to make profit. Why joints though? Break it up and make blunts, a few dozen bowls, bong hits, and match some people...|`|vbAlVxtBaa	thats an ounce of bud... dammmm you could get a good dozen joints outta there
AA11850523	the rationale is that a combo is a one two punch on the Cancer cells<br>  what one doesnt kill the other will<br>  <br>  as for side effects of each one?<br>  google the medications <br>  ask the GYN Oncologist
RGKdb0wHaa	Your thyroid is a gland and just like any other gland or organ they can just mess up and stop working like if you have autoimmune thyroid disease your own body sees your gland as something foreign and attacks so cancer is not the only thing to kill it off.
loqsl5xXaa	well when they do your pap smear they put white petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on what they use to insert in you so i dont see why not. I would just make sure there is nothing else added to it. and Might wanna always wash b4 and after to make sure your really clean. just make sure you use a new jar and keep it for that. also there is lots of stuff at the store to help with your situation|`|yBlvM7fSaa	If he is using vaseline that he used on his lips, I would worry about gettin an infection!! Esp. if it's the kind you get out with your fingers... Vaseline is an oil based lubricant and doesn't wipe off easily so that would explain the stickiness. You can get a small tube of KY jelly or even a generic brand lube at a drugstore...just make sure it is water-based. I wouldn't use Vaseline for real!!!!

Are you sure YOU are ready because remember this is a Special thing you'll never get back.|`|77NzfiVkaa	It depends on how big he is and how small your vagina is. It will be uncomfortable. I say wait until you are married. No one I have ever talked to (including myself) is completely happy with losing their virginity before marriage.|`|FMwckpMbaa	It's different for everyone i guess. I'm still a virgin myself but i'm basing this on what people have told me.<br>  <br>  Some say it's horrible, others say it's just a little uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Ways to make it less painful though are: Making sure you are comfortable with the guy, taking it slow, lots of foreplay, being confident, lube, maybe a glass of wine?|`|STumBiU0aa	not too much as long as you engage in enough foreplay.  The reason for this is that women need a lot of foreplay, espicially lots of clitoral stimulation, to get aroused.  When you get aroused, you body produces natural lube and prepares your vagina for penetration.  Remember, most women cannot orgasm with penetration alone and need clitoral stimulation - sex is not just about penetration, its about your orgasm too!|`|rmHDABOzaa	For many girls, sex for the first time is painful.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that just because you love someone, it doesn't mean you are ready to have sex. If you feel like you are not in a position to raise a child and remain in a committed relationship, please abstain. Your whole life is ahead of you. Virginity is precious, don't waste it. <br>  <br>  If you decide to go ahead and have sex, please make sure your partner has been tested for STDs and that you are using two forms of birth control such as condoms and the pill. If you can't talk openly with your parents about going on the pill, that is a huge indication that you shouldn't be having sex.|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	That depends on how large his penis is in regards to your vagina width.  The bigger he is and the smaller you are is going to increase the pain felt exponentially.|`|GmTMVmASaa	yes. i wonder how i survived it.|`|AA10450505	Usually, but, as long as you take it slowly and your man is patient and gentle, just a bit. Typically your hymen will tear, for the first time, unless you've used tampons roughly or have had insertion / penetration in some other way. When this thin membrane tears (rips) there will be a bit of blood and some (minor, usually) pain. It doesn't last = it hurts WHILE it's happening. After, you may feel a liitle sore or achy. Hopefully, not regretful. Be very sure you're ready, O.K.? Once you've done it, there's no going back. I've heard MANY, MANY girls and women express regrets over having lost their virginity, as early as they did. In 27 years of counselling, I've NEVER heard anyone say "I'm glad" or "I wish I'd done it sooner." Just some food for thought. By the way - you say you love this guy a lot. Does he love you, as well? You didn't mention - only that ge wants to have sex with you....Be true to yourself. Treat yourself with the respect that you deserve - that sets an example for the wat others will treat you.|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Please be advised that sex under the age of 18 is not legal.<br>  <br>  That said.  If your body is ready to have sex it will not hurt.  If it hurts, dont continue, but wait until your body is ready.  There are alot of other things you can do in the mean time.  If he pressures you even though it hurts, that's a warning sign to stay away.  He can control himself no matter what he says.|`|BDtTWVIUaa	if he's with you for the sex, forget about him. well, that  would be hard to do since you love him. but sometimes guys are only in for the sex and leave you right after. to answer your question, yes it can hurt, but usually it gets better ;). anyway, make sure he won't leave you if it's just for the sex before having sex...|`|Xel3S1W5aa	For most people, yes it does hurt.<br>  But in my opinion, it is totally worth it if you love the person.<br>  <br>  Yes it hurt, but it was definitely do-able because I love him, so it wasn't bad :]<br>  <br>  At first, the pain was the worst, but it gets better as it goes on.|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	I do not know much about what you are going through cuz I'm almost 11 but i heard that it hurts at first but if you focus on the pleasure it is ok.***You  might want to think about it because he might be trying to exploit you and many relationship go south afterward.<br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/</a>|`|6iJYsJfdaa	Yes it does and it takes a lot of time to get used to as well there will be blood it's normal and make sure to use protection.

RSBufJHUaa	A  few years ago my lady and I taped us making love, her pleasuring herself and me pleasuring myself.  We did me last on a separate tape. Long story short, my mother-in-law was staying with us and found the tape (un-marked) and watched it from soft beginning to explosive end.  She said to me, "I've seen a different side of you!"  I'm not sure if we erased the other one or not. We have MANY tapes and not all are marked.  She looked at me with a lopsided grin many times after that.  <br>  Oh, it was really fun making our own porno tape.

XoDUTquWaa	It sounds as if your skin is chaffing. Very possible since cold weather seems to dry the skin out and makes us more sensitive to the products our clothes are washed in and even the nice smelling perfumed soaps and lotions can cause problems. Try bathing in luke warm water (no hot) and moisturize with non scented lotion or Crisco. Massaging into skin while wet and then pat dry gently. Do not rub skin dry with the towel. I think you will find relief by trying at least one of these methods. Good luck.|`|iF5CS457aa	u might have chicken pox or shingles if you've never had it before<br>  <br>  or maybe you came into contact with some type of poison or allergen that bothered you<br>  <br>  If it persists go see a doctor or a dermatologist and they'll give you a more exact answer.

Eventually your parents car will be found and your Dad might have to get a ride to work in the morning from a taxi or a co-worker. You will most likely have you driving privileges taken from you for a while. But you should know that your parents love you very much, other wise they wouldn't worry about you  or do the things they did. You didn't ruin your family, there are hundreds of ways much worse ways to ruin a family. But this isn't one of them. Just stay in your room and everything will be alright in the morning.|`|BcWs38MWaa	im sorry but ur dad spankin u at age 16 mh no kinda weird but well i undertsnd u didnt think takin it would be a big deali get that part n its realy not ur fault the keys fell but u r responsible for it at thi spoint no u did not destroy ur fam and im sure ur dad doesnt hate u i made and still do sometimes make my mother go through hell she loves me but feels disapointed maybe thats how ur dad feels i think u should whait until tomorrow and then see what happens but tell ur parents how u truly feel if i was u i would pray and have faith for whoever stole the car gets cought good luk mesage me if u need anythin good luk|`|Df3gXIykaa	he will definitely get over it, its just so fresh, and it will take a couple days but he'll get over it, i just dont understand at 16 getting spanked?? thats kinda weird and inappropriate, i would be more worried about that..........|`|SCeIOtZpaa	Well you REALLY messed up on that one - I know you didn't expect all of that horrible stuff to happen but if I were you I would be on my best behavior for the next little while, stay quiet, and give my dad some space.  Also, probably want to get a job to help pay for the deductible if you parents get to file an insurance claim.  <br>  <br>  I know a lot of people are against spanking kids, but you're 16 and I'm sure your dad trusted you and didn't expect you to do what you did, so he went a little off the deep end.  I wouldn't have been surprised if other parents would have done a lot worse.  <br>  <br>  They will both forgive you in time - you just have to wait it out and show them how sorry you are for it.|`|khrZZx3uaa	nah you didnt ruin your family. Hes pissed cause you stole his car lost the keys and it got stolen. youll get it back dont worry. very cop in your state will get a notice about it and you should get it back in a week or so. but i definatly wouldnt ask to drive|`|rQWlSJhCaa	Well obviously your dad would be pissed but if had never been angry with you before, then he doesn't hate you; just wait for him to cool down a bit.<br>  <br>  I hope you find your car soon!|`|9oL3lgNlaa	no, he doesn't hate u, he's just really pissed.  It'd be best to stay away from him for the next few days.  srry, but you did a rlly stupid thing, and ur gonna have to take the punishment, and be virtually perfect for a while.  <br>  <br>  No u didn't ruin ur family.|`|QtObwfrFaa	he prob. does not hate you.He just yelled because he was super mad! He should have spanked you since you are 16 that part is weird.I can`t believe he did that to you. Anyways just see what happens in the morning and relax even though you should have never taken his car. He might have lost his trust in you or he is just dissapointed!  I hope the car is found soon! He def. does not hate you though so quit thinking that|`|SRqIIuwOaa	It was very irresponsible and self centered move on your part but if your family had insurance on the car Im sure financially it will be ok. Besides it is rather easy to relocate a car after it has been stolen and it probably will turn up. Your dad is probably more pissed that you took it without permission and with your boyfriend. Don't worry about his job issue, he is a grown man, Im sure he will find a way to work. Just stay out of your parents way till everyone calms down. Eventually go down and apologize to them. If you need to come up with a reason for your action just explain that because you are a adolescent, your frontal lobe is not fully developed and therefore biologically and psychologically it is not your fault. (the frontal lobe is the part of your brain responsible for reasoning- that is why teenagers tend to do stupid things before thinking about consequences)

Morgan, L.M.S.W.<br>  <br>  <br>  Twin Loss<br>  <br>      When we lose a twin, it feels to many like the literal end of our lives.  That is true, in that it is the end of life as we have known it since the moment of our conception.  As one twin explained:  “The day my twin died, the lights went out.”  Another twin said to me, “After Daphne died, it was as if I couldn’t breathe.  I’d never in my life thought about breathing.  I just took it for granted that Daphne and my breath were part of being alive.”  When our twin dies, we must begin to breathe again; we must begin again with our lives, starting with what truly feels like the end.  <br>  <br>      In order to better understand our individual experience, let’s begin here by looking at the larger context of our twin loss.  One of the most challenging things about twinship and twin loss is that the “I” for twins is often seen by them to be in the framework of “We.”  We see ourselves in the context of another person.  This is really important! – it is the issue of our identity – the question of “Who am I?” – this intrinsic perception affects not only how we see ourselves, but others as well.  It affects the meaning we ascribe to ourselves in the world.  When our twin is lost, the “We” is broken.  It is physically destroyed.  We are often left feeling half of a person.  We lose our grounding, and we are off-balance.  We often feel unable to negotiate our world.  The twin that remains for us is both a physical and psychological memory, accompanied now by crippling pain.  So not only are we bereft as twinless twins, but our sense of who we are as individuals can be severely threatened and dramatically challenged.  Therefore, how we are affected by our twin loss depends a lot on the meaning of our twinship to us, and to whom we believe we are as individuals.  <br>  <br>  Identity and Twinship<br>  <br>      In order to better understand our twin grieving process and its challenges, I’d like to take a moment to look back at the beginning of twinship with an eye to the development of identity in twins.  Twins begin their identify formation in the womb.  Whether fraternal or identical, they receive different stimuli and resources in the womb environment and, therefore, have different experiences that affect their fetal development.  But from their cellular origins, they are ushered into the womb in relationship, both to their mother and to each other.  And early on, they begin to show distinct, individual, and also interactive patterns of behavior and temperament, which have been observed and documented by researchers with the use of ultra-sonography.  These patterns are often repeated after birth.  I think it is fair to say that the rudiments of separate identity and relationship formation in twins have been clearly identified through ultrasound during the womb experience.<br>  <br>      The powerful significance of an in-utero bond between twins, and its effect on their identity is more difficult to analyze from the inter-twin responses researchers describe to date.  Much more research needs to be done.  We do know, however, that reports from twins whose twin has died in utero or in the early stages of life, indicate that a significant and prolonged experience of loss can result in the surviving twin.<br>  <br>      We further learn about the formation of identity in twins from the significant work of Ricardo Ainslie.1, 2   His work focuses solely on the experience of twins after birth.  His research concludes that the character of the twin bond and the sense of identity for each twin is fundamentally formed by the environment the twins encounter after birth; most significantly, the twin relationship, that the parents and/or caregivers and siblings help to create by their conscious and unconscious perceptions and attitudes, and their interactions with their twins.  He also found that the twinship experience itself affects the psychological development tasks that face each twin.<br>  <br>      Two infants born with the same developmental needs, in the same time frame, profoundly changes a baby’s usual environment at birth.  The manner in which the significant people in the infants’ lives accommodate themselves to this altered context determines how the twins are affected.<br>  __________________________<br>  1Ainslie, Ricardo.  The Psychology of Twinship. Northvale, New Jersey. Jason Aronson Inc., 1997.<br>  2Ainslie, Ricardo.  The Psychology of Twinship. Lincoln, Nebraska. University of Nebraska Press, 1985.<br>  <br>   The twinship experience presents twins with psychological challenges to their development.  Basically, the stretching of resources in the womb and in the home can negatively impact the psychological support and nurturing each twin needs, making the developmental challenges more difficult for the twins to meet.   In this context, twins will often turn to each other for the comfo

yVbguDvbaa	I fractured the T9 and T10 vertebrae in my spine, my tailbone and two ribs when I fell down a flight of wet stairs at my college.  Yes, it hurt very very much!!!|`|Ho9k4QzAaa	i haven't but I heard it does.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Broke my toe and my finger.  Hurts like crazy.|`|BeSZ4nXraa	I have broken my arm five times.  Yes it hurts.  What exactly is your question? Do you think you have broken a bone? It is possible to get a small fracture that will not hurt so much, but you would be unable to put weight on the broken limb.  There are also plenty of other strains and sprains that hurt as well.  You need an xray to make sure of a broken bone, although by my third one I knew what it felt like :)|`|4d3Md9pnaa	No, breaking something that's supposed to be straight and help your body definitely doesn't hurt. *rolls eyes*|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	YES i've broken a few. in fact, one is currently on the mend now. and yes it hurts like hell.|`|Il6gd3Edaa	I broke my arm and let me tell you hurt is not the word for the pain|`|82tgfHzqaa	I've broken bits of my skull before.<br>  <br>  Once when I was running downhill to catch a bus in the morning and I think I tripped on something and face-planted into the sidewalk. Part of my eye socket chipped off is still loose and I can feel it by pinching my eyebrow.<br>  <br>  Another time I was mugged ad gunpoint and before I realized they had a gun, I punched the first guy in the face and kicked the other in the nose. They pistol whipped my nose and the top of my head. My nose broke, but I put it back into place right after it happened and before the police arrived. I didn't notice the dent in the top of my head until a few days later when the swelling went down and I felt it.<br>  <br>  Generally, no, it didn't hurt for me when it happened. It hurt the next day and for about a week or two after.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I haven't broken anything other than a few toes (the bones in your toes are so fragile that if you stub your toe, you most likely broke a toe bone).|`|mViaFhVVaa	I have never had a year in my life without breaking a bone!<br>  Yes it god damn hurts. The most painful was my left elbow!<br>  Worse thing of it all was my teacher didn't believe anything was wrong and made me to continue in my hockey match finally i ended up passing out from the pain. I think she then understood something was wrong hehe!<br>  xx|`|rHgtiaIcaa	yes it hurts, if you think you broke a bone you should go get a xray|`|KFb3t5j6aa	well ive broken a bone through the skin and it hurts really bad(my arm) but if its like afracture ithink getting hit in the balls feels worse lol|`|SCeIOtZpaa	I broke my wrist - and it hurts.

You are young and if you are pretty active in sports, etc. Periods can be very abnormal. <br>  <br>  Although, I will say my periods started out this way and now I am 24 years old and in Sept of 07 found out I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) which can cause a lack of period among many things. Check it out, talk to someone close to you, keep track of your periods for awhile, maybe see a doctor. But I wouldn't worry just yet, especially if you are certain you are not pregnant.|`|2XnNSOMhaa	dont worry about it...my neighbor went 5 months without her period<br>  <br>  it happens if your active and sometimes if your not (sport wise)|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	You play the sport, and stress and sex that cause body unless period.|`|SCeIOtZpaa	I'm 22 and I still have irregular periods.

rzBxRw7Haa	Siblings are always the first place to look for a bone marrow match although even then many siblings are not a match, even though they may share the same blood group. <br>  As an identical twin however was actually a part of you in the embryonic stage until the fertilised egg split into two, and they share the same genes therefore they will be a perfect match.|`|6fjMtWboaa	Any one of them could be a match but I would start with a twin.

Because muscle burns energy (Your sugar and fat) extremely fast.<br>  <br>  There is no easy way to lose weight, so don't try any of that stuff that says you can in "10 easy steps" Weight loss is not easy, and it gets harder as you get older.<br>  <br>  So yes, as cliche and hard as it may sound to you, and you may feel "But i don't want to excercise" It really is the only thing that can speed up your metabolism in order to gain less weight.
wbSGa7m8aa	The H5N1 virus was first shown to have passed from birds to humans in 1997, during an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry in Hong Kong. The virus caused severe respiratory illness in 18 people, of whom six died. <br>  <br>  New flu strains tend to emerge in Asia, Africa and the East, where people live in closer quarters with their animals, and different flu viruses may mix to cause new strains or pass between species. For example, domestic ducks may carry H5N1 without symptoms and release the virus for long periods, acting as what is known as a silent reservoir. <br>  <br>  In rural areas, free-ranging ducks and chickens often mingle and share the same water supplies. The virus may then be passed from one animal to another and possibly even to humans.<br>  <br>  More worryingly, recent research has shown that H5N1 has changed so that it's even more deadly in chickens and mice, and can now infect cats too. H5N1 is also resistant to some of the drugs used to treat flu (such as amantadine) and it has been proven that Tamiflu does not inhibit the H5N1 strain. <br>  <br>  Millions of chickens and ducks have been slaughtered across South East Asia in an effort to prevent the virus spreading from birds to humans. A vaccine against H5N1 has already been developed, and others are in development. <br>  <br>  If H5N1 becomes able to pass from human to human then the situation will be even more serious as most people have little immunity to the strain and there will be rapid spread. The first possible case of human-to-human transmission was reported in Thailand in September 2004.<br>  <br>  New pioneering work is being done with a product called New Silver Solution.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mrsamedical.com/newsilversolutioninfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrsamedical.com/newsilversolu...</a><br>  <br>  7) ATS- (November, 2005) Avian Influenza A Reassortant H3-N2 - Both 10 and 32 ppm- Killed 96.8 and 99.0% respectively in 2 hours. No virus found with either 10 or 32 ppm product at 12 hours.<br>  <br>  8) ATS- (November, 2005) Beijing Influenza A H1-N1 - Both 10 and 32 ppm - Killed 98.2 and 99.9 % respectively in 2 hours. No virus found with either 10 or 32 ppm product at 12 hours.<br>  <br>  9) Utah State University- NIH Lab (April, 2006) Avian Influenza A H5-N1 Vietnam Hybrid- 10 ppm reduced the virus to below detectable levels in 6 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  Silver Solution vs. H5N1<br>  Helps Prevent Avian Influenza (H5N1)<br>  <br>  <br>  Executive Summary by Dr. Gordon Pedersen<br>  There is a need to find a preventive therapy against the fatal virus H5N1 Avian Influenza. In the spring of 2006, Dr. Sidwell and The Institute for Antiviral Research was commissioned to test the Silver Solution 10ppm in vitro against Avian Influenza. Results from that study found that New Silver Solution is effective against the virus when tested in the lab. The following report is from the follow-up study on Avian Influenza H5N1 which was performed on mice. This report gives a determination of the level that the Silver Solution can help prevent death and disease from Avian Influenza H5N1.<br>  <br>  <br>  H5N1 Experiment<br>  The purpose of this experiment was to determine the Silver Solution’s potential for preventing Avian Influenza (the Bird Flu-H5N1) in a living model.<br>  <br>  The experimental design included 19 mice per treatment group.<br>  <br>  The mice were treated with Silver Solution twice daily for 28 continuous days.<br>  <br>  The mice were infected with Avian Influenza H5N1 on day 7, and the results were compared to those found in the infected placebo group.<br>  <br>  <br>  Results of H5N1 Experiment<br>  Survival:<br>  60% of the infected mice treated with the Silver Solution survived.<br>  <br>  30% of the placebo-treated, infected mice survived.<br>  <br>  This is a 100% improvement in the ability to survive a fatal H5N1 viral infection.<br>  <br>  This demonstrates how the Silver Solution provides twice as much prevention against H5N1 influenza when compared to non-treated mice.<br>  <br>  This data strongly suggest that the disease is being inhibited and treated.<br>  <br>  In addition, there were improvements found in the lung scores, lung weights, virus found in the lungs and oxygen circulating in the blood.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oxygen saturation in the blood<br>  The infected mice treated with the Silver Solution had a greater oxygen saturation at day 11, than the placebo-treated infected mice.<br>  This suggests that the Silver Solution increased the ability to transfer vital oxygen throughout the body, even when the mice were at the most vulnerable time in the study.<br>  <br>  <br>  Toxicology Controls<br>  Mice were given a ten times normal dose of 10ppm Silver Solution.<br>  This resulted in 100% of the mice surviving and even thriving. <br>  This group of mice, were given extremely high doses of Silver Soluton to determine if very large doses would be toxic. 100% of these mice survived, and even gained weight, demonstrating the safety of the product.<br>  <br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  Silver Solution safely helps prevent death from H5N1 Bird Flu infection, improves oxygen transfer and reduces the severity of the infection.

Just make sure to keep around some pads around the house and in your purse incase it happens. when it does happen record the date every time so you know when you'll be expected to start again the next month.|`|lxlFweA0aa	That's really natural for all girl to get scared. The best advise i have is to always be prepared even if you aren't expecting to have it start, also stress can have a roll in when you have. But the main thing is there there's nothing really to be scared of.|`|ZyfilGjFaa	ok calm down the first signs of u getting ur period would be discharge discoloration..... like instead of it being white it might be like a brownish redish color..... then when i started i was cleaning my self.... to get rid of the brown discharge and then i saw blood..... i was scared to...... make sure that u have pads or tampons.... depending on what ur going to use.... then after u have noticed that u started..... slip a pad or tampon down there.... and go back to what u were doing..... u may feel like ur going to the bathroom thats totally normal.... ur not peeing.... its just that the blood is coming out..... and ull feel dirty for the first time but then u get used to it......... make sure u keep urself clean at all times.... and change it like every 4 to 6 hours or when ever u feel wet.... hope i helped!!!! good luck!!! and remember its normal and every girl goes through it.... so ur not alone!!!!|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	It doesnt hurt... the pad kinda feels like a diaper not that I know what a diaper would feel like but I could guess lol. I got mine on the first day of school when I was 12 in 7th grade now Im 13 still in seventh grade... I didnt feel mine at all... I just went to the bathroom and my undies were stained... o yea the stains do some out... like once you wash them there like new...but dont wait days to wash them|`|0kItAwMcaa	Its okay to be scared i got mine at school camp! All you really have to do is change your pad or tampon every couple of hours. Tampons are easier and better to use they are way more comfortable than pads and you don't even notice they're there.|`|jiZ6WD04aa	Well first thing be ready, if you think your about to start keep pads at first and then switch over to tampons. Everygirl is diffrent some last 3 days others last up to a week some have cramps, bloating, pms. others have a simple cramp everynow and then.|`|S1t4e9E0aa	look dont be scared<br>  when it comes you will think that u were a fool to be scared really<br>  just relax and dont worry<br>  when it comes ull know<br>  . <br>  if y wanna carry an extra pad around just to make u safe if it comes when ur not at home do that.|`|aaSlF0gnaa	there is nothing you can do its going to come weather you are ready or not. go and by some pads and midol so you will be prepared for when you start.|`|aPwsYXlraa	how old are you<br>  when you get it don't be scared just ask your mom for help or if you have an older sister but don't worry you'll have someone to help you out|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Hi girl, do not be scared it is very nature things that every growing up girls will have to face, so try talk to your mother or your other girl friends how they handle it.|`|62X7JGBdaa	It will be a dark stain in your underwear.

It's nothing that can kill you. With some females it may be uncomfortable and others have very light to no symptoms when starting. Just try to keep a supply of pads (doesn't hurt to carry a couple in your purse) and some tylenol or ibuprofen is best for any discomfort you may feel. It's a natural part of being a female and nothing to be afraid of. Try talking to your mom. If thats not possible maybe an Aunt or a female school nurse or counselor. Good luck and welcome to the wonderful world of female hormons.|`|C0kvzLiFaa	How old are you plays a big role in this.<br>  <br>  If you are under 16 then its not a big deal I didn't get my period until a couple months before my 15th birthday.  It will come around don't worry. <br>  <br>  But if you are older than 16 then you should tell someone, your mom, dad, aunt, grandmother, and doctor probably. Telling your doctor is really good idea.  Getting help is nothing to be ashamed of wouldn't you rather know what is the problem than finding out later when it is too late to do anything about it?  Tell someone.<br>  <br>  When you do get it you can either use a tampon or pads its all up to you. Periods suck but it is part of life. make sure that if you use a tampon you change in frequently you can get a disease called TSS. You should also keep in mind that your periods my get heavier as time goes on so keep a variety of different types of pads/tampons at your house. ALWAYS keep something in your purse. ALWAYS. When you first start your period might change date epically if your live with other women.  <br>  <br>  I wish you plenty of luck and hope that I helped you out.|`|nWaeTzDYaa	Well I'm a teen and I didn't get mine till I was almost fourteen. Mine was really bad the first year then it got better. Some of my friends it last a week mine only three days. It isn't really scary. Just embarrassing. I've had a lot of embarrassing moments on mine like really bad. It's not painful or anything. Just take ibuprofen once you first get the cramps. If your in school take it before school every morning when your on it. What I do since the first day is the worse I usually stay home. After the first day it's fine. So after your first year of being on it, it should get so much better. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped. If you have any more questions just ask. I'm 16 so I know practically all I need to about it.|`|AA10399079	well simply put you are going to have them every month until ''the change'' comes around your mid life and its normal for you to be feeling this way because of possible horror stories of how bad getting ''it'' is like. Over the counter medications are available for treating the symptoms of ''it'' and know you will exhibit some symptom and it is inevitable but besides that good luck i hope your transition into womanhood is a breeze :)|`|g14dvvy0aa	Definitely don't be scared.  It happens to EVERY girl!!  Either talk to your mom or another close female about your worries.  You can purchase pads/tampons in preparation so that you're not caught totally off guard.  You can also discuss this with a school nurse or your family doctor.|`|n5DlXdsCaa	A lot of girls don't get their periods for a long time. If you're under fourteen, I wouldn't give it a second thought. When it does come, there's no need to be scared. It's nothing but a little inconvenience. Get some maxi pads and some midol or pamprin and you'll be just fine. :)|`|a4212be8d71ac02831257e9e70bec87daa	if you don't have it yet it can come anytime in your teenage years (if you ask me u should b happy u don't have it yet) but when you get it just take a shower and then get a pad and just live your normal life|`|YKGKasMiaa	Depends on your age, usually they range from about age 8-18 to get it, if you dont a doctor may put you on hormones to start it.  Otherwise if you are still a teen dont worry too much.. but see a doctor|`|ozL38FdXaa	trust me it will be ok i remember how scared i was thinking about geting my period but, when i got it i stayed calm and you have to talk to your mom when you start even though its embarrasin i hope i helped!|`|FdBUqDJDaa	if you are very skinny and dont weigh alot it will take longer for you to get it.  keep a pad in your purse at all times just in case.

AA10441869	It is an individual preference. Shaving can cause a rash and irritation. We have pubic and axillary hair for a reason. Trimming and cleaning it up is just fine , I would try a total shave and see what you think.I know I wouldn't like it.|`|0505728aabf6d1f12318dd2e4d00717aaa	It's easier to keep clean, especially when you're on your period.<br>  It's also more comfortable (I think so) =)|`|d29M7lGKaa	Most guys like it shaved!!!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	no it not normal , trim it ...|`|uVMlNvLoaa	It's totally normal to shave your pubic hair. I personally find that it looks, feels, and is cleaner, and period blood doesn't make it tangle up and get nasty (and if guys wanna go down on your, they don't floss their teeth with it!)<br>  <br>  If you want to start out, make sure you have a new razor that hasn't been dulled by use. Using a dull razor can really irritate your skin.<br>  <br>  Start by shaving WITH the grain--shaving against the grain, like with your legs, confuses the roots and makes you more likely to get nasty ingrown hairs. Use shaving cream or hair conditioner (I like hair conditioner, gets a closer shave and you can see through the stuff unlike foam.).<br>  <br>  Some like to apply BikiniZone afterward to sterilize and numb nicks and cuts. Be careful with your folds and inner bits! Sometimes the first couple of times, as it grows back it'll itch like crazy.|`|rtrdOcTcaa	Yes, it's normal.  There are a couple different reasons why they do it:<br>  <br>  1.  It's easier to keep clean during their period because the blood isn't catching in the hair.<br>  2.  They think that guys think it's hot.<br>  3.  It's more comfortable because it doesn't get caught in things, and it doesn't get pulled out.|`|K2dodrKLaa	Yes  a lot of girls do it for a number of reasons, some dont like the way it looks, some find it to itchy, some do it cuzz they think its gross to have pubic hair.. and some to it cuzz guys like it that way|`|SCeIOtZpaa	It's a personal choice.  Some leave it, some trim it, some shave a little, some shave all of it.  It's just what you prefer.|`|xijwHZrWaa	Yeah because for one, it's annoying to have hair there & if you're with a guy they don't like when you have hair there, trust me.|`|Nv0XcFPbaa	Well from a guys point of view it is much more attractive to not have a bush down there.... i girl with a hairy vag is a turnoff for most guys...|`|HouzERhsaa	well yes it is normal i do it cuz i hate hair down there|`|kDvKc3npaa	I do.<br>  I do it because it makes me feel cleaner.<br>  I hate the feeling of the hair down there and most guys don't like it either|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Yeah. avoid germs and smell.
vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!<br>  <br>  Masturbation is simplay touching yourself in ways that are sexually pleasurable.<br>  <br>  As for ways to do it, you have several options:<br>  <br>  1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!<br>  <br>  2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!<br>  <br>  3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).<br>  <br>  It doesn't affect virginity.  You're still a virgin until you've had sex with a guy.<br>  <br>  Above all else, have fun!|`|1d9TrIKCaa	,...|`|TYxbaE4paa	omg..your obviously way to young!|`|K2dodrKLaa	you play with yourself down there and once u find out what u like the most then there ya go|`|Zg9etkT1aa	well for you masturbation would be either sticking something in your vagina and moveing it in and out repeatedly or vigourasly rubbing your vagina that is masturbation for girls|`|rlWZtKx2aa	you are either too young, or you are some pervert.<br>  <br>  Google it if you don't know.|`|Qf11iu8Caa	wayyyyy...tooo....young.....ask your mom....lol|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	ask your parents|`|d29M7lGKaa	Whoa baby,,,you trying to grow up way too fast !!!

EAT. tell your family, and go to the doctor. you don't deserve this.|`|rtrdOcTcaa	If you feel light-headed and dizzy, that means you're not getting enough carbs and calories to sustain yourself.  The longer you are anorexic, the more weight you will gain after you stop being anorexic.  You'll usually gain back all the weight you lost, plus about ten to fifteen more pounds.  So STOP!  Eat.  It's good for you.  If you really want to lose weight - or lose fat content - exercise and get lots of protein!  You might not lose weight because you'll be gaining muscle mass, but you'll look thinner and better than if you just starve yourself.|`|rmkganLQaa	i have only fasted for 48 hours at once before. it was a 48 hour famine for church, and we still drank lots and lots of water and juice and stuff. and afterwards, we all had a lasagna dinner. why did we only do it for 48 hours and why did we eat well afterwards? because eating is healthy! don't starve yourself. you don't need to. chance are you're a lot skinnier than me, but i am happy with my body (no, i'm not overweight). YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!|`|PSyVB2UDaa	Please, Please eat! there is absolutely NO reason to hurt yourself like this. Take care of yourself. You only get one body, one life on earth.

c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	A glucose of 62 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L - the US is the only country arrogant enough to insist on using their own unique laboratory values) is normal not 'low'.  The typical non-diabetic has a fasting glucose of 70 to 100 mg/dL (3.9 to 5.6 mmol/L) but there is some variation to this.  Clearly you are not a diabetic and the insurance company should not regard your reading as a 'low blood glucose'.  Your reading is most definitely not 'abnormal'.  To say whether or not you have 'high triglycerides' you would have to email me your reading at johnerussomd@jhu.edu.  Historically laboratory 'normal' values were established as a statistical norm irrespective of health.  Traditionally white males in their 20s were utilized.  For any given laboratory test a mean (average) and a standard deviation was calculated.  Two standard deviations above or below the mean determined 'normal'.  In recent years there has been an effort to establish 'normal' based upon what is healthy rather than a statistical norm.  For example - in 1980 the upper limit of normal for a total cholesterol was 330 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L).  This was statistically true because Americans have the highest cholesterol values in the world but it was certainly not healthy to be that high.  Today most labs report the upper limit of normal for total cholesterol as 200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L).  The same principle holds true for triglycerides.  Today most labs give the upper limit of normal as 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).  It is important that the sample was obtained fasting as triglycerides but not cholesterol is effected by whether or not you were fasting.  In addition triglyceride readings above 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) are not necessarily abnormal.  The triglyceride level must be interpreted based upon what is referred to as a Framingham (named after Framingham, Massachusetts) cardiovascular risk assessment.  If you send me your triglyceride level via email to johnerussomd@jhu.edu I will be able to better define whether or not you have a problem.  Initially if the triglycerides are elevated most individuals are treated with a low fat diet.  If the triglycerides are high enough however you may require medication.  I wish you the very best of health and may God Bless.|`|onkUcy19aa	What The Blood Glucose Numbers Mean <br>   <br>  In order to get a complete picture of your blood glucose throughout the day, it is useful to test at different times. Your doctor will help you set your blood glucose targets. Here is what the numbers can mean.  These examples are based upon the American Diabetes Association guidelines.<br>  <br>  Fasting blood glucose before breakfast.  This reading on an empty stomach shows how well you use the long-acting insulin that you take.  The number should be between 90 and 130 mg/dL.  <br>  <br>  Pre-meal blood glucose before lunch and dinner.  This reading shows the effectiveness of your breakfast and lunch insulin doses. The number should be between 90 and 130.<br>  <br>  Two hours after eating. Your blood glucose peaks a few hours after you eat. This reading shows if the insulin you took was enough to cover the carbs you ate. The reading should be less than 180 mg/dL. <br>  <br>  Just before bedtime.  A target range for someone with diabetes is 110 to 150 mg/dL. You don't want to go to bed with blood glucose that is too low, because that puts you at risk of having a severe low blood sugar episode during the night.|`|ad3b5cd523444e3461eb988f6ede1f97aa	it means hypoglycemia in which diabetes is hyperclcemia , starchy foods will also bring yours down like it will run ours up, when it is that low you should have orange juice or candy bar or regualr soda to bring it up , if it goes to low it can mean a coma same as high , low i think can be as dangerous as high , as far as tryglicerides go , you may need to be on a special diet like a heart diet , ask the doctor , also they can give you meds for that, make sure your cholesterol is not to high to cause this problem with tryglicerides as well
AA11256693	No - you probably just don't have as much natural lubrication or something. I've always had that issue. Just keep a tube of lube around and there should be no worries. I really doubt there is any permanent damages :)|`|d29M7lGKaa	Perhaps you should have used a lubricant, or could he not even wait for that. You probably did not get any damage, remember babies come through there. Just use a lubricant in the future !!!|`|z5JkgFOyaa	Bleeding during or after sex is not considered normal and therefore should be evaluated at all times. The only time bleeding during or after sex is considered normal in some cases is if you are having sexual intercourse for the first time and the first few times after having sex for the first time.<br>  <br>  Some causes of vaginal bleeding after sex, such as vaginal dryness after menopause or in some cases by the use of certain types of birth control pills are not serious and may be easily treated. <br>  <br>  However, in some cases, vaginal bleeding after sex can be a sign of a serious underlying problem, including: <br>  <br>  * Inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis). <br>  * Sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. <br>  * Cervical polyps. <br>  * Cervical ectropion, a condition in which the cervical tissue is more susceptible to abrasion. <br>  * Endometriosis or ovarian cysts.<br>  * Pelvic inflammatory disease. <br>  * Uterine fibroids. <br>  * Cancer of the cervix, uterus or vagina. <br>  <br>  If you continue to experience bleeding during or after sex, I would recommend that you consult with your doctor/gynaecologist to see what they think could be causing this.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

You can have sex after marriage with your husband.  If you engage in sex before marriage, it might produce an aversion towards it in latter part of your life.  Give your mind and body to one person (your husband) and enjoy a happy marital life.  As far as this act is concerned, it is not 100% sure that you might not get pregnant.  Because, your hymen could have been torn due to some acts like running, cycling etc., during your early part of life.  Do not panic.  Wait until your next menstrual cycle.  Do not engage in such acts in future.  Best of luck.|`|0e1c82c3e51c8fc7239168c6e717e201aa	Yes, still you are a virgin. No chances of getting pregnancy by this way of act.

You don't have to give up all fats, just those that are not good for you.<br>  There are fats you can eat & those that you cannot eat in each food group if you want to lose weight.  And you will lose without feeling hungry.  Be sure to choose the one for  the GI problems because you don't have to buy special foods.  You can get them right in the grocery store.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	Doctors are VERY accomodating for birth control and are usually ENCOURAGING for responsible adults who seek it (the majority of adults who aren't making babies are doing something).<br>  <br>  They'll ask about your goals for pregnancy in the future, see if you're more suited for certain methods, and ask about some of the contraindications to certain pills (like clots, high blood pressure, smoking).  They are also a great resource to ask about other forms of contraception (injections/patches/vaginal rings/IUD's)|`|Gwl9AeJ1aa	why you are wanting birth control. <br>  if you are having sex.<br>  when you started having sex.<br>  if you are having sex with more than one person and have you ever had unprotected sex with several people.. etc.<br>  if you could be pregnant. <br>  what kind of birth control you would like.<br>  if you smoke.<br>  blah blah<br>  <br>  all of it is confidential.

Just keep giving him the tylenol and then check with your doctor tomorrow.  Don't worry so much about the fever.<br>  <br>  WHEN TO CALL YOUR DOCTOR <br>  ?fevers of 104 (40 Celcius) or higher that don't come down to 101 or 102 (38.3 to 38.9 Celcius) with Tylenol or Advil.<br>  ?Lethargy this means more than your child just isn't acting right or laying quietly in your arms. Lethargy actually refers to your child being limp, lifeless, unresponsive, or won't make eye contact. <br>  ?Irritability - this means more than just fussiness. A truly irritable child will cry for hours with minimal verbal interaction, and is almost impossible to console. <br>  ?Meningitis – symptoms are high fever, stiff neck or pain in the back of the neck, vomiting, headache, bright light hurts the eyes. Before paging your doctor, you should also look up any other symptoms your child has, such as cough, vomiting, rash, etc and read those guidelines to determine your best course of action.<br>   <br>  ARE FEVERS DANGEROUS?<br>  No. Many parents have a misconception that fevers are a bad thing and a sign that there is some serious underlying illness. This simply is not true. Fever is a normal and healthy response of the body to an illness. The body's immune system releases chemicals that raise the body temperature.

Even if your girlfriend notices it at least she wont think you're being abstinent because you're not attracted to her.|`|jnuBYMAiaa	The best thing to do when you get an erection, is to try to subtly readjust so it's not as noticeable. If you know you're prone to getting erections around her, then wear baggier-looking pants so that erections won't be seen as easily. Just continue what you're doing and stay abstinent. Doing this will prevent unwanted diseases and pregnancies. Don't even show each other your bodies for you'll be tempted to go further. Just stick with what you're doing and when you get home, if needed, then relieve yourself. This is a good thing to keep in mind and every young male needs to do what you are.

Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|39KUKALFaa	The trouble is that there are great ways to do it available in Asia but the FDA will not certify the prosthetic devices.<br>  <br>  In Laos, I have seen Japanese made 100V single phase coils that are wrapped around the shaft of the penis and are then lubricated with Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn.  The coil creates a magnetic field facilitating the absorption of the Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn into the tissues of the penis.<br>  <br>  While the smell is bad for some time, the penis grows and stays grown with monthly applications up to twice its erect length and up to 3 times its girth.  This technology was developed from the discovery of the effects of natural ferro magnetic fields in iron ore deposits struck by lightning on Panda penis size by a royal Prince in what is now Vientiane in the 16th Century.  The rhinoceros horn is a concession to Chinese natural and herbal medicine.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can get tattoos and piercings that make it look bigger.|`|vfbYDur1aa	I have a friend who literally tried almost everything, except surgery, and he finally found a method to increase his penis size by almost 3 inches and is about the happiest I have ever seen him.<br>  <br>  He wrote a blog about the entire experience that you can read here if you want...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://HowIMadeMyPenisBigger.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://HowIMadeMyPenisBigger.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AwHauqasaa	There are a variety of short and long term solutions, so have a hunt online. <br>  <br>  For long term though there are always traction devices.

uiYbzSX8aa	Sometimes you may not realize it but you are putting more stress on one eye than the other.  For example, do you sleep on the left side of your face more than the right?  You also may squint your left eye more than the right.  Repetitive facial movements can cause lines after a while.  So, think about what you may be doing differently with your left eye, and make a conscious effort to change it.  <br>  <br>  Besides getting more sleep, I suggest also drinking more water (at least 8 glasses a day), wearing sunglasses and sunscreen (at least spf 15) daily.  You may also want to try an eye wrinkle cream is lightweight and contains sunscreen.  I found some good eye wrinkle cream recommendations at <a href="http://www.eyeskincaresecrets.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.eyeskincaresecrets.com.</a>

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	A nasal flush, then to bed with an ibuprofen or whatever pain reliever helps him.<br>  <br>  For the nasal flush mix 8 oz of slightly warm water with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp baking soda.  I use a baby nasal aspirator (but a neti pot works great too) to gently flush it in one nostril, alternating nostrils, while the water goes into the sinuses then comes out the other nostril.  It's kind of uncomfortable if he's really sick, but 3x a day and if he doesn't already have a sinus infection, he should be back to normal in 1-2 days.  If he's already got a sinus infection (green or orange stuff coming out of nose) then he'll require an antibiotic.  But the nasal flush will help, so do that too.<br>  <br>  You could also make him some vegetable broth with a ton of organic spinach boiled in it then strained out.

BRXg8Mcpaa	Wow.  I'm really surprised at how many people believe that depression is all in your head.  It's definitely not.  <br>  <br>  I commend you for trying to take steps to do this naturally.  I would recommend taking at least 1000mg of EPA (its one of the Omega 3's found in fish oils) per day.  EPA plays a large part in brain health and mood support.  Try also to get 1000IU of Vitamin D per day.  Vitamin D is what helps your body synthesize seratonin, which is the "feel good" hormone.  Make sure you are getting enough sleep - try to wake up naturally as often as possible.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there, and if things get too overwhelming, please seek a Naturopathic doctor or counselor.  Your feelings are not strange and can definitely be helped.

He isn't depressed either. <br>  <br>  I have been severely depressed with anxiety for..well since I can remember since 2 years old and I am 25 right now. After my experiences with medication...the only thing medication does is supress your depression rather than getting rid of it. The best thing for you to do if depression is what it is is to see a pscyhologist on a regular basis, they can give you tips on things to do to over come this and get to the root of why you feel no emotion which will bring it out. You have to go in with an open mind and a willingness to talk about everything..and I mean everything. I know it works so much that I know I need it..I just can't afford it yet.

But, find a dr who will work with you on finding a natural treatment.<br>  Eliminate all refined and processed food. Eat lots of fresh vegetables, fruit, good complex carbs such as whole grain, protein (lean meat and fish if you aren't a vegetarian or nuts, legumes and soy products if you are) Drink lots of water. Exercise for at least 30 mins/day. Yoga and walking are excellent to alleviate depression.<br>  Food allergies and sensitivities can cause deficiencies that lead to depression. A nutritional consultant or holistic nutritionist can help you identify any culprits and recommend any necessary supplements. You may need to try an elimination diet.<br>  Sunshine and fresh air are a must. Remember the sun in moderation is a good thing. Your body will metabolize some much needed vitamin D.

It's a bit manic and it seems like we have so much to be worried about.  But what you've got to realise is that you can keep your feelings under control.  Write a list of what makes you happy. It could be anything, anything that makes you as an individual relaxed and content. For example, for me it would be going to the gym and painting. For my dad, it would be going to a football game. It varies from person to person. Now do these activities as often as you can.  Accept that some things are out of control, accept that some events happen through fate. Something that is meant to happen will happen. And, remember, if something bad happens, it happens for a reason.  I did an English exam today and it talked about how modern Westerners are like people drinking from a dirty puddle when there is a sparkly, clean, huge flowing river in front of them. Instead of focusing on the small amount of problems, the puddle, embrace the gifts you have in front of you and see the positive side of life.  Hope I helped :)|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Yes.

Just brush and floss like normal the morning of, and swish around mouthwash. And if you eat anything before your appointment, brush and floss like regular. Don't change anything you normally do, it won't make a difference.

YJrrZo9jaa	I was in the same spot, sort of.  Made too much for assistance but couldn't afford private insurance or to pay outright.  You will have to ASK (they sure the heck don't volunteer this info.) but many doctors, urgent care clinics, and hospitals offer some type of payment or reduced fee program.  Sometimes, depending on what you make, they will forgive the bill entirely, or otherwise you will pay just a small percentage.  But its not common knowledge, otherwise everyone would want it.  You need to summon up your courage and ask, you might be surprised!  I did and ended up being pleasantly surprised.

If she has not gone for at least a year without a period and she is still spotting from time to time, that is probably normal.

pQUr9a5Daa	Diabetes is a serious, lifelong condition that affects an estimated 20.8 million people. About 30 percent (6.2 million) do not know they have it. Each year, about 1.5 million people find out they have diabetes (1) and probably have had the disease for seven years before it was diagnosed.    Diabetes is a metabolic disorder affecting the way the body uses digested food for growth and energy. As a person eats, digestive juices break down the food into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body.  Diabetes GraphAfter digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream to be used by body cells for growth and energy. In order for glucose to get into the cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, an organ behind the stomach.    As food passes through the stomach, the pancreas is designed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move the glucose from the bloodstream into cells. In some people with diabetes the pancreas produces little to no insulin and in others the body cells do not respond to the available insulin. Still others have both defects. As a result glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. The body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose.    Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high levels of blood glucose and is associated with serious complications and premature death. With proper medical guidance much of this burden can be prevented with early detection, treatment and education.    The three most common forms of the disease are type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes.    Type 1 Diabetes    Although diabetes occurs most often in older adults, it is one of the most common chronic disorders in children in the United States. About 176,500 children, teenagers and young adults age 20 and younger have diabetes. This represents 0.22% of all people in this age group. The majority of young people with diabetes have type 1.(1)    Type 1, previously referred to as juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), usually develops during childhood, adolescence, or during early adulthood and affects approximately 5 percent to 10 percent of all people with diabetes (1). Type 1 diabetes is characterized by a partial or complete loss of insulin producing beta cells as a result of an autoimmune disorder. Patients with Type 1 diabetes require daily injections of insulin. Although this disease affects only a small percentage of all people with diabetes, it is associated with a greater prevalence of premature complications and mortality than other forms of the disease.    Type 2 Diabetes    Most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. The pancreas of people with type 2 diabetes makes insulin, but the body can't use it very well.    Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly being diagnosed in children and adolescents. (1)    Type 2, previously defined as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is the most common form, affecting 90 percent to 95 percent of all people who develop diabetes (1). An insulin deficiency or resistance characterizes type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of this disorder develop gradually and are often overlooked. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 30 percent of the people with type 2 diabetes are undiagnosed (1).|`|MYqu4bDNaa	juraj gave a detailed answer.i think it is sufficient to satisfy you|`|ZNbauLJzaa	That's a pretty big question!  There are whole books on these topics!|`|zH8aMM9Raa	Type 1 diabetes is usually hereditary and can't be prevented. Symptoms include --    :Excessive thirst/peeing  :Extreme hunger  :Blurry vision  :Loss of weight for no reason  :Easily irritated or annoyed    --  Type 2 diabetes is cause from being obese or overweight and taking in too many carbs/sugars and fat...  -Symptoms similar to type 1    --    If you need any more info about treatment, etc. on type 1 you can e-mail me or something, my brother has type 1 and I'm pretty much an expert on it now.

yE2vM76naa	I would wager your doctor suggested an epipen to prevent anaphalaxis - a life threatening allergic reaction, and if he didn't, you might want to ask him for one.<br>  <br>  And while you might find something on the internet or in popular books, you wont find much in the way of scientific peer-reviewed data that this is the case. You could try shots, but for many people (about 30%) they dont help at all, and are costly and time consuming.<br>  <br>  Try to think of this as an opprotunity instead of a limitation.
kpKBwOcnaa	Fear is natural but fear introduces to us a range of symptoms that quite frankly we can do with out, you will always have feelings of this nature throughout your life, what is important is how we manage them, the key is not to worry about the the fear but to accept it consider it rationalise it and dissmiss it, facts can do this. If you feel afraid there is somebody outside rationalise it by having a look and then saying to yourself there is nobody out there I am in this case being irrational, if you are worried about your family, give them a call and see if they are ok and then if they are you realise you were having a paronoid moment and dismiss the fear. Sometimes our instincts are great but other times they are basically a pain in the ***, let me reassure you, every human being gets paranoid, sometimes we have reason to be concerned and other times our mind gets carried away, the trick is is to respect fear as it is saying to you their could be danger be careful, but the trick is to rationalise it when it crops up without true reason. Don't sit there fretting on it, drain off the anxiety shake your arms and get it out of your system ( fear puts adrenaline into your system so that is why you feel worried, it is an actual physiological response, that is why you have to exercise it off a bit), do a quick check of things and then forget  it and let it go, if there is something actually wrong well then you will know for sure. Chin up, it is all part of the package of being a human being. It is a function that probably served us well in the jungle, but fight/flight syndrome can cause us much unnecessary stress. The feelings you have are linked to what they call triggers, things that kick start your fight/flight syndrome, you obviously care a lot about your relatives in your life on some survival level so you worry about them and such you get paranoid feelings, I am the same with my father when he travels on planes, I have to ring him to check before I can sit down.

BNAzjSO1aa	A quick and hopefully easy to understand explanation for you  During a meal you eat and digest the fat and carbohydrate parts and these are turned into glucose which is absorbed by the blood so you blood glucose levels rise Insulin is needed for the glucose in the blood stream to enter in to the cells where it is needed.  Hope this helps|`|AA10352420	The blood glucose levels rise after food intake  as the food in converted into glucose for distribution, storage, and for body use as energy It take few minutes to few hours for the blood glucose levels to raise depending on the type of food one takes
6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	No. If you increase calorie intake you will either gain fat or muscle, depending on how much exercise you do. Creatine, protein, whey powders - all just add calories to your intake.    3500 calories equals one pound of fat; if you increase your calorie intake by that much, then you need to do the exercise that goes with it to convert the energy into muscle fiber, not fat.|`|AA11785060	Lots of products you can use, but unless you exercise, any increase in any food product, including weight gain supplements, will just be stored as fat.  So even if you ingest loads of protein powder, if the body does not need it as protein, it will convert it to fat for storage.  Really doesn't matter what you ingest, it is how much and what your activity level is.|`|04XksHiGaa	yes , u will get bigger by muscles and not fat... its like muscle gainer|`|9xgGd9praa	Creatine powder.

Y5rminCNaa	It sounds like your hip flexor might be tight, I used to have the same problem and as a figure skater I visited many docs to aid in my rehabilitation. <br>  <br>  Tight hip flexors can be caused by an overly tight lower back or a problem with the SI joint right behind your hip flexor on your backside. Do the "runner's stretch" or "lunge stretch" before working out and stretch out your lower back by doing toe touch stretches or butterfly while leaning over your feet. <br>  <br>  If this doesn't help, go see a physical therapist because you may have a more serious problem with your SI joint. Hope this helps!|`|omZzhx4Gaa	You're right, stretching and drinking water will help a lot.  Try ibuprofen before your activity to ease the pain during, and eat bananas on a regular basis.

It won't kill you. Might give you diarrhea, though.|`|UXBetwb7aa	The taste would be, well "moldy".  Green and fuzzy if you can taste those descriptions.  Depending on the type of mold would determine it's hazard, if any.  Consuming a small amount of mold on a food item shouldn't harm you, unless you have an allergic reaction to mold.  The bacteria from spoiled food may do more harm than the mold.  "Blue" cheese such as Gorganzola and Roquefort are made by mold being cultivated and mixed with the cheese curds.  Penicillin, one of the first antibiotics invented is made from mold.  So, mold does have it's positive benefits.    Many of our foods are produced by incorporating bacteria and mold as they are a natural product of food items aging.  Yogurt, cheese, kefir, vinegar, wine, yeast for breads, etc. are all made with one or both of these.  Usually mold can be scraped off and the item cooked or consumed.

FdRutwPdaa	Gateway drugs are drugs that lead on to harder things over time.  They get the name because "Gateway" is like opening a path up to you.  And that path is harder drugs.  <br>  <br>  An example is: Smoking weed.  Over time, you are not completed satisfied with the weed's 'high'.  So you get curious, and experiment with harder drugs i.e. cocaine, heroine, pills, etc.|`|1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa	A gateway drug is one that leads to other drug use.  It opens a door to a different perception of drug use.  For example, marijuana is considered a gateway drug.  After trying marijuana, people are more likely to try other drugs.  <br>  <br>  Part of this increase in drug experimentation is caused by the government losing credibility.  Authorities (politicized medical experts) lie about how dangerous marijuana is, saying weed will lead to heroin addiction.  People realize after trying marijuana that the bad publicity was BS.  People will then mistrust other statements from authorities, and are willing to try other drugs.|`|c3BGCFdFaa	One shouldn't joke about these things, but on the lighter side, here's a funny story: During a debate on gateway drugs, somebody pointed out that all the alcoholics he knew started on mothers' milk, and asked whether breasts should be banned!|`|vlouweLwaa	its a drug that can make u want somthing more powerful....weed  is not|`|ykpRiXsNaa	Gateway drugs are seemingly harmless drugs that are thought to lead to one doing more serious drugs. Most people consider marijuana the main gateway drug. I feel that there are many good things in this world that can lead to bad things. Smoking marijuana frequently can definitely aid in making people hungry for something more powerful or fun, but that would be that person's own fault. Gateway drugs should be dealt with carefully, but not necessarily forbidden. There are plenty of marijuana users who are satisfied with all the joys it brings and only all that marijuana brings (or lighter "gateway drugs" bring).|`|GFHRpDE4aa	It's weed, because people say "oh it's not that bad" and you try it then after months you realize it isn't bad then you get offered meth/crack/acid/speed, and stuff like that and they say "oh it's not any worse for you then weed" and you say "oh really" and there you go now your doing everything else,and you get hooked, and mess up your life, it's not fun.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]|`|DtGFWUP5aa	The term 'gateway drug' means a drug that leads as a 'gateway' to further drug use.

I'm 5'8 and 150 pounds, and I think I look fantastic.

It took me a good 16-17 years to realize that I could pull off a bikini, but when you do, you feel relieved. I felt like that throughout my whole entire middle school and most of highschool... only to realize that no one cares or thinks that you're fat, unless you're obviously grotesquely obese (BMI of 30 or more--you're have to be 170 or more to be that!). Just chill out, and realize that guys aren't going to pick someone over you because you think your stomach has a bit of pooch--just make yourself friendly!

R6IYY4miaa	I'm going to assume you're a heterosexual for a moment:<br>  <br>  Double the amount of foreplay. Make sure there is plenty of stimulation both inside and around the vaginal opening. Don't overlook the clitoris. The more foreplay the faster she will come during the actual intercourse.<br>  <br>  Now just about you:<br>  <br>  Practice masturbating longer. When you are close to ejaculating, stop for a few minutes and then work yourself back up again. Overtime you will train your body to go for longer. You can also apply pressure to the base of the penis to stop yourself from ejaculating. This takes practice so you should try it out masturbating first. This can hurt if you don't do it right. However, if you get it right you can actually have an orgasm without ejaculating and can train yourself to have multiple orgasms in one round. It's tricky though, so again, practice practice practice. <br>  <br>  Natural ways are the best to go but if these really don't work for you (I'm talking six months of trying or more with no results) you could always talk to your doctor about a very VERY low dose of anti-depressants. Antidepressants often have sexual side effects such as having difficultly obtaining an orgasm, which in your case could keep you from ejaculating prematurely, or too soon. <br>  <br>  It's important to remember though that as far as male-female sex is concerned that just because you can go for ever doesn't mean you're good at sex. Really, "play up" the foreplay- women love it, and it is definitely the most important requirement to having an orgasm.|`|SltEwVX7aa	dude, it's not a contest.  it doesn't matter who's first.<br>  <br>  everyone who comes is a winner.|`|jf4UOCElaa	get in to a routine try off slow then slower switch up positions then do it again you really cant think bout how to do it because then thats why it happens but anyways pull out for quick minute put it back in then beat her down and you will see the difference hope that i help let me know what happens|`|CKKisY5Aaa	Practice makes perfect giggity giggity giggity|`|2j84hXguaa	Try thinking of your mom.

Go get a personal trainer and start lifting weights.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	1.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	I think I can answer this. People are obviously not understanding your question. So most of the time when you are targeting a group of muscles, you want to do several exercises for that group, several sets of each. So if you are at home and just doing pushups try something like this.<br>  <br>  First for each exercise lets do 3 sets, as many as you can do equally each set, meaning you want to be able to get ten reps for all 3 sets. (or 8, 15 or 20, whatever as long as you get all 3 sets.) We are doing it this way because you are not increasing weights or resistance. So try this:<br>  <br>  3 sets hands wide pushups<br>  3 sets hands shoulder width<br>  3 sets hands close together<br>  3 sets feet up on a chair, hands shoulder width<br>  3 sets with one hand higher (on a medicine ball or stack of books etc.) and switching hands at 5th rep.<br>  3 sets Dips two different ways here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/at-home-exercises-to-get-bigger-arms-chest-shoulder-muscles-without-weights.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/at-home-exercises...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://site-images.ws/images/cust/37125813197204881760875348258230305109/tricep%20rutina%20006.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://site-images.ws/images/cust/371258...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Add or subtract as necessary.

You want to work out to your point of fatigue but not push past it.  Then give it a rest, then get back to it in a couple of days.<br>  <br>  If you're not used to doing push-ups, try 20.  If you do them regularly, you ought to be able to do 40-50 before giving up.<br>  <br>  On a good day, if I'm well rested, I can do about 70.

XoDUTquWaa	It sounds like flea bites. She is small and is more likely to crawl around the small dark places fleas like to hide in. Definitely have them checked since sometimes flea bites can begin to trigger allergic reactions. It's better to de-flea now if that's what it is instead of waiting for an all out infestation. Oh yeah, some people are also more sensitive to the bites than are others.

4ZE8RG7Waa	Hello im sorry you are having a painful time i can tell you the first outbreak is always the worst im sure the doctor has given you some medication to help you. try taking a pain killer and wee in a bowl of warm water if you have trouble weeing. you can get a cream called lidocaine which is an topical anasesthetic from chemists use it and about 15 mins later the area becomes numb and remains numb for up to 1 and a half hours. this can help if the sores are in the 'wrong place' it also helps with the horrible itch that sometimes comes before an outbreak lots more info on site below.<br>  there are side effects that come with taking any drug so please refer to the 2nd site on info about this.<br>  i hope you start to fell better very soon.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If required, take a painkiller, e.g. ibuprofen, paracetamol or soluble aspirin. This reduces pain and inflammation. (Always follow manufacturers' instructions - and don't take aspirin if you have been told not to by a doctor.) <br>  Wash your hands before touching blisters/sores (e.g. when applying medication) as you could introduce bacteria. This could cause an additional infection and delay the healing process. <br>  Apply a local anaesthetic ointment, e.g. Lignagel 2 % or lidocaine 5% ointment (this used to be called lignocaine). These may be used on genital or facial sores. If you need a stronger anaesthetic try Xylocaine 10% spray. Dab on (or spray on) as required to relieve pain, especially before urinating - see below. (These are all available from a pharmacy without a prescription.) Occasionally lignocaine/xylocaine can cause hypersensitivity. If it makes your skin more sore, stop using it and your skin will return to normal. <br>  Keep the sores moist, e.g. apply petroleum jelly/Vaseline. <br>  Keep the area clean: washing gently once a day is sufficient. Many people have found a warm salt water solution (1 teaspoon to 1 pint water) very soothing. Gently bathe the area using cotton wool. <br>  Avoid scented soap and deodorants. It is best not to use wipes, gel or soap in this area, but if you do, use an unscented brand. <br>  Avoid over-washing as this can increase irritation and delay healing. <br>  Dab dry carefully with a tissue after washing or use a hair dryer set at 'cold'. <br>  To reduce itching, keep the area as cool as is practical: try an ice pack well-wrapped in cloth for as long as you like (90 minutes). DO NOT put ice directly on the skin. <br>  Women who experience pain when peeing during a first episode can try peeing while in the bath or shower, or sitting on the edge of the bath and pouring water over the area. This will dilute the urine and ease discomfort. Or pee through a tube or into a bottle to prevent urine coming into contact with the sores. You can put lignocaine/lidocaine BP ointment on the area about 15 minutes before urinating to anaesthetize the area, or use petroleum jelly/Vaseline or Orabase on the sore as a barrier.|`|fk9AvB25aa	I know the feeling, I have had bad out breaks with a bladder infection on one. On another I had an infection of celulitis (in my leg which made it very painful to walk) and a genital out break when it started to clear up. With the infections I had I didn't want to make them worse so I just took the meds until the out breaks went away. <br>  I have heard that soaking in warm water and or epsom salts can help with the pain, also pouring warm water on your genitals when peeing can help. Unfortunately there is no way to predict how painful or not your next out break will be. The best way to deal with it is to keep the out breaks clean and dry, some ointments can actually slow the healing process because they don't let the lesions breath.<br>  At least now you know your symptoms, so keep in tune with them and the next time they start to happen take your meds right away. This can help decrease the severity or prevent an out break all together if you time taking your meds right.<br>  HSV1 and HSV2 positive.|`|Eec9JeXbaa	you don't have to go through outbreaks if you're on valtrex or other herpes medication. <br>  It is one or two a day pill and it stops the virus coming up to the skin, thefore no outbreaks! <br>  <br>  Believe me, it's worth taking a pill or two a day for pain, outbreak free life...plus you can't transfer it to anyone when taking the pill too!!<br>  <br>  go and see your doctor.
GvQHw4Ntaa	How long have you been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo? That's the birth control pill I use, and the first three months I was on it I was an emotional wreck, too... I was depressed, moody, and cried over everything. It's supposed to take three months for your body to adjust to the pill, and I never realized how true that is until I started taking OTC Lo.<br>  <br>  If it's been more than three months since you started taking it, I'd go back to the doctor (maybe even an endocrinologist, someone who specializes in hormones) and ask to try another pill. Lots of birth control pills control acne, it's just a matter of finding one that's right for you. Regular Ortho Tri Cyclen (not Lo) is actually the one that's been proven to improve acne more than any other.. I was on this for a couple of years and didn't experience any emotional side effects, but had to stop taking it due to fibroids (totally unrelated to the pill). <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|AA10450505	Ask your OB/GYN to rx an adjunct med for the emotional side effects.

Much love abd luck.|`|JUk8Hih0aa	I would talk to your doctor immediately they might have an antidepressant that can work with your birth control.

You are probably very sensitive. A change in the pill is anytime better than an additional medication.
RczxgiQaaa	Hmm... where to start... your diet stinks & you're overworking yourself.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't spend more the 60-75 minutes lifting at a time.  Beyond that, your body starts using muscle for fuel.  Kind of counter-productive for building muscle.  I'm guessing you do a lot of isolation exercises.  You should be focusing on the bigger lifts like squats, deadlifts, bench press, military press, & bent over rows.  Those will burn far more fat than curls & ab work and get you out of the gym faster.<br>  <br>  If you're 195, you need to be eating at least 195g of protein.  You need to be eating 5-6 times per day with protein at every meal (no, almonds DON'T cut it, they're more fat than protein).  You need to get a serving of protein into your body within 30 minutes of waking up, unless you're doing cardio first thing of the day.<br>  <br>  If you want to cut, do 20-30 minutes of cardio right after working out.  On your non-lifting days, to 20-30 minutes of HIIT cardio like sprints.  Cut about 500 calories out of your diet, but make sure you're still getting your protein.<br>  <br>  Oh, and drop the nitric oxide.. it's doing nothing for you

Just wait for your period to become regular and then see what happens.
z5JkgFOyaa	Having irregular or missed periods can be caused by a number of things such as significant weight gain or loss (although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems), over-exercise, poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates), smoking, certain medications, caffeine, excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone), eating disorders, increased stress, PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome or estrogen dominance), uterine abnormalities such as fibroids, ovarian cysts, polyps, endometriosis and hormonal imbalances.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you consult with your doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation to see what they think could be causing this if you have missed your period for more than two months.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|c79f90ad0249e7100a8a2e160e66a623aa	wait another month,<br>  then take another test,<br>  if it comes out negative again,<br>  you should deff go to the doctor.<br>  good luck (:|`|DtGFWUP5aa	get a blood test

6PhSENcXaa	The biological and chemical basis of bipolar disorder remains a nearly complete mystery; no one knows what to test for.  Despite literally hundreds of years of examining the bodily fluids and brain tissues of individuals with mood disorders--first with the naked eye, then with microscopes, later with x-rays and scanning devices, and more recently with incredibly sophisticated biochemical probes-- no one has been able to find in patients with this illness any abnormalities that can be accurately and reliably measured as an aid in diagnosing the disorder.  Although work in the genetics of bipolar disorder holds the promise that genetic markers for the illness may be discovered in the not too distant future--suggesting that a blood test might be possible that will identify at least some cases of the illness--and although some individuals with bipolar disorder have been identified as having subtle brain-scan abnormalities again suggesting a possible diagnostic tool, the clinical applications of these findings are still far off.  Modern psychiatrists are left with the same diagnostic tools that Emil Kraepelin and other nineteenth-century psychiatrists had: their eyes and ears.    I have bipolar disorder and last year for other reasons I had and EEG done twice by two different people.  And both of them told me I had bipolar disorder and no it was not written on my chart anywhere.  I ask to look at my chart because I didn't believe them.  There was and abnormality on my EEG test of the brain.  So I'm wondering if they can actually tell something by that test in some ways these two people did.    4 doctors and 3 psychiatrists said it's a chemical enbalance.|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I have bipolar disorder also.  When you say "biological causes" can you be more specific?  Do you mean chemical changes in the body that cause the brain to behave the way it does?|`|FXxQFqqSaa	i dont know the answer to that, but I am bi-polar and I am crazy!  It is genetic though I know that much.|`|qYa9drX5aa	Do you have to go with "biological" or scientific reasons?  I believe that it is all psychological. Probably the outcome of some sort of repressed trauma from childhood or possibly the parents imprinting there own repressed feelings from there own childhood on to there own children.     I have read though, that there are 2 major areas of the brain and that someone who is bipolar, may contain 30 percent more cells that send signals to the other brain cells. So in theory the extra signal-sending cells causes overstimulation.    I dated someone who I later found out was bipolar and the more I learned about his past which consisted of divorced parents, weak parenting, taking sides, (not much different them others out there), I realized that he never really dealt with any of it, so instead he repressed it all.  Repressing all that stuff is WORSE then the actual trauma itself. So all that stuff regurgitated later in life for him and he now gets severe bouts of depresson and then very HIGH levels of excitement. The swings have started to get closer together.      Anyway, if your teacher allows it, it maybe interesting to explore both the scientific and psychological reasons behind it.   good luck.

1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Arthritis, most likely. Very common after a fracture. The fact that you don't have pain while you're moving on the bone is the big clue. Arthritis on previously fractured bones is sharp, burning pain--and can come and go, especially at first. It will be worse if you don't use the bone, like when you first get up or stand on your leg after sitting for a while.  This is not age-dependent--it's a reaction in the bone after a fracture--but it's more likely to happen if you're older than a young teenager--after your bones have stopped growing.    You may also have reinjured the bone--you could have a stress fracture there. After a fracture, the bone that re-grows is less dense and more easily injured. If you resumed jogging too soon, you may have actually weakened the bone. If there are any pins, plates or screws in the bone, where they are is another area of weakness--you didn't say if you had those. The best way to find out is to have an ortho doctor look at it, maybe do an MRI.
AA10186411	Call wherever you had it done.  Laws state that they must keep x-rays for 5-8 years (depending on your state) so they will still have them.
