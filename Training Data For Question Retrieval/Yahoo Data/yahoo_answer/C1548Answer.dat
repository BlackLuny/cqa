Fabr3bRaaa	This is what I found on Wikipedia.org.
AYs6iFlLaa	Sister, take your time in finding someone, I met my husband on a Muslim marriage site but he was known by some other muslims that I was familiar with and married him upon their recommendation. The US is full of Muslims and Islam is growing fast here. There are many Muslim communities in The US. If you think you might want to come this way, I highly recommend Irving, Texas. It is one of the best communities I have been to. They have a strong Islamic community and are dedicated to family life and the education of women. The Masjid there holds many classes for women and the Imam is a very kind man.     I recommend finding a masjid in your area. Speak to the Imam, he will be able to guide you in the right direction. Ask Muslim friends to aquaint you with men that they feel may be of interest to you. Best Wishes and may Allah guide you.|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	i suggest that you go to a muslim country to live turkey maybe you are not in love with europe and we don't want you here|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Assalaamualaykum wa mubarak on reverting to Islam.  I got married at 19 years old, and am in my 2nd semester of college(studying for my A.S. in Early Childhood Education).  I took 2 years off of school to figure out my career path(either a teacher, pediatrician, or working in criminal justice).  I met my husband on www.qiran.com a Muslim matrimonial site, though there are other religious faiths on there as well.  I am also a revert to Islam and the only Muslim in my family, so my stepfather doesn't count as my wali.  My wali instead is the Imam who wrote our marriage certificate, and one of my husband's friends.  Try http://www.qiran.com or http://www.muslimfriends.com.  Or you can try your Mosque. Me personally did the Internet way, as there were NO Muslims in my town or within 50 miles of me. They were all in the capital of Ohio (my state for 11 years).  I met my husband the third day I set up my profile, and eighteen days after becoming Muslim(I was Muslim 10/1/2006), we got married.|`|AA10147081	Wa 3alaykum al salam wa ra7mat allah wa barakatoh..  my advice for you is try to find any mosque near to you, and there for sure you are going to find lots of Muslims women and am sure they will welcome you and you will get along with them easly cause they always seek for Allah satisfaction..and they might find you a good religion husband..  hope u all the luck :)|`|N8QLKpCMaa	1.........  consulting mosque/ molana/scholar .  2..........  any muslim friend or fellow by net.  3.........  muslimmarriage.com etc   go to such sites you will get one for you !    ALLAH bless you !|`|Mw7v9A64aa	Where do ya liv? If you feel left ou' then juz move to an area wiv more muslims innit!  Like my muslim bezz friend don't feel left ou' coz she is friendz wiv ova' muslims in our area innit!    You can find a husband on one ov those Muslim internet marriage website chatroom fingies innit|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Alikum Salaam sister, I am a white western revert also. I live in the UK and find practicing my faith no issue at all. I make time for Salat and I perform my duties as a muslim with no obstacles at all because I don't let anything be an obstacle. Its all about choices you have the choice to wake up for first pray just like the rest of us, your location or your friendships should in no way be an excuse not to follow through on something that is your religious obligation and takes so little time out of your day. Insha Allah sister in future you will have the intention to make your obligations on time.  Having been in many Muslim countries and a few in North Africa too, I agree it is much easier just to "be" a muslim there. I find it so accepting, and find so much freedom I can totally appreciate you wanting to live in a community where you feel free to express yourself as a Muslim woman.  I long to live in a Muslim country also and Insha Allah when the time is right for my family Insha Allah we will.   I am married to a wonderful man, pious, intelligent, strong, humerus, caring and protective.   If I where you I would chat to Muslim friends you have, ask them if and when you feel you are ready for marriage is there anyone they know who is ready also. Is there a Muslim family you know from when you lived in North Africa who would have any advice for you or act as a matchmaker for you as they would if there daughter, nieces etc where looking? Of course there are Muslim matching sites also. But I think its best you meet someone who already knows this person, who is maybe there cousin or uncle or brother. At least then you would know about there character, family background etc.   Insha Allah sister you find the answers you seek. Insha Allah a wonderful pious Muslim man is out there now just waiting to find you also.    Peace to you...
O1QBA5XSaa	I do not discount anyone's spiritual experience.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Pretty much the same as Christian spiritual experiences in a lot of ways, but with either a different perspective of god, or different gods altogether. :)    They're neither "from the devil" nor mere imaginings, unless you want us to call yours imaginings too. All religious people have only their own personal experiences and intuition to go on, neither of which constitute proof to anyone but themselves. You can't prove your experiences are real any more than I can prove mine are. You can't prove your god exists any more than I can prove mine exist. And you can't prove that any deity is any more "real/true/correct/powerful" than any other.|`|ViKjojK0aa	Well any spiritual experience is derived from the same part of the brain, it just manifests itself differently based on your belief system.    You can have spiritual experiences independent of religion, it's all about the neurochemistry.|`|JUcVPFEcaa	Spirituality doesn't have to be related to religion.  Much like morals, it may be genetic.  Haven't you heard of the separation of the mind and brain and the experimentation to prove this?|`|NlCpUWpWaa	To know non-christian experiences go to those countries and get involved in it.  Examples: Hindu then go to India. Vodou then go to Benin(their holiday is Jan 10th every year as the national religion). Muslim then go to Iraq(you can get paid to go there now) or Iran.    Plain and simple. Then report back to us about your experiences. Thank you
LuN1unJ3aa	The first step is desire. I _wanted_ very badly to develop a spiritual connection with God.    I approach religion from a logical, pragmatic direction. It almost demands "evidence" and yet, I knew that science could never provide it. The ancient stories (in the Bible) spoke of people who talked with God, who got direction from God, or gave God's message to others. It made no sense that around 2,000 years ago, it would all dry up.    And yet I see some very sincere and faithful people who believe very deeply in God and Jesus. Their life may be good or it may be bad. Some of it is their own making and some of it isn't. They still stayed faithful through it all.    I wanted that connection and so I studied and read, pondered, and prayed. I accepted what I read as valid. I prayed to know if it was valid. I even accepted baptism, but still didn't know. And I continued praying... for six long months, in private, vocally, and sending a plea from my heart.    The answer came and I cannot deny what I now know. That God is real. That Jesus is the Christ. And that they care about me and you and everyone else, whether the others believe in them or not.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	By denying our own will, and submitting to His; God looks for sincerity, the sincere effort to do His will, and He knows those that are, and are not.
hii5wweQaa	big ego|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	God doesn't need us.  He wants us to worship Him because it gets our priorities straight and makes our lives conform to what we were made for.  If we were created (and I believe we were) it only makes sense to seek out the One who created us.  How else would we know how to live?|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	It doesn't...only the people who put themselves into positions of power by proclaiming their "god" is real and then use fear to threaten those who don't believe them by damning them to the pit of hell appear to demand to be worshiped.|`|0JE41mXsaa	God is Love!      He so loved us that when we humans transgressed His commandment in Paradise, He gave His only begotten Son for our salvation.    So... how are we humans to love God in return?    - Through worship of the Divine Trinity,   - through participation in His Divine Energies (Holy Communion and the other grace-filled sacraments),   - to the attaining of perfection "be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect"    i.e. regaining that perfect Communion with God that Adam and Eve had before the fall.  Renewing the Image and Likeness of God in ourselves... becoming Christ-like!      Becoming heirs of the promise, the sons and daughters of God - our Father.  Worship is an expression of our filial Love for God!

6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	First of all, the seven deadly sins are a classification of the worst vices that were used in the early Church to educate believers about man's tendency to fall.    The 7 are: lust (luxuria), gluttony (gula), greed/avarice (avaritia), sloth (acedia), wrath (ira), envy (invidia) and pride (superbia).     You might have heard of 8 because of a 4th century monk named Evagrius Ponticus who listed eight "evil thoughts" as follows: Gluttony; fornication; avarice; sorrow; anger; discouragement; vainglory and pride.    Some years later, in 590 AD, Pope Gregory I (Pope Gregory the Great) would revise this list to form the more common "Seven Deadly Sins".|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	8 Deadly Sins is a album from Manticora  but to my knowledge there isn't an 8th deadly sin|`|PPvk105Caa	Yeah--Number 8 was Contradiction.....later they realized what they've done & deleted it.
Mizlm9ndaa	I think Peter Enns makes a good point.  When we're looking through a dirty lens, how can we expect a perfect picture?|`|T5ztIAZbaa	I would agree, IF, the Bible was not inspired, but purely a product of man.  The fact remains that even though we are fallen, the Bible did not fall with us.  God said that Heaven and Earth will pass away, but His Word shall stand forever.  So even though we screwed up, God's Word is still perfect and it has perfect theology :)    Hope this helps!|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	I would agree.    In a real sense, an imperfect being cannot make perfection. And theology is man made. We have so many unanswered questions leading me to say our theology is not quite fully baked yet.
uD8d5V9Saa	According to Paul we are.  I think Paul knows better than I do. After all he did travel to third heaven.  Some day I hope to meet Paul.  He is my favorite apostle.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing..  1 Peter 1:8     While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.  2 Cor 4:18     And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.  John 17:11|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	God is a spirit and He is in the spiritual realm, and not until we die then we enter the spiritual realm , and that is all that this means...that is why we as Christians have the Holy Spirit living inside of us, so we can through it connect to God...and through His Spirit He is always present and with us...|`|68QSpCVFaa	no way. the lord is always with us.|`|Auf3qhkwaa	You've read the bible, you have your answer right there.

That's why they do it.    It takes intelligence to work to understand others.|`|EVby6dGCaa	There's a couple of reasons, I think.    One is a desire for everything to be cut and dried, exactly known, right or wrong, black and white.    The other is that these folks genuinely don't want to know, because then they would have to weigh the possibility that their own religious muddles are in need of amendment, repair and even repentance.    Ignorance is literally not knowing something. I would say that it plays a large part in the really dumb anti-RCC bigotry I see on this list all the time.    On the other hand, the RCC has its own problems. Its view of authority is just terrible. So much power is inappropriately placed in the center, in the hands of just a few, and as we observe now, the RCC embodies the adage, "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."    I guess that's why I'm an Anglican; I don't much care for the power grabbing of the RCC, but I do want to remain Christian, which eliminates most of the other folks throwing the rocks at the RCC int he first place. Not that they don't try, but they turn their backs on the wisdom of the Church Fathers at their peril and to their hurt and destruction.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	To try to justify their breaking away from the Church Jesus founded.|`|25qUTYLEaa	Why do Catholics believe that we need a mediator to pray or confess our sins to God?

If you think you really understand the God;s teaching, you should have an open discussion with a theologist of your own "RIGHT BAPTIST CHURCH".  In addition, I would also like to know where the source of your question came from.  Was it the fact that you put your words into everyone else's mouth or you  just created an inperfect lie? You have to realize you are attacking your own "Christian Religion" while you are attacking Catholics because your Christian Religion was derived from Catholics! Next time, please make sure  you understand what you are talking about.|`|6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	Because they are still trying to justify the Protestant Reformation....which is when they broke away from the true Church in the 16th century.    A Protestant by definition is one who "protests" and in this case - the object of protest is the Catholic Church. So, to this day, they continue to try (unconvincingly) to justify their schism.    If your cousin thinks "Catholics worship other gods" than that right there should tell you how much she knows about the Church (big hint: the answer is.....she knows nothing and is therefore in protest against something that doesn't even exist).

People should not pray to anyone or anything else, including Mary. Mary the mother of Jesus was chosen by God to bear Christ but she was not and is not a God and therefore should not be worshipped as such. Same goes for the rest of the saints.....God himself is the only one who should be worshipped .....if u were supposed to pray to mary, it would say so in the Bible, it doesnt say so ....so why are people doing it? Why do people think they know better than God himself>?|`|qfwK2rQvaa	The Catholic Church is the Church of Jesus Christ established by the apostles of Jesus.|`|5UyO2OBzaa	no they don't|`|4Md06LoAaa	They think the same thing about us Mormons, and we don't do anything wrong as far as I can tell, ever since I converted when I was 10. (I had been Baptist before that.)    I think it has to do with the saints, statues ("idols"), Mary and all, plus the corruption of the Catholic church. I don't believe in praying to saints or Mary, for they are not and were not God, and God states to pray to no one other than Him.    Plus, you guys can't pray directly to God, correct? And you have a priest--a fallible man--trying to absolve you of your sins when only God can do that.    Those are the biggest problems.

He said, 'Please excuse me too;   I wasn't watching for you.'       We were very polite, this stranger and I.   We went on our way and we said goodbye.       But at home a different story is told,   How we treat our loved ones, young and old.       Later that day, cooking the evening meal,   My son stood beside me very still.       When I turned, I nearly knocked him down.   'Move out of the way,' I said with a frown.       He walked away, his little heart broken.   I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.       While I lay awake in bed,   God's still small voice came to me and said,       'While dealing with a stranger,   common courtesy you use,   but the family you love, you seem to abuse.       Go and look on the kitchen floor,   You'll find some flowers there by the door.       Those are the flowers he brought for you.   He picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue.       He stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise,   you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes.'       By this time, I felt very small,   And now my tears began to fall.       I quietly went and knelt by his bed;   'Wake up, little one, wake up,' I said.       'Are these the flowers you picked for me?'   He smiled, 'I found 'em, out by the tree.       I picked 'em because they're pretty like you.   I knew you'd like 'em, especially the blue.'       I said, 'Son, I'm very sorry for the way I acted today;   I shouldn't have yelled at you that way.'   He said, 'Oh, Mom, that's okay.   I love you anyway.'       I said, 'Son, I love you too,   and I do like the flowers, especially the blue.'       FAMILY   Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company   that we are working for could easily replace us in   a matter of days.   But the family we left behind will feel the loss   for the rest of their lives.       And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more   into work than into our own family,   an unwise investment indeed,   don't you think?     So what is behind the story?

LqyOHY37aa	First, there is no real question here...    Second. If you seek out bad things, you will spot them easily and ignore the good. The opposite is true as well. Try to look for the good and you will eventually see it more often.    Think about your parents car. Or for those reading, your car. You see that model car all the time. in fact, most of you are surprised by how many of that make car are on the road.     It's the same thing with seeing evil. You are looking for it so you find it.|`|Ah458EfWaa	Yes. God did give u and ur sister these special gifts. i hav a gift 2. I can sense when spirits r around me. i daze off like im imagining something when "they" r around me. i  c the past present and future 2. it sometimes scares me though.  but i get past it though. they always "speak" 2 me without actually speaking. u and ur sister hav these gifts 4 a reason. try use them 2 help people. if they don't believe u and wen something that u warned then about happens, don't say anything about it. they will figure out that u weren't lying. just live ur life like a happy teenager. may god help u along the way in ur life!!!
ceb16f840e65f504a04160992a9e8736aa	Are you sexually attracted to women?  If yes, then you're bisexual.  If no,  then you're gay.    You should find a way to be happy with who you are.

Do you have feelings for other men? Had you been drinking? Do you find yourself attracted to women still? Especially your wife?   Talk to her. Don't keep it a secret from her. You need to be open.|`|8dd6860c003f14d0b36d1ccb66ce5531aa	I recommend you talk to someone about it.   I would say, confront your wife, but she may not be the best person to talk to this kind of thing about.     Maybe talk the the guy you slept with, if he's out of the closet, then maybe he can give you some tips on how to know for sure what you want. Speak to other homosexuals about what made them sure, and see if the feelings they felt when they were certain of their sexuality, is mirrored in your feelings.     Second, if you discover that you ARE gay, and you no longer want to be in a sexual relationship with your wife, then you have to tell her.   Although the experience of coming out could ultimately liberate you, you were still unfaithful and your wife needs to know that.     You must be true to yourself in order to be true to the people you love.   I recommend getting a shrink? Stressful situations like this can really require professional help, and you'd be helping yourself and your family in the long run by sorting your nerves out.     I sincerely hope all goes well.|`|0ZAAi2q2aa	Oh....****.    That's ****** up, man...

Just being honest to everyone may assure you the best pathway to solve your dilemma.  Good luck|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Sh*t. You should take things slow, and explain to your significant other what happened (that is if she can handle it right now). Normally I would say go back to your wife if this was a typically cheating scenario. But since you engaged in relations with another man (for the first time I assume) this changes a lot of things. It may be impossible for you to work out things with your wife if you have always been inclined towards homosexuality. Of course maybe this is just a slip up, in which case this would just be a bump in your relationship with your wife. Whatever it is seek counseling and aide from your wife and others (like counsellors, friends, and any homosexuals that you may know). Finally don't leave your wife right away, you clearly love her and have 4 wonderful kids with her which is a lot to consider and a lot to leave behind if you do decide that you are homosexual. Also don't assume that because you had sex with another man that you are completely homosexual, you may in fact be bisexual. In which case I would recommend telling and trying to work things out with your wife as well as to remain faithful to her in a monogamous relationship. Hope this helped and best of luck friend. You have a hard road ahead and remember that that's partially your fault for breaking your wife's trust. Good luck.|`|6VaXVOCZaa	message me or im me and we can talk

Some of us have learned either by our nature or by training to tap into the sea of electronic waves around us. Its not so mystical as its science. Other people are predisposed to the other dimensions, people who don't understand these things think its demonic however its no more demonic than a lighter is demonic to a backward tribe never exposed to one.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	well they start out by using spell check.      -Christian

Can't do that if we are in heaven.    3. Suicide is wrong.    4. Martyrdom is certainly an option - but that isn't something you invite. God wants us to be wise and loving. Not suicidal and crazy.    god bless|`|9CLmGBSLaa	Killing yourself is a sin, besides, this life isn't meant to be horrible for us, I have many blessings here for this short time.    Why don't you believe in anything? Seems like such a waste.|`|QoenvlFuaa	Killing ourselves would be sinning. Besides, we aren't put on earth for the purpose of enjoying ourselves (although enjoying ourselves is one benefit). We have a purpose to love God and live for Him and share Him with others, in hopes that they will love Him and live for Him.|`|FOZGMadaaa	There are people killing themselves for less reason than that.Much less so why in heaven sake should we join them?    Murder is a sin, so if someone kills themselves that is a sin against God.Right? God is our owner.He paid the penalty for our sin,so we go and sin no more.    Heaven is said to be paradise.God has a greater plan. To make a new earth in which men and women of God shall live. So we trust and wait on him. He will also be a new heaven. Behold all old things will pass away and all things will become new.    Religious people can just speculate the works of God. That is why they comment homicide to comment suicide. They have no idea what God is orchestrating in the heavenly and earthly realm.    One can never be a martyr if they kill themselves in the name of Christ or something unknown. But if you are killed for the cause of Christ.    Well that would be a rewarding event for the heavens.    Martyrs come about for many causes. Yet only the God-begotten are remembered and celebrated in the heavens.|`|XhG1aQunaa	I ran into a stranger as he passed by,   'Oh excuse me please' was my reply.       He said, 'Please excuse me too;   I wasn't watching for you.'       We were very polite, this stranger and I.   We went on our way and we said goodbye.       But at home a different story is told,   How we treat our loved ones, young and old.       Later that day, cooking the evening meal,   My son stood beside me very still.       When I turned, I nearly knocked him down.   'Move out of the way,' I said with a frown.       He walked away, his little heart broken.   I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.       While I lay awake in bed,   God's still small voice came to me and said,       'While dealing with a stranger,   common courtesy you use,   but the family you love, you seem to abuse.       Go and look on the kitchen floor,   You'll find some flowers there by the door.       Those are the flowers he brought for you.   He picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue.       He stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise,   you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes.'       By this time, I felt very small,   And now my tears began to fall.       I quietly went and knelt by his bed;   'Wake up, little one, wake up,' I said.       'Are these the flowers you picked for me?'   He smiled, 'I found 'em, out by the tree.       I picked 'em because they're pretty like you.   I knew you'd like 'em, especially the blue.'       I said, 'Son, I'm very sorry for the way I acted today;   I shouldn't have yelled at you that way.'   He said, 'Oh, Mom, that's okay.   I love you anyway.'       I said, 'Son, I love you too,   and I do like the flowers, especially the blue.'       FAMILY   Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company   that we are working for could easily replace us in   a matter of days.   But the family we left behind will feel the loss   for the rest of their lives.       And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more   into work than into our own family,   an unwise investment indeed,   don't you think?     So what is behind the story?       Do you know what the word FAMILY means?   FAMILY = (F)ATHER (A)ND (M)OTHER (I) (L)OVE (Y)OU       Pass this message to 7 people except you and me.       You will receive a miracle tomorrow.   Don't ignore and God will bless you|`|03c22ee76cbad52a4b0a40b6fab23c49aa	what are u talking about?   People were made to live on the earth, the earth was  a paradise before man destroyed it thinking he knew better than God.   Secondly, people do not go to Heaven when they die....God and angels and the like live in Heaven, people live on Earth. When God restores the Earth to how it should be, to how it was, good people who practiced christianity (true christianity) will live in peace.....on the earth
LuN1unJ3aa	Aside from absurd statements from "fundies" it is an interesting question.    Edit: Since I am not an atheist, I still felt the question deserved a star and wanted to mark it with an answer so I could read what was said (yeah, I know, starring a question will do the same thing).    My feeling is that it was one of those straw-man responses the "fundies" are fond of tossing out which has absolutely no factual information other than some really mixed up cells in their (the "fundie's") grey matter.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	It sounds like a misrepresentation to me.

Why would I care if 3 or more consenting adults wanted to enter a marital relationship with each other?      I interpret the word "support" as meaning "thinks it should be de-criminalized", which may be the same as not caring if other people do it.  Much like I support gay marriage to the extent that I don't care if gay people get married to each other, and they should be legally allowed to do so.|`|XbCHUk4daa	I neither support nor condemn it.

Of course there are many who call themselves Christians who practice these things and sugarcoat the Bible's strong condemnation of them.  Number 5 (Divorce), Jesus said at Matthew 19:9 "I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery."   In the case of adultery the innocent mate can seek a divorce, but they can choose to forgive.  False religious leaders have falsely claimed there is absolutely no ground. The Bible teaches there is only one ground.

If she dies, then the child is going to die anyways along with her.  So you might as well try to save the mother. But that doesn't happen that often.    In the case of rape then maybe if the mother is going to kill herself because of the torment of the rape and the child inside her drives her insane. That's caused by the wickedness of the rapist.      Premarital sex is wrong.    Homosexuality feelings are not wrong, its if you have intercourse with someone of the same sex its wrong.       Promiscuity is the same as Premarital sex. Fornicationn is called.      Divorce is not a sin as long as you do not remarry. If you do your committing adultery with your new spouse.|`|QoenvlFuaa	NO to all.|`|AA12382198	Yes there are.|`|oSME7B23aa	Christians are against most things.

The bible has much to say about 1. (murder) 2,3, and 4 all come under the heading of sexual sins and 5. we are told that God 'hates'.

Christ opened the doors to heaven where all sinners could repent and be forgiven by his sacrifice as it was paid in full.  It is all meaningless if you don't repent and accept Christ.  From the start God said sin will lead to death because nothing unholy can enter heaven, every one sinned so no one could enter. Christ was the one that allowed us to enter because he died for us as a pure sacrifice because he never sinned and he died a horrible death to free us from the old law that demanded we pay for our selves.  in other words with out Christ no one can enter heaven because all have sinned. If you don't confess and believe then you pay for it yourself, you will be cleansed but it won't be pleasant.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	What counts is that he shed his blood for our sins.  Ephesians 1:7.

If some was willing to save you from being tortured to death would you not think they loved you? So why if Christ would save you from Hell would you not think he loved you?    His suffering on the cross gets you a get out of Hell free card if you love him. No he did not take your part on earth so while your alive you still have to deal with the things of this world.      The agreement you make to follow-believe him is to love him and your neighbor. Then because you love him you him you will choose to follow his commandments.

The Quran says "They killed him not, not did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so"    It follows another verse which says "They planned and God planned, and God is the best of Planners", meaning that God foiled the plans of those people that wanted to crucify him..
6QheioCMaa	The best way I can think of to explain it, is, a Mother spends hours making her daughter a beautiful blanket to keep her warm, She comes to her house to visit one day, and sees her beautiful blanket in a dog pen, all covered in filth, and dogs are laying on it. That's not what she created it and gave it to her for.     Everything is created for a purpose, including our bodies.  And it hurts God to see us using them for other things, than what He created them to be used for,     He Created the woman for the man, so that the two will become  one with each other, He didn't create our beautiful bodies to be used to sleep with someone who belongs to someone else, but gave sex to pleasure our spouse, not the neighbor's wife, or a prostitute on the street, and not with the same sex.    A man's body is for his wife, and a woman's body is for her husband.    God never created our bodies to be walked on and treated like dirt.    Our bodies are the Lord's Temple, and is meant for God,     If a person uses their body for sexual immoral acts, it is the same as taking what God has given you and blessed you with, and throwing it on the ground, spitting on it, and then trampling it,  into the dirt.|`|EVby6dGCaa	God isn't concerned; it's the people who aren't, er, shall we say -- you should pardon the expression -- getting any.    Seriously, it seems like so much of the so-called "moral" Christian agenda is driven by the sure conviction that, somewhere, someone is having entirely too much fun.    I get a bit tired of it, to tell you the truth.    Look at Genesis 26. King Abimelech looks out his window and sees Isaac, the patriarch, the father of Jacob, the grand old man of all Israelites second only to Abraham himself, and what does Abimelech see?    Well, we don't know, but he sees Isaac doing SOMETHING to his wife Rebekah (She's pretending not to be Isaac's wife, as you'll all remember from your Bible school, so that the guys won't kill Isaac and take Rebekah for their own), and from whatever Abimelech sees, he instantly knows that Isaac and Rebekah are husband and wife.    They were doing obviously something pretty hot and heavy for Abimelech to draw that instant conclusion, and they were doing it out in public.    To me, that says that the Israelites looked extremely casually on sex, and in fact they probably thought it was just terrific.     The aforementioned Jacob, who will later be renamed Israel ("God-fighter"), thinks nothing of taking a roll in the hay with the prostitute by the road. And his behavior is so predictable that Dinah uses it as a means of getting herself pregnant.    Yeah, they regarded sex as better than sliced bread!!    So should we!|`|AA11297267	He's jealous.  Not having a physical body, he's not gettin' any...so he doesn't want anybody else to, either!    That is of course unless you're a mormon -- mormons believe that gods were once just like us, and got super-duper resurrected bodies with which they have super-duper resurrected sex with their multiple resurrected wives, and make spirit babies to inhabit the world that they're going to get to create and rule over.  That's almost as good a promise for an afterlife as the muslim one of 70 virgins, don't you think?  Too bad your super-duper resurrected personage has to get resurrected-married, though -- no resurrected fooling around allowed!

So, how we treat our sexuality is a direct reflection of how we view the gift of life.  Those who use sex in loving manners show the appreciation of the gift --- while those who abuse sex show the despartion they have of understanding, receiving, and giving love.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Go green, save water by showering with a friend.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	He made a rule one man one woman. Then he said the marriage bed is undefiled. It was part of pleasure you could share when a man and a woman loved each other and it was not to be shared with the world. God wanted it private between man and wife.     Because people will abuse the pleasure of sex and then they make that there ultimate reason for living. They worship the pleasure like its God.     So the reason why people hate God for his rule is because they want the pleasure of sex with whoever they please and no one is going to tell them different.     Its because its Gods law.

ljzb6fZBaa	This is a profound question, and I feel I could probably never be able to answer it adequately because my most fundamental belief, or mindset that affects the larger part of my life, has undergone major reconstructions ever since I was born, and I would like to share those reconstructions, as a testimony of how I finally reached my present mindset. :)    For instance, my family background has shaped my beliefs as I was growing up as a child - my family had a traditional Chinese belief system that is similar to Buddhism or Taoism, which believes in rebirth or reincarnation, karma (law of cause and effect), deities, gods, goddesses and ghosts, among other things. So I decided to study Buddhist Studies when I was in secondary school. The subject appealed to me because it taught about "respecting all religions and practising tolerance with people and their differing beliefs". Nevertheless, I considered myself a free-thinker, not a Buddhist.    So I was taught that life is suffering, and the ultimate goal of life is to attain enlightenment - through many life cycles of doing good deeds to accumulate "positive" karma. However, even though it sounded logical to me at that time, it never really satisfied or fulfilled emptiness in my heart - and it sounded depressing too - imagine, life is suffering! So I felt resigned to the thought that I was born as a human to live a life of suffering, and try to do my best to live a so-called good and moral life, hoping for a chance to get reborned into a higher or better state of being, perhaps as a human being in Tibet or something, or become a demi-god. :)    How blind I was, in retrospect, and yet I didn't know I was in such blindness or darkness - I thought I had the "light"  as presented by Buddhism. After all, it teaches about "enlightenment" - until today, I have no clear idea what that means, but I know it's only a human concept. :)    Anyway, by the time I graduated from university, I continued to find life meaningless. I read books on philosophy, and found no satisfying answers to the meaning of life. I read new age books, like "Conversations with God", and for a while, I thought I found some answers. Later, I came to realise it contains half-truths, which are deceptive. I also read books on Tibetan and Vietnamese buddhism, and books by Dalai Lama. Oh, the teachings on wisdom and happiness may have some observations about life, but I still haven't found what I was looking for - as the U2 song goes - the true meaning of life. :)    Somehow, by 2001, I was open to Christianity again, having been introduced to it by friends and acquaintances on and off since childhood and school, and I accepted a colleague's invitation to go to church.     By then, I already had a NIV Bible which was given to me by a university schoolmate when I attended her weekly cell group meetings. I began to read the Bible for myself, and soon I came to Ecclesiastes 1 where it says "Meaningless, meaningless, life is meaningless!" I was amazed to learn that the Bible also talks about the philosophy of life, and how those words resonated in my heart because that was how I felt! So I continued to read the Bible and later came to Isaiah 55 where it says God's ways are higher than my ways and His thoughts are higher than my thoughts - and I found myself agreeing, for I acknowledged that my understanding of God and everything else is limited, compared to His understanding. :)    Besides God's words speaking to me from the Bible, making sense in my heart, I also experienced love and kindness from my christian friends, who welcomed me in their church and did not pressure me to believe in Jesus, and I felt I have done nothing to deserve their kindness. That's how I came to know and experience God' grace - His undeserved favour - which goes against the grain of what I had been taught in Buddhism, which focuses on earning merits through doing good deeds.    Thus, that was the turning point, I believe, when I finally made the decision to accept Christ in July 2002, having believed that God is real in my life after all, through acknowledging His ways working in my life through people and through the Bible. So I said a prayer to God on 31 July 2002 in my bathroom, to receive Jesus Christ to be my Lord and Saviour, to forgive my sins. I began to attend church on my own. However, I didn't fully understand God's grace or undeserved favour until I started attending my present church in June 2003, which preaches the pure gospel of grace uncompromisingly. Even so, I am still discovering and understanding God's grace today because His grace is like a finely crafted diamond - every which way we turn, we see new aspects of His glory. Grace, after all, is not a doctrine or concept, but is a Person of Jesus Christ. For "the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." (John 1:17) :) Can we fully know Jesus in all His fullness in this lifetime? No, I don't think so, but we can grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. (2 Peter 3:18)    So then, I have finally reached my present belief or mindset which profound affects everything I do, say or think in my life - and I don't really have a "perfect" statement to say exactly what this mindset is, but suffice to say that it has to do with believing in Jesus - who is Grace personified. He is everything I need in my life - He is my wisdom, righteousness, holiness and redemption. (1 Corinthians 1:30) One poem I wrote recently summarised it like this (based partly on Romans 5:17):    Grace is all I need  Righteousness is what I receive  As a gift from God  Christ is my All in All  Every moment of my life    This is the sum total of the gospel of grace, and yet there is so much more to elaborate from this gospel alone, bearing in mind the thickness of the Bible itself, and the Bible - when it comes down to it - is |`|wzU9VUt2aa	There is no point in worrying about what you cannot control.

I had to take some time before I answered because it deserves a serious & authentic answer. It is not a simple thing to state, there is no one line answer for me.  I believe there is a Source but that many have great misunderstandings as to the nature of the One. I believe the Divine can not be labeled, to do so who only limit him. I believe that we are much more than we think we are or appear to be here & that many make themselves small in a misguided attempt at humility, truly not understanding the nature of true humility. I believe that most of us sleep never realizing that what we see is a shadow of a dream of a lie. I believe that separation is one of the fundamental lies we have come to accept, & if this fundamental lie were to crumble the rest would all just fall upon itself. I believe that my brother is myself, & what reflects back to me, what I see in him, is my vision of myself. I believe that real Love is something completely different than what the world understands Love to be. I believe there is but one son of God, & we are it. I believe I don't have to know all the answers, but I did have learn to go to where the answers are. I believe gratitude is the truest form of prayer, it is then that The father knows the Son received his message.  Thank You for this question!  Blessings!

Although it sounded alarming, I didn't think much about it at the time because it didn't affect anyone I knew.   Little more than 20 years later the disease has reached pandemic proportions, with an estimated 40 million infected and more than 25 million dead from AIDS and HIV-related causes. When AIDS attacks, it decimates every aspect of society: education, financial stability, community and family structure. In short, AIDS kills far more than people; it kills the future.     Initially, inaction, indifference, apathy and even judgment kept much of the world from responding to the crisis in a timely fashion, allowing it to reach pandemic proportions. But there is hope.     I learned recently that in some African nations there are signs of fewer infections being recorded because of the efforts of people who have taken on the responsibility of combating the problem. The United Nations, nongovernmental organizations, ministries, churches, civic groups and government-sponsored programs are doing what they can to halt the spread of AIDS.     Some are educating, others are treating the sick and dying, and still others are caring for orphans. Organizations, corporations and philanthropic individuals are joining together for the purpose of staying the human carnage, and their efforts are making a difference.     About 20 years ago, the church began experiencing a problem that led to its own form of "AIDS" pandemic: Absent Indifferent Disconnected Saints. It, too, has resulted in many "deaths"spiritual deaths that have caused people to disconnect from the church. It is estimated that 13 million Christians (individuals who have been identified as having had a genuine salvation experience) have left the church in the U.S. since the early 1980s.     This crisis is of great importance to all of us because the church plays a major role in the life of the believer. It provides human lives with physical, spiritual, sociological, and even psychological structure and security.     When a person is born again, he is added to the universal church and, equally important, to the local church. As a social community and the foundation of our faith, the church is critical to our spiritual and physical well-being, and its health must be of paramount interest to us.     More important, we are commanded by God to build and sustain the church. The church is God's means to communicate His salvation to the lost. As children of God, it is our responsibility and our privilege to be engaged in the building and maintenance of the church.     When we lose members, we all lose. Those who have left the church lose, and the church loses. Their pain and sense of separation is our loss. The only winner is the devil.     The Valley of Dry Bones     In early 2005 I had an encounter with the Lord in which He showed me His plan for restoring the church. He was calling for powerful change, restoration and revival. I was drawn to the following Scripture passage, knowing that the God who raised the dry bones in Ezekiel's day could awaken a church of dry bones in our time.     "The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry.     "And He said to me, 'Son of man, can these bones live?' So I answered, 'O Lord God, You know.' Again He said to me, 'Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, "O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!"  and you shall live. Then you shall know that I am the Lord' (Ezek. 37:1-6, NKJV).     The prophet Ezekiel saw the Valley of Dry Bones through the Spirit. This valley depicted the nation of Israel, which was in a state of spiritual death from being defeated in battle. Israel had been promised conquest over her enemies, but the people had turned away from God and faced humiliation and defeat. The Israelites needed to be brought back to life.     What God showed Ezekiel was not only the spiritual state of Israel and their need for revival but also the role the prophet had to play in the process of revival. I believe there is a message here for us. How can we apply this portion of Scripture to our lives and to the state of the church today?     It is important to note that Ezekiel did not act on his own initiative. It was only after he received a divine vision that he became involved and began to prophesy. His voice became the medium for God's Spirit to move over the dry bones.     The Bible tells us that without a vision people perish or are unrestrained, a law unto themselves (see Prov. 29:18). Without a vision, they are not committed to God's priority. It takes vision to mobilize a person to undertake what is seemingly impossible. But when man does his part, God will do His part.     God asked the prophet the question,|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	More Bible preaching and teaching.

wRBfUgI2aa	My mother was from a JW family while my dad was not.  By the time I came along both were JWs.    Though I was raised in the "Truth', I studied to find it on my own as well.  This is a necessary step.  Just mouthing the words does not work.  Knowing for yourself what is true from false and then taking the truth into your heart to become a part of you is what separates real Witnesses of Jehovah.    The ex-JWs here only mouthed the words.  They never applied Bible council.  Many preferred this old wicked world's flashiness.      The rewards for leading a life pleasing to Jehovah are largely internal for now.  Material pleasures are understood to be of little value.  Remember the Old West of the US?  Wagon trains would head out with all the life goods of a family only to be tossed out along the trail as surviving became more important than holding on to material goods.    JWs have that same view.  We are attempting to get through to earth under God's Kingdom rule.  What does it matter if we toss out a few things?  We will get better things when we get to our destination.  Everlasting life in a paradise with rulers we can actually count on as friends & family.  Ones who actually can and will solve problems with the power to accomplish solutions.    No reposessions, foreclosures, no wars, famines or epidemics.  No swindles.

I was visiting my grandmother who was not a witness, and I wanted to go visit my cousin who lived in the same area. My nana warned me not to let her talk to me about religion, because she had some negative misconceptions about witnesses. Instead of discouraging me, it backfired because I was so curious. I asked my cousin a bunch of questions about her beliefs. She ALWAYS used the Bible. I attended a session of the district convention, and read the newly released "You Can Be God's Friend!" brochure. I was convinced this was the truth.

My mother had been getting magazines for years so I asked the sister who was giving my mother magazines if she would answer my questions she said that the best way was through a study she suggested that since I was dating an associated wittiness that I start in the YPA book.

BMQlzUkfaa	That's why you need to ask God about which church to join just as Joseph Smith did.      10 In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?     11 While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.     12 Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.     13 At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to ask of God, concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.     If you want to know which church is the true church you are going to have to do as James directed, the same thing that Joseph Smith did, and pray about it.|`|Op81lhjuaa	Truth is not a feeling. Truth is not an idea. The truth is found in the Bible. The cults are wrong because they do not have the truth. That is, they have a false understanding of God the Father, of God the Son, of the Holy Spirit, and the work of Christ on the Cross. Because they are in error in these things, they are in error concerning the doctrine of salvation.    Sincerity and good works do not bridge the gap of sin between God and man. Only the blood of Jesus can cleanse a person (Heb. 9:22; John 14:6). Sincerity and good works are merely the reliance upon what is in the individual to merit favor with God. Sincerity is a form of pride when it is appealed to as a justification for being accepted by God: "But God, look at my heart. See how sincere I was? I deserve to be in heaven."    No. If sincerity and good works were good enough to satisfy God, then He wouldn't have given us the Bible to correct our sincerely wrong ideas, and He wouldn't have sent His Son to do what our good works cannot.

How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various claimants to the ultimate truth, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept with regards to Allah. They either claim that all men are gods or that specific men were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man's imagination.  Thus, it may be stated that the basic message of false religion is that Allah may be worshipped in the form of His creation. False religion invites man to the worship of creation by calling the creation or some aspect of it God. For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah!  Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles to the religion of India. He did not claim to be God nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object of worship. Yet, today most Buddhists who are to be found outside of India have taken him to be God and prostrate to idols made in their perception of his likeness.   By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived nature of their origin clear. As God said in the Our'aan:  " That which you worship besides Him are only names you and your forefathers have invented for which Allah has sent down no authority: The command belongs only to Allah:  He has commanded that you only worship Him; that is the right religion, but most men do not understand ".  (Soorah Yoosuf 12:40)  It may be argued that all religions teach good things so why should it matter which one we follow. The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil, the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation. Man was created to worship Allah alone as Allah has explicitly stated in the the Quran:  " I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me "  (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)  Consequently, the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only unforgivable sin. One who dies in this state of idolatry has sealed his fate in the next life. This is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by Allah in his final revelation to man.  The following criteria can best serve as a gauge to find out the authenticity of the last revelation (the Quran) as words of God:  1. Rational Teachings: Since our Creator bestowed reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use it to distinguish the TRUTH from falsehood. True, undistorted revelation from God must be rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds.   2. Perfection: Since our Creator is all perfect, His revelation must be perfect and accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and multiplicity of versions. It should be free from contradictions in its narration.   3. No Myths or Superstitions: True revelation is free from myths or superstitions that degrade the dignity of our Creator or man himself.   4. Scientific: Since our Creator is the Creator of all knowledge, true revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at all times.   5.

rkEXGEgoaa	Sounds like you had a fun day geezer, I bet you will sleep well tonight. I am also glad you got them back, we can't let the youngens know how old we really are or there will be a mutiny.    It has probably been 3 years since I really played in the snow, we went to the hills tubing, like sledding only on inner tubes, We did have so much fun. I guess it is time to do it again.|`|AA12258992	Over 30 years, because I moved to Florida.    If I still lived up north, I would be playing in the snow, and loving it!    I really don't miss it that much, though.  I love the warm weather here.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	Hello Geezer.  We just came in a few hours ago.  Dug the cars and sidewalk out.  Managed to throw a few shovels on the husband and youngest pleading "oh geez I'm SOOOOOO sorry."  They got me back anyway.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I'd have to drive up the mountain to the snow.

I live about 25 minutes from Big Bear where there is snow but I just end up driving through then going to the desert then on to the beach for a nice sea food dinner and then back to the foothills below Crest line / Big Bear. Played in it all the time in Indiana, im in Cali now.|`|UllYFJgjaa	It's sad, but 1997 was the last time I enjoyed the snow. I actually made a snow angel then and it came out nice.

I grew up in the midwest and then moved to NY for 12 years so when I finally moved to California, ti was to get away from teh snow and frigging cold.  I don't miss snow although I miss the mental romantic idea of snow (ya know, the movies with white christmas snow and no one gets cold and no one's nose starts leaking and it's never so cold you almost can't breath).  I do remember watching snow from the safety and relative warmth of inside--especially that lovely night snow falling past the light posts muffing the sounds of cars and buses driving past, covering everything in nice clean whiteness at least for a little while.  But I don't want to be in snow ever, I could go to Tahoe or Yosemite or Shasta if I wanted to be in snow.  Thanks but I'll pass.|`|AA11296212	Two hours ago...Oh, wait I wasn't playing, I was snowblowing!|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	It's been to long .

Now, to answer your question directly, I recently took advantage of the infrequent snowfall in southern Ca (I live at elevation 5000 ft so it occurs here occasionally) around Xmas time. I fired a couple snowballs and my cold hands combined w/ ackowledgement of the natural decay of my faculties possessed me to feel duly accomplished by my accurate tosses at my human targets before I playfully scampered in to the warmth of the hearth ... lol ... thanks for the GREAT question  ... :)    got one of the targets in the head ... yup, I still got some of my God given talent ... nuf sed|`|2R3iJnFPaa	It rarely  snows here, so,close to 50 years ago.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Ahhhhhhhh!

Thanks for sharing that.|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	It's been six or more years since we had enough snow here to play in.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Well good for you, that you were able to play and still get up by  yourself. That was the last time I think I played. Actually, I only made  a snow angel. But that should count. I think that was back in the  80's, when we had plenty of snow that year.      I don't play in snow anymore. Mainly, because for fear of falling.And also, we rarely get snow. Certainly not every year. And often after several years. I also don't like walking  in it, without boots. I had some, but both were stolen last summer during a moving situation. So now I have shoes with slippery bottoms.      But I love to see someone having a good time in the snow. I have  yet to see someone in my age group play or even throw snowballs  any more. Guess the fun's gone out of them. I wonder why none of  the kids try to build a fort these days. I haven't seen one, since I was  a kid. Not even our kids or their friends built one, or anywhere in our neighborhoods. Maybe it's a lost art, or kids just don't want to spend as much time in the snow, and be away from their electronic or computer games I regret there's been too many changes in what kids like today. In comparison to when we used our imaginations as kids outside. So I am glad, I still can remember, and enjoy those memories. I hate to think of the day, when my memory is kaput. That will be a sorry time.|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	This is very similar to whether I favor a tub bath or a shower.  I forgot who asked that.    My answer to that was, "If I got into a tub, the fire department would have to get me out."    My answer to this:  "If I found myself on the ground in the snow, the fire department would have to get me up."|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	awwh! thats so cute! ^_^ haha...i love little kids...i havent played in the snow since maybe like 3 yrs ago...ahh i miss those good times *sigh* lol|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Not long enough! 6 more inches today! sledding all day! woohoo!!!

I'm 52 and she's 24....we had lots of fun!!!!|`|AA10181795	Last year, I think. We haven't had much to speak of this year, just icey rain.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	It's been awhile.  We have so much snow, for so long, that I do what needs doing, and get inside.  It's usually too cold to stay out for long.  Northern Canada.  I'm happy for you, though.|`|R32J8Z4Yaa	It's been a long time since I actually played in the snow, but last night it was snowing so I put a big bowl on the back porch to collect snow for snow ice cream.  Well it snowed so much, 12 inches, that I had to go out there to find it and dig it up.  It was completely covered.  But we will get our snow ice cream this year - yum!|`|gCAJaFnyaa	It's been awhile for me as well.  We moved from Northern ME in '93, and had to leave our snowmobiles behind.  Were they fun!    Now we live in TX(San Antonio area), and we don't get much snow here.    Although the snow is beautiful, and I don't have to worry about getting to work, I still don't miss it.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	We sled down our drive way every year. It is way fun, we have a rudder sled like the ones we had when we were kids. The driveway is long and winds 2 directions and when the base is perfect you can fly down that road into the meadow below. Its a private driveway so there is no traffic except my pesky little dogs that run along side and take a nip at you  once in a while. Last year I did my personal best all the way to the middle of the meadow below.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	It never snows in Cebu City, however two weeks ago it was 23 degrees celsius and windy, coldest day in a year.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	You shouldn't be "trippin" with the kids!!!

LuN1unJ3aa	Because people are _still_ upset over the passage of Prop 8 and won't let it drop. If they didn't bring it up, Christians would focus on something else.    It takes two -- one for each side of the issue. It is one of the few moral issues that is currently facing people in general.    The other major issue, considered to be moral, has to do with abortion.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	We don't.  The issue, for example, was just on the ballot in California, so of course it's been discussed.  When something is brought up, we address is based on what the bible has to say.|`|69bp1IMfaa	Because it's a big crime in our society.|`|rZmJGPidaa	Because most Christians incorrectly assume from misinterpretation of scripture and inability to exercise free thought that homosexuality is a horrible sin, punishable by death.    In their immense "love" for homosexuals, they act to convert them by threatening them with damnation.     Remember, eating shellfish is an abomination too.|`|DYnvacFVaa	Because homosexuals constantly come on here asking us what our views are on the subject, and we can only tell them its a sin based on the Bible.  I dont care about what gay people do, it is of no interest to me, no one i know even talks about it, the only people that seem to constantly bring it up is the homosexuals.|`|RedEGIfZaa	It's one of the last acceptable prejudices, and they see the tide turning.

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Does it count if my WIFE is non-denominational?  hehehehehehe  OK,  good, then I just squeaked in under the door. hehehehehe  PHEWW!    BRAVO for thinking ahead. For giving this some actual honest THOUGHT.  Amazing how people don't want to think about things until they are "there" -- in the moment.  By which time they have usually gone to far for their personal will power.      Everyone's will power is different. Your friends might be able to go much father then you and still have total control.  While you or someone else might get to a boiling point MUCH earlier.    Generally speaking,  and this goes even for things OTHER then sex,  we generally don't realize where the line is until we cross it.  RIGHT?    So, again,  Marvelous for you for thinking ahead!  -- You're already ahead of the 99% of people these days!    As for my answer:    I think you already know your boundaries if you think feeling you up is too far.  That probably means you don't think you'll be able to do that and not go too far.  -- Go with what your gut tells you ahead of time..verses what your gut MIGHT tell you when you are "in the moment"  and caught up in emotion.     I don't think there is anything wrong with him having dreams.  He is not awake and therefore not in control of his dreams.  He should try his HUMANLY best to not dwell on them and make you primarily an object of lust.  BUT, there is a large gray area in between those 2 extremes.  I wouldn't make him feel bad about it,  but I obviously wouldn't encourage it and play into it, either, but I'm sure you aren't doing that. - Anotherwards, it is what it is.  He should know when it is unhealthy and ask God for help with that....so have a small amount of faith in his beliefs and character and not worry about it.    He is correct in one aspect.. merely thinking about it in the context of marriage is not wrong.  -- I mean on some level that SHOULD be physical attraction as PART of your relationship before you get married. That is 1 aspect of it.  So his dreams or occasional thoughts only illustrate that this 1 component of your relationship is working correctly, as it should.     However, as you know.. there is a proper place and time for everything.  You already know this which is why you ask the questions you do.    But to answer your original question..  Figure out if you can handle his touching you.  The ULTIMATE goal is to not go to far.  I'd say being naked in front of him is.  Being in a bathing suit isn't.  having him touch you on your clothes.. well that's up to YOU,  but I don't think it is automatically wrong.|`|RedEGIfZaa	You are both consenting adults.  Feel free to engage in whatever sexual activities you feel comfortable with.|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	nothing wrong with dreams just don't let them strengthen into lustful thoughts.    your boundaries? well that's up to you.    Mine are me and my gf cannot touch each other any place a bikini would cover.|`|QoenvlFuaa	Good for the two of you being open about this. Knowing what the other wants and doesn't want is very important. There is nothing wrong with talking about your sexual relationship and setting boundaries.     As for you feeling "iffy" about how far you go...I would say that is too far if you aren't completely comfortable with it (I'm not even sure what "feeling" means; terms can mean different things to different people).     As for him having dreams about sex...that's a boy for you! lol  But seriously, it's normal to have occasional dreams about sex, male or female.     Just always be completely open and honest with each other and stick to your boundaries. When you do get married (whether it is to him or someone else), you will be so glad that you set and kept boundaries. The prize is greater after marriage.|`|38a52321b2736bfedffcf55448d70c67aa	I am a nondenominational christian and I believe you should wait for marriage to be close physically in every way. It is a treasure that God wants you to save because in a committed marriage relationship you make a commitment to each other and God and studies have shown that when two people wait until they are married to be Intimate their relationship lasts. As far as your bf thinking about doing things with you it IS wrong because you are not yet his wife. Our thinking is to be pure. He needs to treat you more like a sister in the Lord and you are to treat him as a brother in the Lord, until your married. If he is thinking pure thoughts about you he won't have sexual dreams about you either. If pure thoughts is something he struggles with that is a red flag you should be aware of because the Bible says every action we have is because we thought about it first. As a man thinks in his heart so is he.|`|AA10394102	Why would you ask people ONLINE about your personal problems...seriously?? If you know that in the bible it says no sex before marriage, then follow it. It says NOTHING ELSE about it. So the things you're asking us is your own personal decision, nobody else can make it. It's not against your beliefs unless you're against it. seriously....|`|rZmJGPidaa	Marriage, long before it was a civil contract, was simply a commitment and spiritual union between two people. No legal marriage is required for you to engage in sexual activities, because in God's eyes, if you are truly committed to one another, and intend to be forever, you are already married; you are joined in the spirit, through faith and love in one another.    Don't worry so much. God will take care you you both. Let him guide your relationship.|`|3mMraMaGaa	i don't know...but remember one thing always leads to another|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Don't put yourself into any position that could get you into trouble.  And you know exactly what I'm talking about.  Alone in a bedroom, alone in a place where it could get carried away, etc.  Don't do it.    I can't believe some of these answers.  If you desire to follow God, which I take from your post that you do, of course you'll want to save yourselves for marriage.  The best advice is, don't put yourself in a place where compromsing could be easily done.
AA11188574	*** it-2 pp. 244-245 Lie ***    The opposite of truth. Lying generally involves saying something false to a person who is entitled to know the truth and doing so with the intent to deceive or to injure him or another person. A lie need not always be verbal. It can also be expressed in action, that is, a person may be living a lie. The Hebrew verb that conveys the idea of speaking that which is untrue is ka?zav. (Pr 14:5) Another Hebrew verb sha?qar means deal or act falsely, and the noun form is rendered lie; deception; falsehood. (Le 19:11; Ps 44:17; Le 19:12; Ps 33:17; Isa 57:4) Hebrew shaw, at times rendered untruth; falsehood, basically refers to something worthless, vain, valueless. (Ps 12:2; De 5:20; Ps 60:11; 89:47; Zec 10:2) The Hebrew verb ka?chash (deceive) evidently has the basic meaning prove disappointing. (Le 19:11; Ho 9:2) The Greek term pseudos and related words have to do with lying and falsehood.        While malicious lying is definitely condemned in the Bible, this does not mean that a person is under obligation to divulge truthful information to people who are not entitled to it. Jesus Christ counseled: Do not give what is holy to dogs, neither throw your pearls before swine, that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip you open. (Mt 7:6) That is why Jesus on certain occasions refrained from giving full information or direct answers to certain questions when doing so could have brought unnecessary harm. (Mt 15:1-6; 21:23-27; Joh 7:3-10) Evidently the course of Abraham, Isaac, Rahab, and Elisha in misdirecting or in withholding full facts from nonworshipers of Jehovah must be viewed in the same light.Ge 12:10-19; chap 20; 26:1-10; Jos 2:1-6; Jas 2:25; 2Ki 6:11-23.    The scenario you mentioned would fall into the category of people who do not have a right to know.|`|32bZ0JEDaa	all sins are equal|`|JDZdPo21aa	All sins are equal.

Those 2 are equally bad.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Are we talking about the ten commandments here?    Commandment 9 :    Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.    That's a very different thing from lieing.    It's very specific.   It says we must not say anything false about someone else.    I certainly don't consider lieing as bad a sin as murder.   I would willing lie to save someone's life.|`|AA10032498	The sin to WILLING (Totally, freely, without coercion) move away from God is equal.    Your story has manipulation to it.  Murder is the same as a lie ... and in many cases a lie will cause murder.  We have current events with people who where lied to about the performance of their portfolio by a scammer and killed themselves because of this lie; hence murder.    Now, sin takes practice ... and when you lie it could be a small lie, white lie, ect-ect-ect ... but with repeated practice it becomes a habit, then vice, then way of life.    Even serial murders start off small.  They typically start with insects (tearing fly's wings off), then animals, then humans, then repeating the sin in a form of habit, vice, then it becomes a game to get caught.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	It would be the consequences of the sin.|`|iou7nV3Kaa	You got it. ;)|`|gb4PA1igaa	Note that in Exodus 1:15-21 the midwives lied to Pharaoh since he asked them to kill the Hebrew children if they were boys.

It doesn't matter who becomes president, there will always be someone who doesn't like them.    Besides America was not founded on faith, but it was founded on quite a bit of negativity! it was founded on lies such as 'all men are created equal' (the white ones anyway!) and 'the right to a pursuit of happiness' unless you were gay!

According to the bible if any human did that he would be doomed!      And actually, if you think about it, Lucifer is a God in his own right! He has his own kingdom full of souls and he's the boss.  He comes to Earth and influences humans to do his bidding.  Sounds like God to me!     So yea, it's all so very silly.  Besides, there's no proof at all that heaven nor hell exist.

I always wondered about this concept.  If the Devil wants you to join him...if he wants you to move away from God.  Then why, when you do so will he poke you with a pitchfork?    But I have had it explained to me that Satan doesn't plan to torture you.  You, along with Satan will be cast down to hell and you will suffer accordingly together.  Satan does not have dominion in Hell, he is just another resident.    There are many other reasons to realize that the concept of heaven and hell is b.s.|`|AA12084096	In the traditional sense you are right.    The other way to look at it is why would God punish people forever for the c rimes of our short little lives.  And why would he do so in a way that he condemned his ancient people for doing (Deutoronomy 18:10-12)    You sound like a bright young man.  Take a moment to read the following scriptures.  It won't take long    Ecclesiastes 9:5,10  Romans 6:7  Romans 6:23    As happened back in Jesus day, people today teach "the commands of MEN as doctrine".  Take care not to confuse the two.|`|32bZ0JEDaa	Hell will be created  like heaven but for the devil will be for the devil that lies and tell everyone he is God and his demon follower and false prophet that lied and lead Gods people and sinners astray people that has been given chance after chance after chance to choose God as their savior over the devil if you know what free will is you got it and God didn't come down and kill us this time directly like the noah generation God loved us so much he is giving us a chance to realize how good God, and how much you should love and serve him and help you escape hell.revelation 21;8 but the fearful, and unbelieving and the abominable and the murders,whoremongers, sorcers,idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone remember sodom and gomorah be blessed and I pray God reveal his truth to you amen|`|cdjTbvPBaa	the devil doesn't punish anybody for going to hell. his job is to deceive you to go to hell. some people make a mistake thinking Satan rules hell, and he torments you when all along he just wants someone to go where hes gonna be in a while. in time (and not long at the rate this world is going) he will be thrown in hell with everybody else to be tormented. ultimately the choice of where you go is up to you. the bible says choose ye this day whom you will serve.

If they've got the dime to pay, it's all good.  But, I have to ask, how many "hungry people could they feed" with that money?  You know, the question they ask everytime a religious or sectarian group spends money on a cause and people automatically think they are not being charitable.  So, I ask you, what do we care what they spend their money on - even if it disagrees with what we think.  Let them spend it, and we can ignore the signs, and ride the busses anyway.|`|38a52321b2736bfedffcf55448d70c67aa	I think the ad was stupid and not very atheist at all, notice they said "there probably is no God" which tells me that athiests don't really want to admit there IS a God, just in case. I am a christian. Christ Follower.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	I find it quite funny that people who think they are the champions of logic are spending money on advertising that fights against something they do not believe exists. Then to top it off they give the agnostic belief instead of the atheist belief. "There probably is no God" Makes them sound real sure of themselves.
RNKSq3iEaa	Who told you that? Did you read it in our secret "Atheist Bible"?

The game of life is hard to play  I'm gonna lose it anyway  The losing card I'll someday lay  so this is all I have to say.    that suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  and I can take or leave it if I please.    The only way to win is cheat  And lay it down before I'm beat  and to another give my seat  for that's the only painless feat.    that suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  and I can take or leave it if I please.    The sword of time will pierce our skins  It doesn't hurt when it begins  But as it works its way on in  The pain grows stronger...watch it grin, but...    that suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  and I can take or leave it if I please.

Their decision to end their life was temporary insanity, and they regretted it and wanted to live. Most 911 calls to save people who attempted suicide are made by the person who tried to kill themselves. That's a sure sign they didn't really want to die.    The only circumstance under which ending one's own life is a reasonable decision is if one is dying anyway, slowly and painfully, and ending their life early won't cause them to lose anything but may spare them a lot of pain.|`|snj9zznvaa	i don't think its a sin  i think somebody need help and no one listen until in their desperation they took their own life that just very sad and i feel sorry for all of them|`|qbelhflAaa	Where the heck did you get that idea?

Of course, their suicidal intent may be due to depression or other mental or emotional illness, which could be treatable.  But I'm not the one to make that judgment call to tell them it's wrong and they shouldn't do it.

But just because you see no way out doesn't mean there isn't one. So in most cases where someone would attempt suicide I would try to stop them.    But if you're terminally ill, or have lost all the people you loved and are so old and weary you see no way of starting your life over, I think it can be a very sensible and even beautiful act in a way.|`|qGgSqvMpaa	It's a waste of your only life.     When I was a theist a couple of years ago my 15 year old cousin died. I attempted suicide because I thought I would never get over it and finally see my cousin again.

It's not okay in the sense you're thinking of, either - that is, it's not evil and sinful, but it's not something I'm in any way fine with. It's terribly, terribly sad that anyone could be unhappy enough to end their own life, and I know from firsthand experience that it is absolutely devastating for the friends and family. In my heart of hearts, I know they have a right to end their life, but I also know that if I found out someone had suicidal tendencies, I would do my utmost to stop them. The issue is so, so complex for me, but I think in the end I'd put the feelings of the people close to them ahead of their own.

Your teacher was trying to be tolerant when she mentioned all the religions so you can't really dock her on that. She wasn't trying to use it to teach, just to get the kids to stop bullying, because whether it's religious or not, those books are right. Those books are a fancy way of saying don't be a mean person to others. Kinda like karma, what goes around comes around.     I think that in schools they can teach about religion from a historical standpoint but not from a belief standpoint.|`|Op81lhjuaa	Not sure, but this is an opening to share the gospel with your teacher. the teacher sounds like they are being convicted and need someone to tell the the truth of Gods Word.

It's not like she was preaching and saying "Repent from you're bullying or God will dam you to hell!" she merely mentioned a name of a religion or two?  That's the least I've heard, b/c last year I had a science teacher who talked about God and He talked about Albert Einstein became a Creationist before he died and he ranted completely AGAINST evolutionism and laughed and said "Yeah, a seamonkey MAGICALLY turned into a goldfish which MAGICALLY turned into a bigger fish which MAGICALLY turned into a monkey which MAGICALLY turned into a human" and that kind of thing.

God gave his only Son Jesus as a sin sacrifice, so that everyone who puts his faith in Him shall be forgiven their sins and granted the free gift of everlasting life.      The qualities of morality are natural to man, who was made in the image and likeness of God.  Though man is sinful, owing to the disobedience of Adam, he is still a moral being.  After all--the forbidden fruit was the knowledge of good and evil.  The Bible suggests that this moral quality of man is part of his sin nature!      St. Paul further developed the theology of man's fallen condition with the argument that he presents in the book of Romans, which is the first and most important doctrinal book in the Bible.  In it, Paul lays out the difference between the "Law" and "grace."  Salvation, he maintains, is the free gift of God based on the merits of his Son Jesus.  It can't be obtained through the "works of the Law (ten commandments, etc.).

No lying, no gossiping, no hatefulness, no cruelty.  Right Livelihood: Make a living in an honest way, not illegally or by cheating or deceiving others. "It's just my job" is no excuse for immoral behavior.    Wisdom:  Right View: See things as they are, without bias or prejudice.  Right Intention: Do the right thing for the right reason, not just to seek reward and avoid punishment, but out of genuine compassion and care for others. Commit oneself to self-improvement.    Mental Development:  Right Effort: Always put forth effort in all one's endeavors, especially seeking enlightenment, and never be lax in moral conduct.  Right Mindfulness: Focus and concentrate on the here and now, always mindful of the task at hand.

EBGdlo35aa	A) If 26 Christian Saints would be dishonest or lie about levitating themselves, how God inspired is the Bible?    Quite obviously, the 2 are unrelated.  By analogy:  if 26 American heroes would be dishonest and lie about levitating themselves, how accurate is a U.S. history text book?  The two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other.      B) Weren't Saints considered to be "God inspired"?    Some people consider some saints to have been holy and to have had the ability to perform miracles.  That is not exactly the same as "God inspired", and is definitely different from the the inspiration of the authors of the bible.  Are you telling me that if someone somewhere believes some guy named Saint Bob can levitate, that this in some manner discredits the bible?  How so?  The only thing such a claim can possibly discredit is Saint Bob and the person who believes that Saint Bob can levitate.  Even then, they are only discredited if Saint Bob actually did NOT levitate.      C) Does anyone believe they levitated at all... at least without trickery/deception of some kind?    I'm sure that there are some people who believe that some saints levitated at one time or another.  After all, Jesus walked on water!      D) I am not referring to a Man-God or Jesus. They were human beings who were supposed to be Christians and/or inspired by God... like those who wrote the Holy Bible.    Well, "supposed to be" is accurate.  Whether they were able to perform miracles or not is a matter of faith.  However, Jesus did say this (verse 12)  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...      E) These are more than "just 26 people". They were classified by the Christian Church as "Saints".    You mean, "they were classified by A Christian church as saints".  You don't think that all Christians believe all of the doctrines held by a single Christian sect, do you?  Most Christian sects do not believe in a class of miracle-causing people known as "saints".  Most Christian sects believe that the word "saints" means "Christians".      Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|lTx8Hoheaa	So 26 people lying proves Christianity wrong.

For the reason that all kinds of animals that don't typically breed actually can.  Like Ligers - a mix of Lions and Tigers, or Zorses - Zebras and Horses.

I think this comes more from a lack of understanding about what the Catholic Church (rather than a few individual Catholics) really teaches.    From what I have learned in speaking to many Catholics, including priests,  Catholics and Fundamentalists pretty much agree on the five fundamental doctrines of Christianity. All of the other differences are really minor.    This is not to say that I believe that this means that all Catholics are going to Heaven any more than it means that all Baptists are going to Heaven. Christ knows our hearts and He knows who the faithful ones are within any denomination. It is for Him to decide who is going to Heaven or not, not for us.    He tells us to be careful in judging others, as we will be judged by the same standard that we use.      *edit* I really wish that those who would disagree with Catholic doctrine would first learn about it from what the Catholic Church's position really is, rather than getting their information on Catholicism from some dipstick website or a Jack Chick comic book.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I can only speak for myself and I can tell you I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Of course they do.  A whole lot of Protestants (I would also venture to say most of us) believe the very same thing about all Protestant sects other than their own.  That's WHY we have different sects.  Didn't you know?      5) Shouldn't these people write their own holy book, at this point?    Umm...let me run it down for you.    a) the oldest parts of the bible were written or relayed orally by the Hebrews  b) later parts of the bible were written or relayed orally by the Jews, who were in fact Hebrews  c) Christianity was begun by a Jew named Jesus.  Christianity is, in essence, an offshoot of Judaism.  d) the Christian section of the bible was, if not entirely, almost entirely written by Jews who had become Christians.    So, the bible *is* the book of the Christians, just as the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) is the bible of the Jews, just as the Torah is the Law of Moses, etc. etc.  Each group incorporates - quite naturally - the beliefs of their ancestors into their own.      Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|AA10032498	The Bible is God's word and it is good to listen to God.  Problems occur when there is no leadership, tradition, and unity in this.

All the religions are man made and so are the books they spout off as The Holy Word Of God. Any true God that was as stupid as the human race is would surely give a universal message that any and all could understand not things that would require you to be born in a certain part of the world so you would be lucky enough to be exposed to the"Truth".  LOL All LIEs All three religions the 3 Big Lies. Besides they all have already made up their own Bible. What A JOKE   EVERYONE SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO KEEP SPOUTING THESE LIES!

GPznIhzMaa	It really depends on what you did... If it was something that could have endangered her job and/or the company, then she had the right to tell. But if you made a minor mistake and you corrected it, that's a different story.|`|EmalyNv5aa	It depends on what you did.  The co-manager's first priority at work is managing not making sure she keeps your trust.  If you did something wrong you should have told your boss.  This might have prevented you demotion/firing and also saved you from feeling betrayed.|`|CCf6Y7DIaa	she was your manager; she was doing her job. business is business. the only trust that was betrayed was the company's when you did wrong. never, EVER bring personal issues into the workplace or take workplace issues personally; it never reflects well in any light.    if you don't act professional, you shouldn't cry around that other people will fault you for it; that is your job, no matter your industry or career path.       as some general advice, when you aren't professional, people notice -and when you are professional, people notice that as well. if the former is true but the latter is not, continue working hard but search equally hard to find a new employer.     there are actually a few cases where some very hard working people in very low positions got noticed by higher ups and eventually attained much higher positions. -kent murphy is one example, being the second person i know of who started as a mere janitor in the company where he worked and ultimately became the ceo. our meritocracy rewards noticeable effort. always work hard, always look for better opportunities, always expand your horizons and never do what you shouldn't.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Apologies/taking-it-back doesn't really show that you care.  It's just "sorry ... blah blah blah"  If that ever happens again you might want to talk it out and show some remorse, that is, if you care.  Like sit down and have a chat with whoever your crappy decision affected... like your boss, co-manager, or whoever you screwed over.    And your co-manager didn't "betray your trust," unless you talked about it with her and she said she wouldn't tell.  If she thought your decision was really stupid, then I'm not surprised she told your boss.  It doesn't matter that you "took it back."  You are responsible for everything you do.|`|nLScNIekaa	yeah what a ***** what did you do though>?|`|Ga11Abmzaa	well, first of all your shouldnt have done what you did, If your co-worker said she wouldnt tell, but she did then she did betray your trust by being a hypocrite.

AA10556726	A mixture of both with a few other things thrown in.  Belief encourages subjective evaluation in the areas of belief.  This coupled with lack of information tends to prevent objective conclusions.|`|ZzdurUuLaa	this is wishful thinking.    I know for a fact that there is NO such thing as God.   God is made up. If God made everything, what made God?  And what made the thing that made god and so on and so forth!    If God is figured to be Jesus, how come Jesus isn't the first human being in earth? And how come Jesus was Jewish??     Also, how can God be a human figure? If he didn't think about humans before he had made earth, how can he be human?    If God is real, how come no one's prayers come true?     I know why people think there is a God, (or superhuman)    It's because a long time ago, a very smart being figured out when the river will flood and when the humans should farm and get crops and when to harvest, so they thought of him as a God.

Well, sadly, people have not evolved that much over the past few thousand years, and we still have millions, or billions, of people who like to believe in these little fairy tales to help them get through the harsh realities of existence.  Like little children who refuse to relinquish their 'safety blankets' they cling to their ridiculous religious beliefs in the face of mountains of evidence to the contrary.  Let them be, friend.  They will come around sooner or later.  Until then, unfortunately, they will kill thousands of each other in religious wars such as we see in Gaza and Iraq.

Addendum: thycid - I'm glad to see some people still study Hicksian philosophy. |`|423dac9ccdf068c5650bc0ec9c26ec65aa	It is neither. It is a man made explanation to the 'unknown'. God exists within us all. All matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death, life is only a dream, we're an imagination of ourselves.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	It is neither wishful thinking or lack of evidence.  God is here and makes Himself known to many.|`|1uADdd4Raa	I am an atheist and it is my belief that there is no god. I believe that ''God'' was used to explain something unknown - that being what happens after you die. Religion is now being exploited- for money and an excuse for otherwise unacceptable behavior.(ie suicide bombers). As innocent as the fable began it has now effectively become and opiate of the masses.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	The existence of God is a highly personal question.   Whether you believe that there is an old man sitting on the edge of a cloud, waving a huge rod and condemning all those who wish to eat pork - that's one way to look at it.   a completely other way is to state that God is, in fact, a huge pile of spaghetti.     And then you can always think that God lies in everything in the universe, in every tree, animal and bird.     The existence of one humanoid figure is nothing more than banal - God is supposed to be the external force either guiding or controlling us (or merely there for spiritual support). There is no ubiquitous way to look at it, for God is different for everyone of us.     Historical lack of evidence? To prove something, you must have a hypothesis which in this case does not exist (first you should decide which God is the true God, which is inane in its essence).     My solely personal opinion being that God is collective consciousness, higher plane of existence, the x-factor we can not solve.   Not a bearded man.|`|3YfYWpAsaa	Well, what about the historical accounts of many people, in AND out of the bible, who saw Jesus walk the earth, die, and rise from the dead and ascend into heaven?    What about moses and abram (later abraham), who saw God appear to them?    What about the fact that for God TO NOT exist, DNA, RNA and proteins would have all had to form simultaneously and then bond into life- the chance of which EVER happening ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE is 1 in a trillion trillion trillion??    ======================    Sure, the debate over God is a heated one, and nobody knows for sure.  And YES it seems that there is only a small chance he exists. BUT, when you consider that its ALSO a small chance for God to NOT exist- because "the perfect planet in the perfect place who happens to get life" is such an infinitesimally small number- you start to realize this:    Both natural creation and supernatural creation seem equally implausible; therefore, they are on equal footing; 50-50; it could go either way.    I am a person of faith, obviously; and I as a thinking man know that there IS a chance God doesn't exist, just as there is a chance he does.    ===========    This IS, IN FACT, the ONLY question that I- the all-knowing wrestler- do not know!    But I DO KNOW THIS: I WOULD RATHER LIVE LIKE GOD EXISTED AND FIND OUT HE DOESN'T, AND SIMPLY DIE IN THE GROUND, HAVING LIVED A GOOD LIFE PRAISING HIM ONCE IN AWHILE..... THAN TO LIVE MY LIFE LIKE GOD DOESN'T EXIST, FIND OUT HE DOES, AND BE TORTURED AND INCINERATED IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY!|`|8T2R2bqyaa	You can't prove he's not real|`|nzHtrczVaa	Jesus said "A wicked generation asks for a miraculour sign and none will be given.

RA7WIdNIaa	Firstly slander refers to a false SPOKEN statement which damages a person's character.  You are thinking of LIBEL.    Secondly a statement can only be legally considered as slanderous or libelous if what is said or written is untrue.      If you choose to put up posters you must be absolutely certain you have the right man because if you made a mistake with his identity you might ruin an innocent man's life.

But I did tell one of his family members and she believed me because he molested her. Anyway, confront him if you can and stand your ground. Pray for him and move on.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Molest the individual back. Hire a private detective to check the individuals back ground.

I know you don't want to do that, but I don't know what to say.    If you go around there acting like you want to hurt him you could end up hurt yourself or worse.  Then where would your kids be?    You could end up getting sued for slander if you put up flyers.|`|14f43f349bb66eb9fca9c31edef61771aa	well since proof of molestation maybe hard to obtain since it happen so long ago. but I'm really not sure what to do by maybe he's already on the child molester register.

The Bible Students still exist (the original followers of Russell) and there's another group called the Christodelphians which are very similar. I think the big difference is that these groups don't have the governing body and they still accept 1874 as the date of Christ's presence.|`|FK3lCrUaaa	None now, and none ever. No matter what they claim, the first century Christians would have rejected them for their false teachings.|`|mrMkKFqNaa	Pharisees (1st century Jewish religious leaders).  As Jesus said, their worship is in vain because they teach commands of men as doctrines.    Just like the Pharisees, the JWs love to make up rules that are not mentioned in the Bible.  But that's par for the course with man-made religious organizations.    Also, both are very hierarchical in structure.  Rank and file JWs follow every word of their clergy (Governing Body) as if it were in the Bible.    I find it patently absurd for JWs to assert that they have no clergy.  JWs have several layers of clergy.  It works like this:    Governing Body-->Branch Committee-->Zone Overseer-->District Overseer--> Circuit Overseer-->City Overseer (if in urban area with multiple congregations)-->Elders-->rank-and-file JWs    And, the first 5 layers (Governing Body, Branch Committee, and Zone/Circuit/District Overseers) are all PAID!  So, JWs have PAID CLERGY, just like other churches!  They're not paid very much money, but they're still paid and all of their living expenses are covered.    This is unlike 1st Century evangelizers like the Apostle Paul who worked for a living (making tents).|`|XbuvO2DLaa	The only things I can think of are:  1) First Century Christians.  No others, currently.    Islam believes in and worships only One God.  i.e. no trinity.    LDS does the preaching / missionary work.   But, only the men and only for 2 years.  And they don't accept the trinity quite like the rest of Christendom.  They don't believe in the trinity according to their website.  But, in reading a little bit, you soon notice that when they refer to the Holy Spirit, they say / it says "he."    Not one; comes close.  Amos 3:7|`|b5PjQzEYaa	Catholics|`|FZM15NXtaa	In modern times, probably the remaining Bible Students groups, although they are stuck in a time warp.  They have not kept up with present truth, and are not really set up to fulfill Jesus' great commission to preach the Good News in all the world.    Though they have the basics of the Truth, they are not doing much with it, being rather fragmented and insular at present, and probably numbering only a few thousand members.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	My opinion - Islam.  Neither believes in the God of mainstream Christianity. Both believe in the virtues of doing things for God/Allah in order to please Him.  Both have a disdain for those outside of their own faith.

Most like to celebrate or have remembrance holidays. I guess you have a resemblance to Christianity in there with the whole if you don't believe you won't be saved by Jesus.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	I found no break-away groups in the wikipedia article. Their views are very unique in some instances and the unique views are not shared by other groups.    Aside from proselyting activities (which is common for "Mormons"), they preach a unique Gospel, and claim that proper interpretation can only come through the President of the Watchtower group. They deny that their president is a prophet of God.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Only 1st century Christians.

But not much like modern Jews and certainly we have very little in common with any of the other groups who call themselves Christian today.    We are not like the Mormons at all.  Other than our door to door ministry that is.  Of course the Mormons don't come to your door trying to teach you the Bible like we do, they want to know if you would like to know more about the "book of Mormon" or the "Mormon church".    We are not like the Baptists although we do beleive as they do in adult full water immersion when being baptized    We are nothing like Catholics.  I can't think of a single thing that the Catholics do that is at all similar to us except maybe the passing of the bread and wine.  Of course they do this every week and we do it once a year as we believe Jesus intended since he started that particular custom on the day of Passover which was also celebrated once a year.  And they believe that the bread and wine actually becomes the flesh and blood of Jesus which idea we find totally abhorrent since that would make us cannibals and drinkers of human blood!    We are not much like the 7th Day Adventists, and yet some of their ideas in the past were similar to some of ours.  Not much so now.    There are some "non-denominational" Christian faiths who are like us in that they don't celebrate the holidays either.  I once spoke to a woman who told me she didn't celebrate Christmas and when I asked her why she said her father felt is was a pagan celebration and he was part of a non-denominational Christian faith (of his own invention it sounded like).    Like Jesus and the apostles we preach the good news of the Kingdom.  Like them we meet in small groups and have no clergy/laity distinctions but are all "brothers".  Like them we have traveling overseers who go to strengthen the various congregations.  Like them we practice full immersion baptism  Like them we celebrate the Lord's evening meal once a year.  Like them we quote from the Hebrew scriptures as well as the Greek scriptures.  Like them we look forward to and "keep awake" expecting our Lord Jesus to bring the kingdom that he has promised us.    Many other similarities.  too many to go into.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	All the rest of the Cults.|`|Ot5maIapaa	Wow, the people who say Mormons are either stupid, are dont bother to research.

Satan/the Devil/the Serpent cannot have a body, and therefore, cannot be killed, silly.  that's what makes him so angry, and so determined to steal our souls to himself - misery loves company.

And at the end, we prayed and I prayed (my exact words) "I pray the fire will burn like crazy" and so we went to our friend's house to eat, and hang out, and before we left back home (another city/town), we went and saw the fire. And it had been 8hrs, and the fire was still burning, like crazy.    And then, also, on Christmas day, it had been snowing in Corpus Christi, TX, so we were amazed, but we lived in Seadrift (small town, same as the last story) and so we were driving back to Seadrift and there was a bridge, and a deisel was on the other lane and so we were just driving, and my little brother wasn't in his seatbelt, and he was laying there sleeping, and so then we drove, across a piece of ice, and we started spinning (my mom had been on cruise control, which made it spin) and we were just holding on and screaming while the car spun around like an out of control roller coaster. And then when it stopped spinning, we got out and checked all around the car and there wasn't a dent or a scratch or ANYTHING. We could've easily fell over the bridge. And then the diesel driver just sat there in astonishment, so my mom went and told him all of us were okay, and then when my mom got back my little brother woke up and asked what happened. And we took it off cruise control and drove home w/our Christmas miracle.    There's a ton more and I can e-mail them to you, but that's my personal proof. (:|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	I am Agnostic, no religion. I think there are patterns in life that can not simply be explained or explained away by our current ideologies, religions, philosophies etc... What is clear to me is that we are something we simply do not understand. None of the current religions in the world have any direct visible link to God, they are political action committees that assume their respective groups have some particular favor that the others do not have with God. It just seems odd to me that it is through violence and oppression that any have established themselves. There are many good people in many religions. That is not an apology on my part, because what I mean is I can see that but many of them do not see it for themselves.

kD4BBKARaa	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28.      John 14:23 - Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.       Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. - Psalm 34:14.      1 Peter 4:8 - Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.       No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. - John 6:44.      Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. - Philippians 4:8.      But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. - Isaiah 40:31.      And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.- 1 Samuel 14:6.    Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. - Psalm 23:5.      2 Timothy 1:9 - Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,|`|it1RVWagaa	1: John 3:16  Basically the Bible in a nutshell.

Some are healers, others correct our magics when they are not properly formed. If a house needed mild ghost busting, a cat who is good at that sort of thing could do it. But not a major infestation.

They have a "cute" gene that keeps us from killing them when they stick up their snooty noses at us. The cute thing is in inverse proportion to their mischief.

bb06GQ5Paa	I have a gay aunt and uncle and several cousins.  (I think that gene runs through our family, I really do)  We all kind of figured they were gay (You can tell early on a lot of times.) but we weren't going to say anything to them because they were still uneasy with it themselves.  When they finally came out, they found that we still loved them and though it was something to get used to at first, that's still my aunt, my uncle or my cousins.  And when anyone says something bad about them being gay, baby, you got the whole family ready to burn the city down!      So, I think my family would definitely relate to that story.  It's so sad what gay folks have to go through.  What you do in your bedroom is your business and I shouldn't treat you differently because of it.

What it should perhaps say is that 'Atheists wish there wasn't a God then they could relax and not fear Him.' Tough for them isn't it?|`|3arJsZ91aa	I still haven't seen any.  Mind you, I would take as much notice of the ads as I do most others - virtually none!|`|JpgLxU1Laa	i don't the word probably on them... more like agnostic advos...|`|yBXLgHbmaa	I think everybody should stop worrying and complaining.

Many try to teach, but they prefer Darwin.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	Psa 53:1  To the Chief Musician on Mahalath. A contemplation. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They acted corruptly, and have worked out abominable wickedness; there is not one doing good.   Psa 53:2  God looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind to see if any was discerning, who was seeking God.   Psa 53:3  Every one has turned away; they have altogether become filthy; not one is doing good, no, not even one.   Psa 53:4  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? They eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called on God.       By the law of averages, denying the existence of a single entity carrys only a 50/50 chance, and this is not enough to convince me of their argument with eternity at stake.  Also, the advertisement suggests that those who believe in God are incapable of enjoying themselves, which in the consensus of myself and my Christian friends is ludicrous as we have a right laugh !    It's therefore my opinion that "the fool has wasted his money..."|`|qbelhflAaa	They're atheists being lame, that's what they are.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	I think they are double-deckers.

usltkMnwaa	I consider Buddhism more a a philosophy than a religion. They worship not "God", and are open to various doctrines.     Basically, buddhism is: "we are unhappy because of our desires for things are not or do not have. Rid yourself of desires".     so much truth to that.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	For introductory Buddhist topics, you can read 'China Falun Gong', available on the web.  Guided meditation demonstration video, meditation music, and books about Falun Gong are free to download from the URL listed below. If you need any help, contact a local practitioner in your area for free instructions.    Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.    Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China.

Buddhist believe that life is essentially suffering, and that once this is acknowledged one can be happy. Buddhist believe that reality is an illusion, and that we are slaves to our senses. Buddhist believe in reincarnation, due to their belief that we are energy. Many of today scientific theories support Buddhism. Quantum mechanics for example. Do a little research and you will find it very interesting.|`|GqQFu9Qpaa	Buddhism is one of the world's major spiritual systems.    Just like Christianity there are many forms and schools.    The two things that they all agree upon are the three jewels and the four noble truths.        The three jewels are:      The Buddha (The Teacher)                                          The Dharma (The Teachings)    The Sangha   (The community of followers)        The Four Noble Truths Are:    That in life one is subject at times to suffering.    That desire or mistaken views of reality lead to suffering.    That suffering can be overcome.    The teaching that lead to the end of suffering, which is called the eightfold path.      I am a Mahayana Buddhist and it is the aim of my life to help all human beings overcome suffering and to achieve spiritual prosperity.    This is done through the process of understanding the preciousness of human life; being open to all people all the time without the desire to change or fix them; and fostering compassion in difficult times.    To achieve this Buddhists engage in the process of meditation to stabilize their minds and open their hearts to be of benefit to the people around them as situations arise in day to day life.    Buddhism is a non-theistic religion.    We understand that there are people who believe in God, and that there are people that don't.  Regardless of your metaphysical view, the Buddhist teachings can be used to add joy, wisdom, compassion, and understanding to any human being without exception.    It is also the view of Buddhism that people who have different religious beliefs are no more or less "right" then people who follow the Buddhist path.  Wisdom, it is taught, is clearly too vast to be comprehended conceptualy by the human mind.    I hope this answered some of your questions.

gD0zEnFTaa	Although the scriptures in Genesis 19:30-36 doesn't mention the daughters of Lot being damned for having intercourse with their father, that doesn't mean their actions were right.  The Law of God had not yet been given to the Israelites, the law was given centuries later when the Israelites were delivered from slavery in Egypt.  "The Lord gave the following regulations.  Do not have sexual intercourse with any of your relatives." (Leviticus 18:6).  The Moabites and Ammonites were descended from Lot's daughters. (Genesis 19:37-38).  Both these nations became enemies of the Israelites and were excluded from becoming part of God's people.

You only run into problems when you have several generations of brother/sister, mother/son, father/daughter pairings, which apparently wasn't the case after the Flood.   Even at Creation, there was only one generation of brother/sister pairings, and everything after that was just cousins or distant cousins.|`|NFK3A68oaa	If you look up "Race" in any encyclopedia, you will find that we are all inbred, anyway--human races, for example, are so identical genetically that they could not have evolved separately.

In any event, most break them down as:    Moral, civil, ceremonial, sacrificial.  Sacrificial laws are a subset of ceremonial.    Technically, there is no such thing as a "moral" law. Rather, some laws deal with morality.  Only a person can be moral or immoral/amoral.    Some churches ( I use the term loosely) use these categories as a means of justifying keeping some of the old covenant while rejecting other pars of the old covenant.  If there is a point of law that is not "moral" but they want to have their members abide by it, they redefine such points of law as being morally based, which is one of the classic methods employed by deceivers.    For example, the SDA declares and insists the sabbath is a moral law simply because of its position and relation to the ten commandments; the core of the old covenant.  But if we define a moral law as being a law where there is never an excuse to violate it, then the sabbath cannot be a moral law.  There is never an excuse for murdering another, or committing adultery, but there are many examples in Scripture where the sabbath command is set aside for the sake of human need and necessity.    This is all a moot point though when you understand that the old covenant was only required of anc. Israel, and that the old covenant came to an end by the death of the party of the first part, God in the personage of Jesus Christ who was the God of the old covenant.  This is explained by Paul in Romans 7.          .|`|iX0CoNkXaa	ceremonial    The feasts and so on|`|APvWqIoXaa	blasphemal|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Obedience|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	Levitical, Mosaic, and...?

OpkBvRIaaa	The Catholic Church is one of the few organizations that Truly does hate the sin love the sinner. It condemns homosexual sex but acknowledges homosexuality.    Most homophobes are literalist Protestants in Texas and Alabama. It is not Catholic theology to believe "God hates F*gs" because God doesn't hate. The problem is most people do not go by real theology but still claim to represent the Church|`|VUK77SrXaa	Because prejudice isn't rational.  Because the fundamental teachings of the Catholic church were written by fallible men, just as the bible was.  This leads to many contradictions and shows the prejudice of those authors.  It is also, because those flawed documents are read and interpreted by flawed and prejudiced men...  Do we see a pattern here?

Unitarian Universalism is also compatible with an atheist worldview.    Scientology, as I understand it, includes reference to several beings with deity-level supernatural abilities, such as Xenu - and therefore, is not compatible with atheism.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	I wouldn't consider atheism a religion.

But God has told us that there is coming a day when He will judge all and then separate Good from Evil forevermore.  We have our entire lifetime, no matter how long or short that may be, to turn to God and commit ourselves to doing as He commands or ignoring Him and pleasing ourselves instead.  At judgment day, God will see those who desire to be with Him by their life's actions and grant their wishes.  God will also see someone who could care less for God and honor their lifelong desire.  How could He justly force them to be with Him when they have proven they could care less for His company?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	human skin burns up in cremation right??? so this makes no sense...    hell is graves....we all will die in time|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	their imaginary friends can say whatever he wants.

It is even written that Christ died, was buried, descended into hell itself and then rose again to be seated at the right hand of the Father.       Moreove, if God is the God of the universe and creator, it seems to me that all things are possible. If he can raise Lazarus from the grave, Enoch, and Elijah, then how much more will he do for those whom He loves.  He has a sense of humor but that is just sublime compared to what He can do if you give Him a chance even in death.      The funnny thing is that we deserve death but Christ intercedes for us.  His whole life purpose is so that no one under the sun is lost to eternal hell.  The prophesy in Revelations, shows Him victorious, in all that were chosen to be apart of His kingdom, all that were chosen would not be lost.  Perhaps, I really should not clump all of humanity into the chosen people of God or all of humanity in to those who are called by God.  But sooner or later, we will all be judged by Christ and in this judgement whether we are dead or alive at the time, Christ is to act as a lawyer on our behalf in front of God the Father and say "this ones mines" or not.      What makes this funny to me is that I had an Atheist friend and then when she was going through a hard time, she told me, admitted to me that she prayed to God.  Before that she was worried about having a friend like me because one of her friends got saved and then asked her if she could wash her feet.  She never asked questions or even wanted to be near that person again.  Then it just so happens that she told me, almost to say please do not tell me you are going to wash my feet.  I recalled what that meant.  It was the supposed a time Christ spent with His disciples, and he knelt down to wash their feet one by one.  But Peter was so mad, I mean when Christ knelt down, Peter was like what are you doing Master.   I cannot allow you to wash my feet like some servant.  But Christ was like if I do not wash you then how can you belong to me.  Then Peter said, please wash my hands and my face too.  Christ lives to serve humanity so that we can truly belong to him.  So that salvation can be obtainable.  For non-believers, they are just people who are like Peter before he knew who Christ was and is and shall be.|`|FOZGMadaaa	God is the one that has it right.     Satan is a father of lies.And here is the sick joke. He has become and Atheist father. He speaks in your spirit and you believe God does not exist. So why seek him. Now who has the sick sense of humor when a person goes to hell only to find.    Christianity was orchestrated by God. So it is in heaven so it is in the earth.     So Satan is a little g god that pulled this joke.So he is there burning in hell with you. His children. Cause and effects of ones choices   disobedience to the word of God. God said what would happen.     Men will burn because they want to. Why? To him the word of God is to hard to understand. John 6:60 On hearing it,many of the disciples said This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it? So they grumbled.So many are offended.    From that time to this times many people will turn back and know longer follow the word of God. And so their children will become Atheist. We all have forefathers and we follow their teachings. God still prompts us and he still shows us mercy and grace. How many chances should God give us?    So if it is a joke it is the flesh,and the flesh counts for nothing.    The word of God is spirit and it is the spirit that gives life. So if the spirit does not live in them. What is and Atheist's destiny?
CCf6Y7DIaa	just another proof of the old adage, 'never trust overemotional people' ;)    most times, people like this are just getting worked up because they like getting worked up and actually couldn't give half a rat's **** what the real truth is either way -many just aren't open enough to admit it. sometimes it takes having an opinion fit along prescribed routes; in this case, the opinion is that there is a powerful cult of personality surrounding obama (which there is). of course, calling him a king is a dire stretch.    EDIT: such is also a case of wrongfully assuming 'the right to free speech' means 'the right to rattle off any irresponsible thought that occurs in one's head without any deliberation, personal responsibility, restraint or shame.' i blame our poor educational system, which has demoted the priority of critical thinking in favor of non-educational tests and hearing that theology has a place in a science classroom.|`|62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	Me, it's funny how most of you Yanks get bothered, rant and make a big deal over absolutely nothing.

Which just goes to show that Christianity is still JUST a religion to some.  I mean seriously, is there any real reason that church services are supposed to be a mandatory ritual?    EDIT: Let me bring a little more clarity.    1. Canceling a service is not canceling "Church" as We the body of Christ ARE the church.    2. Watching the superbowl instead of attending a service does not mean that your priorities are football over God, just that you do not believe that organized religion is God.    3. If the Church is supposed to be about fellowship, then I'm certainly gonna get more fellowship watching football with friends than I would pretending everything in my life is ok around a bunch of people who don't talk about their lives either.|`|i48kxrbaaa	hahaha!!! MY church too!

If it was a big game f football (what you call "soccer") we would video it and watch it together after.

The atmosphere had a greater concentration of oxygen, so that aided in longer lives. After all the years the earth has been around, with all the pollution and such, we just can't live that long anymore.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Those were only the post-Flood ages. Before the Flood, people could live up to 900 YO.  How? For one thing, the atmosphere was different. There used to be a canopy of water or ice above the atmosphere (a 7th layer) that kept out the damaging rays of the sun (the  1 cause of aging today), increased air pressure and created a warm climate from pole to pole. The increased air pressure did two things - one, it allowed humans, plants and animals to grow to enormous sizes. The fossil record shows giant reptiles (dinosaurs), giant mammals, giant insects (2-ft long grasshoppers) and giant humans (9-12 feet tall). And secondly, the increased air pressure also increased the amount of oxygen in the tissue of humans, allowing them to heal quickly from any injuries.   Also, the food sources were better and healthier. Adam and Eve ate a purely vegetarian diet.   So basically, all the factors that cause us to age prematurely today were not existent before the Flood, which allowed the human body to live for several hundred years.   The water canopy came down during the Flood (this was part of the Floodwater), allowing the sun's rays to beat down on us and damaging our bodies. The lush plant life from before was gone. God authorized eating meat to make up for the lack of fruits and vegetables, which also lowered our lifespans. The oxygen content of the atmosphere dropped, and we couldn't heal as quickly anymore. Lifespans dropped down to 400, then 300, then 200, and today, few people make it to 100.   The Hunza tribe of Afghanistan has the record for the oldest living humans. When they were discovered, the average lifespan was 160 years, because of their diet and lifestyle. Then they were introduced to Western food, and their lifespans dropped.|`|nJatWOhsaa	After Noah's flood God said he would limit the human lifespan to 120.

Many people have speculated that after the flood, conditions in the world changed such that longevity mentioned in the bible ceased to occur without Divine Intervention (i.e. St. Simeon who held Christ as a baby who Church Tradition teaches lived 300 years awaiting the Messiah).    Luke 2:25-34 (King James Version)   25And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.      26And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.      27And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,      28Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,      29Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:      30For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,      31Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;      32A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.      33And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.      34And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
jF0l4ghraa	I wish there was a way to combat the trend.  Girls are doing all these promiscuous acts for the attention.  What they don't realize is that they're attracting attention from the wrong kind of guys.  Guys who don't hold a door for a lady, who often have one-night stands, who cheat, who lie.  These are not gentlemen they attract.  Real gentlemen are not impressed by sexual deviancy.    And this kind of behavior hits the boys just as hard.  They're taught to mistreat women and do whatever it takes to get sexual relief from them.  It's disgusting.  And this only gets worse in college.  College can be one of the sleaziest places in the world.  Underage drinking mixed with being away for the first time can have horrible consequences.  You have to instill self-respect into your child at a young age.  Teach them about sexual deviancy and its consequences.  Most of all, give them a role-model, which is hard to find in this day of drugs and artists being synonymous.    It takes boys and girls with strong spirits to swim against this trend.  It takes a lot of self-respect.  It's worth it.|`|GZXDHVkXaa	tobe_new@yahoo.com|`|IqqaA2wIaa	ftake your daughter to a TRinity church with you at least once a month or more....set a good example....speak to her about right and wrong....read the Bible and help her to learn it too....OOO
EmOnt7FIaa	This is my post from another topic.      Skin tone is not an indicator of race if it was than Asians and some Hispanics would be classified as white.  Race is based off of genetic makeup, not what you and your friends may think he looks like he has 50% white ancestry and 50% black ancestry, and I don't care what he calls himself, he is mixed.    Calling yourself a certain race doesn't magically change your race. If Lil Wayne started calling himself Japanese, is he Japanese?|`|XimcTAFpaa	To be honest physical.

cNniG2L0aa	"they believe in absolute morality"  I doubt that's true; most atheists KNOW that Morality, like Truth, Beauty and Justice, is in the eyes of the beholder.    Many men of the muzzle faith see no problems with slaughtering a daughter if she doesn't wear a veil outside the home.    MY moral standards say that's wrong.  You?    There was NO commandment in bibel against Rape, Slavery or Child Molestation BUT I don't do them.  You?  ~|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Atheists don't have a collective consciousness, everybody has their own beliefs. The only thing we have in common is a lack of belief in a god or gods.  Basic morals - like don't murder, don't steal people's stuff - are common to every human society and culture on the planet, even animals have moral codes, from ants to elephants. More complex morals, however, are relative.    I suppose those who believe in absolute morality would consider that to be in all things act to cause the least harm to others.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Well think a second. If Conscience is from somewhere else then you aren't an atheist. And if it is from you it isn't absolute. In fact it isn't anything you can put your finger on. When you hear, Don't do this it is gravely wrong -- are you getting a message from yourself. And who do you pay to if you go against you.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	Morality comes from the fact that we as a social species can't be a very effective or productive group if we hurt one another.  True morals are about not hurting others physically or mentally.|`|zkETPA8waa	I believe the only thing that is absolute about our morality is that it is a core part of our society and without it, our current society could not exist at all. It would crumble. So while it's not objective and coming from some outside source, it's absolute in the sense that it's fundamental to how we as humans interact with each other and to prevent a complete breakdown of everything in our lives.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	logically absolutes must exist:    if there are only relatives, then that, itself, is an absolute... thus absolutes exist -- no "god" required    that said, not much is absolute... the best statement is half on the "golden rule"... "do not do to others what is hateful to you"    the xian version of "do to others what you want done to you" doesn't work, because that becomes relative in the actions required; the negative statement remains absolute because it never requires an action.|`|1d40jvLnaa	I believe in the evolution of intelligence...|`|84nXWNT3aa	Don't be an asshole.

For myself and others.|`|yTYWTKSJaa	Everyone's morality is subjective . . . as is evident throughout history.  Anyone who says their morality is absolute is ridiculous.  Morality is shaped primarily by society . . . influenced at first through instinct, refined through social interaction and socio-evolution.    So no, morality is not objective.  It's subjective.  We, as a SOCIETY, determine the "objective" morals.  Like murder.|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	i believe in true morals|`|aEdkaXmtaa	that doesn't make sense to me|`|O7SshRl6aa	There is only one thing that makes an Atheist and Atheist:  no belief in a god or gods.  Atheists, as a group, probably hold every belief imaginable.  Some believe in evolution, some don't some are liberals, some are not, etc.  Their sources of morality are likely highly varied and cannot be nailed down in a quick answer.|`|AA12203324	Maybe they're thinking of abstract morals like, anything that severely disrupts social stability with no social benefit is wrong, or, harming one segment of a culture to benefit another segment for purposes other than compensation is wrong.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	I think that most all of them truly believe in an absolute morality.  They say that morality comes from society (including parents) and/or some feelings of conscience/common sense/empathy.  But everyone was raised in at least a somewhat different society and everyone is unique in what feelings they have.  If moralityh comes from society and feelings, it will be different for everyone.      If the atheist is robbed, he or she will say the robber is immoral but the robber was raised in a different society with different feelings.  So I think the atheist operates as if morality is universal yet intellectually has to deny it in order to remain an atheist.|`|BNHocZaiaa	I don't believe in absolute morality.

I know a bunch of you will not agree with me. But the thing is Israel has put a blockade preventing supplies, aids, and medical supplies from getting in. If Hamas didn't use rockets to rebel against the blockade Gazans would have died. It's almost like a mass murder. Hamas wants to make a comprimise, meanwhile Israel doesn't. Israel said they would make a comprimise with Hamas. So Hamas stopped firing rockets, meanwhile Israel never met with them to make a comprimise. Israeli's are cowards that always make up excuses. They are the terrorists of the world. WHy do you think the UK and USA gave them Palestine? They gave it to them b/c they didn't want them going over to their land. The stolen land will never be theirs at all, even with all the fighting. Hamas is Palestines army. Palestinians don't have anyone, not even ARABS. That is so sad. It's pitiful.

One good question she could ask is, what evidence is there to support the belief Mohammed was a prophet besides his own claim to be such?  Why does one need to believe in a prophet when it is God we are to believe?  A prophet is one who points the people to God, and not a case of God pointing us to a prophet.    .|`|UujliMsCaa	The command given by Jesus was to love, heal, and share the good news. Most of the time when Christians are "witnessing" they're not really sharing anything loving, healing, or good. My suggestion is grab ahold of how much Jesus loves you unconditionally. When you do, it just comes out of you naturally without any forced "witnessing". You talk from experience and it is good, healing, and loving.    Also... watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JHS8adO3...|`|FDsopi1Taa	You reach out when they are receptive to it. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.
r9nxFkGtaa	Yes, it's bad.  It sets up unhealthy and unrealistic expectations that no one can live up to, leading to broken relationships and loneliness.|`|96AQZUGyaa	No I don't think it is. The only bad porn is that which is literally harmful to people or animals like child porn or that porn where they stand on animals. Otherwise if its made by consenting adults and seen by consenting adults I see no wrong.|`|aymBTRlyaa	Yes, it is.  It's bad for society in that men can get pleasure from it while they're supposed to be in a monogamous relationship. Women are degraded and treated like animals with no care or concern for their health, emotional well-being etc. while also being exploited for no talent, etc. just based on their looks and sex which should be in private.    It also contributes to the "gang rape" mentality and the notion that women like the things that men do to them in pornography, which often times is just demented and sick. And it makes guys think that a woman would really like things like that. The stuff they do in pornos does not stimilate most NORMAL women - love and caring does.    It is nasty and bad for society in genereal. Not even touching on religious reasons.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes theres no love in it...|`|aEdkaXmtaa	it depics women as sexual objects so if it falls into the hands of someone who is too young to understand it doesn't really work like that in real life then yes it can be bad.

If you regularly pleasure yourself to pornography, consider that over a long period of time you may be conditioning yourself.|`|2wrEoTYgaa	Looking at porn, in my religion, is considered a sin. The things these poeple are doing are morally wrong adn you looking at it doesnt help.    It also gives you unrealistic ideas about sex, and how a woman should look and act in bed. For normal women, there is no comparing to the big-breasted, skinny, advanced woman in pornography.     Pornography can also be very addicting. Think of how your wife would feel knowing you still looked at porn while married. Its like her having sex with other men while married to you.   Also, in my religion, masturbating is a sin and a great sin to.     I know these reasons wont change your mind but think about it.. exapand on these ideas (since they are pretty basic and can go into much farther detail about how it cann affect you and your relationship) and try to take some of this advice|`|40whdSDYaa	ITS BAD FOR EVERYTHING>>>>EVERYTHING GETS AFFECTED BY IT|`|qYumuFJIaa	no of course not. not unless you look at porn that is just wrong like little kids porn or animal abuse things out of the ordinary!|`|67EaIAvbaa	pick a bible up and hold it...there's your answer.|`|StuXqez7aa	If you watch porn, you are part of Al-Qaeda.

I'm not saying you can't enjoy sex, you can, and should. But, to exploit women and make it into a game with whips and chains is sick. It wasn't meant for that.|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	yes, it is disapproved of by God because those actions are to be shared between married couples.    as for me, i don't think it is wrong.  i think whatever.  people do whatever people want to do.

My wrist is killing me and I am so chafed that even a small breeze sends me into fits of hysterical crying :-)|`|mkshF2Pfaa	No. It has several negative outcomes, but it is not, when viewed in its entirety, "bad." It creates unrealistic expectations for women, as well as a distorted perception of what sex is often like. However, it speeds up masturbation, contributes to creativity in the bedroom, and has the potential to generally improve sex lives.|`|1EyRH1Lsaa	i dont think it is|`|AsdGvTA0aa	No, it fills computer hard drives which would otherwise be empty|`|jWozLBUeaa	The only problem is that it eats up disk space on my computer.

If you want some sex, go get your own and stop peeking at other people.|`|0GN8kkQYaa	I don't think so. Unless your showing it to immature people that haven't reached adulthood yet. Anyone mature and healthy enough to have sex should be allowed to be in/ or watch porn without feeling guilty.|`|UnuRaYbjaa	yes it is. It is sinning and it is bad for the viewer.

You don't want to get so wrapped up in it and forget about real things like your family girlfriend wife etc.|`|AA10530949	It's bad b/c God doesn't like it, but there are several other secular reasons.  Firstly, it becomes an addiction.  Secondly, it fuels impurity in our thoughts... makes us "sex-charged" instead of normal people!  Also, it can be degrading to BOTH genders because it can affect your perception of sexuality and gender relationship, causing you to lose respect for or not properly appreciate the sexual act.    To keep it simple, I just tell myself God doesn't like it :-)|`|2axY4J8Haa	Pornagraphy is VERY bad if you are a teen or child. and when your older it is just sick.

Don't wait, but don't abandon them. Let them know how you feel and if they don't reciprocate move on romantically. Love doesn't have a timeline so stick around as a friend.    Edit--- If you're already going out with them just enjoy it! easier said than done because I am an analyzer too :)  If he's just your friend, ask him if he's ever thought about you like that (in a round about way EX: you think I would make a good girlfriend? then he would answer like of course you would... and so on and so forth :)    If all else fails and you're thinking about him a lot and spending a lot of time without reciprocity... give him some space. Make him seek you out. People like people/things that are less available. Weird but absolutely true|`|G4vFjh0yaa	No but I have been on the other end of that. Loved by a person I call "my dear friend" who is not shy to admit that she has loved me for many years. Understand that that is not gonna go any farther than the great friendship that we have. After 40 years we have not crossed that line.  Now as you suggest if I did one day feel I too would love as she does then I think I would loose the best friendship and companion that I have known over these 40 years.  We are both successful in our relationships and the success of life.  Tough question.

But you cannot accomplish anything  with a post like this one you just posted. God does not want His Word shared in hate or anger or even hostility.     So rid yourself of those feelings towards those who have not yet found their way to the Lord and just pray for them.When you speak as you are here, you are not being reflective a Christ who is supposed to be living inside your heart, but quite the opposite.

The Book of Proverbs chapter One tells us that the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord and that fools despise wisdom. Proverbs is devoted to warning the wise to flee the company of fools.     God shall have the last say when the fool dies in his unbelief: "I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared." The fool fears bodily death. But they shall have more to fear when it finally becomes apparent to them how they wasted their days in unbelief; how like incorrigible children they refused correction and how easy it would have been for them to obtain salvation from the Lord. But all hope will be lost and there will be no point in arguing anymore. They will go on in eternity hating, wishing that they had never been born...but just like the billions of stars in the visible universe that have been burning for eons (according to their belief in modern science) so shall there souls burn in the torments of Hell.

But I do believe that everyone has their own right to believe in what they want. When it says "One nation under god" and "In God we trust" this is implying that people should believe in God and that this is the "main" religion. I'm sure I would feel offended if it said something that I didn't believe in and I wouldn't feel like the country was acknowledging me fairly. God didn't want us to discourage people in other religions.  I think being Christian is respecting and trying to improve yourself , not other people. Its wonderful if someone wants to believe in God, but we or the government should not imply or force people that this is the right way of doing things. You just have to look at it from a different point of view.|`|AA12181796	"Generally speaking, a lot of Atheists have it in their heads that because they don't believe in a God, no one else should"  A lot of Christians have it in their heads that everyone should believe what they do, and go to far greater lengths to make this happen, I would say. So what's your point?    "Many Atheists think they're smarter than the rest of the world and are quick to point out flaws in other people."  Again, this also describes a lot of Christians.    "is it really hurting you that our money says "In God We Trust" or that the pledge of allegiance says, "One Nation Under God"? Why can't you just ignore it?"  Because you're *not* one nation under God, and it completely excludes *anyone* who isn't Christian, not just atheists. I don't live in the States, but I can easily understand why it would bother atheists to not have the possibility that God isn't real acknowledged, just like it *would* bother numerous Christians if your money and your pledge of allegiance explicitly said that God wasn't real - this would be the real opposite of the way it is currently; simply not having any mention of God is striking an all-inclusive balance.    "It just seems to me that MORE Atheists than Christians do this. There's proof all over Y!A R&S. Can you really be so blind to not see it?"

In order to answer this question don't we need an absolute?  How are we to measure? According to who's definition?|`|p18BmlIxaa	"Evil" is a loaded, charged, ill-defined term which I refuse to entertain.  I have no idea what you mean when you say "evil".  For all I know, you could mean me, simply because I don't believe in god.  Were that the case, our definitions most definitely would not agree, since I am, by all accounts, an honest, compassionate and moral person.     Sociopaths exist.  That is the closest thing to a definition of "evil" that I can come up with.  People who hurt other people intentionally and unjustifiably, and feel no remorse: i.e. serial killers, rapists, perpetrators of genocide, etc.  But then again, some sociopaths (some children with RAD, for instance) have extensive psychological damage that makes them that way.  So I still don't like the word "evil".  To me, it has a connotation that suggests there is something "inherent" about the quality.  I don't think that's necessarily the case.|`|fYwrSBB0aa	Only in your mind.|`|32bZ0JEDaa	yes can't you tell rapers murders people that love to cause hurt and pain to others hater of any race molestation, etc etc etc|`|2J0vKZDVaa	you rang?|`|CQo3Y0Jmaa	Evil and good to me are a state of mind and it is in each of us but we have the ability most of us to control our inner emotions so evil acts exist and so do good acts but few people even if other think they are evil consider themselves evil.

aj5IBTuXaa	When God divides by zero, it is a doubly undefined operation.  Once because math doesn't define the result.  The second part, because God isn't real either.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof. Will you do that for me?    I am a Nurse, with real medical education, training and knowledge.    I've had hate mail from these so-called "vampires", public attacks in the Y/A! forums, death threats, told to "shut up", told I don't know what I'm talking about, told I'll wake up "covered in blood", etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum. Every single one I've invited to come find me, and told them where and when. Guess they couldn't get out of remedial math class that morning.

First you must have no fear. Vampires can read fear.  If you are the tiniest bit fearful on what might happen when you encounter a vampire. You will never get one to visit.   Colors. believe it or not colors attract vampires.   Vampires are not all gothic. they don't just wear reds and blacks and capes. You could have spoken to a vampire and never knew that they were a vampire.   Wear simple flowing clothes. Alot of people choose dark purples almost black its so dark. Others choose blues. mid-night blue.   It is to your own preferance as to what you wear.   But the biggest thing is don't let fear own you. Vampires will not visit you if you are afraid of them.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	You are aware that Vampires aren't real correct?

And this reminds me of school (7th grade), the girls INTENTIONALLY dressing in the lowest cut shirt they can find and the pants that make it most obvious they have a thong on and the guys staring and acting like their listening while the girls give the ridiculous, passionate look.

I worked with a woman that wore a shirt everyday that made her boobs look like they were struggling for air. All the men would say such disguising things behind her back. It's also intimidating to see someone flaunting their boobs. If I want to see breast I will go to the beach or hire an escort.
a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	You have and easy win.  Study well and you have an easy time.  Intelligent Design is not testable.  It simply says that there is some Designer that is responsible.    To refute the major assertions of ID, you need to know them.  Irreducible complexity -- the idea is that there are some systems that are too complex to evolve.  None have ever been demonstrated.  The classic analogy is the mouse trap.  It has five parts.  If you remove any parts, it cannot work as a mousetrap.  Take away the plate and the bar that hold up the trap bar and you still have a paper holder of tie clip.  A scientist testifying in the trial Kitzmiller vs. Dover actually wore one.    Necessity of an organizing force -- spontaneous self-organization  is seen in magnetization of an iron bar, crystal growth, and lasers.    To be science, ID would have to be:  1) Consistent -- it has to explain what is observed and make predictions based on the rules.  A Designer could do anything, so it fails.  2) Parsimonious -- it cannot invoke entities without necessity or evidence (Occam's Razor)  3) Utility -- it must have practical applicability of the predictions; characteristic behaviors of systems should be explained.  4) Testability -- the predictions must be empirically testable and falsifiable  5) Observability -- it must be basedsed on a set observations, often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments  6) Revisability -- it must be correctable and dynamic (modified in the light of observations that do not support it)  7) Progressivity -- if it replaces or refines previous theories, it must be demonstrated that it can better describe observation  8) Peer review -- it must be subjected to scrutiny by the scientific community    Intelligent Design fails all 8 of the above tests for a science.    For further information:  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/|`|E9chZY74aa	Evolution should not be taught as it can not answer the first and second laws of thermodynamics.  This is key and all scientists know it.  Science is defined in this manner.  1) it is observable with the five senses  2) it must be disprovable (not provable as one can prove anything)  3) it must be reproducible    Creation or the beginning is not able to be determined in a scientific manner as none of the criteria is available to scientists.  No one was there in the beginning to record the evidence except God as He did in Genesis 1:1    Here is another point.  In order to know when the world was started, we must have two things.  A calibration, and a rate.  For example if I saw a care on the highway, I could know how fast it was going, such as 60 miles an hour.(that is my rate)  But how long had it been on the road?  I must have a starting point so that I can calibrate it to this point and know how long it has been on the road.  If the car had started 60 miles away, then I would know he had been on the road for one hour.   We have no rate and calibration that will show us the beginning and time since that beginning.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	only darwinists pit one against the other; it isn't necessary for you to follow their lead|`|WF085j2Daa	intelligent design is a contradiction in terms|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	You can tell them that I disagree with the topic. Both evolution and creation use science to back up their theories. They both require faith to believe. They are just two different interpretations of the facts at hand.   Evolution is not an "empirical' science, in that it has never been observed, is not currently happening and cannot be repeated. These are three necessities for something to be considered "testable". It is an interpretation of a one-time event in history, so one must look at it as "historical science", not "empirical science".   It is on the same level as the JFK assassination. It was a one-time event in history and it cannot be repeated. There are several different, opposing theories concerning the JFK assassination, all of which use the same facts, but it will likely never be solved. The theories of evolution and creation are the same way. The facts that are used to support evolution can just as easily be used to support creation.   To force people to believe only the evolutionist's explanation of what happened would be the same as forcing everyone to believe the Warren commission's report of what happened with JFK. "Consensus" does not determine truth.|`|aj5IBTuXaa	The best attack against ID "theories" is that to be a truly scientific theory, they must be capable of being tested to a definitive result.  Every claim of ID requires God's intervention.  To shoot down ID theory here, point out the following:    1.  If God intervened but left no evidence, there is no test to perform.  If there is no test, there is no way to apply science.  Therefore, it must be a non-scientific concept.  2.  If God intervened and left evidence, that is inconsistent with the teaching that says "Only through Faith shall you come to God."  (Not through science, but through faith.)  God will not provide scientific proof because that would violate what he has told us through His son.  3.  The very act of testing violates another rule that says Thou Shalt Not Test The Lord Thy God - this one from the time that Jesus was in the desert confronting Satan, who wanted Him to jump off a cliff to see if God would intervene.  4.  Any action by God would have to be taken in another world, based on what Jesus told us of His kingdom when before Pontius Pilate.  If your ID theories include methods of testing things not of this world, please elaborate.    Another common ploy is the "irreducible complexity" argument that says we are too complex to be evolved by random events and therefore must have been designed by an external intelligence (that is, ID theory).  That is not a provable statement.  As a prime counter-example, offer up an image of a really beautiful snowflake.  Made entirely of water, which is just a molecule based on three atoms that form an angle of about 120 degrees (give or take a couple when allowing for electron cloud distortions.)    Another common ploy is the ID attack on the fragmented fossil record from some epochs.  The problem is that logically, absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence.  You can no more disprove the existence of fossil evidence than you can disprove the existence of God.  Neither can be proven, and exactly for the same logical reason.  You can't disprove a negative.  If we can't find a fossil from a given epoch, it is possible that the fossil isn't where we think it should be, or it doesn't exist because conditions from that epoch destroyed the fossils in some global cataclysm.|`|hmU2udmRaa	you should research kitzmiller v. dover.  plenty of good info there on why i.d. should not be taught in science class.  incidentally, the ruling judge in the case was appointed by george w. bush.|`|v38WXjbFaa	Formal debate structure.

It is also illogical if the world is so complicated that it reguires a designer. Surely god is complicated and would require a designer.|`|yTYWTKSJaa	Say that the foundation of the "Intelligent Design" theory, Irreducible Complexity, was disproven almost immediately upon it's conception.  It has received no peer review support.    Also, an examination of organisms on this earth shows a great many flaws that seem to argue AGAINST an intelligent designer.  For example, humans wisdom teeth, appendix, position of the larynx allowing for choking, our knees not being made for two legs, same with our ankles and spine, pre frontal lobes are too small, our eyes have a blindspot, etc.    People look at it backwards and tend to anthropomorphize everything.  To make it seem like humans are the focus.      Why would a designer put us on this planet?  There is only 30% of the surface that isn't water, and of that 30%, a lot of it is either too hot or too cold for us to live on.  Some design.    Not to mention that sun is going to expand and burn us alive in a few billion years and our galaxy is going to collide into the Andromeda . . . some design.    It's ridiculous.  And as you said, it's not a scientific theory.  An intelligent designer is unfalsifiable, ergo it's not scientific.|`|VAL9ep5uaa	First let me say that I think intelligent design is a scientific theory, but when you're in a debate sometimes you have to take the other side, so my response is in that spirit.     I think your best bet is along these lines.     1. Science looks for material, non-supernatural causes for things.     2. Intelligent design posits a non-material, possibly supernatural cause for life.     3. Therefore intelligent design is not a scientific theory.     If your opponents are clever they will point out that the intelligent designer doesn't have to be a supernatural entity. It could be aliens.     What you have to say at this point is that the aliens also have a material cause, so life has a material cause.     Again, I think you're on the losing side of this debate, but I wish you luck. By all means read the Dover decision. It's badly argued, but that doesn't mean you can't use those arguments. :-)

vquwiGegaa	Samurai philosophy is Samurai's way of life; it has nothing to do with Buddhism. Especially if someone is not a devoted practitioner, and if they are only lay followers of Buddhism, they may not have a full understanding of how good Buddhists should act.      Just look at those Buddhists want to be in America, (1) they don't understand, "One must take refuge in a formal setting under three Jewels with a teacher to be a Buddhist"!!! (2) They think they can pick and choose which theories and philosophy to follow? This how SG* got theirs started and turn cult! (3) They choose which precepts to accept or deviate? (4) They want to believe in Creator God and Buddha at the same times?     (5) They don't understand pay respect to the senior students! (6) they choose to ignore the advices of their teachers and Gurus because they think they know better? (6) they think they can read a few books and call themselves Buddhists?- Even Shakyamuni Buddha had his teachers both known and unknown to the world. (7) They feel they can reach Enlightenment by what little basic understanding or should I say misunderstanding of Buddhism?    (8) Out of trillion of sentient beings, we have one Shakyamuni Buddha- who apparently without the final teacher, and he had reached enlightenment. Everyone of other Enlightened beings always relied on their Gurus and teachers for detail teachings, these American nobodies think they can reach Enlightenment by knowing Four Noble Truth and 8 Folds Paths; the sad truth is following this two philosophy only entitle you to come back as human- those foolish ones....    There are many more foolish choices these so call Buddhists had made and so many precepts had committed and broken, and they don't even know!!! The resultant of those foolish acts is to reborn in three negative paths.    Upon see all of the above reasons; it is not hard to understand why Samurai and Buddhism can mutually degenerate together, when you mixed these two; because those Samurai had committed many same stupid mistakes as many so called "American Buddhists" are making.    I pity them, for these nobodies will continued to be nobodies some other times and some other space!!! And hope not to be too harsh a place as their next stop, for the next millennium kalpas.    *****  Edit: Thank you, Mark S.     We all try to do little bits for the Buddhism, we may not be a great Guru or well know Teacher, but every little bit may help to steer someone into a right place; and we all know this world needs a lot more "True Buddhists" with the "Right Views".|`|uUCTem2Eaa	Buddhism has been incorporated with a lot of ideologies and other religions that are completely inconsistent with it, and Samurai code is just one of them. Remember that Buddhism came to Japan through China, and China had already injected Confucian and Chinese cultural principles into Buddhism before it reached Japan, so it was already soft enough to manipulate when it arrived.|`|pevh5EiSaa	Very well stated STTB, without the proper teacher , without the proper motivation and traditions ...you go nowhere.  It amazes me to see advertisements for "Buddhism ..without the medieval clothing and rituals" what a joke.  The Samurai, had their own code, a mixture of Buddhism and Shinto, you could spend alot of time reading about it, but it pointless.|`|aSjdL4heaa	The Samurai followed Zen Buddhism - which is different from Tibetan Buddhism.  Besides, not all Buddhists are pacifists.  In early history there were Buddhist empires, Buddhist armies, etc.    How does one shoot another in the head (or drop a bomb on them) and follow Jesus?

However in dreams your subconscious can show you what you've been feeling lately. i.e. being chased by something in your dream is often an indicator of stress.    "...but i dont want to because hes MY BEST FRIEND..."    I get the feeling you are young still? My sister was the same way, said the same thing (and she married him). *ahem* Best friend? Yeah...there are reasons why someone of the opposite gender is the best friend sometimes...because you have the chemistry to be loves, but just don't realize it. It's better to marry someone you feel is your best friend (could be someone in the future you feel that way about too) than to marry someone you don't feel so closely too.|`|yBXLgHbmaa	I hope dreams don't come true cause last night I had a dream my bus barrel rolled into the ditch and I was attacked by a rottie.|`|JqHkgWROaa	It means you subconsciously love him and want a family with him.

Why ruin a perfectly good friendship by getting married.    Would you rather marry somebody that isn't your friend ??|`|qTVkydt1aa	It means that you had that dream.

42IzT0Viaa	Why is Pride worse than Lust?    Why is Pride worse than Sloth?    Why is Pride worse than Rage, Gluttony, Envy or Greed?    Take each of these in turn and explain why pride is worse than any of them.  You should also bring up the point that Lucifer's sin, and the sin of Adam, Eve and the apple, can all be traced back to pride.  Lucifer, for thinking he can rule the heavens better than God, and Adam and Eve for thinking that they were good enough to lie and get away with it.  Thus, you could argue that all sin comes from pride and therefore it must be the worst.    This portion from wikipedia sums it up best, but you can (and should!) look for other sources for other arguments:     "In Christianity, pride (Latin, superbia) is seen as the excessive love of one's own worth usually by attempting to remove oneself from subjection to God or valid authorities.[3] A scriptural reference to pride can be found in the Psalms: "In his pride the wicked does not seek Him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God." (Psalm 10:4). Pride is sometimes referred to as the greatest of the seven deadly sins. To that effect, Saint Thomas Aquinas wrote that "inordinate self-love is the cause of every sin." This sentiment was also expressed by Pope Gregory I.[4][5] Curiously Aquinas, who viewed pride as sinful "excessive self love", nevertheless endorsed the possibility of a virtuous kind of pride when he translated Aristotle's virtuous pride (Greek: megalopsuchia) as magninimitas, which in latin means "greatness of soul"; yet Aquinas believed that the greatness that magnanimitas required was beyond the reach of almost all men and that, like pride, it opposed the Christian virtue of humility.[6]"
QYy0vU4maa	Why not talk to her about it? Maybe she does not have many friends and does not know how to act around them.|`|TjgBuLHFaa	Thats nice your talking to her.  Well I think what you should do is ask her if she knows people say shes a lesbian and see her reaction. She will either say "no. i didnt know that." or "yeah. I did. but im not" or "yeah. i am a lesbian" or "yeah. but i didnt know that" shes definetly going to say something along those lines. so just ask her.  and if she likes you she would most likely tell you if she is. Or she'll say know kind of shyly and thats a hint she probably is.    As for the touching you thing. She may just be a friendly kind of person. I mean some girls and guys are just phisically friendly.  So I really think shes doing that because she either definetly likes you or is just like I said a phsically friendly person.  hope I helped good luck! =]  btw if she does tell you shes a lesbian be supportive because if she has know friends like you say shes probably rele lonely and needs support. and she probably feels so alone.  also maybe talk alot about guys you like infront(im asuming your straight?) of her that way she will know you dont go her way if shes lez.|`|SbZ71ME4aa	What is your sexual orientation?

Americans as a whole do not hate any group of people from any country. But the British tend to be anti American and I'm speaking from experience. Europeans in general hate Americans. I find this really hypocritical for them to hate us because of what maybe 200 something years of blood shed when Europe has 1500 years of blood shed on their hands. We don't condemn them for that. And i hate how some Europeans act like the acts of their ancestors were a favor to the world! There was a question the other day where Americans and Europeans were arguing about politics. One European wrote "Europeans created and built colonies in the west that later turned into the USA, if you are white we are probably your ancestors, if you are a descendant of black slaves, we are the ones that brought your ancestors over the atlantic" You have got to be kidding me right? I am Native American, black American and puerto rican. All groups that have been harmed directly by Europeans. I don't blame any of them for their ancestors actions, but are you serious? They think they did the world a favor! I was thoroughly disgusted and amused. The truth is white Europeans robbed the world of the truth and beauty of myriad native cultures  the Aztecs, Incans, Mayans were effectively destroyed and surviving native Americans rounded up and put on reservation. This is the same for all the other countries the British (especially), the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese etc have invaded.  They don't know their own countries history, yet they call Americans stupid and ignorant? Wow. They have no right to condemn America for anything. That is my only problem with the English and other Europeans.    Modernaire's answer is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. The English language was spread around the world by force. They didn't "give"  us anything. America is what it is now because of the American people. It has NOTHING to do with the British who invaded America all ties were severed over 200 years ago.  We did not become a super power until  after WWII. And American culture is nothing like English culture. I know this because my boyfriend is English and lives in London. What i love most about our relationship is our differences. We learn something new from each other everyday.|`|x8Q8T8ETaa	Only some of them that are clever enough to know who we are.|`|vI5NksVfaa	Well, I don't.

UQTAN7cgaa	Most forms of Christianity have no position on freemasonry or a neutral one; several have a positive one. There are a few, including some fundamentalists who believe that unless you worship precisely as they do you are really worshipping satan, who are against it and the Catholic Church frowns upon it saying "you are in grave sin and cannot receive holy communion"... some discourage members from joining, or discourage members of their clergy from being freemasons.    that said, every Christian tradition i know of (and with two college degrees in the history of religions i know a lot of them) have members who are freemasons, including pastors, priests, bishops, cardinals and in the past at least two popes.    to some others:    * God is in a good mood --- you are mistaken. also, there is no worship of any kind in freemasonry, it is not a religion, the individual mason worships through his Church.    * handsome is right, most freemasons are christian; but there are also jews, muslims, buddhist, hindus, etc. that are freemasons and this is a point where some religious fanatics have a problem --- meeting on equal footing with someone of another religion; that is there problem, it is not a freemason problem and it is not a Christ problem, who met on the same footing with everyone    * ignore Queen Kira - she obviously has no direct knowledge of freemasonry - there is no satan worship in any form of freemasonry anywhere, it is not a cult, there are no lower/upper echelons... ugh. there is no illuminati, it died out almost 300 years ago, within 10 years of its founding.... there is no connection between the historic knights templar and freemasonry, the historic KT and rosicrucians, freemasonry and rosicrucians, etc... .ugh, ugh, and ugh.... freemasonry is not marxist, quite the opposite. wow, she really has all the conspiracy junk lumped into one incoherent rant here eh????     * ignore CJ too... he knows Pike never said that, he's admitted it to me and others, yet he continues to post his lie....        *|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	My church is made of brick so i guess it's cool.|`|4LYasBGXaa	why wouldn't they?    one basic tenet of free masonry is that in order to be a member you need to believe in a god or "higher power" that doesn't contradict with christianity.    other than that it is a social organization with rules and guidelines that don't conflict with christianity or most other religions.

AA11104965	"So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence." - Bertrand Russell    ...    Actually, truelydeneith, the book of Proverbs is in the Old Testament.  It isn't a gospel.  You do know what the gospels are, don't you?    If Bertrand Russell is wrong, then surely someone here can find a nice excerpt to prove it.  I've read the gospels, and I don't remember seeing one, either.    And I don't seem to be alone in that.  Not one of the excerpts from the gospels that any of you have mentioned so far praises intelligence.  They tend to encourage blind faith in dogma, which is the antithesis of intelligence.    So if I really am ignorant about this, I'm no worse than the rest of you.  But your inability to provide a counter example would seem to indicate that I'm right. This provides us with an opportunity to see if you really believe the proverb you quoted.

Like most piercings, even if it doesn't hurt with the initial piercing, it will definitely hurt during the healing process, especially having it bunched up in your pants.    I know a guy with a 0g ring in his (and he let me see it too).  I was quite impressed!    Yes, it will affect how you urinate, and you might have to use a toilet and sit to do so instead of using a urinal, but each piercing is individual, you might be able to manage just fine.    I've placed a link below to the BMEzine Wiki page on the Prince Albert, which has tons more information on aftercare and what you can expect from the piercing.  Good luck!|`|TYQOafA8aa	Yes it hurts like hell. your penis will be swollen for weeks and it will hurt as you urinate, you may even urinate blood, you will have to clean it dialy with alcohol, also you sex partner my feel unconfortable if you penetrate him with a pirced penis.|`|jtlcYqutaa	depends how much u like pain and spraying|`|5a7O9ErTaa	do it :)    youl love it.    ive a vch piercing, and love it so much. didn't hurt much, like way less than my belly button did. i know guys are different and all that though|`|2k6lvvfJaa	i got it done a few years back,an wen i took out my bar to clean it my testicle fell out|`|7yDgYOkGaa	I'm heavily into piercing.

YES, abstinence must be practiced for at least 2 weeks or until your body tells you you're to be active.    I would encourage a PA piercing as the sensation of wearing one cannot be described, especially during sex.  Currently, my PA is a 00 gauge; but it took long intervals before stretching the hole.

ZgJXCDF3aa	I love it when atheists talk about having a conscience. I thought "conscience" was a God thing.     Atheists in this country enjoy a morality in culture that comes from a lease in a Christian heritage. When the last of us are gone, then the 'law of the jungle" takes over.     In that day they will be scratching their heads wondering "where did the morality go?"      I will quote Alexander Solzhemitsyn, to make the point as to why I think all this happened in Russia.       "More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened."    "Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on the history of our Revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some sixty-million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened."    "What is more, the events of the Russian Revolution can only be understood now, at the end of the century, against the background of what has since occurred in the rest of the world. What emerges here is a process of universal significance. And if I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century, here too, I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: Men have forgotten God." http://www.roca.org/OA/36/36h.htm    American Atheists are a little spoiled and very naive of world history.|`|wia35rNKaa	I am failry certain that nowhere in the bible does it say priests shall not have sexual relations with young boys...but it happens anyway. Just cause it doesnt say so in the bible does not mean it is right or wrong, which means that if it doesnt mean anything whether the bible says do or not do, then it shouldnt matter what "book" says do or not do.    And the society decides argument is subjective and would not be that great either...even though other societies were appalled at what hitler was doing, his own society would have said he was doing the moral right thing.    I am much more afraid of human nature than any wrath of god...humans kill in the name of a god that may or may not exist, and what is even scarier, the people who DO believe in god, and his wrath, still kill, even though it says right in the little book not to.    Problem is, if tomorrow everyone "turned" into atheist, there would be a HUGE problem. How many people would put 2 and 2 together...okay, I am an atheist, there is no god, which means there is no afterlife, which means there is no punishment for sin, which means, as long as I am here, i can do whatever I want.     I would be interested in finding out what the statistics are of criminals who go to jail, find Jesus, are released with Jesus in their hearts, and then get sent back to jail...to see how having Jesus in your heart changes humans natural tendency and nature.

Our understanding that other humans have the same rights we do and the same desire to be safe and keep their own property.    Our morality obviously doesn't come from the Bible because we're the ones arguing that killing every man, woman and child in a city because they didn't worship the right god is immoral.  We're the ones who think wholesale slaughter is immoral even when done by a Biblical "hero" like David.      You guys think killing infants and children is perfectly okay if God wants it done.  That it's okay to kill everyone but the virgins among prisoners and pass the virgins out to the army to do as they want with.  That it's perfectly fine to kill your children if you think God is telling you to. That it's moral to give your virgin daughter to a mob to be gang-raped until she dies.  That's the difference between Biblical morals and humanistic morals.  Biblical morals are repulsive to feeling humans.    EDIT:  Do you actually need a book to tell you that stealing is wrong?

Like a College course.  -- It is meant to be LIVED.    This must be the JOB of a lifetime (in your mind) for you to compromise your beliefs simply to get the job.     Normally a child goes to a series of catechism classes over a period of like 6 years  to become an adult in the Catholic faith.  These classes are usually once per week for an hour at the catholic school or church.     The closest thing to a "crash course" they have is for Adults,  who, because of their maturity, can learn these things more quickly and thoroughly.  Therefore the Rite of Catholic Initiation or RCIA takes just 1 year of classes.  It compresses 6 into 1.    So 1 year is the best you will get.     However,  Generally the Catholic teaching is to not make people compromise their beliefs...therefore they may not want you to convert JUST FOR THE JOB, because this would tempt you to compromise yourself for money.     I know when it comes to other religions attending Catholic Church services,  the Catholic church "officially" urges people to NOT partake in anything (song, prayer, response, sacrament) which violates their beliefs or good conscience. This ESPECIALLY extends to Communion..where the Catholic church, for the benefit of both parties, asks that non-catholics don't partake in communion.     SO I'd feel the SAME principle SHOULD apply to not becoming Catholic for a job.     SIDENOTE:   I don't think Religious institutions are required to be equal opportunity employers for certain jobs, in the same way as other businesses are.  .    I mean I'm not a Lawyer or anything but even I could see where being Jewish,  Budhist, Hindu, or Catholic might be required to hold SOME of  the jobs in those religions.    They might be required to prove to the state that they don't discriminate in MOST of their positions,  but I can see where the State might make exceptions for certain positions which DO require knowledge and belief in the religious doctrines.    However it is true that not all School administrators and Teachers have to be Catholic.  Some are not.   ALSO, not all STUDENTS have to be Catholic either.    The Catholic church has been around for nearly 2,000 years and it is the world's largest Health care, Education, and food provider in the world.  So I'm SURE it has ran into this issue before and does its BEST to comply with ALL the various labor laws in each of the countries it operates in around the world.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	You want to be Catholic for a job?

That would be a violation of the Equal Opportunity Employment Act.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	It sound illegal to me but if that is so you only want to take that job is it pays a lot of money like being pope of something|`|SoF7gxEqaa	I'm pretty sure that unless you are working for the church, thats not legal... and you shouldnt change your beliefs just to get a job.|`|LGagW0Tsaa	Don't worry, when they find out that you aren't, they'll forgive you.

A massive cultural change is bound to occur soon though and I think personally that it might be related. I implore you to educate yourself on the subject though if you're interested    Do the research yourself. seems like something is gonna happen, technology is increasing at ever greater rates, the world is heating fast and millions will be starving in the next few years.  multiple Ancient Cultures predicted this exact date and significant Astrological phenomenon are definately occuring related to this date.  Hell crop circles are even CODED to it, and dude those things are way more complex than humans COULD make. It's up to us to make the change a reality.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night". If you believe or not, that is up to you; either way it still comes.    Things to look for to PROVE it to yourself soon:    >Fall of America as an economic power and other ways.

jcK6EXpiaa	There are a lot of teachings regarding wind, a lot of scientific theory as well that was later proven true. One of which being that there are four winds, and well, its hard to explain in english. Google the four winds design (it looks like a swaztica) and maybe something from my culture will come up. IT will be hard for you, a non-native, to find a lot of this info because we like to sort of keep it to ourselves, and our elders for the most part are computer illeterate. :) anyways, wind, like breath, holds certain powers...arg...hard to explain cultural concepts without the proper language...ok, in my language, wind means somehting like "sacred breath" or "holy breath" or "gods breath"...so yeah, take what you can from that. Sorry for being so scetchy, i am debating weather or not to go into detail..nah, I'm at my max today. I'll explain more tomorrow or e-mail you later.|`|J3erdQCIaa	Wind is wind....As a Lakota, we were in touch with nature but I don't think wind had any significance, it was part of the world and part of nature.    BTW Wind in Lakota is Tate (Tah-tay)
IcTBvG0saa	These words are spelled very very bad. If you have the original text it would help a lot. Not the words you think that are spelled that way.    The first one looks like "prora?unato", pronounced as pro-ra-choo-nah-toh. If that is correct - it means calculatedly / calculatingly. If i.e. you were told that you are " prora?unata " - it means that ' you are a calculating person '.    The second one starts with ' zdravo ' which meas hello / hi. Other two word are not understandable, sorry.  It is not a Bosnian 'raja' slang either.  OR  If it is a mixture of Bosnian and English slang, it can be transliterated like ' Zdravo, pu?ni buttas ' and translated as 'Hi, smoke some buttas ' / "hi, try some buttas"  ( buttas = slang terminology used for crack )

84nXWNT3aa	"An it harm no one, do what ye will."    ^That, from what I've heard is the basis for Wiccan morality.     As long as what your doing poses no harm to anyone, it's okay.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	My understanding is that they believe so long as you're not hurting others, then it's alright to do whatever you want.  So, abstinence, sex and sexual preferences are not harming yourself or others, so it's up to you.  Pornography COULD be seen as harming others if the people in the pictures are underage or coerced, but could be seen as not harming if the people in the pictures chose to take the money, so it's a judgment call on that one.|`|qnt1wAfiaa	There is no central authority in Wicca, so there is no one answer. However, most Wiccans tend to be fairly liberal when it comes to sexuality.      The only thing that would be considered 'common ground' would be that no reputable group would use sex as part of the initiation.|`|yljPx5qsaa	Wicca is generally devoid of all such stupid Christian ideas of sexual morality. Why should you be abstinent? Why shouldn't you have sex with the same sex if so inclined? Why shouldn't you look at pornography?|`|uUCTem2Eaa	My understanding is that Wiccans view sexuality as a positive thing, good in many ways (not just for reproduction), and thus not something to be ashamed of or confined to certain parameters, but something to be celebrated.    As the Wiccan crede says, "An ye harm none, do what thou wilt!" So as long as you're not hurting anybody (as, say, rape would), have a good time.    But be sure not to hurt yourself as well. Be sure to use protection when it's called for.|`|UNVJWxTmaa	It is a personal choice.  You should meditate and ask your deity for direction.    Personally, I feel pornography is harmful, to the people doing it and those watching it.  But that is just my opinion and my path.  You get to chose your own, as long as you hurt no one.|`|UxooffHZaa	Wicca as a whole has no stances on any of these topics, but individual covens or churches may. Most are fairly liberal minded though.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	Ive only heard of perversions among the wiccan community.   Unless you consider a buncha topless women dancin in the moon light as ok.|`|bYDVTv7Maa	Well, most Wiccans don't really care. Your life is your life.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	For the most part, Wicca actively embraces sexuality. You do not have to be abstinent and your sexual preferences will not be seen as evil or wrong.|`|AA12360579	Two points.  :)    Edit:  Alright, alright.  Wiccans believe that being open with one's self and one's sexuality is healthy and that there's no reason to be ashamed of one's body.  Abstinence is still probably a personal choice, but I'd imagine that there aren't many Wiccans who would find it necessary.|`|Lm3JBhfzaa	Views are varied on pornography. No moral person would pressure you or worse into having sex. If you choose to abstain, okay that's fine, if you choose not to, then please practice safe sex. Most Wiccans and traditions are accepting of GLBT members. Sex is consider sacred, unless its done without the other person's consent or is harmful to you or your partner.|`|3RYqo9dJaa	If you wanna be abstinent go ahead, if you don't that's fine too.  Sexual preferences, the same as above.  And for pornography the same.    As long as you don't hurt people (S&M is ok though) ;) it's all good.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	We generally believe that as long as everyone is an adult and consenting, its none of our business.  Sex is not a pollutant in Wicca.  It is not inherently sinful, as Christianity has traditionally taught.  Sex can be sacred.  On the flipside, virginity has its own value and meanings.  I would never encourage someone to have sex who wanted to remain abstinent.    My experience is that Wiccans tend to be open to all sexual preferences.  There are, however, certainly exceptions to that.  There is such a thing as a conservative Wiccan.|`|Wr09qsYMaa	i refuse to contribute|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	personal preference    I am sure that any Wiccan would tell you that what you do , is your business|`|tg9Wj5Bpaa	wicca is kinda like the liberaterions of religion.  do what you want as long as it harms none.  I studied wicca when i was younger.  i am just pagan now, and i am a gay man.  i knew lots of gay guys, and of course there is sexual magic.  very interesting stuff.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	"Harm non and do what ye will"     As long as you are not hurting any one, then there is noproblem. Rarely to Covens disapprove of any sexual preferance. And no, you do not have to be abstinent.    "Let My worship be within the heart that rejoices, for behold, all acts of love and pleasure are My rituals. Therefore let there be beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, mirth and reverence within you"|`|6af5c52eca3b7e0a3a16387319a25f6baa	We have no rules which prohibit homosexuality, nudity or pre-marital sex. Sex as the generative force in nature is seen by most pagans as something utterly sacred. We feel that the physical act of love is to be approached with great respect and responsibility.    Pornography is a physical representation of the act of love (for the most part), so the only taboos regarding it are the legal ones.
76Wp8OINaa	Hopefully not much longer. I don't mean to sound cruel spirited but charity begins at home, we should fix our own problems before sending more money overseas.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	They can give however much money they want to give to Africa but it won't make a difference it'll probably end up buying some corrupt official expensive homes and cars. The only think that is productive that foreign nations can do is to invest in other nations and hope for the best.    Africa needs to get their act together, end all their wars and invest in education (foreign investors/companies like an educated workforce), end or reduce corruption and things should turn around. People are so eager to invest in Africa because it is an untapped market (for the most part) and there is so much money to be made there but investing is too risky in some African Countries so they bring their money and invest it in other more stable countries.|`|uC2Whritaa	It's like a dark soulless pit  over there. Money just goes down the drain, wasted. What I can't understand is what with all the famine, diseases, and Africans killing each other for so many years, how come there's STILLLL sooooo many left???|`|OTnSwNwZaa	I think that Western nations should stop giving aid to Africa (and stop EXPLOITING the resources). They should just set up fair trade agreements with African nations for resources. That way, African nations will be able to become more powerful. I don't see this happening any time soon though.|`|faIaIvDiaa	as long as if there's AIDS|`|5c00bcce7f9e5a342a4dc9b637cfd85eaa	For as long as wars continue in Africa.  I'd say most of the aid sent to Africa makes its way to funding wars of mad men.  Too much corruption and war in Africa for any of the money being sent over there to do much good.
JqHkgWROaa	How bout how Jesus doesn't qualify to be the Messiah?    Matthew and Luke both hold Geneologies.   The prophecies say Jesus will descend from David through Solomon.  One Geneology shows David through Nathan. The other goes from David through Solomon but also goes through Jeconiah - whom God cursed and said to record this man as if he were childless, (therefore the geneology stops at him).    How bout the proclamation that God is merciful, yet has no problem condemning us (who live avg. 80 year life) to an eternity of torture for a rather short lived life?    How bout the proclamation that God is just yet has no problem allowing murderers and theives in heaven simply due to repentance, meanwhile condemning non-believers (no matter how well of a life they lived) to an eternity of torture?    How bout this. If the Bible were truly God's word, why did he leave such an important task of creating it to his fallible creation? His creation that is quite prone to lying (and temptations of Satan)?    How bout the fact that the Bible states that the earth is flat (Matthew 4:1-12, Job 38:14, Daniel 4:10-11)? That the earth is square (Rev 7:1)?|`|DDFgKxcaaa	the creation myth|`|89MKzLl3aa	No flaws. However, I'm sure the unfaithful will try to fine them, and distort or misinterpret verses.    Edit:@the reverend Soleil- evidence of what, hon?|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Yes. It leaves EVERYTHING it says "room for misinterpretation".    This is why the bible is used to say any goddamned thing anybody wants it to say.    If we atheists decided to walk away one day, the arguments wouldn't stop. They'd just turn on each other with their dancing angels arguments.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	the bible as a whole has nothing to dispel Faith.   however if a person takes takes the whole story and starts tearing it  apart word for word, you will find Flaws everywhere, expecially in the 4 gospels and the nativity.     it only took me ONE verse of contradictory to repent of the flawless bible tradtion.     BUT!!! that doesnt mean the gospel is not true, even if there are as many as 5000 errors. or even if there are a 100 gospels and 20 different translations.     what makes the difference is translation and interpretation. Not everyone can be be PHd in languistics or a Historian of celestial glory.   i think the grace of our saviour takes that into consideration and why at the same time he can show mercy even unto us who disagree among ourselves.|`|U5zcbHuZaa	Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John contain four incompatible accounts of events surrounding the resurrection. The general theme of resurrection is consistent, but details about who went to the tomb and found it empty, who first met the resurrected Issa, the number of angels that appeared, and a few other things all change across the four stories. They are absolutely incompatible in their details. Read them, they are near the end of each of those books.    The only constant in the details is the presence and central role of Mary Magdalene in discovering the tomb empty (though in one story, she doesn't discover it empty, she's scare by the entrance being opened or something like that and goes to get some of Issa's apostles).    This is definitive proof that not every word of the Bible is true, but it is not proof that everything in the Bible is not true.    The two lineages given for Issa are also incompatible, study them closely, and they both give lineage through a man who was not his father.    Revelation 22:18-19 contains warning about corrupting scriptures, which therefore means it is a statement that scriptures can be corrupted, that Allah has not given them protection.    Muslims should note that in extrapolating Rev. 22:18-19 to cover the entire Bible, it also covers other holy books, including Qur'an. That's my opinion or belief, anyway.|`|616a99915f084da240aeba13c2d5e2c8aa	No.  The Bible is infallible.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Apart from the fact that it's completely unsupported by the evidence?|`|ATPPWOpWaa	No, there are not.  If you were to listen to those that hate God and His Bible then they can make a very good argument that there are thousands of flaws in the Bible.  That is until the knowledgeable Christian answers all of those questions one by one.  There are websites that list biblical flaws.      There are also sites that negate those claims as well.  One thing is for sure, youll never come to the understanding of the truth by those that hate it.|`|ij5Sv6staa	Lots of them, the bible is man's attempt to define god based on human experience and language.  This is like a "bronze age" man trying to write down how a TV works.  Even if you did your best to describe it to him, I'm sure there would be some flaws in what he writes down.....|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Jesus IS The Living Word!  (John 1:1.)  It is just distorted by man!  |`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no|`|Rk5D1m8oaa	Yeah, that Noah lived within walking range of every single animal on the planet.|`|fxp8qIsIaa	Alas the only flaw is how it is interpreted|`|WzsdjtPFaa	I think the flaws started when Constantine and his buddies picked over, eliminated, and sometimes destroyed scripts to suit their purpose.|`|22de26f75b15a054a9f0b24dec437f77aa	I'm sure there is, it was written by men.

Apparently, not impregnating your dead brother's wife is fatal.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no but some commas are left out which can confuse ppl...|`|jfmb79V4aa	The whole book is flawed and has no evidence to support it apart from itself.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	tons    like the disagreement between salvation by faith only vs by works    like the disagreement between the gospels on the week of jesus' death    like the NT which quotes a flawed greek translation of the tanakh, while the christian OT, even with it's flaws, i normally a translation of the hebrew tanakh    like all the many references to non-canonical books    like the very concept of canon    like the "prophecies" of jesus from the OT which are based on misinterpretation and looking backward for things that fit    etc...|`|EVby6dGCaa	If you try to interpret it literally, it's riddled with all sorts of flaws. It utterly collapses under the weight of its contradictions and just plain mean-streak comments.    However, that's not what it's about.    What it's about is humankind's search for meaning in this universe, and it's a record of our striving to understand this world, ourselves, and God.    For the non-literalists, it has no fatal flaws; it has an awesome beauty, and incredible wisdom and a transcendent view of eternity.    It has some incredibly awful thinking in it, but that simply is a mirror of the views of the time when it was written. That people could be so utterly off the mark in terms of discussion of good and evil, and yet so incredibly on the mark at the same time in terms of our relationship to God places this text in a class by itself.|`|47sALOGfaa	Love god.  Mark 12:30  Fear god. Proverbs 16:6  There is no fear in love.  1 John 4:18    The christian cult guide book is nothing more than fairy tales and boogeyman stories written by men in order to keep the uneducated masses amused, in line, and obeying commands to further the authors own socio-economic agenda.|`|FBrwlhPtaa	The only flaws are within the misinterpretations.

It is a good thing to be informed of all the religious ideas before making a decision about what you want to believe in. That is a sign of intelligence. It is better than denying something you don't agree with, just because someone tells you to!

I suspect there's a part of you that does believe in God, but you're just confused since you're not sure what you believe to be the one, correct religion. Although you are drawn towards Islam, the negative hype created by media concerning Islam is not helping you in any way, and perhaps, you feel that, by admitting your interest in Islam, you might be given a hard time by people around you. Just pray to God for guidance, and get hold of a translation of the Quran. M. Yusuf Ali's version is really good.|`|WalnRzfGaa	you don't understand anything about religion.    the lose of your mother in Christianity should not shake your faith in the Christian God. it should give you the feeling she is in a better place and help ease your pain of her loss.    Atheism is not the hate of anything, its just the idea that there is no evidence for God then obviously doesn't exist.    you cant believe in Islam if you don't think there is a God.      please educate yourself on how these things work.|`|AA11048332	I'm sorry to hear about you mother's death.  You must have love her tremendously.   God uses bad things in one's life to bring him closer to Him and to test our faith in Him.  In the book of Job, Job lost all his family, wealth and health, yet he still trusted in the Lord to bring Him out of his distress.  Amid all his trouble He still praised God. And that paid of big time in the end when God gave him double that he lost.  That has to be the BEST story in the WHOLE Bible!

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!"

These kids are probably from families that don't teach the same values as the rest of the school population.  They have been taught to be suspicious of authority figures.  There are also pressures placed on them to conform to stereotypes.  They are encouraged to be fiercely independent and defiant.  They don't see the teacher disciplining them as for the greater good of the class, they interpret it as an attempt to exercise control over them.    I know you aren't being racist.  When you see a distinction between races in behaviour try to disassociate yourself from the situation to determine if the difference is really racial or could be attributed to other factors.|`|EmCnVbMXaa	depends. if your school is mainly white then it is harder to be different. so people put up walls and continually talk. also the fact that they are black makes you more prone to notice them. when a white kid acts up you dont say "why do all the white kids act up". This is because there are many more white kids to make you not think that and you are white. so naturally you do not make a stereotype about your own race. I bet if you went to a mainly black school it would be the reverse. because if there is a smaller amount of black people in your school and you see 5 of them act up, then you say its cause there black. you say your not racist but you are. but only subconsciously. you might not be a bigot but it is a thin line. you think racist thoughts but dont act racist. almost all people are subconsciously racist so you shouldnt feel bad.    next time ask why are those three always acting up. maybe there home life sucks. they are unhappy. or maybe they are friends and dont give a damn. if you were blind you wouldnt jump to conclussion that they are acting up because they are black.|`|sn5334Kqaa	It only gets worse when you grow up.

'*********' sounds too much like '******' to be comfortable... i believe the common word many blacks use is 'trifling' because that's what these (ridiculous) people are. there's also 'thuggish,' but many such blacks take that -wrongfully- as a compliment.    many black people feel they must play a role of continuance in a counter-culture that stands apart from traditional, working society in order to stay true to their roots and their communities. sadly, not many blacks -or any other people actually- seem to know the phrase 'rise above your raising,' which commands to do better and be better than your roots, not to wallow in the place you were born.     in the case of many blacks, the system of oppression they were victim to robbed them of much wisdom and a proper upbringing, with many of the values that others take for granted missing; it sounds like a cop out, but many simply don't know better -on top of not necessarily wanting, or feeling deserving of, knowing better. when people in the same social strata try to help *********, triflin' blacks, they take it as an insult, as a way to demean them into a subservient position, because that's the only power struggle they know.    i'm afraid there's not much that can be done to help these people, other than keeping a door open for education and opportunities for qualified individuals. simply giving money to poor communities almost never creates a solution -unless those communities already had cohesiveness, good values and a solid work ethic. many triflin' blacks don't want to listen to authority, and once physically mature or financially independent, may feel they have the 'right' to be as contrary as they wish -even if it harms themselves or their community. it seems the only way a solution can emerge is for life to hit these people hard between the eyes, and for themselves to see the truths in life by experiencing much hurt and pain -at the hand of their own actions. -either that or wait for an aspirational black leader rich and successful enough that even gangsta aspirationals will take notice. for now, there is a question as to if obama can be that person (i don't think he's quite rich enough).    -of course, there will always be thugs and *********, trifling people in any group, who will persist no matter their upbringing. we are, in the year of 2009, not quite there yet to make that general statement about blacks. for now, most of these contrarian fools stand apart because their born values don't tell them to know any better -or worse, to stand against knowing better.      EDIT: while there are those blacks who are functionally retarded, most contrarian blacks are actually very intelligent, highly capable people who simply have different guiding values from the rest of us. it is this trait that causes them to act differently.    EDIT: WTF, n-e-g-r-o-i-d is not an insult or bad word, it is a scientific term that describes a 'race' like caucasoid and mongoloid. the Y!A censors are wack. -furthermore, n-i-gg-a-r-d-l-y is also not a bad word and long existed as a seperate term before n-e-g-r-o ever entered the english vernacular!    EDIT: blacks are justifiably separately identified because they have their own, separate culture. 'urban' does not quite encompass the specific upbringing and background of blacks.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	they are testing the waters.....then why do you discuss race then???

I don't believe in reincarnation because that is opposite of everything that Christians are taught about Jesus Christ and His ministry. If someone who claims to be a Christian also believes in reincarnation, then they aren't Christian. A true Christian is one who accepts that Jesus Christ died for all of Man's sins, and that He paid our debt in full beginning when He was nailed to the cross.

The universe is not static as once thought and it is now understood that the current configuration of our universe has been the result of a great expansion from an earlier very dense form. For all intensive purposes this was indeed the beginning of our universe, but that is not to say that which constitutes our universe did not exist in some other form prior to the big bang.    Maybe our universe just keeps repeating itself in an infinite loop of bang, death, bang, death, etc. or perhaps another very different variation of our universe existed before us and us and the cycles ahead just keep repeating in a never ending loop or perhaps it is just one different universe after another ... there is just no end to the possibilities. The big bang is not much more than a head ache for anyone who wants to find out more because it is a massive impenetrable wall for people delving into history. The event of the big bang was so catastrophic and left so little evidence to what existed before it that we may never truly understand what came before, but that doesn't mean we will ever stop trying.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Our current universe had a beginning.

Using similar triangles,       where y is the misalignment distance of each tidal bulge, m is the Moons mass, mb is the mass of each tidal bulge, and G is the gravitational constant. Solving for (Fn - Ff)      Equation 1b showed that the mass of a tidal bulge, mb, is approximately proportional to 1/R3, that is      where C1 is the constant of proportionality. Therefore      The velocity of the Moon (or any body in a circular orbit) is      where M is Earths mass (or the mass of the central body).  Differentiating both sides with respect to time (t) and solving for gives      Because the Moons tangential acceleration, , is equal to , which is known from equation (2)      The slight displacement of the tidal bulge (y), as mentioned earlier, is proportional to the difference in the Earths spin rate (w) and the Moons angular velocity (wL). In other words,      Substituting (4) into (3) and replacing the product of all constants by C gives      C is found by using todays values (subscript t)      Keplers third law shows how (w - wL) varies with R:      Applying the law of conservation of angular momentum gives      where the constant L is the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, and P is Earths polar moment of inertia. Combining (7) and (8) gives      Substituting (6), (7), and (9) into (5) gives us the final equation. Because it has no closed-form solution, it will be solved by numerical iteration. The steps begin by setting the clock to zero and R to its present value of 384,400 km. Then time is stepped backwards in small increments (dt) until the centers of the Moon and Earth are only 15,000 km apart. Had this happened, ocean tides would have steadily grown to a ridiculous 12.8 km (8 miles) high and left marks on Earth that would bebut obviously are notvisible.8      The QuickBasic program that solves this system of equations (shown on page 427) gives 1.2 billion years as the upper limit for the age of the Moon. (If the Moon began moving away from Earth 1.2 billion years ago, the Earth would have rotated once every 4.9 hours.)  Two complicated effects were neglected that would further reduce this upper limit for the Moons age.9  1. Evolutionists believe that the Earth formed by gravitational accretion of smaller bodies. If so, the impacts would have left a molten Earth. The Earth, throughout its history, would have been less rigid than it is today. Therefore, tidal bulges would have been larger, causing the Moon to spiral away from the Earth even faster than we calculated here.    2. Internal friction from tidal stretching of the solid Earth reduces Earths spin velocity. A greater value for w in the past would have increased the tidal misalignment and the Moons recession over what we assumed above. This would have been especially severe if the Earth had been less rigid in the past.    Incorporating these effects into the above analysis would make the upper limit on the Moons age even less than 1.2 billion years.  One might argue that 1.2 billion years ago the Moon was captured by the Earth or blasted from the Earth by an extraterrestrial collision.10 These events would have placed the Moon in a very elongated orbit. Today, Earths Moon and most of the almost 200 other known moons in the solar system are in nearly circular orbits.11 So many circular, or nearly circular, orbits are difficult for evolutionists to explain with any rigor.12 Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the Moon (1) was captured, (2) was blasted from Earth by an extraterrestrial collision, or (3) somehow began orbiting Earth 1.2 billion years ago. Its orbit is too circular. (Other problems with evolutionary theories on the Moons origin are discussed under Origin of the Moon on page 28.)  Besides mountain-eroding tides, what other implications would a 1.2-billion-year-old Moon have for organic evolution and the age of Earth? Evolutionists claim that certain fossils are 2.83.5 billion years old. Had the Moon begun orbiting Earth 1.2 billion years ago, such fossils would have been pulverized by the havoc of gigantic tides. Evidently, the Moon did not originate near Earth. This further reduces the maximum age of the Moon.  All other dating techniques must assume how fast the dating clock has always ticked and the clocks initial setting. For example, radiometric techniques assume, with much less certainty, that each radioactive isotope has a constant half-life. This analysis on the Moons recession assumes that only the law of gravity has been constant. Neither assumption can be proven, but there is no doubt which assumptions scientists would favor. If Newtons law of gravitation did not hold in the past, our scientific foundations would crumble. However, if the Moon is less than 1.2 billion years old, a few evolutionary preconceptions must be discarded. But thats progress.

Even though they don't have a Bible?    Could it be that the evolutionary cost of excessive inbreeding (loss of diversity in the gene pool) results in the development of traits that prevent such an occurrence?  Populations that have these traits in place would tend to have higher fitness in most situations than populations that didn't, thus resulting in a selective pressure for a mechanism to exclude close blood brood.    In most other species, this is maintained by kicking the kids out of the house before they reach the stage where it becomes an issue (i.e. wild cats, wolves).|`|AA11987172	Then how did Adam & Eve populate the earth?|`|snj9zznvaa	didn't work you're all inbread retards|`|zkETPA8waa	Was that before or after the entire human race generated itself from two people, ie Adam and Eve?

WpA7n8Iwaa	What keeps coming back to me is this    Jud 1:20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,    Jud 1:21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.     AND    Gal 5:16 [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.   Gal 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.    Gal 5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.       To me it's like staying in shape - you can make it real complicated, but if you do the basics, you'll stay where God wants you.  To stay in shape, you really need to eat right and exercise.  To be right with God I need to read, pray, and when it comes right down to it, avoid temptation!!!!  Kind of boring, but that works for me.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	When I was a very new believer, someone said to me, "The Christian life is not difficult; it is impossible."  We all struggle, and what works for one of us does not necessary work for another.   My only answer to your question is to keep "hanging in", spend time with other believers, attend Christian services, and pray.|`|HBp5r76haa	We "cannot" is the most sensible answer.  The truth is, it is not up to us, but Salvation is the supernatural work of the Spirit of God. If we truly believed and accepted Christ in our heart, then the Spirit dwells in our heart and He will lead us and we will walk with Christ. But we will never achieve this out of our own strength. If we could do that, then Salvation would be earned and would not be by grace alone.    So, submit your will to Christ and let Him finish the work He has started in you.     What you *can* do, though, is get to know Him: you can't accept someone you don't trust, you can't believe someone you do not accept and you can't trust someone you do not know. A relationship with Christ is developed daily through the studying of His Word and prayer.    You ask for verses: I would suggest the whole Gospel of John, as well as 1 John and the letter of Paul to the Romans     God bless you|`|tManvxfQaa	By abiding in Gods Word and obeying Him  and not man    Ask for the old paths and walk there in :  Jer 6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where [is] the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.

Have fun and laugh and be joyful before the Lord.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	By simply trusting.    2 Samuel 7:28  O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.    Hmmm.. I think He also gives us wonderful friends, who are humble.    Zephaniah 3:12  But I will leave within you the meek and humble, who trust in the name of the LORD.    Again, about trust:  Proverbs 28:26  He who trusts in himself is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe.    More than anything, prayer.    Psalm 51:10  Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.    And thanksgiving.    Sowing Generously   6Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. 7Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. 9As it is written:     "He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor;        his righteousness endures forever."[a] 10Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. 11You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to the Father.    2 Corinthians 9:  12This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. 13Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. 14And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you. 15Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!      wow-- did not mean for this to be so long.  Hope it helps!  God bless!|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    I recommend you read Galatians 5 (short chapter), every day for a week.

UWlRLXvRaa	We abide by faith. (Faith is a response to God & what He has said). The hard part is that we don't always feel like abiding. But I've come to realize that abiding is an act and not a feeling.    There have been days where I felt so weary and overwhelmed that I didn't have much to give to God in my 'quiet time'. Being raised a Charismatic, I was incorrectly taught that I had to put on a show for God if He was to "show up" or abide with me. That was a lie! So on days where I was too tired to praise Him I felt SO guilty. (There is a time to praise Him too but that's another subject).  But then the most wonderful thing happened to me. God reminded of that old hymn that is sung @ Billy Graham crusades - "Just as I am". He reminded me that it is not only for the beginning of our relationship w/Christ, it's also for all of our relationship with Jesus.    "Just as I am, without one plea,  But that Thy blood was shed for me,  And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.    Just as I am, and waiting not  To rid my soul of one dark blot,  To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.    Just as I am, though tossed about  With many a conflict, many a doubt,  Fightings and fears within, without,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.    Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;  Sight, riches, healing of the mind,  Yea, all I need in Thee to find,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.    Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,  Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;  Because Thy promise I believe,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.    Just as I am, Thy love unknown  Hath broken every barrier down;  Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.    Just as I am, of that free love  The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove,  Here for a season, then above,  O Lamb of God, I come, I come!"    Remember when that Samaritian woman ran into Jesus @ the well and she tried to impress Him with her religious knowledge? She was "showing off" & trying to "fix" Him. She thought he was just a Jew who needed to be put straight. They didn't usually talk to her so it was a rare opportunity for her to show Him just how smart and right she was. She was putting her best foot forward & thought He would be impressed. (Remember how she didn't tell Him about her past or all of her present choices?) Well He wasn't.    Sometimes we Christians do the same thing with God. We only give Him our best foot. We only put our best foot forward with Him. But if we do that, we don't get very far with Him.The Samaritan woman didn't. Jesus went right to her heart. And that's what He does with us. Not to shame us but to quench our thirsty souls. If you want to walk with God, He requires both of our feet! Our 'best foot' and our 'worst foot' And if we find that in our daily lives we step in somethings we shouldn't have and sometimes we know we shouldn't but we went and stepped in it anyway like a foolish sheep do from time to time..., we still bring our feet to Him for He is the only one who can wash us.     Peter didn't want to have Jesus wash his feet because of his pride but Jesus told him that if he didn't let Him wash his feet then Peter would have no part of Him.    But back to the woman @ the well. Jesus told her that true worshippers worship 'in spirit and truth'. In other words, they don't put on shows for God. They come just as they are, which is the true definition of humility. And they come honestly. No lies. No emphasizing the positives and ignoring the negatives... you come as a child, just as you are. And rest in Him like Hebrews talks about. God has done the work sister so that you may abide in Him. Why? Because He wants you just as you are.   Remember, Jesus said, "My yoke is easy and "My burden is light" The Amplified says it well -  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...  Jesus is gentle and humble in heart and He won't be harsh with you. He may confront you at times but it won't bring a sense of shame.    Anyway, I don't try to be a good Christian anymore! I come to Him as a child, resting in His finished work, trusting Him to live His life through me and I must confess, I've had more fun with God than I have in a long time! And I'm becoming more Holy because He's making me so. He's even begin to heal me & refresh my heart in some really wonderful ways!    You are Blessed Sister for God IS with you because He wants to be with you! He loves you and wants you - just as you are!|`|OI29tkSoaa	It takes Faith & also to be strong|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    First, lets define the word "abide."  John 15:4 says, Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. The word abide, in this context is G3306 meno? men'-o  A primary verb; to stay (in a given place, state, relation or expectancy): - abide, continue, dwell, endure, be present, remain, stand, tarry (for), X thine own.    So then, how can we do this?  Have you ever heard the story of the Shepherd and the lamb?  Okay, well then...let me share it with you.  Once upon a time there was a young shepherd boy who tended his sheep.  He had one little lamb that would continually get into trouble.  He was always wandering off.  One day, the little lamb wandered off close to a pack of wolves.  The shepherd boy again, would leave his flock to rescue the little lamb.  This little lamb was endangering not just himself, but the rest of the flock.  While the shepherd was off looking for the lamb, the flock would be in danger.     So, the shepherd "broke" the legs of the little lamb and draped his little body around his neck.  For days, the little lamb lay around the neck of the shepherd boy.  Finally, the day came, the little lambs legs healed.  The shepherd boy gently lay the little lamb down on the ground.  The lamb sprung up on his legs and regained his balance.    The shepherd boy smiled and went off to tend the rest of the flock.  The little lamb NEVER left the shepherd boy's side after that.  Do you know why?  Because...while the little lamb lay around the shepherd boy's neck for days, he became accustom to his master's smell, body language, his touch, and ...his voice.    We too, get like the little lamb and wander off.  It is much better to stay as close as we can through "obedience" to the Master, Jesus Christ, than to spiritually get our legs broke.  There was a time when I wandered off, doing my own thing...and He broke my legs.  I would be foolish ...NOT to walk as close to my Master as possible.  I truly do not like His spiritual woodshed.  If you've ever experienced it...you don't ever want to go back.    Galatians 5 is a great place to start.|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	I need this same knowledge.

I read a saying once that makes a lot of sense:    "The pure and simple truth  is rarely pure and never simple."    When you use the word pure, I think of temptations.  Only the Lord Jesus was able to withstand   all temptations.  That is why He died on the   cross for us.  We ask for forgiveness, and   work on being more like Him.    Philippians 4:8 (New International Version)  Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirableif anything is excellent or praiseworthythink about such things.    Sorry, but I don't like sharing testimonies too much online.  Matthew 7:6   Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.    But e-mail me if I can share with you personally.  God bless!

This is the classic problem with applying logic without coming to a common agreement of the definition of the terms used in the argument.  It can lead you to an incorrect logical conclusion.      I hope this helps.|`|LhDde5iBaa	Great deductive thinking!    I so hate their music.
AsyB1qLyaa	I think if He showed Himself in all His glory, we couldn't comprehend it. So He uses means to reveal Himself. The Bible, prophets, apostles, other believers.

That sort of thing.|`|si3eq11haa	God wants everyone to find Him. did you ever play hide and seek with your parents? did they ever hide from you? i bet they deliberately left a foot, or an arm etc on show, so you could easily find them...

He loves you, why wouldn't He want you to find Him? when God calls you, you will know He is calling you. you will feel a longing for something that you may not fully understand. a restlessness for something you cant quite put your finger on. you will start questioning things, wondering..... that is God calling you. that is when you have to make a choice. will you answer His call, or will you ignore it, or ridicule it?  if you feel that maybe God is calling you now, answer Him, say "yes Lord?" ask Him to come into your life. you cant come unless He calls, when He calls, be ready to answer.|`|PcNzgisHaa	OMG!!

Nowhere in scripture does it say anything to back up this claim & is at the very most a false teaching of men...    Jesus himself said that he spoke to the Disciples in proverbs... but told them the time was coming when he'd speak to them plainly... which came after he was resurrected... he was their shepherd... they could not die or be killed while he was with them, protecting them... & he kept them safe until after he was resurrected at which time they then all understood & spoke about what they understood.    In Matthew, Mark, Luke, & John, they didn't fully understand, as according to Jesus' own words until after their understanding was opened...    & they weren't the Apostles until some time after the resurrection up to the time they were endued with power from on High...    From Acts through Revelation... they understood & spoke about what they understood, which is why Jesus said whoever believed on their words he prayed for them as he prayed for the Disciples. & whoever received & hears their words receives him, but whoever does not hear them, does not hear Jesus... So when they were called Apostles, they definitely understood, exactly who Jesus was... When they were called disciples, they did not fully understand... At least that's what Jesus says in the scriptures.    Not sure what others believe & teach, but you can certainly wrestle the scriptures to your own destruction, according to Peter.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no because jesus had not died on the cross yet    We are not talking about understanding the trinity    denying the trinity means a person would not be saved.    Jesus had to be God to die for the sins of mankind    If he was not then his death meant nothing and his sacrifice was useless.    Only a holy pure sacrifice could be used to take the sins of the people upon themselves.    If jesus was human and a created being then he was not that Holy pure sacrifice.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Becauth he had a terrible lithp...|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Those who deny the "trinity" cannot be saved?!?

RD1lLEnraa	He is the nephew of the Watch Tower's late president Fred Franz, Raymond was one of the members of the  Governing Body.      It seems odd to  me that "Jehovah's organization for today would have someone this "evil" on their governing board in the light that Jesus said He would not lose even one that was given to Him and that no one could pluck anyone out of His hand.  Ahh, I guess Jehovah did not count on the WT's ability to disfellow people      It seems to me that the Pharisee's saw themselves as "Jehovah's organization" in their time yet we see Jesus stateing seven 'woes' upon them, one for shutting the kingdom of heaven against people just as the WT does today by "allowing" only 144,000 to go.  (See Matt.23:13-39)      I noticed one answer states that Ray was lying.  Odd, the organization that tells us it is OK to lie when it suits their purpose has accused someone of lying when it exposes their lies.      Jesus IS the TRUTH and the only way to find eternal life is by Jesus Christ so...ditch the tower....and come to JESUS for salvation!|`|bXeHr69Vaa	he was one of the group that interpreted the bible to suit the agenda of the watchtower society, error ridden that it was i believe he realised the mistakes he made and left the organisation, there was also a frederich franz who only had limited knowledge of the greek language|`|oVHFz52Laa	He used to be Jehovah's Witness in a leadership position.

k1vdbpixaa	This is a very thoughtful post, and it's a shame that some have chosen to answer so flippantly, "it's none of your business".  And really, WHO CARES what the statistics are?  Do statistics determine what's right and wrong?  Millions of people take illegal drugs. Does that make it right?  Thousands find ways to drain you of your savings and take your home.  If even ONE were to do this, it would be wrong.  Correction: even if NO ONE did these things, it would be wrong!  And here we are talking about eliminating life from this earth, and still some say it's ok?  What's so tragic is that if we were talking about a dog whose puppies were ripped from her body, that person would be on the front page of the paper and all over the news.  And before anyone comments on this, understand the fact that NO common animal would foolishly cause the abortion of her own offspring.  They are not that stupid.  My personal opinion is that a person does NOT have the right to do whatever they want with their own body.  We are to act responsibly with anything that is charged to us, whether it be our own bodies or the bodies of those we have been given charge over.  If I choose to cut off any part of my body or do anything that would harm myself, you KNOW that all kinds of people would be sending me to shrinks and judges to determine my sanity and take over my personal affairs.  What a foolish statement, that poster should be ashamed.  I also have a big issue with people who say that "if it is not viable it's okay"; what about a child who is mentally retarded?  That child cannot think for himself, and is not viable. What about those on respirators?  They cannot breathe on their own.  How about comatose victims, they are totally helpless, but to kill them we would be charged with a crime.  Do we have the right to eliminate anything that we consider not "normal" ? And who makes the determination as to where to draw that line?  Hitler did the same thing back in the 40s.  And yet we choose to forget the implications of what he did, and justify our behavior just as foolishly and thoughtlessly as he did.  I don't care what you call it, a cell, a zygote, an embryo, or a fetus; it is a life.  It may not be breathing on its own, but it deserves the chance to live.  If a woman doesn't want it, she should put it up for adoption at birth to those whose hearts are aching for the very responsibility she chose to relinquish.  There is no excuse for eliminating the child just because the woman doesn't want it, no matter what the reason.  IF that child is not meant to live, God should make the determination, not YOU.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Here is a piece of irony: Science finds active living cells on  Mars, they call it life.

This is the mental disorder of liberal thinking.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	In those states that do recognize such actions as murder, the laws were put into place generally as a means to weaken abortion rights. By laying the groundwork for granting some level of rights to a fetus, they hope to get around the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v Wade. You will note that none of these states have laws that say if a mother smokes, drinks or engages in any sort of dangerous activity that leads to a miscarriage, she is guilty of manslaughter. If they actually considered fetuses to be deserving of the same rights and protections as human beings, they would have to do this. But, of course, they don't.    Any level of logic should tell you that it cannot rationally be considered to be murder. For there to be a murder, there has to be a person as the victim. Where is the person? What was the person's name, birth date, Social Security Number, eye color, etc etc? The "victim" in such a circumstance has nothing that would allow it to be considered a person. It is assault on the woman, but certainly not murder.|`|QlQYGlifaa	How would you like to be charged with actually robbing a bank because you had thought about doing it?

A person could be charged with murder for the death of unborn fetus if the state law so provides.  However, abortion is specifically excluded from the legal definition of murder since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade held that any law criminalizing abortions prior to viability of the fetus is unconstitutional.  The point is:  if a state law says that someone who kills a box turtle can be charged with murder, then it's considered murder.  If shooting your neighbor's dog does not constitute murder according to the language of the statute, then it is not murder.    But aside from the legal aspect of the issue, there is a significant difference between a woman causing the termination of her own pregnancy through an abortion and the death of an unborn fetus caused by the intentional misconduct of a third party.  Think about it this way:  someone who cuts off a woman's arm can be charged with assault and battery as well as a number of other crimes, but it is perfectly legal for a woman to cut off her arm herself.  The distinction is the woman's choice as to whether she wants to lose her arm or not.  Her pregnancy follows the same principle:  if she wanted to carry the fetus to term, then the early termination caused by the actions of another can be punishable by law, but if she does not want to keep the pregnancy, then she can terminate it herself prior to a certain point in time.      Probably the most important thing to understand is that, legally speaking, a fetus is not a citizen of the U.S., since it has not been born, and therefore it has no inherent "right to life" guaranteed by the Constitution.|`|l8N2uC6Iaa	Yes abortions are murder.  At conception the egg and sperm join and the zygote has unique DNA of a human person. Within 35 days, that zygote has become a fetus and has produced blood circulating from a beating heart.  That sounds like life to me.      We all do have choice though... but the problem is that people think that choice is after they get a positive pregnancy test.  The choice is when you decide to have sex.  You know the possibility exists that you could conceive a child so you decide whether to accept that possibility or not by your choice to have sex.      As to when it is punishable to kill the child... it all depends on intent right?  If you go have an abortion you know you are going to kill a child, your child.  But get kicked in the husband... was it to cause bodily harm to the child?  If yes then prosecution is warranted.|`|xZet9Dunaa	yes it is against one of God's commandants Thou shalt not kill|`|M6vUJ5bBaa	YES !! Absolutely and Positively. Life begins at conception, and if any person will destroy a fetus, they WILL be held accountable when they stand before God in judgment. According to my King James Bible in Isaiah 49:1 The Lord hath called me from the womb: from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. In the book of Job 31:15 Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us within our mothers? Finally, In Psalms 139:13-14 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb, I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made, that was from King David's mouth. So you see, you and I are right when we say abortion is murder.|`|Xb0GiTMuaa	Yes.    "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet   unto the nations."  Jeremiah 1:5 (KJV)|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	Abortion is not murder. Murder, according to the dictionary is  the unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice. Unlawful means what is not lawful; illegal. For abortion to be murder, it must first of all be illegal ( which it is not) and second of all be a premeditated act of hate ( which it also is not). A man who beats his pregnant partner should be charged with abuse. Not murder.     Because the man is not charged with murder, as it is not murder, your second paragraph is not logically sound.     The reasons behind an abortion are no ones business but the woman's'. I do not have the right to tell another human what to do with their body, or anything that resides inside of their body. The government does not have that right. You might not agree with abortion, but that does not make it murder. If you do not like them, if you cannot approve of them then you do not have to support them, but you do not have to try to push your opinions on other people or try to make them a societal norm.

They fight wars, commit crimes, pollute the environment, often carry on business in a manner motivated by greed rather than concern for their fellowman, and sometimes indulge in habits that they know can be harmful to their health.

We allowed the banks and corporations to act the way to do for years now with not 1 person taking a stand against them. Greed has gripped this nation with such a tight hold, it's almost hard to catch a breathe.    Not until we realize that money is not everything in this world, that no one is any better than the next, and that we are ALL connected - will we be able to fix this issue once and for all.      On a personal note - I have been a bit complacent in my job as of late. I know the economy is bad, but where I live we hadn't really been that effected. And, I work for an oil and gas company - so I figured I was safe.   I was a bit off on that. Today, we have and are still having lay-offs. My boss, a director, was let go along with one other person from my department. I'm still safe - for now. But, this has caused me to open my eyes and bit and realize that we are all in this together and it - well, SUCKS!!!!|`|FmazIF6Maa	No, they are a result of   - some natural trends   - a couple of natural disasters  - the house of representatives pushing for lowering loan restrictions making it easier for people who cannot afford houses and credit to get it  - Bush not being as fiscally conservative as he should have been as a Republican|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	As long as we keep creating problems and then blaming the gods, we will never learn from our mistakes.

It's all greed.  It's stupid homeowners, thinking their houses would continue appreciating 20% a year, allowing them to pay down their massive credit cards that are maxed out due to unbridled spending.    Top that off with dumb-*** banks, who hopped on the appreciation bandwagon, thinking it would never end, giving unchecked loans to everyone with a pulse, even if it was thready.    What is God teaching me?  I've never carried a balance on a credit card and my house will be paid off in half the time of the original mortgage.  Why is * my * 401K in the crapper?    Nope.  It's all due to greed.

Initially worn by choice, its wearing was enforced in Europe after 1215 for adult male Jews to wear while outside a ghetto in order to distinguish Jews from others.

7edb005fffc860fa080393ebd8da2e72aa	There are two types of Indian people - one who would strictly follow "Be a Roman in Rome" and the one who would rather die than being americanised. All the stereotypes and generalizations that you mentioned wholly apples to the latter. I hope your guy doesn't come under this category. But having said that, I will have to admit that you still cannot raise this question since its completely personality dependent. I'm one Indian guy who is interested only in white women unlike my other Indian friends. So as you said, we can't generalize Indian men or any community for that matter. The best bet is to ask this question directly to the guy.|`|76Wp8OINaa	I'm totally approving of this, I'm 1/16 Native American (Not enough to be officially declared as one), so I wouldn't be posting this if something like your situation didn't happen.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	My sister (white) is married to an american-indian guy and both families are fully supportive!|`|r5c20sY1aa	put it this way  my guys parents who are also indian want to kill me...would prefer if I just dropped off the earth without their assistance but if this keeps up they may just put their two cents worth in.

R76ema39aa	Muslim belief is that Jesus did not die 2000 or so years ago on the cross as Christians believe.   He was raised into heavens, it was not him on the cross, and he didn't die. And so nearing the Day of Judgment, we believe he will return to Earth from the heavens.   He will live in peace for about 40 years and then he will eventually die a natural death.   Then on the Day of Judgment we will all be raised back up (including all the Prophets) from the dead, and our deeds will be judged.    EDIT:   1) I'm female. Not Mr, but Miss     2) I'll find out the direct translation for you and edit it in. But havent you already stated the meaning?     3) What on Earth are you talking about??   It was not adapted from christianity. Christianity, Islam and Judiasm are ALL abrahamic religions! They DO have a lot of similarities. But go and ask any Islamic scholar if you don't believe me - and i don't mean through the internet. Litterally go to a mosque and ask some people about all of the questions you have.     The main difference between Christianity and Islam about Jesus is the fact that muslims do not believe him to be God or the Son of God. They believe him to be a great prophet and a great man.     I assure Islam DOES teach about the coming back of Jesus. Islam teaches about Jesus not being killed on the cross, and so will return, live for 40 years, and then die a natural death. - Which he has not done so yet.    EDIT:   You dont have to call me "miss". What i said above was just to show i'm female.   Anyways i suggest you check out this link, the first half talks a little about the returning of Jesus in the Quran.     http://en.allexperts.com/q/Islam-947/Isa...    And another which has information on the verse you mentioned;  http://www.womaninthequran.com/02.html    I hope they answer some of your questions.     Anyways, brother to be completely honest with you i am not going to pretend to be the most knowledgable person about Islam - They are many people who know more then me. - But i am hoping to keep increasing my knowledge of Islam (And other religions). So i'm trying to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge - which i admit is limited. So i apologise if i can't give you answers your looking for. - It's not because they don't exist - i just honestly don't know.     So my advice to you would be, go visit a mosque and talk to some brothers there about the religion. - Ask them any question you want to. If they don't know i'm sure they will try and find out for you. And 99% if the they will be someone who knows the answer. And talking to someone face to face would also be better then through the internet.     And i also wanted to mention, though the book is the word of God, they are also hadiths. Which are sayings of the Prophet (SAW). The main schools of thought base all their rulings on the Quran, the Hadith, Ijmah (consenses of the ulamah), and qiyas (comparing it to another situation at the time of the Prophet).

yN3fWUCuaa	An interesting question, but if God exists, it would stand to reason that said God is infinite.  If that is not the case, then said God was created.   If He was not created, but has simply "been", then it would seem all ability should be measured by that being's abilities.    Is He limited by His own nature?  The only logical answer is "yes", but, again, assuming this one God is infinite, it is a nature by which everything else is measured.|`|eomrfXrzaa	God doesn't exist and you know it.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Think about this,...

I wouldn't pay too much attention to what the prophets said in the bible with regards to what God told them!    I do believe that God does speak to individuals today, but those individuals aren't egoistic and they show diplomacy and humility and have no desire to tell the world that they are a prophet of God.    God is beyond human emotions and superficial conditions.  Whether you believe in God or not, be certain that the 'religious' god is an imposter made by mankind.

God is all powerful    he does not break or go back on his word    breaking of the law demands punishment    If he was not all powerful then he would not be able to stop satan nor judge him and lock him up in the lake of fire for all eternity.    God has free will to do as he pleases    He will never do anything that goes against his nature    Just as you can never do anything against your nature    you can not breath any thing other then oxygen.    To do so goes against your nature.  to say because you can not breath any thing other then oxygen means you have no free will is not logical.    You have free will to make choices with in your nature  You can not make a choice to fly since you are bound by gravity  To say because I can not fly means I have no free choice is not logical.    Just because you have free will does not mean you will be able to make choices that go against your nature.    you have free will but can not choose to breath under water or fly or leap off a cliff because its against your nature.    God has free will to carry out his will.  nothing stops him. He can not go against his nature, he can not lie, can not do evil since he is Holy and pure. No punishing the wicked and sending them to hell is not evil its justice.    just as when the law sends a murderer to jail for either life or executes them. They are adminstering justice not doing evil.|`|AA11946554	Or, God simply does not exist ;-)  The leaders of the Israeli tribe needed everyone to stick together so they made up a character that supposedly could see everything they did, even if they could sneak past the main guys and was powerful enough to punish them.

I don't believe the Buy-bull is a bunch of fairy tales...I know it's a bunch of stories by control freaks.  Edit: The Buy-bull says we are made in his image. Then why the hell can't we understand the concept of an all-powerful, all-knowing creator being 'loving' us but LETTING or MAKING terrible things happen?

Can God be here and there at the same time?  Can He be then and now at the same time?  Yes, He can, because He does not dwell in space and time as human beings.  Of course, this concept is impossible for us to wrap our arms around because we are so limited by our flesh.  God is eternal, but for God every moment is the same moment.  He was, is and will be.  He is the great I AM.  This means that He doesn't live according to a calendar or hold an address.  He is in every moment as He has always been and will always be.      So, when it comes to prayer, does it matter?  If God already knows what will be, how will prayer change anything?  And if God changes His mind, is He being true to His nature?  Wouldn't He already know what was|`|Mri4D4m2aa	Yes. God the creator of this universe has framed rules and made it binding on itself. Love of God for the human beings is a satisfaction that humans have invented for themselves to express their compliance with the rules that they can hardly alter. God neither loves nor hates like humans. Prayer is expression of the helpless seeking the support of the all powerful. God has endowed humans with mind and intelligence and all the more with consciousness. Mind helps in having desires and intelligence helps in fulfilling those. While fulfilling the humans are supposed to comply with the eternal principles that guarantees harmony with nature. Then one becomes entitled for the Nature's bliss. Bliss is God and God is bliss.

Feeling good and being comfortable . . . but that is how the Opposer wants you to feel . . . now, you are no longer seeking truth but think you are now free from bondage, saved forever and have no worries (unscriptural).     Christ NEVER taught us that we must feel good, be comfortable, feel free from danger or even to relax.    One needs ALWAYS to be seeking truth, making sure of the important things and testing whether what we are taught/read/understand is consistant with the Bible and the light being make brighter every day as we close in on the end.    Being comfortable may be a place of danger!|`|iKmkRaqBaa	Christianity aims to such purpose.

Not that anybody will read my response since it's been 12 hours since you asked your question; but I happen to agree that you and Einstein are really on to something.     If I were an atheist my life would be all about me.  Sadly, most of my Christian life has been about me.  A few years I discovered some things about myself that only God could have revealed.  My point?  I find that my life is the most fulfilling when I'm living it for others.  Jesus was all about selflessness, atheism is all about selfishness.  A friend of mine said he had read somethings in the satanic bible and it boiled down to this: Live life for you!  What ever you can do to get ahead, do it!  If others have to get hurt or even die for your personal gain, so be it.      Though many of God's principles seem backwards, they really DO work.  MY life is fulfilled when I live it for others.  if I want more, I need to GIVE, not hoard.  God's laws and plans work, all you have to do is try them.    And lastly, no, Christianity has NOT been boring.  One of my life's motto's is, "My life is a lot of things, but boring isn't one of them."  I hear so many people say that they don't want to become a Christian because they can't have fun anymore.  Oh, if only they knew how wrong they really were!|`|4cRKwYfoaa	Because God-All-Powerful is real and he is on your side.|`|2f05f1797218d6d460cdf8e06af0c251aa	UM, so you are saying you have to be christian to enjoy skiing and playing sports?|`|r5U3JLBwaa	To be honest, no i dont feel this way.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	No attacks from me.

6eqJSffkaa	That's quite some question. I'll attempt to answer it as best I can.  I've been meditating for years and in the last three or so its become more natural to experience spiritual essence. Other people probably have a different experience and perspective on this. For myself as I go through life I no longer feel like a separate entity struggling in an unloving world, now I feel connected up to the essence that I share with all that is.

sWLRSa6Caa	We have been so cleverly progammed to the voice of the ego that we cannot recognize the chaos it produces in our lives, though we do know we aren't happy, except for a moment here and there.  We have been well-trained away from our Truth so that, even with the desire to remember, much stripping away of the false voice and its false teachings is required.  It is not only a matter of deconstructing our own life, but it is also a matter of undoing the entrenched conditioning of the multitudes of generations that came before us, back to the beginning of all humanity. This is not an easy task.    So when we hear the first whisper of the voice for God, it is as though we are entering into a foreign land where we do not understand the language or the culture.  It takes some time to begin to translate from the voice of the false ego to the voice of Truth.  The process is a lengthy one requiring many shifts in our consciousness, with each one moving us closer to the final and glorious shift.  But from beginning to end of this process, patience is required...because we do not know what we are doing.  We must learn to trust, turning away from the only thing we've ever known, and surrender ourselves to a higher knowing that is moving us gently toward Home.    Remembrance is the final miracle in a series of miracles that have slowly been removing the ancient way of thinking from our minds and retraining us to align with Source...not just partially, or now and then, or when we think to do it...but once and for all.    Desire is the antithesis of remembrance, for it not only creates its own resistance, but it is what separated us from Source in the first place...out of the desire to be independent, individual creators.  If we ask to remember, that is all we need do...we will be guided with lovingkindness to Light and to Love, but not in human time or terms, for these have long failed us.  Rather, we will be shown our errors, the way in which we have pled allegiance to the separated ego, and how to dismantle its illusion.  We cannot presume to understand how deeply ingrained our conditioning is or the subtlety that is required to undo the complexity of the ego's thought system.     Deep trust and humble patience are the only ways to cooperate with our retooling.  The human mind can hardly fathom the complex intricacies of unweaving the web we ourselves have made and that Spirit must remove to reclaim us from our dream of separation.  Impatience will only delay our journey to wholeness, for impatience rings loudly of distrust and lingering self-righteousness.    We have been promised ultimate realization and, considering this, it is already completed, though we ourselves are unaware.  There is nothing to do but to listen for the inner voice for God and to wholeheartedly comply with Its whispered guidance.  We must let go and let God.     i am Sirius|`|500d6fc36eb98b82443dc02f01ab5214aa	As we grow learning all we need to learn from our experiences, we will let go many memories for the more new important memories. The most important memories come from feelings, emotions, especially love, because love never dies, it can be felt from many past life times. I know it's true, because when I was a child I felt it, was the reason why I would watch love movies as a young child. And it all came together for me when the woman spirit came to me in my hour of need five years ago, and stayed with me for four years. But as I reflect back, as a child and seeing spirits since age four, I know and she did say that she will always be there with me through it all. So I know the feelings of love was a remembrance, especially when she helped me to remember some details of two past life times:)|`|Oxbq2uJtaa	It is only through seeing all the other ways my fellow mankind see, and how I have seen that I can then really see beyond what I say before.  Too see, to open the mind, to let go is to open.  I let go of my beliefs even in order to see, I let go of my knowledge, in order to see, I let go of even desire in order to see, but it was desire that led me to dropping all that is of me.       But what of having children in this world and living daily, with remembrance or in it?  How do we ensure they keep their teeth, are well fed,  warm and know what to do when encounter other human beings in this world.  We are trapped by a system of survival.  What a dream.      If in remembrance we could daily make progress towards changing this system to something that worked better in unity for the earth and all here.  How we  treat each other every day is the key?  And perhaps how we treat ourselves within this trap.    Thank you for all your thoughtful answers all the time.

As we grow up we're influenced by whatever beliefs our parents hold (not just on spiritual matters), and if they don't believe in God or have conflicting views that as well influences a child. Our experiences start shaping our beliefs, our character, our goals and desires for the future. According to whatever statistic you read it seems like everyone has a mental illness. Some might, but for the most part it's probably the stress of life, circumstances we're dealing with, experiences we've had, and the way we think that contributes to a less than desired quality of life. What blocks us? Basically ourselves (how we think, who we think we are, how we view life and our future).    For those who actually desire a deeper relationship with God, faulty beliefs and even the circumstances of life can be huge mountains in the way. What makes it worse is sometimes it takes a long time to trudge up one mountain and when you look at the horizon there are many more mountains in the way, and that can be disheartening and influence one to lose faith.|`|cByRtCC9aa	Guilt is what blocks us.

It only seems difficult because we "forget" that remembrance is always only here now. Nothing blocks our path. We just get all wrapped up in getting somewhere or some-when else.    The mind takes a word like remembrance and generates a concept that is adopted as a goal by the ego. This goal is always projected out there somewhere away from where "I am". In this way the mind turns it into a lie.    Desire keeps you from your goal. Desire is the minds way of keeping you attached to a future that does not exist. There is no fantastic magical absolute spiritual truth somewhere out there in future; EVERYTHING is right here now.|`|K7LbNlNjaa	Ah, thank you Phae, for asking a much needed question!!

Our faith is the one faith that has always lived peaceably in the world. We do not seek to destroy or harm those who do not practice what we believe. With the increased attacks on our faith, I'm not surprised why the question isn't asked as to why so many are attacking and insulting our faith. I personally have witnessed more anger at Christianity coming from other religions or atheists. Christianity is the only religion where presently it's followers are being persecuted in some way for simply following Christ. They are many in other parts of the country being killed or beaten or jailed for doing nothing! This is however ignored by many in society. Our faith is belittled, ridiculed, or slandered by many, and yet this is not something that many seem to  recognize.    Christianity is a faith-based relationship with Jesus Christ, the Savior; it is not a religion. We are saved by grace given of God, and have been spiritually reborn, but we still have our emotions and personality that are daily being conformed to the image of Christ. We are not perfect or faultless. I believe the reason you feel this way is because of the way Christianity is being largely misrepresented in western society by many mainstream churches. There is an apostasy taking place presently, as the scriptures said would happen just before the rapture of the true church and the judgements of God. They are warned in Rev. 2-3 to repent of their ways; but the true church remains faithful to Christ, although we are a small remnant remaining.   Jesus Christ was sent of God to reveal the truth that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that no man can come to the Father except through being born again in the salvation freely given through Him. This truth should not offend, but bring joy to know that God loved us so much that He would give His only begotten Son to sacrifice His life for the sins of mankind. We are to love our neighbors as ourselves, and that includes giving the truth of the gospel to them that they might be saved. There are many that will be offended because this goes against living your life your own way and by your own wisdom, but God bless those who realize the blessedness of a restored life to God through salvation in Christ. He who gives his life for the sake of Christ Jesus and the gospel will find life eternal. It has been prophecied in the scriptures that in these latter days, Christianity would have little influence just before her redemption in rapture, because He will allow the wickedness of man to increase before coming to an end.   In the end, man will see that it is God who has all wisdom, strength, and power, when His wrath is revealed, and Christ Jesus returns in great power, glory, and majesty as King of Kings! I am sorry for your great misunderstanding of the Christian faith and pray that you will truly seek to understand the truth, for those who TRULY seek God will find Him in truth. This is not the end of all things. True righteousness will reign when Jesus Christ returns. Please do not let that deter you from finding true faith in Jesus Christ alone.|`|el8yX5q3aa	It is?

You say that you know what the bible says but you obviously don't believe it, otherwise you would not expect it to change, move forward and grow - as you put it.    I DO believe the teachings of the bible and it states that Jesus is the ONLY way, therefore others are NOT valid. The bible says that God does not change so He is not going to do so just to please you.    You speak of Christianity attacking others. Are you wearing blinkers? Can you not see that the most discriminated against religion is Christianity. It is not only discriminated against by other religions but by secular governments all over the world and even some that 'claim to be' Christian.    In some places churches are being forced to employ homosexuals and muslims. Pastors are being imprisoned for preaching that homosexuality is wrong etc. Christians are being killed for their faith in non-Christian countries. In which Christian countries do you hear of people of other religions being killed for their faith? Where do Christians commit suicide and kill hundreds of other innocent people in the process?

If you base your perception of reality on what you read on this and other web blogs, you are missing out on real life.  In case you hadn't noticed, the majority of respondents on this site are atheists.  They make comments constantly about how science has proven there is no God and how Christianity has been proven false (often based on 3rd century gnostic texts and novels written in the last couple centuries like the DaVinci Code).  If my answers attempt to point out the naive ignorance of these views, it is not because I am insecure in my belief, but because I can not comprehend how anyone can hold such views as those unless they have closed their eyes and minds to the reality of life.  As for your view that all religious beliefs have equal validity, I would argue that such a view basically gives validity to none of them.  How can there be one God and many?  How can Jesus be God's son, sent to save us from our sins, and be just a prophet and teacher or not even have existed at all.  I have faith in the God who created mankind, not a god who was created by mankind.  I have faith in the historical Jesus Christ who was who he claimed to be - the son of God.  I do not persecute people of other faiths.  I do not belittle them and call them names (as some of the devout atheists on this site do).  I do believe they are wrong and I will always tell them what I believe is the truth, but it is up to each person to choose their path in life.|`|LyZtCe4Faa	The Christian religion has become insecure because so many scientific findings and theories challenge the very base of their beliefs.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	i was not aware my faith became insecure.        -Christian|`|2f05f1797218d6d460cdf8e06af0c251aa	because its too broad and not all 'christians' believe the same thing and its all being disproven anyway

But the name of their God is Yahweh(Hebrew) or Jehovah(English).   God is like a title not a name,in islam he is known as allah while others have there own concepts and derivations!  and surely we believe that Allah is the Allah of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob......its just that he is known by different names!|`|IqqaA2wIaa	apparently yes.....HIS NAME is Almightry Trinity...|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	Yes, that what they have been taught. BUT, regardless of *how* those prophets worship, there's a HUGE truth that Muslims conveniently forget: Islam was founded by the Prophet Muhammad around the year 610 AFTER Jesus, and it's a proven historical fact that before the Prophet Muhammad founded Islam, they were all "pagans".  So, to say that the biblical prophets were Muslim is to say that they were pagans......brilliant!|`|lPQu5Uzpaa	You already know that one dork!!
XAIiOFkXaa	Muslims believe that Ishmael was the one chosen by God whereas Judaism and Christianity believes that it was Isaac who became Israel. To be fair to Muslims it is written in Genesis that God did say that as Ishmael was a son of Abraham he would father a great nation. It is also written in the Bible that ( Ishmaelites bought Joseph as a slave from his brothers and sold him in Egypt) Ishmaelites must have become a nation in prehisory  Muhommed must have been an Ishmaelite. Muslims believe that Muhommed fulfilled the promise of God in the same way that Christians believe that Jesus did that.  Ishmaelism must be to Islam what Judaism is to Christianity|`|sZLdWABcaa	I'm 15 and half muslim and half christian muslims believe that abraham was a muslim so was jesus. and Muhammed did write the koran but god revelated it to him.|`|VW1ekTb3aa	During Muhammed time, people were worshipping idels. He rejected that and he believed that his God and everyone's God is the ONE and is the ONE who created all this universe. He used to go to the montain and meditate and think of the one who created the universe. When time came, Quran was revealed to him through the Angel Gabriel during 23 years. How can he write the Quran when he DID NOT know how to read or write. He was taught about Islam and all other prophets and messengers, who all were sent in different times to guide people with revelations sent to them from God Almighty.    The first Surah was revealed to him is the following:    In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful    Read: In the name of thy Lord Who createth, (1) Createth man from a clot. (2) Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous, (3) Who teacheth by the pen, (4) Teacheth man that which he knew not. (5) Nay, but verily man is rebellious (6) That he thinketh himself independent! (7) Lo! unto thy Lord is the return. (8) Hast thou seen him who dissuadeth (9) A slave when he prayeth? (10) Hast thou seen if he relieth on the guidance (of Allah) (11) Or enjoineth piety? (12) Hast thou seen if he denieth (Allah's guidance) and is froward? (13) Is he then unaware that Allah seeth? (14) Nay, but if he cease not We will seize him by the forelock - (15) The lying, sinful forelock - (16) Then let him call upon his henchmen! (17) We will call the guards of hell. (18) Nay, Obey not thou him. But prostrate thyself, and draw near (unto Allah). (19)     All prophets and messengers were muslims, because ISlam means submission to the ONE God Almighty.|`|bkuFxvkcaa	Good question, I would like to know this as well. I have yet to find this anywhere.|`|56buyQZ1aa	because first was the judaism than the christanity and THEN the islam.  soo muhammed looked at the bible and wrote the koran|`|R94jY6mAaa	Qur'an  *|`|AA10703301	Who says that Abraham is Jewish?  And he defiantly isn't Christian with a cross.    He is the father of the prophets, including Mohammed.    If Mohammed toke the Qur'an from the bible can you tell me which one, there isn't one bible that we can believe is the original. And since no original bible, why isn't IT been taken from the ORIGINAL Qur'an that we have in its original language.     Also if Mohammed has taken the Qur'an from the missed up and lost bible, why did he give a different explanation to the beginning of the world, and emphasizing the BIG BANG?|`|3GO5k5nNaa	Hi there, its good that you are at least asking the questions.    From an Islamic viewpoint, we believe that the only religion that was revealed by God is Islam. Islam means 'submission to the will of God'. It is not named after a personality or place like every other mainstream religion. So, one that submits to god (i.e Islam) is a Muslim. So, Abraham was a Muslim.    Further to your additional questions, why comtemplate the oneness of God before the Quran was revealed. We believe in both revelation and reason, the human being knows its true nature without all the verses being revealed.     Further, there were many people who believed in God at the time and did not worship idols. They were following Abrahamic treaching, however, most people has lost their way.    Jesus (Peace be Upon Him) is mentioned 25 times in the Quran. Which verse are you referring to you?    - That he spoke as an infant (a miracle from God)  - That Allah says "Do not say three"   - That the similitude of Jesus is like that of Adam....    My brother, you should mention your reference, if you are to make a claim.

AA11668191	Human sacrifice is what Christianity is all about. You don't get it, and probably never will.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	God is not under necessity in the Creation or the Redemption, that is an axiom of all theology. SO you are wrong there.     Human sacrifice was a major reason the Canaanites were exterminated. SO you are wrong there too.     GOd is not separate from Jesus !!!! At least stick by the Christian Faith if you are going to ridicule it. You are picturing God wrangling with Jesus ! No, sorry. All decisions ad extra of the Trinity are in utter unity. Another axiom.     Finally though Scotus and Aquinas (who represent the two major Catholic schools of thought on Jesus and the Atonement) differ, they absolutely agree on one thing, that the slightest act of Jesus, a sigh even, would have sufficed for the salvation of all the world.    So you are stupidly uninformed.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	"The wages of sin is DEATH- but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." You have to remember, it should be us that are tortured but instead Jesus Himself came down to die in our place.  It was not the nails that kept Him on the Cross, it was love for you and me.

Thankfully we dont have to go through that.|`|LYPWNxx5aa	If she makes it to heaven, she will be surrounded by the unconditional love that you apparently do not have for her.|`|ykImIiTwaa	God eventually saves all of us from sin and punishment and shares His complete happy experience of eternity with everyone...      God reconciles all to Himself through Jesus Christ, Who makes peace through His shed blood and crucifixion (Col 1:20). Jesus is the Lamb of God Who takes away all the sins of all the world (Jn 1:29). The creation itself, also, shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the glorious freedom of the children of God (Rom 8:21).    Hell's punishment is not forever but until the end of the eons - eonian punishment. People don't sin enough during their mortal lives for God to choose endless punishment besides it would spoil the future of eternity to have a section continually reserved for endless torture...    People are made by God to rebel against His ideal will for them and then offered a choice - forgiveness of their rebellion, or, punishment for their sins until they have paid the last 'penny'... After punishment, those who went through torture in hell come to realise they need faith on God to succeed in life and they are converted into God's kingdom so that they cease from sinning and are rewarded for their compliance...      There are two bible translations which uphold the doctrine of Universal Reconciliation with God, and the union of all beings into experience of God as the all in each of us. For a free download of these bibles you can try this website:  http://www.scripture4all.org/    An outline of the bible references which support Christian Universalism has been posted at this webpage:  http://uk.geocities.com/timpauloconnor@b...|`|AA11849917	And yet, you remain an atheist, knowing full well that your mother is grieved over you.

Why wouldn't the atheist son want to join her?|`|KnZ0FpkFaa	When we die if are souls are not good enough, it is almost like a cross between Groundhog day with bill murray when he keeps reliving the same day over and over. That mixed in with a little quantum leap. We relive our lives over and over almost like it was a cd and someone pressed the repeat button until our souls got better.  (= Hell 2.0)    For the automatically good souls, or the ones that went through reliving a few times, their consciousness would entangle itself around a newly born universe. The physical manifestation of the multiverse (most beautiful woman ever) meets you. (She gave birth to you.) (she is a main part of what God is, the multiverse itself is the other part) Through meditation you learn how to manipulate the universe your soul has connected with and you can do pretty much whatever you want in that universe, and teach the life you create to be good.  (=heaven)

But that has nothing to do with your point at all. A person who truly deserved prison would not be a person to be good just by the accident of someone else's having them baptized. Think what you are saying. Are you attributing magic to being a Christian. It appears so.Were we to stipulate that they had ever consciously tried to be Christian that would make the offense even worse.     If you look at it logically, you would say x% of Christians don't live up to their commitment and these are more likely to end up in prison.    You have this all contorted. More than 95% of demons were angels. What does that say about angels. -- NOT A THING. You need a big damn logic lesson.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	That's cool !

If these men in prison were Christians what Bible were they reading then they stabbed someone to death or raped someone?    Maybe your question should say. Why do some many people claim to be Christians when there not?    If Pat Robertson was put in Prison then you would not see the population in Christians in Prison rise.

I know of two Christians in Prison, Kent Hovind and his wife look him up.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I think statistics are biased and I don't really trust them.    That being said, a lot of them claim to be Christian because of the advantage it offers them.    Some claim to be Christian, because then they can blame their crimes on Satan. Again, passing the buck.    And some probably believe, because no matter how heinous the crime, the general idea is, if you repent and are truly sorry for what you've done, you get into heaven anyway. It gives them some hope that they will one day be "free" of their actual prison and get to enjoy Paradise.    I find if funny that some people are answering "they must not be Christians since they are in prison." I thought that we all sin, and some sinners are just worse than others?    Just because they are "bad" doesn't mean you can disown them. That wouldn't be very Christian now would it?

2wUvFmrhaa	Big Love is not accurate of a mormon life.    Today...  THE LDS church believes in spiritual polygamy for Heaven. If a mormon man has a wife that dies he can be resealed and have them both as wives in their heaven. Do you see?    Dallin Oaks is a spiritual polygamist. He has two women sealed to him. The is done everyday in mormon temples around the WORLD.  Lets do some research.    Many mormon men are. I knew of two myself while a member.    Plus they believe, all the polygamy (each family) of the past dwelling together forever in the own rhelm. Procreating forever.    Sealing (polygamous ones too) are forever to them, if all remain faithful.    So they believe in the polygamy of the past and that sealings last forever, even if the man has TWO or mormon sealings. (today)|`|ZEc9UhJmaa	There was a time that mormons practiced polygamy, as explained by others already.  However, it is actually not doctrine that there will be polygamy in the afterlife.  Some people believe it, but you will not find it in mormon doctrine.  As for what happens to polygamist families after death--I'm not really sure.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	The Associated Press Stylebook [states that] Mormon is a nickname that should be applied exclusively to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that it is not accurately applied to any other person or organization (see entries on Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The and Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints).      The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recognizes that the prosecution of polygamist Warren Jeffs is generating substantial media coverage and that Jeffs group refers to its members as fundamentalist Mormons. That is causing problems for reporters trying to help their readers, viewers and listeners distinguish between Jeffs followers and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.     In the public mind, the word Mormon has come to mean something very specific. It conjures up images of Mormon missionaries on bikes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Mormon temples. It has become a synonym for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Consequently, when Mormon is used to describe polygamist groups, it causes great confusion about our beliefs among the general public and frustration to our members, which number over 12 million worldwide.     Polygamists and polygamist organizations that occasionally make the news are not dissident wings of the Church or fundamentalists. They have no affiliation whatsoever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Most of their members have never had any association with the Church either.     It follows that because Warren Jeffs is not affiliated with the Mormon church, and since he is not Mormon, reporters should look for more accurate and less misleading descriptions of him in the media. For example, Court TVs Web page never once used the word Mormon to describe Warren Jeffs in its story entitled Prosecutors to present evidence against polygamist leader Warren Jeffs in teen-bride case.     We sometimes hear the argument that because Jeffs and his followers use the Book of Mormon they should be considered Mormons. However, Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, evangelicals and a host of other faiths believe in Jesus and claim the Bible as their own, yet all consider themselves separate and distinct faiths.     The same is true for all religious groups who believe in Joseph Smiths prophetic calling and use the Book of Mormon. For example, the Community of Christ church claims Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon but changed its name from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to be recognized as a different faith.     Perhaps the following points will be helpful in your media coverage:     ? Warren Jeffs has never been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members are often referred to as Mormons.     ? Polygamy was officially discontinued in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1890. Any Church member adopting the practice today is excommunicated. Those groups which continue the practice in Utah and elsewhere have no association whatever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and most of their practitioners have never been among our members.     ? The Church has long been concerned about the continued illegal practice of polygamy, and in particular about reports of child and wife abuse emanating from polygamous communities today.     ? Even in countries where civil or religious law allows polygamy, the Church teaches that marriage must be monogamous and does not accept into its membership those practicing plural marriage.     Thank you for your time and attention|`|WyICbuPqaa	Mormons believe in the principle of polygamy, when it is commanded of God.  Polygamy was practiced in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.  In fact it was practiced by the Jews until about 1100 AD.  Many people don't realize that the parable about the ten virgins is about polygamy.    The practice has been suspended by the main group of Mormons out of deference to law.  The United States of America was willing to go to war to stop polygamy, but the saints weren''t willing to shed blood to keep it.  The laws passed by congress were cold hearted in the extreme.  They passed a law preventing men from financially supporting their wives and families who had moved out, and then another law preventing anyone who believed in polygamy from voting.  The suffering of the many women and children fell on deaf ears, as the congress sought to punish the Mormons for exercising their religious freedom.  It wasn't America's finest hour.    Jacob, a prophet in the Book of Mormon, taught that polygamy was wrong, unless it was commanded of God.  He believed his people to be unworthy to practice it, as they treated their wives poorly, and were breaking their hearts.  In the church, married men were actually called to marry other women who had no other means of support.  Through polygamy, all women can be provided for.  Every women could enjoy the blessings of motherhood.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Because some people need to use religion to justify their own (otherwise) inexcusable actions.

We all believe in it, all Christians should. Even biblical prophets practiced polygamy.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Religion claimed to have a revelation from God that Mormon men were meant to have multiple wives so they can have a lot of children. It was controversial from the start. His revelation was kept a secret for many years and just he and the top mormon leaders knew about it and kept wives in secret. One justification he said was that it would stop a man from cheating on his wife if he could just marry every young girl he wanted to have sex with.     This policy caused a lot of disruption among his followers and even more with non-mormons who thought they were a bunch of crazy sex freaks.     The Mormons got kicked out of Missouri and bounced around a lot until they ended up in Utah where there basically wasn't anyone else around to kick their rears anymore.     When Utah applied for statehood, they were forced to give up their believe in polygamy in order to join. But many small factions of Mormons kept with the tradidition and still do, to this day.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	Sloppy seconds...ukk!|`|AA11109467	First you have to understand that the Mormons believe that prophecy is alive and well and resides in certain of their church's elders.    Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, said he had a vision. God told him to take plural wives just as the patriarchs of the Old Testament had done, so he and the male converts, obedient to God, did so.    Later, long after Smith's demise, when the Mormons, settled in Utah Territory wanted statehood, they learned that it wasn't gonna happen unless they eschewed plural marriage.    Fortuitously, their then prophet had a vision, in which God told him that from then on, plural marriage would not be condoned by the church. So the church put out the word, the men released their wives and within a couple of years they got their statehood. Everybody happy.    Except for those extra wives who had a tough time of it and some of the males who flatly refused to accept that this prophecy was a true one. So they split from the main body of Mormonism and kept their spare females, yea verily, even unto today.    Mainstream Mormons consider them heretics and decry their practices.    Hope this helped.|`|bfP9vz9Naa	In the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints 58th chapter and 21st verse "Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land."  This revelation was given to Joseph Smith in 1831 one year after the church was founded and many years before any polygamy was practiced.    Currently it is against US law to practice polygamy, those who practice it are breaking the law and are acting contrary to the revelations of God.    Early in the history of the church, when it was legal, and in the ancient church, polygamy was practiced.  Famous prophets such as Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, had multiple wives.  It is important to understand that in this doctrine they were wives, they were loved, and supported, they were not sex slaves.|`|AA10637643	Mormons - Latter-day Saints - do not currently practice polygamy.  It was practiced at one time, by very few members and only for a short while.  There have been off-shoots of the LDS church that still practice it (recently in the news) but the LDS members do not and would be excommunicated if found so doing.    Why was it ever commanded?  There could be several reasons, of course the main reason is because the Lord commanded it, for his own purposes.  I can speculate that part of the reason is because of the restoration of the gospel.  The true and fulness of the gospel was restored again to the earth, that meant every aspect - which plural marriage IS a doctrine.  We believe there will be plural marriages still in effect in eternity.  So that may have been one reason.  Also, the church was new, women had no rights, men were killed because of the religion and some women may have been left alone.  Also, if people truly understood the blessings that await those who enter into the marriage covenant, that alone would intice many to want to be sealed to a worthy priesthood holder.    Anyhoo, there could be many reasons... but like I said, the main reason is because God commanded it.  Then, knowing it would need to be stopped, commanded to stop.  The doctrine has never changed, we just don't practice it - possibly for two reasons - there is no need for it and it is against the law.

AA11729666	I really think you're looking too hard on your first question.   As for me I believe in God, a Creator, because there is too much in the world, in science, or the way people interact with each other to suggest there is no God.    As for your second question about atheism, I completely disagree with that position.  Possibly because they are also looking too hard.  From my experience, atheism comes from a complete rejection of everything but science (even though science, still in its' infanacy mind you,  hasn't attempted nor will ever attempt to take on the "God" question) when that fails they move to a rudimentary (not meaning to bash anyone, but some of the arguements used by them on this forum don't hold water) understanding of logic/philosophy, usually due to some circumstance with a church or other faith group, and closes the mind to even the possiblity instead of working through it, they take the lazy way out by removing themselves from it entirely.    I believe it was Bacon who said something to the effect of "a little philosophy will lead to atheism, total immersion leads straight to God".  After alot of soul searching and watching, I find this to be the case.  To me, atheism is the reverse side of the religion coin and can be just as fanatical- hiding behind their own version of flawed logic (arguements based off the assumption that God is nonexistant) and taking the same leap of faith to say "there is no evidence for God".    I've seen too much in the world of chemistry and physics alone to make me believe "yes, God exists"     I also find it interesting that when it comes to Deism, atheists have a hard time arguing with it and die hard Christians will actually default to it.    ~Respectfully|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Why does anyone believe in god?|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Let me explain    The universe is made of matter, time, and space. None of these things are eternal, so they all had to start.    Time is not eternal, because it is relative to matter.  Space is not eternal because it ends at the furthest points of matter  Matter is not eternal because there is a certain amount, and that is all there is.    So whatever created time, matter, and space  was not matter and didn't abide to time and space. This is God. The Bible (written by God through his followers) Predicts Jesus in books written thousands of years before him because time doesnt apply to God. Past, present, and future don't exist to him. That is how he knows everything and is everywhere, space doesn't exist to him. Also he is not seen or felt in the physical world because he is not of matter.

Can you be more specific with you question?    ADD: A Theist is anyone who believes in a Creator of some sort.  A Deist is specifically someone who believes in a non-interventionist Creator.    I have been told that my beliefs encompass an idea similar to Deism. Let me see if I can explain:    So there is no evidence for the existence of a Creator-of-All and no sign of It acting directly in our lives, but I still believe in Its existence. That means that either by design or neglect, the Creator has created us then just left us to see what will happen and how the entire universe, including us, will develop.    Personally, I picture a bored deity trying to occupy its huge intellect by setting up a Domino fall ("rally") that is the size of the universe and the length of existence. Every law of motion is taken into account; every molecule's movement has been accounted for.    It just pushes over the first Domino: Big Bang.

The list is endless    of course fundies are famous for weaseling out from under the obvious to support their delusions of biblical infallibility|`|EBGdlo35aa	You wrote  ***********  "Who killed Goliath, David or Elhanan?"    This ones down to witness perception. Ask the police, they will tell you. Not a contradiction. More of a human error.  ***********    The problem with your answer is that a human error in the bible is an error in the bible.  The correct, plain and reasonable answer to this question is that both David and Elhanan killed someone named Goliath.  Why would someone think that only one guy from Gath was ever called "Goliath"?  In fact, given the popularity among the Gittites of the Goliath killed by David, it would seem quite likely that every big guy from Gath after that time would be named "Goliath" to "cash in on" that famous name.  Doesn't anyone else in the world have the same name as you?  "Goliath" may have been an extremely common name in Gath!      You wrote  ***********  "Tell me who Joseph's father was."    Both of them. Sometimes women cannot be sure when they get around a bit. Best to name them both just in case  ************    Your answer is correct, but your reasons are wrong.  The reasonable explanation is that Joseph was the first son of a man, and the son of his levirate marriage wife.  IN such a situation, Joseph would have been considered (according to Mosaic Law) to be the son of both fathers.      You wrote  ********  "Rabbits don't chew cud, Grasshoppers have six legs, Bats aren't birds"    Back then rabbits chewed cud, grasshoppers didn;t have six legs and bats were birds. Then things changed. Ever heard of evolution?  **********    Silly answer, of course.  Rabbits chew their food for an extended period of time (that is, after grazing).  What is meant by the Hebrew word translated "cud" is merely that - food that is masticated after it has been pulverized into single mass.  Naturally, using a translation "food that is masticated after it has been pulverized into single mass" is not as practical as using the word "cud".    Second, the bible never states that grasshoppers didn't have 6 legs.  It only states that they had 4 - which every grasshopper I have ever seen does.    Third, categorizing bats as "birds" is another translation choice.  First, it's quite obvious that the ancients did not use our modern zoological classification system.  Second, to translate the word with full precision as "flight capable animals" is not very practical.  The translators, unfortunately having conciseness of translation as a goal, use the accurate but less precise word "birds" to translate the Hebrew word that means "flight capable animals".

I guess science is equally a "fairy tale" since it also says animals can communicate - we just haven't relearned their methods yet.    On the "father of Joseph" question, that one is simple.  Jacob was his father, while Heli was his father-in-law.  Not that Luke says that "was supposed" the Joseph was the son of Heli, the son of...etc".

sMknd0Ofaa	Jesus said, "Upon this rock I will build MY church". He did not say, churches. One church, and one true doctrine. The doctrines that he preached is the truth. Do not add or take away... Also he said, their will be many people preaching a false Jesus. Question is, who are these people preaching a false Jesus? You have to weed these people out to find the real truth. It's not going to be easy. It's like finding a needle in a hay stack. Just because a church preaches Jesus, does not mean they are from god. Satan is standing behind these preachers with a smile on his face because these people are actually buying it.

The existence of a course whose primary purpose is to speak of the ethics of science demonstrates the extent to which morality has entered into the scientific realm. Because religion often includes a moral code for the conduct of human affairs, it is not altogether unbelievable that the question of religion's role in science comes to light now and again. One aspect of the discussion of religion and science focuses on the concept of their co-existence: Can one be a disciple of both theology and science without compromising one's belief in the other? or, Is it entirely impossible for one to be devout followers of both fields? It seems unlikely that one should have to choose between the two subjects. I find little reason why one cannot have claims to both science and theology. The Christian belief contains perspectives which may come into friction with certain scientific principles. However, I believe that it is possible for one to find a happy medium between the two fields and not feel a sense of disloyalty to either. Although I have much to learn still of the technicalities of science and the mysteries of Christianity, I believe I have thus far been able to find my medium and still remain happy.|`|7NugugsDaa	Nothing is wrong with religion,haven't you noticed the Holy Bible,Koran,Torah all have Adam and Eve and almost have the exact same stories in them they all derived from Judaism.|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Probably for the same reason no two humans of the secular community, that is to say those who do not believe in the God of the Bible or HIS Words, cannot agree the theory of evolution,  andmore soo, why many scientists who research revolution and its theories as well.        Just like any other question, I would ask that you limit your question to a specific category or element.

(Psalms 51: 5)  Yet, the bible also says that God was most fond of the sons of man, or his human creation.  (Proverbs 8:30)  What God doesn't like is when we consistently, willfully sin by blatantly going against his principles and laws.  (Hebrews 10:26)  I personally find it interesting that persons who don't believe the bible is God's word, usually still live by a set of principles, and laws.  Sometimes, the principles and laws they live by are innate within themselves, or personal values.   Oftentimes, people will choose to live by man made laws.  Oh, Yeah about BURNING in hell, that's an idea that originated with Pagans, and not Christians.

Luke 13:3  I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.    Luke 15:7  I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	God loves everyone and wants to be with everyone.

Yes God loves sinners as he loves us all because we are children of the Father and the brother of Christ.  The Bible and ancient writings tell us that Lucifer was the most beloved of all angels but that wasn't enough for him.  God still loves him but has separated Lucifer from him the same way you might separate a child from your other children.      There is no limit to God's love, to say so would be limiting God who is love.  Those who go to hell have chosen to reject God not God reject them.|`|TzDvl1CUaa	well yeah    Rom. 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.    did you get that last word,  "us"|`|GMmmbLGRaa	Romans 5:8, "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." In this verse and in John 3:16, we find no conditions placed on God's love for us. God doesn't say, "as soon as you clean up your act, I'll love you; " nor does He say, "I'll sacrifice my Son if you promise to love Me." In fact, in Romans 5:8, we find just the opposite. God wants us to know that His love is unconditional, so He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us while we were still unlovable sinners. We didn't have to get clean, and we didn't have to make any promises to God before we could experience His love. His love for us has always existed, and because of that, He did all the giving and sacrificing long before we were even aware that we needed His love.       As far as Satan; Jude 1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

Remember God doesn't force anyone, it's up to them to choose eternal life or hell.    Evolutionists believe that (1) the Earth and Moon are 4.5 billion years old, and (2) with enough time bacteria will change into people. We have all heard some evolutionists say, Given enough time, anything can happen. This simplistic attitude overlooks two things. First, most conceivable events will not happen, because they would violate well-established laws of science.1 Second, if 4.5 billion years have elapsed, many things should have occurred that obviously have not. Rather than time being the hero of the plot, as one prominent evolutionist stated,2 immense amounts of time cause problems for evolution, as you will now see.  Most dating techniques, including the majority that indicate young ages, make the three basic assumptions given on page?34. The following dating technique has few, if any, major assumptions. It relies basically on only the law of gravity and one undisputed and frequently repeated measurement. We will look at the forces causing the Moon to spiral farther and farther away from Earth. Then we will see that this spiraling action could not have been happening for the length of time evolutionists say that the Earth and Moon have been around.  It will be shown that if the Moon began orbiting very near the Earth, it would move to its present position in only 1.2 billion years. Stated another way, if we could run time backwards, in 1.2 billion years the Moon would be so close to Earth that ocean tides would sweep over all mountains. Astronomers who are aware of this problem call it the lunar crisis.3? Notice that this conclusion does not say that the Earth-Moon system is 1.2 billion years old; it only says that the Earth-Moon system must be less than 1.2 billion years old. If the Moon began orbiting Earth slightly inside the Moons present orbit, its age would be much less. Obviously, something is wrong with either the law of gravity or evolutionists belief that the Earth-Moon system is 4.5 billion years old. Most astute people would place their confidence in the law of gravity, which has been verified by countless experiments.    How does (Fn - Ff) relate to the Earth-Moon separation distance (R)? Using similar triangles,       where y is the misalignment distance of each tidal bulge, m is the Moons mass, mb is the mass of each tidal bulge, and G is the gravitational constant. Solving for (Fn - Ff)      Equation 1b showed that the mass of a tidal bulge, mb, is approximately proportional to 1/R3, that is      where C1 is the constant of proportionality. Therefore      The velocity of the Moon (or any body in a circular orbit) is      where M is Earths mass (or the mass of the central body).  Differentiating both sides with respect to time (t) and solving for gives      Because the Moons tangential acceleration, , is equal to , which is known from equation (2)      The slight displacement of the tidal bulge (y), as mentioned earlier, is proportional to the difference in the Earths spin rate (w) and the Moons angular velocity (wL). In other words,      Substituting (4) into (3) and replacing the product of all constants by C gives      C is found by using todays values (subscript t)      Keplers third law shows how (w - wL) varies with R:      Applying the law of conservation of angular momentum gives      where the constant L is the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, and P is Earths polar moment of inertia. Combining (7) and (8) gives      Substituting (6), (7), and (9) into (5) gives us the final equation. Because it has no closed-form solution, it will be solved by numerical iteration. The steps begin by setting the clock to zero and R to its present value of 384,400 km. Then time is stepped backwards in small increments (dt) until the centers of the Moon and Earth are only 15,000 km apart. Had this happened, ocean tides would have steadily grown to a ridiculous 12.8 km (8 miles) high and left marks on Earth that would bebut obviously are notvisible.8      The QuickBasic program that solves this system of equations (shown on page 427) gives 1.2 billion years as the upper limit for the age of the Moon. (If the Moon began moving away from Earth 1.2 billion years ago, the Earth would have rotated once every 4.9 hours.)  Two complicated effects were neglected that would further reduce this upper limit for the Moons age.9  1. Evolutionists believe that the Earth formed by gravitational accretion of smaller bodies. If so, the impacts would have left a molten Earth. The Earth, throughout its history, would have been less rigid than it is today. Therefore, tidal bulges would have been larger, causing the Moon to spiral away from the Earth even faster than we calculated here.    2. Internal friction from tidal stretching of the solid Earth reduces Earths spin velocity. A greater value for w in the past would h|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Baptism is always a good way to celebrate.|`|WF085j2Daa	celebrate every day, you are young and free of medieval restrictions, your life can only get better|`|pYrooh0Haa	Fire up the grill and roast some babbies!|`|JqHkgWROaa	I believe typical parties include babby-que's and pin the tail on the Jesus.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	-Chants-  Babby- que, Babby- que, Babby- que|`|nqcnylFpaa	i roasted a bible over an open fire little evil spirits came out.|`|zkETPA8waa	Have a feast of deep-fried babby.

Other religions have some truth to them, that varies by degrees, so rather than true vs. false the church leaders historically have more appropriately discussed it in terms of a fullness rather than a partial.    That being said, who am I to state that for some person, for some reason that I don't understand, another path might be better for them than the one God has clearly indicated that I walk?

However, Paul says there is one body, Jesus came to establish His church (not churches).  As a restorationalist, my plea is that we try to set aside denominational traditions, practices, and names.  I plead that we throw out divisive creeds and return to the New Testament pattern for the Church that God established in Christ and through the teachings and writings of the apostles.  I believe we are to do things the way they did them, call things what they called them.  We are not to add to what they did in worship nor change what they said was obedience to the gospel. As one early American restorationalist said, 'Let us speak where the Bible speaks and be silent where the Bible is silent; let us call Bible things by Bible names."

They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. 17The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my lifeonly to take it up again. 18No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.|`|dcOcokofaa	Not if they don't KNOW about God or Jesus. If they have been offered a testemony and turn it down or away then the will have a final chance in the thousand year period that Christ reigns on earth. If they still don'r accept Him, then Yeah, sure they will. It will only be a temporary visit though. Then it's into the lake of fire. Not my judgment, God's.|`|ZWA8PPUCaa	Yes, people do go to heaven even if they do not believe in God. When they die they will be judged on how good their life was and then it will be decided if the go to heaven or hell.   If you have lived a good life, helping people and caring for others and not just thinking of yourself then you will go to heaven.   But if you have done bad things and you are selfish and don't care about others then, you will go to hell.   If you have lived a life mixed of the two things described previously then you will go to purgatory. Think of purgatory as the place people go when they have not been totally freed from the sins they have done on earth. So they will stay there until all their sins have been cleaned from their souls and until they have paid for the sins that they have done on earth.|`|KPDOrmTsaa	...except a man be born again, he shall not see the kingdom of heaven.

For those that think God doesn't exist because an ALL-LOVING God wouldn't send people to Hell are misinformed. God doesn't SEND anyone. And because he is also ALL-HOLY, he can't come into contact with sin. So he became human to be with us and so there would be a way (Hmmm that sounds like Jesus)    The Bible supports that, but I don't know where off the top of my head.|`|dE4pdCX0aa	no offense but god and heaven is a hole load of crap|`|MYnH6UKQaa	i think if you believe in it, thats what its going to be like. happiness and all those goodies. dosnt mean the people that dont believe in it wont have a good afterlife tho. they will just look at it different.

On the negative side, religion has been at the heart of many a war and many a conflict, relgion has tended over the centuries to hold back the pursuit of human knowledge and advancement.  (One wonders how early the scientific method would have been codified, one wonders how early the industrial revolution would have occurred had it not been for the retarding effects of religion and religious dogma).  One has to lay at the feet of religion a portion of those issues which divide us into those little colors on the map.  Religions are and always will be deeply divisive.  (Origin of the common sense adage two things you never discuss are religion and politics).|`|AA11440601	Of course not.    A few things where the Catholic Church has made the world a better and brighter place are:  + Relief from the Barbarian invasions of the early middle ages  + Rescued Christian and pre-christian literature  + Spread agricultural and animal husbandry knowledge  + Started and protected universities  + Sponsored and supported science and medicine  + Created International Law theory  + Developed and sponsored modern economic theory  + Invented charity as we know it  + Codified, expanded, and improved Western Law   + Western Morality  + Created just war theory    I suggest you read the book "How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization" by Thomas E.

f8mLpPXlaa	Faith in God will be rewarded many times over. The things that happened to Job were things that happen all the time to other people. Of course if seems as though Job had an unusual run of bad luck but the point is he didn't lose his faith or love of God. He didn't know that there was a larger game afoot. One thing that the story does show is that God has control of Satan. So next time you are tempted be aware that it is a test.  And God has no ego. That's your problem, thinking you know better than He.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	I think He loved His job.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	Satan told God that he could get Job to turn from God and follow him that is why God let Satan test Job.  God is a spirit and doesn't have an ego in my opinion.  Job proved God right to Satan and Satan fled.  The point of the story is that no matter how much Satan test a person if they stay true to God He will help them to overcome the temptation and their faith will be stronger because of it.|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	God doesnt have an ego  everything he does is for our benefit|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Back in those times, women were posessions and children were workers.

All that go their own way will find suffering and misery in this life. Job may have being a up right man, but was not following after the spirit and lived his own life, not a servant of heaven.       as the bible says misery and destruction are in their ways. Job should be happy God favored him and gave back everything and more in the end. And his children like millions of children never loved the Lord and each one is to their own. We have our own minds, just because they are Jobs children does not mean they have a Special privilege.|`|AA10741853	The story shows God's loving character, heretic.|`|ij5Sv6staa	Yes here is the morality, that Job loved God more than anything else in this world.    God also asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son to God, to test whether Abraham loved God more than anything in this world.    Both passed the test.  This world is insignificant to what awaits us in the next life.      God humbled himself to become human, through Jesus, and willingly permitted himself to be killed for our sins, as the perfect example of how to put others, including God, ahead of your own selfish desires.....that is true unconditional love, and until you have that, you have nothing.|`|UJtUpWO0aa	JOB!  As we should know by the History of Job that he is now with God in Heaven.  What does all this toil matter today if we are to be with God in Heaven tomorrow?         God used Job's story early on in History to give a us "worse case scenario."  If you can still believe and trust the God of the Bible after witnessing and reviewing what Job had experienced, certainly you will be able to experience the trials and tribulations we have to experience through our own admissions and courses in life with repenting in ours sins, that bring us through our lives.          There are many stories, both as severe and not as severe as Job's that God attempts to reach us through.  Bottom line is if we trust and believe in the God of the Bible,  and learn to follow his commands and live as Jesus did, we will be with God in Heaven for the eternity he promises.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	Maybe Job was meant to be our example of how to get through difficult times and not give up on God.

U6IlTnuXaa	I was reading these answers and decided to do a little research and I think Acts hit the nail on the head.    "No more than Nature desires the mating of weaker with stronger individuals, even less does she desire the blending of a higher with a lower race, since, if she did, her whole work of higher breeding, over perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, night be ruined with one blow. Historical experience offers countless proofs of this. It shows with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people."  "All great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning.  The ultimate cause of such a decline was their forgetting that all culture depends on men and not conversely; hence that to preserve a certain culture the man who creates it must be preserved. This preservation is bound up with the rigid law of necessity and the right to victory of the best and stronger in this world."  "If we pass all the causes of the German collapse in review, the ultimate and most decisive remains the failure to recognize the racial problem and especially the Jewish menace."    All of these quotes come directly from Mein Kampf.      It is best to remain quiet and have people think you are stupid than to open your mouth and therefore remove all doubt.|`|eomrfXrzaa	Hitler hated jews because he thought they kept him from achieving his dream. (being an artist)|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	No, Hitler was responsible for the Holocaust. Moron.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	books dont kilp ppl.....NONONO|`|7NugugsDaa	That is so old and so over. NEXT QUESTION PLEASE|`|gW0nD5cEaa	No, some Antisemites have used the bible, and some excerpts from the Bible as an excuse for 2 thousand years.     The Jews spoken of were the Jewish authorities, just as people in much of the world would blame the US government for things they don't like and say 'the Americans' but maybe not blame the everyday people (though some would).    Antisemitism was terrible in the middle ages and later. And again religion was used as an excuse. But to blame the Holocaust on the Bible or Christians at large is just not right. The New Testament above all else teaches love, it condemns hatred. Of course that does not mean people always follow it.    Hitler was a mad man who unfortunately had a lot of bigots for followers, or those who were led to bigotry and hatred. It could have somebody from a Muslim country who went against Christians, or a Jewish fanatic who used some Old Testament passages to go against gentiles. Mostly, I don't think he used the Bible at all. But some of his followers, who were Christian used the Bible to justify their thinking. And he no doubt quoted scriptures to get people to believe his lies. That is not unique.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>While the anti-Semitism of the Holocaust was greater in scope than any previous mass attacks on Jews, it was not different in motive from the Crusades, the Inquisition    The Crusades were defensive wars with Muslims.

YAWN|`|funeSrxUaa	There is more evidence that suggests Darwin contributed to Hitlers thought process of wiping out the Jews.  It's undeniable that Darwin was a racist. Consider the subtitle to Charles Darwins The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. The subtitle is: The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life. Favored Races? What can he be referring to with this statement? The answer is found in his work, Descent of Man, At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the [Afrikaners] (even though this is a direct quote from the book, the word here was understandably deleted) or the Australian and the gorilla. (Descent of Man, Chapter Six: On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man, On the Birthplace and Antiquity of Man). Darwin taught the inferiority of certain humans, specifically the dark skinned humans of the Afrikaners and the Australian Aborigines. It is through this work that Hitler gleaned the thought to wipe out the Jewish people.  Hitler even said that it was through Darwin's survival of the fittest is where he came up with the idea of the Aryan race.  Those first standing in the way, were those that were in his own country.  The Jewish people.    He did not base any of his thoughts from the New Testament.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	I don't know what you build your conceptions on Nebulajr.  The Christian church sees itself as the fulfillment of the Jewish faith, not attacking it.  If you will read your history you will discover it was a coalition of Jewish and Romans that attacked the early church and destroyed and tortured thousands.  What history books have you been reading?  Was it indifference that kept us fighting for 6 years to end this injustice?  Did all these brave men die for indifference?  Reword your Question and build in some facts next time.  Love Kent.|`|XpZumlkwaa	Yeshua  prophesied about those who would kill, thinking they are doing God a service. John 16:1-2.  But, he was speaking to his disciples about persecution.  Hitler was an ignorant German with the power to mastermind his more than ignorant followers.  Did he actually, physically lift a hand to kill or did he just make a call made  it happen?  Thats what happen in the death of the Yeshua . Some people called out and made it happen.  But was it at their hand? I know that it was NOT. (Romans Germans, there is little difference).  Not all that were in Jerusalem that day were Jewish.   The Jewish people loved the Lord (all that were crying).      The people that shouted out that day were NOT naturally born there; they just had residence there.   I cant believe that Darwin is STILL being preached after his death bed confession that it was all a lie.

I am on the NT.  2. Do you read and speak Greek and Hebrew and feel confident about your abilities to translate Greek and Hebrew into the English?  I feel confident about my abilities to research the translations.   3. If you do not read or speak Greek or Hebrew, are you well equipped to use Greek or Hebrew study aids in your study of the Bible?  Very equipped, all Christians should use these aides.    4. When reading the New Testament, are you aware when reading a text that what you are reading is a quote from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament)? Yes.    5. When reading the New Testament when it quotes from the Old Testament, are you confident that the New Testament quote has been quoted accurately?  I am as confident as I can be given the trustworthiness of the NT.  Given that we have over 5000 MSS in existance, we can deduce through the variant readings and get as close as possible to the original words.  Most estimates [both Princeton (Metzger) and Oxford (Bruce) professors] are that the NT is about 99.6% pure.    6. Are you so well versed with the Old Testament that you could spot an Old Testament passage misquoted in the New Testament? Good question, it's very possible that one could slip by me.    7. Are you so well versed with the Old Testament that you could recognize a New Testament passage as a combination of parts of two different passages in the Old Testament which have not only two different contexts but originally two different intended meanings?  Likely so since I'm well-versed in the NT.     If you are trying to demonstate that the Bible has errors, well you won't get a fight here, that is, that there are scribal errors. However, that doesn't alter the content in the least.  Here you have a book, written over 1500 years by 40 different authors, translated and copied thousands of times, the book attests to one thing, the coming messiah, his birth, life, death and resurrection and the whole thing fits together beautifully and without any context/doctrine issues at all.  The amount of collusion necessary to achieve that is astounding, the fact that the text is 99.6% pure is amazing and we have enough extant copies to show that the subtle variances do nothing at all to alter that message.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Do you know that God makes wise the simple?

They will betray anything for the sake of their miserable jobs and incomes (1995, p. 104).    Hitlers references to God and the ritualistic pageantry of Nazism were pagan. Earthly symbols of German valour and Teutonic strength were to be worshipped - not the forgiving, compassionate representative of an Eastern Mediterranean servant ethic imposed on credulous ancient Germans by force and subterfuge (the phrase is Burleighs own, in Michael Burleigh, The Third Reich: a New History, Pan, 2001). A Hitler Youth marching song (Grunberger, A Social History) illustrates it:     We follow not Christ, but Horst Wessel,   Away with incense and Holy Water,   The Church can go hang for all we care,   The Swastika brings salvation on Earth.   (Horst Wessel was an early Nazi party Sturmabteilung street-fighter murdered by communists and turned into a martyr by propaganda chief Josef Goebbels.)    Some 4000 Protestant ministers, led by Karl Barth and Hans Asmussen, formed the Confessing Church, which at Barmen in 1934 declared that no human Fuhrer could stand above the Word of God.

(i.e. non-Christian)  b) Hitler performed genocide, clearly not the act of a Christian  c) The dictator Stalin was once a seminarian (i.e. he completed two years of theological education before being kicked out), and yet he was responsible for atrocities rivaling Hitler.    Clearly - the choices we make in life (irrespective of our cultural or religious origins) dictate whether or not we are Christian.      Christians are called to Glorify God through their actions...those that do not - are they really Christians?  Matthew 5:16  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.|`|L8ILriBKaa	The answer is as obvious as it seems.    The Catholic Church strongly supported Hitler and the Nazi Party - not one person in the world can deny that. Whose to say Hitler didn't actually act in the name of Christianity?     At the time, nobody would claim Hitler as an Atheist, but now Christians would claim him as Atheist due to his destructive philosophy. During Hitlers reign, Christianity was in the process of being spread and also eliminated conflicting religion (Judaism) - it was Win-Win for both parties. Once the wold was aware of the destructive ways of persecution, people said "That's horrible" - which created a poor image for the Church that supported him and knew what Hitler was doing. Christianity obviously does not like to be seen in a negative light.    Adolf had grown up in the Catholic Church, was an altar boy, and even talked against Atheism in a couple of his speeches. Nazi soldiers wore Christian crosses, were sometimes buried under Christian tombstones (even his own mother) - the guy was Catholic, or at least said he was.      Hitler may have used the mantle of religion to justify and further his selfish, hateful, and destructive philosophy-- however that doesn't tell anyone if he was an actual Christian or not.|`|9goJfYZGaa	ignorance.  and don't forget Christians could never do anything so evil!

I guess I read people's answers,  but don't make much notice of WHO they are or what they say really.  Guess I should start trying to pay attention to WHO says what. hehehehhehe    I agree with your statements overall and are WELL aware of those facts/viewpoints.   __________________________    However, let me be the YING to your YANG  -- or bring balance back to the middle.    > -- it has been decades since I looked into that religion,  but I know I don't agree with the majority of their doctrines/principles.  They sound innocent on the surface, but can lead to some really bad ideas.    > - TRUE, however not all theories are right and not all non-theories are wrong.  I happen to believe in a mixture, a directed evolution which marries the physical evidence with my religious beliefs that their is a God,  mine is not a true Theory, because their are elements of it which can't be supported, but that doesn't automatically mean it is wrong.   Just pointing that out so you don't loose sight of that fact.  Intelligent Design is another attempt at marrying some of the physical evidence with a religious belief, it may not fit ALL the physical evidence, but none the less.. it is an attempt to marry the 2.     However, I contend that HOW we got here is not as important as the fact that we ARE here and what we do NOW or into the future.  Religion was not meant to look at Physical evidence no more then Science was meant to find evidence of God.  The 2 are in distinctly different spheres and should COOPERATE together to give humanity the best picture of our universe as we can.     It is MUCH better to combine their spheres of influence then to pit them against each other.    > -- Accepted as fact by a great number of people...but we have to be careful not to loose sight of the reality that BOTH are merely thoeries.  Theories are only 1 experiment away from being disproved. They are NEVER facts, even if they are accepted as such by the general population. Theories ALWAYS teter on the edge of being discarded or disproven. -- Please keep that in mind and don't loose sight of that, less Humanity get too cocky.    > -- CORRECT, but entirely different to actually BE inspired by God and contain religious doctrine fit for instruction and which stands outside scrutiny.   Many people have tried to create their own religious texts and MANY have failed.  So there are thousands of really bad attempts which none the less, make the CLAIM to be the word of God,  but precious few which last centuries and stand up to outside scrutiny.  Much like your "accepted as fact" statement.  There are MANY books which claim to be the word of God,  but FEW that are "accepted" as the word of God. -- This is a HUGE difference that we ALL  need to keep in mind.  The book of Islam, the Bible, the Torah, are some of the most Notable examples of Scripture which has withstood scrutiny. The bible is not the only one. -- Obviously as a Catholic I believe it is the TRUE one, but I realize it is not the only the one to make this claim.    I'm not agreeing with this "fireball" figure you refer to..but just thought some balance to your statements was needed.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Oh really.  By the way there were 44 known writers of The Bible.

Obviously you have no experience in the study of scripture or you would understand something about historical, cultural, and social backgrounds; the original languages; the history of interpretation; relating texts to the whole canon of Scripture to draw your theological, doctrinal and homiletical conclusions so you then can make your claim with some authority that anyone, like yourself can write a similar book.

They despise all religion more so Christian and higher yet Catholics they have entered the Church also and work to bring about it's down fall from the inside, The Apostasy!  These are the ones Christ warned us about they have revamped over and over changing here and there but they can be traced back to Cain.  Self service is serving satan as Christ said you will have one of two masters one you will serve the other you will hate, they hate the light they talk about the light of mankind and not the light from God, this elevates there own glory and denies God's glory defiling his name and blinding the world to truth, They are multiplying as is atheism that follows there lies, but this is all about to end and there reward is eternal damnation, Christ warned them God warned them but they preferred to have their glory in the world.  This is the gist it goes much deeper but know that they can cause destruction by calling on demons and dark magic to souls who are not grounded in Christ, Father Malachy Martin said the possessed are rampant now and the Vatican have called for a thousand more priests to be trained in exorcism because of the growth, Satan's power is growing because he is given more power by the amount of sin committed, they have no power over Christians as God protects his own.  God bless and pray more these days..

He never kept a full time job.  Most of the time we lived off my govt checks and food stamps.  I thought his anger was my fault.  I would walk three miles to go to work as a cook and dish washer at a restaurant and three miles back home.  During that time he was off getting a neighbor girl pregnant.  Our divorce was only less than 100 dollars a do it yourself.  Because he owned nothing and we had no children toge other.

JO8YzDNVaa	Because logic and reasoning is beyond them.  If they had the ability to think critically, they would not be extremist religious fundamentalists   Also a group mentality shelters them from reality|`|vSomavIzaa	I am a fundamentalist Christian. When is the last time you've heard of a Christian fundamentalist murdering an abortion provider? I haven't heard of a single case in years. And somewhere right here in America, dozens of babies are being murdered, skulls pierced and crushed and sucked out of their mother's womb by a small handheld vacuum and dropped in pieces and parts into a plastic garbage can to be disposed of as common trash. Absolute murder.     Of the millions of fundamentalist Christians out there, why would you phrase your question as though millions of us should accept responsibility for the actions of "one" person who decided "he" is the tip of God's spear of judgement? Put that many people into any pigeon hole (any religion, or no religion at all) and statistically speaking, you're going to have at least one nut in the crowd. It's kind of like people who badmouth muslims. 19 nuts with boxcutters supposedly blew up some planes and crashed them into buildings on 9/11, and now we're all supposed to play along and launch a holy war because these crazy muslims all want us dead?? Please. How many millions of peace loving muslims are out there who have nothing to do with violence, yet they are all branded as fanatics because of the actions of less than a hundredth of one percent of their congregation. If the propaganda they tell us about them is correct, we should be under attack constantly. Yet we aren't.  Evil men want nothing more than to have Christians and Muslims kill each other off in a world war so that they (luciferians) can profit from it.  I would urge all Christians and Muslims to NOT fall for it. Wake up. We are all being manipulated into going along with their plan for war and violence.   I'm an evangelical Christian and I fundamentally disagree wholeheartedly with the muslims about their faith, but in no way would I ever wish any of them harm. They are created in God's perfect image and how dare I to think any more highly of myself than them? I do believe they will die and go to hell unless they repent and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, but that's because I believe the Bible is accurate. That's not just my own bigoted opinion. Jesus said "I am the way the truth and the light, no one comes to the Father except through me". Then you have the account in John chapter 14 where Jesus (again) tells His disciples that He alone is God. You have to either believe Jesus IS who He says He is, or he was a liar. To say He was merely a prophet is to say that His statements are lies. And a lying prophet is a false prophet. And a false prophet is a fraud and therefore not worth anything, even honoring as a "good man". He was more than a "good man".     So maybe from now on, since you choose to judge all of us Christians on the thoughts and actions of "one" Christian, maybe from here on out you can judge all of us Christians by "me" (since you just heard from one here, straight from the horse's mouth), and not from something that someone with an agenda "told you" to believe about us.    God will deal with anyone who chooses to act violently against an abortion provider. God says "wrath is MINE".|`|7sEFufRbaa	opposed to what the many nonbelievers and communists who contribute greatly to society?

2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	Since his ascension to heaven, Jesus Christ dwells in unapproachable light, whom not one of men has seen or can see. (1?Timothy 6:16) Thus, literal human eyes will never see him again. As Jesus said on the last day of his earthly life: A little longer and the world will behold me no more. (John 14:19) He can be seen only in a figurative way.Ephesians 1:18; Revelation 1:7.    Jesus said that it would be possible for his disciples to discern when Gods Kingdom would commence ruling. How? By means of a sign. In answer to the question, What will be the sign of your presence? Jesus outlined visible proof of his future invisible rule.Matthew 24:3.    Included in the sign was an illustration showing what kind of people would benefit from it. Wherever the carcass is, said Jesus, there the eagles will be gathered together. (Matthew 24:28) All who want to survive the end of the present system into Gods new world must gather together and enjoy spiritual food along with Christs eaglelike chosen ones.Matthew 24:31, 45-47.|`|BpNrx9Viaa	eagles?  sounds like vulture|`|AA11008046	Earlier in the chapter the disciples ask two question of Jesus and he was answering them.  The disciples asked what signs would there be of His coming and of the end of age.  Jesus in His answer told them to make sure "..no one deceives you.." and carried on with details saying and I paraphrase - "..you will of wars and rumors of wars..nation will rise against nation...there will be famines, earthquakes, pestilences in various places..You will be delivered to sorrows for His name sake..People will betray and hate one another..false prophets will rise up and deceive many..they will say look here is the Christ do not believe it..for as the ligthning comes from the east and flashes to the east, and wherever the carcasses are the eagles will gather.  Immediately after these days the sun will darken..the moon will not give its light..the stars will fall...then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in Heaven..He will come on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  All of that is Jesus' answer to their question of how will we know and what sign will there be of your second coming?  Most of the preceeding things have and are happening now.  it is only a matter of little time until the rest of the scripture is fulfilled.  Be Prepared, Pray up, Pack up, look up, 'cause we are going up!  to meet him in the clouds - IF we are ready and living for Him daily.  The key is constantly being ready.  Pray without ceasing.  Do your best to do right.  Do right by all around you even if they are not so considerate of you.  You are responsible for your ticket to Heaven so do your best to as God tells us in His Word.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	The proper greek is "Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.

Rev 1:7  Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

What is recorded in Matthew chapter 24, verses 23 through 28, touches on developments from and after 70?C.E. and on into the days of Christs invisible presence (parousia). The warning against false Christs is not simply a repetition of verses 4 and 5. The later verses are describing a longer time perioda time when such men as the Jewish Bar Kokhba led a revolt against the Roman oppressors in 131-135?C.E., or when the much later leader of the Bahai religion claimed to be Christ returned, and when the leader of the Doukhobors in Canada professed to be Christ the Savior.

God bless|`|641c55ed860a473abbc5c57c2b35186aaa	I prefer the wording that  "vultures will gather" and not eagles, the interpretation of "vultures" is a better representation.  But it is a metaphor.  He is saying that the carcass is an imposter claiming to be God and that the vultures are people running to see.  Jesus says later that everyone will know when the son of man arrives, there will be no question, no person running to tell another person because it will be seen by everyone and everyone will know immediately
xtosLCS5aa	well I learned about 7 and this year, 8th grade.|`|T3WXhBW0aa	I was raised not realizing the difference between races. Obviously people of other races looked different because of their skin color, but so did people of my race with different hair color.

It is a sad realization when you find out that is how the world operates.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	It was 10th, 11th grade for me.  I didn't realize I was learning late.

People in my school, for instance, still sit in groups largely defined by race, not because theyre racist but because tehy get on best with people from similar backgrounds.|`|AA10339249	What is it like to learn racism at any age? Some people will argue that racism is instilled in a person, like a constant. However, I wonder if it does matter what type of people you're around. For instance, if all black people that I met were friendly, I might never feel an ambivalence against them. However, since meeting a few (here lately, one in particular) that are unfriendly and not willing to be friendly at all, the feeling of racism comes easier.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	Because children are the most innocient creatures. They do not hate, they do not covet, and they are forgiving. The reason 5-6 is considered school age is because that is the time children start remembering things really well. That is the age that a child will most likely adopt positive or negative behaviors. An infant or a toddler may do this as well, but they do not dwell on certain things like a school age child might. For example, stick 5 three year olds in the same room without their parents for a few hours a day. say two are black, one is chinese, and two are white. say all of their parents are exceptionally racist. Yeah, the first couple of days, the kids might be shy of each other or curious as they may have had little exposure to children outside of their race as playmates. But, after that first initial awkward getting to know you stage, they will play like they have known each other all their lives and be perfectly comfortable with it. Race wouldn't be an issue with them because their minds aer focused on meeting their own needs, and when they are at play school or day care, their need is to play. now fast forward three years. They are now all going into kindergarten. They are beginning to take note of what their parents have to say about other races. The chinese kid hears her mom say that white people are greedy and filthy. The child, now better able to link information, knows that this isn't a nice thing to say, but since mom said it, it must be true. So, being a child, when she gets mad at one of her play mates, she says the first thing she remembers her mom saying about that race "your greedy and dirty because your white!' etc..see what I'm getting at?    edit: my own experience? Well, I first noticed I was being treated differently in fourth grade. My teacher had six tables of desks that we would rotate through. Every week, we got a new desk at a new table. Except me, the mexican kid, the chinese kid and the black kid. We sat at the same table right next to the teachers desk every week. We didn't get to change desks. And she wouldn't let us keep anything in them at the end of the day, and if anybody lost anything, we would have to empty out our desks and let the kid look to see if we had stolen it. And we were never called on when we raised our hands. It was the parent of one of the white kids who noticed this when she volunteered in our class and went to the principal. The teacher didn't get fired though. We just got moved to another teachers class room. My mom was going to sue the school, but put me in another school instead.|`|JOdlqhQwaa	I learned it in Grade 11.|`|WBpVZpb0aa	I didn't learn racism until like, high school.

When I came into class the next day clearly beat up the teacher asked what happen then said since I'm white all they can do is give the other kids detention (they got out of it by saying I called them racist names).    Thats when I learned what it was about. To this day I still have a bunch of mixed raced friends.

I am most definately not shy there, but that is a strength that only comes from God.      Anywhere else, church, sunday school, yes I do fit the shy category. Its hard for me to open up in small groups that are outside my singles ministry.      I really chose wisely those that I do fellowship with.  Just because someone says they are a christian, doesn't mean they live by Christian standards, including, not gossiping.  So for those that tell me things, they go to my grave or if I need advice to help them, ask those in my leadership group for the ministry and again, are upheld in the highest confidence.

BTpNkxoeaa	Transgender - It started out meaning an individual who lived full time presenting as the opposite gender from their birth sex without the desire for permanent surgeries.  Transgender has changed meaning into an umbrella term for any person with a gender identity/expression that differs from their birth sex.  This includes but isn't limited to crossdressing/transvestism, transsexual, transgenderist, androgyny, genderqueer, etc.    Transvestite - Alternatively a crossdresser, is a person who wears clothing normally associated with the opposite.  Although the term can be applied to both sexes, it is almost always used on men who crossdress.  How far they take their dressing and how often they do it varies.  It can be a sexual fetish, but for most they do it because they like the sense of self it gives them.      Transsexual - Somebody who has a gender identity that is the complete opposite from their birth sex.  This results in gender dysphoria/gender identity disorder.  Classic transsexualism has been scientifically proven to be a neurological intersex condition.  The only proven method of relief for a transsexual is to allow them to medically transition to the sex that matches their gender.  Some transsexuals choose not to have sex reassignment surgery, but it is almost always because of the medical risks involved and/or financial reasons.    Some extra notes:     - Transgender is most often assocaited with somebody who is transsexual or living full time as the opposite sex.  However, some  transsexuals and other gender-variant individuals do not prefer the transgender term and will get offended if you call them transgendered.  If in doubt, ask.      - Don't assume a transgender person's sexual orientation.  They can be straight, bisexual, gay, lesbian, or asexual just like anybody else.  Doing so can be extremely offensive.     - Transvestite in some areas, like the U.S., is considered an outdated and pejorative term and crossdresser is the preferred usage.     - Drag is a performance act for entertainment.  Drag Queens/Kings are not necessarily transgendered.|`|SwreJuEkaa	I'll try to give a real answer, unlike that of "FRO" who really didn't contribute anything to the discussion, didn't answer the question and really just offended people.     Transvestites may dress in the clothes that are considered to be stereotypical of the "opposite sex," like a man putting on a skirt and a tank top with high heels. Sometimes it's done because the person wants to look and feel more like the opposite sex, and can be done for "Sexual gratification"; however it doesn't always mean that they wish to become the opposite sex.    Transgendered and Transsexual are almost the same thing, although IMO people who are transgendered consider themselves to be the gender opposite of what they are physically, they may dress and act the part of their true gender (What they are on the inside as opposed to what their body may look like) but might not have had an operation to officially become that gender quite yet.     I sort of consider people who are called transsexual to be those who have already gone through a sex-change operation, although use of "Transgendered" can also just be used when you don't want to say "Transsexual," just like how some like to call themselves transwomen and transmen instead.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Transvestite- someone who dresses in the clothing of the opposite sex, usually on a part-time basis.  It can be for a variety of reasons, from sexual excitement to simply because it feels fun.  Transvestite is a more outdated medical term; cross-dresser or CD is more commonly used now.    Transgender- an umbrella term used to refer to anybody who does not conform to a binary gender system (masculine men, feminine women, people who have never had or wanted a sex change, etc.).  Anybody who is "different" or "feel different", gender-wise.  This includes transvestites and transsexuals.    Transsexual- an individual who feels they were born into the wrong body.  Most transsexuals take hormones and get surgery to fix this, but there are some non-op and non-hormone transsexuals who do not.      Hope that helps!|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	they are all the same|`|H5CdsnByaa	Transsexual and Transgender are basically the same thing. A transvestite is like a crossdresser.|`|x0ipxGk6aa	A transsexual is a person who feels their bodies are the exact opposite gender of who they are inside.  They usually opt for hormone therapy and sexual reconstruction surgeries.  A typical example is a "man stuck in a woman's body".    A transgendered person feels like their inner gender doesn't match their body.  They can identify as both, male and female, or as neither male nor female, or how they feel may change from moment to day to year.    A transvestite is a man who wears female clothing - and there's a million reasons for this....|`|Tq8VZzCcaa	Im confused at why people cant just be themselves, your obviously male or female for a reason.

Although 'transvestite' and 'crossdresser' are synonymous, most people use 'transvestite' to describe someone who crossdresses for sexual/fetish reasons, and 'crossdresser' for those who do so for other reasons.    'Transgender' describes a person, male or female, who dresses, behaves or presents themselves in a way that is different from their gender norm. Transgender includes transvestites/crossdressers, Drag Queens/Kings, androgynes and genderqueers.   Despite the efforts of some transgender activists to persuade the world otherwise, it does NOT include transsexual people.    'Transsexual' describes a person, male or female, born with a congenital neurological intersex condition (Benjamin's syndrome). Although transsexualism almost always requires some form of medical intervention up to and including genital surgery, it is not defined by, nor restricted to, that treatment.

If the latter, then I really don't think it is a valid point.    edit:    Couple of things. First, it is *your* opinion that he was a false messiah, according to Christianity he is *the* Messiah.

We can tell each other about our point of view, but at no time would anyone be in his/her rights to get offended by an opposing point of view.    Oh, yes, your hypothetical has occurred before and, guess what, there was no "mob scenario".

I understand that they might not believe them, but I choose to believe this. If I lived back in that time frame, I might not have been able to believe it, unless I saw a miracle performed by him. However, if I would have met him, I would have trusted him, spoken to him, and gotten to know him better. That would have made me believe in him better. I believe that he is the Son of God now, because of the Bible. Reading the Bible makes me feel secure that he is the Son of God. I wouldn't have wanted him dead, and none of the Jews should have wanted him dead either, because in the Ten Commandments, it says not to kill. I hope this information is helpful to you.|`|nGyP8YsPaa	That wouldn't make any sense first of all because Jesus is dead and he can't have a son out of the blue that would just randomly come to earth.

The period of time encompassing the birth and death of Yeshua was considered to be optimal. There were, in fact, a number of people who claimed to be the Messiah. Very few are even known today. Only one stands out. Please bear in mind that Yeshua not only said that he was the Son of God, he supported it through his teaching, and with miracles. The final proof was the Resurrection.

f0JLp4hFaa	Hi Ruby,    How did it all happen?  Bear with me, as I'm no scientist and this not easy to squeeze into a short answer.     Billions of years ago, something happened to create a group self-replicating organic molecules.  We don't know how, but there are theories, and it's been demonstrated in a lab recently.     The molecules that were better at replicating "survived" while others stopped replicating.  There was some kind of random element to this replication, so some were a teeny tiny bit different than their "parents".  Now and then these differences resulted in benefits that helped them survive to replicate more.  This went on for as long as a BILLION years, these things slowly added complexity and beneficial features through this randomness, before even the first multi-celled creatures took form.     Little by little these replicating creatures added beneficial features as they evolved to fit different environments.  At some point photosynthesis developed.  Later, once there was oxygen in the atmosphere, he ability to consume oxygen for energy also developed.  So around 1.6 million years ago, plants took one path and animals took another, around 900 million years ago early arthropods split from other animals, and so on. Bear in mind this is not an exact science yet because things didn't fossilize much back then.     Fast forward through another billion years and a few major extinctions (including the dinosaurs) to some agile little creatures in Africa.  They'd developed grasping hands for living in trees, but some of them found a better living out in the grassy plains (the forests were shrinking at that time).  Those that could stand upright for long periods of time (like you see lemurs and meerkats do today) were able to see danger and food over the grass.  Eventually natural selection favored those that could stand so much that they developed the hips, legs and balance to be bipedal all the time.     Through another 10 million years, those that stayed on the plains, little by little, got taller.  And at some point some clever critter learned that rocks and sticks made better weapons than bare hands.  Selection favored those that could use tools better than those that couldn't, and a bigger brain developed.  The bigger brain led to more complex social interactions which led to selection (natural and sexual) further favoring more intelligence.  So the steady pressure of time, variation and selection led inexorably to the development of what humans are today.     So all because of a simple mechanism (replication with randomness), a simple principle (successful organisms live to replicate, others don't), an obvious trend (useful features are retained, leading to generally increasing complexity), and LOTS and LOTS of time, we went from pre-life to humanity.     Oh, and it helped to be lucky.  We only had a few major extinctions.  Our planet has remained intact.  The Sun is fairly stable as stars go.  And we've not had any planet-frying gamma ray bursts in the past 4 billion years or so.  But since there are planets around 100 billion stars in each of 100+ billion galaxies, one or two were bound to get lucky.     I'd very much welcome anyone who can suggest improvements to this summary of evolution.

However we can show that "species" mutate over time and with enough (many, many small mutations)  eventually produce a different "species".    Edit:  The last link is a recent find of a self replicating enzyme reaction.  This is significant as it show that not only can enzymes be produced but that the reaction will use the existing enzymes as a template to produce more and will incorporate and will pass along  mutations in the enzyme.

On this earth was a soup, which evolved into rocks! These rocks evolved and evolved, becoming smaller so they could become a tiny parasite... I don't get why, size is usually a good thing, but then evolution never made sense to me!|`|AZKbJESUaa	No one knows how life started, theories are that micro-organisms hitched a ride on a comet and smashed into the earth. Or single celled organisms lived deep beneath the earth and when conditions got more survivable they came to the surface. The oldest organism ever found was a single celled organism in rocks 3.5 billion years old, the planet is 4.5 billion years old.       Organisms would eventually start to evolve due to environmental pressures. Charles Darwin was the first to talk about evolution or the first to publish it, after he seen that finches on Galapagos islands had different beaks for different jobs even thought they all came from a common ancestor.      It has been proven that all organisms carry the same genes but the sequence they appear in and for the length of time the genes are kept on and how many genes they have altogether, changes the creatures which is why we don't look like mice, As we have the same amount of genes as a mouse or close to.      The Gene that gives a Giraffe a neck is the same gene that can be found in something as small as a mouse, but the gene stays on longer for the giraffe and only a short time for the mouse.      A chicken embryo actually has a long tail like you would imagine a dinosaur having, they also have sharp teeth in the embryo stage, but these genes turn off fast and the tail no longer grows, and the teeth disappear as the rest of the beak grows. This further backs up the fact dino's were more related to birds then reptiles.     There is fossils of prehistoric fish named Tiktaalik have the same bone structure in there fins as we do in our hands. Even the genes to form there fins and our hands are the same. other fish embryos given the gene to form our hand had a major change in fin shape. Some even think this prehistoric fish might be the missing link to why life evolved on land, as it might have used these fins to get it on land to escape predators.    Whales today and dolphins have the same bony structure that looks allot like our hand.     Evolution isn't always a long process as some might think, infact there is places where it is happening before our eyes. On islands off the coast of Florida there is a large population of mice with lighter fur, opposed to the ones on the mainland with darker fur. This is a trait that has prospered on these islands because it helps hide them better from predators, as the mice live on the white sand. There are darker furred mice but because they can't hide as well they are picked off more frequently by predators. Because the light colored mice are doing so well there genes are more frequent for white fur so it has caused more white mice to be living there.

These chemicals created the perfect mix to create life and created bacteria.  These bacteria evolved into animals, plants, etc.    A good, modern day example of this is in the Berkley Pit in Butte, Montana.  It is full of all these nasty chemicals from all the mining nearby.  It was just a whole they filled with the chemicals and rain water and is obviously uninhabitable, but recently they found life forming in there from outta nowhere.  This is very similar to how life started billions of years ago.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	This is a big and complicated subject far too big to answer on this forum but there are books on it and you could try reading some of them.

AA11177614	The Bible teaches that the "soul" is you and me, the living person     Genesis 2:7  "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." KJV    1 Corinthians 15:45 "And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul" KJV    The soul can die    Ezekiel 18:4 "Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."    Various ancient religions had a view of the soul. Possibly starting from Babylon.  The Greeks, Romans, and other nations also had such ideas.     The immortal soul was added to the Christian dogma about 3 hundred years after Jesus died|`|pUIsx4Vsaa	The soul is the indestructible reality.     Theology and religion came into being when we forgot we were eternal beings.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I don't know, but that is a GREAT question.    I do know that the Ancient Egyptians had the concept, and the Greeks.    I think it comes from the basic belief in the afterlife... if you continue to live AFTER your body dies, that which continues to live on would be the soul.     The interesting point is, belief in the afterlife seems almost instinctual with humans. You can go all the way back to the early Cro-magnons and find that they put flowers in with their dead when they buried them, and some of the person's tools. One presumes that this was done (the tools would have been expensive and difficult to replace) with the idea that the person would need or want them in the afterlife...so it implies that there was a belief in an afterlife, and a soul, even back then.|`|LyZtCe4Faa	I am not sure where it began but most religions I have read about have all had the notion of an immortal soul that gets judged after death even in ancient religions we now consider mythology.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	The Greeks.

My christian friends accept that I'm a muslim, but don't really understand what islam is.  When they ask me questions it seems more that they are asking to single me out rather than because they want to be educated.  I can't talk to them about a lot of things, and vice versa because of the religion barrier.

jPt4iwICaa	They usually have a database of certified professional translators/interpreters and an equally large database of employers, i.e. companies or individuals seeking translation services in different languages. The offers are automatically sent to all the translators listed with all the job details: deadlines, price, terms of payment, specific field of translation, etc. If they're a professional, trusted and well established agency, then frauds are exposed and eliminated and both the clients and the translators are protected.   In rare cases these agencies have other agencies to act as their sub-contractors, but I think more money is lost in this way.

xxEhpytpaa	Johnny, I think I know which book you are looking for but, I have so many that it might take a while to locate it. Is it the one that describes why during the Latin Mass we blessed ourselves 33 time in honor of the years of Jesus' life.  let me know and in the meantime I'll locate as many books on the Mass as I have OK. God bless you.    So far I have "Mass" confusion by Atkins, "How Christ said the First Mass" by Fr. James Meagher, DD. This particular book described the origins of all the vessels and movements that were done in the Mass and why. From the candles and vestments used to why they place their hands a certain way.  It is quite a large book with 438 pages. This might be what you are looking for. I know I have More but, It will take a bit more time to find them.

"How Christ celebrated the first Mass"  438 pages.  https://www.tanbooks.com/index.php/page/...    if you want the origins of the Novus Ordo, you don't have to go far.  Just to 1962 and Vatican II.

HsT9sW5Xaa	They can, but not that way. You're safe from that guy, so don't worry.     The only way they can is if you, for example, sent him an email message. He could then trace your I.P to your town/city, but you would probably need permission from the ISP of the person for a specific address(which wouldn't happen). Any shared connection also can allow him to track your IP (ie. through limewire, or a sharing program) or if he was somehow able to embed an IP logger, which I doubt.     Try to be more careful. You never know who you could be interacting with online. Regardless, that guy probably won't stalk you.

Hfej50Uhaa	Bigot is a loaded term, and quite a negative one, so one doesn't usually think of him or herself as bigoted.  The dictionary refers to "a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed, belief, or opinion", and that uses another loaded word, "intolerant", which most people also do not ascribe to themselves.  Likewise when someone thinks someone else bigoted, it can be for as small a reason as they do not agree with your opinion, your creed, your belief, and often represents a judgement.    But, the internet is a big place, and audacious behaviour gets noticed, so I don't doubt that there are people who profess to be "proud to be a bigot".  Indeed googling that term gets you over 1700 answers, including some Y!A :-)|`|IVy35SE2aa	They don't think of themselves as bigots, but as thinkers.  some times they are both.

One person's bigotry might be another person's freedom of expression.

Only other people who disagree with their stance would classify them as bigots (and they could equally expect to be thought of as bigots themselves).

Someone who is a "bigot" usually is someone who has very little knowledge about the spiritual portion of life that we live in. They are the tainted offspring of the world and they do not know what they do, as Jesus said to those who hung him on the cross.    It is better to look at someone like that and weep inside for them, say a quick prayer in your heart and move on. Do not contend with someone who is foolish, then you are made to be their equal. Pray inside for them, because as the word says, God is able to judge the thoughts of man as well.    Eat, sleep and drink of the Lord!

As long as the teacher is there to teach the information in a secular way, the religion of the teacher is irrelevant to me.

The ironic thing is that the hijab was the women's idea. Before, the women were just kept at home because they didn't want other men looking at their beauty. With the hijab, though, they could go out to the city, go to school, get jobs, and enjoy other such freedoms. I think they take it off whenever they are in an environment where there are no men, such as in a classroom or women's health spa. So the teacher of an elementary school class would probably doff the hijab when teaching.    The Quran does not demand that the women were hijabs and burqas. It just states that they should be modestly dressed.|`|AA12360579	I wouldn't care what religious garb the teacher was wearing.    I'd prefer that the teacher wouldn't dress too provocatively if I had a son and he was between ages 10-17.|`|0JE41mXsaa	It wouldn't bother me if the teacher was good at their job.      My child is going to grow up in a multi-cultural society; including Muslim, Heathen, Buddist, etc.  having belief's different to my own doesn't make someone a bad person or bad at their job.    The fine line is - in this example - if the teacher started to preach Islam to my child.  Children are impressionable and inclined to love and trust the adults around them.  I would prefer for my child not be confused, but exposed to alternate religions when age-appropriate.  i.e. they can reason on their own.|`|uNu7b21baa	Just fine|`|zuEDPWRraa	I would have no problem with that.

fvRYQlSLaa	Aw that's so cute! What a sweet idea! Um.. one thought though keep in mind how you're planning on sending the kit because chocolate melts so just a thought. Maybe on the cd you can include some songs that remind you of your relationship (like if you have "your song") and as cheesy and corny as it is you could include those little hearts that have the cute little messages on them. You could also include a homemade card with a cheesy saying from you and maybe put the pictures into a little photo album. Another thing you could do is (if he has access to a computer) give him a webcam and get one for you so you could almost actually "be together" on Valentine's Day. Hope it works out for you :)

OfeCeEvqaa	There is no such thing as a "saved Christian" and and being unrepentant. Every born again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ has repented of sin and purposes in their heart to not continue in sin. This is not to say that Christians don't sin, but only that after the commission of sin they must immediately repent and ask for forgiveness. The apostle Peter describes the fate of those who continue in sin after professing faith in the Lord.    2 Peter 2: 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.     21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.     22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.    the problem with all the sin and sinning in the world, and especially in the Professed Church, is the entire neglect of truly abiding in the Living God. "No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Luke 16:13). Somehow, we have falsely been given the impression that we can still be a Good Person even though we are presently engaged in evil actions. Jesus made the opposite abundantly clear. "16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them" (Matthew 7:16-20). "Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit" (Matthew 12:33).     If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the Truth" (1John 1:6). If we allow ourselves to be deceived that Church Members can be considered Good, while engaging in all the selfish activities of lying, cheating, stealing, lust, fornication, adultery, divorce, gluttony, drunkenness, greed, bitterness, gossip, homosexuality, witchcraft, slothfulness, disobedience to parents, etc., then why should it be thought strange, when we find that the stalkers, serial killers, mass murderers, cannibals, sadistic torturers, pornographers, child abusers, drug kingpins, robber barons, and global demagogues, have or had a Church Background-- complete with a Bible in their hands? "15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the Will of God abideth for ever" (1John 2:15-17).      gatita_63109|`|tX57rwksaa	As a practising medium since 1991 i truly believe that there is no hell as we envisage it; because in death we all go into another dimension and there we are sorted and re-educated before being moved on.   A quote says " I n my Father`s house there are many mansions".   If we have sinned that is where we create our own hell.   We learn from passed people reporting back through guides.|`|OUCVY4kdaa	"Saved, yet unrepentant sinners"??????    That's quite an oxymoron you've got going there.    Yeshua (jesus) said that we could tell a tree by its fruit.  So if they have never repented, and their fruit is constant sin, it appears they were never truly saved to begin with.  Saying some "repeat after me" incantation saves no one!|`|iHDYncuXaa	Nope. Once saved always saved. Unrepentant sinners usually aren't saved!|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	First, I believe that the phrase "saved unrepentant sinners" is an oxymoron, meaning that it is contradictory.    No one should be called "saved" if they are unrepentant sinners.    And this comes from someone who embraces no religion and chooses to be called Agnostic.  So take it any way you want.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Saved unrepentant is an oxymoron.    you can be saved, and sin, then die, and you will go to heaven if that is what you mean because Christ died for future sins as well as past.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	I don't believe there is such a thing as an saved unrepentant sinner.

AA10055448	No  (to the first question in bold).. ..    While he is free to research the matter, a typical Jehovah's Witness is already well aware that many of Russell's beliefs were wrong or insufficiently developed. Isn't it dishonest and picayunish to slander a man dead nearly a century? The fact remains that more than a century ago, Russell recognized the Bible truths that hell is not hot, that the soul is not immortal, that God has a personal name, that Jesus is not Jehovah, that most humans will be resurrected as humans, and that God's Messianic Kingdom will restore paradise to earth and end the suffering of humankind.    Those ideas remain tightly and uniquely identified with Jehovah's Witnesses.    Furthermore, Jehovah's Witnesses have never pretended to be followers of Charles Russell any more than they pretended to be followers of Paul or Apollos or Cephas or of ANYONE but Christ Jesus. When seven million Jehovah's Witnesses preach from door to door each month, they work to preach the "good news about the Christ".  .. ..(1 Corinthians 1:12-17) What I mean is this, that each one of you says: I belong to Paul, But I to Apollos, But I to Cephas, ...Paul was not impaled for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? ...Christ dispatched me, not to go baptizing, but to go declaring the good news    Consider again the questioner's smears, and consider whether her whines might also apply to other prominent Christians who lived during times that truths were unfolding. Consider the apostle Peter!    The apostle Peter explicitly told Jesus that Jesus wouldn't have to suffer and die!  .. ..(Matthew 16:22-23) Peter took him aside...saying: Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all. But, turning his back, he said to Peter: Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not Gods thoughts, but those of men.    The apostle Peter was likely among those who thought God's Kingdom involved Israel's governmental independence from Rome.  .. ..(Acts 1:2,6) [Jesus] had given commandment through holy spirit to the apostles whom he chose. ...When, now, they had assembled, they went asking him: Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?    The apostle Peter likely died still teaching that the apostle John would never die. It was decades before John himself formally corrected that wrong idea.  .. ..(John 21:21-23) Peter said to Jesus: Lord, what will [John] do? Jesus said to him: If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you? You continue following me. In consequence, this saying went out among the brothers, that that disciple [John] would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die      The questioner is foisting a dishonest and petty line of reasoning. She should perhaps use her energies as Christ directed, in the house to house preaching work. Is she not embarassed that the Christians she chooses to criticize are those who are actually obeying the Scriptural command to preach the "good news"?  .. ..(Matthew 10:7,11,14) As you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near. ...Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving... Wherever anyone does not take you in or listen to your words, on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off your feet.  .. ..(Mark 6:10-11) [Jesus] said to them: Wherever you enter into a home, stay there until you go out of that place. And wherever a place will not receive you nor hear you, on going out from there shake off the dirt that is beneath your feet for a witness to them.  .. ..(Luke 10:1-5) [Jesus] the Lord designated seventy others and sent them forth by twos in advance of him into every city and place to which he himself was going to come. Then he began to say to them: The harvest, indeed, is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. Go forth. ...Wherever you enter into a house say first, May this house have peace.  .. ..(Acts 5:42) And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.  .. ..(Acts 20:18-21) I was with you [fellow Christians] the whole time, slaving for the Lord with the greatest lowliness of mind...while I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house. But I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.   .. ..(Matthew 24:14;28:19-20) [Jesus said] And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations... Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded  .. ..(Romans 10:8-10) The word is near you, in your own mouth and in your own heart; that is, the word of faith, which we are preaching. For if you publicly declare that word in your own mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.|`|cR8UZdi1aa	As all the JW's have said already, NO we're not at all discouraged to read up on the history of JW's.     Your Non-Witness answerer's have been responding like they really know what we think. They're obviously mislead or trying to mislead. They don't know what they're talking about. But you already know that, don't you?    If you really wanted to know the answer, you'd ask a JW personally, but you don't really want to know what JW's think, and we all know your true intentions.|`|AA11025703	The simple answer to your question, is NO.  We are certainly not discouraged from knowing the history of our faith, and in turn the progress we've made since then.|`|9Dq2176oaa	Whats to hide? That he's not perfect! We already knew that.|`|AA12073868	No it's not true.     Many of us have publications going back to Russell's writings.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	No it's not true    ..but of course, you'll believe what you want to believe no matter what we say|`|0aN1xIxfaa	There's no need for them to be discouraged. They have far too much on their plates, keeping up with current literature, door-knocking, assemblies, meetings, talks, studies etc to do more than glance at ye olde ancient literature (that most of them do not have anyway). And, if their leaders warned them not to read that stuff, guess what many of them would want to do?    What their leaders have done is provide their own history book of the movement. Selected quotes from old literature are given, explanations offered about difficulties way back then, and it appears there is a seamless transition from Russell to the 21st century. Amazing.    The success of this tactic is displayed in one answerer stating, "Russell did not delve a lot into chronology." Astonishing! Russell was consumed with chronology! So were most Protestants in the 1800s, in America and Britain. Great numbers of books were distributed, by Adventists in particular, interpreting prophecies to work out dates and when Christ would return. The Adventist Uriah Smith wrote a 700 page book in 1906 saying Christ had returned invisibly in 1884. Sounds familiar? He was furthering Adventist Jonas Wendell's views and Russell heard Wendell in 1870. Russell also got ideas from Barbour, who got his ideas from William Miller, who got more ideas from James Hatley Frere (who, in 1815 published a spiritual return of Christ in 1822/3). If JWs just checked the history of Millennialism in the 1800s, they would be disabused of the notion that Russell was inspired by God to proclaim new truths and to re-establish the true church.    If any JWs doubt this, I recommend they don't take my word for it but obtain the book below (a mere 144 pages) and get themselves educated. Then they can make up their own minds about Russell.|`|FK3lCrUaaa	Most of Russell's writings are discouraged because they view most of his beliefs as old light (aka false teachings). They will still quote him (most likely out of context) or make reference when they are being less then honest about their history.|`|yz6qXwUiaa	We aren't followers of a man.  Russell was simply a man, and he was a man who was used by God to accomplish a great deal of good in his lifetime.  Never the less those were very early days for us.  Times when we didn't have anywhere near as clear of an understanding of the Bible as we do now.  Russell was right on a lot of things and wrong on a lot.    I don't OWN any of Russells books they have been out of print for some time now, but noone has discouraged us from reading them if we could find them.  I had a friend who had a copy of the 7th volume of "Studies in the Scriptures".  The one that was banned, the one that caused so much anger among the churches that they organized themselves and sent our brothers to jail.    Obviously this was a precious possession of the sister who shared it with me and I wouldn't dream of asking her to borrow it, but I did look it over and I found some things in there that  I know we no longer believe.  Does that surprise me?    No not really.  Does it bother me? no not at all.  Why? Well you have to consider that for centuries "weeds" had been growing in among the wheat of true Christianity.  False teachings had just about obscurred the truth.  When Russell first started studying the Bible along with the Bible Students, they had a LOT of falsehoods to root out of their hearts and minds and out of their belief systems.  That takes time.    Even today when we have so much Bible truth, if we study with a new one it takes time for us to help them see what the Bible teaches. and for some of them they have a very hard time letting go of the false things they've always been taught.    So for Russell and his associates to get it all right immediately? THAT would have been surprising.    From what I understand Russell came from a background of religious beliefs that believed in pre-destination (a form of Calvinism).  His early religious training taught that people were destined to hell from before they were born and that an all knowing God knew in advance they were going there.  For him this whole concept was appalling.  He could not in his heart accept that God is loving, just or wise if he would set up such a system that gives no one the freedom to choose whether to be good or not and yet punishes them for being bad.    In searching the scriptures therefore he had a LOT of falsehoods to get rid of.  He certainly found out early on that God does not predestine people.  And that the teaching of hellfire is not scriptural.  Some of the other falsehoods took longer to root out, but he was searching and he was digging into God's word to find the answers.  With such sincerity, who could ask for anything more?  True he didn't immediately have it all correct, but because he started to ask the questions others came after him and continued asking the questions.  Now our understanding of the Bible is much closer to what God intended and any "new light" we get now is on minor points usually.  The doctrines are all clearly defined.    I wouldn't object to reading his original writings if I could find them, but I wouldn't expect them to be as accurate as what we have now.  What I would be searching for is what he had RIGHT at such an early stage.  And I'm sure I would be impressed by that.|`|XbuvO2DLaa	I was never told "not to."  Nor discouraged.  I was given the books,   so I could read up on the history of the faith of my choice.  This implies, that I was encouraged to read about the founding /  beginnings of Jehovah's Witness.  I was never  "overly interested"    in brother Russell's beginnings and the Bible Students.  I accept Amos 3:7 for what it is.   Jehovah chose a man*,   to use to bring new light to those who are lovers of truth.  For those who want to know and serve Jehovah, the God.  That's all I need.    * This certainly was Not the first time   Jehovah chose a man, to do His will.  To help guide the people of the nations to Jehovah.

I have and have read Russell's "Studies in the Scriptures" volumes.  Some of Jehovah's Witnesses even have their own sites on the Internet about Brother Russell and his teachings.  I'm not talking about Bible Students' sites, but sites also by Jehovah's Witnesses, such as this one:    http://pastorrussell.blogspot.com    We have nothing to hide, because we already realize that our people are as imperfect as everyone else, and we admit that we have made mistakes and have entertained hopes that are not yet realized.    But we continue on with what has been established as true.  And in harmony with Jesus' commands, we continue to "keep on the watch" for Jehovah's great Day.  We continue to keep active in the work that the Lord Jesus Christ gave to all Christians to do.|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    Others have answered this question quite adequately. I would just like to give my own personal example. I have a personal library of over 1500 books. I have over 350,000 documents on my computer ranging from one page to 10 volumes. Most are on the original languages or religious history. Very few are written by JW's so most of them do not agree with the Witness's doctrine.    Additionally, while other religious groups discourage their members from talking to Witnesses, JWs are expected and encouraged to talk to people of all beliefs. Anyone who has been a Witness for any length of time has heard these accusations against our beliefs and history and personally have examined the facts. Some may personally choose not to even discuss them further, but I and many others have no problem repeatedly disproving them.    Hope this helps,    Ron Rhoades|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	The JW organization published an "official" history book of themselves a little more than a decade ago called "Jehovah's Witnesses- Proclaimers of God's Kingdom". JWs refer to it as the "Proclaimers" book. . It is through this publication that all JWs are to learn about the organization's past history. This book only touches on SOME of the organizations most embarrassing moments and gives vague excuses for the ones it does address. As with all of their literature, if a JW does not accept the excuses and explanations given in this book and goes to outside sources, then they are considered to have a bad attitude, possibly even to the point of being called "apostate".   Any outside sources of information that are critical of the organization or that uncover parts of its history that they desire to remain hidden is also considered by them as "apostate".     See the September 2007 "Our Kingdom Ministry" Question Box article for more details. There, JWs are told to use ONLY the organization's literature for Bible research and discourages any meetings, websites, or literature "that is not produced or organized under its oversight." They are a bunch of scam artists and false prophets and they know it! They just don't want their 7 million contributor$ to know it- their means of living depends on it!|`|AA11177614	NO WE ARE NOT discouraged from learning about JW history.    many Kingdom halls have in their libraries the old publications for C T Russell.    Russell did not formulate the idea that Jesus returned in 1874. He was persuaded to believe that by a Mr Barbour a second Adventist preacher. He joined with Mr Barbour in publishing the information.  It was not long before they parted company.      I have done a lot of research using old watchtowers going back to the first issue and many of Russell books. I can tell you with a certainty that the opponents of JWs that point to old material do NOT tell the full picture.  There is much published about Russell that is NOT true and often comes form out side sources that have not properly checked court records  or old Publications.    We can by all means look up for our selves what was actually written. We are warned about reading any Russell material and from my research now know why.    Anti Russell material can and most often, sound authentic but is rubbish regurgitated by people that have just thought someone else had done the research.    EDIT    You are correct Russell did not give up his belief in 1874.  That is because from the information he had at that time 1874 seemed to have been supported by the chronology that was presented to him.  Russell did not delve a lot into chronology.  That was not his thing.    Russell and Barbour broke up because of a difference in belief over the value of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus. Barbour denied that Christ died to atone for our sins. This was obnoxious to Russell.|`|MlvNl26vaa	Cop-out alert! "We aren't followers of a man."    Yet they take their marching orders from the pres of their watch tower of babel...

ktqroat6aa	well one stereotype i no of is jewish people being very attached to money. this stereotype actually goes back to hitler germany when jewish people were forced to work as banks and tax collectors even though it was against their religion because all other forms of jewish work was at that point made illegal. however, this is a stereotype that has unfortunately stuck.     some other stereotypes may include things about a jewish persons appearance, which may or may not be true and has probably originated from the way most jewish people did look. example all asians have black hair is a stereotype of the way asians look but may have originated from a truth|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Intellectual.

Got laughed at just yesterday when I refused to eat collard greens with pork in it.(I live in the south).  I dont judge others or laugh at them just because they drive to church on sundays or something like that.   This is not intended to poke fun at Christians or anything like that; but these are the situations I deal with.  I guess the stereotype of thinking WE think we are 'better' than the rest has originated since the Torah(or the OT). When G-d chose the nation of Isreal to make a covenant with. He did try to choose other nations first, but no one else made the covenant with Him. This does not mean we are better, it just means we have to fullfill the covenant and follow a slightly different doctrine than the rest.

These can apply to anyone. Stereotyping is racist, however the sad fact is that most of the stereotypes placed within a minority or race has some truth behind it. The key is to draw a line, and to use it only as humorous, to laugh with the stereotype, not because of it.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Look up classical antisemitism/Christian antisemitism.    Fireball just demonstrated it, albeit in a 'complimentary' fashion.  I recommend Fireball read this:    http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?...    At few persistent anti-Semitic themes exist:    * Jews Have Excessive Power    Anti-Semites have long spoken of a Jewish conspiracy controlling the U.S. government. This was apparent in a May 2002 Survey of Anti-Semitism in America, which also found that 20 percent of the American public agrees that, "Jews have too much power in the U.S. today."    * Jews Are Not Loyal    According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), one-third of Americans still accept the notion that Jews have "dual loyalties." Such charges of disloyalty were the fuel behind anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia and the Holocaust in Europe.    * Jews Act Not As Individuals but in Conspiracy    *Rich    *Smart/cunning    *Greedy    I learned all these from TV stereotypes and studying literature regarding antisemitic propaganda from early Christianity and thru Nazism.      To answer the last part of your question, no I don't believe these stereotypes to be true.  If I meet a greedy Jewish person, I would put it down to greed, not Judaism.  Same would go for a greedy Sikh or Hindu or Wiccan person.|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	One is that Jewish people are extreamly cheap|`|RyOWcmlvaa	cheap, big nosed, rich, jappy.  if they are hysidic (spelling?) jews, they generally smell like ***.|`|cj4nIaQTaa	Everyone in Hollywood is jewish.

It seems to me that many, if not all Jews in history have been just like that, so maybe that's where the stereotype came from.|`|XjLmgPIoaa	Are you kidding me? You're really asking people to perpetuate stereotypes? Have you noticed that no one is saying what they think of these? No one is condemning them? Only stating all the dirty untrue b.s. that is regurgetated over & over again? This is the type of b.s. that allows it to be ok to spread hate.  This question is horrible. Maybe you don't realize that it is potentially very offensive & you should do the right thing & delete it.      Edit- Well if you're Jewish yourself then shame on you for asking this. Or for at least phrasing it the way you did. You're pretty much saying, hey, spread all the b.s. that is said about us that you know are just that, stereotypes. You know that YA! is like open season for spreading hate, why give people a free ride to do it? It seems like common sense to me. If you were truly curious, maybe you should have stuck to asking where and how stereotypes are formed, but I really see no point in asking people to point them all out one by one.    Edit - To Torrian, "and in all likelihood they're true". In all likelihood you're super dense. "Not willing to take risks. Bitches and complains alot. Beady eyes." Man, my eyes are so beady I might as well make a necklace out of them. Get your laughs buddy. Or do yourself a favor & change your thinking. As diplomatic as you try to make yourself sound, you sure express the exact opposite.

They articulate language as to create many possibility's so it seems like they made a certain prediction yet that prediction could apply to many things.

One test involved a machine with to lights that would randomly turn on and off and not at the same time. After many thousands of repetitions ruining the machine the expected outcome would be that the lights would show a fifty fifty chance of lighting and of course it was. However when someone (anyone) would come into the room with nothing more than instruction to change the outcome in favour of one light with their will slight deviations would appear. The machines were tested by themselves again and would return to a fifty fifty chance. If I remember right women were more successful than men and some people were not successful at all. There were many other experiments but this was the only one I felt had a real control which if you understand science is important when testing a hypothesis.

Firstly I will try to cut a long explanation short by telling you people are made fo three elements you are a spirit wearing a body that owns a mind and heart.  So basically you are a walking talking spirit nd the thing you see in the mirrow every day is the body that covers your spirit, you  then access your head to work things out and your heart to feel emotions.    What makes psycis different from you is they have learnt to control their spiririts better than you, they have learnt to live out of their spirits better than you who would live out of your body heart/soul and mind, like other people.     Part 2  There are a few ways for you to access your spirit or to operate out of your spirit, the main one being if you become a christian your spirit comes alive and God teaches you how to operate your spirit and learn to live by your spirit more than your body so your power comes from your spirit more than your body mind and heart, the second way is the way psycics do it, they have contact with other spirits and basically speak to other spirits using their spirit.    You need to know the following, every person born has a spirit that follows them I call these spirits watching spirits as all they do is watch you, from the day you are born till the day you die all they do is watch you, they watch your responses they see what you do, they see the events of your life and all they do is watch you.  When a psycic enters the spirit world to see about ievents in your life they speak to these "watching" spirits and ask them stuff, depending on how much spiritual power the psycic has it will vary in what it tells the psycic.  Christians too have an equivalent, before they are born the spirit of God watches them and keeps an eye on them, then from the day they are born He follows them, listens to what they say , their responses and reactions and moves accordingly.  When a Christian accepts Jesus one of the gifts they get is called "a word of knowlege" which means when they yield their spirit to God's spirit He tells them stuff about their future directly or in dream or in visions or in words sometimes just one or two but the word is so powerful you must do it as your future depends on it.    So the question now is who do you want to hear from?  Psycics will tell you what you want to know but remember one thing there is a price to pay for spiritual power and spiritual knowlege you will pay in the flesh but you will also pay in the spirit, you cannot ask spirits for knowlege for free the psycic charges and the spirits that give the info charges.  Jesus charges too it costs you your life with Him you have to hand it over to Him so basically you can choose to hand yourself over to the mercy of psycics and their spirits or to Jesus and His Spirit.    I must warn you if you do choose the road of psycics you will never be free as you have yeilded your spirit to them you are theirs, if that touch you and you feel a really warm/hot feeling coming from their hand please understand this is them moving their spirit and connecting to your spirit you will not be free spiritually after that.     Choose wisely at least now you know your choices
C1IwpPwPaa	The true faithful Muslim believes in the following Principal articles of faith:-  1. He believes in One God 'Allah', Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and Mighty, Merciful and Compassionate, Creator and Provider.  2. He believes in all Messengers of God without any discrimination among them. Every known nation had a warner or Messenger from God. They were chosen by God to teach mankind and deliver His divine message. The Quran mentions the name of twenty five of them. Among them Mohammad stands as the last Messenger and the crowning glory of the foundation of Prophethood.  3. Muslim believes in all scriptures and revelations of God. They were the guiding light which the Messengers received to show their respected peoples the Right Path of God. In the Quran a special reference is made to the books of Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. But long before the revelations has been lost or corrupted. The only authentic and complete book of God in existence in the Quran.  4. The true Muslim believes in the Angels of Allah. They are purely spiritual and splendid beings whose nature requires on food, drink or sleep. They spend their days and nights in the worship of God.  5. Muslim believes in the last Day of Judgement. This world will come to an end someday, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and fair trial. People with good records will be generously, rewarded and warmly welcomed to the Heaven of Allah, and those with bad records will be punished and cast into Hell.  6. Muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of God and His power to plan and execute His planes and nothing could happen in His Kingdom against His will. His knowledge and power are in action at all times and command over His creation. He is wise and merciful, and whatever He does must have a meaningful purpose. If this is established in our mind and hearts, we should accept with good faith all that He does, although we may fail to under stand it fully, or think it is bad.   Faith without actions arid practice is a dead end, as far as Islam is concerned. Faith by nature is very sensitive and can be most effective. When it is not out of practice or out of use, it quickly loses its liveliness and motivation power.  There are five pillars of Islam:   1. The declaration of faith: To bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Mohammad (PBUH) is His Messenger to all human beings till the Day of Judgment. The Prophethood of Mohammad obliges the Muslims to follow, His exemplary life as a model.  2. Prayers: Daily, prayers are offered five times a day as a duty towards Allah. They strengthen and enliven the belief in Allah and inspire man to a higher morality. They purify the heart and prevent temptation towards wrong - doings and evil.  3. Fasting the month of Ramadan. The Muslims during the month of Ramadan not only abstain from food, drink and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset but also sincerity and devotion. It develops a sound social conscience, patience, unselfishness and will - Power.  4. Zakkah: The literal and simple meaning of Zakkah is purity. The technical meaning of this word designates the annual amount in kind or coin which a Muslim with means must distribute among the rightful beneficiaries. But the religious and spiritual significance of Zakkah is much deeper and more lively. So it has humanitarian and sociopolitical values.  5. Hajj (Pilgrimage to Makkah): It is to be performed once in a lifetime, if one can afford it financially and physically.   your guide to Islam: http://www.islam-guide.com/frm-ch3-11.ht...

It actually means a way of life. So Islam is a way of life whr u get peace by submitting your will to the One who has created u, The Almighty God.   Islam stands on 5 principles,           1) To believe & declare that there are no Gods worthy of worship but One God[ALLAH] & Muhammad(peace be upon Him) is the messenger of God.           2) To pray 5 times a day called SAL AH           3) To fast during the month of Ramadan           4) To give Zakaat(obligatory charity by the rich) to the poor.           5) To perform pilgrimage to Mecca.|`|SXZfntmUaa	There are 5 Pillars of Islam.   Each 5 pillars is a good strong deed.   It is a religion of peace and patience.   It guides you and shows you the right path.   We also believe that Muhammad (pbuh) Was our Messenger and was a good perfect person who helped others and cared for others, so therefore we must follow his teaching told by Allah.   Their are many reason why Allah sent us here is to see do we strongly believe in him, please him and to show him we care for our one another,  to see do we have patience.......  After the day of Resurrection we go Jannah if only we have done enough good deeds to go to go inshallah. The sinners will go to the hell fire if they do not do their 5 pillars.

Fast during Ramadan  ?? Pilgrimage to Hajj.        We believe in Heaven & Hell.    To get to Heaven, one must:  ?? Believe in Allah  ?? Believe in the Prophets  ?? Believe in the Qur'an  ?? Believe in the Day of Judgment  ?? Do good deeds  ?? Pray to God and ask for forgiveness from sins  ?? Pay charity    To get to Hell is quite easy:  ?? No belief in God  ?? No belief in the Qur'an  ?? A polytheist  ?? One who does not ask for forgiveness from sins and keeps repeating them.    When someone dies, you do not right away go to Heaven or Hell; this is what happens:    ?? Its called Barzakh; you will remain in the grave.  ?? An Angel wakes your soul and asks you questions  ?? Based on how you answer, it will determine whether you lie in your grave peacefully or harshly.  ?? You are put back to sleep  ?? Then after everyone has died, there will come the Day of Resurrection where all the souls will be awakened.  ?? Everyone will appear before God and be asked about their deeds and what they did.  ?? Everyone will be put where they deserve: Heaven or Hell    Check this out as well:  http://rawkurdi.wordpress.com/category/i...

SubhanAllahi wa bihamdihi.|`|ij5Sv6staa	I believe Islam is a counterfeit religion meant to distract from the only way of salvation--Jesus Christ, Son of God.  Mohammad is a false prophet because Islam does not accept that Jesus is the son of God.  Islam teaches that Jesus was only a great prophet and not the Son of God, but Jesus must be the son of God, here is the reasoning:    1) either Jesus is who he says he is, the Son of God, and Islam is wrong.  or  2) Jesus was a raving lunatic. For no great prophet of God would also blaspheme God by declaring himself the Son of God.  Jesus cannot be a great prophet and a great liar at the same time!!!    We KNOW Mohammad is a false prophet because he denies Jesus is the son of God, here is the test:  1 John 4:1-3  1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.     2 Corinthians 11:13-15  13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.    However, Jesus himself declared before multiple witnesses that he is the son of God (Jesus cannot be a great prophet if he also blasphemes God):    Matthew 26:63-64    63But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ,[a] the Son of God." 64"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."    Mark 14:61-62   61But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ,[a] the Son of the Blessed One?" 62"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."    Luke 22:70  70They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?"  He replied, "You are right in saying I am."    John 4:25-26  The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us." Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."    John 10:25-30   25Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me, 26but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. 27My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 28I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. 29My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all[d]; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. 30I and the Father are one."     John 17:1-5   After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.|`|digPrN5Saa	Peace    Hello  Shade.  This website will help.  Look at the left of your screen on topics.  http://www.islamreligion.com/
jbDTsZyBaa	I didn't. I saw no reason to mutilate my sons because of society's expectations. That is the number one reason why American parents have it done: So their sons will look like everyone elses. They do not need it for health reasons. It isn't difficult to keep an uncircumcised penis clean.    Circumcision can cause sexual difficulties. Many men choose to have foreskin restoration to ease the pain and stop the deformities that a too close circumcision can cause. Circumcision also causes loss of sensation even when done 'properly'.    I bet most of you don't know that foreskins are sold for profit to pharmaceutical and reasearch companies. Which wouldn't be so bad if they were removed from consenting adults, not helpless babies.  http://www.foreskin.org/f4sale.htm|`|EPaYoJaiaa	Because of a misconception that it's easier to keep clean and it's healthier and the constant pressure from society that no one can escape to 'look like everyone else'  I completely agree with you. My nephew who is 9, my ex who is now 25 and my godson who is 3 all are uncirumsisized NONE of them have had problems with it, my sister and my best friend have had no problems keeping their sons clean my nephew since he was potty trained has had no problems keeping it clean, my ex kept it clean just fine, this might be tmi, but I was completely satisfied with my ex-boyfriend when we were together. (a penis is ugly either way lol) There is NO reason to circumsize. BUT I will not look down on any mother that does decide to do it, she has her reasons and it does not predict how good of a parent she will be in the future.    @Vee: WOW defensive much? ask around most STRAIGHT females thinks a penis is ugly, doesn't mean I'm not attracted to men, or I don't enjoy sex. excuse me for liking someone for who they are rather than the attractiveness of their genitals (btw: vaginas aren't all that pretty either)    Well I'm sorry that my and a few of my friends opinions differs from your many many friends but that does not mean I should just swing the other way again I go by who a person is not the attractiveness of genitals. Just the way I am I guess.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	Because women don't find un-cut men cute.|`|hkvWDU3xaa	dates back to biblical times. The Jews were told to circusize their children to distinquish them as Jews|`|4Za1utmCaa	Originally, circumcision was a Jewish tradition that was thought to curb sexual arousal and help preserve the male chastity vow. Later on, it became more of a cleanliness thing, which is mostly untrue. The uncircumcised are really no more unclean than the circumcised.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	It's a sick ancient islamic/jewish practice and in north america it is fear based. It went from lessening the joy of masturbating to now fear of what the girls might think and bs warstories about how all natural un-circumcized guys walk around bend over in pain with their penis half way off due to an infection because they weren't circumcised. Foreskin is there for a reason so let it the f be before thinking about infliciting shock inducing pain on a helpless baby boy.    SICK!|`|b25a74469233f38d4ab50bb09a3c6f0caa	BOYs need it more for health reasons, and for more cleanliness under that skin, it might also greatly help prevent contracting sexually transmitted diseases.

EDIT - Joe B were those surveys carried out by the church/religious organisation by any chance ;)|`|ssK4oJi9aa	christians are more sympathetic to one another more so than atheists are sympathetic to one another because atheists do not reserve their sympathy for fellow atheists but are sympathetic to all alike.|`|pO8OzblHaa	Because they think the person in distress did something to deserve to be in the situation that they're in.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Yay for made up "facts" !

Christians attack everyone, even each other.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Because to a small level Atheists are more used to using their head than their feelings, I guess.     But it's not that big of a difference I would think.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	Because misery likes company.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	91 percent of Christians give to charity  66 percent of atheists give to charity.    Conservatives give more money to charity than Liberals.    67 percent of Christians volunteer.  44 percent of atheists volunteer.    Conservatives volunteer more than Liberals.    Christian families give $2,210 to charity each year.  Atheists families give $642 to charity each year.  Christians give away more money and more time when comparing any income level.    71 percent of Chrsitian families give to 'secular' charities.  61 percent of atheists families give to 'secular' charities.    Conservatives give more to secular charities than Liberals..    60 percent of Christians volunteer for 'secular' causes.  39 percent of atheists volunteer for 'secular' causes.    Conservatives volunteer more for secular causes than Liberals.    Christians give $532 to 'secular' charities each year.  Atheists $467 to 'secular' charities each year.    Christians give more blood than atheists.  Christians are more likely to help the 'homeless' with food or money.  Christians are more likely to return excess change to a cashier.  Red states(conservative) give away more money than blue states(liberal) despite lower incomes.    In light of the above it is interesting to note that;    (1) A higher percent of Liberals than conservatives believe that the income discrepency is too large between the poor and rich.  (2) A higher percent of Liberals than conservatives believe that the government should do more to reduce the income discrepency.  (3) A higher percent of Liberals than conservatives believe that we have become a society of 'have' and 'have nots'.    Even deducting church tithing, Christians give more than atheists.  Of 15 large studies being studied and combined it has been shown that that in no measurable way are Liberal atheists more charitable  than Christian Conservatives.  In fact, of all of the demographic groups studied it is the Liberal atheists who give the least time and money than anyone else.  Yet it is the Liberal secularists that complain into perpetuaity about the plight of the poor and that 'somebody' should do something about it!  Overall it is the Liberal atheists that enjoy the highest incomes only to consume their wealth upon their own lusts thus proving out their error.|`|BNHocZaiaa	Because we aren't whiners.|`|PcNzgisHaa	OMG!!

Just like the Bible said thousands of years ago.    1 Corinthians 1  21  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,     Matthew 11:25  At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.    2 Corinthians 4:4  The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.     Luke 8  9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 10 He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,     "though seeing, they may not see;  though hearing, they may not understand.'

I don't know why most other cultures don't use water to clean themselves after using the toilet, but I do know that many people do carry around wet wipes to clean themselves with afterwards.      I grew up in America and it is not our culture to use water afterwards. I have no idea why and didn't even know other cultures did until I met my Muslim husband.  He told me it was part of their culture and religion and I started doing it.  Now I carry wet wipes with me.  I also noticed that when he showered he used a cloth that was a little rough to wash with to get all the dead skin off his body, that also is not part of my culture, but made a lot of sense.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	That is so wrong, because i take a bath every day.

Imbolc is the day the Cailleach  the hag goddess  gathers Her firewood for the rest of the winter. Legend has it that if she intends to make the winter last a good while longer, she will make sure the weather on Imbolc is bright and sunny, so she can gather plenty of firewood. Therefore, people are generally relieved if Imbolc is a day of foul weather, as it means the Cailleach is asleep and winter is almost over. On the Isle of Man, where She is known as Caillagh ny Groamagh, the Cailleach is said to have been seen on Imbolc in the form of a gigantic bird, carrying sticks in her beak.

v0BCIQpnaa	Did she really reveal the secrets of your heart?    1CO 14: 24 But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying,........25 and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"    Yes!  Unfortunately, many good intentioned Christians skip acknowledging this gift because of fear I think.  Christians, please do not tear out and discard this valueable part of God's word!      Bible believing Christians cannot ignore that we are to earnestly desire spiritual gifts, and especially earnestly desire to prophesy!    1CO 14:1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. 2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. 3 But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. 4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.    At the same time, don't just accept any prophesy, but test the spirits.      1CO 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said......    1JN 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.    God has also gifted me with a measure of this gift.  I have desired it earnestly and am striving to have the gift developed to it's fullest measure!    God is awesome and he is the giver of good gifts to those who long for them!  Didn't you feel blessed when she gave you that word?     Bri ; )|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I don't know what to tell you.

Those who are humbled during the great tribulation and repent and receive God's favor to live into the millenium. The 144,000 are truly blessed in that they are IN the Kingdom of God as first fruits. To even live into the Millenium reign is in itself is a blessing. But flesh is flesh and still deals with the nature of fallen man. Though it will be much easier without Satan.

(Acts 24:15) By their faithfulness to God, obedient mankind will be granted what our original parents losteverlasting life in human perfection on a paradise earth.Revelation 21:3, 4.    In the Bible book of Isaiah, we get a preview of what life will be like in the Paradise earth. No inhabitant of Paradise will say, "I am sick." (Isaiah 33:24) Animals will pose no danger to man. (Isaiah 11:6-9) People will build beautiful homes and inhabit them and will plant crops and eat to satisfaction. (Isaiah 65:21-25) Moreover, God "will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces."Isaiah 25:8.    Soon, obedient mankind will live under such blessed conditions. They "will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God." (Romans 8:21) How wonderful it will be to live forever in the promised earthly Paradise! (Luke 23:43) You can be there if you act upon accurate knowledge of the Scriptures and exercise faith in Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

These ones are having to learn the truth and how to worship God in the manner He desired and to conform their lives . . . this will take time. During that time, some thinking will be incorrect and need adjustment.    During that time also, the earth will be brought ever closer to perfection, the place & the people. At the end, all will be exactly like it was in the Garden Of Eden when Adam & Eve lived . . . THEN, Jesus will turn it all over to His Father. As perfect beings, those living will be, like Adam, able to consult directly with God.     Now, as a final test, Satan will be released . . . those who follow him as Adam did will be destroyed as Adam was. All else will go on living in Paradise for ever as perfect beings having a close personal relationship with God (beautiful).    REMEMBER . . . our purpose in life is the Sanctification Of God's Name and His Soverienty confirming Satan the liar that he is!|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Frankly, the dude sounds like a bit of a jerk.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Well to start with you are taking several verses in the bible out of context and trying to connect them together at a point in time that was not implied.    At the point Jesus physically returns to earth there is no complete judgment.     Only the Anti-Christ and those who have worshiped him are removed from earth. Those who were beheaded for refusing to worship the Anti-Christ are raised.    Those are the only two groups dealt with directly at his physical return.    By inference we know that if a person had gone through the entire tribulation and had not taken the mark and worshiped the Anti-Christ they are left on the earth and enter the millenium. Worship of Christ is not required.    We also know that belief and acceptance of Christ is not require because people have the choice of coming to Jerusalem once a year to offer to Christ an offering. If they fail to do it then they will receive no rain. If they had no choice then this would not be an issue.     One other thing. At the end of the 1000 years Satan is loosed and in a "season"; a season is about three months. During this time he manages to raise an army without number to go against God. So if they have not choice but to worship God then how could Satan succeed?    Where the every knee will bow and every tongue confess comes into play is in the final judgment at the end of the millenium. There all those who have rejected God will have to admit that he is God and bow before him.|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	I'm aiming higher.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	Why are you expecting logic and consistency from mythology?|`|gEOVHZcVaa	mostly because we dont like serving fairy tales, have a good day.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	they will bow at the final judgment and say and confess that jesus christ is lord not during the 1000 year reign.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Your point is well made.  It stands to reason that one meaning of a word is meant to be understood the same way when used in the same context, as previously used.    When a sculptor, say Michelangelo, made a work of art, one could say that the figure was in the "likeness" of the model.  To me, this scripture indicates that man was made in the image and likeness of God.   This certainly would imply then, that God had a body of flesh and bones, and we appear in his likeness.      Other instances of the Bible using words that are meant to have the same meaning is when we are instructed to become "one" with our spouses.   We certainly are not meant to fuse two bodies together and literally become one being.   We are to become "one in purpose" with our husbands or wives.     See Matthew 19:5    5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?     Know where this is leading.....?   God and Christ are also "one in purpose," not being a multi personalitied body of two people.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	It is not like D&C 130:22 says, "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also;..."    This contradicts with the Bible.    1. God is invisible:  Colossians 1:15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:    2. God is a spirit.  John 4:24  God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.    3. A spirit does not have flesh and bones.  Luke 24:39  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.    Jesus was God before he had a body. (John 1:1, 14)    So, what does Gen 5:3 mean? It's talking about our soul. It means we were originally created in glory, righteousness and holiness, which is like God and we can be like again if we accept Christ:    Ephesians 4:24  And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.    2 Corinthians 3:18  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.    Colossians 3:10  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:    P.S. Regarding Genesis 32:30. When we look at Jesus, we can see that the God of the universe has a lot of power and can take on the form of a man. This is not His glorious state, however. If it was, Jacob would have been dead.|`|pFlkWQySaa	Take out of it what you want.

We are created in God's image.  We have a physical body like the Son we are made of our soul or Spirit just like the Father and the Spirit.

The Bible says in 1 Cor. 15:45  "And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.       1 Cor. 15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.     1Co 15:47  The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.

As far as God having a body, it could be entirely possible, since it states that he made woman and man in his image, meaning how he looks.|`|IebqhGoNaa	i think it does mean the same but instead of asking on the internet ask a pastor he/she should know and god is in the spirit not in the flesh so he does have a body in the spirit but you won't see him until you get to heaven|`|AA10523413	Hi,    I will try to answer your question.    1) Gen 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.    In the original Hebrew, the word "image" is Tselem" meaning : shade, resemblance, or bodily outward form.    Also the word "likeness" in Hebrew is "Demuwth" meaning also : resemblance, model or bodily shape.    So yes, God does have a body and we are modeled after His image and both verses mean the same thing.    Similar evidence is found in Gen 18:1-33. This is the account of God visiting Abraham in the Plains of Mamre. God and two angels in bodily form visited Abraham. This may go on to show that God is capable of moving from place to place just like any ordinary man. It also shows that they ate in verse 8, rose up in vs 16, and Abraham even went with them to bring them on their way.    Others: The Book of Psalms is chock full of more detailed descriptions. However, I do remember somewhere where The Bible says that "He protects us by the feathers of his wings". Some words are poetic and figurative, so that don't mean God's a great big chicken :)|`|UTak66q0aa	The Bible says that God made man in his own image and likeness. At a primitive level, this means that human beings "look like" God. However, God is not a physical being, so it means that the human souls created by God have a nature similar to his (but not as perfect). The author says that whether or not what the Bible says is true (that God made human beings to be similar to Him), it is clear that when human beings make up gods, the ones they imagine are similar to humans.    "His" is spelled with a capital letter, because it's traditional in English and other European languages to begin all pronouns referring to God with capital letters, so you get He, His, You, etc.    The Good Book says that God made Man in His own image.    Wrong. It's the other way round.    Oh, one more thing. The murals were predominantly done by Catholic nations, or Catholic communities in non-Catholic states.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Yes. Jesus.   Revelation speaks of God and his tabernacle.    God had to have a body to be seen.|`|AA11622701	He did when he came in the form of Jesus in the Incarnation.      But both scriptures refer not to a "physical" likeness but instead to a spiritual likeness.  Adam shared the spiritual image of God, in that he is able to understand spiritual things, morality, make moral decisions, and commune with God.      Seth shared his father Adam's image, which at the time was a "fallen" spirit, marred by sin.  That is why the Bible states Seth was the image of Adam, not the image of God.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	God may, or may not, have a "body"... it does not matter to man...

And your body is made up of the same God like material.     And that is why the original gospel is telling us to become "Children of the Light." Since the Light of God is needed to see (wake up to) who we really are. Click on my avatar if you want a further explanation.

To me he just seems like any old deceiver not someone exalting himself above God. Not to mention "the falling away" happened some 14 years ago didn't it? Wouldn't that mean that Yeshua should have come already? And shouldn't Tkach still be alive since thats how he's thrown into the lake of fire? You should dig deeper into this religion of yours, its not biblical, or rather its twisted biblical.     You see Armstrong had a lot of good truth but the one thing that brought in bad ideas from individuals was his "belief" that everyone was to tithe. Only those in the land of Israel according to the word are supposed to tithe 10% and no one outside of that LAND is supposed to.  That seems to be where your church started to go wrong. Like the modern christian churches money has really perverted some people, even your church leaders.  Tkach was simply a man who had ideas that were not unlike the modern christian and confused those in your church that were susceptible to anyones theories of the word. His being "the apostasy, the antichrist, the son of perdition" do NOT line up with the word of God unless you twist it like so many religions do.  God's "true" church as you call it is not the WWCG its anyone who follow's YHWH's covenant, loves him and believes in his son Yeshua the messiah. The beliefs of the world wide church of god are twisted versions of the truth. You see the wwcg, seventh day adventists, mormons, JW's, and british israelism all have pieces of the truth but continue to add or take away from the word of God.

He also taught us to hate sin and said he came to cause division, even among family members.  It is quite difficult to love if the people around us are not loving.  A good question to ask are we loving?  Much of TV promotes sex, not love which involves commitment.    2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.    the Cathechism of the Catholic Church    http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__...    So if people are not loving, perhaps they are sinning.  This is good to reflect upon to see where we are guilty.    What the media has been doing lately is accusing Churches of hating.  This is false, we are called to love.  The media is playing people and really practicing hate themselves by lying about doing this.  The Catholic Church helps more people with Aids then any other organization.  And there is over a 10% failure rate of condoms that the media doesn't like to talk about.  In my opinion, not giving both sides is hate.

Although not supported by the research, many therapists believe that homosexuality is solely biological in nature, and therefore unchangeable. Yet despite ongoing efforts, researchers have not discovered a biological basis for same-sex attractions. In fact, many researchers hypothesize that a homosexual orientation stems from a combination of biological and environmental factors.     http://www.narth.com/docs/hom101.html      Can You Change Your Sexual Orientation?

People in general do not know God's righteous standards and they all alienated from God's love.  God does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires everyone to repent and continue living.  Anyone can change his life (way of living) to fit God's way once he learns what God requires of him.    "Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance." --2 Peter 3:9.    God's requirements are not hard to do.  We don't push or condemn people.  We encourage them to take in the knowledge of God and let them make change in themselves to fit God's way.  People do not born gay, they got their mind to thinking this way because of the influenced by the society and by our imperfect mind of reasoning.  No matter how bad we are, if we want to, we can make to change once we acquire the knowledge of God and what we must do to be loved by God.     "For this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome." --1 John 5:3.    One thing for sure, God does not accept gay life styles.  Gay people can change once they come to accurate knowledge of God.  God is pure and perfect, He does not bend His perfect ways to fit our imperfect life.

I know those who swore they were born gay... & have since said that is a lie... their gay friends (which yes, they still have gay friends, & so do I)  but their gay friends get so angry with them, when they tell them it is a lie... but that is what it is...    Those who are no longer gay... WERE as gay as they come... even the same way despising those who told them these things...    A baby is not even born with any sexual desires... a person can be attracted to sheep & claim they were born that way... but this would not be true... & cow could claim they were born attracted to horses... (if they could speak) but this is not true.    A pedophile could claim they were born that way, but this is not true.    & a yank could claim they were born that way (& prefer it solo)... it isn't true.    A person isn't born one way or another with sexual desires... they have their preferences because at some point they chose that... it's a learned behavior.    I know straight guys who have not yet been happy with a woman they have been with, & they are in their middle ages... yet, they are not gay... they have strong physical attractions to females... just relationally they have problems.    Those who claim it's a birth thing, don't understand the psychology of it... they question & challenge the cultural & godly mores... & a young developing person can be influenced to be attracted to different variations by their environment & surroundings & thought processes, which can be recreated.    If you could do different experiments to prove this, it could be proved... (I'm not going to suggest anyone do these... just saying it is possible)  If you took a child & caused them to grow up around their same sex, never having seen or heard of an opposite sex, they would end up wanting to be sexual with those of the same sex... & we see the same thing in animal behavior.    When people are given the choice of both sexes (by growing up around both) then there is a choice made which can be influenced by any number of different factors... (which we also see in the animal kingdom)  Because most do not choose to challenge the cultural norms & mores, they mostly choose the opposite sex,... which they understanding as being how it's supposed to be... (which we even see in the animal kingdom)   Because humans have all sorts of ideologies they often have more reasons & choice factors to make odd choices in an affluent society...  than most of the animal kingdom.      Conclusion, they subconsciously choose the same sex, for reasons unknown to them... at an early age.  Then believing it was something they were born with.  they don't want to change, aren't willing to change, don't think it'd be pleasurable, but consider it to be repulsive to them.    There are those spending life in prison, who have cell mates, who have become gay...   & There are those who I have seen at an early age, who were confused about which sex they should be attracted to.  & there are those who've made porn who were repulsed by the same sex at first who had since learned to be bisexual... as revealed in interviews... these are learned behaviors even this truth is rejected & those who're a certain way do not fully understand or accept this.   Or even if in modern society these truths are disputed (we know the push & pull of special interests groups who're united with other special interest groups influence both politics & other funded groups in these days in which alliances are formed for the purpose of increasing the varied groups political influential strengths & pulls)... yet, all these things don't change the truths, only create confusion of them in the interest of those who desire the confusion.  People believe what they want to believe & challenge, that their beliefs are right based on their feelings & emotions, rather than based on facts.    I understand that it would be repulsive to them to be with the opposite sex & or would simply not pleasure them or turn them on. & I also would agree that it would be a difficult if not impossible thing for an adult to change their sexual preference. I wouldn't claim to begin to know how to do this. Or how to tell someone else to do this... & I'm sure many have tried & have failed... So I do not dispute those things in the least.

When Alcohol was made illegal in the first part of the twentieth century, rates of alcoholism skyrocketed, and control of the distribution of alcohol fell to criminal organizations, which blossomed into full blown mobs.  By funding clinics that NOT ONLY perform abortions but also distribute information about birth control, you can actually expect abortion rates to drop in the near future.

If we make abortion illegal, we will have young women hacking up their bodies with coat hangers and butchers.

No Christian in his right mind should have even thought about voting for Barack Obama. Not that McCain would've been any better.The only logical choice for an American president would have been to write in Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party. That's what I did. We need "real" leadership in America. Legislation with Teeth.    We Christians have continuously been duped into voting for "pro life" candidates who seem to forget their pro-life stance once they get in power. I ask you fellow Christians this: What difference does it make if your candidate is pro-life if he doesn't do a damn thing about it (pardon my French) once he gets in office? Not one abortion has been prevented since 1973 by voting for a Republican or a Democrat, and we've elected hundreds of candidates, "pro life" candidates, who have done absolutely nothing to end abortion, other than to give a statement to the media every time they come up for re-election that they "feel that abortion is wrong". Who cares???  DO SOMETHING TO STOP IT !!  Christians need some real leadership, someone who has the guts to tell a particular candidate who's running on a pro-life platform, "You have ONE term to do something. Make it happen, or you will not have earned our votes in the future. Do what you say you will do and end this murder pronto. Either make it happen, or get out of the way and we'll elect someone who will".        This "lesser of two evils" crap is not cutting it anymore. I quit drinking the Kool Aid years ago. I urge you Christians to do likewise.

bxxwhP04aa	The Book of Isaiah is classified as one of the Major Prophets.  He prophesied many things.  The passages you refer to, and reading on to the end of that chapter, God will visit with indignation the enemies of Israel, including Assyria, their present foe.  (See Zech. 12:1-9).  Verse 33, Tophet, is a place in the Valley of Hinnom where sacrifices, including children, were offered to the false god, Molech.  It suggests a funeral pyre and symbolizes that the foreign king would be dead by God's breath of judgment.

And no one, not even a good Christian, is perfect.  Some people who get really caught up in their religion (and I don't mean only Christians here) get really self-righteous and egotistical and start to look down on others who aren't as "enlightened" as themselves.  This might be why some Christians (and Jews, and Muslims, etc) come across as not-so-loving towards others who they perceive as not as "good" as themselves.
uFyycbjiaa	I honestly think Christianities interpretations have made it the debacle it is today.    From what I know, it's based of one of the questions he gets asked, [i'm paraphrasing of course]    They asked him, what the greatest commandment was, and he replies, love the L-rd your G-d with all your heart, mind and soul. Then he continues to say, and the 2nd is almost as great, "love your neighbor as yourself".  Those seem to be his famous words and from here, people say that he not only negated the 613 in the Torah, but also, the 10 commandments spoken of in Sinai.    It seems to me, if they would've asked him, what are the 20 greatest, he would've given 21.   If they would've asked, what are the 612 greatest commandments, he would've gone through 613.   That's my opinion.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	All the old laws still apply (according to Jesus)    http://www.evilbible.com/do_not_ignore_o...|`|KWwW7N49aa	Jesus never voided the 10 commandments but simply stated that no man can keep them but Him because during his lifetime he fulfilled the Law and never broke one.  Therefore, if you believe on Jesus as your Savior with His righteousness imputed onto you by faith, you can be holy and righteous before Father God.  Jesus summed up the whole Law as this:  Love your neighbor like you love yourself and love God with all your heart, soul and body.  Doing these two cover all of the Law.

I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.  For assuredly I say to you, 'til heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law until it is fulfilled."   If you have a Bible you ought to read the verses following these two verses.  Jesus did not come to do away with the law, but He came to live out the law in its fullest.  He did live out the law, He did not sin in any area of the law (commandments).  He did this for us, as none of us are able to do this for ourselves.    I hope this helps.|`|mfSp38yzaa	They aren't void. Jesus said we should love God with all our heart, and love our neighbor as ourselves.

He said, "I came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it".  The confusion was, over 600 man-made laws had been passed during the Old Testament days that were not in keeping with the heart of God relating to the commandments. Such as the keeping of the Sabbath. Jesus was criticized for not keeping the Sabbath commandment. But Jesus went on to explain that the Pharisees (religious leaders) had it all wrong. Jesus explained that "the sabbath was made for man- not man for the sabbath".  So he got the compass pointed back in the right direction.    Jesus was asked by Pontius Pilate (governor of Juea, who had Jesus in custody before His crucifixion) why He came to earth, and Jesus responded "I came to testify to the Truth". To which Pilate responded, "what is truth?"      Think about that.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	That is why we still keep the Sabbath as God instucts.

That is why true Christian's today don't follow the Jewish customs and practices , such as feasts , tabernacling , fasting's , tithing etc.    Those that say that these things are important should carefully read the scriptures ,, they will find that first century Christians did NOT continue with these old ways.    The mosaic system was ended as far as Christians were concerned.    Likewise , true Christians today do not participate in Jewish or mosaic covenant customs and practices.

The blood and flesh of Christ replaced those sacrifices . . . so, now it is faith in the blood and flesh of Christ, a new sacrifice, THAT  saves.     He said that he came to  replace the 'LAW' as the commandment(s) were called, belief in Him is the ONLY means to salvation as men are still imperfect and unable to observe the old Hebrew 'law'.|`|CcHUacLPaa	Since Jesus sacrificed his life on Earth to redeem us, we no longer need to do sacrifices to God as instructed by Mosaic law. But we do need to adhere to the hundreds of rules and regs in the Old Testament including the 10 commandments. If you plan on using only half of God's laws you may as well be a non believer. Those who claim the laws of the Old Testament are null and void are ignorant of God's Word. The Islamics and the Hebrews use the Word of God, the same Word of God we use. If anyone tells you those sacred pronouncements of God are no longer valid then that is a work of the Devil.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	Jesus didn't do away with the ten commandments.  In fact, if you want to say that He changed them in any way, He made them more strict.    On adultery - Don't even look at a woman with lust.    On murder - Don't even speak to a brother with hate.    GAWDZ - It is the CONDEMNATION of the law that we are no longer under.  He completed the law - it says that a penalty MUST be paid and He paid it.  That frees us from the PENALTY, not the law.

Question: "Why is God so different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament?"    Answer: At the very heart of this question lies a fundamental misunderstanding of what both the Old and New Testaments reveal about the nature of God. Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love. The fact that the Bible is Gods progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to peoples misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament. However, when one reads both the Old and the New Testaments it becomes evident that God is not different from one Testament to another and that Gods wrath and His love are revealed in both Testaments.    For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5; Psalm 86:15; Psalm 108:4; Psalm 145:8; Joel 2:13). Yet in the New Testament, Gods loving-kindness and mercy are manifested even more fully through the fact that God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16). Throughout the Old Testament, we also see God dealing with Israel much the same way a loving father deals with a child. When they willfully sinned against Him and began to worship idols, God would chastise them, yet each and every time He would deliver them once they had repented of their idolatry. This is much the same way that we see God dealing with Christians in the New Testament. For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.    In a similar way, throughout the Old Testament we see Gods judgment and wrath poured out on unrepentant sinners. Likewise, in the New Testament, we see that the wrath of God is still being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness (Romans 1:18). Even with just a quick reading of the New Testament, it is evident that Jesus talks more about hell than He does about heaven. So, clearly, God is no different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament. God by His very nature is immutable (unchanging). While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, He Himself does not change.    When one really begins to read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old Testament and the New Testament. Even though the Bible is really sixty-six individual books, written on two (or possibly three) continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years by more than 40 authors (who came from many walks of life), it remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction. In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations. Truly, the Bible is Gods love letter to mankind. Gods love for His creation, especially for mankind, is evident all through Scripture. Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth. Yet we also see a holy and righteous God who is the Judge of all those who disobey His word and refuse to worship Him, instead turning to worship gods of their own creation, worshiping idols and other gods instead of worshiping the one and only true God (Romans 1).    Because of Gods righteous and holy character, all sinpast, present, and futuremust be judged. Yet God in His infinite love has provided a payment for sin and a way of reconciliation so that sinful man can escape His wrath. We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin, but this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a real substitutionary atonement for sin. The Savior that was promised in the Old Testament is more fully revealed in the New Testament, and the ultimate expression of Gods love, the sending of His son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory. Both the Old and the New Testaments were given "to make us wise unto salvation" (2 Timothy 3:15). When we study them more closely, it really is evident that God is no different in the New Testament than He was in the Old Testament.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because God cannot change.|`|e57c7db914fb45d19d9afc6f475d8c37aa	Wait until the God of the New Testament (Jesus) comes back..

When he went to pay them, the man who had worked all day said, "why are you paying those who worked only an hour the same wage?  I worked for you all day"!  The owner of the field replied, "didn't I give you your contracted wage?  It is up to me to decide who gets what, isn't it?"    God extends the same mercy to those who have served him all their lives, and those who just come to faith in him in the last breath.  This is the mercy of God.

"He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. 6About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'     7" 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.        "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'     8"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'     9"The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. 10So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12'These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'     13"But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? 14Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money?

You could be killed crossing the street and you wouldn't have enough time to repent. Plus, Jesus is coming again and no one knows when, so He could come, and you wouldn't have enough time.  Secondly, being "good" won't save you. It is only by faith and trust in the Lord Jesus that anyone can be saved. (Ephesians 2:9 For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works lest any man should boast.) And repentance takes God's work. No one can make a complete 180 degree turn around by themselves, they just don't have the strength or will power. Sorry, that's a really bad explanation, but if you want to know more, I would suggest you get yourself a Bible and start reading in John.     God bless!!!

The Quarters are Yule and Litha (Winter and Summer solstice) and Mabon and Ostara (Equinoxes).<br>  <br>  The particular myths associated with the Sabbats varies from tradition to tradition.  In my particular tradition of Wicca, Ostara is the time when the new God quickens within the womb of the Goddess, analogous to the fast approaching Spring.

Bunnies and eggs and soft pastel colors...rabbit stew and egg dishes are traditional, and when we decorate eggs we talk about our hopes for the coming year.  The Goddess as Maiden is an important theme, as well as the young trickster God, and we try to reflect those themes in our circle.

The meaning of life constitutes a philosophical question concerning the purpose and significance of human existence. The concept can be expressed through a variety of related questions, such as Why are we here?, What's life all about? and What is the meaning of it all?. It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific, and theological speculation throughout history and there have been a large number of answers from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.    The meaning of life is deeply mixed with the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, consciousness, and happiness, and touches on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, conceptions of God, the existence of God, the soul and the afterlife. Scientific contributions are more indirect; by describing the empirical facts about the universe, science provides some context and sets parameters for conversations on related topics. An alternative, human-centric, and not a cosmic/religious approach is the question "What is the meaning of my life?" The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may be considered to be coincidal with the achievement of ultimate reality, if that is believed by one to exist.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Life begins in the beginning.      This is what Wikipedia has to say about life http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life|`|FL67UPPHaa	Ok, I'm looking at this from a biological viewpoint rather than a philosophical one!    The standard biological definition of life:  1. All living things are highly organized.  2. All living things have an ability to acquire materials and energy.  3. All living things have an ability to respond to their environment.  4. All living things have an ability to reproduce.  5. All living things have an ability to adapt.    These characteristics are present in the zygote even before implantation, and so life begins at conception.    The sperm and the egg join, and the resulting zygote has a full set of original human DNA. It isn't a part of the mother's body because the sets of DNA belonging to the mother and the zygote are different. Genetically, a new human has been created. Gestation is the first stage of life.|`|pYrooh0Haa	Here's the conventional scientific definition:    All life requires:    1. Homeostasis  2. Organization  3. Metabolism  4. Growth  5. Adaptation  6. Response to stimuli  7. Reproduction    When does life begin? That's a trickier question without any one clear answer.

8IHfytEvaa	I was a bit younger, so I suppose I had not done a whole boat load of sinning the way some had, so my salvation was not quite that dramatic, but it changed my life.    For me it happened 43 years ago next month.    I still remember the location, the preacher, the chalk drawing that he did while he was preaching.    I still look back on that day and know that that was the day I became a Christian.    I didn't understand it very well then, but I knew from that moment that something very significant had changed in my life and my life has not been the same since.    As I grew older, as I began to understand things better, I knew that that was the day when I was born again.    There are somethings I will never forget.    What I was doing when I heard that President Kennedy has been shot.    The first time I looked over the rim into the Grand Canyon.    The first time I . . . .  with my bride.    The birth of my children.    The sick feeling the first time my bride called 911 and falsely accused me of abuse.    I was just as sick when years later her divorce was final, even tho I had won sole custody of our children.  And I'll never forget that day.    I'll never forget the wedding of my children.  I'll probably remember that more than my own.    I'll never forget the day when my shingle finally came in the mail signifying that I had graduated from college.    I'll never forget the day I came home from the Vietnam War.    And I'll never forget the day that Jesus became my friend, 43 years ago, next month.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	How wonderful, really, how wonderful!    I am saved but it didn't happen all at once like that *smile*.  I can't point to a particular moment.    But I'm so happy for you.|`|Iva8drdfaa	Well, that was a beautiful picture.      I can only imagine.|`|RMMdGYCDaa	Your experience is very heartfelt and I know many who have came to Christ that way.  For me, it was different, God opened my eyes, wide open, then my heart.  I thought probably there was a god but he was not sovereign and the Bible was a lot of good stories.  God showed me He was real through the Holy Spirit, more than anything.  I accepted Jesus Christ and lots of the "old" me passed away and I was made new.  I'm still a work in progress but I know He is real.  I feel bad for those who are so sure that He is not.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Yes, it happen at an instant for me too. God is gracious!|`|XFnHshOMaa	Yeah I know that happens and I am glad for you. God has taken the pain from my heart. It's a slow sometimes, but it's all going away. I'll keep praying for you.|`|5e0c2b6e245998c415bb4509ecae5500aa	Nope, haven't had it.  I've had strong feelings like that, but I never interpreted it as meaning I was saved, just that I know he exists.|`|3ZzlrChgaa	Yes, many.|`|Cmk1VPY2aa	Nope, I sure haven't|`|xsZB4XDFaa	I believe God "knocks on the door" of all people.  He doesn't force Himself on anyone.  He wants you to love Him for being Him.    I too had such a positive experience when I finally asked Jesus into my heart.  It was like I was seeing CLEARLY for the first time in my life.  I was embarrassed and ashamed for many things that I had done in the past.      People think that they are not going to HAVE FUN if they become a Christian.  They couldn't be FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!!  I am happy just to be IN HIM and listen to Him every day!!    He IS REAL, but He only shows Himself to those that put their trust in Him.  If people want to truly experience God, they need to put their trust in HIM!!|`|AA11367986	This feeling can only be understood by those who have felt it.  To the unbelievers, it is the stuff of nonsense, but to the believer, it is the essence of new birth.  It is impossible to explain the experience to those who have not had it, but it is hard to forget for those who have received it.|`|AnCC6pBXaa	My experience was not like that.  I just knew from an early age that God was real and I never questioned it.|`|OfeCeEvqaa	I only wish that I had a similar experience. As a nominal Christian I was in and out of church many times, I was in a backslidden condition and had walked away from God. Many times I tried to live my life my way and always came to the conclusion that it was pointless to even try. In spite of the fact that I had attempted suicide many times it just wasn't my time to die, praise the Lord. It seemed that no matter how much I tried to live my life without God, there was always a tug on my heart from Him to return. I had my epiphany two years ago and finally  yielded my life and my soul to Him. It has never been the same since that time. It is only through Him that I'm alive today, have a purpose for living and a ministry to fulfill. My life is full and more meaningful than it has been for years. In spite of the fac hat I have lost two homes in two ears the Lord has always been with me and guided my steps all the way. I have a peace that surpasses all understanding and I know the Lord is mine and I am His. After many years of wandering without God I can honestly declare that I HAVE RETURNED !!!    I have returned to the God of my childhood,  To the same simple faith as a child I once knew;  Like the prodigal son I have longed for my loved ones,  For the comforts of home and the God I outgrew.  I have returned to the God of my childhood,  Bethlehem's Babe, the prophet's Messiah;  He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;  Praise His name, I have returned.    I have returned to the God of my mother,  With unfailing faith for the child of her heart;  She said bring them up the way that you want them,  Thank God when they're grown, they'll never depart.  I have returned to the God of my mother,  I learned at her knee He's the lily of the valley;  He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;  Praise His name, I have returned.    I have returned to the God of my father,  The most God-like man a child could know;  I just heard a shout from the angels in glory,  Praising the Lord a child has come home.  I have returned to the God of my father,  Creator of heaven and earth, God of the universe;  He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;  Praise His name, I have returned.    I have returned to the Yahweh of Judah,  On my knees I did fall where the wall now stands;  This lesson I learned as I've worked my way homeward,  The Saviour of all is a comfort to man.  I have returned to the Father of Abraham,  The shepherd of Moses who called Him the great I Am;  He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;  Praise His name, I have returned.    In Christ, gatita_63109

To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory for ever and ever. Jesus Christ is Lord.    Desert Rose,     Yes, the One sitting on the throne is the Father: God, but didn't you notice the whole creation is worshiping both the Father and the Son? That means both the Son and the Father are on the same level and there's nobody above them; they're both above the whole creation and the Father shares His glory with the Son. Have you read in the bible the Father doesn't share His glory with anybody? Here in this passage (Revelation 5:13) He does share His glory with the Son. Why? Because the Father and the Son are both the same God.     Read John 1:1 -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." -- The Word is our Lord Jesus Christ and here we can see the Word is God.    Also read Zechariah 14:9 -- "And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one." -- Here we can see the Lord will be one God (in the end) and His name will be one name; the Son and the Father will become one.     Also, why do you think the jews wanted to stone our Lord Jesus Christ when He was here on earth? Because they understood His claim to be the "Son of God" as something that made Him equal to God. The jews thought our Lord was teaching people that He was God and that (to them) was blasphemy. That's why they wanted to stone Him.    I don't think you'll be able to understand this, but at least I tried to help you see it.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Yes ...and no....    you can Marry with a witness....but we are not a  date agency ....that is a human process......rgiht now the most important thing is your son...and his future    anttttonio Sin ofensas Who is the one who o sits on the throne?? is not Jesus cause he is the lamb....Who is him?? his name??

xxEhpytpaa	The reason there is no scientific info on the soul is because they cannot see it, therefore no soul. But have you ever been present when someone has passed. Well I have and you can see the soul leaving the body when it happens. I witnessed it when my grandmother died and I was holding her, and again when my mother-in-law passed. You really couldn't see it but you could feel the energy as it happened. And I know that they were still there in the room. Something very spiritual happened at that moment. And lingered for a while.  Not even the devil himself knows how the soul is infused in the body, but he knows it is there, for he waits and tries to snatch it up.  Only God knows and that's the reason no scientist have never tried to find out about it. For they cannot see it. God bless you.|`|0lzVoLW9aa	Yes !!!!!! Let me get out my SOUL-A-METER...

What scientific tools do you recommend using to study your theory?|`|176PIYNVaa	There are scientific-based theories of "soul" or consciousness out there. In a gist, consciousness is the sum of symbolic interpretations of chemical state of the brain, the state of neurons, neuroconnections, hormones, etc. Much like an interpretation of software running on computer hardware.    No, there is no separate entity or energy. There is no "soul" as a supernatural entity. And, when your brain dies, your consciousness is gone forever.|`|LGagW0Tsaa	You can't have it both ways here Denis.    You want scientists to investigate the soul or spirit to establish whether or not it exists.    Yet you already seem to believe that it does.    You want Dawkins to investigate without prejudice, yet your mind is already made up without any objective scientific evidence.    If he did investigate the existence of the soul/spirit, such as you believe it to be, but could not find any evidence, would you accept that finding? At least as a strong indicator that your belief was misplaced?    Evolution is accepted because there is overwhelming evidence that it happens. All that Richard Dawkins wants, if I might presume to speak for him, is sound evidence for the existence of any god. He is prepared to go with the evidence, are you?
wnsFO3GCaa	Quite a few crazy things happened in my school. Like Autumn Leaves we had our fair share of bomb threats. My school was in a sensitive part of the world so they were always taken seriously but we were never sent home. We were made to line up just outside the school walls in 110+ degree heat for hours on end, it was torture. If there was a bomb we would be killed anyway because the sports hall would have collapsed on us all.<br>  <br>  We had an idiot sniff chloroform in our D&T class and almost killed himself. He passed out and was foaming at the mouth, scary stuff. Some guy chucked a breeze block through the sports hall window. Someone set fire to a violin in the music block. For a good school we had some real idiots in it.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	There wasn't junior highschool, when I was in that age group. But in<br>  7th grade, our teacher, a jovial, robust kind of guy, was reported by<br>  several girls for his being a bit too familiar with them, when he would<br>  pull us down on his lap, and joke around with us. He was more like a<br>  father figure to me and my best friend. And we were too naive to know<br>  what he may have had on  his mind. Girls were sheltered back then,<br>  and some things remained mysteries until we learned about them <br>  from other kids in school. <br>      Our teacher was called into the teachers' lunch room and those<br>  girls he'd befriended were seated, waiting for him to appear. The<br>  principal told him what he'd been accused of doing, and admonished<br>  him before all of us, who'd signed the complaint. He was told, he<br>  would never work in that state, or any other as a class room teacher<br>  again. His face was beet red, and he was very embarrassed. He<br>  was ushered back to the principals office after that, and was never<br>  seen again at our school.<br>    In 8th grade, a girl I disliked intensely due to her snobby attitude<br>  liked the same boy I did. She didn't hide the fact,which embarrassed<br>  the boy, whenever she'd be around him. I don't know why, but fhe<br>  suspected that I liked him too. And she told him outright, that I did.<br>  And I was within ear shot. His face shot beet red, seeing me, and our<br>  eyes locked. I had thought for some time, he also liked me, and we<br>  looked at each other often in class. She seemed to know that he and<br>  I had a mutual admiration going on, and made her conversation loud<br>  enough for me to hear. So I joined in and faced the music. Denying of<br>  course, that he and I barely knew the other existed. He nodded as<br>  much, and the girl, brought her accusation to an end, without the<br>  fanfare she'd expected to have. It sure did my heart good to be able to<br>  diffuse that situation. She thought she'd be making a fool out of me,<br>  and she was left holding the bag, so to speak. After that, whenever<br>  we'd see each other, we looked the other way. Including during our<br>  years in HS together. And I never heard of her ever having a boyfriend,<br>  just occasional dance dates, so she wouldn't have to go alone. Her<br>  family was well to do, and she thought she was someone special, or<br>  at least, acted like that. So I occasionally wonder, what happened<br>  to her after highschool came to an end.|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	There was no junior high when I was in school.  There was K-7 and 8-12.

I sat there one day watching the teacher do problems on the blackboard. I was really engrossed, concentrating and then the students sitting behind me started snickering and murmuring. The teacher turned around to see what the matter was. He looked around the classroom and his eyes finally settled on me. “WESLEY! What are you doing?”<br>  <br>  I was in shock. “Nothing”, I replied<br>  <br>  The teacher stood directly over me peering over his glasses saying, “Yes you are. You’re wiggling your ears.

Back then in the Brady Bunch era, 40 year old women didn't have babies and divorce was not common and this was in California!  We had to move back to the Midwest and live with my grandparents who were very conservative and really didn't get me.    It was pretty outrageous to me.<br>  <br>  Also, there was a strong earthquake one morning when I was in eighth grade, I went to school and found out that only half of the students showed up.  We pretty much had a play day because of all the missing people, and having to get under our desks when the aftershocks hit.  It was really pretty fun.

We have lived here for more than 45 years, and so, we have known lots of people, seen lots of changes, and there have been lots of events that needed to be recorded and preserved.

AA11056188	There is no more prophesy today! The Bible has ended all prophesy because we don't receive revelations any more. If we were to continue receiving revelations that that would mean that the Word of God wasn't complete. Concerning tongues, we are told that where there are tongues, they shall cease and that happened well over a thousand years ago. Those who claim to have the gift today simply don't. One needs to carefully evaluate what they see in light of what the Scriptures tell us.The Gift of tongues was given for no other reason but to preach the gospel to unbelieving Jews therefore, it was a known language and not some ecstatic gibberish which is unknown to be any language on earth. The so-called modern "tongues speakers" don't line up with Scripture so they should be avoided as whatever is speaking through them is not of the Lord as they claim. These people will tell you that it is important that you speak in tongues because it evidences your salvation. Not so says the Bible, "tongues are a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not" and the "them" are in fact the Jews. It is to be remembered that satan is a great imitator of the Lord and he uses this type of thing to deceive people. During the tribulation, Satan will give power to a statue and cause it to speak so the people will hail him as God because of the "lying signs and wonders" he will perform. We are told not to believe everything which appears to be a miracle because satan can work them also..|`|AA10725805	I believe that they are still coming.

zPfgFXU5aa	It wouldn't matter to Christianity as a whole, but it would be a disaster for the Roman Catholic church because all they have is some thirdparty hearsay evidence that the Apostle Peter was the bishop at Rome, and there is no evidence in the New Testament that there was anything special about the congregation at Rome, but the popes who rule in Rome, claim that Peter was the first bishop at Rome, and claim that it is therefore the mother church.       Even if Peter did regularly visit Rome and preach there, and even if he died and was buried there, that does not mean he was the Bishop there.    In fact, the biblical evidence that Peter was not the pastor or bishop at Rome is overwhelming. Paul wrote TO the church at Rome in A.D. 58, but though he mentions 27 people by name, he does not mention Peter. That would have been an inexcusable affront if Peter had been the pope at Rome, but quite understandable if Rome was just one of many places that Peter evangalised in.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	He could be buried under my house in Dallas, it wouldn't matter.|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	It would take some of the zing out of the "On the this guys head-like-a-stone I will build my church" joke that Jesus told.|`|696ab48324d07c9880e5598c2ef06cc6aa	Not at all.

While the Apostles were courageous and hard working men that did the work that Jesus commanded them to do , namely the preaching and teaching work , they were nevertheless , men just like men are today.    The Bible clearly shows that they had faults , personality clashes and troubles that all people contend with.    While some may put another man up high and venerate and worship him , the scriptures CLEARLY say , that only the true God , who is Jehovah , is to be worshiped..      Not Mary , not Saints , not the Apsotles , NOT even Jesus ....    ONLY the true God -- who IS Jehovah deserve our worship and praise.

Don't ask me why you need secret handshakes and passwords you have to give to "sentries" to prove who you are to a god who supposedly knows every intimate detail of your life...I never understood the reasoning behind that.<br>  <br>  The church used to have in the temple ceremony gestures showing ways that your life would be taken (such as slitting your throat, cutting open your guts, etc.) if you revealed the secrets of the temple -- but it was freaking too many people out in the modern age, so they removed those from the temple rituals in 1990 even though they had been there since the 1850's and had been declared by every mormon prophet before that to be "the perfect ordinance of god" and "unchangeable."<br>  They were still doing them when I went through, and yeah -- it did freak me out to have to make a gesture showing how my throat would be slit if I told anybody about what went on in there.

Went from apprentice to 33rd degree mason in one day.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.longcounty.net/famousmasons.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.longcounty.net/famousmasons.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/jskabb1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnosis.org/jskabb1.htm</a><br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith and Kabbalah:<br>  The Occult Connection<br>  <br>  This work was originally published in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 27, No. 3, Fall 1994, pp. 117-194. The paper received considerable notice, and in 1995 the Mormon History Association recognized Joseph Smith and Kabbalah: The Occult Connection with its annual award for the best article in Mormon studies. There is an ongoing demand for this paper but unfortunately  Dialogue sold out its entire printing of the Fall, 1994 issue within a few weeks.  Most academic libraries will have Dialogue in their collection of journals for those seeking a print copy. <br>  More than two decades have passed since those words were penned, years marked by a veritable explosion in Mormon studies, and yet Edward's challenge "to find or create an epistemological methodology revolutionary enough to deal with the paradox" of Joseph Smith remains a summons largely unanswered. Revolutions are painful processes, in measure both destructive and creative. The imaginative revisioning of Joseph Smith's "unusual approach" to life and religion, demands a careful--though perhaps still difficult and destructive--hewing away of an hundred years of encrusting vilifications and thick layerings of iconographic pigments, masks ultimately false to his lively cast. Smith eschewed orthodoxy, and so eventually must his historians. To that end, there is considerable value in turning full attention to the revolutionary view of Joseph Smith provided by Harold Bloom in his critique of The American Religion. <br>  <br>  Broadly informed as a critic of the creative imagination and its Kabbalistic, Gnostic undertones in Western culture--and perhaps one of the most prominent literary figures in America--Bloom has intuitively recognized within Joseph Smith a familiar spirit, a genius wed in nature to both the millennia-old visions of Gnosticism in its many guises, and the imaginative flux of poesy. Individuals less informed in the history and nature of Kabbalism--or of Hermetic, Alchemical and Rosicrucian mysticism, traditions influenced by a creative interaction with Kabbalah--may have difficulty apprehending the basis of his insight. Indisputably, the aegis of "orthodox" Mormon historiography is violently breached by Bloom's intuition linking the prophet's visionary bent with the occult aspirations of Jewish Kabbalah, the great mystical and prophetic tradition of Israel. <br>  <br>  Bloom is, of course, not a historian but a critic and interpreter of creative visions, and his reading of Smith depends perhaps less on historical detail than on his intuition for the poetic imagination. The affinity of Smith for these traditions is, nonetheless, evident to an educated eye.<br>  <br>  What is clear is that Smith and his apostles restated what Moshe Idel, our great living scholar of Kabbalah, persuades me was the archaic or original Jewish religion. . . . My observation certainly does find enormous validity in Smith's imaginative recapture of crucial elements, elements evaded by normative Judaism and by the Church after it. The God of Joseph Smith is a daring revival of the God of some of the Kabbalists and Gnostics, prophetic sages who, like Smith himself, asserted that they had returned to the true religion. . . . Either there was a more direct Kabbalistic influence upon Smith than we know, or, far more likely, his genius reinvented Kabbalah in the effort necessary to restore archaic Judaism.|`|AA11636949	The temple garments are a physical reminder of the sacred covenants that we make in the temples.

To bind means to forbid or be unlawful and to loose is to allow or be lawful. This Apostolic authority is only valid when used in submission to Christ's word or teaching. It does not give the church the authority to make up new teachings later in church history.    Forgiving sin is a separate matter altogether.  Only God can forgive sin.

The point you make about people building themselves up by hiding behind the religion si very valid.  They go to church, but do they really believe Chirst is their Savior or do they believe they are everybody else's savior.  People must remember that even if it's a moment before death, and you give yourself to Christ, He will know if you are being honest.  Belief/Faith gets you to heaven not works. I like the statment you made about waving the banner of Christianity.  You know the life you lead will wave the banner for you if you believe in Christ.  Everyone will know you are a believer and you will not have to wave it.  Next time you see the woman, in a humble tone and not an accusing tone, ask her if your boyfriend found the Lord the second before his death, would be be in Heaven?  Her answer will tell you whether she is a true believer in Christ, or just a banner waver.

As tragic as his death is, it sounds like you are gaining strength and wisdom from the experience.<br>  <br>  As for that lady... I really wish I had an answer for you, but instead will share a personal story:<br>  Many yrs ago I became pregnant by my then boyfriend. I was hospitalized for complication and eventually miscarried a few days after being released from the hospital.<br>  While in the hospital I had a nurse tell me that my miscarriage was my punishment from God for having premarital sex and that I should be glad that I wasn't going to give birth to a bastard.<br>  <br>  I believe that such "christians" are so fearful that they aren't good enough to get into heaven that they feel that anyone that does wrong in their eyes must certainly be in for the wrath of God.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	My thought is Why do the mean and insensitive get all the reaction from you and not the kind and sensitive ? <br>  <br>  Sure there are such a**es but that shouldn't surprise anybody.|`|rx20pKgOaa	My daughter dated a young man for almost a year and stayed friends with him even after they broke up.  About a year after high school he committed suicide.  <br>  <br>  I have faith that the Lord will take all things into consideration and many times mental illness all but removes one's free agency.  <br>  <br>  I am sorry for your loss and sorry that you have met insensitive people. But yes, sometimes the most insensitive individuals are in the very places where we seek comfort. <br>  <br>  No one can answer "why" some can be so insensitive but know that you are not alone in your grief and the Lord will help you through difficult times.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	It really sucks that your boyfriend committed suicide, but honestly, some people are just like that, and the only thing that you can do is to ignore them. Sadly, they honestly believe that just because they go to church, they are christian, in much the same way that if i sleep in a garage, i'm a car. I hope that the death of your bf makes you stronger emotionally and spiritually. God bless, and good luck.|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	That is so sad. I would give you hug if I could. It is not kind to say things like that to someone in pain. God knows the heart of all people. Your boyfriend must have been in a great deal of pain to take his own life. Trust that God is more fair and understanding then people. Jesus, died for our sins, past, present and future. You seem to have developed a more Christ-like attitude toward insensitive people because of this sorrow. God uses our pain to make us more like Him. God Bless.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Some people take the Bible WAAAY too literally. And you can see why that is a problem.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry people are treating you this way, but I doubt that anyone who commits suicide actually goes to hell and I'm a Christian.<br>  <br>  I believe that someone who committed suicide would go to Purgatory to eventually be in Heaven with God.|`|hmU2udmRaa	those people would probably be jerks even if they weren't christians.  christianity (or religion in general) just gives them more things to be a jerk about.  i think religion is kind of like alcohol.  if something is already present, religion will only amplify it.  if you're a good person, religion might make you a better person.  if you're a bad person, most likely, religion will turn you into a d*ck.
spbqfjvbaa	No.  If you feel the urge to acknowledge Ash Weds & the begining of lent, so be it.  It's not harming, nor sacrilige to anyone.|`|AA11923447	No, it wouldn't. I have a Pagan friend who receives the imposition of ashes every year. One need not be a Christian in order to participate in this rite. However, if you didn't find any significance in it, I'm not sure why you'd do it. Still, I'm happy to see people of all faiths (and of no faith) checking out Ash Wednesday services, or any other rites that the church has to offer. It's an educational experience, if nothing else. When I receive the ashes tonight, at least two non-Christians will be right beside me (including a Buddhist).

ZmdIlkpQaa	I used to be a bouncer during the boat races on the Columbia River every year, and things could get pretty wild.  On the job, it was no big deal, you just dealt with it, but one night after work, a friend and I had stopped to get a bite to eat, and the partiers were mostly winding down for the night.  We had just stepped outside the burger joint, and I was lighting a smoke when we heard a scuffle and some yelling down the alley.  Four guys had this other guy surrounded, and were calling him anti-Gay names (I'm sure you know the ones I mean).  I dropped my smoke and started down the alley, and my buddy asked what I was doing, and actually said the guy getting picked on probably deserved it.  I came down the alley and started shouting for them to stop and break out ID, and they took off, probably thinking I was a cop or an off duty, at least.  At any rate, the guy they had been picking on was pretty beat up, but I got him to an aid station and then went home.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	The big joke in my house is mom is the Citizen on Patrol...being the Daughter of a family of crime fighters it is in the Blood!

I saw a couple of young men standing to my left as<br>  I was at the register.I noticed that one was trying on a gold chain<br>  necklace. I turned to acknowledge that they were there and I was<br>  ready to help them. The man with the necklace and his friend, turned<br>  and walked away with the chain on his neck. I called security, and<br>  they came as the two men were leaving the store. She followed them<br>  through the mall, but didn't stop them. She came back to me and<br>  said, she would have had to see them take something. My seeing<br>  them was not enough. So there went a gold chain from inventory. I<br>  guess she was hoping they would steal from another store and then<br>  she could step forward. I sometimes wonder, if all department stores<br>  have that same policy today.

The first one was when I was seven. I had just been into the dentist to have four teeth removed and was still heavily sedated when I left the clinic. I stumbled out into the car with my mum and dad when two burglars smashed the window of a jewelery shop across the street and grabbed all the jewels out of the display. My dad got out the car and chased after them but they got away. When the police turned up they got everyone in the area to help them find any jewels amongst the broken glass. I doubt the police would let people help them like that today!|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I worked evenings about 24 years ago and got home about 1:00 a.m., came in and got a drink, turned off the light and went to bed. Lived out in the country next to an intersection. A car with a bad muffler sat at the stop sign for about 3 minutes, thought it was strange for a running car to set there so long and got up and watched as the driver pulled into the country convenience store across the street. Two guys got out and threw a milk crate threw the window and broke in. Called the police but the time they drove out there they were long gone and never got caught.  Another time my dog kept barking and barking, I peeked out the window and saw about 4 pair of white athletic shoes walking behind the trailer used for cattle feed parked next to the store. They were moving around, I called the manager who lived about a mile away that time, and he drove out there and they ran off.|`|ztzEloj5aa	i have witnessed drug deals, hit and run, someone beating another person, someone stealing a car...<br>  nothing i can do- for fear of my own life|`|AA12363470	yes the bush administration taking us to war in iraq, after being told by his generals not to.|`|nqK0BQUTaa	I caught the person.

baW9sSsLaa	Actually, just the opposite.  Quantum scientists are only now catching up with what witches have known for centuries--that an exercise of Will can influence the outcome of events.<br>  <br>  On the Planck scale--the basement level of reality as far as we can tell, usually referred to as the quantum scale--things often happen that seem impossible on a larger scale.  There are, for instance, documented observations of a single particle being in more than one place at the same time.  Particles move from one place to another without actually crossing the space between point a and point b.  Most importantly, as far as this question is concerned, observers can make things happen BY WANTING THEM TO HAPPEN.<br>  <br>  In other words, at the most basic level of reality, we can influence what happens.  This doesn't make much difference on our scale, at first--but influence enough energy in a single direction, and it does start to have a measurable difference.  Get enough people "pushing" in the same direction all at once, and there are not only visible but immediate and tangible results.<br>  <br>  The key is the dedication of effort.  There are an awful lot of things happening in the universe with a multitude of forces that influence events, and its difficult for most people to even imagine that they can push hard enough to make something happen.  Sometimes, we can't, because the forces at work are too firmly established in opposition.  It's unlikely that a spell will ever help me win the lottery, for instance, because millions of people are wanting the exact same thing, in opposition to my own desire.  Just as I could not cause the world to spin in reverse, or even slow down, because it's been spinning constantly for millenia, and my efforts would be laughable even if they could be detected.<br>  <br>  But there are a myriad of other things that we can effect--our own health, for instance, strengthening our bodies against disease.  Prosperity--not necessarily money or wealth, but having the resources you need to be comfortable.  We can attract or repel certain other influences that we find desirable or not.<br>  <br>  In any case, if you continue to have the attitude that it's all "useless", then rest assured it will be--to you.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	I'm a pagan. I am not trying to get in the face of anyone. I practise my own beliefs and leave everyone else to there's--most people in real life don't even know it. As for your question, no, well, maybe--<br>  <br>  You mean like 'all that was' exploding and becoming the world as it is now...? Oh wait. <br>  <br>  Well...what about that silly Celtic belief that energy cannot be destroyed? Huh. <br>  <br>  Or the idea that foxglove could treat heart problems...oh wait, my grandfather was put on a derivative of foxglove by his doctor. <br>  <br>  You see where I'm going with this? Just because it's old doesn't or been neglected my most doesn't mean it's not true. <br>  <br>  As far as idol worship, no one actually worships the idol, they worship what it represents, the deity they feel it embodies. Science cannot rule out the existence of gods. <br>  <br>  As for spellcraft, it is seen as manipulation of energy, not creation of it, and keep in mind that what we can explain through science and tecnology now, such as the creation of metal would have seemed like (and to them was) magic at the time, <br>  <br>  Has science proven spells don't work? What about love spells? What about "coincidences" that tend to happen when such things are mentioned, even historically that are statistically significant?|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	It's not a step backwards, as someone already pointed out, pagans have been doing things that science is just now catching up on.  Some herbs/plants slow bleeding, stop burning, help with tooth aches, and many more.  Science and meds are doing the same thing in a lab that pagans many many generations have been doing. . . only thing different is they're mocking pagans and those that came before them while doing it.<br>  "oh look at me I found this new med that you can use to numb your mouth before dentail work."<br>  okay, we've had that, moving on. . .<br>  <br>  btw, pagan isnt an "organized religion." it is a blanket term (I'm sure you've heard this before if you've been on this site for more then 2 days). . .it is many different religions. . .and I as a pagan follow my own path and my own rules that I've thought about and came to the point was right for me.  But the new moon thing is more likely confused with the void moon, that's another pagan thing you'd mostlikely mock in not understanding.  People plant their gardens, schedule surgeries, and many other things based on the moon phases.  The moon (as science admits) controls the tides, the term lunatic comes from people acting funny/different on the full moon.<br>  <br>  So the whole point of me answering this is, science likes to think they're the only right ones. . . but I'm a pagan who is very intersted in sceince and such, so I get the pleasure of studying science and comparing it to history (religious history).|`|BLnXhWoTaa	you really should learn about what we believe before you try to criticize us.  magic works quite well for me, thank you.  and the living god who called me is quite up to date on science and stuff.  i don't practice my religion to be in anyone's face, i pracitice it because it's what makes the most sense to me.<br>  <br>  there are a lot of ignorant people in all beliefs, including atheists, obviously.|`|7cBOKehWaa	Funny... I'm both a Pagan with major Wiccan beliefs AND a staunch acceptor of evolution, and all proven sciences for that matter.|`|lVHBqDJEaa	I don't think so.

I don't see them as a step backwards, but just as another way of trying to understand the world around us, and to approach it in spiritual terms. Not all Pagans do spellcasting, of course, but I don't necessarily see what's wrong with it. Casting a spell is a type of ritual. Almost all religions have rituals. For instance, I will be attending an Ash Wednesday ritual tonight. Perhaps somewhere else, at the same time, a Wiccan might be casting a spell. Ritual is a highly important part of some people's cultures and religions.|`|LjsRfaskaa	In a way yes. Just the same as religions are counter evolutionary with spirituality. They are not the same things.<br>  <br>  A religion as an organization. Being religious means you belong to a  particular organization. <br>  <br>  Spirituality is the concept that it does not matter what you believe because, which ever way you look at it, whether its from an external god, or scientifically from energy to matter. It does not matter because we are all fragments of the Universal Consciousness and as such we are all divine beings whose value is immeasurable. Individual beliefs are irrelevant with such a concept. <br>  <br>  We are not an ego, not a physical body with spiritual aspirations, but the complete opposite. It does not take much to change in the blink of an eye.<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman.. .quantum physics rocks|`|vTvsgVJiaa	How is it any more counter-evolutionary than Catholicism saying evoloution in itself is wrong?  By that theory, nobody can evolve period!.  Anyway, its just a religion, its not really about spell casting, it is more about believing that Mother Nature is a powerful force who controls various things in the world.  You don't cast spells like they do in the movies, you call to the universe to get the things you need and want and solve your problem, much like people that believe in God pray to him to help them with this that and the other thing.  It's really a far cry from what you think it is!|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I agree.  The problem with religion today is that the culture has outgrown the metaphors.  The ideas are fine, but the symbols are often misunderstood because they have no significance to a modern person.  Going back even further to polytheism is the wrong path in my opinion.|`|QaT680QHaa	I have to disagree although I am not exactly Wiccan I can relate to the idea of Polytheism, magick, and self awareness. <br>  You simply cannot argue with those of us who have witnessed the power of what we are capable of. <br>  Are you of the opinion that one single god is evolutionary in some way?|`|wwdllMzYaa	wicca is based on paganism<br>  paganism is older than christianty, in fact its one of the oldest belief systems<br>  thats thousands of years of tradition<br>  <br>  <br>  neo pagansim is just a way to say  different kinds of pagans<br>  not new pagans<br>  paganism is old, so are pagans<br>  pagansim isnt an "organised religion"<br>  its a branch of many religions, and many belife systems<br>  wicca is one of these branches<br>  its just more recent<br>  <br>  however wiccans, peopel using nature for spiritual and magical purposes,  have been around for as long as paganism<br>  and probably as long as humans<br>  they just were not called wicacns<br>  <br>  these are just labels, not actual descriptions<br>  <br>  science hasnt proven eveyrthing<br>  its only theorised and marginaly proven the things it has<br>  you should open your mind to life around you, andnot rely soley on science <br>  <br>  science is just the answers that human sciencest havent found yet, or have found but cant understand<br>  they are not full answers on anything<br>  <br>  and most wicans are 'pro' science, <br>  pagansim isnt at all like othe rreligions<br>  thats why its the most rational one<br>  its a life and energy based one<br>  both of which are scientific facts

So if you don't like what someone tells you, open the book for yourself.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Please understand that Christians believe the words of Jesus Christ, who stated very clearly, on many occasions, that He was the only way to salvation.    If a person believes this to be so, they will be honest and not compromise this belief.  If Jesus truly is the only way, look at it from our perspective; why would we give you false hope in any other?    It's done out of love.  If we didn't care about others, we would not take the risk of pointing to the cross of Christ, which generates such fury among those who do not believe.  We believe this to be true; that the only name under heaven by which anyone might be saved is Jesus Christ.|`|47sALOGfaa	Accept Jesus or ROT IN HELL FOREVER!|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Christians are ridicilous, their logic makes no sense.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	You're making the mistake of not understanding what we can be sent to hell for.  We are not sent there because we do not believe in God.  We are sent there because of the sins that we have all commited.  God created a way for us to be forgiven, by having the only perfect man (Jesus) take our sins upon Himself.      It's Christ or the highway because we have all sinned, and if we don't accept the gift He offers, we can't received the pardon.  Think of it like a courtroom.  If you have a million dollar fine, and someone offers to pay that fine for you, you still have to accept that.     If you're really truly curious and want to know more, please email me and I'll be glad to answer any questions you have :)|`|FpMS47sXaa	Nothing wrong with being curious.    As part of the faith, yes, one must accept Jesus Christ as the son of God, that his life did exist, that he came to show us the right way to life, and that he died to pay the punishment we all face on our judgment day.    I don't like when people push this idea and tell people they are going to Hell. I find that rude and counter productive. I have yet to meet one person in my life that decided to become Christian after hearing "turn or burn".    As to why we believe this? It's part of the whole idea, I suppose. Maybe it gives Jesus' life meaning. Maybe it's "holy" justification for the wrongs that have gone unpunished. Maybe it's just something one must do to order to prove their faith.    I didn't write the book or lay down any laws. If I had, I would have been a lot less strict.    Anyone can become a Christian. It does not matter what you have done in the past. We are all worthy. All can and will be forgiven and forgotten, if you want it. But, in all comes down to a choice.      I hope you realize that I do not hate you. I do not want anything bad to happen to you. I know that only you can make any choices for you - and whatever you choose, I respect it.|`|e57c7db914fb45d19d9afc6f475d8c37aa	You know, my wife is that way too..

Very single minded woman, but we get along well, as I feel the same way..    There is only one God, and only one way to have your sins forgiven and that is through Jesus.     All of mankind is doomed to hell, and needs to be saved.   If you don't want to be saved, then don't accept salvation.  Accept something else..  but just because it doesn't get you to heaven don't be mad at God.    I won't tell you anything about any religion, but the God that created this planet will take it back and if you don't like him, then you won't be allowed to live here.

It does not matter what people say unless they speak the Word of God ...|`|uAMzmAwaaa	its not "our way or the highway" its "God's way or the highway" the reason why if you are not saved you cannot get into heaven is because our sin keeps us out.    and to be saved its not just saying "im sorry" you actually have to mean it. so if you did murder and you honestly repented then you will be saved.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	Murderers do not go to heaven.

(11)  And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.    Why to we believe that you must be a Christian to get to heaven? That's what Jesus said and we believe Him..  John 14:6  Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.    If you don't believe what Jesus said, you must not believe he was much of a prophet then, right?|`|eWObKmBSaa	In the Bible, it says;  JOhn 3:16  For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Hm should not perish, but have eternal life.    Jesus says, : I am the way, the truth and the light, no one comes to the Father but by me.    You get down on your knees, in a quiet place, you ask Jesus to come into your heart and forgive you for your sins.  He sees inside you and knows if you are really wanting his peace.  He can forgive you.  Ever since Adam and Eve ate the apple, everybody knows that story but not all believe that was the first sin, in the world.  YOu see anything that we do, that displeases God, is a sin.  Jesus says, a man/woman can receive nothing unless it is given to him by God.  You can't receive life unless it is given to you by God.  I mean real life, real peace in your life, only Jesus can give that to you.  Yes, one day, we will all stand before our God, rather you believe it or not, we will all stand before God.  If your name isn't in the lambs book of life, then some people will go to hell.  Hell is real, read in the last book of the Bible, Revelation.  Hell is real, I pray that you ask someone how to accept Jesus into your heart and do not have to see hell, yes it is real.    John 3:5 Jesus said, unless one is born again, he can't see the kingdom of God.    You see God's kingdom is heaven.  Unless a person has truly asked Jesus to forgive them of their sins, and asked Him into their heart, they will go to hell.  But as many as received HIm, to them He gave the right to become children of GOd, even to those who believe in His name.    that is believeing in the name of God.    Go to the Bible and read the first chapter of  the Gospel of John.|`|XNGRQlmDaa	Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.       Jesus Christ made it exclusive, not Christians. If you're not happy with the answer then you might want to take it up with the one who said it.|`|nzwYJbEFaa	but yet can never produce any quote made directly from Jesus saying i am god worship me|`|31b9d943eeebee817b486384aaf5dc76aa	Because that is what they are taught. That's the basis of the Christian religion - belief in Jesus as personal savior is the only way to heaven.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Not 'our way',  His Way!!  (John 14:6, and Acts 4:10-12.)  Plus alot more verses!  (Because of The Resurrection and the FACT that He died for you and gave you opportunity to Live Forever!)  |`|mcbCXWJaaa	LOST    They don't have logic.|`|xsCYdzdlaa	THe bible says that there will be many surprises when we reach heaven and i, as a christian, believe that others will also reach heaven. As long as they have stayed true to God and have not judged and have treated everyone with the same respect and also fear his name.    A murder can go to heaven if he or she repents for having done the sin. Once after this they will not commit murder again and will dedicate themselves to the lord because the have seen the sacrifice that Jesus did which was dying on the cross.    Allah is the same God that christians worship so i truthfully dont know why someone would tell you that.|`|LHjnWCfnaa	Christians don't believe that. ..Or maybe the ones you know, but not me. As long as you believe that Jesus is the Son of God and he died for your sins, that's all that matters. ...You go to heaven if you have that faith and you try to live your life for God. Murderers can go to heaven if they have repented and since then, have tried to live a Godly life.     ...Basically, you have to know the true God and Jesus. Christians know the truth and maybe sometimes people see us as it's "my way or the highway" but that's only because we go by the Bible, the Only book that actually has a translation of what was written all those years ago, while many other religions rewrite what is in the Bible by what thEy beliEve really happened. ...so really, it's "God's way, or the highway" ...Idk if you understand me, but I hope you do.|`|AA11952133	I have found that Muslims do believe in the bible as a whole and they do say that while they call God Allah, (because they speak Arabic), that it is just another name for Jehovah (Psalms 83:18)    I found my way to Christianity because I found it to agree with the my belief in how God wants to be worshiped.  I believe that is what most people that believe in God do also.    I used this criteria:    Based on true universal love  (no fighting with anyone else, no matter where they live)  Pray to one God  Avoid things that harm yourself    After studying many religions, including Islam, Quakers, and a few others, I chose Jehovah's Witnesses because I believe in the bible and they follow it the closest.|`|Cqr1sffjaa	That is correct.. christians do believe this.  All of it.    It is written that without Yahshua you can not make it to the Reign/Kingdom of Heaven.  If you read Revelation you can come to understand that it is talking about emulating his actions, in living righteously.  Rev. 12:17 ..."those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the testimony of Yahshua.".  As well as Yochanan was exiled to Patmos in Rev 1:9 "....because of the word of god and the testimony of Yahshua."  There is NO way another man can live in me.    Many religions speak of good workd that lead you to righteousness, in Bhuddism you have the 8-fold path, for instance.  Can one truly believe that there are NOT true believers outside of our Way?  Look at Balaam before he apostacized, he was not of Yisrael, nor was Yethro the Midianite Priest and Father-in-law of Moshe.  That leads us further back to Melkhitsedek the Priest and King of Salom. He was NOT a child of Avraham as far as we know.      1 Corinth. 10:23, Saul/Paul stated "For me ALL things are Lawful...", insinuating that he can live as he wishes forsaking the instructions of god.  Thus giving license to sin.  What is sin? in 1 John 3:4 "sin is violation/transgession of the Law/Instruction.|`|tCmwFJn5aa	Many Christians are quick to judge and they are ignorant to Islam.  We all have 1 God, the Creator.
kytCFy4waa	im an atheist and even though i really dont see WHY religious people believe what they believe, i admire the fact that those who pursue being good christians, buddhists, hindus, muslims, etc., to the fullest  i cant stand, for example, my christian friends who go out and party on saturday and show up in church on sunday, and then criticize everyone on monday but still call themselves christians  congratulate those you know who live up to the expectations of their religions, as for the hypocrites, be human to them even if they arent human to you|`|PVrTjt6jaa	Given that thousands of years have passed and there still are more examples of religion-based atrocities than benefits, I would say that your hope is in vain.  The bigotry, violence, and intellectual suppression found everywhere in religious doctrine are cause for despair.   Still, your hope is admirable.|`|gqu0Ocubaa	As a Christian, I can only strive to be the best I could.  I do not judge anyone's heart by what I hear and see.  In fact, I refuse to judge.  As a Christian, I struggle everyday with faith (like everyone else, I think).  I see other religious people go to Church and not do what is instructed them.  It use to bother me a lot, but now I only worry about my own.  What I do is between me and God.  I will never be perfect, but I strive to do my best.    Some of my friends do not believe in God, and they have the same expectation as you do.  It is their own decision to do that, and I cannot change what they think.  I only hope that they don't base thier conclusion on what they hear and see --> because many Christians struggle with faith everyday (I do).|`|eomrfXrzaa	Not really.  I respect religious people as long as they don't force their beliefs on anyone else or berate people for being different (with either words or dynamite)|`|yywRjouyaa	No people use their faith to give them power.   Power can be used for good or bad..wanting it to be used for good isn't a bad thing at all.|`|QwKiK85eaa	No if your an Atheist you should have no faith lol|`|ulwXFrrJaa	That isn't faith.      Faith is something you believe without evidence.  That is hope.  Similar to faith.  But you don't believe in hope.  You don't have faith in hope.  Hope is only what you wish to happen.  not what you believe will.  If you believe theists will follow the true nature of religion, that is faith.  if you only would like them to, that is hope.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Not strange, but you have a very naive and romantic view of religion.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I think it abnormal to want people to fail just because you don't agree with them. We should all strive to be good people and expect the same out of other regardless of religious beliefs.    I am agnostic and I think religion is a good thing in most cases. It gives people hope and happiness, and motivation to be a good person. I only think it is bad when it is misused as an excuse for ignorance or to hurt people.|`|URO3gDXcaa	because you are an atheist you can't have hope?  come on.|`|lEignX9Vaa	I think any open-minded atheist would agree with you.

BTW, God has a plan and purpose for your life also. He is patient.|`|176PIYNVaa	No, it is not strange.    I am the same. I believe that religion does have a role in society. Some people need religions to have peace and purpose in life; and some people do not. It is a personal choice. As long as both sides exercise tolerance, world would be a better place to live.
rf6VdPt3aa	To do meaningful research and find meaningful answers to your questions you could try several approaches; 1-expand your search for answers to other fields like neurobiology and psychology, 2 make sure your sources are not biased, 3 frame your questions to reflect that you are seeking answers to questions rather than seeking validation of preconceived ideas.<br>  Someone has already noted that there is nothing new-that humans build on the ideas of the past.  You may consider this a semantic argument but there can be no cemetery of religions as humans are continually building their spiritual frameworks on concepts from the past.  Whether you reject a concept or accept it you are using it to build your own spiritual nature.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	exclusivity is a christian invention, even if they took the idea from the bhagavad gita, they misinterpreted krishna's words when they ascribe them to jesus, and gave us the first religion to unilaterally condemn all other faiths.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Funnily enough I asked that same question a few weeks ago.<br>  <br>  I got a big fat zero. <br>  <br>  I wonder if someone has found something. <br>  <br>  I'm all attention. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks .|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I think you're looking at it the wrong way.  Yes, the Bible employs classic mythological symbols and language every step of the way, but it does so to build on the spiritual knowledge of the past.  If we look at the latin roots re- and ligio- we see religion literally means linking back.  The Bible built on these traditions.  What it added was the notion that redemption is available to all people, not just a select nation, and that the key was compassion.|`|kEWknILEaa	Where is the Anti-Thor in Norse Mythology?

But then again, most religions have common running themes (which is why I find them all to be real, correct and/or valid). You can add to that list that the "all good/perfect" god and his "evil/all bad" nemisis was taken from Sumerian and Persian stuff... they borrowed a lot from the Sumerians, from what I've heard. <br>  So no, I think it's all borrowed.|`|cvp0SEBNaa	everyone borrowed from everyone else<br>  there are no new ideas under the sun<br>  <br>  i have a question though<br>  What makes something older?<br>  the date it was written down?|`|dmCAiuMGaa	Christianity isn't a myth, so the rest of your question isn't worth reading.  It's unfortunate you can't be respectful like most Atheists.  God and Christ are real.  Ignoring them won't make them non-existant.
FOzN3xwzaa	"Carbon 14 dating" does not work, because the earth has not reached equilibrium in terms of carbon 14, so you'd need to know the age of the fossil, to know the age of the fossil.  That's obvious circular reasoning.   How much C14 was in it when it lived?  Nobody can say.  And then, has the rate of decay been constant?  Nobody can say that either.  They throw out half of all results they get back.  So how do you know if either half is right?  The reality is that both halves are wrong.  One experiment had a freshly killed seal, carbon dated as 1,400 years old.  When you date a sample that is of known age, it is always inaccurate.  Some system!  So C14 dating is worthless.<br>  <br>  The "geologic column" is also circular reasoning, the layers dated by the fossils and the fossils dated by the layers, disrupted by petrified trees that go through all the layers.  These things are clearly not real science.  <br>  <br>  The layers really came from the Flood, in reality. <br>  <br>  It was claimed that humans and chimps have a genetic difference of 1.6%. That might not sound like a lot, but if you calculate it out, this represents 48,000,000 nucleotides, and a change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal. <br>  <br>  Interestingly, they now say it's 7.7% difference, not 1.6%, so they were wrong, as always. Not that it matters. It will probably change to be a higher number in the future. <br>  <br>  So none of this proves "evolution". This proves a common Creator. And the amino acids are the same among people and animals, so that we can eat animals. If the amino acids weren't the same, then we'd have to eat people.|`|u2cCUjOYaa	Since I believe in the fundamentals of the faith but most of all I believe that Christ died for my sins.

If evolution is thrue then there should be no monkeys or apes today, they would all be humans. Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	There is as much false science as there is false religion. Evolution is what happens when things reproduce.

D2K4nTEIaa	The assurance is our firm belief that God is fair, faithful, just and merciful.

wB3AbJyLaa	Hell isn't a torture chamber. Hell is about relationships, broken relationships. In the Bible, hell is separation or banishment from the most beautiful being in the world, God himself. It's exclusion not only from God but also from those who have come to know and love him. Hell is a punishment for having broken God's standards and is a natural consequence of choosing to be separate from God. Hell is a punishment, but not punishing. The punishment of hell is separation from God and the shame, anguish, and regret that go along with it. The pain may be both mental and physical, but it will be the pain and sorrow of final, eternal banishment from God and the good life for which we were created. Hell is the final sentence that says you refuse regularly to live in relationship with God, and the inevitable result of that choice is to be sent away from God for all eternity. So it is punishment. But it's also the natural consequence of a life that has been lived in a certain direction.|`|Yhy5jtsNaa	i was a christian and on here showing my faith but the thought of hell has turned me into a deist, like you said, what is the point of hell, why would someone allow me to be born if i was gonna suffer forever, i tried believing christianity but it didn't work for me, i just think part of religion is just people trying to find God, don't get me wrong i think God has spoken to people and does answer some prayers but i just dont believe in "do what i say not as i do" i just believe he takes a good look at everything about yourself and creates a heaven to suit you, not worship me and try to guess the right religion or suffer forever|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You have it backwards...IF you go to HELL it was a serious offense.

(mad at this point) and said leave in the name of jesus and since then ive never felt the bad spirit following me again.. thank God<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ps.. if more than one person has felt this than evil spirits are proven to be real|`|F0UF9DDeaa	I am not a pilot, but I have had those same feelings in different areas of life. I can feel GOD's presence in a lot of life's events and some times find my self looking around to see who is there. GOD is with us and he will help us if we call on him. He controls all, and we have to turn and trust to what is in his will. I always turn to prayer. I let GOD confront my opposer and let his will be done in my life as it should be. <br>  <br>   You know some times when I try doing everything on my own I find it all going wrong, but when I turn it over to GOD and pray that he does as he sees fit, then everything turns for the better.|`|PWankIUpaa	I am sorry that you have not chosen to follow God . however Jesus protected you anyway either because you will come to faith in Him one day or because you had Christians on board who were needed for His purpose. <br>  <br>  God Bless you and keep you safe through His only Begotten Son Jesus.|`|f883f94d3a771813d0e22175b7e5178caa	You really should not openly admit hearing and seeing things in the cockpit of your airplane.

That's interesting.  I can see now that pilots go through many intense moments!!!  That's good your co-pilot is a Christian.  Perhaps this entity (demon?) thought it was his chance to intimidate you and possibly cause a great deal of trouble, since the co-pilot had been in the lavatory so much.<br>  <br>  I hope you take an extra pair of pants or outfit with you on the flight!  Do you?  This would be too embarrassing if you didn't have a good way of taking care of it.
6lJuKKMHaa	lol.  Sorry, just not my 'cup-of-tea'.  :)|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Nope, to quote J Gresham Machen:    "The heart cannot hold onto what the head has rejected"|`|lEignX9Vaa	A belief by definition cannot be "chosen" as in say, tomorow I will choose to be christian, then next week I will choose to be hindu...    But a belief isn't something you are born with, it is the result of weighing different things and comming to a conclusion of which one you believe to be the most true. This process can be somewhat seen as "choosing" what to believe because you are deciding what makes sense and what doesn't.    Beliefs can be manipulated through peer pressure, brainwashing etc. But you can't choose what you believe in, it either makes sense to you or it doesn't. All you choose is what makes most sense.      Now decide if what i said makes sense, then you either believe or disbelieve it.

Doing something like that without being required to is very gratifying.<br>  <br>  Also, travel is probably the single most entertaining thing to do.  Especially if you can get someone fun to come with you.  I've spent weeks at a time in Europe, and those weeks are easily the best of my life.  But you don't have to travel to Venice to have a good time.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, there are probably all kinds of places near you that you have never been to.  Also, if you have an interest in something, go learn how to do it.  Sign up for private music lessons, or painting, or take karate.  You can always find a teacher for this or that, and learning to do something that you enjoy can be a whole load of fun.<br>  <br>  I imagine, from your post, that you are in high school?  <br>  You might be able so register for some classes at a local community college.  College is a whole new world compared to high school, and taking any sort of classes there might prove to be fun (pick a subject you like!)

J7KSKm54aa	In my last life, during the last session, I was the daughter of Om and Azna. Om and Azna were the Son and Daughter of God in that session and the Gods in Hebew were Don and Linda. So Anthony and I were like our children in this lifetime- Michael and Autumn. My name was Julie and Anthony's name was Don. Om's name was Don and Azna's name was Dory.  The difference is that Om and Azna are husband and wife in Hebew, so Anthony and I were their children. In this life time, Anthony and I wanted to incarnate with our husband and wife from Hebew, so we were to each have a child. Except our Daughter is now with me and she is the granddaughter of Om's Begotten Daughter- or my Sister-In -Law, Ana. Anyways, that was one of my past lives.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	My past life was before Christ. I was a heathen in my past life....Now I am a Christ follower.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Younger...thinner, less stressed!!! Thanks!for the td...|`|xLKPKgZXaa	In the sense that you refer to a past life the answer is NO, we did not exist prior to our birth in this body. However, this life  does not start out that well as we are all born in sin.  We will all sin but we can enter a new, better life if we confess our sins and ask Jesus to forgive us. He died to take our punishment so we should thank Him for that then live with the knowledge that we are no longer under condemnation.|`|PPvk105Caa	I believe so, there's no proof & we'll never know unless we remember etc.  But I have a strong feeling I was someone who died very young, maybe like 16 or so, hence I'm very shy & always been, I can't seem to get out of it.   Sometimes I get these weird dreams where I'm having conversations with people who I have no idea who they are, & I can see myself but it's someone else.|`|bYqWHuzyaa	What?

8pQrIL90aa	If you were a father, would you give everything to your son and have him lay around your house all day doing nothing to build character? to show responsibility? You must think about this my friend, because you will not die and go into the dirt, but you will rise from the dead and be judged and brought into eternity with GOD. People believe that in eternity there will be no work, but there is work there just as there is work here.    Would you want a son who does not have a solid, strong character, or would you want you son to be lazy and useless around your house all day with his hand out? This not the way that God meant the world to be, but this is the way that man is conditioned to go into eternity.    Pray that God increase your faith, and seek him out for your life. You will do good my friend to follow after Jesus.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	No decent parent provides their children with everything they want.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	i ask myself the same thing...  theres only one answer, that there is no god.   if there was, would there be war right now? if god was so real, why isnt there peace on earth?    can't wait for the thumbs down.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	It has a little to do with something called sin.

The only reason you'll take another breath on this planet is because He granted it to you. He owes you nothing. He gave you life and abundance.   Look around you, man...

He is everywhere. You can't see Him? You can't hear Him?  He needs to do something good, "once in His existence?" He gave you the miracle of life, probably a healthy body and if you're fortunate enough to be an American, you're more fortunate than most of the people who have walked on this planet before you or will after you.    Good grief.     Father God, please reveal Yourself to this man, Andre. And forgive him, for he knows not what he says. Open his eyes so that he might see. Open his ears that he might hear.

"What is with the Hide and Seek he been playing?"  hes not playing hide and seek, you just choose to ignore him    "He needs to do something Good, for once in his existence."  everything he does is good, and everything he allows is either good or will be used to turn into good.    "Make everyone rich or something."  God doesn't care about money, and we shouldn't either    "God should do something.

Think of it this way, two kids want a car when they get their licenses. One kid, we'll call him Bob, is given a car, the other , we'll call him Chris had to work a long time cutting  grass to earn the money to buy his car. Which one do you suppose would take better care of what he has? Logic would tell you that Chris would most likely take better care of his vehicle due to the fact that he knows exactly how much it cost and how much work it took to get it. This is also why God does not just give us everything. If we don't know the value of something, then we don't know the worth of it. This basic principle crosses over into every facet of  life. Don't believe me? Have  you ever met someone to whom everything was given to them as a child.

So true!|`|FLAtdWrmaa	All churches are social organizations.  Pretty much all religions are social organizations.<br>  <br>  Think about what happens in buildings or groups or great gatherings of people, in the cause of something having to do with their own religious beliefs.  They are only there for what they think they can get from or give to other people who share their beliefs.  <br>  <br>  Life-changing religious "epiphanies" are rare, and those who've had them describe a sense of overpowering glory they can't adequately describe. These moments are, to me, just about *the* most important element of any person's religious life.  But surprisingly few of them occur in church, or during any form of (group) religious services.  They are *extremely* personal.<br>  <br>  The real reason for church services and religious gatherings is to bounce religious ideas back and forth, and for the religious "strongmen" (they're not all the official leaders in their religious communities) to see that everyone all follows the same code.  The actual codes change over time, even within the most consistent communities, but it's a social imperative that all members believe the same thing at any one time.<br>  <br>  People who don't share the code get kicked out or are quietly pushed out, or else they take themselves out before their dissonance reaches that point in the church.  That's why there are policies of some members scrutinizing the prayers and prayer habits of others -- as well as critiquing people's other personal religious activities.  <br>  <br>  Isn't God (or the gods, or the Goddess) the only one who should be concerned about what you're praying for? And how you do it, and how often?  And where and what time of day?  Why does any other human being have any right to say anything at all about another person's praying?  Prayer is a private business, always -- not to be shared!  Critiques are pure self-righteous arrogance on the part of the scrutineers.  And that's a social problem, not a godly one.  <br>  <br>  You can see what has happened to me on my religious journey.  This is all a roundabout way of saying, this sounds like what happened to you, though yours may be on a bit smaller a scale.  (I'm guessing that you're way younger than me, which accounts for it).  Good luck, wherever your interest and instincts take you.|`|jx9YnFV8aa	The real question here should be do you go to church to be entertained or to be blessed by the grace of God? There has to be an element of faith that brings you to the presence of God, otherwise, why sit there and be part of something that simply bores you.<br>  <br>    As a young person,  I think you sometimes feel discounted because of the fact that you lack experience or that you are not taken serious because you still have much to learn about life. Perhaps your former church community failed to address your needs by not providing a more faith nourishing atmosphere. If all they did was put on rock concerts to gain your attention, then shame on them! I would argue that popular music was intended to entice you to come and be a part of the faith community, but not as a sole source of spiritual fulfillment. That has to come from within. <br>    You have to accept God into your life and ask him through prayer to help you understand his purpose for your life. You have to keep coming back to experience the gift of grace that is offered. I would suggest a search for a new church that does that for you. Being Catholic, I find the gift of communion and the sacraments as outward signs of God's grace. Jesus instituted these signs as a way for people to fully experience his saving grace. As the original Christian church, I urge you to check it out and see what God has in store for you other than merely being entertained. I hope this has helped answer your question in some way.
dcDY9pJeaa	No one subscribes to social darwinism or nazism except ignorant people,    All humans are equal,  and we evolved - like all life on Earth has|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	WARNING - Answer may contain objective facts.  If you wish to maintain a cherished misconception or belief do not read.    Evolutionists, do you perceive all human beings as equals?     (Yes they are equals before any God but they are not equals in any objective sense. The women operating the checkouts at the local supermarket are on average intellectually, and sometimes physically and maybe even morally inferior to some I know who have Masters degrees or PhDs in this or that.  There are plenty of people who are dumber, weaker, lazier etc than you or I and plenty who are smarter, stronger and more energetic.  That is the way thing are.)      Im sure youve heard people say that we are all created equal. But of course, you dont like the idea of being created.      (Who said so?  You? I don't particularly care either way.  In addition, evolution works if life was created by God or if it was a self organising chemical process.  Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population of organisms.  Note the word "population".  That implies many organisms.  It does not, repeat not have anything to do with the appearance or creation of life on Earth, no matter what some people say.  One regular on these pages, "Spazzy McGee" recently wrote that he had never seen a creationist describe or define evolution correctly.  Neither have I.)    But anyways, are human beings all equals? I suppose most of you accept Social Darwinism, but doesnt that create problems?       (Beware, strawman argument.  No, those who know that evolution is a fact do not neccesarily accept Social Darwinism.  That was invented by or for what might have been called "robber barons" to justify their rapacious business practices. It is a major leg in the "philosophy" invented by Ayn Rand during the 1950s and is pretty clearly expressed in her novel,  "Atlas Shrugged".)       When you think about it, the idea of evolution devalues human life.     (Evolution is not an idea, it is a biological fact, just like combustion is a chemical fact. Since it is a fact, it has no opinion or action on ideas.)    We have no real purpose, were just accidents. So now its survival of the fittest.     (That is a crude oversimplification and misinterpretation of evolutionary theory, which I will point out is not the same as evolution itself. The most suited to survive and reproduce might be the best co-operators, the religious, the most competitive, the  biggest, the smallest or have any other trait that is favourable at any time.  Evolution also applies to populations, not so much to individuals, and has no direction,)    When you think about it, these are the ideas behind terrible things like Nazism.      (Hitler was a creationist, read Mein Kampf, it is somewhere in the early chapters.  The Nazi ideal was "racial purity" which is an anti-evolutionary idea since it reduces variety.  If they could distort any ideas to suit their program they did.  Just like any politicians twisting facts to suit themselves.  Also see Godwin's Law. First one to mention the Nazis or Hitler loses the argument.)     The Nazis perceived disabled people as being worthless drains on society, so they killed them under agonizing conditions.     (Are you sure the conditions were agonising?  Most of the murders of the mentally ill and disabled were done with carbon monoxide which is colourless, tasteless and produces unconscionsness followed by death. Not that I am defending the Nazis, but get your facts straight.)     Evolution also supports sterilization, when the government sterilized people because they were not considered worthy of reproducing.  Evolution also makes abortion okay, and abortion is victimizing the weakest members of society.      No it does not, it is a biological fact and cannot express an opinion.

Evolution supposes racial superiority.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	"I suppose most of you accept Social Darwinism"    When you assume, you make an '@ss' out of 'u' and 'me'.    Natural selection has nothing to do with social Darwinism.  Accepting the theory of gravity doesn't make you want to shove people off of cliffs, does it?    On a social level, I believe that all humans are equal in worth, and that includes your younger brother.  It also includes the 15-year-old wheelchair-bound daughter of my friend, and the mentally challenged kid who lives across the street from me, and my friend's brother who, like yours, suffers from autism (you're not the only person who has experience with the disabled, dear) -- all of whom I care dearly for, would never harm for any reason and would protect fiercely from any kind of social "cleansing" program.  Having compassion for others is, in fact, an evolutionary trait brought about by natural selection -- if we protect our own kind, our species becomes larger in numbers.  Evolution has nothing to do with sterilizing what you call the "weaker members of society", as it's a natural process, not a social one.    Everything you've written is highly offensive to all people who accept evolution, as you have basically made the assumption that we're cold, sociopathic monsters, which just isn't true.  Stop spreading this kind of BS about us... it's ridiculous.  Not only have you assumed that we believe all that crap you've written, you also have the nerve to start trying to teach us moral lessons that we already know.

"When you think about it, these are the ideas behind terrible things like Nazism." - If that was the case, Hitler wouldn't have banned Darwin's work.

I would not presume to have the arrogance to think I know the origins of everything. That is unfathomable and not worth my time.

You do not have any actual knowledge of the Theory of Evolution but instead have wholeheartedly drank the Ben Stein propaganda Kool-Aid called "Expelled".  Mr. Stein completely misinterprets the term "survival of the fittest" to suit his and his keepers religio-political agenda. Social Darwinism has nothing to do with evolution, which is simply the change in allele frequencies in a population over time.    Perhaps some basic courses in physical science and biology at your local community college would clear up your misunderstanding and/or misinterpretation of the science behind biological evolution.  Real science is not a popularity contest or democratic process, nor does it say anything regarding religious belief.  It is simply a study of the evidence presented by the natural world, of which biological evolution has in abundance.    Evolution is a fact of nature, the Theory of Evolution is simply the scientific examination of those facts.

The first time I watched it was with my mom and it felt kinda uncomfortable at first because we really don't talk about me being gay anymore, we just keep to ourselves on the subject.

AA10823062	"Alchemist" is the root word of "chemist" and basically that is all they were -- chemists. Many scientists had figured out the basic concept behind the Periodic Table --that different atoms have different structures. So, they figured (very logically) that if you could change atomic structure you could basically change one thing into another. Say, for instance, if you could change the atomic structure of lead, you could turn it into gold. We know now, that, in fact, the alchemists were right. It can be done. However, the amount of energy and expense is so great that it is pointless. It costs more to convert lead into gold than simply to buy gold.<br>  <br>  The "powers" of the alchemists were, however, useful in other ways. Developments in chemistry have helped us create many medicines that have saved millions of lives over the years. Most people prefer being alive to being dead and they will pay give you as much gold as you want for the medicine that keeps them alive.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	Alchemists are basically scientists, more specifically chemists.

4crqyM2laa	Baptism is a public showing of your belief in Chirst.  You are symbolicly cleansing yourself spiritually and showing the world you believe Christ died for your sins.  Kind of neat when you think about it.  You are doing what God did, when John the Bapist baptised God in the river Jordan.  It was a cleansing of his human soul of your sin that he had taken onto his shoulders.  Baptism must be done voluntarily as and adult.  If you were baptized as a young child just after birth, then that Baptism was a public showing that your parents were going to raise you Christian.

That's why separation of church and state is so vitally important. It keeps our government from turning into a theocracy, and hence alienating all other groups that don't believe in that particular religious philosophy.|`|mcbCXWJaaa	I'm an atheist and I'm tolerant of freedom of religion.

Every man will prove himself out whether Christian or not.  This is the verdict, every man will hear the voice of Jesus Christ while alive or dead.  Those who hear His voice are His sheep while the remainder are as goats, stubborn and blind.  All are without excuse.   No matter who, when, how or where you are or of any peculiar circumstance all will be afforded the oppurtunity to either accept Jesus Christ or reject Him.    John 5:24  "I(Jesus speaking) tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. 25I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. 26For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. 27And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.  28"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice 29and come outthose who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. 30By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.    John 10:14  "I(Jesus speaking) am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me 15just as the Father knows me and I know the Fatherand I lay down my life for the sheep. 16I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also.

A- They will be reborn and reborn again and again until they become enlightened (attaining the Nirvana). This is the true nature of human race before Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism or any other religions were born. There are countless rebirths (thousands of them) prior to the current life.     In Buddhism, we believe a human being consists of Body (Rupa) and Mind (Nama). When one dies on this earth, which is one of the 11 Sense-Spheres -- heaven, ghost, and hell are in different spheres-- the body will decay and the last mind in this sphere will vanish. The new mind will immediately arise in the new body and in the new sphere.     The type of rebirth is conditioned by the karmas. The accumulated good and bad deeds will determine the state of the next being. Meritorious acts mean rebirth into a higher station, such as a superior human or a godlike being (deva), while evil acts result in rebirth as a human being in less desirable circumstances, asura, ghost, animal, or naraka (a being in hell). Only good deeds accumulating from previous lives and in this life will get you into heaven, but Nirvana (Nibbana) is the ultimate goal in Buddhism.

xLKPKgZXaa	Some people take 'the rod' literally, meaning that we should physically punish children. Others take it to mean that children must be disciplined. We only have to look around us to see what it is like in a world with a great many undisciplined children and their parents who were also never disciplined.     We have to choose for ourselves what form discipline should take (in conjunction with the laws where we live) but children should be punished for bad behaviour. If they are not we all reap the results of that indiscipline.|`|3c0c8be5fca466eb221bf1bf02ddc784aa	If you saw the school bully being punished by a teacher, would you object?

That is not to say that using physical punishment is the best thing.  However, there ARE situations in which it can be the ONLY thing that works.  Asimov wrote (probably quoting someone else), "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."  When a parent literally exhausts all options other than physical punishment, they MUST be willing resort even to that **for the sake of their child.** - not for their own convenience.    I remember my infant nephew pulling at the Christmas tree decorations.  Once he very nearly succeeded in pulling the entire tree over onto himself.  My sister slapped his wrist to halt him during his next attempt.  And the next.  As a result, he survived Christmas without a trip to the hospital.

I'm not sure what you are getting at, but I have never understood why some people think that corporal punishment equals "abuse".    Any form of discipline can be abusive if it is excessive, or arbitrary, not just corporal punishment.    I was spanked as a child, both by my parents and my teachers (the last spanking I got was from my 8th grade history teacher) and I turned out just fine. According to National Public Radio (NPR), 70 percent of all adults say the same thing: they were spanked as a child and they turned out just fine -- we are not violent, nor abusive, nor do we lack self-esteem, just because we were spanked as children.    Why do some people insist that spanking is bad for children, except for the reason that it has religious overtones? I think that people who are against spanking base their position on the fact that they also think that religion itself is wrong, so they oppose anything that might have religious undertones. There is no real evidence that any form of discipline is bad for children if it is done consistently, fairly and proportionately.    On the other hand, it is clear that a complete lack of discipline is bad for children, as they need to learn the idea that actions have consequences.|`|7cLYgf2raa	The bible is clear that beating children is what is needed. We see the results of not spanking kids. Ridilin, and out of control kids.

AA11923447	Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, which is a 40-day period marked by penance and spiritual reflection. Not all Christians observe Lent or Ash Wednesday, but many do. On Ash Wednesday, a cross is traced on the forehead; the ashes come from burned palm leaves from the previous Palm Sunday. It is a reminder that human beings come from dust, and will return to dust. It is a sign of penance, and a reminder of our mortality. Many people fast on Ash Wednesday. Lent is a memorial of Christ's 40-day temptation in the wilderness.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Ash Wednesday is the start of Lent, in preparation for Easter, it's not Catholic as most protestant churches also celebrate or observe it - many Catholics observe with a service but so do most other churches as well.   The ashes symbolize death, sorrow, loss - sin and during Lent you consider your sins and what God has given in the form of Christ to save you from your sins (his life in sacrifice).   It is days full of contemplation in preparation of the death of Christ and the supreme sacrifice that we do not have to make, often you are asked to give up something you enjoy, a carnal pleasure, such as coffee, soda, meat, chocolate... something of this world that is tangible, during this time as well to aid in the contemplation.<br>  <br>  In general it's an invitation to be humble.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Recovery after Mardi Gras :)<br>  <br>  Catholics get ashes on their forehead as a reminder that our bodies are just matter, and eventually we will die.

Ashes were used in ancient times, according to the Bible, to express mourning. Dusting oneself with ashes was the penitent's way of expressing sorrow for sins and faults. An ancient example of one expressing one's penitence is found in Job 42:3-6. Job says to God: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." (vv. 5-6, KJV) Other examples are found in several other books of the Bible including, Numbers 19:9, 19:17, Jonah 3:6, Matthew 11:21, and Luke 10:13, and Hebrews 9:13.<br>  <br>  However, some Adventists who do not celebrate Ash Wednesday say that the practice is not consistent with Scripture and is of pagan origin.[13] They usually cite Matthew 6:16–18, where Jesus gave prescriptions for fasting: "And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (NRSV) These groups argue that Jesus warned against fasting to gain favor from other people and that he also warned his followers that they should fast in private, not letting others know they were fasting. For these reasons, some Christian denominations do not endorse the practice. Others, however, point out that this very passage from Matthew is the one, not coincidentally, that is appointed by the Revised Common Lectionary to be read on Ash Wednesday. They might also clarify that the ashen Cross on the forehead does not represent the fast, but the mortal (fallen) condition of human existence. And they would refer to Jesus' words whereby he expected people to repent using sackcloth and ashes: "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes." (Luke 10:13; see also Matthew 11:21)<br>  <br>  <br>  Palm ash is used as when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey for Passover, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah, palm leaves were hailed at him and put below his feet to welcome him.<br>  So therefore signifying that Jesus' grace has saved our mortal souls.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Ash Wednesday is the beginning of Lent. A time of sacrifice and repentance. Catholics are supposed to "give up something" for the period of lent ending on Easter Sunday. But it has  to be something they are really sacrificing and not just some token. The ashes symbolize that they are starting their Lenten sacrifice.<br>  btw Easter is on the first Sunday  following the first full moon of spring.<br>  And just a note Alright, blue eyed girl! Well written!|`|kEWknILEaa	The Catholics observe 40 days of Lent prior to Easter.  Mardis Gras (French for "Fat Tuesday") is the last day before Ash Wednesday.  Mardis Gras is basically a tradition of excess prior to the religious exercise of discipline, forsaking something for 40 days between Mardis Gras and Good Friday .  A lot of Catholics give up red meat for Lent.<br>  <br>  The ashes are a symbol of repentance, since Christ's death was supposedly necessitated by our sins, and this is all related to Jesus Crucifixion (supposedly on Good Friday) and Resurrection (Easter Sunday, of course.)|`|py57svUyaa	Ash Wednesday marks the 40 lent leading to Easter in Catholic tradition.

True, it is not mandated in the Bible, but the use of ashes to symbolize penitence is thoroughly biblical. (See Job 42:6 for example.) <br>  <br>   It is entirely voluntary.  If you don't want to take part, don't knock those who find it helpful.<br>  <br>  As others have said,  it marks the beginning of the 40 days of Lent, which is a period for self-examination, repentence and self-discipline for many Christians.  It commemorates Jesus's 40 days temptation in the wilderness before he began his public ministry.<br>  <br>  Having gone through a time of serious spiritual preparation, the believer is ready to celebrate the joyful feast of the Resurrection at Easter.  You could regard Lent as spiritual spring cleaning.<br>  <br>  Receiving the sign of the cross in ash on the forehead symbolises humility and repentance.  It is also a reminder of one's mortality.<br>  In many churches the priest or minister says, "Remember that you are dust.  Dust you are and to dust you will return.  Turn from your sins [i.e. repent] and be faithful to Christ," as they make the sign of the cross in ash.<br>  <br>  As for those who say we should not adveritse when we are fasting, some people will wipe off the ash before leaving church, so as not to cause comments from outsiders.  Others will leave the ash in place all day as a reminder to themselves of their intention to take the lenten discipline seriously.<br>  <br>  It's not just Roman Catholics who use ashes on Ash Wednesay.  Many Anglicans and Episcopalians also do this (but not all).  Some Protestant churches will also observe it for those who find the symbolism helpful - but most don't.<br>  <br>  But again to the Biblical conservatives - it is a thoroughly biblical practice - even if the amount of ash used is just a small token and not the handfuls of the stuff that were used in ancient times.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	In the Western Christian calendar, Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent and occurs forty-six days (forty days not counting Sundays) before Easter. It falls on a different date each year, because it is dependent on the date of Easter; it can occur as early as February 4 or as late as March 10.<br>  <br>  Ash Wednesday gets its name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of the faithful as a sign of repentance. The ashes used are gathered after the Palm Crosses from the previous year's Palm Sunday are burned. In the liturgical practice of some churches, the ashes are mixed with the Oil of the Catechumens (one of the sacred oils used to anoint those about to be baptized), though some churches use ordinary oil. This paste is used by the priest who presides at the service to make the sign of the cross, first upon his own forehead and then on each of those present who kneel before him at the altar rail. As he does so, he recites the words: "Remember (O man) that you are dust, and to dust you shall return."|`|XKzUsb7zaa	Its not biblical it is church tradition.  It is the wed before lent begins which is 40 days of a sacrifice we make for God most do meat but it can be Chocolate, always the day after (fat tuesday which is the last day to party)  Probably to symbolize repentance.  It is practiced by Catholics, Lutherans, and Methodists for sure, probably others as well, but not all Christian denominations do this. BTW if it is done right, the ashes come from the burnt palms from the palm sunday of the year before, and is mixed with anointing oil.|`|DDwecKakaa	It is yet another pagan ritual that the Catholics conformed to to try and convert more Pagans. Just like all hallows eve, day of the dead, Winter solstice (christmas), and many others. The church has abandon many of the traditions they started after they failed their purposes. Just another way the "church" tried to induct and control people.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	The liturgical use of ashes originated in the Old Testament times. Ashes symbolized mourning, mortality and penance. In the Book of Esther, Mordecai put on sackcloth and ashes when he heard of the decree of King Ahasuerus to kill all of the Jewish people in the Persian Empire (Esther 4:1). Job repented in sackcloth and ashes (Job 42:6). Prophesying the Babylonian captivity of Jerusalem, Daniel wrote, "I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes" (Daniel 9:3). <br>  Jesus  made reference to ashes, "If the miracles worked in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have reformed in sackcloth and ashes long ago" (Matthew 11:21). <br>  In the Middle Ages, the priest would bless the dying person with holy water, saying, "Remember that thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return." <br>  The Church adapted the use of ashes to mark the beginning of the penitential season of Lent, when we remember our mortality and mourn for our sins. In our present liturgy for Ash Wednesday, we use ashes made from the burned palm branches distributed on the Palm Sunday of the previous year. The priest blesses the ashes and imposes them on the foreheads of the faithful, making the sign of the cross and saying, "Remember, man you are dust and to dust you shall return," or "Turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gospel." As we begin this holy season of Lent in preparation for Easter, we must remember the significance of the ashes we have received: We mourn and do penance for our sins. We again convert our hearts to the Lord, who suffered, died, and rose for our salvation. We renew the promises made at our baptism, when we died to an old life and rose to a new life with Christ. Finally, mindful that the kingdom of this world passes away, we strive to live the kingdom of God now and look forward to its fulfillment in heaven.|`|myjB1nWGaa	Ash Wednesday is the beginning of Lent. During Lent; Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and many other Christians reflect on the suffering and sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ash Wednesday is a solemn observance that closes with the sign of the cross being made on the forehead and the words, "Remember you are dust, and to dust you shall return”. Catholics are Christians. I deeply resent anyone claiming that we are not Christians. We were first, along with our Eastern Brothers and Sisters. Roman Catholics do not adhere to the false doctrines of Sola Sriptura; scripture alone, or Sola Fide; faith alone. We believe that God speaks to us in the inerrant, inspired, written word of God, as well as through sacred tradition. In this way, we are similar to Judaism. Many Jewish observances are not written in the Torah, but serve the purpose of strengthening the faith of the Jewish people. Not everything about God is written down. He cannot be contained in books. He constantly reveals himself as we mature in faith. If we knew everything about God, heaven would be a boring place!

Some people hated him and that's why they killed him.|`|1rMw79dXaa	Ha ha ha! Just take a nice long look at the christian religion...That should be enough to answer this question!

You have set up a straw man.  You are bored, or worse.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Never heard that said.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	NOTE: I have never heard this statement outright,  but I do believe that in their heart.. they think something similar to this. <br>  <br>  Here's why I THINK they do...<br>  <br>  Because they need to get authority and legitamacy from somewhere. <br>  <br>  Think about it...<br>  <br>  IF the primary Non-Catholic doctrine is TRUE.. and that EVERYONE interprets the bible for themselves, and each person should seek with an open mind, and pray to the Holy Spirit to reveal,  the word of God to them.. then in practical application,  NO ONE has any authority to say WHAT is right and what is wrong. - Anotherwards, there is no infallible tie-breaker outside of the Catholic church.  When the broke away from the Catholic church,  they have no one to mediate and decide doctrinal issues. <br>  <br>  There is no way for ANY group to say their are following the correct doctrine.  <br>  Another wards if my Church says you must have faith and THEN do works to be saved,  but another church says you ONLY need Faith,  then the 2 can't resolve their differences, because no one is infallible, no one is wrong,  each of us got that interpretation from the holy spirit and from the bible. <br>  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, IF I can say that JESUS himself taught and believed what I believe,  THEN I have authority.  THEN I have some reason to say what I think is at least BETTER then yours.<br>  <br>  So Fundamentalists,  to justify their narrower interpretation, have to believe that Jesus believed and taught what they did to have any reason for their beliefs.. to have any reason to say "I'm right and you are wrong"<br>  So they kinda HAVE TO believe Jesus was the first Fundamentalist. <br>  <br>  I'm sure this is really no different then Anglicans thinking Jesus was the first Anglican, Lutheran thinking Jesus was the first Lutheran, etc. <br>  And in reality, when you get down to it,  I guess Catholics think Jesus was the first Catholic... in a way,  because they believe that Jesus taught the Apostles, gave authority to Peter, and Peter's sucessors became the Popes.  It is just that Lutherans, Anglicans, and Catholics don't say it that way exactly.

I just hope people eventually shed these beliefs through education and logical thinking.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	None of those things come remotely close to illegalizing religion (and all of them are so slanted as to be close to lies), nor is that ever likely in the US or Europe.  Belief in your particular god will inevitably fade, but by the same advance of reason that stopped people believing in Zeus, but not by force of law.<br>  <br>  Oh and unless technology advances incredibly from its current state, there is no way to detect let alone criminalize beliefs, only actions.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Maybe, but how could you enforce a law that prohibits believing something?  If that law ever is passed, it will be passed by one religion trying to subvert another.<br>  <br>  I don't know the source for most of your claims, so I can't really comment on all of them.  I can say that the backlash against the Prop 8 people has come from the fact that an outside religious group (the Mormons) came into California and put on an anti-gay propaganda campaign that helped lead to the removal of rights from some of California's citizens.  Surely you see why that would invite a backlash.<br>  <br>  Religion and state should be separate; and you would think the Mormons would be on board with that since they had their religious freedom infringed upon by anti-polygamy laws (which were largely championed by other churches - see my first point.)|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Never|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	First, there's a difference between belief and religion.  Religion is the public practice of faith.  Belief is the internal, privately held point of view.  Belief can no more be outlawed than lust or greed can.  Behavior stemming from said belief which tend to be against the public good can, however, be outlawed.<br>  <br>  Second, in all of the cases you sighted there was a potential for church/state conflict.  I would ask that you cite sources (credible, open source materials) for each claim.  <br>  <br>  Third, on the broader scale, welcome to the rest of the world.  My daughter was sent home from school once for refusing to take off her pentacle, although there are plenty of other students at school wearing crosses.  The reason that such strict no tolerance type rulings on church / state issues in recent years is that many Christians have used positions of power to interfere with the free and equal expression of religious belief by those of other faiths.  If you're going to prevent one faith from wearing the symbols of their faith or putting up the symbols of their holiday celebrations, then you have to exclude ALL faiths.  The rule of thumb is all or none.

The term cowabunga has the following meaning: <br>  <br>  an expression of surprise or amazement, often followed by "dude"<br>  <br>  Based on that definition to me, it means something spectular just happened, and from what I remember I think of the cartoon, Ninja Turtles.  They made this phrase popular in that time frame.  Anyway, the term itself is used when someone does something surprising or exciting.  I don't use this term nor have I ever used it, but it is something that obviously was made up by someone who was creative.

I'm a teenager and for me, it just bothers me that so many of my peers think they are above following rules/laws. Its reckless disregard for what is expected of them. And a lot of people have been personally affected by drinking/smoking. Relationships and families are damaged so often by addiction. Drinking/smoking can take over a person's life easily and it turns them into someone else. It can do even worse when a loved one is killed by a car crash involving alcohol or by cancer caused by years of smoking. Everyone has their reasons I guess.

U24VtSlZaa	"Age" is a concept rooted in linear time, which is how we experience time on Earth.  But in terms of the hereafter, time is more like a fourth dimension -- everything that has ever happened is always happening and will always be happening.    [note to emfederin:  you can call time the fourth dimension if you want to, but in reality it's more like a tapeworm.  If I didn't make myself a genius, who would?]|`|TzY9vkinaa	They'll be in their perfect state, so if a 13 year old body is their perfect state then yes. Personally I think we'll all have adult bodies, but thats just my opinion.|`|AA11058044	Considering the infant mortality rate for most of human history, it apparently means that heaven will be FILLED with billions of crying babies - apparently including many that were aborted before coming to term.    That sure doesn't sound like heaven to me.    The alternative is that personal development, growth and learning are possible in the after-life.    In which case, allowing your child to suffer the indignities, pain, suffering, hardship and deprivation of the "real" world - where we have no evidence that God or Heaven even exists - could be thought of as cruel and even evil - denying them a place with God.    Also, it would mean that the unbelievers and sinners who didn't repent in life would have a chance to do so in the afterlife.      So if you believe that personal growth is possible in the after-life, it would be cruel and evil to allow your child to grow up in this world.  It would be akin to deliberately raising your child on diseased tissue scavenged from the toxic waste dump you're living in that's in the middle of a war zone.  It would almost be a sin not to kill your child at birth.    It also makes worshipping God in this life irrelevant, since if you do not, that "error" can be easily remedied once you are in Heaven and actually have evidence that He exists.    So either Heaven is populated with billions of children who will never grow up, or all parents will go to Hell for not killing their children and sending them to Heaven.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	if there is a heaven i dont think it would work like that|`|iNi2G6UWaa	I suggest you ask your God this question.|`|PdBmOPI2aa	Personally, I think that in heaven, everyone is ageless.

Time IS the fourth dimension.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	My own impression of a persons soul is much more than simply an image resembling the physical body. Try to think beyond that. Perhaps in heaven we exist purely as energy, able to travel wherever we like just by thinking about it. It's about what you feel inside rather than what you see.  I've also been told by those who claim to have astrally projected beyond their physical body, that our astral self remains as it did at our physical peak, that 'perfect state', so an old person might look like they did in their early 20's. So they claim anyway.|`|hnhb119Laa	How about those first trimester fetuses, no more than a small glob of unintelligent cells?  What's heaven like for them?|`|JBkB1ZLJaa	We are the age we believe we are.  In this 3 dimensions world our 5 senses influence our judgment making us believe about time and years of age.  In reality there is no time. Only NOW exist.     For example when we say: "yesterday I went to play hockey with my friends..." In reality it is right now that I am playing with my friends (in my Imagination). In general we don't believe this fact,for it is not visible or touchable. We just discard it. Some might like to believe it but down deep they don't assimilate it completely.    When a person dies, he is in the same state of mind as he was when he was in his bed sleeping or when he was (like the expression says "in space"). He does doesn't know that he is dead. Just like us as we fall asleep we don't suddenly realize this fact.  So while dreaming it possible to imagine our self at any age.  In this 3 dim. world we are influenced by our environment so time passes and years as we know it add up.      If a 13 years old person get influenced mentally and believes he is living in this body and that body ages than he will feel the effects. This will be an illusion just like us here on earth.    The body we wear is only a form of expression. The spirits needs a body to express its thoughts.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	No.    Heaven doesn't really exist - it was made up to entice believers, just like hell was made up to scare them.    Glad I could clear that up for you.    Oh, and what about the 20% (at least) of pregnancies that end in a few hours, without the mother even knowing? will heaven have a lot of people consisting of a handful of cells?|`|LjsRfaskaa	No they lose the ego part and discover they are made of pure light... the same as every other soul.

It requires  food and liquid and it needs to get rid of the dross.  It also  begs attention and love and kindness and a sexual outlet.    If it does not get all these things, it becomes warped.  If you  try to avoid or refuse all these natural urges you will find that they  try to take over and become very strong addictions which you  must deal with and maybe need to find help for.    Guilt is a totally useless emotion.
qWu5F1O2aa	I dont think we have "lost" respect because if you really think about it, we have no "set" culture to begin with. Our country was founded on different kinds of immigrants so it is obvious we have adopted a lot from each of these cultures.  I cannot speak for every "white american" but i love learning from others. I dont forget about my dutch culture but since when is it wrong to take interest in another?

He should have not told you anything if he didn't want anyone else to know.  In fact he should have not done "it" in the first place.    You already apologized so don't feel any guilt regarding this.  It is up to him to accept or reject your apology.  You should concentrate on yourself, not him, because you are grieving aswell.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I believe it's a test of your beliefs and power of perception.

Prior to being born, you with the help of  some kindly advanced souls, put together a script of what you wanted to accomplish in this life.  Some things you knew would be difficult  but you chose them to help you grow.  That is cause and effect in  action.  Whenever you blame God, you are copping out.  You chose it  because you have the power to handle it, to cope, to overcome  and to grow as a result.

I really think people have a right to believe whatever seems reasonable and believable to them.  That's a right everyone should have.  I respect their beliefs and I expect the same respect in return.  So long as they don't believe their beliefs are the only 'true' ones, or that their beliefs entitle them to special rights and privileges, I respect whatever they believe.    I love the Bible, just on the level of literature.  I don't believe it is 'holy', or written by, or inspired by God, it's just a fascinating collection of ancient writings that is interesting on several levels.    But to insist that it is true, word for word, to be interpreted literally, I think that shows a shocking lack of imagination.  Some stories, like Genesis, seem to cry out to be taken allegorically.  They make much more sense that way.  Other stories seem to be legendary.  Others are symbolic.  I think it just requires a certain amount of self-deception to believe it was all meant to be taken literally.  But that's just me.

I currently support an engineering center where the majority of the employees have masters and doctors degrees, and the majority of them are Christians.      Some of the most brilliant minds in history have been Christians, such as Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and Blaise Pascal.  Look at the writings of men like CS Lewis and TS Elliott, both brilliant minds.  The music of JS Bach, a devout Christian and church leader.  Francis Bacon, who established the modern day "scientific method".  Inventors like Alexander Graham Bell, Henry Ford, James Watt. George Washington Carver and Thomas Edison.

hYQTOabRaa	The original purpose of life is stated in Genesis 1:28 "Further God blessed them and God said to them: "Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth.""  Our original purpose was to live happy fulfilling lives in a perfect paradise earth for eternity, just enough time to reach our unimaginable full potential.<br>  <br>  What happened to that purpose?<br>  <br>  A certain son of god, an angel in heaven, looked at everything God had created and desired to have it for himself and enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather then obey God.  Thus by his course of action he made hinself Satan, which means adversary.<br>  Why did God not destroy Satan promptly after he rebelled?<br>  Serious issues were raised by Satan: <br>  (1) The righteousness and rightfulness of Jehovah's sovereignty.<br>  Was Jehovah withholding from mankind freedom that woould contribute to their happiness?<br>  Were mankind's ability to govern their affairs successfully and their continued life truly dependent on their obedience to God? <br>  Had Jehovah been dishonest in giving a law that stated that disobedience would lead to their death? <br>  (Genesis 2:16, 17; 3:3-5)<br>  So did Jehovah have the right to rule?<br>  (2) The integrity of intelligent creatures toward Jehovah.<br>  By deflection of Adam and Eve the question was raised:<br>  Did Jehovah's servants obey him out of love or might ALL of them abandon God and follow the lead given by Satan?<br>  This latter issue was further developed by Satan in the days of job. (Genesis 3:6; Job 1:8-11; 2:3-5; see also Luke 22:31)<br>  These issues could not be settled by merely executing the rebels.<br>       Consider human rulers in history who executed those who questioned their rule, i.e. Saddam Husain, Adolf Hitler, etc, were they respected?<br>  <br>  Not that God needed to prove anything to Himself.  But so that these issues would never again disrupt the peace and well-being of the universe, Jehovah has allowed ample time for them to be settled beyond a doubt.  That Adam and Eve died following disobeince to God became evident in due time. (Genesis 5:5)  But more was at issue.  So, God has permitted both Satan and humans to try every form af government of their own making.  None have brought lasting happiness.  God has let mankind go to the limit in pursuing ways of life that ignore His righteous standards.  The fruitage speaks for itself.  As the bible truthfully says: "It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step." (Jeremiah 10:23)  At the same time God has given His servants oppurtunity to prove their loyalty to Him by their acts of loving obedience, and this in the face of enticements and persecution instigated by Satan.  Jehovah exhorts His servants, saying: "Be wise my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me." (Proverbs 27:11)  Those proving faithful reap great benefits now and have the prospect of eternal life in perfection.  They will use such life in doing the will of Jehovah, whose personality and ways they truly love.<br>  <br>  So did God's original purpose change?<br>  <br>  According to Revelation 21:3&4: "With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: "Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them.  And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be now more and neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. the former thigs have passed away.""  And Psalms 37:10,11&29 says, " And just a little while longer and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place and whe will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth. And they will indeed find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forevr upon it."<br>  <br>  It remains God's purpose for the earth to be filled with a perfect, happy race of mankind who love him as their father and are willing to obey his voice knowing he has their best interests in mind with his comands.<br>  <br>  In the meantime we do live in this ugly world that Timothy described as "the last days, critical times hard to deal with. . .When men would be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, hving no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, loversof pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away." (2 Timothy 3:1-5)  As long as this world continues the way it is our purpose in life, as disciples of Jesus Christ, to fulfill the commission he gave us to "Go therefore and make disciples of of people of all the nations. . . "  This commission is e|`|D9lMg7A2aa	How about helping ? What a crazy concept.|`|atfKCzmPaa	So how can we find out the purpose of life? Well, why not ask God, “the source of life”? (Psalm 36:9) How can you do that? Happily, he has spoken to us through the Bible. He has had individuals of faith write down his thoughts in a way that we can understand. Actually, the purpose of life can be expressed in just a few words: We are here to learn about God and to do his will. The Bible says: “The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man.”—Ecclesiastes 12:13. Does that seem too simple? <br>  God’s Original Purpose--Learning what God originally intended for mankind will help you better understand the purpose of life. The Bible account of man’s creation says: “God went on to say: ‘Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.’” (Genesis 1:26) Thus, humans were made with the potential for being like God, possessing the outstanding qualities he has, including wisdom, power, and love. Is it surprising, then, that some find it fulfilling to seek new knowledge or to engage in activities that challenge their mental or physical powers? And is it unexpected that helping others provides a satisfying purpose in the lives of many? This is, in part, what we were created to do. The Bible record goes on to say that humans were given oversight of all other life on earth—“the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:26) No wonder, therefore, that even today many find satisfaction in having animals around and in playing with them. Humans were also commanded to ‘subdue the earth.’ (Genesis 1:28) What did this imply? Certainly not that people should selfishly and irresponsibly exploit the earth until its riches were exhausted, its atmosphere polluted, and its seas and land areas strewed with garbage. Rather, God set the pattern for subduing the earth when he “planted a garden in Eden, toward the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.” (Genesis 2:8) This garden of Eden was the model showing what the earth would become. It reflected God’s purpose for our planet. The Bible account explains: “Further, God blessed [the first man and woman] and God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it.’” (Genesis 1:28) God wanted humans to have children and populate the earth. He brought the first man and woman together and, in effect, performed the very first wedding. (Genesis 2:22-24) No wonder that marriage and family add meaning and purpose to the lives of so many!<br>  What Life Could Have Been--As we study the Bible, it is evident that God intended for Adam’s family to grow and for him and his children to extend the boundaries of the garden of Eden until humans filled the entire earth. And the subdued earth would be a paradise. True, man would use the riches of the earth for his own benefit. But this would be done in a responsible way. Man was to be a steward of the earth, not a despoiler of it. The destruction of the earth that we witness today is against God’s will, and those who share in it are going contrary to the purpose of life.—Revelation 11:18. We learn something else from the early Bible record, and that is that it was not God’s purpose for people to die. Our first parents died only because they disobeyed God. (Genesis 2:16,?17) When they disobeyed, they were no longer fulfilling the purpose of life—they were no longer doing God’s will. So not only did they die but all their offspring have also been subjected to death because of inheriting imperfection from them. (Romans 5:12) Humans were, however, originally intended to live forever, not to die. This is likely why many find it frustrating to contemplate the cutting short of their life’s work by death.<br>  Fulfilling God’s Purpose--God’s original purpose for humankind and this earth has not changed. He still intends to have a paradise earth peopled by a perfect human race. Yet, he has had to make arrangements to overcome the sad effects of the failure of our first parents. Doing God’s will today involves acting in harmony with all these arrangements of God. We read in the first book of the Bible that God spoke of a “seed” who would come to undo all the harm wreaked by Adam and Eve’s failure to do His will. (Genesis 3:15) In the Christian Greek Scriptures (“New Testament”), we read of the appearance of Jesus Christ as that “seed,” of his sinless life, and of his death at the hands of his enemies. Jesus’ death was, effectively, a sacrifice in our behalf, opening the way for us to regain the eternal life that Adam and Eve lost. (Hebrews 7:26; 9:28) Yes, the Bible says: “Everyone exercising faith in him [will] not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”—John 3:16. And there is more. After his death, Jesus was resurrected as an immortal spirit creature and is now ruling as King of God’s heavenly Kingdom. Soon that Kingdom will act to replace the present ear|`|sOeDTrPeaa	It's the instinct to continue on the human species and to survive. the meaning of life is 42.|`|QSMotfDUaa	you give your self meaning|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	Life is only what you make of it with what you are provided.|`|MTuUZBzIaa	there is no point beyond what you make for yourself|`|RSUYs8Mzaa	To paraphrase Gandhi, you must not lose faith in humanity.

The missionaries tried in vain to convert me and I "pretended" to be interested, just to see what they were all about. <br>   <br>  They interview you and record it "on videotape" and send it off to the main branch in Salt Lake City (probably so they can do some weirdo mumbo jumbo voodoo shi@@ on those who leave the church!) <br>  <br>  Not to mention they have a pentagram on their "temples" and their services, according to my ex-boyfriend, are "pagan". They dress up in costumes and mock the Creation and some even said they have sex in the aisles! Gross! But one thing I know for sure is that they dress you in a white garment and touch you in certain places as they pray over you (hence, probably molest you). <br>  <br>  They also have certain "rules" that you must be a full tithing member before you can attend "the temple". And my ex-boyfriend said that there's a threat of death if anyone says what takes place in the temple rites. Creepy! <br>  <br>  And their church services go like this: Person after person comes up to the podium and says "I know this church is true, I know this church is true". And they say this shi@@ over and over and over again and their church service is for THREE HOURS every Sunday. You miss just ONE church meeting, they act like you have committed capital murder or something! (Not to mention they have 2-3 other "meetings" during the week that they require you to attend. Yuck!) <br>  <br>  Anyways, I decided to break up with my boyfriend AND leave the church and he and I got in a big-a@@ fight about it! I raised my voice at him in defiance and told him "what is all this Joseph Smith crap you guys talk about all the time? What about Jesus? Shouldn't it be about Jesus? Shouldn't Jesus be the CENTERPIECE of any true Christian church services today?" to which he raised his voice at me and replied "Satan has infiltrated our church, okay?" as IF I was supposed to somehow "be okay" with that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  And that's when I told him it was over, that I was leaving the church and GOOD RIDDANCE! And that church tried to call me and stop by my doorstep REPEATEDLY for several months on end, calling, stopping by, calling, stopping by, trying to "harrass me" into coming back. So I finally called them up and told them off and they haven't bothered me since. Just goes to show ya. <br>  <br>  Oh and they lie, BIG TIME. He told me that "pay le ale" meant "oh God, hear the words of my mouth" but what it REALLY means is "hail Lucifer! Marvelous false God!" Another thing they frequently lie about is their believe that Adam became a God and that hence, all men become Gods after death (and hence, that was Satan's first lie in the Garden of Eden, as you'll remember, I'm sure). And not only that but he claimed to ME that they instituted polygamy to help civil war widows "be taken care of", back in the day. What crock! Joseph Smith's "buddy" suggested for him to "have a revelation from God" concerning plural marriage.<br>  <br>  Oh and one last thing. My ex ACTUALLY ADMITTED TO ME that they consider Joseph Smith just AS important IF NOT MORE important than JESUS! Can you BELIEVE IT? Personally, I'd say that Joseph Smith IS their "Jesus", if you will.<br>  <br>  And yeah, those Mormons are trying to recruit people like mad out there, attempting to damn as many souls as possible! Especially Native American ones! (Which is really interesting -- considering most recently, I've found many parallels in Aztec religion and Christianity -- so maybe that just goes to show ya that the Natives are part of God's people, too -- no wonder the Mormons are trying to recruit them so bad!)<br>  <br>  Ofcourse, I'm not talking about the FDLS church or whatever. I'm talking about the LDS church (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints). They will SAY or PROCLAIM the name of Jesus to try to "hook you in", but then as you soon as you step foot inside their church services, Jesus is not heard of, BELIEVE ME, I KNOW!)|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Obedience is an important part of their belief system.

EBGdlo35aa	Well, theoretically at least, in can work in either direction.<br>  <br>  If you have faith in God, you can read the bible and conclude that the bible is the authentic account of God's relationship with man.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you can read and evaluate the bible, conclude that it is authentic, and because of that accept the existence of God.  This is the way it happened for me.<br>  <br>  Of course there are other possibilities that do not include the bible.  The first 300 years of Christianity was without a bible - and Christianity spread like wildfire during that period.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|macZI2dzaa	I have seriously and deeply studied the background, history and transmission of the Bible.  WF Albright, one of the greatest ancient Middle East archeologists of the 20th century, stated, "There is nothing but prejudice against the manuscripts of the Old and New Testament."  Of course now, there is quite a bit of prejudice against Albright.<br>  I need little faith in the Bible, the facts speak for themselves.  You should check it out.|`|RTaimrg7aa	My faith in both God and the bible are based on my observations and experences in life.  I have faith by what I have seen God do in my life and by what he currently is doing (Hebrews 11:1).

They base their guidance of how to worship god on the bible.  Religion is an attempt to organize spiritual teaching.  IMHO, unfortunately, the teaching has gone astray from the teacher.|`|AA10589243	To answer this question we will have to define some words in the question itself.<br>  <br>  Firstly , the word FAITH , in regard to the Bible means this ---<br>  Hebrews 11:1 .?.?.''Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld. ''<br>  <br>  You wouldn't say that 'I have faith in the Bible'.<br>  You can however say 'I have faith that the things written in the Bible is true'.<br>  <br>  It would be suitable to ask then ''Do you have confidence in what is written in the Bible.''<br>  <br>  <br>  Now the answer.<br>  <br>  People can be confident that the things written in the Bible are true because of a number of factors.<br>  <br>  Firstly  , its integral harmony.<br>  It is a book written down by many different men over a very long period of time , many of whom never met each other or read each others writings.<br>  It is harmonious in its overall purpose and teachings. , namely the vindication of Gods name and the restoration of mankind to perfection.<br>  <br>  Secondly are its prophecies.<br>  Thousands of accounts were written down in advance of happenings that hadn't yet occurred.<br>  There are a large number of prophecies relating to Jesus alone in the Bible written before he was even born.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thirdly - Scientific accuracies beyond mans thinking of the time.<br>  While not a scientific book the Bible does brush onto scientific and medical things from time to time.<br>  A long time long before the concept of microorganisms in dead bodies causing diseases was discovered , they Bible commanded Gods people to be clean in this respect.<br>  Thereby avoiding disease.<br>  The same goes for the disposal of human excrement.<br>  <br>  These were written thousands of years before modern science recommended such things.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fourthly - It also should not be forgotten about the physical writing itself and how it has endured.<br>  The Bible was written and copied meticulously down through time to avoid errors.<br>  Hitler tried to stamp out the Bible in Europe but failed.<br>  <br>  Again , no other book has been able to last so long , in a virtually unaltered condition.<br>  <br>  These things prove that the true God of the Bible -- Jehovah , did inspire the Bible , and it is something for all good people to take seriously.<br>  <br>  <br>  For more Bible based information please feel free to email me.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Your first supposition is incorrect. The original Christian Church bases its faith on the teaching of its founder, Jesus Christ.  It lived this faith for more than three centuries before it gathered some of its writings into a book and called it the Bible.  If the Church had never compiled the book, it would still have all of its doctrinal truths, all of its beliefs.  So, the faith of the Church is based on Christ, and the Bible reflects that faith but is not the source of it.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	What about "faith" is so difficult to understand?<br>  <br>  The very definition of faith is a belief that is not proven. I choose to believe in Christ, I choose to believe in the Bible, I have faith in God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blessings!

hKJIDdVqaa	God does not pretend He does not exist.  Unbelievers are just too prideful to see Him, or hear Him.  Blind, deaf, and hard of heart, blocks out the true light of God.  Blessed are thy who believe without seeing, for that is faith.|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	All theological experiences (or the lack of them) are personal and subjective.    For any of us that believe in a Creator, the facts point to a non-interventionist Creator otherwise it would be more active in making its presence known.|`|yHfsHp6naa	I don't think it's a pretense.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	God is clearly seen through His creation, so that none are without excuse.  God shows Himself to you through everything around you.  Another thing to consider is that even when people saw the miracles of Jesus, they didn't believe because they saw them, they attributed them to the devil!      Just because someone sees a miracle, does not mean that they will believe.|`|89MKzLl3aa	God is available and is here for everyone, and especially for the nonbelievers. God loves all His children, even the most wayward.    He is ready and wanting the faithless to accept Him, but He's not going to twist any ones arm.|`|8pQrIL90aa	God does not hide himself from man, but he does not hear the prayer of a sinful man either. You must first go through life and see just how utterly miserable you are with your life, and if you have any faith inside you, that faith God can use to draw you to his son, and then you begin your relationship with him through Jesus.    One can either come by their own free will, or many come after they have spent enough time in this world to see that its really not what it appears to be. It is a mystery to most because the wisdom of God far exceeds the mortal mind of men, therefore if God on that day of judgment deems you guilty and unworthy to come into his presence from all eternity, then it is better to think that he has tried to draw you in many ways before your death, and you did not respond. He loves you, and does not take pleasure in you dying in your sins.    The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance 2 Peter 3:9|`|URO3gDXcaa	because there is no god.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	what does not exist cannot pretend to be anything    Faith:  the willful belief in something for which there is no evidence or which has evidence against it|`|ulwXFrrJaa	It would have been so much easier to believe back in the days of talking donkeys and snakes.|`|AA12203324	Perhaps God has decided he likes non-believers better.|`|iX5p5pHwaa	theres no such thing as god|`|pV6K2mm5aa	2012 - there you go!|`|Run7dyraaa	If you are faithless, then you are not seeking Him.

You think He has separated because you are not with Him, on any level.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	The bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God...  Until you surrender to Him and come to him with a broken spirit, there is nothing that God can do for you...or will do for you...why should He ???|`|2f05f1797218d6d460cdf8e06af0c251aa	LOL, is that a real question?|`|9f7328923e8ee8bd543f1c4b68806f3faa	No pretending.

Which makes sense.|`|UD7d70awaa	If God just came down and said to everyone I'm here I exist, then there would be no reason for faith. Plus evn if he did that there still would be people that didn't believe.|`|TJrRPIFLaa	I always wondered that myself.  Why can't he stop hiding and just come have an effin' beer with us already?!!!!!|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Good question.  God does not want to be known by those that hate Him.  God does not want people to love Him out of compulsion because they have to because they see God floating around in the sky.  As it is we have a choice to love Him or not in His absence.      Luke 8:10  He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, " 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'|`|4EkyrRyNaa	Just for fun, try and put yourself in the shoes of a non-beliver.     From here It looks like God doesn't exist because there is no evidence so thats where many, including me, conclude there is no god    The only way god "proves" he exist to those with faith is because those with faith see things and relate them to god|`|7cLYgf2raa	Even when God walked among men most still did not believe he was real.And it is just a conscious decision to reject God and that will be held accountable.If you will not believe the written word, neither will you believe even if he tapped you on the shoulder and said, " here I am."Jesus proved that by men rejecting Him as he walked among them.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	because hesheit doesn't like those who use HeSheIt for their own base purposes.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	The absolute contrary is true . . . THEY are pretending HE is non-existant!    If they really believed He existed, as powerful as He is and clear in how He wants to be worshiped . . . they would change!     Believing a 75 MPH Mack truck won't kill you as you stand in front of it on a highway will not save your life . . . you have to move.

He is not hiding, just waiting for you to seek Him...|`|mcbCXWJaaa	Hm? What are you talking about? I never pretended like I did not exist to the faithless people.    lulz|`|JREs9K0Gaa	God has revealed the way to know he exists through salvation.  It's about finding God on God's terms instead of trying to find him on your own terms.  So many people insist that God does it on their terms only before they will believe in him.|`|AA10198840	You should turn that around.    God is not "pretending" like He does not exists, it's the faithless people who are pretending that He does not exists. The evidence of His existence is everywhere, in everything that does exist.    People are the ones who have separated themselves.    They do not want to acknowledge or accept the offenses they have done to other people and to God. Love requires repentance and forgiveness. How can you say you love someone, yet not be sorry for the wrongs you have done to them? If they love you, they will forgive you. Those who do not accept their responsibility and are not willing to be held accountable for their actions... and continue to offend others or God... they are the ones who are separating themselves. It is part of the consequences of their sins.    It's really not a hard concept to understand.    God will hold them accountable regardless of if they want to believe that He exists or not. If they go through life this way, they will bring nothing but hurt and heartache to themselves and others. It's just the simple consequence of not loving or caring... not even about themselves.

Due to the fact that your fiance was married to an unbaptized woman (and it matters not who married them), your fiance can due what is very valid but not well known (or practiced).<br>  <br>  The annulment process which you are familiar with is called an "External Forum". But there is something else; it is called an "Internal Forum". What is that? It is an option (again very little known and used) which is part of Canon Law. The Internal Forum solution (sometimes called "the good-conscience solution" )very simply, "Internal Forum" indicates that one must have a clear conscience about the divorce and that moving on with one's life, in good conscience, is the best decision for one's life.<br>  <br>  The reason I say this, is if for some strange reason your External forum you're currently in you can let your fiance in clear and absolute conscience (with the priests blessing of course) move forward with the wedding with the Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  The reason this is 'easy' is that the woman that he was legally married to was not baptized. That is the true kernel of the issue. This in and of itself allows that via the Pauline Priviledge that he is single and free to marry. This is that they were immediately unequally yoked and therefore could not enter into a Sacramental marriage. Period. If worse comes to worse--and the priest marrying (and not paperwork yet from Tribunal) have your fiance bring up the Pauline Privilege and that should ease the priest's heart and mind.<br>  <br>  Many blessings to you both!|`|MXgaNnpPaa	It took until 1993 to absolve Galileo of Heresy for declaring the Earth moved around the Sun.|`|xZet9Dunaa	It took me about that long to get mine.

I had to deal with it in childhood (was tormented by other kids because of the way I spoke and by how strange my last name was). Racism is a double-edged sword and definitely cuts both ways. The wounds to the victim never heal. Even when people go through psychological and/or psychiatric treatment, only so much can be dealt with. I also had a mental illness from childhood and have been tortured by others most of my life. I never recovered completely and will not in this life. The only reason I am still alive is because Jesus is with me.

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself.

No evil, no magic, just hard work and a search for whats real.  Everything you enjoy from light to electricity to air conditioning to planes cars energy drinks etc etc etc are all products of the scientific method. Your personal distaste for certain aspects of the world uncovered by the scientific method, has nothing to do with the validity of the method.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	I agree.    I consider Zeitgeist to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.    - Regarding part 1: Jesus    The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory.   It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?    Some other views:    " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the thesis as "effectively refuted"."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_...    For a point-by-point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...    For more rebuttals, see http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...      - Regarding Part II: 9/11    It should be noted upfront that being skeptical of the 'official version' of anything presented by the government or media, is a good thing for society. And it should also be noted that questioners of 9/11 'offical versions' range from genuine intellectual pursuits of greater truths, to bizarre interpretations specifically intended to support a unwavering point of view.     The Zeitgeist filmmaker is part of that spectrum that has bought into the theory that the government orchestrated the whole thing. Unfortunately the evidence they selected and presented was sloppy and much of it easily disproved, even by members of the Truth movement. (I've heard some speculate this may have been a red-herring to discredit the 'truth' movement).    For a point by point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...        - Regarding Part III: Men behind the curtain    As a liberatarian, I found this part to have had the most potential in exposing abuses of government and men in power. Instead, it trots out tired long disproven conspiracy theories.     "Income Tax law Doesn't exist" theory - Very stale. Consistently disproven over-and-over again. No new information, just new victims going to jail that fall for these arguments. Very sad.     "Federal Reserve System is owned by international bankers" - Still a common conspiracy theory. Still wrong. The Federal Reserve System, is headed by the Board of Governors, a Government Agency (look it up - http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind... ). The Federal Reserve branches can definitely be considered tightly regulated corporations owned by their member banks, all of which must be American-owned by law. It is receives regular audits, and is overseen by congress.     For a point-by-point analysis, check out:  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...    Other views:    "There is no shortage of information which refutes this viewpoint. But this type of conspiracy relies on two elements common to web surfers: First, they're only willing to check facts at the most superficial level, which usually means they'll read a message or watch a clip just once before forming an opinion and moving on. " Ref:   http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/s...    "...(a) common problem in the film: presenting something in such a shallow manner without further corroboration or scholarly evidence." - Ref:   http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12284    There are those who defend the film because they believe that agenda+motive is more important than truth. There is a certain irony here since the films overarching thesis is to be wary of those who would obfuscate the truth in an attempt to persuade others to their point of view.|`|eomrfXrzaa	Yeah, so?

We can see that most of these reasons can only be attributed to the process of critical thinking and intellectual reflection.    Eloquence of Qurans language  The uniqueness and beauty of Qurans text has been marveled by the best of Arab linguists and scholars from the days it was revealed until today. The more knowledgeable people are in the language, the more they appreciate the wonders of the textual fluency of the Quran.   Overwhelming scientific evidence and proofs  The Quran, revealed more than 1400 years ago has numerous scientific facts that are being validated by science only in this era.   Divine wisdom behind various social issues  The Quran provides a solution to numerous social issues, a deviation from which has known to cause societal chaos at all levels.   Arguments rooted in intellectual reasoning  Quran is the only known religious text that challenges mankind to think, reflect and ponder over the creation at large, social issues, Gods existence, and more. Quran in many instances challenges people to reflect and think on their own rather than heeding to the lose talk of those whose criticism is based on baseless foundations.   A confident assertion of a supreme being  Quran is the only known religious book that has a confident assertion of a supreme being on all issues ranging from the creation of the universe to social issues.   Divine Text  Qurans language and prose is very different from the language in the hadith (Porphets sayings) thus proving that Quran is not the imagination or words of Prophet Muhammad, as many doubters have alleged in the past and do so even today.   http://www.iqrasense.com/uncategorized/w...    this is what important     NBC NEWS:20000 americans Convert To ISLAM Each Year! :   http://www.youtube.com/watch/v/2PS2creVh...

We have had threats too and we live in UK!    6 million are leaving in Africa alone every year. Watch this http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVnILalpe...|`|EE9hxPXraa	This is the biggest lie that Muslims love to tell. The truth is that Islam is a religion in fast demise.      People in Islamic countries are poor and uneducated. Poor and uneducated people have higher birth rate. That is why the population is Islamic countries is growing faster than the population is civilized countries where birth control is in effect.      In the Western countries also Muslims are growing faster than other groups because they are escaping from the poverty of their countries of birth and are immigrating in the search of a better. Muslims growth is due to procreation and not conversion.        The following is taken from Friday Times, Lahore: On not so good news about British Pakistanis by Khaled Ahmed     "The figure of 700,000 [population of Pakistanis in UK] has grown from 5000 in 1951. Today, because of high birth-rate, fully 47 percent of them are under the age of 16, as compared to 17 percent for whites. They have the highest unemployment rate, five times more than the British average; and crime rate is higher among them than in any other community. Fully 2 percent of the prisoners rotting in British jails are Pakistanis, the highest for any one community."    The number of the people that are embracing Islam is minimal compared to the number of the born Muslims who are leaving Islam. Moreover, those who are enrolling in Islam are often undereducated, lower class people of the American Inner-cities. They are mostly blacks who are resentful of the whites and who see Islam as a sort of protest against the white man and his religion. On the other hand those who leave Islam are the Intellectuals and the educated class who cannot put up with the nonsense that is written in the Quran. However, those who leave Islam leave it silently. They are often concerned for their own safety. They know too well the criminal nature of Islam and the way it deals with the apostates. Therefore they do not announce their separation from Islam publicly. But those who embrace Islam are announced with trumpets.      See this article http://www.faithfreedom.org/oped/sina311...|`|JiaGiVexaa	Why don't you instead give us a link as to where you got this statistics from: "70% drop out in the first 3 years".

W46PN3eUaa	Using the definition "someone who lacks belief in a god or gods" for an atheist, then I'm an atheist.<br>  <br>  I'm not afraid of the end of the world because, however it comes, I won't be there for it. Or you could say that I am afraid of the end of the world, because for me it will end when I die (which would be true for anyone, religious or not, since once you are dead you are no longer part of the world regardless of whether you go to your heaven or not).<br>  <br>  If there is an end to the world predicted through atheism I would say that it would be whatever end is predicted by science. In this case astronomy and physics would be the most relevant sciences. With that in mind it would seem that the most likely end of the world will be billions of years from now (about 12 billion I think) when the sun expands/explodes. Of course that wouldn't necessarily mean the end of humanity, so it may not be all bad.|`|wwdllMzYaa	im a pagan atheist<br>  to me when the world ends it will eithe rbe a natural cycle , eveyrthing that lives, must die<br>  even the planets<br>  evne the universe<br>  or, we humans may destroy it with oneof the many things we have created for destriction<br>  <br>  how do i feel about that, am i afraid<br>  yes, in many ways i am<br>  andin others im not<br>  <br>  im afraid because the concept of eveyrthing dyign and not existing is very scary and huge to contemplate, <br>  you consdier is anything really worth it, really worth creating, doing, hearing, thinking, knowing  living etc etc<br>  but, as i said, i also acknowledge all taht lives, to must die<br>  so as hard as it is to consider, its a fact of life i try to accept<br>  <br>  your very welcome ;-)|`|URO3gDXcaa	no.  it will end in a few billion years and i will be long gone by then.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Because I am a Christian, I don't fear it.

Pxh93GHcaa	I am totally with you on this and would suggest that you should do every thing to protect your daughter. I am not making a general statement but your daughter has a very less chance to get adjusted with a Muslim guy. I have seen Muslims very closely and also seen their ideology. I won’t be surprise if tomorrow if he tries to put restriction on your daughter in some form. I can not really go more then this on public forum but I hope that you get my answer and I am sure you will do every thing to protect your family.|`|Oo1FI3Mkaa	I don't blame you for being concerned.  It is not a situation that I would want to be in.  But I can tell you this if it is of any value in knowing.<br>  <br>  We have a family friend (female) who is a catholic.  She married a muslim guy and they have been married for about 18 years now.  He has kept his religion and she has remained a catholic.  They had a son who is now in college.  I don't know what religion the son is but I do know that he does not follow muslim.  He goes back to his middle east country of birth about every two years and returns.  His wife or son have never accompanied him there, nor has he asked this of them.<br>  <br>  This man is a dedicated husband and a hard worker.  He is very personable and everyone who knows them seems to like him.<br>  <br>  I don't say that this would probably be the way it would be if your daughter were to marry her muslim boyfriend because it could be quite different.  But I just wanted to make you aware of that particular situation.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Lol I think your in the wrong section!<br>  If your a christian yourself and an active church member, you will know that by having two different faith's in a relationship isn't going to work in the long run. <br>  Each of their religions will need as much support as possible, how can that happen if they both believe different things. Does the lad believe in jesus? If not, how is your daughter going to be able to pray with him knowing he doesn't agree with what she's saying?<br>  A christian is supposed to marry another christian so they can grow in god together.<br>  Not much you can do though, she's old enough to make her own decisions<br>  <br>  P.S You can be a christian or can BE a christian, I have a friend who goes to church but isn't as involved as he should be....same goes with this.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	well Mom, It's only natural to be over-protective of our kids, and wish to spare them from any harm, so you're justified there. However only they two know how "serious" about things they are.. Maybe she's planning to convert, maybe HE is..you just never know..love can motivate people to do many "odd" things. In the end , I think it would be best to support her in whatever she is thinking and be there for her IF things end up in tears. Remember, if you don't ever let anything happen to them, then nothing will ever happen to them.

How would you feel if he tried to talk you out of your beliefs, or looked down on them?  Instead, a better approach might be to talk to him from a place of wanting to understand WHAT he believes and how he reached those conclusions.  And then respect your FRIEND for their choices in life.  So the answer to the second part of your question- you could talk to your friend in person, not these random sillies on Yahoo! Answers.|`|QF0F79sTaa	I have limited experience with this.  The problem with cults is that those who are members of them often only associate with other members, so what happens is there is never any dissenting opinions, there are no points of view presented to them other than the teachings of the particular cult, every interaction they have with other members only reinforces the hold that the cult has over the individual.    This is a powerful factor in continued membership, if at all possible try and continue your relationship with this person, but do not directly challenge the church, this will only serve to alienate them from you.  If at all possible you may be able to draw their attention away from the cult and help them maintain connections to someone who is not a believer, offer alternative opinions or just talk with them about things that are not related to the cult.    The important thing is to maintain this connection.  There may be a time in which intervention maybe possible, but this must be done at the right time and very delicately.

Russell was a genius to put it mildly and although I personally disagree with his major premises, that doesn't negate the value of his ideas.  Why I am not a Christian is still one of the great treatises in the area, although it has been dismantled rather effectively.  Russell definitely added to the debate and we are better for it.
AA10589243	The Bible clearly says that the life of an unborn person is just as valuable as a born person.    Exodus 21:22-23 ?And in case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. ?But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul--''    This is not something open to debate.      For more Bible based info please feel free to email me.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	There is sanctity of life. It is very important. Life is important for both old and young (counting unborn children). It is one of the laws not to murder, but then, Christianity is less about the rules than your relationship with God. The reason I wouldn't kill someone is because;    !. Their life is precious to God, and if they weren't Christians, I would be sending them to hell.    2. It is up to God to judge. If I killed that person I would be trying to be God. The decision is up to God.    Now I'm not saying, that we people are not allowed to make decisions about other people (like judges sentencing criminals) but that is different. There has to be laws, and rules, and that is what a judge follows.     And, speaking about abortion, even if I went through the horror and trauma of being raped, I would NEVER have an abortion. Apart from all the side effects it would have on me (proven, but hidden, facts), the child cannot help who his/her father is. He/she can't help that his/her father was a sick pervert and rapist. It's not fair to make the child pay for his/her father's crime. Woulkd you do that to a living baby?    To see a cool perspective, you should read the book "Unwound". It's not Christian, but a fictional novel about a place where they decide not to do abortion, but instead "unwind" children between ages of (I think) 13 and 18. It's really good as just a book, but also for perspective|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	Just like your hate of gays, you pick and choose things out of the old testament that you claim give you license to impose your beliefs on society, yet out of the other side of your mouth you rebuke god's condoning of slavery, eating shellfish, beating your wife, and all those other "inconvenient" things you wish to pretend aren't in the bible.|`|fQmJSlEyaa	it is wrong to kill unborn babies but it is ok to kill any one else strange believe system .

Any purpose one tries to associate with one's existence or the existence of the universe is just a vain attempt to delude oneself into believing that they are somehow more important than they really are.    That's what religion does. It makes people feel better about their lives, because deep down life has no purpose at all. Life just is.

Suffering is included in there. Sometimes you can't see what the purpose is, and sometimes you don't want to...but I believe it's always there. I used to date this man who was horrible. I mean really horrible. In hindsight I have no idea why I dated him, because he was everything I hated in a man. He was a drug addict, stupid, mean, STUPID, and just plain horrible. And then I met my husband, and realized something. Maybe dating that horrible man didn't have any purpose other than to make me realize how AMAZING my husband was.

I really like it when it warms up your back even though it's freezing cold outside. It makes me feel like someone is always there for me, even when I'm ready to give up. I don't know if you understand what I mean by that but the sun just puts me in a nice mood; makes everything all better.    I've clicked the Discover a few times but mostly there are garbage questions and answers not worth reading again. I like the best of answers though.

Can't be assed to look this up, but some vitamins ("water soluble") come out in your urine, so if your pee is really really dark, it's one of those.    Other vitamins stay in your body, I think. Fat soluble ones. I'm pretty sure those are harmless too.    Not that you should be PROUD of having the impulsive urge to pop pills.|`|qbb9YiRsaa	There is no definite side effects they can attribute to taking to much Vitamin C except maybe diarrhea.  Vitamin C is water soluble which means anything your body doesn't use goes out in your piss.  Its basically impossible to overdose for this reason.    What you should ask yourself is, why?  If you think you are addicted, you might be.  Why are you taking so much Vitamin C?  do you feel ill and think it might make you better?  Scientists haven't found any conclusive evidence to say large amounts of Vitamin C have any real health effects (good or otherwise).  This basically means, stop wasting your time overdoing it.  You are literally pissing your money away.    btw, how much are you taking?

8k9IdC3Maa	Hi there - have you ever heard of "TIME OUT" for bad behavior which is done at schools today with our children - that's very similar to the disfellowshipping or shunning written in the Bible for our benefit.  I've always wondered why is the TIME OUT policy acceptable at school with our children when it comes to discipling them for bad behavior.  I don't think I have ever seen an outcry from people for our schools practicing this policy and people calling our schools CULTS and what a terrible thing they are doing to our children - because parents, friends and family know it works for the benefit of the children and for all others at school if the children with bad behavior are put on TIME OUT  for awhile to reflect on their bad behavior and are returned hopefully learning their lesson and improve behavior and can go back and play with their friends - it's ONLY TEMPORARY - it's up to the disciplined person how long that time out will last - I could go on and on but I think you get the point - thanks for letting me give my 2 cents .... talk to your family about your health history ....|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Your Family made that decision Silencer. Hope everything is well with you Health-wise.    * BTW- I don't accept " Thumbs down " Silencer, Thank you.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	My feeling is that the practice of disfellowshipping to that degree needs to be challenged in a court of law. Good luck and I wish you the best.    But, if the JWs on here say that you can (by policy) still contact your family for vital information, then do it.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Oh my word does this mean that if you leave the JWs you are not allowed to contact any of your family who are still part of the group?  Wow, thats terrible.....sorry I cant answer your question I am just shocked that leaving has cut you off from your family!|`|RMMdGYCDaa	Both!  And that proves that JW is a CULT!!!!!|`|AA11328507	My favorite aunt is an Witness and her oldest daughter (my cousin) was "shunned" by the congregation.  They pretend my cousin is invisible and yet she still attends services.      My aunt did not shun her child and she is not in trouble for not shunning her child.  Your family can talk to you if they chose...but it looks like the cult wins this match.|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	there are certain situations where contact with a disfellowshipped family member is okay this is one of them......why don't you try calling your family instead of just assuming they won't talk to you about something like this.......|`|MnUjPdxIaa	Any religion that keeps a family apart is bogus, like totally dude.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	Yes it does..  that's so sad.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	contact isn't 'forbidden'    the family made the choice|`|O3WYA3WGaa	Ummmm, the disfellowshipping policy doesn't work like that. Call them and ask them about family history.|`|KM5MNRJmaa	contact with any disfellowshipped person is ok if it is for business or other important reasons. there is no need of them not informing you of the death of someone you are closely related to at least! if you contact them and explain the situation (maybe in writing) i'm sure they will be willing to help you.|`|AA10028372	You should be able to communicate with your family about their health history because it is not as if you are trying to associate socially with them.  If they are not aware that they can do this, you could contact the elders of their congregation and they will inform them.    Your family wants to help you come back and not punish you.  They are at liberty to tell you about births and deaths and any medical information that is of importance. You should really talk to elders in a congregation to you because stating your question on YA is like asking those that read your question to take a negative stance against disfellowshiping, its purpose and its benefits.|`|mrMkKFqNaa	Yes, the Watchtower's shunning policy is at least partly responsible.    Current Watchtower/JW doctrine allows JW family to contact DF'd family members for so-called "important family business."  Thus, the Watchtower leadership would allow your family to provide this medical information to you.  Of course, different JW congregations have various levels of "strictness."    The local JW clergy (elders) may be hard-liners, and if your family wants to stay on their good side, your family may feel that it should strictly shun you.    Whatever the reason, my heart goes out to you.  Paul described people who have "no natural affection" in his first letter to Timothy.  Unfortunately, some JWs fit this description all too well.    Regards, Jorge    ================    As a side note, I find it interesting that several posters on this question claim to be JWs (Chris, conundrum, Mrs. X, mabes, desireenyankees, etc.).  If you are really JWs, you know the Watchtower rule about communicating with DF'd people.  It is a disfellowshipping offense!    So, are you so-called JWs going to contact your local elders to let them know you have communicated with a disfellowshipped person?  Or are you going to circumvent "Jehovah's arrangement"?  Isn't that the first step to apostacy?  Just wondering...do you really believe in all this JW/organization stuff or not?

74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	Countries and borders are becoming more and more meaningless in the world of globalization.  If a President were to have ignored our greatest trading allies in the European Union, frankly I would argue that the individual is not fit to be President.    Europe has no disdain for the United States.  And please don't call America a Christian nation, it just shows that you are unconscionably ignorant.    Also, what's wrong with socialism?  About a dozen countries with pronounced socialist values have a higher quality of life than the United States.  Any government program is a form of socialism, what exactly is it that differentiates Europe from the United States in that fact?  Both provide social programs and have for decades, if not centuries.  Yet, the United States, you assert, somehow does not practice any form of socialism?  That's simply incorrect.    And socialism is anti-God?  Wait a minute:    "All that believed were together, and had all things in common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need." (Acts 2:44-45)    "There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold. They laid it at the apostles feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. There was a Levite, a native of Cyprus, Joseph, to whom the apostles gave the name Barnabas (which means son of encouragement). He sold a field that belonged to him, then brought the money, and laid it at the apostles feet." (Acts 4:34-37)    Please.  Get your facts straight.    Also, Barack Obama simply says that he is Christian to get votes.  I would venture to say he is probably agnostic.|`|xZet9Dunaa	no a Muslim undercover he believes in abortion he is no christian|`|37LKDbtsaa	Okay, now we know you're joking.

France  Germany  Europe  Europeans    These would have capital letters and so would the beginning of a sentence.    Nation in your instance would not.    Socialism not  Soclialsm.  Christian not Chirstiam.    Also, it seems you have forgotten what he is called within a sentence, is it Barry or Berry?    You don't start a sentence with 'And'.|`|O7SshRl6aa	Europe does not dislike America.  Europe thought GW Bush was an idiot and disliked HIS christian America.  So did I.  They think that overt religiosity is ridiculous.  So do I.      Because America now has an intelligent, moderately religious man as president, I'm almost ready to call myself an American again.

yGzfB96Raa	Oh yes! that's actual normal. :D Human sexuality isn't black and white there's every shade between :). Take note the human sexuality scale:       gay     bi    strait   1   234     5     678    9    No ones ever completely strait or gay/lez 1 and 9. Each side has varying intensities of attraction to either gender. Both are capable of having sexual Fantasy of each with out being gay/strait.    strait people are 6 though 8  gay people are 2 though 4  True bisexuality is rare but it happens (5)    Its all normal :)|`|2S6iXcmCaa	he is just confused right now|`|sLgI3cRpaa	nope lol  he is probably bi  who knows|`|bRAmXcowaa	i think the man is confused himself!

He's bi but trying to keep hold of his reputation and money.......wonder how often he has told followers that they are evil for having homosexual thoughts or acting on them?

Nothing that is shown them from God's word influences them. Nothing Jesus said influences them. They want their Mystery Doctrine and that's that.    Of course there are humble people still out there who appreciate clear Bible truth and will accept it when they learn it. Those are the people God is looking for to serve him.    (John 4:23-24) ".?.?.true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him. 24?God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth..?.?."|`|ksUksniqaa	Yes.  t|`|tWiRghgEaa	oh that would be a embarrassing death and very dishonorable other knights would make fun of me as I lay dieing|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That is one of the 13 fallacies in Aristotle's Sophistical Refutations.

However, we were taught lots of things by our parents and we believed that what they told us was true. For example, I was brought up as a Catholic and "believed" everything I was told.

For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with an education and a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...

Zq8cU1Kdaa	Taking the question in relation to the play: I think he wanted to tell Horatio that he should be open-minded and believe what his friend is telling about seeing ghosts and stuff.

"I want you to know that the greatest heresy in the American evangelical and protestant church is that, if you pray and ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart, He will definitely come in.  You will not find that in any place in Scripture.  You will not find that anywhere in Baptist history until about 50 years ago.  What you need to know is that salvation is by faith and faith alone in Jesus Christ.  And faith alone in Jesus Christ is preceded and followed by repentance . . . a turning away from sin, a hatred for the things that God hates and a love for the things that God loves, a growing in holiness and a desire not to be like Britney Spears, not to be like the world, and not to be like the great majority of American Christians, but to be like Jesus Christ!"|`|AA11690436	Are they similar to the teachings of Paul wingnut?|`|wuPTBIIuaa	no not me|`|9mLjDa5kaa	He has a false gospel that can't save you.

Embarrassing that even a burned out hippie knows that one dude.|`|AA10634007	In newtonian physics, gravity is an indispensable, and more importantly, a immaculate force that keeps the planets (and their respectable moons) in orbit with each other.  In outer space where, as proved by physical experiences, gravity is in fact not primitively apparent, the attraction and repulsion of particular planets around the the gravitational pull on the sun in an elliptical path, is known as the orbit of said planets in any given solar system or galaxy.  As far as the sun, it is an ever growing star created by the original implosion of the primeval universe, a theory better known as the "Big Bang" Theory.  It stays in the sky because in reality, it pulls on the earth, not the inverse of your theorem.  The pull on the sun from the earth, combined with the pull on the earth from the sun, weaker in some spots more prevalent than others, create the aforementioned "elliptical" orbit that we observe on a daily basis in astronomy labs around the world.  Back to square one, "If gravity exists, then why are the moon and sun still in the sky?" Well, if that didn't sum it up for you, then let me put it different terms:  If they weren't meant to be in the sky they would have fallen out along time ago.|`|YomAtJn3aa	............................. ...............________  ............................. .......,.-...................``~.,  ............................. ,.-.................. .................-.,  ...................... ...,/......................................  ....................., ?............................ ..........................\,  .................../.. ............................... ..........................,}  ................./.... ...........................................  .............../...... ...........................................  ..............?....._ _..........................................  ............./__.(.....~-,_............. ..................,:`........../  .........../(_....~,_. .......~,_....................,:`.........  ..........{.._$;_...... =,_.......-,_.......,.-~-,},.~;/....}  ...........((.....*~_.. .....=-._......;,,./`..../..............  ...,,,___.\`~,......~ .,....................`.....}..............  ............(....`=-,,.. .....`........................(......;_,...  ............/.`~,......` -...............................\.... ../\..  ...........\`~.*-,.... .................................|,./......  ,,_..........}.>-._\.... ...............................|...........  .....`=~-,_\_......`\,. ......... .......................\  ...................`=~-, ,.\,..... ..........................\  .......................... ......`:,,...........................`\....  .......................... ...........`=-,...................,%`>--...  .......................... .............._\..........._,-%.......`\  .......................... .........,    For the record, I put the whole image in here, but yahoo apparently truncates long words.

Email me if you want details- I could tell some pretty good stories about the relationship between dad's religion and schizophrenia...    To the Christians credit (in this case- dad's a lutheran), anyone who had read a Bible at least once in their life would know just by listening to him that nothing he talked about (when referring to his importance within the Christian religion or what the angels had said to him during one of his "visions") sounded even remotely close to what that religion stated.
4HClQObFaa	Yes. I think if parents thought their child might be gay from the age of eight there would be much less problem accepting it.    But I had no idea I was gay until after I had left school and was in the navy!    Such a plan wouldn't help me! or have helped me!    By the time I realised I was gay (the word hadn't acquired its modern meaning then, of course), I was well past the age when I realised it was unacceptable and knew that I had to hide it and that if I got caught I would be liable to be sent to prison.    I was one of the lucky ones with enough bi in me to be able to love a woman and get married and have children and I was 33 years old with two children when it ceased to be illegal in the UK to have sex with another man!    And we are still married and we have been faithful to each other for 46 years so far!    I wonder what would happen to a version of me that was 19 now.    Could he have as fulfilling a life?    Would living an openly gay life be better for him or not?    Sorry. I'm getting off the subject.|`|r5BB6CwGaa	even though your NOTE section was a bit nazish...  yes i do considering im fourteen, my parents don't know but my sister does And my guy friends at school do, their very excepting and i think it is partially due to what you just explained, i was really surprised when my guy friends at school didn't care it was really weird because usually their all like "fag" and "queer" but i think they respect me for who i am and how i was confident enough to tell them now instead of waiting until later on in life.     So yeah i defiantly think it is best to come out at an earlier age.    PS im religious but i really dont think god is pleased with homosexuals, god loves us all, but according to the bible it's not the best sourse for those of us who have faith.

But, I also think humans are more dynamic, and queer people should not justify their identities on biology if only out of fear it will lead to "cures" or patholigizing.     More directly to your question, of course it's easier. A five year old playing dolls and crying about their gender identity is a pretty obvious sign that the child's not cisgender/heteronormative. It's just harder to argue that the child chose a lifestyle, because five year olds can't even read Good Night Moon, much less Kate Bornstein, and usually don't even know what homosexuality is.     Coming out early has a major hazard, though; parents can be unpredictable, and some will try re-assignment therapy to counter gender deviance and or queer tendencies in their child. Indeed, Focus on the Family advocated that all effeminate boys be sent for reprogramming so they could be spit out as hyper-masculine (and probably miserable).|`|AA10241360	They have nationaly proven that it is scintifically impossible for anyone to be born gay. Therefore, it makes no difference. Your daughter is just be silly. Sexual orientation ill develop until they are in going through puberty. I believe we should love the person even if we do not like the lifestyle they have chosen have.|`|K6cHlzAkaa	Probably better. Not only are the children encouraged to share things about themselves but it brings the parents and their kids closer to eachother. I wish i was encouraged and told it was ok to be what i am at a more mallable age. I was told it was wrong and that it was a choice(who the hell chooses at age 7 to have a crush on the same sex school nurse when its supposedly wrong? I mean; is it a 'choice' to develope feelings for a partner of the opposite sex?). So, at 17, I ran away after I 'came out' that I am Bi to my parents(their reaction made me run).  It would be best if children were encouraged to talk about stuff that's considered taboo, both good and bad about it. Explore the topics. And they should not face any fear of reprisal or punnishment/chastizement from parents if they give them a heads up about something the parents may not like. That way, mom and dad already know and at 16 or whatever; they dont have to fear telling their parents or fear what they might say or do-b/c its over and done with.  Anyway, for the record, I do think ppl are born this way or that way. It is not a choice. It is just as profound as being born with blue or brown eyes.|`|TDjlNgrGaa	I think so. Maybe it wouldn't be so much of a shock if you had a few years heads up    I'm pretty straight acting and had a lot of girlfriends before I came out to my parents. They were shocked because they never expected it.    I think if parents love their child, it wouldn't matter anyways. But knowing something for some time is much easier for a parent's heart thanbeing confronted with the issue all the sudden.     by the way, I knew I was gay since I was 5. I kept it to myself since I went to college, but I always knew that I never found girls attractive. I've always liked guys and never did question my sexuality. It was just the opinion of everyone else that made me not tell anyone.|`|87u9GxHyaa	I think it would be better to get a "heads up". But that depends on the parents. If they are understanding then it doesn't really matter when you tell them.|`|nQEiNGkeaa	Sorry but you have stated that your daughter tried to tell you when she was 5 and you told her it was wrong.     I knew when i was about 8 and told my parents. Made life a lot easier|`|vJxuWyueaa	Are you seriously going to tell your daughter that she is a sinner? What is wrong with people these days? She's going to end up being suicidal because of you!
AA11058044	Yes, atheists have funerals and wakes.    Believe it or not, many atheists have friends and family, and sometimes these friends and family want to get together and honour the departed person's memory.    I'm not sure why you would need to believe in an afterlife to grieve the loss of a loved one.  Seems to me that funerals really don't make much sense for anyone who is religious, since they apparently believe that the person has gone to a "better place".    As for throwing in the ground, I consider burial to be an atrocious waste of precious resources and good farm land.  Not to mention the toxic side effects from the idiotic preparations mandated by law in most western nations.    By preference, I'd rather be left out in the woods somewhere, to be recycled back into the nutrient cycle of the planet by scavengers, insects and fungi.  Since regulations in most jurisdictions prevent this, cremation of whatever remains are left after organ donations and any medical research that can benefit from my bloated carcass is a slight more acceptable fate.|`|czf6uhIraa	Yes, Atheists have funerals...|`|XlhR7ooHaa	They are tipped in by dump trucks then covered by dirt.

Still LOL!|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	I would think one could have an unchristian like funeral.  I think it's quite sad that nothing great can be said for where you might go when you die.  Or to not have a glimmer of hope.  But not everyone goes to heaven in Christian person's religion either, so.... that's not a good point.    Either way, how do atheist have weddings?  Most weddings are somewhat religious.  I would figure that non believers would leave all the religious stuff out.     I would think the people who love them unconditionally would attend. I'm a Christian but if any one of my non christian friends passed away. I'd still attend their funeral.|`|XbCHUk4daa	I'll get cremated and I guess my family and close friends would attend.  Why so bitter?|`|cadb1mATaa	noone does|`|f4gR9cIDaa	I have a friend whose entire family are atheists, pretty much.  Her aunt died of cancer about a month ago, and they scattered her ashes in a nature sanctuary and had family members talk about her memory.  It was a ceremony for the living to remember her, rather than for the dead person.  But, her family and close friends attended (I did not go, as I was sick).|`|nMLomteraa	Is a dead Atheist still an Atheist?    (just another hypothetical question for you! : )    I'm just saying... If the Atheist believes that this life is the ONLY life you get, then, when he dies... he no longer exists. Is he still an Atheist? OR from the wacky evangelical Christian veiw point, Is the Atheist still an Atheist as he incurs God's wrath? (which I do not entirely believe as fundamentals believe!) Yikes! A good decent moral person is not going to hell for simple non belief. My Priest says that a nonbeliever would go to a reading room of purgatory that is so brief, so mild, that it does not deserve to be called purgatory. This reading room is to prepare the non believer for the great amazing wonderful Good News of Jesus Christ! That news is sooOOOoOoooo exciting and wonderful that one must be prepared for it!!! wow!!! Eventually, the sould would journey to heaven!  Please note that simple passive "nonbelievers" are different from those who choose not to believe or are outright blasphemous, even leading believers to not believe. .      Yes. Atheists can have funerals! Funerals are for the loved ones left behind, not for the benefit of the one in the grave! Atheists should have more people concerned about life and death than Christians! Christians are going to paradise, no worries! An Atheist death is kind of sad because the dead athiest can no longer strive to make life better for all humanity. While the Atheist is alive, he can donate blood, volunteer at the local shelter, etc, etc. The loss of a life is always valuable, Athiest or not. In fact, wouldn't Athiests value this life more than a Christian might? It is the only life the Atheist beleives he gets! He better not waste this moment, right?|`|XKNmUWAlaa	Atheists do have funerals. The ceremony as opposed to service usually comprises of readings obviously non religious, sometimes poetry and a tribute to the person who has died. The ceremony can take place at a crematorium, cemetery chapel or at the graveside. It is also possible to have ceremony in any building ie village hall obviously with consent of the owner. The British Humanist Association provide trained officiants for these ceremonies, however there is nothing to stop a family taking the ceremony,essentially the ceremony takes the same lines as a religious ceremony but without prayers, hymns or mention of God. They are not offensive to people with beliefs and often there is a time of quiet for people to remember the person in their own way, this allows people with a faith to have silent private prayers. Ceremonies generally very meaningful. Some funerals do take place where no one attends, these can be for people with religious beliefs or otherwise, generally this is nothing more than personal preference.|`|PM23RDycaa	Some do and some are cremated just like everyone else including CHRISTIANS.    Their friends and loved one again like everyone else.    Is it bash the Atheist Day or something?    ADD: I prefer an old fashion viking funeral personally.|`|DCeAcP7kaa	Funerals are to pay a last respect to the dead. Nothing religious about it. Anyways, I wouldn't mind being just thrown in the ground. Hell they could bury me in a dress upside down and piss on me and I still wouldn't care because I'd be dead.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Well the one's I know of have a memorial service, the body is cremated and scattered usually in the ocean although I know some that have been scattered on hillsides and some even made it into space.  Never went to one I find that not believing of everlasting life is rather depressing.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	This atheist is not having a funeral.  I'm happy with a cremation or just being "thrown in the ground"|`|WF085j2Daa	dont give a damn what happens to the meat when I dont live in it any longer, why do you think it would make any difference to anybody what happened to the meat, are you under the delusion that the meat cares what you do with it ROFL
AA11058044	You mean the way our respiratory passage crosses over our digestive intake?  That's not very intelligent.  Insects don't have that problem, so other "designs" are more efficient, why didn't the designer use those?    Or the way our eyes form so that there's floaty bits stuck in the humor, and the nerve attaches to the retina right at the exact point where we need the sharpest vision, so our brains have to run corrective software just to fix up the image?  That's also not very intelligent.  Octopus eyes aren't wired that way, why not use that system in our eyes?    How about the way our lower back is crap for load bearing and in entirely the wrong position to efficiently carry a bipedal stance?  It works fine in a quadrupedal stance, but upright it's totally inefficient and prone to blow-outs and tearing.  Again, not very intelligent.    Our pelvis structure is totally cocked up too.  The birth canal on the females is way, way, way too narrow to easily pass a child, especially one with as large a head as our infants.  Other primate species don't have this problem - although they have the same general structure, the passage is larger because the pelvis isn't oriented for bipedalism.  Their infants brains also aren't as large as ours.  If there was someone who designed that feature, they should be up on criminal negligence charges for the millions of women and children that have died in childbirth solely because of that crappy design.    All of these features make sense from an evolutionary perspective - developments from earlier structures that evolved to meet different adaptational requirements, but are totally unforgivable from a design perspective.    The postulation that something complex requires a designer then also has the problem of having to come up with an explanation for that designer.  Certainly anything complex and intelligent enough to design the diversity of life we see on Earth must have been at least as complex as that life - so who designed the designer?|`|AA11058044	You mean the way our respiratory passage crosses over our digestive intake?

Our bodies came to be over the course of billions of years through constant exchange of genetic material.  Different areas of the world in different circumstances will call for different prominent/ideal traits- the survivors of these areas will continue to pass these traits on to the next generations over and over and over again.  Because the environment is CONSTANTLY changing, there is a high demand for change within a species in order for it to keep up with nature and its surroundings... a perpetual game of one-upmanship until so many changes have been made in genetic makeup within a species that the gene pool no longer holds the same material and instructions as the original... and it keeps changing.|`|VLxU5112aa	Evolution.

So many "Christians" here are just dim. They have no idea of using the "Search for Questions" bar, which I will admit does not work very well.  Still, they ask the same questions that have been asked hundreds of times, the classic is of course where atheists get their morals from.     Others -    Hitler / Stalin / Mao was / was not an atheist    Something to do with "monkies" and evolution    The big bang spraying rocks round the Universe    The big bang directly forming the Earth    All priests sexually abusing kids    Evolution is wrong because it does not or can't explain the origin of life    Something about atheism being a religion    Roman Catholics are not Christians     Some blather about lack of transitional "forms"    Homosexuality always being a choice    All Muslims are terrorists    Carbon 14 is used to date old rocks    Allah is a Moon god     Muhammad was a child abuser,      The end of the world will be soon, maybe even in 2012.      And there are the morons who consistently cite Duane Gish, Kent Hovind, Ken Ham or VenomFang X as authorities.     These people are easy targets for anyone with a bit of real knowledge.     If the question was trans-substantiation or con-substantiation, or something else with a bit of theological or intellectual oomph behind it then the attackers would mostly leave them alone, or join in without attacking.    It is quite notable that few of the "Christians" that get attacked here are identifiably Roman Catholic.  Most of those that do get attacked are the American fundamentalist kind.

It is self evident that by the living testemonies and words of our 139 founding fathers lives that they being essentially of one accord in Christ did say with their mouths and with their places within government according to their various abilities did testify that the Constiution of these United States was in fact built on the foundations of a Christian morality in concert with the finger of God to press forth in the dispensation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.     The general principles upon which the Fathers achieved independence were the general principals of Christianity I will avow that I believed and now believe that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.    "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."    John Adams:  ________________________________    "Is it not that the Declaration of Independence first organized the social compact on the foundation of the Redeemer's mission upon earth? That it laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity"?    John Quincy Adams:  ________________________________     Benjamin Franklin's 1749 plan of education for public schools in Pennsylvania, he insisted that schools teach "the excellency of the Christian religion above all others, ancient or modern."    _______________________________    Alexander Hamilton:  ? Hamilton began work with the Rev. James Bayard to form the Christian Constitutional Society to help spread over the world the two things which Hamilton said made America great:  (1) Christianity  (2) a Constitution formed under Christianity.  The Christian Constitutional Society, its object is first: The support of the Christian religion. Second: The support of the United States.    On July 12, 1804 at his death, Hamilton said, I have a tender reliance on the mercy of the Almighty, through the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am a sinner. I look to Him for mercy; pray for me.    "For my own part, I sincerely esteem it [the Constitution] a system which without the finger of God, never could have been suggested and agreed upon by such a diversity of interests." [1787 after the Constitutional Convention]    ____________________________________      It cannot be emphasized too clearly and too often that this nation was founded, not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religion, but on the gospel of Jesus Christ."  The Last Will and Testament of Patrick Henry    ______________________________________...    Samuel Johnston:  ? It is apprehended that Jews, Mahometans (Muslims), pagans, etc., may be elected to high offices under the government of the United States. Those who are Mahometans, or any others who are not professors of the Christian religion, can never be elected to the office of President or other high office, [unless] first the people of America lay aside the Christian religion altogether, it may happen. Should this unfortunately take place, the people will choose such men as think as they do themselves.  ______________________________________...    This is less  than a fraction of such quotes from the founding fathers concerning the matter.  The liar hates the truth and loves a lie.  When they lie they speak their native language.     Country not founded on Christianity  The earliest document in America that was penned and signed by the first Europeans was the Mayflower Compact.  Here is the first sentence.    """"In the name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the Loyal Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord, King James, by the Grace of God, of England, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, e&. Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and Advancement of the Christian Faith, """".    This country was founded on the advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    Thomas Jefferson as President;      *  Promoted legislative and military chaplains.      * Established a national seal using a biblical symbol.      * Included the word "God" in our national motto.      * Established official days of fasting and prayer at the state level.      * Punished Sabbath breakers.      * Punished marriages contrary to biblical law.      * Protected the property of churches.      * Required that oaths be phrased by the words "So help me God" and be sworn on the Bible.      * Granted land to Christian schools.      * Allowed government property and facilities to be used for worship.      * Used the Bible and nondenominational religious instruction in the public schools. He was involved in three different school districts, and the plan in each required that the Bible be taught in our public schools.      * Allowed and encouraged clergymen to hold public office.      * Funded religious books for public libraries.      * Funded salaries for missionaries.|`|AA10685337	Answered some guy asking an unintelligible question, trying to prove god's existence through it.

CfZn9kK5aa	Do not let their words get to you too much. ::hugs:: I am sorry for the terrible things they have said.     As a Wiccan, you do not need to belong to any major sect. You are free to worship as you wish, who you wish.     I worship the Goddess. And as I need to, I call upon her many forms, her many names. For, in my beliefs, all the Goddess' are THE Goddess, her many forms. If I seek strength, I call for Athena. If I am working on my garden, I call upon Demeter.     You're beliefs are highly personal, and can only be decided by you. You may worship as many, or as few as you wish. You are free to worship Diana as you pleased, regardless or what others say, so long as you do not cause harm.       May the Goddess of the Moon, the Hunt, and Wild watch over you and heal your heart.  ----------  JIMK     You are thinking of the paganism of the middle ages. That is not the same as Wicca.

Anyone who says they know exactly what the beleifs were about is lying"     False, Gerald Gardner books are still around, and are still being read. But Wicca is very flexible.

Wicca is generally focused upon both a god and a goddess.  Those dedicated to a single deity (male or female) simply find their spiritual needs better met elsewhere.    Being "Dianic" does not require you to follow Diana.  It implies focus on the female mysteries in general.  Conversely, there's lots of pagans (Wiccans and non-Wiccans) who follow Diana, often alongside other deities, who do not consider themselves "Dianic."    Wicca attracts all types.  Some are more conservative than others.  There are many Wiccans who are perfectly accepting of the transgendered.|`|PSzzjf4naa	Wicca is a religeon put togeather with scotch tape .

LO9Ukf1Raa	You will find, Chanel, a difference in believers in a variety of Christian denominations - sadly these are churches are run by man who is imperfect. Man is not perfect. My Christian acquaintances believe different than I and this boggles my mind for we each read the Bible. Being human, this will occur. Thankfully, I do have Christian friends who believe as I do. This is a great blessing for our conversations are not then hindered by a different faith some ministers preach in different churches.    Having said that, it is the very reason I do not belong nor go to a denominational church. I put my faith and belief in indisputable Word of God - the Holy Bible. Therefore, I say with great confidence there is a hell. If you take the time and read Revelation or even do a topical study on any reference to hell you may understand that here is.

And they don't agree on everything, which is why they call themselves by different names (Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, etc).    I've expressed this opinion before, but here it is again:    A religion is a set of beliefs embraced by one or more people.  If I believe in something that no one else believes, I can call my beliefs a "religion" and no one can prove that my religion is less true than theirs.      Even some religions have dissenters within their ranks who continue to embrace the core religious principles but not all of its peripheral principles.  I remember a Methodist minister that was fired for proclaiming that Hell did not exist because God would not punish sinners in such a terrible way.  He was fired by the church elders.

I have a Bible of my own, and the Bible says that nobody has to be sent to hell, that only faith alone in Jesus without works is what saves, and that it is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.|`|bYDVTv7Maa	Because an a place in the middle of the Earth, where a man in a tight red leotard wearing red horns and has a pitchfork reins supreme, is, well, extraordinarily impossible.    :P|`|rWP4suXuaa	The bible is clear there is a hell!    It is interesting that a much higher percentage of people believe in the existence of Heaven than believe in the existence of Hell. According to the Bible, though, Hell is just as real as Heaven. The Bible clearly and explicitly teaches that Hell is a real place to which the wicked/unbelieving are sent after death. We have all sinned against God (Romans 3:23). The just punishment for that sin is death (Romans 6:23). Since all of our sin is ultimately against God (Psalm 51:4), and since God is an infinite and eternal Being, the punishment for sin, death, must also be infinite in eternal. Hell is this infinite and eternal death, what we have earned because of our sin.    The punishment of the wicked dead in hell is described throughout Scripture as eternal fire (Matthew 25:41), unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:12), shame and everlasting contempt (Daniel 12:2), a place where the fire is not quenched (Mark 9:44-49), a place of torment and fire (Luke 16:23-24), everlasting destruction (2 Thessalonians 1:9), a place where the smoke of torment rises forever and ever (Revelation 14:10,11), and a lake of burning sulfur where the wicked are tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10).    The punishment of the wicked in Hell is as never-ending as the bliss of the righteous in Heaven. Jesus Himself indicates that the punishment in Hell is just as everlasting as eternal life in Heaven (Matthew 25:46). The wicked are forever subject to the fury and the wrath of God in Hell. They consciously suffer shame and contempt and the assaults of an accusing conscience for all of eternity. Even those in Hell will acknowledge the perfect justice of God (Psalms 76:10). Those who are in Hell will know that their punishment is just and that they alone are to blame (Deuteronomy 32:3-5). Yes, Hell is real. Yes, Hell is a place of torment and punishment that lasts forever and ever, with no end! Praise God that through Jesus, we can escape this eternal fate (John 3:16,18,36).

All the hiding a nd falsehoods! All the judgmentalness! We are being cleansed by God HIMSELF!  We are being prepared for war and our hearts and minds must be pure!

The answer is in the new two verses:    Hbr 12:27 And this [word], Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.        Hbr 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:     He refers to the spiritual kingdom of God replacing all the kingdoms of men.    Check out the NLT. I love it!    Hbr 12:26   When God spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth, but now he makes another promise: "Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also."[fn6]    Hbr 12:27   This means that the things on earth will be shaken, so that only eternal things will be left.    Hbr 12:28   Since we are receiving a Kingdom that cannot be destroyed, let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe.    Hbr 12:29   For our God is a consuming fire.
b77af9f788ecbbd1984a5e2166b0d0ceaa	The first thing to do is to pray to God for guidance and go over and ask him is it something wrong with his horse?  Try and use God given power of reason to reason with him once you acquired the situation why he beats his horse.  Ask him if he wants to give it away and let someone else care for the troubling horse (be sure not blame the man for his fault that he do not turn on you).  Perhaps, when he feels the the animal is worthless, he may just give it to you.  Then you can lead the horse to animal shelter if its condition requires expert care.  If the injure is not serious, take care of it yourself.  Once the horse is back to healthy stage, you can use it to help you carry water from the river.|`|v1zyfea5aa	Pray for guidance from the Holy Spirit and witness to him about the love of God and Jesus if so directed.  Not alot different than what I do when I see people today reacting in a similar manner or aborting their helpless children.|`|HzcZwtVqaa	i would move away from him|`|lvpxPgvqaa	at this point, i wouldn't really care about the animal, i would just be worried about my own survival.  don't get me wrong I'm against animal cruelty and if the situation was different i would stop him but if i can barely survive, and if I've been walking for 2 miles and i still have to walk 2 miles back carrying a huge bucket of water, I'm probably tired by now and probably extremely thin since you said food was hard to find. i doubt i would have any strength to stand up to the man.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	If I didn't stop him, I would be as guilty as in beating the animal myself. I would stop him..|`|SWpJqs2faa	well , you wouldn't want to eat it since you said it was thin and frail besides, I would be so offended to witness such a thing. I would take it away from the man and ask him if it was ok if I did that to him. I f a person is Truly hungry there are better ways to put a animal out of his misery and eat it. Lots of people eat horse . I haven't patience or tolerance for cruelty to people or animals|`|KlXUrxBfaa	I just found a ride!|`|UujliMsCaa	Wait for him to finish beating the horse to death and eat it.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Well, if there is no technology of any sort, I'd have to ask interrupt and ask him what he was doing.  He may be killing it for food?  After all, you mentioned no weapons...

uGIIR9Beaa	The feeling of breaking someone else's heart never goes away, guilt always stays, you can never forget. Having your heart broken in the long run heals again: it's a chapter most people can close.|`|2DBlazZraa	breaking someone's heart because you're heart will probably be broken still|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I think breaking someone else's heart. In most circumstances you know what it feels like to have a broken heart and it would feel even worse knowing that you have done that to somebody else.|`|195738faa9bd63e11f670c0376aea1a1aa	I think they're equally bad.|`|Q5EftYrpaa	Breaking someone else's heart would break my heart, but getting my heart broken would probably affect only me, so it's 2 to 1. Breaking someone else's heart is worse. Also, one can always find love after getting their heart broken but breaking someone else's heart has a life in you forever.|`|QP4goOPkaa	no way..if its someone you really love is telling you that they dont love you...thats the worst feeling ever...   if you break someone elses heart its because you're not in love with them and you will only have to deal with feelings of guilt for a while...    if you are the broken heart it can take forever to get over... :(    Dana is hot but unfortunately wrong...:( :)|`|GXSod0GSaa	Breaking someone else's heart.    Rather be hurt myself than hurt someone else.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	Breaking someone elses. I usually wait til someone breaks up with me, but I recently broke up with my gf and even tho I had the best reasons and she deserved, it is killing me still.  Especially if they don't want to break up, or if its for not so good reasons :(|`|Fy9Muy6Waa	Immediately, it hurts worse to have your own heart broken. With time, sometimes more than others, that will heal.  However, in the long run, knowing that you have hurt someone else by breaking their heart is a far worse thing to live with..assuming you have any feelings of guilt, remorse, right/wrong, morals, etc. Some people are just cold hearted and it never affects them in the least.|`|jT4ttJGyaa	It's definitely worse breaking somebody else's heart. I have my own way of healing, their's might not be as safe.

Usually the guys that I know are really "manly" or try really hard to appear that way. I don't think that a guy who didnt like you or have a crush on you would do things like slap your butt... def. not kiss on the cheek. I think that a guy who isn't bi would be very wary of participating in such activities.    So yes. I would say he does.|`|QYy0vU4maa	It is possible ask him if he likes you. My guess is he does|`|FzLVbwGlaa	yeah, i bet he likes you! :D   go for it just don't make it seem too awkward around him.
4rd5IYouaa	Why is it that ADULTS think its "cool" to take Vioxx or Celebrex or a variety of drugs that help them sleep, get up, have sex, not have sex, in general just to be. And most of those drugs have side effects that sound worse than the original problem!! In addition, some of these drugs have been pulled off the market because they are LETHAL, in other words, they can cause death. Cocaine was legal in the earlier part of the last century, and no death has ever been attributed to smoking cannabis. Ever. In fact there has been documented proof that cannabis is actually beneficial for you. Do your own homework, if you want to investigate. www.erowid.com might be a good place to start. But don't come on here and act all "alice-in-wonderland" uuuhhh, geee wow, like I just don't understand whyyyyyyy....its pathetic.|`|AA12392755	For the same reasons their parents took drugs,  teenagers are invulnerable and omniscient.|`|Ts33DJSwaa	good question, i would say the media plays a large role in glamourising drug use, there is also a lot of misinformation about drugs which gives people and youth the idea that they arent so dangerous, also government miscommunication and indecision creates doubt and confusion...check out:    www.uniteagainstdrugs.com    it is a charity that work to educate the people os the uk on the facts and truths about drugs|`|NcufdPaAaa	I don't think its acceptable?  And I'm 16.    Don't categorise all us young 'uns!

But i have been told a lot of nasty stories about it and seen nasty things with drugged up friends.  I guess they think 'I'm young, why not have a bit of fun and try it?'|`|MYnH6UKQaa	people are irresponsible. thats a big one. but, on the other hand, its an experience. curiosity!! its really not to be cool for all us teens. but ya i can definatly see it.

si3eq11haa	to answer your question, do You believe in God????  what Do you believe?   do you believe in Jesus?  do you believe Jesus is the Son of God and God Himself?  do you believe Jesus died on the cross to pay the debt that all your wrong doings deserve? He did that so you could escape the punishment that your wrong doings deserved and that punishment was death and hell.  if you ask Jesus to come into your life, into your heart, and be master of your life, then yes, you would believe in God.  if you do not ask Jesus into your life, to be Lord of your life,. if you do not give your life to Jesus, then you will not go to hell.   if you reject Jesus now, in this life, then when you get to hell, it will be too late to change your mind. the choice is for now.....and the choice is yours...|`|WzsdjtPFaa	Sounds to me like you believe in him.|`|VBnzq7aMaa	Well, that depends. Have you prayed to accept Christ?    As for hell, there is no hope, and it is completely free of God, which eliminates faith, meaning if you went to hell, you would NOT be on God's side.|`|802552a2ae9165a866994effe3087240aa	Don't worry about what happens when you die.  Just live the life of a good person.  It's far more important what you do when you're alive than how you will be treated after you die. Heaven or not, we still need to try our best to be good people.  We could all be better if we try. Well, that's what I believe.|`|2J0vKZDVaa	.|`|Op81lhjuaa	Innocent or Guilty?  During a trial, the burden of proof always lies with the prosecution. That's because a person in the U.S. is innocent until proven guilty. Let's see if you will be guilty when you face the Judge of the Universe. Have you ever lied? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever looked with lust? Jesus said "You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart!" (Matthew 5:27-28) If you admitted to being guilty of these charges, what you need to realize is that God sees you as a liar, a thief, and an adulterer-at-heart. Do you see the predicament you're in? You know the Day of Judgment is coming, and your conscience agrees that you are guilty. What will you say on that Day? Would you have any words of defense? No amount of good works will help you on that day. That's like trying to bribe a good judge by slipping him a five dollar bill. The judge of the universe will not be bribed. The good news is that God has provided a way for your fine to be paid, and that is through Jesus Christ. The Bible expresses it like this: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) You broke God's Law... and Jesus paid your fine! The Bible commands you to Repent (that is to turn from your sins) and place your faith in Jesus alone to save you. Confess and forsake your sins once and for all. Do it today - you may not have tomorrow! Then read your Bible daily and obey what you read. Please visit www.TheGoodPersonTest.net|`|JqHkgWROaa	If your only reason for believing in such a being is fear of eternal punishment, prepare to have to believe in infinite number of other gods.|`|AA10043552	I think it doesn't matter what I think about what you believe. What you think about it is all that matters.    But really, don't panic about that Hell thing. Do you really think any God who loves his Creation would send his children to Hell to be tortured for all eternity for no greater crime than stealing a cookie?    A God like that would not be worthy of anyone's worship.|`|Kom3K4a8aa	Nope! That is why Jesus died for us. Sinning is wrong, but, thanks to Jesus, it is all forgiven! But you do need to accept Jesus as your lord and savior to get to Heaven.|`|ngew4AWSaa	You don't have to believe anything anyone tells you.

And alienate their unfortunate offspring to other people and opinions.|`|AA11503457	I think the enemy has proven to be very proficient at using secular rock, though I question the notion that hes had the same success using Christian rock.  You may notice how revolted non-christians are by Christian rock which is probably a signal hed prefer they dont listen to it.    I must say though, the fact that non-christians are satisfied listening to regurgitated rolling stones/bob Dylan/led zeppelin/joni Mitchell doesnt mean we have to be (same goes for the satisfaction with listening to regurgitated versions of rappers delight).  At a time like this when a generation is content with being unimaginative, imaginative Christian artists could easily propel Christian music to the forefront.|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Especially Christian rock...|`|8ab3o89Taa	Music is music. It doesn't come from "god" or "satan". It comes from the minds of people. And if who ever doesn' t like it then they shouldn't listen to it. You don't have to change the radio or turn it off.  I think it is stupid that people are trying to regulate everything you do because of something that was written in a book so many eons ago by men.

Well, I don't know about "controloling" but "controlling," definitely.  It just makes people scared into doing what it wants by threats.  Take the idea of Hell, for example.

The Bible plainly allows billions of years for the creation of the universe and plainly says that the creative days were not 24-hour ones, by calling all SEVEN days A DAY (Gen. 2:4)  However, ask yourself some questions.    For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with an education and a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    Scientific research reveals plenty of evidence of some sort of intelligent design.|`|BpNrx9Viaa	It's called Intelligent Design, it's still retarded.|`|e5d10eae9a48e059f9317d719d5b716caa	By scientific creationism do you mean believing in evolution and God?

Jesus said:  . . . saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. [Revelation 17-18]     What is Death ?  Death is a return to the ground:    In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. [Genesis 3:19]  Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. [Ecclesiastes 12.7]    When everyone is born God supplied the 'breath of life' and he becomes a living soul.   And the LORD God . . .  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  [Genesis 2:7]    Note: man IS a soul, man does not posses a soul    At death, when a man's breath goes forth, he dies - his being, his "soul" perishes. only a living man is a living soul.!  Dead is dead. There is no "soul" that goes out of the body to live elsewhere! No "soul" goes immediately to heaven or hell. Dead is dead!  For as the body without the spirit is dead, . . [James2.26]    The Sleep of Death.    At death the body returns to dust and the life force (not the soul) to the creator   . . . but the dead know not any thing, . [Ecclesiastes 9.5]  His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. [Psalm 146.4]  Lazarus was dead four days, yet he gave no report of any life after death experience. (refer John 11.39)  The Bible uses sleep as a figure of speech for death.  Jesus said: . . . Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; . .  [John 11.11]  David prayed Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; [Psalm 13.3]  And they stoned Stephen, . . . Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. [Acts 7.59-60]  . . . the fathers fell asleep, . .  [2 Peter 3.4]    And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  [Hebrews 9:27]    The Hope of Resurrection  Awake and Sing    Death is NOT the end. There is hope.  As there is a falling asleep, there is a waking up.    Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: . . . [Isaiah 26.19]   . . . them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake . . .  [Daniel 12.2]  The next event that everyone will experience will be the resurrection, as John says, to face the results of his judgment.  And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.  [John 5:29]  Jesus said: I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: [John 11.25]    What does it mean to believe in Jesus?    To believe that He is the ONLY source of resurrection life; that He paid the penalty for all of our sins when He dies on the cross and by His resurrection made possible our resurrection to eternal life; then by prayer we can invite Jesus into our lives and experience His resurrection power for daily living.    The best way you can prepare for death is to get to know Jesus right now by prayer and Bible reading. You could pray this prayer right now     Father God in heaven, I am a sinner and I need your forgiveness; I believe that Jesus died for my sins; I want to turn from my sins; I invite Jesus into my heart and life. I want to trust Jesus as my Saviour, and to follow you as my Lord in the company of your Church; Lord please accept my prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.

He created the first human pair Adam and Eve, placed them in an earthly paradise called Eden, and instructed them to have children and extend their Paradise home earth wide. They would die only if they disobeyed his instructions.Genesis 1:28; 2:15-17.    Lacking appreciation for Gods kindness, Adam and Eve did disobey and were made to pay the prescribed penalty. You [will] return to the ground, God told Adam, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return. (Genesis 3:19) Before his creation Adam did not exist; he was dust. And for his disobedience, or sin, Adam was sentenced to return to dust, to a state of nonexistence.    Death is thus an absence of life. The Bible draws the contrast: The wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life. (Romans 6:23) Showing that death is a state of total unconsciousness, the Bible says: For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) When a person dies, the Bible explains: His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.Psalm 146:3,?4.    However, since only Adam and Eve disobeyed that command in Eden, why do we all die? It is because all of us were born after Adams disobedience, and so we all inherited sin and death from him. As the Bible explains: Through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men.Romans 5:12; Job 14:4.    Yet someone may ask: Dont humans have an immortal soul that survives death? Many have taught this, even saying that death is a doorway to another life. But that idea does not come from the Bible. Rather, Gods Word teaches that you are a soul, that your soul is really you, with all your physical and mental qualities. (Genesis 2:7; Jeremiah 2:34; Proverbs 2:10) Also, the Bible says: The soul that is sinningit itself will die. (Ezekiel 18:4) Nowhere does the Bible teach that man has an immortal soul that survives the death of the body.    How Humans Can Live Again    After sin and death entered the world, God revealed that it was his purpose that the dead be restored to life by means of a resurrection. Thus the Bible explains: Abraham .?.?. reckoned that God was able to raise [his son Isaac] up even from the dead. (Hebrews 11:17-19) Abrahams confidence was not misplaced, for the Bible says of the Almighty: He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.Luke 20:37,?38.    Yes, Almighty God has not only the power but also the desire to resurrect persons whom he chooses. Jesus Christ himself said: Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.John 5:28,?29; Acts 24:15.    Not long after saying this, Jesus met a funeral procession coming out of the Israelite city of Nain. The dead young man was the only child of a widow. On seeing her extreme grief, Jesus was moved with pity. So, addressing the corpse, he commanded: Young man, I say to you, Get up! And the man sat up, and Jesus gave him to his mother.Luke 7:11-17.    As in the case of that widow, there was also great ecstasy when Jesus visited the home of Jairus, a presiding officer of the Jewish synagogue. His 12-year-old daughter had died. But when Jesus arrived at Jairus home, he went over to the dead child and said: Girl, get up! And she did!Luke 8:40-56.    Later, Jesus friend Lazarus died. When Jesus arrived at his home, Lazarus had been dead for four days. Although deeply grieved, his sister Martha expressed hope, saying: I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day. But Jesus went to the tomb, ordered the stone to be removed, and called: Lazarus, come on out! And he did!John 11:11-44.    Now think about this: What was Lazarus condition during those four days he was dead? Lazarus did not say anything about being in a heaven of bliss or a hell of torment, which surely he would have done if he had been there. No, Lazarus was completely unconscious in death and would have remained so until the resurrection on the last day if Jesus had not then restored him to life.    It is true that these miracles of Jesus were of only temporary benefit, since those that he resurrected died again. However, he gave proof 1,900 years ago that, with Gods power, the dead really can live again! So by his miracles Jesus showed on a small scale what will take place on earth under the Kingdom of God.    When a Loved One Dies    When the enemy death strikes, your grief can be great, even though you may hope in the resurrection. Abraham had faith his wife would live again, yet we read that Abraham came in to bewail Sarah and to weep over her. (Genesis 23:2) And what about Jesus? When Lazarus died, he groaned in the spirit and b|`|6rvzeOsqaa	there is no way to prove scientifically what happens.  even people who have technically been "dead" and have been revived can't say for sure.    personally, i believe that when you die, you are just gone.  it's like the electricity in a computer - you pull the plug, and within a few seconds everything shuts down.  your body, and all its parts are still there - but the electrical impluses - the "life", is gone.  your consciousness is gone.  you aren't sleeping or dreaming, or floating around like a ghost or being whisked away to heaven or hell.  you are simply no longer an animated being.  you are a dead body.|`|Wr09qsYMaa	Your body rots, your brain is dead (no longer functioning or transmitting), Everything of your physical self if kaput.

The earth is a 'sphere' NOT a circle...a ring is a circle, a snake swallowing it's own tail is a circle...AND a circle can ONLY be described on a flat surface.  That is further confirmation of the biblical fallacy that the earth was FLAT and Immovable. READ the Psalms that  speak of the 'earth fixed firmly on its foundations, immovable"!!!  Scientists have long since proved that the earth is NOT fixed firmly and immovable, but that it revolves around the sun.  TWO scientific errors in a book that is supposed to be the inspired word of your god.  Obviously your god knew nothing of science, or the universe that he 'allegedly' created.

It can even be stories as peoples way of telling their own clan of how they came to be in the specific area like telling legends of Japan or China explaining why they look different form the others.  The Old Testament for instance tells about the stories of the lives of the Jews and we who are non-Jews are merely riders-on, and now stupidly asking truth about the origins who actually should have no affect on us unless we carry even small amount of Jewish blood. Leave your comment to yourself therefore and let those who own the story find it out for themselves.

If you had told a person who lived thousands of years ago that space travel would be possible, and that you could talk to people on other continents using invisible networks of high speed information, they would have probably laughed at you, but as we know it is possible, AND it did happen.      Scientist many years ago thought that the Earth was flat, but the Bible was right all along because it has ALWAYS said that the Earth is a "circle". (Isaiah 40:22)  So I'll stick with the Bible.  The knowledge of mankind is progressive and relative.  The knowledge of Jehovah God is infinite and perfect.  I'll go with the latter.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Documentary hypothesis explains that the first five books of the Bible were not written by Moses, but were actually cobbled together from different writers including non-Israelite sources. Chunks of the Noah flood story were most likely lifted from the Epic of Gilgamesh.  Some modern scholars conclude that there is essentially no  archaeological, historical, cultural evidence for the events in the Torah. But Bible scholarship has always been part of Christian belief and traditions. It has never been a threat despite what modern Bible literalists who favour fundamentalism preach.  Despite the scholarship there is no doubt these epic moral tales are divinely inspired. It's not important that every event be proven or that stories are derived from myths or even that parts of the the Law was borrowed from other tribes. Nothing will extinguish the Bible's holiness or inspiration for us to love and serve God.|`|gyYII4AKaa	Because Noah's flood really did happen just like the Bible tells it.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	That is a very good question since science was able to prove that the flood story never happened.|`|T17pbHVJaa	It's called being brainwashed into believing that the stories from a book of fiction are real.|`|9f7328923e8ee8bd543f1c4b68806f3faa	Because they do not see God's cruelty.

Rom 1:18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who push the truth away from themselves.         Rom 1:19 For the truth about God is known to them instinctively.  God has put this knowledge in their hearts.         Rom 1:20 From the time the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see his invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.         Rom 1:21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. The result was that their minds became dark and confused.         Rom 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became utter fools instead.|`|303F69Woaa	What do you think?

It says, not to, so why are you doing it? Catholic teachings are always opposite of what the bible says.  I know, I went to Catholic school for 12 long years. When I asked your question out loud in the classroom, I was rushed off to the principles office. Bible also says, "Call no man on earth father, there is only one father which is in heaven". It's not talking about your earth father, it's talking about a religious father. See, the Catholics go against what is stated. I could go on and on. Nothing they practice is in the bible. Please check it out for yourself!!!!|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Because the priest is bored.|`|Op81lhjuaa	*  "being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus," (Rom. 3:24).      * "For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness," (Rom. 4:3).      * "But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness," (Rom. 4:5).      * "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ," (Rom. 5:1).      * "Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him," (Rom. 5:9).      * "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace," (Rom. 11:6).      * "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God," (Eph. 2:8).    As you can see, the Bible teaches us that we are made right with God by faith apart from works.  Notice how the Bible contrasts faith and works when it comes to being made right with God.  The Bible rejects works of any kind as a means of being made right with God.  You'd think that this would be clear to the Roman Catholic Church.  But, it isn't.  The New Saint Joseph Baltimore Catechism, Vol. 2, 1969, p. 199 says,        "The priest gives us a penance after confession that we may make some atonement to God for our sins, receive help to avoid them in the future, and make some satisfaction for the temporal punishment due to them."      What is amazing in this quote is that it is not Christ's sacrifice on the cross that is the focus of atonement for our sins, but the works of the individual via penance.  This is in blatant contradiction to scripture which says that we are cleansed of our sins by the blood of Christ, not by our works.        * "how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" (Rom. 9:14).      * "but if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin," (1 John 1:7).    The Scriptures teach us that Christ's blood cleanses us of ALL sin, not some, not part, but all.  This includes our sins of the past, present, and future and it is not necessary to have our sins forgiven via our effort.         * "I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly," (Gal. 2:21).      * "Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. 22 But the Scripture has shut up all men under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe," (Gal. 3:21).       * "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace," (Rom. 11:6).    The Roman Catholic Teaching is wrong because it is contrary to scripture because it uses penance, works that a person does, as a means to become right with God.|`|G4SwEHP5aa	Catholic Church still believes that a layman cannot possibly understand God's providence.

You wouldn't get tax advice from a Carpenter would ya?  So why ask non-catholic about Catholic beliefs? - Therefore I encourage you to read the links I included..they aren't that long really, just small type. That way you get the answer from the actual Catholic faith and NOT mere opinions of people.      Short Answer: Because it is biblical and take more humility then just saying a prayer to God for our sins and God likes humility. Catholics DO ask God for forgiveness in 2 ways,  once as a prayer, the other in front of a Priest who does so thru the power of Jesus, and not on their own.    Long Answer:  Here is some of the biblical evidence...    "And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing through us" (2 Cor. 5:18-20).    "[Jesus] said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.' And then he breathed on them and said to them, 'Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained'" (John 20:21-23).    Christ told his apostles to do it. He wouldn't institute something just for 1 generation until they died and then leave the world hanging. We STILL ask God for forgiveness thru prayer and are encouraged to make amends by asking the person we wronged to forgive us.  The forgiveness we receive from prayer is considered a "general forgiveness"  -- why general if it comes from God?  It is not "general" because we ask God..it is "general" because we don't HEAR anything back. We don't wait for a response from God.  We just ask, have faith that it is forgiven and move on.  Compare this to a "Specific" forgiveness, where the Priest actually replies and says "you are forgiven" -- This is more specific (verbally speaking) then just saying our prayer of forgiveness and moving on.     Confession ALSO requires a GREAT deal more humility then merely saying a prayer does.  Try it sometime if you don't believe me.  Going to a Priest and telling him your BIGGEST faults is not easy. It takes humility.  Compare that to just keeping sins "quiet" and between me and God.  It takes less courage and humility to say a quick prayer asking for help then to go in front of someone.  I'm not saying it doesn't take ANY humility..but it takes less.  Don't believe me?  Go confess your deepest darkest mistakes to your pastor.  God hates arrogance and pride -- so Catholic "confession" takes a lot of humility...something God likes and is probably WHY he instituted it.     Christ said to them: "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matt. 18:18).   Just before this moment he "breathed" upon them.. and said "Receive the holy spirit"  -- This breathe is IMPORTANT because the only OTHER time God breathes upon humanity is when he breathes LIFE into Adam.  -- So God's breathe always conveys a power or SPECIAL quality.   The power of life OR the power of the holy spirit.     He LITERALLY tells them to forgive men's sins, How are they going to do this IF they don't hear them?  This also, obviously mirrors WHAT Jesus did while he was on this planet.  Alive, -- he forgave people's sins, IN PERSON,  not threw prayer or by text-message.  It makes sense that he would continue this mechanism.    And now for some fancy latin...  Priests perform this responsibility "in persona-christi"  -- latin for "in the person hood of Christ"  -- Another wards, they are not the ones forgiving, it is CHRIST>   He is the only one which can forgive. He is the sole mediator.  They are just who the responsibility was delegated to.  They are merely full filling a responsibility given to them, from Christ, threw apostlitic succession.     For those who say it is un-biblical... is it un-biblical because you don't believe in it? -- which is arrogance.  It is un-biblical because you don't interpret those verses to MEAN that?  Then it really isn't un-biblical, we just have a difference in interpretation, but you should be able to admit there is a basis for it.  -- if you can't even see how my interpretation MIGHT be right, then again, you are being arrogant. OR is it unbiblical because you aren't aware of the biblical basis for it? -- well then that is OK, and I hope my answer helps.     "Whoever listens to you listens to me. Whoever rejects you rejects me. And whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me" (Luke 10:16).    "[Jesus] said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.' And then he breathed on them and said to them, 'Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained'" (John 20:21-23).

Do you get the picture they the Apostles have been granted the gift or power how ever you want to look at it to now act in his place. You can of course read it in Johns gospel Chapter 20:verses 21,22,23. And take notice through the epistles how when a Apostle dies he is replaced by the laying on of hands so that they receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit.And only the Catholic/Orthodox Churches continue in the fullness of the Gospel and Paul had warned in the latter days GOD would send a Delusion and there would be a falling away from the faith and that Happened during the Protestant reformation.|`|hjxsX4liaa	So he can have his wicked way with you|`|f4ik0ScQaa	It was an old medieval way of wielding power.|`|ulmKkjbXaa	You don't.

THE BIBLE CLEARLY STATES THAT WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD, THERE IS NO REMISSION OF SINS!  Hebrews 9:11-28    Did a priest shed blood and die on the cross for you?  THE ANSWER IS NO.  and he is NOT qualified.    The Bible instructs us NOT to confess our sins to men. Only to confess our faults. Look how the NIV PERVERTS the word of God. Then look at the true words of God in the KJB.    James 5:16  (KJV) Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.  (1611 KJV) Confesse your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that yee may bee healed: the effectuall feruent prayer of a righteous man auaileth much.    (NIV) Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.    These two verses DO NOT say the same things!    Watch it brothers and sisters!  Satan seeks to deceive and devour us.|`|l8N2uC6Iaa	Because Jesus who has all authority given him by the Father, delegated this to his apostles on earth.  He knew he would be leaving physically so he gave Peter the power to be his intercessor on earth.    Matthew 16:17 And Jesus answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. 18 And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. 19 And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven. 20 Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.    18 "Thou art Peter"... As St. Peter, by divine revelation, here made a solemn profession of his faith of the divinity of Christ; so in recompense of this faith and profession, our Lord here declares to him the dignity to which he is pleased to raise him: viz., that he to whom he had already given the name of Peter, signifying a rock, St. John 1. 42, should be a rock indeed, of invincible strength, for the support of the building of the church; in which building he should be, next to Christ himself, the chief foundation stone, in quality of chief pastor, ruler, and governor; and should have accordingly all fulness of ecclesiastical power, signified by the keys of the kingdom of heaven.    18 "Upon this rock"... The words of Christ to Peter, spoken in the vulgar language of the Jews which our Lord made use of, were the same as if he had said in English, Thou art a Rock, and upon this rock I will build my church. So that, by the plain course of the words, Peter is here declared to be the rock, upon which the church was to be built: Christ himself being both the principal foundation and founder of the same. Where also note, that Christ, by building his house, that is, his church, upon a rock, has thereby secured it against all storms and floods, like the wise builder, St. Matt. 7. 24, 25.    18 "The gates of hell"... That is, the powers of darkness, and whatever Satan can do, either by himself, or his agents. For as the church is here likened to a house, or fortress, built on a rock; so the adverse powers are likened to a contrary house or fortress, the gates of which, that is, the whole strength, and all the efforts it can make, will never be able to prevail over the city or church of Christ. By this promise we are fully assured, that neither idolatry, heresy, nor any pernicious error whatsoever shall at any time prevail over the church of Christ.    19 "Loose upon earth"... The loosing the bands of temporal punishments due to sins, is called an indulgence; the power of which is here granted.    He also said to the apostles in James 5:16 Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.     The other poster that said the Bible said otherwise needs to quote chapter and verse.  I did a search and didn't find it anywhere.|`|03rOCajTaa	That is what I always wondered.

hVVALFAPaa	In the Catholic church, you are usually Baptized as an infant-- your parents made the decision, you had no say in it. As you get older (the current guidelines for Confirmation in our area says high school age) YOU get to make the decision if you want to remain Catholic. This is done by Confirmation-- you confirm the vows or pledge your parents and godparents made for you when you were Baptized.    Communion is a 'community' (notice the similarities of the words) or commonly shared meal of the body of Christ. It is a little slice of bread and sip of wine that has been blessed and consecrated for this purpose. It unites all Catholics together with each other and with Christ. It echoes the Last Supper that Christ shared with his friends before he was Crucified and died.    Confirmation is done once in your lifetime. Communion should be taken as often as possible--usually once per week at Mass.    Hope this helps!|`|TMb076n6aa	Communion is taking the Ucharist for the 1st time and confirmation is the age of accountability where you know right and wrong and you commit to Christ. At least that is what they taught us growing up in the Catholic church.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	communion come first and then confirmation. I did both and that's all I can tell you.|`|93galWG1aa	Confirmation is where you vow before God to serve him and keep your purity abstain from drink and live the life of a Catholic, to accept the Holy Spirit and have the bishop lay hands on you. you reaffirm your baptism  Communion is where you take your first confession and receive the Eucharist.|`|AA12382198	First Communion is being of age to understand and accepting that bread and wine are changed into Christ's body and blood.....for most Catholics this occurs when they are 7.    When you're about 14 Catholics are old enough to choose for themselves the teachings of the Catholic Church.|`|rZmJGPidaa	Communion is the acceptance of the Holy Eucharist. That is, it is taking of the transformed flesh and blood of Christ.    Confirmation is the affirmation of your own Baptismal vows upon entering adulthood ( it is typically done between 14 and 18, though many older adults confirm their faith too at a later time). It is confirming your Christianity, essentially.

But this lesson dealt with the missing 116 pages that Martin Harris so carelessly lost and talked about Joseph Smith continually asking God if Martin could have the manuscript. Our teacher didn't finish so we will be continuing the lesson next week. It was too big a lesson to finish all up.

Lol. gtfo.|`|AA11622701	1) Since the term "congregation" refers, not the people who are attending a service like it does today, but to the people who are in charge of the service, this scripture is saying that anyone who has a hernia or other injuries to his private parts is excused from having to do the work involved in the Temple ministry at that time. Usually heavy lifting for sacrifices and the like.      You did not go on to quote the later verse in the chapter that says they are still to receive the same pay as the working priest.  It supports the principle still in use today that if a person has a disability that makes them unable to work, they should be entitled to benefits and support so they do not starve.      That seems to still be a good lesson for today's society.    2) Again remembering that "entering the congregation" refers to serving in the ministry, the excludes any priest who breaks his vows and producing a child out of wedlock from further service (you did not quote that part of the scripture).  But then also excludes the child and its descendants from the priesthood.  As children too often repeat the sins of their parents (as they are raised around it and come to think of it as normal), it is a good precaution to also exclude them from the priesthood to reduce the odds of further sexual abuses by the priest.  It does not exclude them from any other form of work, just the priesthood.    Anything that can be done to reduce such abuses is a good idea.|`|EBGdlo35aa	That's easy:    1) wear a cup  2) don't do it with anyone other than your wife      Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|b32jC7pGaa	That a lot (most) of the Bible is utter tripe.

Deu 23:2  "No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.   Deu 23:1-8    Interpreters are not agreed what is here meant by entering into the congregation of the Lord, which is here forbidden to eunuchs and to bastards, Ammonites and Moabites, for ever, but to Edomites and Egyptians only till the third generation. 1. Some think they are hereby excluded from communicating with the people of God in their religious services. Though eunuchs and bastards were owned as members of the church, and the Ammonites and Moabites might be circumcised and proselyted to the Jewish religion, yet they and their families must lie for some time under marks of disgrace, remembering the rock whence they were hewn, and must not come so near the sanctuary as others might, nor have so free a communion with Israelites. 2. Others think they are hereby excluded from bearing office in the congregation: none of these must be elders or judges, lest the honour of the magistracy should thereby be stained. 3. Others think they are excluded only from marrying with Israelites. Thus the learned bishop Patrick inclines to understand it; yet we find that when this law was put in execution after the captivity they separated from Israel, not only the strange wives, but all the mixed multitude, see Neh_13:1-2. With the daughters of these nations (though out of the nations of Canaan), it should seem, the men of Israel might marry, if they were completely proselyted to the Jewish religion; but with the men of these nations the daughters of Israel might not marry, nor could the men be naturalized otherwise than as here provided.|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	"1He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.    2A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD."    These verses mean that bastards and men with mutilated genitals are not allowed to enter church.|`|6QheioCMaa	These were laws given for those who were a part of the congregation several hundred years before Christ-the Messiah, came into the world and set people free from the laws.      The lesson is, that God is Holy, and nothing unclean or defiled by man in any way, shape or form, was allowed to enter His Temple and stand in His Presence.  They had many rules at that time.    Christ came into the world to set them free, so that anyone, through His death on the cross, would be made clean and pure in their hearts before God, through His blood, as the Ultimate Sacrifice, to God for our sins.    And so that both circumcised, and uncircumcised, Jew or Gentile, alike would be saved. Christ did, what the laws could not do, so we could be made righteous before God.    Christ told the people, that it was not what they put into their bodies, that made them unclean, that evil deeds come from the heart of a man, and THAT, is what defiles a man.|`|aNIiGpzeaa	you would have to give more than the key verses to get the context to the readers|`|tg9Wj5Bpaa	it looks like it says that somebody who has been injured and is not "whole" should not enter the church and also that a fatherless child and his next ten generations should not be admitted.     that sucks for them....  or it's a blessing in disguise...|`|eAMq1iBWaa	This is an example of how so very perfect our Father God is.

Those laws were for the sake of non-Israelites and the Catholic Church still has them in the form of Impedimenta to the Priesthood.

Sooooo you can't be a priest if you are a hunchback, have uncontrolled seizure, foam at the mouth or have any odious problem that would draw outside ridicule and disgrace the ministers of Jesus....IT's so logical that I wonder why you even ask .

f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	That's very interesting.    I think the Catechism must have been amended since I last read it.    Excellent sentiments.  Loving and non-judgemental.      It is really only extreme fundamentalists who target homosexuals.    Fortunately they only make up a very small percentage of religions world wide and are mainly confined to America.    Most branches of Christianity are accepting and forgiving on the subject.   I'm glad to see the Catholic Church has got a good viewpoint on this, too.    Now all it needs to do is to see sense about the use of birth control, and also allow it's priests to marry if they want to.

Please, sleep with your hands outside the bed covers.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	love the sinner, hate the sin|`|AA11217207	I find that the most vocal of the homosexual haters almost always have their hatred buried in their religion. My personal experiences make me think it's more prevalent in Protestants then Catholics. Homosexual rights being a much larger issue in the US then it is in Europe seem to back that observation as well.          Attacking another person with bible quotes is wrong be they homosexual or adulterers. However you could argue that most adulterers have caused harm to their family and neglected their responsibility. Homosexuality doesn't directly harm.         People do have a right to their opinion. People also have a right to interpret their own faith. (Though the information you posted could mean that Catholics that practice such hatred against homosexuals are not adhering to the shared belief of the organized church)         The real problem comes when people think their opinions and beliefs are the one and only truth. To say that one group of people are condemned by your faith and therefor should not have the same rights you do is hateful, ignorant and, just plain wrong.        If Catholic fundamental teachings say what you posted then the Catholics that still practice persecution of homosexuals have chosen to separate themselves from the fundamental body. If these points become widely known and accepted among the Catholic faith then I would expect to see the following.       Catholics who were not fully committed to one side or another are swayed by the shared belief of their faith.         Catholics who insist on persecuting homosexuals based on their religious beliefs must either change their view or isolate themselves from the church.         Over time it may no longer even be appropriate for the above people to claim to be Catholic. Some will seek to rejoin the others. Some will insist that it's everyone else who isn't Catholic and seek to preserve a fundamentalist group. Finally some will admit that they are acting under their own belief and no longer consider themselves catholic.     PS: What I said should be taken with a grain of salt. I purposely included quite a few "If" clauses.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	Catholics are so diverse; the conservatives are people who are conservative because that is their personality and temperment; they chose conservative religion because of that, not vise versa. If one starts with true religion, not their own person, they arrive at the open and compassionate religion the church proclaims in the teaching you listed.  As far as evangelicals are concerned, they have many, many, many problems; one of which is a lack of theological anchor with an absence of connection to the ancient faith. Therefore, they don't have the kind of teaching you list to guide them.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	it is not hateful to quote the Bible....its just like adultery=wrong....    please dont rant here....|`|o9cAl8xhaa	The blind hatred of homosexuals is NOT, for the most part, coming from Catholics or the Catholic Church.

RS7wQ5pdaa	lol. this question made me think of the time me and my mother had this argument. i was saying how we had learnt in school that the earth will be destroyed when the sun expands in like billions of years and she said "dont be silly. global warming is melting all the ice. we will be underwater in less than 70 years. thankfully i wont be there to see it." now even if that scenario does happen i will only laugh.   i think there is a possibility that a natural disaster like a meteor will end us like the dinosaurs but i get a feeling that human beings, the most evolved creatures on earth, will last even that and carry on. i think we will eventually master space travel and carry on for quite a while but yes we are risking everything here through all the reasons you said. however, i like to believe that we will reach a point where we start learning that we all depend on each other and start caring for this earth. it will happen. just think 100 years ago no one cared that the power stations were billowing smoke into the air. we have made some progress. it will be long and slow but we will get there eventually. be optimistic! :)|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	If cuckoos like the Iranians get nukes, our chances of surviving are slim.|`|dO46GkNcaa	we're probobly gonna nuke ourselves... the whole sea level rising bilogical attack deal wont kill everybody, nuclear winter lasts a really long time though|`|MYnH6UKQaa	the apocalypse! the world wont end but we will, along with many other species. i think its natural but we are really helping it along..
5yFnjp56aa	Simone, Can you please explain your question a little bit more than it .    Guru Nanak in Japuji(part of daily recitation) says  Air is Guru, water is father and land is our mother    Guru Nanak also in Asa dee war says:  Water is equivalent to a living organism because it is basis for all life    Guru Ram Das(Fourth Nanak) says  From God himself air was borne and from air the water appeared and from air and water whole life appeared(Please keep in mind these versions are before the discovery of words H2O chemical formula for water)    Baba Farid in Guru Granth Sahib says   Spiritually enlightened people need earth full of trees.     At several places in Guru Granth Sahib it is mentioned that God is realised through nature. Try this link    http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani...    Sikhs are not the the only custodian of earth. Sikh religion does recognise Truth in other religions. That is why enlightened people from other religions found place in sacred sikh Scriptures called Guru Granth Sahib. People whose inside is enlightened, they never argue, fools argue.|`|7RU7p7traa	get onto www.sikhnet.com -     all i know is that Sikhs are supposed to help people around them and you can depend on most Sikhs if you really need them.     Sorry if i sound biased but just tell a Sikh 'i need your help'. See for yourself,  his ego will never let you down.|`|9YTIwgIZaa	First Sikh is for Indians specificly punjabis. It's a religon when you don't cut your hair, don't drink, always have a comb, always have a sword (kirpan) wearing around your chest.  Main Principles. The word 'Sikh' means a disciple. So Sikhism is essentially the path of discipleship. The true sikh remains unattached to worldly things just as the lotus keeps its blossom over and above the surface of water. The Sikh must do his duty to his family and to the community. The main thing is leading a pure and moral life, full of noble deeds and kind words. A Sikh does not regard fasting, austerities, pilgrimages, alms-giving and penance as important things.     Bhagti: Those who know the importance of Bhagti feel like Guru Nanak Sahib that forgetting God is just like death and brooding upon His Name is life and joy. Without the nectar of God's name, the polgrim dies his misery. But Bhagti is possible after certain conditions are fulfilled:     i) Faith in God.   ii) Following Truth.   iii) Unattachment and desirelessness.   iv) Control over throught, word and deed.   v) Association with holy men(Satsang)   vi) Humanity and submission to Hukam.     Salvation/Mukti: The Guru says, "The man of God rejects salvation. He wants only love of God and nothing else. The joys of heaven are nothing as compared to the merging in the Divine Spirit. The ultimate goal of man is union with God. Man does not become God, only the spark merges in the fire. This is called self-identification." A man may have done many noble deeds but if he has not undertaken meditation on God, he cannot have any hope of Mukti. Guru Nanak Sahib says in Asa-di-Var: "That is true knowledge when the thruth is in the heart, when the dirt of falsehood vanishes and life is pure and clean. That is true living when one fixes one's love on truth and finds joy in the hearing of the Name."     Need of Guru: Almost all the great religions of the world emphasis the need of a preceptor or Guru or holy man for the attainment of salvation. The Vedas enumerate the qualities of a religious guide. Even Guru Nanak Sahib empha-sises that bliss can be obtained only through the grace of the Guru. Sikhism does not recognise either chosen prophets or chosen people. Guru Nanak Sahib did not insist on a physical Guru (Dehdari}. His own Guru was God Himself. What is important is not the person but the word-"The word is the Guru. The Guru is the word. If the devotee follows what the word says, surely the Guru will save him." That is why Guru Gobind Singh Sahib installed Sri Granth Sahib as Guru for all time. We do not need any man as Guru because the word is now with us. Guru Arjan Sahib says, "Without a Guru, liberation cannot be won. The Guru is my boat, which will ferry me across the rough ocean of existance." The Guru destroys illusions and attachment to worldly objects.     Guru Ramdas Sahib says, "The Guru is the Sikh and the Sikh who practices the Guru's word is equal to the Guru." Guru Gobind Singh Sahib says, "I live and have my being in the Khalsa." The Guru lives in the form of the Panth. He resides in the Sangat. All the Gurus are identical with Nanak. Guru Gobind Singh Sahib passed on the corporal succession to the Panth, which is regarded as the embodiment of the Guru. The Panth represents the Guru and it is progressing, With the passage of time, the Panth is evolving. It is a dynamic and corporate personality with authority to make decisions (Gurmatas) binding on the Sikhs. In this way, there is a two-fold concept of Guru-dom, one permanent, the other progressive. The Word is the embodiment of eternal and changless truth, while the Panth is the progressive, collective personality of the Guru in Sikhs.     Guru Granth Sahib is the living embodiment of the Ten Gurus. It is the living flame of the Name, which lights the lamp of the disciple. There is no place for a living Guru in the Sikh religion, bacause Gurbani is Guru and Guru is Gurbani. After all, what the Guru does is to guide the disciple by means of words, in the same way Guru Granth Sahib guides the Sikh through its song-message. When a Sikh is in doubt about any principle of Sikhism, he refers the matter to the Panth for decision.
3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	This is not a smart aleck answer.  His word states that all of creation speaks of the existence of God, that no one has excuse.    Therefore, when you appear before Him, you can discuss with Him the lack of "evidence".    I pray to God, in Jesus name, that you change your mind about this before you leave this earth.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	No, God loves you and you think He's lying so you are depending on Him changing His nature at your Judgment and He can not change His nature.     "it is fearful, but it is right to say it;that if we wished to imagine a punishment for an unholy, reprobate soul, we perhaps could not fancy a greater than to summon it to heaven. Heaven would be hell to an irreligious man. We know how unhappy we are apt to feel at present, when alone in the midst of strangers, or of men of different tastes and habits from ourselves. How miserable, for example, would it be to have to live in a foreign land, among a people whose faces we never saw before, and whose language we could not learn. And this is but a faint illustration of the loneliness of a man of earthly dispositions and tastes, thrust into the society of saints and angels. How forlorn would he wander through the courts of heaven! He would find no one like himself; he would see in every direction the marks {8} of God's holiness, and these would make him shudder. He would feel himself always in His presence. He could no longer turn his thoughts another way, as he does now, when conscience reproaches him. He would know that the Eternal Eye was ever upon him; and that Eye of holiness, which is joy and life to holy creatures, would seem to him an Eye of wrath and punishment. God cannot change His nature. Holy He must ever be. But while He is holy, no unholy soul can be happy in heaven.

So you think it's better for those people just to suffer in sin?    According to the Bible, Hell does not yet exist, but will at the end of the Millennium. When people die (both the righteous and the wicked), they do not go directly to Heaven or Hell, nor do they "float around" as ghosts. They both remain in the grave, in a state of "sleep" where they have absolutely no consciousness of anything, nor the passage of time, until Christ returns. At that time, Christ will resurrect the Saved of all time back to permanent, physical life and take them with Him to Heaven, while the Wicked living at that time will be slain by the brightness of His coming. Both they and the Wicked dead of all time shall remain dead for another 1,000 years. During that time, all life on this Earth will be dead, and Satan will be trapped here on this dark, dismal planet littered with corpses during that Millennium. At the end of the 1,000 years, Christ will return with His Saved to judge the wicked (who will be resurrected into their old, mortal bodies), including Satan and his angels. Every person will see every sin they've ever committed. Satan will attempt to lead them in an attack on the New Jerusalem, but then Hellfire will rain down from Heaven and consume them all. They will be instantly and permanently incinerated, never to exist again. They will NOT be "tortured forever", as the pagan idea of Catholicism suggests. This is not scriptural. Even Satan and his angels will be destroyed in this fire; he will NOT be tending it, poking people with a pitchfork!   The fire will completely cover planet Earth from pole to pole, burning up EVERYTHING, even the elements themselves, and all the ocean water will be evaporated. It will completely remove all trace of sin and sinners forever. Once its work is finished, it will burn out on its own. Some people use the Biblical verse that says the fire will be "unquenchable", but that only means that it cannot be PUT out, but it will burn out on its own.  Once this fire has burned out, then God will set about to re-creating the Earth the way it was in the Beginning - perfect, beautiful and unspoiled. Then the Saved of all time will be allowed to live on it, and build permanent homes and grow their own food. All the animals will be friendly, even former meat-eaters. I'm really looking forward to it.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Where did you get this stupid idea ?    Nowhere does the Bible teach "God . . . will torture me for eternity."

He never intended man to go there. But Hell is absence of God. If you don't want him then one day after you die you will know what it Truly feels like not to be in his presence.    The reason why no one is suffering like they do in hell in right now. Is because Gods presence is still with us. We may not be able to see heaven but there's more keeping you comforted right now then you no.    What did you ever do?, your a sinner. Did you ever hurt someones feeling once knowing you were wrong? Have you ever stolen anything that wasn't yours. Ect Ect.      Lets say this, your inside a house and its 50 below outside. A man inside you don't like says as long as you like I will let you stay but you have to follow these two rules.    Respect me and your roommates.     You don't like the rules but you know they are tolerable and fair.     But you tell the man to hell with you and you start telling him you can stay as long as you want an your going to brake every rule on his list.  Then you tell your roomates the man is evil and cruel. So the man throws you out and you sit and freeze in the cold.    Are you going to blame the man for your own actions? You by not obeying the rules chose to throw yourself out? Are you mad at the man because he made you follow a few simple rules? How cruel were they to follow?        In the same way God says follow my law and you can stay forever with me or you can choose to go outside but I want you to stay with me.    Which do you want, you have a choice. Its your decison whats happens to you and why would anyone choose to go to Hell? But people are foolish enough to make that choice.      You are not Christ, by saying you are a good man is claiming to be blamless and equal with Christ. Which is calling yourself God. If you are telling peopl there is no God then your trying to drag people to hell with you by influencing them. If you love your neirbor you will not lie to them by saying there is no God.
LGvwl67waa	Hi,    I've decided to open my deck for you and here's what came out:    a) I saw that he battled with himself in the past and that he was due for a change. That's why you're not seeing him at the moment.     The odds are in your favor, but someone's holding him back... A man, potentially his father or someone with a lot of authority over him.    Still, you're lucky, because the Goddess appeared and says if you want to see him again, you're going to have to meet him halfway    b) The cards you'll go off at high speed but will hit the ground when his "real life" reminds him of his obligations.    c) and d) If you want a relationship with this man, I'm afraid you'll be the one who'll have to leave pack up your things and go to him... Unfortunately, the cards say that he'll still be stuck in his need to change... I sense he's very insecure... and that you shouldn't expect him to stay in the long term.    e) I see you'd have an early marriage but, in the current state of things, you'd have a short period of happiness followed by a long turbulent period where you'd end up alone... The cards are open and say that choices need to be made, but on his part exclusively.    ... At the moment, I don't think you should be the one to make all the efforts in this relationship. Give him tips that you're interested, but let him come to you. Let him have some responsibility for your relationship. Having make choices is the only way this thing could work.

It's within and all you have to learn is to trust it.  What you can sense within you about this relationship is more important than what anyone else can sense.    To be in the spirit of your question I'll share what I sense.  There's some sort of time of transition for one of you during the next 24 months.  You might get separated and then meet up again, becoming best friends.  You might not meet up again.  Or you might stick together through it, that will be the hardest route.  It all depends on what you do with the transition.  It's all got to do with geography somehow.    Don't worry, just follow your heart.  And for goodness sakes, talk to the guy.

gD0zEnFTaa	God didn't change his plans. If God changed his plans then his word would not be dependable.  But God's word is dependable.  You can have 100% confidence he will do as he has spoken: "Israel's majestic God does not lie or change his mind.  He is not a human being - he does not change his mind." (1 Samuel 15:29).  Christians however, would like to believe otherwise.  According to Christianity, the Israelites lost the right to be God's chosen people, but that is nonsense.  The Israelites belong to God forever.  Consider what is said in the book of Jeremiah: "If one day the sky could be measured and the foundations of the earth explored only then would he reject the people of Israel because of all they have done.  The Lord has spoken."

(Probably because you saw the weakness of admitting the change happened right away !!)      6 I am the Lord, and I do not change. That is why you descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed.

There is no evidence that pre-Babylonian Judaism (the faith of the Sadduccees) believed in an after-life.

hOf38vgpaa	The term mighty God in Isaiah 9:6 is el gibbor in Hebrew. It is never used of the Father in the OT.  According to the Hebrew and English Lexicon, el gibbor in Isaiah 9:6 means divine hero, reflecting the divine majesty.    The OT speaks of more than one el gibbor. The plural elei gibborim can be found in Ezek 32:21. It means mighty heroes. It is translated in the KJV as The strong among the mighty. It is therefore talking about the strongest mighty men and definitely not deities/ God. NJB translates it as the mightiest heroes. The RSV/NRS translates it as the mighty chiefs.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: Isaiah 9:5-6 isn't about the Messiah but a king that has been born. The correct word: IS not "will be"    5      For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele-joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom;   6      That the government may be increased, and of peace there be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it through justice and through righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of HaShem of hosts doth perform this.     the only actual prophecies about the Jewish Messiah are as follows:    * The Sanhedrin will be re-established (Isaiah 1:26)  * Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance. (Isaiah 2:4)  * The whole world will worship the One God of Israel (Isaiah 2:17)  * He will be descended from King David (Isaiah 11:1) via King Solomon (1 Chron. 22:8-10)  * The Moshiach will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with "fear of God" (Isaiah 11:2)  *****In other words - this must all be accomplished in a human lifetime*****  * Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4)  * Knowledge of God will fill the world (Isaiah 11:9)  * He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations (Isaiah 11:10)  * All Israelites will be returned to their homeland (Isaiah 11:12)  * Death will be swallowed up forever (Isaiah 25:8)  * There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8)  * All of the dead will rise again (Isaiah 26:19)  * The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness (Isaiah 51:11)  * He will be a messenger of peace (Isaiah 52:7)  * Nations will end up recognizing the wrongs they did to Israel (Isaiah 52:13-53:5)  * The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance (Zechariah 8:23)  * The ruined cities of Israel will be restored (Ezekiel 16:55)  * Weapons of war will be destroyed (Ezekiel 39:9)  * The Temple will be rebuilt (Ezekiel 40) resuming many of the suspended mitzvot  * He will then perfect the entire world to serve God together (Zephaniah 3:9)  * Jews will know the Torah without Study (Jeremiah 31:33)  * He will give you all the desires of your heart (Psalms 37:4)  * He will take the barren land and make it abundant and fruitful (Isaiah 51:3, Amos 9:13-15, Ezekiel 36:29-30, Isaiah 11:6-9).

The original language reads the same.    But though the Messiah is not explicitly called 'God' in other OT verses, it is inferred.  One that comes to mind is:  Psalms 110:1 --The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."  Since the angels are not David's lords, nor are they offered the seat at the right hand of God, who else can this refer to?  Jesus applies this verse to the Messiah, himself;  and the Jews did not disagree with him.  For if it didn't refer to the Messiah, they would have the perfect argument.  Mark 12:35-37b -- Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool." '  Therefore David himself calls Him [referring to "the Christ," a.k.a., the Messiah, in verse 35] 'Lord'; how is He then his Son?"  .|`|cHfz7iPDaa	God and the "Lord God" are 2 different beings, the lord jesus is just one of the sons of god and he is not greater than his master.|`|KwVDTUJnaa	Jesus told you that not only Issiah, but all the prophets, including Moses lied to the whole world, but you try to change His words, or just skip over them as if He never said them.

a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	Christians should not circumcise. It's part of the old covenant not the new.  "Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.   Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.   And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.   You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justifed by law; you have fallen from grace.   For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.     Galatians 5:1-6"    Jesus himself is reported to have mentioned circumcision only once:     Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one work, and you all marvel.     "Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.     "If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?"     John 7 21-23    What is interesting is that he contrasts circumcision with healing, emphasising that circumcision is an injury, as well as an example of over-zealous law-keeping.

mrMkKFqNaa	The "new light" doctrine is a cover story concocted by the Watchtower to explain away embarrassing teachings and predictions.    The "new light" doctrine takes Proverbs 4:18 completely out of context and attempts to apply it to doctrine.  Proverbs 4:14-19 is an admonition to pursue a virtuous life.  The author (King Solomon) describes the path of the wicked as dark and the path of the righteous as light.    At some point, the Watchtower discovered this passage and decided that it means doctrines should gradually get "brighter," or more correct.    Of course, even if Proverbs 4:18 applied to changing doctrine, an unbiased examination of Watchtower/JW history shows that their doctrine has functioned more like a strobe light, rather than a light gradually getting brighter.    Take for example the JW teaching regarding the "superior authorities" of Romans 13.  From the time of C.T. Russell until the early 1930s, the Watchtower taught that these were the secular governments.  Then, in the early 1930s the Watchtower got "new light" and explained that these authorities are God and Jesus.  Well, in 1962 the Watchtower rejected the new light in favor of Russell's old teaching from the 1800s.    So, to summarize, here's the history of the JW teaching on Superior Authorities:  - 1870s - 1930s: CORRECT - secular governments  - 1930s - 1962: WRONG - God and Jesus  - 1962 - present: CORRECT - secular governments    Can someone please explain how this is "light getting brighter"?  It looks like a strobe light to me (on-off-on)!|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	LOL @ Curious Jorge! He hit the nail on the head- it's not a "new light", it's a "strobe light"!     As he explained, it's a gross misinterpretation and misapplication of Proverbs 4:18.     The funny thing is, they say that they are directed by holy spirit and were chosen by God to dispense His will to mankind (as if the Bible itself is inadequate despite 2 Timothy 3:16, 17). When they make a mistake that becomes obvious to the world, they turn around and say "we are a perfect organization run by imperfect men. Our understanding is still becoming clearer- the 'light' is getting brighter."     Well, wasn't the Bible also penned by "imperfect men"? Yet, it retains 100% unchanging accuracy! So, the whole "prefect organization by imperfect men" excuse holds no water, because the Bible is a prefect book penned by imperfect men yet never changes and is never wrong! The organization is and has been wrong on numerous occasions! What does that tell you about them?    Heather B- What "new information" did the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses receive that no one else had access to? The Bible hasn't changed- only the Governing Body's interpretation of it has, particularly when their interpretations prove to be grossly wrong! If you cared enough to know the real truth, you can research it and find out that this is the case every time their interpretations prove erroneous.     Besides, Proverbs 4:18 is not a prophetic verse to let us know that more Bible information would become available at a future time. If you'll bother to read the verse before it, it simply contrasts the difference between a wicked one's life and a righteous one's life. In fact, if you take the entire book of Proverbs into consideration, it's even more clear what is meant by 4:18. Why stand behind and make excuses for a governing body that is obviously and consistently wrong!?|`|42bcc4ebcb36a7f8fe6176ea021f105eaa	JW change there doctrine?

Now I understand it to mean that time has caught up with a stated position. Why cant the bible just be understood in the context in which it was written and the fact that times change acknowledged. Off course there is wisdom in the bible. And the Koran and many other books, but times change and understanding must be understood to be subject to the norms of a society. God has us on auto pilot.

You could say you saw it in a new light.  Here is a scripture to show that this was going to happen.  Proverbs 4:18  But the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.  NWT    18 The way of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn,        which shines ever brighter until the full light of day.

Instead of taking responsibility for the many doctrinal changes they have made, the watchtower society blames their flip-flops on god, by claiming that each change was actually a result of the "light getting brighter".     As is typical with other high-control groups, the watchtower society attempts to replace god in the minds of their followers. If they do it, it must be at "god's direction".|`|oVHFz52Laa	They give lousy excuses for their previous false teachings|`|RMMdGYCDaa	The bulb in the watchtower burned out and they needed a "new light"

Our Lord set a little child before them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and examine our own spirits. John 3:3 " Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	It speaks of an attitude of humility.|`|EM0kiImHaa	This is how Jesus characterized conversion. Like the Beatitudes, it pictures faith as the simple, helpless, trusting dependence of those who gave no resources of their own. Like children, they have no achievements and no accomplishments to offer or commend themselves with.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Matthew 18:3  And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.      The necessity of humility, Mat_18:3. His preface is solemn, and commands both attention and assent; Verily I say unto you, I, the Amen, the faithful Witness, say it, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Here observe,  [1.] What it is that he requires and insists upon.  First, You must be converted, you must be of another mind, and in another frame and temper, must have other thoughts, both of yourselves and of the kingdom of heaven, before you be fit for a place in it. The pride, ambition, and affectation of honour and dominion, which appear in you, must be repented of, mortified, and reformed, and you must come to yourselves. Note, Besides the first conversion of a soul from a state of nature to a state of grace, there are after-conversions from particular paths of backsliding, which are equally necessary to salvation. Every step out of the way by sin, must be a step into it again by repentance. When Peter repented of his denying his Master, he was converted. Secondly, You must become as little children. Note, Converting grace makes us like little children, not foolish as children (1Co_14:20), nor fickle (Eph_4:14), nor playful (Mat_11:16); but, as children, we must desire the sincere milk of the word (1Pe_2:2); as children, we must be careful for nothing, but leave it to our heavenly Father to care for us (Mat_6:31); we must, as children, be harmless and inoffensive, and void of malice (1Co_14:20), governable, and under command (Gal_4:2); and (which is here chiefly intended) we must be humble as little children, who do not take state upon them, nor stand upon the punctilios of honour; the child of a gentleman will play with the child of a beggar (Rom_12:16), the child in rags, if it have the breast, is well enough pleased, and envies not the gaiety of the child in silk; little children have no great aims at great places, or projects to raise themselves in the world; they exercise not themselves in things too high for them; and we should in like manner behave, and quiet ourselves, Psa_131:1, Psa_131:2. As children are little in body and low in stature, so we must be little and low in spirit, and in our thoughts of ourselves. This is a temper which leads to other good dispositions; the age of childhood is the learning age.    May God bless you as you study His Word        King James Bible|`|yzRHAWNhaa	What do "Adults" do that differs from children? They fend for themselves instead of waiting for the parent to supply. When you pick up your cross and deny yourself daily that means to let it go and give it to God, like instead of getting upset and pissed off at someone:    Ro:12:19: Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.    And when we need something like money instead of worrying about it we deny ourselves and give it to God:    Ph'p:4:19: But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.    Take care and may God bless you spiritually. ? ? ? ?|`|23kap6Feaa	Ezekiel 23:19-20  Yet she increased her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth when she engaged in prostitution in the land of Egypt.

I believe that this is saying that we have to have the mind of a child, open and receptive and trusting.  Once we are converted (saved - born again) whichever phrase you prefer, we do accept, without question, the teachings of Jesus but, prior to being saved, we would have questioned many things that we now accept. Children are much more ready to accept that something is true when told that it is. Once we are saved we are God's children and He wants us to trust Him absolutely.|`|4FblwdYeaa	"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.    ***SPOILER WARNING***  If you want to remain ignorant stop reading here......................

He is saying, don't assume anything.......... and to give you the answer to the question of life, its right now. Now is the only time you can become like a child, for when you die you lose your body, once you become like a child now you won't just see the kingdom of heaven you will be the kingdom of heaven.|`|KwVDTUJnaa	3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  Matt 18:3 (KJV)    To be converted is to forget everything you believed to be true concerning God, it be taught anew.    To become as little children, is to be able to learn new things.    Jesus said;   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you "not" that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  John 6:32 (KJV)    14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,  John 3:13-14 (KJV)    22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. John 4:21-22 (KJV)    Jesus brough us the "Truth" but, you will not let go of the old, in order to learn the truth.

If what you are referring to is that we have to repent to be saved and not simply have faith in Jesus, I totally agree.  This is what the Bible teaches.  When you have complete faith in Jesus, you will turn from your sins in repentance.  Repentance is commanded in the Bible.  Belief in Jesus without repenting is not true salvation.  I am so sick of the fallacy that all you have to do is believe that Jesus was the savior.  That is based on only 2 or 3 scriptures taken out of context.  That is the mainstream teaching, simply because people like to have their ears tickled.  With the help of the Holy Ghost people can turn from their sins and live without sin.  Of course people will make mistakes and must repent daily, God  gives us the power through the Holy Ghost to be overcomers.|`|AA10263279	Ray Comfort does not make sense to alot of people...including ME...

The process of Iman comes with Taqua and that Taqua comes with practice. Not practice the real world as we see it, but practice the relationship with Allah SWT and all that mercy he gave you.    That you which walk up known as stairs are those things that you can run up and you may skip one or two if you are good enough as they are stairs.  Once you reach a level of sabr you then reach a level of salam. You fast to show you something greater than what you could have done without Ramadan. Yet Allah SWT has given you an ability to not pray 50x but 5 as Rasool Allah SAW send down for us a call to pray, and athan began. You never have to go further than that, its all ready for your own will and will power. No one said run up the stairs. So take it slower and relax, Everything in balance for the 5,0000x I tell you all its about 12345 and Allah is at the top! This place if not also used in balance is 5.

I used to be the same way. What I started doing was learning more and more about Islam to increase my imaan. I now have no doubts in my mind Islam is the truth. Try learning more to increase ur imaan. After that, I started feeling so bad about missing salaats that I thought Allah will punish me for missing them by killing a family member or something, I still feel this way. What truly recently changed me drastically was another users answer to a question like this. She said her friend who was always too busy studying for school to do salaat one day died after her graduation party. She said she got a sholarship and was accepted into a top universaty, but in the end it didn't matter bc we al die the same way we came, with nothing. When were dead the only thing that matters was our good deeds and deen. None of us know when well die, so pray every salaat as ur last. Honestly, and not to be mean, us missing salaat, especially for no reason at all, is pathetic. I mean, u have time to ask this question, why not pray salaat? Not praying out of negligence is the first step in leaving Islam, do u want that? We r all so lucky to be chosen as Muslims, we shouldnt take that for granted!|`|RsAhiIuxaa	ahh sis im the same with u!!  i always get 2 lazy to pray my fajr and isha prayer the resst i can do them but theirs no desire for isha and fajr prayers, asta'firullah but i dont know what 2 do anymore! ill pray 4 u and me and any1 that needs it inshallah,     may allah bring the desires back, pray our salat on time, and exept our prayers  AMEEN =) asalamu'alikum.|`|kjUqJLyKaa	you are choosing not to. we have free will over whether or not to pray and worship Allah. its up to us to do whats best for us.

Our Bible tells us that if we have a problem within the church, we are to take it to the church elders. If they cannot help us solve the problem we then take it to the church, literally.     He's a Christian, just like I am. I understand that you're not attending his church, nor are you a Christian. However, your children have a right to be supported by [both] parents. As a Christian, he's supposed to be Christ like. And right now, he's not.    I'd call the church and make an appointment to speak with the Pastor on a matter of a "personal reason". That's all you tell them. If they ask if you're a member of the church. That part is up to you what you say. Just know that most churches have a members register they can check to see if you're telling the truth. You can also tell them it's a matter of great importance regarding children of the church. They don't have to be members of the church, your ex is, that's enough.

Priorities should be: 1st Your personal relationship with Christ, 2nd family, then 3rd Church or work.  I'm sorry you have such a sorry ex, but dwelling on his faults will never help you.

True story:  I was at work one day, when one of my employees came into my office.  "Can I ask you something?" he says, "I know you're up on evolution and all that science stuff -- I need to get some information on it 'cause we're having a debate at my church, and I'm on the evolution side."    Now, as this guy was a hard-core born-again christian, I felt a little excited that he was actually going to think, and take up the factual side of this debate.  So I start pointing out some good books, some good websites, some sites that debunk creationism, etc. when he interrupts me...  "Oh, um, wait -- you don't understand.  I got assigned the evolution side, but I'm supposed to *lose.*  This is all way too much."    So much for debate.    Peace.|`|V60mZea1aa	Not I,I am Atheist,  but I have listened to one .

For example, God mentions He will open the windows of Heaven and pour out blessings when you give back your tithe to God. He even challenges us to do it.

You are trying to employ science to discover truth.    Is this because you think they are the same thing?    If you are genuinely interested, I suggest you start from the beginning and think things through carefully.  The beginning is: what is the difference between truth, reality, fact and eternal truth?    He is as real as you and I, but don't let the question of His existence tie you up and distract you from what's really the problem: that He is there but you can't see or hear Him.

If you don't believe in Him, fine, that's your problem. Live with it!|`|Lk4aCBACaa	As a theist, I have no problem admitting that there is none. All religious people have only their own personal experiences and intuition to go on, neither of which constitute "proof" to anyone but ourselves. Nor are anyone's holy writings or myths "proof" of anything to anyone outside their religion.    Now as far as "supernatural" things like paranormal phenomena, energy work, etc. there may be a small amount of measurable scientific evidence, and some tenuous links to quantum physics and such, but it's all far from being proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. In general though, I do think there are some of these things for which science simply hasn't found the explanation *yet* and will in the future.    I'm perfectly willing to say I don't have all the answers and that I could be wrong about some of the things I believe. But even if I am, it doesn't change much in my daily life: I chose my spiritual path because it is inspiring and fulfilling to me, and it wouldn't be any less so.|`|PoxcQk5Gaa	You give me empirical, testable, repeatable evidence for the existence of the laws of logic, and I'll give you empirical, testable, repeatable evidence for the existence of God.

Salvation is not by following God.  It is by believing the truth about Jesus, who is God  :)  Jesus loves you so very much!    Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	Then just do what you know is right according to God's word.    we all fail everyday,  that's what the cross is for.

"God" is everywhere and cares not about the rules created by man.
24H5tznkaa	Well, a spread like the three card spread, is only going to give you the past present and future. It is rather limited. The Celtic cross on the other hand:    http://www.learntarot.com/ccross.htm]    has many more positions, more information on outside influences, your strength, your foundation etc.    It tells a fuller story of what's going on inside and outside of you....as well as giving you the past, present and future.    http://www.essortment.com/hobbies/introd...    *edit*    In my opinion, our minds have a lot to do with how the spreads work. Something like the Celtic spread, has been used for a long, long time. That being said, it is basically rooted in the collective consciousness. So when you lay the spread out in that way, you are tapping into that collective knowledge of that spread and the cards will fall in the correct places. Even if you consciously don't remember what all the spots mean and you have to refer to a book or website, you will find that the cards fell in their appropriate places.     If you pull 11 cards and lay them out going straight across, I am pretty sure that you would end up with past, present, and a sort of story line of future events/possibilities.     I have altered the 3 card spread with what I like to call 2 bridge cards. They fall in between present and future. They basically are the determining factor as to whether the future card will manifest or not. But still, the cards read the same. The bridge cards are very near future and the future card is near future. I can keep pulling and it will go into distance future.    It will happen that way whether I want it to or not.  ;)  Perhaps tarot/oracle cards are hooked up to some Universal blueprint or something.  :)|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	You know, that's a great question and is one I honestly can't answer.

Ezekial 28   " 'You(satan) were the model of perfection,         full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.  13 You were in Eden,         the garden of God;         every precious stone adorned you:         ruby, topaz and emerald,         chrysolite, onyx and jasper,         sapphire, [b] turquoise and beryl. [c]         Your settings and mountings [d] were made of gold;         on the day you were created they were prepared.  14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub,         for so I ordained you.         You were on the holy mount of God;         you walked among the fiery stones.   15 You were blameless in your ways         from the day you were created         till wickedness was found in you.  16 Through your widespread trade         you were filled with violence,         and you sinned.         So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,         and I expelled you, O guardian cherub,         from among the fiery stones.  17 Your heart became proud         on account of your beauty,         and you corrupted your wisdom         because of your splendor.

The Bible tells us that the Genesis creation was "good." There was no sin and therefore no suffering or death. Why then did God give Adam and Eve the ability to sin, knowing full well that they would sin and bring death and pain to the human race? Some believe that if Adam had been created without the ability to chose, then he would have been a "robot." A father cannot make his children love him. They choose to love him because they have a free will. Others point out that humanity would never have seen the depth of the love of God, as displayed in the cross, unless Adam had sinned, and that fact could be one reason why God allowed sin to enter the world.
NYU37jfGaa	After her father's death, Cleopatra ruled Egypt jointly with her brother/husband Ptolemy XIII.  This was not (as a comment above suggests) paedophilia, marriages between brother and sister were customary among Egyptian royalty, and the Ptolemy dynasty had adopted this Egyptian custom.    Cleopatra was ambitious, and wanted to consolidate her own power, so when her brother Ptolemy XIII started a war with her, she managed to persuade Kulius Caesar to be on her side.  He defeated Ptolemy XIII, and reinstated Cleopatra as Queen with the young Ptolemy XIV.  Cleopatra bore Caesar a son, and eventually went to stay in Rome.  While she was there, Caesar was assasinated, and Cleopatra hastily returned to Egypt.    She next managed to charm Mark Antony, one of the Triumvirate who ruled Rome after Julius Caesar's death.  Together they tried to form their own empire in rivalry to the Roman empire.  She financed his disastrous campaign in Asia, and they had three children.  Eventually, Cleopatra's greed for territory lost her the support of Herod of Judea, and she and Antony found themselves forced to fight the forces of Rome.  They were defeated, and Antony and Cleopatra both committed suicide.    Although Cleopatra's political schemes to protect Egypt's power and her own had totally failed, she remains one of the most haunting figures of romance and ambition in history and literature.|`|VDdEMPsdaa	phedopholia she f her own brother|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	She Slept with Julius Cesar and Lost Egypt to The Roman Empire ...

I see no collision or feel no need to choose between Genesis and science and I believe those who do feel this push/pull experience it because they don't understand what science is.  To understand what science is - and what it is capable of and not capable of giving us - one must understand the differences between truth, reality, fact and eternal truth.    Personally, I believe that science is a tool that allows us to reveal God's power.  I believe the best scientific idea we have on creation is the Big Bang, and I personally love sitting back under the stars several times a week as I do and picture what it must have been like when God clapped his hands and caused that.  I imagine this mind-blowing sound and a sense-numbing display of distortion and force. Truly cool.    My favorite part of the Big Bang theory is that a Catholic priest was the one who came up with it.  Georges Lemaitre, I believe is his name, in Belgium.    I also, after having studied the theory of evolution, realize that so many people misunderstand and misrepresent it.  Evolution does not claim that it is the origin, it merely describes a process that occurs after origin.  Charles Darwin and all leading evolution scientists/thinkers agree that they haven't the slightest idea on origin and that evolution starts AFTER origin.  Besides, it's almost hilarious how many scientific discoveries continue to appear that cause this theory to have a lot of problems.  But no big deal - that's science, and that's why science isn't the same as eternal truth.    All of this is intellectual curiosity at best.  All you need to know you already know - we come from Him.  Be less bothered with "how?" and focus on what you're supposed to do now.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	Big bang theory was formulated by a Christian cleric not an atheist and he evidently had no problem exploring a scientific explanation for the origin of the universe while still believing in God.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	consider the bible a collection of colorful fairy tales and everything will begin to make sense.|`|075c7DdDaa	Who says the universe was created?    Why can't it always have existed?  It's just expanding.|`|RMMdGYCDaa	Cosmic singularity did it.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Remember two things:    First, what you "want" to believe should be irrelevant. Reality is not dependent on what we "want".    Secondly, taking an interest in scientific discovery and knowledge does not preclude you from keeping your personal value in the bible. You should see the bible as a collection of stories and parables that express important ideas and messages, not as a historical account.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	Some ones have understood that the earth is 6000 thousand years old and they affirm the bible teaches that, but the bible doesnt mention that subject. In genesis 1:1 we read the in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and in the next verse we read that the earth was empty and void. But the prophet Isaiah affirms that God did not created the earth in vain but to be inhabited. In the version called Almeida Revista e Corrigida, one version in portuguese equivalent to the authorized king James version, it says God did not create the earth empty (Isaiah 45:18  Almeida Revista e Corrigida). In genesis 1:2, the hebrew word translated as was denotes also became. In Isaiah 35:11, the words translated as confusion and emptiness can be also destruction and ruin respectively. These words are the same Hebrew ones in Gn 1:2 translated as without form and void. With these informations, we can be sure that something happened between Gn 1:1 and Gn 1:2 that destroyed the earth. Gn 1:2, therefore, is a RECONSTRUCTION of a destroyed earth. That all we spoke about lead us to understand that between Gn 1:1 and Gn 1:2 there are many days, months, thousands of years, millions of years, or even billions of years. None knows, except God. The bible doesnt reveal the age of the earth, therefore. If so, the billions of years that science gives to the earth can be true as well as it can be false. About the dinosaurs, they probably were created before the reconstruction of the earth (Gn 1:1), considering as true that man did not live with dinosaurs in any time. Therefore, all fossils, etc... can be okay comparing with the bible cause they can have existed before Gn 1:2.     Blessings.|`|015c4be64c1987ae727eabb9ce9cc03baa	There is no reason to think that they were created.  They exist, so they "came to be" or "came to exist", however, there is no evidence they were 'created'.  Create is something that humans do.  Humans certainly didn't create the universe or humans.  There is no evidence of anything else we know of that 'creates', so theres no reason to think that the universe and or humans were created.|`|RTaimrg7aa	The universe was created.  There is an improbability so great of the universe happening without a creator as to make it an impossibility.  I could go into lengthy explanation of this, but if your interested in fossils start with how they are dated through Radiometric Dating.  Look it up on Wikipedia (which is a relatively evolutionary biased site, but does have a wealth of information.|`|V63jOkvsaa	You should read The God Delusion, or The Blind Watch Maker, both by Richard Dawkins. And the whole bible|`|Q9boyc5Iaa	You are asking the right questions.  All I can say is, if God created the world, he sure wants us to believe in evolution and the big bang.  Why would God place all this evidence in front of us which contradicts the bible?  My answer is that the bible is false and God doesn't exist, but there are a lot of deists who put God in the gaps of our knowledge.  As our understanding progresses, there are fewer and fewer holes for God to hide in.  I think you may be a closet atheist.  A lot of us started where you are right now.|`|KbRIqrmhaa	The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.    Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.    The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in waterconversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.    When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.    So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.    But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.    Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."    Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying "There are as many ways to God as there are souls...."    Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.    The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."    The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.|`|OItPJZjBaa	Well, I am a Christian myself so I understand that it is hard to believe. If look at the scientific facts of Darwin's theory it's almost hard not to believe in that theory.  Although, nobody really knows the truth on how we all came to be.  My husband believes that all religion was created to control the masses of people to give them a purpose in dark times. He believes that religion was inspired by the heavens but created by man.  In other words when those people created religions they figured if you were constantly in fear of the the Great Eye In the Sky, they must have figured people would then do no wrong.(I hope this does not offend you, sorry if I did).|`|3OJVjdIJaa	mostly big bang|`|EtCRnDJMaa	well, maybe there was a Meteor Creator that hit Earth that had some cell like organisms on it or in it..

Alexander Friedman first put forth the idea of a changing radius of the universe in 1922.   Monsignor Georges Henri Joseph douard Lema?tre put forth the same idea 5 years later and was simply lucky enough to have Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington secure him a hearing before the scientific community of the time.    I am not saying that Lema?tre wasn't a brilliant man, but I certainly wouldn't give credit to any mind control cult for his brilliance.|`|AA10556726	I'd encourage you to objectively evaluate the evidence, not only for creation, but for other events in the Bible.  What you will find will probably surprise you.  Not only is creation in doubt (being very nice here, in reality it should be considered a myth), but the Flood, tower of Babel, the Exodus and the conquering of the holy land did not happen.    I was amazed when I started researching creationism, I was worried about the same/similar things that you are noticing and I wanted to be able to present a sound case to my daughters.  It did not take me vary long to realize how flaky creationist claims are while on the other hand, the scientific evidence for evolution is substantial.       The following are some interesting links that will give you some introductory information.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	It is only hard because you make it hard. We as human beings are always trying to figure out God and His word instead of simply believing what the Word of God says is truth.

If I remember my ancient history class correctly, which was a few years ago, The jews actually borrowed a lot of their mythology from the Babylonians because when Babylon defeated the Israelites, they still let them have religious freedom. The Egyptians, polytheistic, no brainier. Persians, I thought they were who the greeks fought against in the punic wars... wait I found something, the persians started out polytheistic but then started practicing Zoroastrianism which is monotheistic so the Persians would be your answer. Sumarians, polytheistic no brainer once again.

So the women didn't return to their hometown, they followed their husbands to theirs.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	Harrod who was king at the time had made a decree that everyone should be taxed and so  Bethlehem was where Joseph had to go to pay his taxes.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	The Tooth Fairy told them to.|`|ulmKkjbXaa	Two reasons.    1.

But also it fulfilled the prophecy in Micah 5v2 [and also recorded in Matthew 2v6 ] that out of Bethlehem would come a ruler.... read for yourself.

I'm never praised for using racial slurs, and whites that want to be racist always will be (and they have the respect, power, and clout to spread their hatred of blacks worldwide).    Sure,t here is a slight double standard (Black comedians can make fun of whites a tiny bit harsher than white comedians can make fun of Blacks), but truth be told, most whites laugh off Blacks that are racist since we do not have power, support from other races (white racists have support from east asians, indians, middle-easterners, and many hispanics) and we are at the bottom of the "Racial totem pole". People that are above can use race to persecute those below; you can't persecute upwards (unless you have a huge advantage in numbers like in South Africa, and even then, a good deal of it is a thirst for revenge).    Some more interesting double standards:     Why is it OK for white guys to sleep with many asian women, but bad when Black guys want to get some (and we often fail at that since asians depsise Blacks and worship whites)?    Why is it OK for whites to conquer other lands and subjugate people, but wrong when Blacks want to have their own?    Why is it wrong for Blacks to tell a few racist jokes or make a few remarks (that won't be acknowledged by anyone really) when whites have spread hatred and tales of Black inferiority all over the world (and people actually believed them)?|`|4Za1utmCaa	Easy question to answer.    First off, it is not OK to be either, but black racists are cut more slack because they do not have anywhere near the same power to oppress and discriminate at the same level white racists do.

You probably wouldn't say this to other African American people in person (with the exception of your brother-in-law), so why do you feel it's okay to say it online and get confirmation from the yahoo community?  We're not going to agree with you if that's what you think.  People who ask questions similar to this one do it for confirmation and reassurance.  I'm pretty sure you don't ask these questions to get real answers like this one.  I also see the trend that when people ask these questions (which in my book can also be considered as a form of racism) they always feel they must state that they have a "black best friend" or family member.  Okay.....good for you....your brother-in-law is black, that doesn't exclude you from having racist tendencies just like everyone else.  People who feel the way you do want to feel like they are being victimized when really you are doing the racial profiling!  Accusing one group exclusively as being racist is a form of racism my friend.  I don't doubt that alot of black people are racist (as well as whites and everyone else), but you have to find a way to voice your opinion more effectively or shut up all together because many could take offense to this.  I am half black, and certainly would if I actually cared about your opinion. Why is this still a black and white thing? I hate that concept because this is America, and we have so much diversity that we not only have black and white, but everything in between, so wake up, and good luck, and I'll make sure to pray that maybe you and your brother-in-law stop drinking and running into racist people.|`|gg4iNrnMaa	why should their be any type of racism?|`|CuHfhI1qaa	I understand what you're saying. It shows in little ways, like ppl of color are encouraged to have ethnic pride and white ppl are discouraged. We have black history month, can you imagine white history month? In high school for cultural day you can be proud to be Asian, African, but OMG what if you were proud to be caucasian? There's a United ***** College Fund what would happen if we made a United Caucasian College Fund? If a black man says he would only date a fine black African queen, everyone would applaud him. If a white man said he only wanted to date a fine white European queen he would be racist. If a black mother loves her babies beautiful chocolate skin and was proud of it she's loving, if a white woman loved her babies beautiful white cream skin and was proud of it she's racist

It is not representing a false concept of him never coming off the cross. It is purely representative of his love.    Think about this: A man you never knew suffered and died for you 2000 years ago, so you would not have to suffer. His death, which occurred by heart failure resulting from cardiac tamponade (A condition of swelling of the pericardial sac around the heart. This is an extremely painful death.), by hanging him on a cross after beating him for hours is the greatest symbol of love ever given to mankind.     I can't watch the Passion without crying, but I appreciate what he did beyond all else. The crucifix is not to remember his pain, but his love.

The only valid reason to change religion is because you believe it to be true.    My personal advice is that you find a nice Catholic boy to date.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, normally I would say "no problem" - but with Jehovah's Witnesses, you have to use some foresight.  This is why:  Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs) are not permitted to associate with anyone who rejects their doctrines.  JWs have some Christian doctrines that are *quite* a bit different from Roman Catholic doctrines (for example, they don't believe that Jesus is God).    So, understand the consequences of changing your religion.  If you do *not* believe what the JWs teach, you will be living a lie, you will be a Christian who lacks integrity in her relationship with God.    SO, my advice is that you make a *thorough* study of what the JWs believe before you become a JW.  You should NOT jump into that sect blindly because they *do* have very strict regulations regarding what you must believe, what you must do and how you must be treated if you ever abandon those beliefs.    Jim, http://www.bible-reivews. com|`|AA10034051	No never change anything about yourself for a boy/man. Find a nice catholic boy to date and also what do your parents think of you dating a JW?|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	No, not MERELY for him. Then again,  IF you can so easily discard your religion, then you have grounds to question if you really believed to begin with.  IF you actually do believe..then it is an internal belief..something that is part of you and you can't merely shrug it off and change.     So I think FIRST you have to be honest about yourself and think about whether or not you are "pretending" to believe, simply because Catholicism is the faith of your family...OR if YOU are Catholic yourself..meaning it is an internalized belief.    THEN,  based on the outcome of THAT introspective journey.. you will pretty much know the answer to your question.   It will be either OK with you because (to paraphrase) "I never really believed that junk anyways"  OR it WON'T be OK with you because you "truly" believe.       I WILL say this -- Faith and Money are the 2 biggest reasons people divorce.  Having an Inter-Faith marriage will cause you considerable stress on your marriage IF you are both devout in your faiths.  You will ALSO have to decide how to raise the kids.  I know this first hand because my Wife is Baptist and I am Catholic.     Make sure HIS family will respect you and leave you alone if you decide to NOT convert. Make sure you will be able to go to Catholic mass without pressure or interference.  Respecting YOUR religion as you respect theirs is ONLY right.     IF you want to get married in a Catholic church, then you have to sign a document that you intend to raise your kids Catholic.  The Church does this so that HOPEFULLY the 2 of you discuss how to raise the kids before hand AND you don't use the fact that your spouse isn't Catholic as an excuse to dodge your feduciary responsibility to your kids. It is not fair to THEM that they don't get any Catholic instruction or even that option, simply because your spouse is not.    The Inter-faith marriage then has to be signed by the Bishop.    Obviously Catholics are not perfect.  Our mistakes are worldwide front page NEWS all the time. Catholics are STILL answering to things we did in the middle ages. - funny how that is, but anyways...  However,  those mistakes,  those shortcomings are NOT the faith.  The Catholic church doesn't teach those things.  Any mature person can realize that.  In SOME cases the Catholic church is a victim too.. a victim of how some Priests have taken advantage of their position.  That sort of thing happens in Government all the time.     However,  The Catholic church has 1 thing that no other Christian religion has. -- A direct link back to the Apostles who knew Christ. A Historic link, backed up by verifiable historical documents.  What the Catholic church teaches has not changed since the 1st century..since the 1st Christians. The core doctrines of the Catholic church are what the Apostles taught because it was the APOSTLES which started the church. -- That is where the historic documents come in. -- they prove that what we DID believe is what we STILL believe.      ALL other denominations and groups broke off from Catholicism and therefore are parts of this faith but are not ALL of it.  This is why the Catholic church calls itself the "Fullness" of the faith.  It realizes that OTHER denominations have truth and validity.. but only a fraction of what the Catholic has.  They are not FULL.  They broke that historic link back to the Apostles and what they taught.  The Catholic church states it as other faiths are "not in full communion with the Christ's church" -- that is to say, they recognize that they are some what in union or agreeance..but just not FULLY.     All of the faiths which came later, generally in the last couple of hundred years,  break their connection with the original christians.  Thru various justifications, they will claim to be following the "TRUE" spirit of what the Apostles taught..but the fact remains they break with the continuity of the Faith and there beliefs came MUCH after those of the ORIGINAL Christians.    I am not an expert on the JW faith.  I know they have some quasi-godlike beliefs where we can become LIKE gods ourselves. -- The Catholic church DOES NOT believe this.     However, I know first hand that they can be VERY persuasive and many of their beliefs seem innocent on the service.  They are good people and mean well.    Pope Benedict's own Cousin is JW and he acknowledges that their missionary work is good and they are not bad people. He doesn't try to use his position as Pope to "convert" his cousin.  She was the FIRST person he called on the telephone after being confirmed as Pope. -- So he loves her dearly even though she is of a different religion.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	Wow that is an interesting combination.  First, as a Catholic without getting approval from a bishop (with intent to go and to preach the truth) you are not allowed to go to a Protestant Service or Cult for this matter.  You are within the Church that Christ Himself established.  God decreed "One Lord, one faith, on baptism" (Eph. 4, 5).  One Faith means one doctrine, the doctrine of Christ.  A doctrine outside of the Roman Catholic Doctrine is false.  Do not jeopardizes your soul to please man, we are here to please God and God alone, why would you want to attend a cult that believes in lies?    Before you truly decide to do anything I recommend that you read this article: http://www.olrl.org/stories/wizclip.shtm... | A true story of a family conversion, and the illuminating instructions they received about the Catholic Faith for 17 years. A most interesting story.    There are however exceptions: First Active Participation in non-Catholic services is forbidden (C. 1258).  The Natural Law forbids participation in services that are heretical.  It is forbidden to ask a heretic to baptize, to be a sponsor for a non-Catholic (even by proxy).  It is forbidden to sing, play the organ or other instruments in the religious service.Private prayer and song is okay provided they are not heretical.    Whoever acts contrary to the prescription of C. 1258 and takes part in non-Catholic services is suspected to heresy (C. 2316).    Passive Attendance at non-Catholic services is allowed for a good reason, e.g., due to one's position or for politeness (Marriage, or Funeral service), provided that the danger of perversion and scandal is precluded (C. 1258).  Passive Assistance implies that no part in praying, singing, etc.  Under these restrictions it is permissible to attend a heretical Baptism, a marriage or funeral serves conducted in a non-Catholic church.|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	learn about Jehovah's witnesses, learn what they believe and make them prove it to your from the bible. you'll be surprised that they get all of their beliefs from the bible. after learning all  you can then make your decision. i hoped i helped. take care.|`|VIFxtHdPaa	Just go to church with them.

It would be fine to have a fruit bowl somewhere in the kitchen or dining area, and be sure to show them where the snacks are, and how to get ice and anything else in the refrigerator.

A small clock and a tissue box on the night stand next to the bed, and put a wastebasket in the room. A chair to sit in and maybe some magazines would be a nice touch, also.

YapMABSfaa	"Aztec Population    It is said that the Aztecs came from Aztlan which was a place that literally means the place of origin. Some historians believe that Aztlan is a place somewhere near the Valley of Mexico, while some believe that it is a place that doesnt really exist or is mythical. Although the place of origin of the Mexica or the Aztecs is not known for sure, it is positive that the Aztecs settled in the Valley of Mexico around the middle of the 13th century and this is when the Aztec population started to grow.         The Growth Of Aztec Population    At first, the Mexica or the Aztecs were not as many as the other tribes. They were considered to be the new kids on the block and they got the worst place to live in. But this didnt stop them from growing and thriving as a great civilization and highly known empire.     With the help of two other groups, the triple alliance became the most popular group in the Valley of Mexico. By the time the Spaniards came, the Aztecs population was already a very numerous one. Although their exact population always varied because of the quite big impact that human sacrifices to the gods made on their numbers.     At about 1519, the Aztecs were about 25,000,000 in number. They were plenty, thriving and they dominated the area. But when the Spaniards came, not only did the Spaniards kill a lot of the Aztecs, but they also brought with them many diseases.         The Decline Of Aztec Population    Many Aztec people died because of the small pox. By the year 1538, the Aztec population really declined. The remaining Aztecs had a total population of about 6 million only. By the year 1580, the Aztecs numbers really spiraled downwards; there were only about 2 million Aztecs left.     Some of the diseases the Spaniards brought included mumps, tuberculosis, typhus and measles. Aztecs didnt have the right medicine for these diseases nor were they resistant to them, since the diseases were new. They probably didnt even know what these sicknesses were. So although the Aztec empire crumbled when it was defeated by Spaniards it ware the diseases that caused the decline of the Aztec population.         Aztec People Today    Modern Aztecs or the descendants of the Aztecs now live in or near Mexico City. Mexico City is after all where the original Aztecs lived, although before, the city was called Tenochtitlan. Modern Mexico now stands on what was before Tenochtitlan.    The modern Aztecs of today number well over a million and they are now the largest aboriginal group in Mexico. These modern day Aztecs are usually illiterate farmers who are somehow different from the other Mexicans whose culture is very modern compared to the Aztecs.    These modern day Aztecs still retain their way of speaking and they use the Aztec-Nahua language. Their religion however is different and can be described as a mix of Aztec religion and Roman Catholicism.     There are still many places in Mexico City that showcases the artworks or the majesty of the once thriving Aztecs. Theres even a statue in Mexico city depicting the Aztecs. They are certainly few in number now but surely, Aztec population and their empire will not and can never be forgotten."|`|3cLA6wCWaa	Virgin sacrifices.|`|4Za1utmCaa	Rent and watch that Mel Gibson movie Apocolypto and you will have your answer.

f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	In the Hindu Religion, the trinity represents the Divine in its threefold nature. Each aspect of the trinity contains and includes the others.          Almost all of the thousands of different Hindu Gods can be traced back to these 3 main ones that make up the Hindu Holy Trinity.    Brahma -  Creator    Vishnu -    Preserver      Incarnated on earth as Krishna    Shiva -      The destroyer        I don't think there is a lot of similarity between them and the Christian Holy Trinity.    Although maybe the idea got borrowed.|`|G7uWSutFaa	The Hindu concept of Brahman is completely different.   As per the Vedas, Brahman is the origin and end of all things, the root cause of everything. It is eternal and infinite, and is the only truth. Brahman is described as unknowable, because it is beyond our comprehension. It has no shape or form, and no attributes. The multitude of Hindu Gods and Goddesses are described as different manifestations of the one Brahman. For example, the trinity of Brahma(different from Brahman), Vishnu and Siva are have been attributed with functions of creation, sustenance and destruction respectively. But in the final analysis, there is only Brahman. The goal of the Hindu is to realize this truth - to know Brahman by realizing that Brahman is within us.  The Hindu view is that "All paths lead to the one Truth, though many people call upon it by different names." Now you may understand why Hindus are not interested in conversion.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	You've got Hinduism wrong.

ALL that the gospels report of what Jesus said, in private and in public, he could have uttered in two hours, wrote Bible translator Edgar Goodspeed. Yet that little was so stirring, so moving and so penetrating that it is safe to say nobody else has influenced the world so much.    When Jesus Christ completed his earthly ministry in the year 33 C.E., his followers numbered at least some 120 men and women. (Acts 1:15) Today, more than two billion people claim to be Christians. Hundreds of millions more recognize Jesus as a prophet. His teachings have indeed had an extraordinary influence on mankind.    Jesus worldwide influence has been acknowledged even by non-Christian leaders. For example, Jewish rabbi Hyman Enelow wrote: Jesus has become the most popular, the most studied, the most influential figure in the religious history of mankind. Enelow also stated: Who can compute all that Jesus has meant to humanity? The love he has inspired, the solace he has given, the good he has engendered, the hope and joy he has kindledall that is unequalled in human history. Among the great and the good that the human race has produced, none has even approached Jesus in universality of appeal and sway. He has become the most fascinating figure in history. And Hindu leader Mohandas K. Gandhi said: I know of no one who has done more for humanity than Jesus. In fact, there is nothing wrong with Christianity. However, he added: The trouble is with you Christians. You do not begin to live up to your own teachings.    Nobody else has influenced the world so much.Edgar Goodspeed      What Influence  Does Jesus Christ  Have on You?         IN VIEW of what we considered in the preceding article, can there be any doubt that Jesus teachings have had a worldwide impact? The question of importance, though, is, What influence do Jesus teachings have on me personally?    Jesus teachings touched on a vast array of subjects. The valuable lessons they convey can affect every aspect of your life. Let us focus on what Jesus taught about setting priorities in life, cultivating friendship with God, establishing good relationships with others, solving problems, and refraining from acts of violence.  Set Priorities in Life    The fast-paced world of today makes so many demands on our time and energies that spiritual considerations often get crowded out. Consider the case of a man in his 20s whom we will call Jerry. While Jerry enjoys conversations on spiritual subjects and values what he learns from them, he laments: I just do not have the time to engage in them consistently. I work six days a week. Sunday is my only day off. And after I take care of the things I must do, I am too tired. If you find yourself in a similar predicament, you can benefit from what Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount.    Jesus said to the crowd who had gathered to hear him: Stop being anxious about your souls as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. Does not the soul mean more than food and the body than clothing? Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? . . . So never be anxious and say, What are we to eat? or, What are we to drink? or, What are we to put on? For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. (Matthew 6:25-33) What do we learn from this?

rrWAhJV5aa	Yes Mercy Ministries is a cult. They peddle themselves as a Christian organisation but that's very far from the truth, and unfortunately that's how many young women get suckered in.     The staff aren't qualified and the philosophy taught there is that there is no such thing as psychiatric illness. They teach young women that demons are controlling them and that illnesses are the consequences of the sins of their ancestors. They are also big on teaching that demons live inside people who have psychiatric illness and exorcism is a very large part of their program.    The government in Australia is currently investigating Mercy Ministries when more than 1/3 of their former Australian residents came forward to report abuse and negligence while they were in the program. One of the two Australian homes has already been shut down. Mercy   Ministries staff were caught out lying about the methods they use and admitted to their misleading statements after they were caught out (one of the many exorcism books used was produced to the media.)    This orgaisation is one to stay away from if your friend needs real help or treatment. She would be better off going to a qualified doctor or counsellor. If she's a Christian, suggest that she finds a Christian counselling service in her area where the counselors have real degrees, and show her all the news stories.|`|vuAD59egaa	Did you know that mercy has to do with compassion.

The Founder is a woman called Nancy Alcorn - who I have heard speak - and she is TOTALLY committed to helping girls between the age of approx 16-25 be set frree from life controlling issues.  I actually support the charity in England and my mother in law knows Marianna Walker who heads up the Mercy Ministries home in England.    I would recommend you read Echoes of Mercy -  Nancy Alcorn's personal testimony of how God has blessed this ministry and how it all started. the isbn is 1-577-94619-7.    Nancy is a really humble woman.  Once you start to read the book you wont be able to put it down and you will find 100% reassurance that your friend is in very safe hands.      In which country does friend reside as there are several mercy residential homes in the world?   God promised to bless Nancy's ministry giving her 3 conditions - that she must not charge girls who stay there, that she never forget to tithe and that she must not accept state funding.....and through her obedience many  many girls lives have been transformed.    The website in uk is www.mercyministries.co.uk.  But I am sure if you google Nancy Alcorn and/or mercy ministries you will find plenty of information.    All the best to your friend.  God bless you and her, and may she be set free.|`|AA11407043	There is no universally accepted definition of a cult.

And MM has cropped up on the cult education forum run by renowned cult expert Rick Ross:    http://forum.rickross.com/read.php?12,55...    The Sydney Morning Herald has run a series of articles on MM.  Here is another:    http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/they...    An MM survivors group can be found here:    http://www.mercysurvivors.com    MM stands accused of:  -Using exorcism as a method of treatment  -Having a fixation about homosexuality  girls cant even get changed in the same room  -Using unqualified staff  -Lying about the services offered  -Restricting access to doctors and other professionals  -Throwing out vulnerable and suicidal clients with no warning, no aftercare and nowhere to go when their bizarre treatment doesnt work  -Claiming to be a free service but taking their clients social security money  -Lying about their success rate  -Using dirty tricks against their detractors    I have a copy of their residents handbook, which lays out their rules.  MM sounds little better than prison.  I can send you a copy if you like.  Some of their actions could be charitably put down as taking their religion a little too far but the lying and dirty tricks look distinctly unchristian.

That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.     The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.     Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.|`|Op81lhjuaa	When will the World End?

I told her I had, and she then asked, "Do you realize what it's about???"  When I said that I did indeed, she turned beet red.  What a hoot!    EDIT  2:  It is not a sin to waste sperm.

Q4MqzxX7aa	you're an idiot.    If you ask a stupid "question" you'll get stupid answers|`|Op81lhjuaa	You are right. Logic cannot just come from nothing.    think about this:    Have you ever just looked around and wondered how things are so wonderfully made? Did everything just happen by chance?     ? If there is a Creation then there has to be a Creator.    The fact that we exist as a creation proves that we had to have been created by a creator. If there were a robot that looked and acted like a human at your house it would be an insult to tell you that it just happened by chance. You would already have known that it had to have been created by a creator.    ? If there is a Design then there has to be a Designer.     The design of human body is so complex that the body proves there has to be a designer. If someone told you that your car in the driveway just happened by chance and had no thought or design you would be insulted by that person. The very fact that the human body and the car are designed proves that they did not happen by chance but had to have had a designer.    ? If there is Art then there has to be an Artist.     Have you ever just looked at a sunset and wondered who painted it in the sky? The very fact that there is art in all of creation is proof there is an artist. Take a look at a painting at a museum, would you believe someone that said it just painted itself? It is impossible for a detailed work of art to just happen by chance.    ? If there is Order then there is an Orderer.    There very fact that you know what is right and wrong in your heart proves that someone had to have made you that way. If you go to any state in the USA you will find law and order in that state. Would you just come to the conclusion that that law just happened by chance or someone had to have made and put that law into affect?    The very fact that there is creation, design, art, and order proves that there is a Creator, Designer, Artist, and Orderer. Now that we know without a doubt that there is a God we need to find out what He wants.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Perhaps you should try to understand what logic is and what it is used for, and then you will understand why your first statement is not correct.|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	Logic is found through truth, but truth is not necessarily defined in God.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Logic works for me.

It does not follow that because truth exists, that god must exist.      Your series of statements, "there is no god greater then the truth, and god is truth, so the truth is god," are trivial, meaning they say nothing at all.  They are also what is called ipse dixit: asserted without justification and assumed to be true without justification.

In this country many well educated Muslim women are doctors, etc. Many women in Arab and other Islamic countries are well educated.

I don't know what brings out the kind of ignorance there is in some places. But even in Europe and America in the 19th and even parts of the 20th century girls sometimes got little or no education.    Americans also did not let Black people have education in the time of slavery, a white person could go to prison for teaching a Black person to read and write. It was to keep them down.

EBGdlo35aa	Well, that's sort of like asking, "what's the difference between a corvette and all other chevys?"  Naturally, there are differences between the JB and the KJV.  There are a *different* set of differences between the JB and the NIV!  So, your question doesn't give us anything solid to compare and contrast with the JB.    That being said, here are some things about the JB that are *not* common in *most* English bibles....    1) the tetragrammaton is translterated as "Yahweh".  Most English bibles use the phrase "the Lord".  (This is a good thing - see a full explanation of why  http://bible-reviews.com/accuracytetragr...  2) it includes the entire Roman Catholic canon.  Many bibles only include the "minimal canon" of 66 books.  The JB includes all of the Scriptures that were included in the earliest bibles.  You can read about these "extra" Scriptures here under "Roman Catholic Deuterocanon"  http://www.bible-reviews.com/charts_scri...  3) The first English translation to put poetic passages (poetry in Hebrew) in stanza form  4) Although largely translated from the original languages, large portions were translated from the French and then checked against the original language - an approach not approved by most translators.  5) It is a bible produced by Roman Catholics under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.      Frankly, I think you would be better off with the New Jerusalem Bible, which not only has all the "pros" of the JB but also is translated entirely from the original languages and takes advantage of improvements in scholarship and source texts that happened in the 20 years between translations.    This should be of some help  http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector.ht...    Feel free to email me with more questions.    Jim|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The Jerusalem Bible is simply another, although highly regarded, translation of the bible.  edit  Further review indicates that it is the first Roman Catholic English language edition of the bible to be translated from texts in the original languages rather than the Latin Vulgate.|`|ucuP0boCaa	Better salesmen.|`|R5MXZ9FFaa	Same lies, different language.|`|ulmKkjbXaa	Nothing beats the King James.

I like the RSV-CE.  it has the best translations.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	I use a New Jerusalem Bible which is a revised edition of the Jerusalem Bible. It is extremely good in my opinion. It is a Roman catholic translation, although I cannot detect any bias. It's not a literal translation in the sense that if you translate literally it can be hard to read, but it doesn't get too loose as some translartions do; in my opinion it does seem to pick up the meaning better than many translations (I'm speaking of the New Jerusalem Bible).    I use other bibles as well, so if I suspect the meaning is not being put quite right in one I can check with the others. For a very literal translation I read the New American Standard Bible, which is however not very elegant.|`|AC7Qp4Wqaa	The Quran is only one Quran, whilst there are so many different versions of the bible.

ygGr1nX7aa	The bottom line is that everyone differs in their individual beliefs, even within a religious organisation.  Among other reasons, some feel that loyalty to one's family, community, and country should be the primary consideration in a time of war.

Think of the priests who have fiddled with children, the muslims who bomb people....and the christians who go to war and kill. None of these people are just and they are not Christian. It is a sin to kill, it is one of the ten commandments, 'thou shalt not kill' it doesnt say 'thou shalt not kill but if u really have to u can' ......and everyone stuck to that rule then there wouldnt be any wars, ever. The only religion and group of Christians who seem to adhere to that and you will never see them picking up a weapon and going to war are Jehova's Witnesses.|`|7e83d02aea426afae2358c95ac7592daaa	many people believe in a just war not just Christians the only ones who don't believe in just wars are pacifist|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Because some are their own theologians (and, yes, that is an insult) and some take the teaching authority of the Church.

AA10052130	Context!    At the begining of the previous chapter, Paul makes his position exceedingly clear:  Romans 6:1-2 -- What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?  Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?    What Paul is explaining in ch. 7 is that sin continues in our lives even with all our efforts to eradicate it and live by the law of God.  And we must have faith in the loving mercy of God to strengthen us and save us from "this body of death."    Paul shows that in the spirit led mind, Christians strive to obey the good and perfect law of God -- the law that teaches us what sin is:  Verse 12 -- Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.  Verse 7 -- ... I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."    We Christians delight in the good and perfect law of God, and strive to follow it.  We want to do right and good, but we keep finding sin in our lives, keep doing what is wrong according to the law of God and against the good that we want to do:  Verse 22 -- For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man.  Verse 19 -- For the good that I will to do, I do not do;    So, no, this chapter does not justify sin, it condemns it.  But it does teach us the mercy of God at giving us grace and forgiveness for where we are weak:  Verse 24 -- O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?  Verse 25 -- I thank God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! ...  .|`|AA11476749	Romans 6:1 seems to say "no" to your question.  "What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?"|`|fOfJz9OMaa	No, not at all; rather the Spirit speaking through Paul is giving us to understand that we of our own selves cannot overcome sin with out God in our lives.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.      9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.    10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.    sinful.    14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.    NO !!!!!    sin is not justifiable.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Paul is saying that though he doesn't want to sin, he still does.      All saved believers are still sinners.  So anyone that comes to you and says you must "turn from sins" to be saved, is a liar.  Ask them if they are in sinless perfection, and when they say "no", then show them that by their own false theology, that they're not saved.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	It does not justify sin.

IMSkR8Ajaa	Well, I am a Baptist, and I am member of PETA...that is "People Eating Tasty Animals"|`|Op81lhjuaa	What about different denominations?    The reason there are different denominations within Christianity is because the Bible allows for us to have differences of opinions. Within Christianity there are very few essential doctrines that define what it means to be a Christian. These essential doctrines are,       1. Jesus is both God and man (John 1:1,14; 8:24; Col. 2:9; 1 John 4:1-4).     2. Jesus rose from the dead physically (John 2:19-21; 1 Cor. 15:14).     3. Salvation is by grace through faith (Rom. 5:1; Eph. 2:8-9; Gal. 3:1-2; 5:1-4).     4. The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus (1 Cor. 15:1-4; Gal. 1:8-9).     5. There is only one God (Exodus 20:3; Isaiah 43:10; 44:6,8).     6. God exists as a Trinity of persons:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (See Trinity).     7. Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary (nature of incarnation)    As long as a church believes in these essential doctrines, then it is Christian. However, there are many things in the scriptures that have been interpreted in different ways. For example, what day of the week should be worship on, Saturday or Sunday? Should we baptize by sprinkling or baptize by immersion? Do we take communion every Sunday, once a month, or once a year? The answers to these questions do not affect whether or not someone is a Christian. It is in these issues, and others like them, that denominations are formed. It does not mean that one denomination contradicts another. It means that though they agree in the essentials, they differ in some nonessentials. This is permitted in Scripture:        "Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions. 2 One man has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only. 3 Let not him who eats regard with contempt him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him. 4 Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and stand he will, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 5 One man regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind," (Rom. 14:1-5).     Sadly, there is another reason for denominational differences and that is the failure of Christians to live according to the will of God. The truth is that we are all sinners and we do not see things eye to eye. It is an unfortunate truth that denominational differences are due to our shortsightedness and lack of love. But, the good thing is that God loves us so much that He puts up with our failures. There waits for us, in spite of our differences, a great reward in heaven. Neither salvation nor damnation is dependent upon our differences.  Our salvation is based on our relationship with Christ.|`|ulmKkjbXaa	Different denominations, different teachings.

vEEeq7kYaa	As RJ correctly noted there is no single Jewish culture or ethnicity.  Many different and distinctly Jewish cultures and ethnicities have developed over the millennia in Diaspora lands. The Diaspora refers to the Jewish presence outside of Israel after the destruction of the First and Second Temple periods and the Bar Kochba revolt.     There is no ONE Jewish ethnicity, but a great many ethnicities that are distinctly Jewish. There are the Mizrahi (from the Middle East and North Africa).The Sephardi (Spanish) and the Ashkenazi, (German, Polish, Russian and other Eastern European)that are all slightly different, even within those three designations as to cultural practices and foods, but it is the faith and covenant that binds them all together as Klal Yisrael.     The Jewish nation began as a group of tribes and our connection to one another is still from the perspective of a tribal nation. ( example:as the Lakota nation has tribal procedure and law to determine who is a memberof their tribe, who is not, who is expelled and who is adopted, so does Judaism.)    There are many Jewish ethnicities and more than one Jewish language.    Here is a site that may help you explore someof the different Jewish cultures through language ( and maybe there will be links to discover non verbal behaviors there, too? )      I'm a "southern Jew"..on my maternal side my ancestry is both Sephardi and Ashkenazi and my grandmother came here almost a hundred years ago. ( Spanish and German ancestry)    My father's side is Ashkenazi from Russia and their ancestry goes back to Italy in the middle ages.     My parents were both born and raised in the Southern U.S.    the "New York" Jewish mannerisms that are so stereotyped on TV I sometimes think are as as foreign to Southern Jews in the U.S. as  the native Sabra's mannerisms would be to any Jew born and raised in the U.S.    The only thing I really notice in difference between the southern Jewish folk I know ( widely scattered and small in numbers) and other non-Jewish southerners, is that we're more huggy people ..or maybe that's just my own extended family...who knows? But we hug..men aren't afraid to hug their brothers, adult sons, cousins, nephews, etc. And this includes the Orthodox among us. The custom I've seen among some Orthodox that men and women don't touch..I never knew in my extended family. I hugged my uncles and cousins ..men and women who are Orthodox and they hugged me.    My husband was the one that pointed out when he first came to the Reform synagogue ( he isn't Jewish) that he'd never seen such touchy feely people before! I never thought of us that way until he said it.    so ...maybe it isn't just my family, either.    yet..as RJ also noted..there is often overlapping.    NU?    Shalom y'all!  :)    (((HUG))) lol|`|AsyB1qLyaa	Talk to some Jews face to face and find out.|`|NI0cNU22aa	You could write a whole paper on "nu" and the various meanings it can take on depending on the context of the conversation, the facial expressions, and the hand gestures.    Also, you should be aware that even though there are certain things that many Jews have in common, "Jewish" is not a homogenous cultural group. There are Eastern European and Western European Jews, Ashkenazi and Sephardi, American Jews (usually secular), Arab Jews, Persian Jews, and that the behavior of each community is influenced by the geographical boundaries of their ancestors. Israeli Jews, largely the product of years of intermarriage between ethnic groups, are also different - so I think you should first specify which Jewish community you're most interested in.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	LOL at "nu" - that's so true!    I've been racking my brains over this question since I saw it last night, trying to come up with any examples.  While most Jews talk with our hands, we really don't have a huge tradition of nonverbal communication.  Wordplay is actually a huge part of the Talmud, and Yiddish was always an inventive language, rich in humorous usage.  Jewish literacy was also always extremely high, so most of our nonverbal communication was in writing.  We have a very high verbal tradition.     The only things I could think of are the "thumb dip" which some religious men use when discussing the Talmud - it's sort of a sweeping gesture with your thumb to indicate that the argument is taking a new direction, or going deeper into interpretation - and gestures that take place during prayer (which are not a form of communication) such as shuckling (rocking back and forth while praying as a way of increasing concentration) and the special way that Cohanim hold up their hands during the "priestly blessing" (which we are not allowed to actually look at, so they keep their hands covered while doing it, but is basically both hands doing Spock's 'live long and prosper' gesture).  The final thing I could think of goes with "nu" - the clop on the table.  There are occasionally times when we are not allowed to speak to one another - between ritual handwashing and the prayer over bread at the beginning of the meal, or during prayer services, and often someone either does not know or is lagging behind in joining everyone else in silence.  When this happens, someone will invariably slap or knock on the table to indicate their displeasure, usually with a huge "NU?!" or grunt showing annoyance far out of proportion to the actual offense ;)    All in all, though, I really don't think Jews are big nonverbal communicators.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Well first of all, there is not a "jewish culture" but many jewish cultures, and sometimes one culture varies significantly from another.    In the US, orthodox jews will not...or are not supposed to anyway, touch a person of the opposite sex unless it is to save a life or prevent injury.    Different types of jews will also dress different ways, wrap tefilin different ways. Some hang mezuzahs on their doors, some don't.    What you might want to do is to divide your paper into four major parts. Ashkenazim, Sephardim, Mizrahim, and lesser known groups such as Karaites, Ethiopean and Indian jews, and then within those groups discuss the various subgroups and contrast and compare.    You have a very big task!

It it, as my dad used to say, physically possible but highly improbable.    You need a degree or 10 - 50 years of expereince.    Developing countries don't need high school graduates. They have plenty of their own. You'd just be taking a job from a local citizen. What they need are college graduates willing to work in an upriver school or a back country clinic. Local college graduates, just like ours, tend to want to work in big cities, where there is something to do at night, a large pool of single people, major league sports, symphony and shopping, etc. etc.|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	The minimum requirements for Peace Corps are:     18 years of age or older      U.S. citizenship         A four-year college degree, or solid work experience in an area such as agriculture, business management, or a skilled trade. A community college degree paired with specific skills or work experience may also qualify you.      If you don't meet these requirements then no you can't join Peace Corps. Lots of other volenteer groups around though.

But the thing is if you DO go right after high school, you may get a job offer and will never go back to college.So it might be better with a little more experience and college, then join the peace corps and have a chance of getting job offers.|`|2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	Sarah, you have a very laudable goal.  But, as a current Peace Corps volunteer, you really need the work experience, life experience, and education before you come over here.  Work experience is the one thing that really hurts a lot of the volunteers who are fresh out of college.  Oftentimes, they are asked to work in a business environment and know how an office runs, but have never actually done that themselves.  Life experiences are also very important, as you would be living by yourself in a small town or village, with no other Americans usually, and with very few if any other people speaking English.  You have to be able to rely on yourself.  Finally, education is important because a lot of what a Peace Corps volunteer does is related to teaching--be it English, life skills (AIDS awareness, non-smoking, etc...), computer skills, and so on.  The best thing you could do is either work or buckle down and go to college first, gain the experience and insight that you will need later, and then consider the Peace Corps again.  It is a hard job, but extremely rewarding!  Also, try to gain some volunteer experience on the local level first to find out if you really enjoy it--maybe help teach English to immigrants or something.  Good luck!

1TYZDRUqaa	The Gregorian Calendar has become the internationally accepted civil calendar." It was first proposed by the Calabrian doctor Aloysius Lilius, and decreed by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom it was named, on 24 February 1582 by the papal bull Inter gravissimas.    It is a reform of the Julian calendar and continues the year numbering system of the Julian calendar, counting years from the traditional Incarnation of Jesus. Years after this date are given the designation "anno Domini" (AD),or "Common Era" (CE); years before this date are labeled "before Christ" (BC), or "Before the Common Era" (BCE).    The Gregorian calendar modifies the Julian calendar's regular four-year cycle of leap years as follows:    Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100; the centurial years that are exactly divisible by 400 are still leap years. For example, the year 1900 is not a leap year; the year 2000 is a leap year.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	There is no "Christian calendar"    We currently use the Gregorian (Pope Gregory - Roman) pagan calendar. It is replete with errors. One year they had 444 days. The months July and August were added by JULIUS and AUGUSTUS Caesar. How vain!    There is absolutely NO WAY to determine with reliability which year this is! According to the Hebrew (lunar) calendar, it is 5769 now.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	The Christian calendar consists of the fixed and movable feasts of the Church, and has nothing to do with BC and AD.|`|sebhK7r7aa	It's actually called the Gregorian Calendar, not the Christian Calendar|`|JJAodx30aa	I hate calenders and clocks!|`|0yPfYLEFaa	Origin of Year 0 and AD, BC     Counting years according to our modern system was suggested by the monk Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century and more commonly adopted in the 9th century.    Before that, Christianity counted years by the reign of the Roman emperor, or according to the biblically-calculated time since Adam, or Anno Mundi (AM). The AM count was based upon biblical passages. In particular, it used a 12 hour analogy, with Jesus appearing at the 11th hour. Unfortunately, this calendar had the world coming to an end around 500 AD.     Dionysius proposed an alternative calendar that set the year 0 to Christ's incarnation upon the world based upon the history available to him, and to the beginning of the age of Pisces (where new years began with the sun in the constellation of Pisces). Pisces, the sign of the fish, was linked to the first Christian symbol, ICHTHYS (i.e., fish in Latinised Greek). It also made the end of the age of Pisces occur close to an auspicious alignment of the 5 major planets in 2003.|`|R5MW3BSsaa	uhhh don't get it!
GM0kOZpRaa	not haram to have freinds,  so be freinds  then ask for marrige later but stay connected or something.  it's just like the sexual stuff before marrige being haram.  ( i think physical might be haram too)    heres some tips for you:    -Just hang out   -maybe you can get some freinds and hang out with her and you can get to know each other.    Just don't do anything that will lead to sexual stuff.      BUt to get you started, ummm maybe you can like....... if she has a phone(it's easier to say stuff in text sometimes) just text her or something and say that dating is limited in your religion but you want to date her.    But you should know that sometimes "dating" includes breaking up and getting back together and all this stuff so good luck|`|rdoPeWnzaa	Do a group thing or something. Bring a bunch of your friends, and she could bring a bunch of her friends, and you could all hang out or something.|`|CwqW45Rmaa	With all due respect to everyone's beliefs, why is it so normal for you Muslim folk here on Yahoo Answers to say things such as " Get to know her more,"...etc... That's not right, here's why.    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: What is the ruling on correspondence between young men and women, even if this correspondence is free from immorality and love?     He replied:     It is not permissible for any man to correspond with a woman who is not his mahram, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in that. A person may think that there is no fitnah, but the Shaytaan will keep trying until he tempts him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded those who heard of the Dajjaal to keep away from him, and said that a man may approach him as a believer, but the Dajjaal will keep trying until he leads him astray.     Undoubtedly correspondence such as seeing each other personally is more dangerous than correspondence by chatting or emailing, but both are bad.         Speaking with a woman to whom one is not related (i.e., not mahram) should only be for a specific need, such as asking a question, buying or selling, asking about the head of the household, and so on. Such conversations should be brief, with nothing doubtful in either what is said or how it is said.           Conclusion: Getting to know her personally, hanging out, talking online, etc...is not right. Unless you plan to talk about Islam...  I advise you to have a sister or mother get to know the girl, see if she's right for you, if that's what you're trying to figure out.|`|kjUqJLyKaa	if you are really certain that u are gonna marry her, then u may go together in a public place but you MUST have someone with you at all times. you cannot be alone. but they dont hafta be like listening or anything just ilke a few feet behind u just watching. Salam|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,    she'll respect your believes if she likes you.....  ....what's her religion?    Peace.|`|pzMsRJsjaa	get her msn and chat to her thru a web cam  it's sorta like a date|`|sna0p2djaa	Dude,    First of all, this lady could never marry you b/c your not Muslim.    EDIT: Well, If you are Muslim..shouldn't you know that dating is haram and if you'd like to marry this lady you could ask ur parents to ask her parents about this chick.. If you wanna know her, you could possibly go somewhere with a mehram|`|AA11176279	you can "date" her.. if you're not too conservative.    just go out to dinner in a public place and get to know her... do this a few times and if you really really like her, then ask her about her future plans and stuff. also, if you're not too conservative, i guess it'd be ok to hang out with her at home or something, as long as you guys dont have sex. lol...     then i guess the next step is to tell your parents and ask hers if its alright.     good luck!!|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	You may date her, after you get to know her family, and usually they will always want someone with her as a 3rd at the least.    If she is in a good Muslim home then she is surrounded all the time with everyone. Not to have information on each other, but to keep care of each other so they themselves can know they are not alone.    As for that relationship it takes a good man to enter there, and well the rest is as you can figure out as simple as your own experiences.    As for finding a wife, you will have to find yourself before he will send her to you.|`|ZE6RWhk4aa	Well, if she's also Muslim (and you have a reason for liking her besides looks), you could always just tell her, Salaam, want to get to know each other with a view towards marriage? Then you could talk to each other and spend halal time together (e.g., not at the back of a cinema!), both knowing what you are looking for. If she isn't Muslim, it could be more difficult. But stick to your principles, as they're right. what woman could respect a man who won't. What man who won't deserves to be respected?|`|7y97lpE5aa	you could always leave islam..      ouch, you guys are haters|`|0wSHIUB2aa	Tell her and see what she sais!She isnt there anymore She is HERE.|`|MhrzhEncaa	u go on a "date" only take someone with you who will be far away and can see you 2, but not hear u
FKxrJxbPaa	lol    ima take a shot    A) maybe African..im about 75% sure  B) Black American  C) African  D) either or...not sure bout that 1      lol then in that case ima say Black American|`|SBF6jqlLaa	A) a beautiful African sis    B) a fine African American brother     C) an African brother     D) a beautifiul African American sis    add: C looks Somalian to me....D- something about her eyes...she looks African American to me.(she has that neo-soul thing going on too- love her hair) I can't really pin point why- but it's in the eyes.   and WHO is that sexy B?    add: I think I know what it is about the eyes...i think West Africans have more of a slant to their eyes than most African Americans, who tend to have wider eyes. yeah, I might be onto something. LOL. both beautiful in my opinion.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	afrcan  african american   african  african american|`|8lNWNxmQaa	Not really. Blacks are really diverse. We all look different here and in Africa.|`|8RmazUuBaa	I think that was me who asked the question before..    African  American  Afrcan  American    In that order..    EDIT: I got it first, give me best answer...But the more I do these, the more I realize Black Americans (decended from colonal times) are truely a unique ethnic group. Its really easy to tell for me..|`|Cqtb3T5Xaa	I thought African Americans and Africans both originate from Africa. Isn't Africa a continent?  A,B,C,D all Africans|`|OZjlW5utaa	A African american  B African American  C African   D African    Yes mind2 big up ATL!|`|gHGtoqFIaa	first two african  second 2 american     i get that a lot...ppl always ask me am i nigerian and me and all my family that i know of was born in america but like what does african look like lol|`|jcK6EXpiaa	well, I can spot a Mandi man from a mile away, but I have to say, you've got me duped. hmmm..I am guessing the women are african, the men are african american. But I think the last woman sort of looks like my friend Conda, amd her sisters, who are from Liberia. She is actually mixed Zambian and african american, but was born there (in Liberia) because that's where a lot of former slaves moved after the american civil war...      edit: I think I can kind of see what cocoa means by the eyes...I can usually tell an african from the way they carry themselves, but with some people you can see it withthe eyes, like they don't apologise for their existence. Its like the difference between my high school sweet heart (an africa american) and my husband (a west african) Keith (my high school sweetie) had this air of anger about him, subtle, but present, like it is in the boys of my family (we're native) even though his true nature was sweet and shy. I saw it with his family too. With Dieru (my husband) he just never had that anger, that resentment, and you can see it in the way he carries himself. He never subconciously suspects that he is being watched, when an alarm goes off at a department store he doesn't get all panicky thinking he is the first one the security guard is going to inspect (like I do) he doesn't make a half concious effort to avoid eye contact with white people ( like I notice keith and I both did, his sister and Ihad a long talk about it) so yeah, I can kind of see where Cocoa is comming from in that perspective.|`|QTJhmClRaa	Even though you gave the answer already, I must say, I knew "C" was definitely not African American. He looks too exotic or something.  Most brothers around here don't have those type of east african features. All 4 people are very beautiful :)    EDIT    I see King of London! welcome back....|`|57oHulIDaa	one is african  two is african-american  three is african  four is african-american...|`|dZ0UhBfeaa	Generally, I could tell.    I think all of them are African except for the second one.  Big upp to K'naan, Somalia! lol    Edit: Then in that case I think the second one and the last one were born in America, and the first and the third in Africa.    The last one threw me off a little though, she could possibly be either. Can't exactly tell.|`|66PVkG9caa	i hear u lol...i actually cant.  i'm pure African. 100% and proud of it. but i've been called Caribbean, african american and so on and so forth|`|RDoFAwv1aa	A and C from the mothaaaland|`|MYnH6UKQaa	i cant tell at all :O but they arnt really showing much culture. my guess the bottom two african??  now i dont want to say african american cause i cant tell if they are african or african american! wwwhhhaatt!? this was interesting :]|`|ejo0CQkuaa	This is a hard one living in Atlanta I can't really tell. Their just African descent to me.|`|a67e803e96d3cbd46a381c3480f282afaa	A) A  B) A  C)AA  D)AA|`|AA12392755	Of course, Africans are people of all colors who live in Africa.    African-American is a made up designation for black people who are Americans, whether they have any connection with Africa or not.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	i'm terrible at guessing but here i go lol:   A)African  B)African American  C)African  D)African American|`|EmOnt7FIaa	A, is African (definately from western Africa)  B, is African American  C, is African (Probably from Ethiopia/Somalia and that region)  D,  is African American.    See, it is very easy to tell if somebody is African American or African. You can just tell where they came from by looking at their demeanor and little things in their facial expressions.    With A, i know she is African    With B, you can tell he he mostly black ancestry with some white (which is the case for most african american)    With C, he just looks Ethiopian, you can tell by the tin and Caucasian-like Bone Structure.    With D, same as B.
CiMaltLBaa	younger girls put on makeup to look years OLDER, however women put makeup on to look several yrs YOUNGER! How does that work?    Women are more self conscious then men are about their looks.  Men wear it for fashion, females for looks
WMyoUmTnaa	Despite the fact that you were hurt and mislead, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.  NO ONE NEEDED SOMEONE LIKE THAT IN THERE LIFE. If anything your computer did you a favor by backing down and allowing you to realize what other people's intentions are.  And what admiring about this situation is that you believed in your own ability to know that you are doing well for yourself in school.  No one understands sometimes why people choose what they choose, but they do, and it might be that they're unwilling to work as hard to achieve great results.  I thinking it's quite cowardly to mislead someone.  And it's a bad reflection off their own personality, not yours!  Continue the great work at school, and keep your eyes open because the rest of the world is full of people to take credit for someone else's work.  Good Luck!|`|AA11627889	I didn't think that she was taking advantage of you. I used to know people like that, I haven't been in your situation, but from what I can gather she was just busy and more interested in her partying. I mean I know it's a pain when you need something (like having something emailed to you, etc) and it doesn't happen, but I don't think she was taking advantage of you. Maybe (and I do this myself) you have high expectations of people? Or you assume that people should do or say something, because it's what you would say or do and when they don't deliver you get upset? Sorry. And after you sent that text, she's probably just angry!! Or doesn't know what to say.|`|MYnH6UKQaa	yeah its good you confronted her, wouldnt you see her in class and be able to say something though? if not, i guess you just have to wait for that reply. goodluck.|`|MCkz85Axaa	It doesn't sound like she was taking advantage of u at all.  She was out, partying and she doesn't have her notes with her at a friends house.   Also, you were kinda a ***** to say that she can't borrow your notes, if u have an A+ average then you obviously are good at it, and maybe she's not as good as u are. So she is just trying to pass the class, and because of u she probably won't no.  Way to go
lh8Tn02Naa	"The Bible stories" - this phrase suggests you have never actually read the Bible with any attention.    A good deal of it is quite manifestly history.  Told from a partisan point of view, OK, but no more inaccurate than Fox News.  There really were these kings, they fought their battles, begat their sons, even - rumor has it - daughters, when the Lord didn't feel like blessing them.    A good deal of it isn't narrative, so the question of whether it's legendary or factual doesn't arise.  This applies to most of the prophets, Paul's letters, Psalms, Proverbs and other writings.    That leaves other material which clearly is legendary.  The opening of Genesis, Jonah, the Elijah and Elisha sagas, the stories in Daniel, the virgin birth narratives, and so on.  Theologians have known this for centuries.  Some Christians don't know any theology and take refuge in conservative ideology which tells them that the Bible, being God's holy word and all that, can't contain anything erroneous, unworthy, or factually untrue.  As they grow up, they throw their blinkers away and realize what sort of writing the Bible actually is; sadly, many others never do grow up.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Urban Legends?  Have you researched the general similarities that most urban legends follow?  Separately, have you researched the critieria that myth and folklore follow?  It might be your opinion, but to people who study both folklore and urban legends,  Jewish and Christian Scripture simply don't fit the mold.     One of the main things in the way is Roman Historical Records. -- Romans kept good records and several historians from antiquity refer to these records. Sadly none survive today..but Josephius refers to them. Persian Historians refer to them and even the Empire Julian refers to them (different then Julius Caesar)   Jewish Historians, like the aforementioned Josephius  AND you forget the actual accounts of 1st Century Christians who KNEW what took place and didn't pass it along like urban legend but stone cold FACT.      We have their writings from the 1st century and those immediately after it.    If you are going to persist in your argument, then be prepared to state the SAME about many of our historical records.    For instance.. MUCH of what we know about the Roman Empire was written in the 2nd and 3rd Centuries AD -- hundreds if not thousands of years AFTER their events SUPPOSEDLY took place.     Many Egyptian accounts were written after the fact and even re-written to paint certain pharohs in better light.    We have way more evidence that historical accounts of Ancient governments were totally re-written to change the facts, after the fact  for political reasons, then we do of altering the biblical accounts of the NT.    Therefore, when you start to call the Bible an urban legend..you inadvertently start to call MOST historic documents from antiquity into questions as nothing more then urban legends or at most political commentary.    By contrast..when we compare Biblical copies and cross check them with outside sources they are VERY consistent.  MORE so then nearly any other historical account.    SO, they may appear to be urban legends to us NOW,  thousands of years later..but they were never presented as such, and they don't really fit the criteria for either folklore OR Urban Legends,  if you really research it. I mean other then the fact that they contain some fanatiscal things.  But besides that..they don't fit any of the criteria we use to label things as folklore or urban legends.|`|Dea2ZJyAaa	top answer is hilarious|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	Because there have been people pounding it into their heads since birth that it is real. If i told you since the day you were born that Snow White and the 7 dwarfs was the story of the creation of the universe you would believe it too|`|l8UaZ6iZaa	1)Fear of death gets them delusional and they start believing in an invisible man hoping they will have eternal life.Believing in the invisible dude forces you to believe his best-seller "the holy bible".  2)Peer pressure.Yep.Mommy,daddy,grandpa and the uncle who touches you in the naughty places.They all gave you the good old christian education.|`|wIoym87Yaa	I believe the answer is ....brainwashing from a very early age. They aren't allowed to look at these stories as Urban Legends. They have to accept them as "truth".  Now, you said "some Christians" so I am not referring to "all Christians". Some in here say the bible is written by the hand of God....(not true). All we get from the bible are "reports" by others of what God said or what Jesus said. Any of us now a days could go around writing "God told me to tell you ...whatever" and it would be just as valid as what you read in the bible.|`|HXuB6vB8aa	Because even though some is actual history, it's written by people. Not by god. It has the message of god, but every thing is not to be taken literally. The bible is something we're suppost to learn from, not harp over. I get sick of so many people twisting insignifigant bible verses to back up their ideas. For example, I think God is okay with homosexuality since he loves everyone, and that he wouldn't let people suffer through hell. Not everything is meant to be regarded as true word for word.|`|AA11668191	The odds of the Bible being true are much better than the odds of you having anything meaningful to say.|`|8Y583Fluaa	its not just Christians...muslums and jews believe in the old testament..they just dont believe Jesus was the Messiah..|`|eAMq1iBWaa	What makes you think that all history/science books are reliable? They were written by ordinary men, y'know?    The Bible is written by the hand of God. He tells us so!    Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?      ;-)|`|ki0tOVUYaa	low self-concepts underlay the felt need for a crutch|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Same reason as anybody, use of reason.

Also, the Bible has historically been taken much more seriously than any other book. It is the most well-attested book (as far as authenticity and validity) in the history of the world, with over 5,000 manuscripts found in different areas of the world all across the globe, each author having no knowledge of the others. It is, at the very least, a remarkable collection of books.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	In the book of Job God tells Job about there being something under the sea that was not discovered until 1975. Maybe when you have the time go read the book and find it for yourself as I don't have the time to find it right now..    Now how could anyone have know this prior to 1975 without submarines, underwater cameras?      It says right in the bible that people will say them came from a stone. Evolutions say it rained on the rocks for millions years. Which bubbled in the oceans and one day came one the shore and begot our ape fore fathers.    the bible was around long before the theory of evolution.

dcfce3e99b39f77803362d8f96deaa4faa	Personally, I bet it is paying off.  I used to live in Georgia and I felt really detached and alone because of the religious dominance there.  I don't think religious people will be convinced that there is no God, but closet atheists might get some comfort.|`|XxDQGEalaa	I don't know if it's 'paying off', but it certainly has it's place as well. It doesn't attack or insult any religion, it just lets those who don't believe in a god know that there are others who they can identify with.     Being in the minority, I'm sure persecution and hatred make it difficult to find support where they can explore their beliefs further.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	You're actually causing people to think more seriously about what they believe :)    Talking about God has a way of backfiring like that :)|`|opjgggqnaa	In reality it probably does little more than cheese off religious folks.

To sum it all, then there is more possibility than probability that no one is going to heaven from those allegations.  That is if there is Heaven and hell which to me was just created by the religion to put people in fear and prevent them from thinking freely which is only way I know how a man can use His Free Will to be happy. So, I will not totally go against what is being advertised because for me that is one of the ways to totally follow the song of Beatles "Imagine" and after that, we can start to really dig for reality from the lies created as truth.|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	I really hope so.

8TLj14KTaa	In an article by Andrew Sorkins,  Jonathan Simon states, "25 years is more than most people would get for rape or a non-aggravated murder."    I added a comma and moved the period at the end.  I would take out the stuff in parenthesis, if it was in the quote you need three dots like so:  In an article by Andrew Sorkins, Jonathan Simon states, "25 years... is more than most people would get for rape or a non-aggravated murder."    Also explain who Jon Simon is before quoting him so quickly, like so:  In an article by Andrew Sorkins, the attorney Jonathan Simon explains that white collar criminals receive an average, "25 years...[which] is more than most people would get for rape or a non-aggravated murder."    your welcome|`|Qo1g3Iu4aa	In Andrew Sorkins article, Mr. Jonathan Simon states, "twenty-five years, which is the sentence given to one white collar criminal, is more than most people would get for rape or a non-aggravated murder."

OTnSwNwZaa	Whites are still considered all of the positive things and Blacks are still unwanted all over the world. If you ask me, you have it better than I do when all I get to do is tell a few racist jokes...    Sure, there is a slight double standard (Black comedians can make fun of whites a tiny bit harsher than white comedians can make fun of Blacks), but truth be told, most whites laugh off Blacks that are racist since we do not have power, support from other races (white racists have support from east asians, indians, middle-easterners, and many hispanics) and we are at the bottom of the "Racial totem pole". People that are above can use race to persecute those below; you can't persecute upwards (unless you have a huge advantage in numbers like in South Africa, and even then, a good deal of it is a thirst for revenge).    Some more interesting double standards:    Why is it OK for white guys to sleep with many asian women, but bad when Black guys want to get some (and we often fail at that since asians depsise Blacks and worship whites)?    Why is it OK for whites to conquer other lands and subjugate people, but wrong when Blacks want to have their own?    Why is it wrong for Blacks to tell a few racist jokes or make a few remarks (that won't be acknowledged by anyone really) when whites have spread hatred and tales of Black inferiority all over the world (and people actually believed them)?|`|4Za1utmCaa	Simply put, black racists are cut more slack because they do not have anywhere near the same power to oppress and discriminate at the same level white racists do.    If blacks made up the majority in America, and held most the power positions in the public and private sectors, it would be a different story.|`|UspK4SQBaa	It's a lame remake of a classic movie.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof. Will you do that for me?|`|0s190C7Zaa	Hey you're people too and should have free rights to expression but of course not in front of children. Good Luck.|`|qEdhPD8Laa	Real vampires will not be accepted by the majority of people, nor should we expect to be. Gays aren't accepted by the majority of people, and they've been part of human society from before recorded history. Witches aren't accepted, and they've been around since before recorded history too.     When a small group of people seems different from the majority, they will normally be ostracized. When that group seems threatening to the majority, they're even more unlikely to be accepted.     The occult communitity believes in psychic vampires and generally sees them as a threat. We feed on human energy, so of course we seem threatening. Saying, "Don't worry. I'll only take a little," or "I only take from consenting donors" doesn't make people feel safe. The idea creeps them out. It's like having someone tell you they're a pick-pocket or cleptomaniac. You'll never feel completely safe around them afterwards.    BTW, the TOV and other vampire cults are not mainstream even within the vampire community, so please don't use them to explain what real vampires are like.    A friend of mine and I were discussing on an elist how stupid some people's views are about psychic vampires. She came to the conclusion that the best way to get people to accept you as being sane and non-threatening is to let them get to know you really well just *as a person*. Eventually you can tell them you're a vampire, but not until they know and like you for yourself. It's like when people are predjudiced against gay people, then they find out someone they like or really care about is gay. They usually realize their friend or loved one is the same person they always were, and being gay doesn't change that.     It's the same with being a vampire. Be yourself, but don't think you have to tell everyone everything about yourself. If you're into BDSM, you don't tell everyone. If you're a witch, you don't tell everyone. If you're a vampire, you don't tell everyone either. You find a few friends you can share this side of yourself with, and you share other sides of yourself with other people.    Everyone wants to be accepted for who they really are, but the reality of life is that not everyone is capable of that kind of acceptance.    - P.|`|h1eBWehMaa	i think you need to grow up|`|AA12384132	No vampiring will never be accepted.......................|`|yCTxg4t5aa	As long as things like the afterlife, and subtle energy can't be proven then i doubt that the world will ever accept the notion of real vampires. I personally don't thing the world is ready for it, i think most of us are better off staying in the coffin, so to speak.|`|aygUtJ1Raa	I prefer to hide it under the Black Veil. It was created for that purpose, knowing that no, vampirism will always be seen as a hoax, and hollywood will always conquer. Hiding is easier, and it makes it more of a dayside/nightside thing.   Why tell anyone? Being different doesn't get better once people know, and not everyone is meant to be a black swan. Running around saying "OH! I'm a vampire!" makes people think of you as a roleplayer/poser/freak. Hide it and you'll never have that issue. Ignore everything else related to vampires if you want to.    EDIT: And no, I'd rather lie than be called a poser freak who plays the part of a sad little lost vampire. Then I'd turn into a twilight twit, anne rice obsessed weirdo, or dracula nerd.   Splendid. Seems more mysterious hidden anyway :)|`|AA11835015	we had a lot of vampires in politics. bloodsuckers. democrats called them republicans, republicans called then democrats. bush looked good in fangs|`|YeFt3IEUaa	Wake up, grow up, get a life. Vampires are meant for fiction. Humans only ingested blood when we used to eat meat raw (before fire). What you're suggesting is for the human race to go back,what, 250,000 years???? You seriously want to drink other people's blood? If humans would have stayed that undeveloped, you would not being living the type of life you are now. You seriously need therapy and need to realize people like that will not be accepted because IT IS WRONG!!!    STOP ACTING LIKE YOU ARE A VICTIM!|`|ff545BLyaa	No you will never be accepted.  Plain and simple, are the jews more accepted today then in the 40's?  No!  Why should vampires be any different, (not that I believe in them).  But people who think that they are vampires being accepted is a joke, no one will ever accept any of you freaks despite the delirious twilight idiots!  You shall be persecuted until the end of time and I will be there casting the first stone every step of the way because that's all vamps are is wackos!|`|sjMIFH9Faa	Whatever happened to fringe cults basing themselves off something more than popular culture? I mean really, take the Cult of Isis or Mithra, based on Egyptian and Mesopotamian views of rebirth. The pre-Christian gnostics who based their cults off secret knowledge or the philosophical cults that quasi worshiped human reason and potential.......Whatever happened to them?     Now all you have to do is see the movie Twilight (I doubt many of you have read the books), dress in black, and wear too much eye makeup and suddenly you are a vampire.    And whatever happened to the vampires that impale invading Turks in Romania? You know, the ones who are more interested in ripping people apart than being understood.     Truly, buy a goat and put it on an alter, slit its throat, and say a few prayers to Apollo. After this, burn the fat and bones as an offering to the gods then have yourself a feast while drinking wine till you can no longer stand. Now that's a cult that everyone can appreciate.|`|GuBF5xhDaa	I think it will be a really long time, if ever, that real vampirism is accepted. Just look at what a hard time the homosexual community is having. Homosexuality is even something that is somewhat understandable, not like vampirism that is odd on its own, let alone being automatically associated with Dracula and Hollywood. More and more people are learning the reality of vampirism, and are accepting vampires for who they are, but even that still puts it in the minority. I greatly admire people like Don Henrie and Michelle Belanger for being the first legitimate vampires to go out and start explaining the truth to the general public.|`|anfhcnWeaa	i believe that one day we will be accepted but that day is far away in the distant future,people in this time period are too close-minded to believe in us or to truly accept us for what we and who we are. personally i have told several of my friends only two of whom believed me and were okay with the others thought it was a joke or called me crack-pot.or told to grew up.but in the future when the world is more open-minded maybe we will truly be accepted.|`|919XflnDaa	It would not be a good idea to share our culture and tradition with normal humans. I am not one to stay in the shadows. I believe they must accept if I am in the open. There is no way to deny what is real. They will never understand our kind. They are too involved with the superhuman lovers from Twilight and ravaging monsters of all the other movies. But if they really want us to be like that, I say why the hell not. I wouldn't mind tearing open a few idiots for the sake of our kind. Message me if it suits you. Our kind should stick together though. So try not to be too shy about it. I'll be waiting.|`|GkhNUHofaa	uhmm..so you think you are a vampire??? ok...|`|Rk5D1m8oaa	Sorry, semi-cults like the ToV and friends cheaply rip off of LaVey who ripped off of Ayn Rand, and uses some basic chaos magic in it. It also creates a brand new pantheon putting it in line with wicca/other neopagans.    No, the Occult community does not take vampires seriously.|`|GTb4UyCkaa	With the changing tides in culture it is possible that someday people like you and me will be really accepted. Books sometimes put us in a bad light. And well with movies like Vampire Clan can you blame people for not liking us? I think (hope) that someday we aren't the "crazies".|`|QoIavpQQaa	well technically it is accepted you see there is a condition called vampire ism which you need to drank blood to stay healthy and well you cant fly turn into bats huge monsters or have fangs ( unless you get someone to actually give you fangs lol ) some people with this condition are murderess and drank human blood but some people just i don't know find a butcher and buy pigs blood (the people who are murderers kill them with guns and knives they don't just sink there teeth in )|`|j2IL3DiBaa	vampirism is becoming more and more known as time passes, so i know that one day the majority will accept as they have come to accept other new things. but there will always be a small amount that wont accept. i havent even told any of my friends becuase i already know that they will say i read to much or im getting to in to my imagination. just wait though one day we will be able walk the streets with people knowing what we are and accepting it.|`|5AFXuKSRaa	Anything not in the mainstream "majority" will always be seen as "freakish", simply because it isn't the "norm". As for books and movies, they contain so many stereotypical fantasies that they could hardly be a step towards "acceptance". If you feel the need to share with friends, go ahead, but you can't control their response. I take subject of vampirism as a personal condition and I don't feel the need for others to tell me or for me to ask about it. If I were a genius, IQ-wise, I wouldn't feel any need to tell everyone, nor would I appreciate everyone asking me to explain it. It is just the way you are, and you are, above all, a human.......vampiric or not.|`|BpNrx9Viaa	Once you stop calling yourself "Vampires" and pick a name that isn't a fictional creature|`|0IKdojzeaa	I have no proof of YOU being a vampire, but...to answer: No. It will be just as accepted as my kind: humiliation, ridicule, murder, hate, hunters, etc.     Do you really think humans are ready to accept such possibilities? Now what I find funny is that they deny we exist. Oh, yes, they are truly very smart beings...masters of the universe. They have no clue what's beyond their own planet, not to mention they destroy their own planet. Ooh, and here's the good part, they kill each other!    Yes, obviously very intelligent beings. And, they have the funniest way of dealing with creatures like us...they kill us too! They hang us, burn us, cage us, drown us, etc.     Ooh, and while we're on the subject, let's evaluate one of their famous tortures from the witch trials to see just how smart they really are, shall we? Okay, this is how it goes, you tie someone to a boulder and you throw them in a lake (or other body of water) with their hands tied behind their back. If they float to the top, they're a witch. If they don't, then they're innocent. So, if you're not guilty, you're left drowning at the bottom of a lake while the humans above you look at each other: "Well crap, Bill. Looks like he's innocent."    See the genius here?|`|Bka6mtoDaa	Vampirism is not meant to be accepted by the mainstream and being able to hide if you are a real vampyre is a benefit.    So lets say that in this world where people have so much indifferences to a persons race or religion.    Vampyres would be accepted what would happen ?  Just maybe it would make you feel better about yourself cuase you wouldnt have to hide your nature in the shadows.    You could go out and let out your nonturnal nature without being looked at wrongly by mundane individuals.    Thou vampirism was not born in the light the nature of the vampyre no matter how you look at it is in the darkness.    Rather you choose the light or the darkness is up to you   Yet its a simple fact that cant be neglected the vampyre is a creature of the night and a nonturnal hunter.    Yes certain individuals may put themselves to the forefront of the media getting lots of attention but ask yourself what are they accomplishing ?     Example the kid that is in high school whos still living with his parents which are against everything do with nonturnal creatures or anything paranormal.    This same kid is looking for a role model and someone to learn from is it good for him or her to go around saying there a vampyre if they really are ?    Also would they be accepted by the parents or told to get out the house ?    Now back to the question are people going to look at the true vampyre or the vampyres cousins the otherkin any different.    Just talk to a person whos otherkin and they tell a mundane person about it.   They are a hybrid vampyre/angel/fae the common masses would label you as a freak let alone accept you.    Why becuase people are more concerned about whats going on in there own lives or watching there favorite tv show.    My whole thing on this matter is given the way this world is why would a true vampyre not a poser or blood fetish individual want to ever be known as that by the pubic.    I'am not saying that some wont accept the vampyre but the masses will never accept them in less theres a huge change in the way people think about alot of matters not just the vampyre.
RgAVm7zCaa	Wow, you need to pay attention more in English class. That's happened to me before, my teacher called me a smart a**. I was in high school then, and I basically just blew it off because he was a jerk anyways. Everyone hated him. But really, you should go to your school counselor or something or the principal, and tell them about it. Because teachers should insult students, no matter what.

They suck and they are there just for attention. Don't let it get to you or you'll wind up like me. I got so hurt and discouraged, I stopped doing my homework. My grades went to F's and D's.

AA11010665	Nice to see the youth of today seeing shades of grey not just black & white.    I presume you are male? You don't expect to get vaccines just for females do you? The reason they ask those background questions is for a number of reasons, for example some ethnic groups and subgroups are more susceptible to certain diseases, others have immunity, either naturally or through parental immunity, for example i will have a higher immunity to small pox as my parents were both vaccinated before i was born than someone who's parents weren't. Chances of me coming into contact are virtually nil, so 1. why pay for the vaccination & 2. why put my body through this for no real reason. There is also the concept of "herd immunity", you only need to vaccinate a certain percentage and things can't spread, why put yourself through the injection if you don't have to.    At my doctors there is a poster for men with waist sizes and ethnic groups, as a white male you can have a larger waist size than other ethnic groups without increasing your risk to heart disease, count yourself lucky!    This is actually an answer to your actual question, if you think this is 'idiotic' or 'indie', i would say you are more likely looking for someone to 'bash'!

ZmdIlkpQaa	I fought alongside Arab Muslim troops in my war, and I worked alongside Muslims from a variety of countries afterwords.  My good friends and neighbors are Persian Muslims.  I don't fear or dislike them as a group any more than I do Christians or Jews, and I've found them to be very thjoughtful, kind and hospitable people, individually, and often more philosophical and intellectual than many Christians, rather similar to the Jews I've met.      I think for the past eight years, racism against Arabs in general and Muslims in general has soared, in no small part because of the Bush Administration's fear mongering.  Shortly after 9/11, in fact, a Sikh who I knew casually, was murdered in Phoenix because the crazy Christian redneck who killed him mistook him for a Muslim.  How's that for racism?|`|bYDVTv7Maa	A group of extremists is no reason to hate/fear everybody who just happens to share their religion.

ACA8i43Gaa	I like reading the embarrassing moments too. Maybe I'm the guy who take delight in other people's embarrassing moments.    olol    I recommand a website for you, I read the embarrassing moments everyday in the website.    http://www.YourEmbarrassingMoments.com    The below one is the most embarrassing moments I think:    My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.

The very first time we took our then older nephew out after the baby was born, we were having lunch at the food court at the mall and our priest was passing by and came just to talk to our usually "well-mannered" child.   He made the mistake of asking him about his new baby brother and without hesitation, he said in a very low angered voice:    "that S-O-B........"

0d4885127f2e8efc746aee0382752eb5aa	Spanish speakers are very emphatic, in other words they use their hands and facial features to emphasize what they want to say.  So during the movie, pay ALOT of attention to the setting, and what the actor's body language is portraying. It might also help to pause the movie, write down some of the words u don't understand as u hear them, look them up in a spanish/english dictionary or an online translator and then replay the part in the movie where u heard it first with the new definition already in your head.  This will help u learn phrases and new words really quickly.  Understand though, in alot of movies, even english language movies, people use slang or colloquialisms so these words or phrases might be hard to accurately translate, sometimes spanish and english don't translate word for exact word! good luck!

f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"Why should women go into politics?"    For the same reason most men get into it: The power and the ability to make whatever changes they see fit.    "Are there any specific characteristics they can offer that men can't? "    No.  Contrary to popular belief, women aren't going to necessarily add a "softer" and "gentler" side to politics.  Evil exists in both genders.    "Specifically, women can understand problems more, are more compassionate and understanding,"    Again, not necessarily.  It's a nice stereotype, but a stereotype, nevertheless.    "Why should we have more women in politics?"    When people say that we should have more minorities (women, people of color, etc.) in politics, it's not necessarily because they'll add something new, it's because they feel that the government should be as diverse as the people who helped create it.

I mean,I care about pollution and haven't thrown anything on the sidewalk or the ground EVER...so that separates us from 3rd world countries, and then another experience I had. I was travelling on the Greyhound (this is before the dreaded and shocking stabbing incident happened) and my family was with me. At that time, my sister was about 3, reason enough for her wanting to sit beside a member of her family, and in all the busses from Montreal and Ottawa through Toronto, everyone was nice enough to give my sister and my mom a seat together, but in NY, people refused to budge. I mean it was horrible, my mom had to 7 seats away while my sister was feeling sick to her stomach. And I also feel I can trust people in Canada, I told my friend in Boston once that...yeah I just leave my laptop on the study table at uni when I need to go to the bathroom or something...and she's like "AND IT'S STILL THERE WHEN YOU GET BACK???" because in America this would be a no-no. Someone from America even told me once that we're too nice, so nice that he was a bit freaked out. And I get it, because we tend to care for one another, and we make it a point to help out others. Even the most dangerous-looking people (with tatoos and piercings and hair died red) are so caring that they'll hold a door open for you...that's nice! When a stranger offers you a ride in case of a bus strike...that's nice! I mean, we might not be the best dressed or the most popular, or the most likely to have the brightest future out of all, but we're definitely there in terms of unity.

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	Here are a few verses from the Bible on Talents and Abilities.    Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive and inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.   Colossians 3:23-24    Since we are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.   1 Corinthians 14:12    We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a mans gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith. If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.   Romans 12:6-8    Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.   James 1:17    Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.   Romans 12:11    Edit: You must be referring to the Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-28) in which 3 servants were given 5 talents, 2 talents and 1 talent respectively. In those days talents were equivalent to money. However, we can learn from this story that God has given us each different talents and abilities that he expects us to put to good use. We shouldnt hide these talents and bury them in the sand as the third servant did but instead we should use our talents and abilities for the glory of God.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Talents in the bible refers to money. They are just after your cash.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	1 Corinthians 12   7Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. 8To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, 9to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 10to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues,[a] and to still another the interpretation of tongues.[b] 11All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.     12The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. 13For we were all baptized by[c] one Spirit into one bodywhether Jews or Greeks, slave or freeand we were all given the one Spirit to drink.     14Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. 15If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. 16And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. 17If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 19If they were all one part, where would the body be? 20As it is, there are many parts, but one body.     21The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" 22On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 24while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 25so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 26If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.     27Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. 28And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. 29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues[d]? Do all interpret? 31But eagerly desire[e] the greater gifts.        And now I will show you the most excellent way.|`|BUEp2B9gaa	So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.    1 Corinthians 10:31|`|AA11188574	(Matthew 25:14-30) 14?For it is just as when a man, about to travel abroad, summoned slaves of his and committed to them his belongings. 15?And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to still another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went abroad. 16?Immediately the one that received the five talents went his way and did business with them and gained five more. 17?In the same way the one that received the two gained two more. 18?But the one that received just one went off, and dug in the ground and hid the silver money of his master. 19?After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. 20?So the one that had received five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, Master, you committed five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more. 21?His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master. 22?Next the one that had received the two talents came forward and said, Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I gained two talents more. 23?His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master. 24?Finally the one that had received the one talent came forward and said, Master, I knew you to be an exacting man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow. 25?So I grew afraid and went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. 26?In reply his master said to him, Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow? 27?Well, then, you ought to have deposited my silver monies with the bankers, and on my arrival I would be receiving what is mine with interest. 28?Therefore TAKE away the talent from him and give it to him that has the ten talents. 29?For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance; but as for him that does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 30?And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where [his] weeping and the gnashing of [his] teeth will be.    This is the parable of the talents. That was a denomination of money. It represented the spiritual things Jesus [master] gave us and what we do with it. The more we do the more glory we give to God.|`|ijyish4Baa	1 corinthians 10:31 says whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God
