20081101224627AALz0t5	Pets;Dogs	My dog is limping, shaking, and acts tired.She is in pain, yelps when pressure is put on her leg.What do I do?	She seems really tired, but she makes efforts to climb and lick people, but when she puts pressure on her leg, she starts yelping. She shakes , so i think that she is in pain. She is also throwing up some things she eats. I am going to take her to the vet i a little bit, but what should I do in the meantime?
20081116005541AA3FfKG	Pets;Cats	My cat is drooling? some foam came out...?	hi i have a 3 year old cat and I noticed that like 3 or 4 days ago he started to kind of choke with his saliva so I just thought maybe he ate grass or something, but now since this morning he threw up and a little bit of foam came out, now at 3:50am he started to choke again so I got up and he only threw foam and some saliva, what can this be? maybe I should take him to the vet or maybe it will just go away? please help, by the way he seems fine like he plays with my other cats and goes only to the front yard, maybe he ate a lizard? help please thank you ; )

20081117234829AAFl8uZ	Pets;Dogs	What should i do if im being sued for a dog bite?	my dog jumps my fence and usually he is very kind and mellow dog for a pit bull and now im might be  in the works of beign sued by the parents who claim my dog bit their little girl around 8 or 9 years of age its hard for me to believe because my pit is very mellow and usually never barks at any one she might have alerted him by panicking not sure. the bite looks like a small minor scratch may or may not need stitches if they decide not to sue and just make me pay the hospital expenses how much would it be if they take her to the ER(which i think its completely unneccessary) for a mere small dog bite ?  again she may or may not need stitches,also my dog has its rabies shot.

20070805204740AAXe4zl	Pets;Dogs	Best breed with small children in family?	Would really like to add a pet to our family, but we have two small children: 6 mos & 4 yrs.  It would seem that a small breed would be best, but I've read that they are actually worse with little one than some larger breeds.  There are just so many; I've spent a great deal of time researching this & still haven't nailed down a good answer.     As for adopting a dog from a shelter - that won't work in my area.  We have tried this - our shelters do NOT discriminate and will adopt out any dog, even when obviously not suitable for a particular family or when it has special needs (not informing adopter of said needs).  It is too painful to surrender when you just cannot make it work, and I've been through it once and DO not want to go through it again. I'm absolutely fine w/adopting from a rescue, & plan to do so - just want some advice from actual pet owners on best breed.      We live in a single family home, large privacy-fenced yard.  I'm a stay at home mom, no other pets

20070722113404AAgg8xh	Pets;Cats	My cat tracks the kitty littler out of the box, and all over the floor?	I keep my cats litter box in the bathroom. The bathroom attaches to my bedroom. I have a closed in litter box becuase when he would scratch the litter, it would fly all over the place.      I still have a problem though. When he jumps out of the litter box, he brings the litter with him! Theres so much litter all over my bathroom floor (I vacuum every time i see it of course). I have tile floors in my bathroom and a small bathroom rug down. I dont mind the litter on the bathroom floor as much as I mind it elsewhere in the house. If I'm not home to vacuum right away, he must walk through the kitty litter..and it sticks to his paws i'm guessing - becuase i find it on my bedroom floor sometimes (i guess its not that big of deal.)...       Before I got my cat I vacuumed about once every other day. Now I find myself vacuuming multiple times a day.       Any suggestions on how to catch the kitty litter and keep it off the floors?

20070629195059AAzDXug	Pets;Dogs	Great Dane Diet?	I will be picking up my Dane puppy in about 2 weeks. I researched what to feed him and had decided on Canidae. When I went to the specialty pet feed market near my house that carries it they suggested I get Eagle Pack instead. They said it would be better for the dogs bones and stuff. From what I've read about it it seems just as good, if not better, than the Canidae. I just wanted to get some opinions on the brand. Thx guys.

20070622133015AAAvOeH	Pets;Dogs	Question about spay?	I rescued a 3 pound chih. Well it was luck how i came acrossed her. Anyways she just has major surgery as she was bred to a to big of a male and her uterous ruptured inside of her. The pups didnt make it and the vet repaired the uterous but almost lost this chihuahua. they said she was useless now they cant breed her. Anyways they told me she couldnt be spayed. The vets wont spay her cause there was to much damage. Can this happen or can she be spayed at a later date anyways.

20070710075244AAf4vn1	Pets;Dogs	Question about crate/potty training?	I've got a 1 1/2 year old dog who has been taught to use the bathroom on the paper inside. We want to change that now, and we bought him a crate to help with it. Well, he started to poop inside and I caught him and said, "Noooo!" "That's bad!" Just kinda said it real loud to hope he sorta gets the hint that he isn't supposed to do that. So, in the middle of him going, I quickly grabbed his collar, and brought him right outside. Well, he was just as happy as can be to go outside, and when we got out there he only peed. I praised him for that, but my question is this: If the dog goes inside, and you immediately take him out to "show him he's supposed to go outside and do that" then will the dog not see it as a reward? B/c he was just so happy and excited to go outside. So wouldn't he see it as, "I go on the floor, and I get to go outside. Yay!". Wouldn't they see it as a reward, even if you did fuss him while he was doing it inside? B/c he seemed to have forgotten about the fuss I made.

20070704224336AAldh65	Pets;Dogs	Holistic Dog Food?	I have a 50 pound English Pointer, he is 2 years and 3 months old on the 9th. He is very active and has a high metabolism. He is considered a large dog and I've heard from 3 vets that Eagle Pack is going to be the best dog food I can get. What do people think? I want the best for him. If this is one of the best foods and I end up ordering some, which type should I buy? Ranger (my dog) is active, but not a working dog, he is also a large dog but he also has a small rash/allergy on his tummy. I can't afford to buy all 3 and mix, I can only afford to buy one type seeing as I turn 16 on the 9th and I haven't been able to show up at work due to traveling. Within the next month I should have more money, but I still can't afford to buy all three, maybe two. So, as of now I need to know:      The recommend holistic dog food (experience)      Which type to buy      Where to buy it      Approx. how much it cost for a bag about15 pounds (give or take)      And I am open to anything else that will help THANK YOU
20070710064824AACTKxz	Pets;Dogs	When will the bleeding stop?	We got an 8 month old pup from the shelter.  They said they would call with her appointment for her spay. She's 10 months now  Well, now that she is in heat for who knows how long, we don't know when we'll be able to get her spayed.  I know that this heat cycle can last up to 3 weeks but when does the bleeding stop?  We don't know exactly when she started bleeding.  she started licking herself there about 2 weeks ago.  We noticed blood on the floor about 1 week ago.  She still drips when she is up on her hind legs.  and boy does she stink! I can't wait to give her a bath!!  Anyway, she is still all swollen.  Does the swelling go down before or after the bleeding?  Is there anyway to tell if she is almost over this?  (without getting too close...lol)  When should I be able to say she started?  When she started the licking or when I noticed the blood for the first time?  I have never had a female dog that wasn't already spayed so this is all new to me!  HELP

20070728205218AAFp6Rg	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog scratch?	My little almost 1year old chihuahua has very recently taken up the habit of scratching the ground with both of her little feet.   She looks like a little bull getting ready to charge.  She does this EVERYWHERE.  Not just after pottying.  When she is on my bed.... she will do it. On the carpet.... basically anywhere she is standing.  I did not think dogs had scent glands in their feet... so I question if that is why.  There is also not a particular time she does it either.  She could just be standing there and just starts to scratch.

Or do you shave the belly part and just let the side hair hang over (so you can't really tell that the belly is shaved unless the dog is on it's back)?      I'm considering getting a male Samoyed, I'm just not sure how the hair/pee thing is going to work out with a male dog.

20070620123625AACZo7V	Pets;Dogs	My dogs don't like each other!?!?	I have two dogs, a fawn colored pug and a yellow/white lab.   The pug is a year old, we've had her since she was a baby. And the lab is about 5-6 months, we just adopted her from the humane society on Monday.         We were hoping they would get along, but apparently not. Percy (the pug) has always been quite a yapper and this is still the case. She'll just sit their and yap yap yap at Sophie (the lab). Sophie won't bark much at her but she does try to bite her alot. Yesterday I just set Percy down and Sophie come up and bites her on the face! I'm sure she just wants to play but to Percy it could be potentially harmful. While Sophie will be mainly outside, and Percy inside, I still want them to be able to get along when they do interact. Thanks so much!

20070410123127AAjxC87	Pets;Reptiles	My snake has not passed the mouse I fed her a few weeks ago; its a lump in her belly. What should I do? Vet?	My snake is a corn snake who I have had since she was a couple weeks old. She is now a little over a year. I am worried about the lump in her belly. She recently had an episode about a week ago where she threw up clear bubbly liquid. I thought she was dying but she seemed to be happy after that was out. The lump in her belly is about the same size as the mouse I fed her so Im pretty sure its the mouse. She usually is a quick digester.  Im afraid to feed her agian because it might get stuck with the other one. She is not actiing any different. I want to know if there is anything i can do to help her pass the mouse or should I just take her to the vet?

I'm really worried and nothing in her tank has been out of the ordinary. So I'm wondering if anyone knows what could be wrong and should I take her to the vet?

20070615201147AAiFdJ1	Pets;Dogs	My dog is having pain in his lower back area. What could be the cause?	I have an 8 year old German Shepard/ Lab mix. He is usually an active dog, though getting a little calmer as he has gotten older. Today he seemed to be in a lazy mood, but I didn't think much of it until I let him outside. While he was outside I noticed he kept laying down and he was not barking at anything (which is abnormal for him). So I went out to play with him and found that he was slow in getting up and not playful. I brought him in and had him drink some water after giving him a few treats. So he is eating and drinking just fine. As i was petting him he started to whine when I got near his lower back.Could he have possibly slept wrong and it will pass or should I get him to the vet immediately. I was adbised by friends to give him and asprin, but was not sure if this was safe. Please all advice is appreciated.

( i am not sure though) I have a giant schnauzer and i am dying to know what category my schnazuer falls into. I thought Giant Schnazuers were a large breed, not a giant breed. I thought Giant breeds were defined by 100 pounds or over. My puppy is only 20 pounds now but his father was 90 and his mom 65 so im unsure about him. Is there another way to determin a Giant breed from a Large breed. This question has been bothering my for a while now, so please help!

20070708111242AAcw7UP	Pets;Dogs	How many agree with this?	Most training programs are based on reward and punishment and rely on conditioning. There is an alternative. You can teach your dog from a model based on learning. The difference between conditioning and learning is that true learning is generative. Teaching from a generative model teaches your dog how to learn. When you teach your dog how to learn, you escape from having to train it situationally.

20070712184840AAgG0TX	Pets;Dogs	Beagle Behavior?	I have a 8 month old male (neutered) beagle... and a 16 month old boxer. After much training, our beagle seems to be housebroken but, lately he has been peeing in the house.  It seems mostly when he is upset... For example, the dogs both got new chew toys and the beagle wants what the boxer has and peed to show that he was upset he wasn't getting his way. The dog will also pee on his bed at night, almost in a marking behavior.    What is the best way to deal with this behavior, or how could you change it. He is a really sweet and loving dog, but I can't stand his attitude sometimes!

Last night I took my dog out to go to the bathroom and let her run around and then out of nowhere a big rat or some sort of animal was walking in the street and my dog went over there and ir bite her on her lip and it was bleeding for almost 1 hour, and it also did something to her front paw to make it bleed. I finnaly got in under control and her to lay down. What I was wondering was if that animal has rabies and if so when will I be able to tell if my dog got it from the bite. Im so worried about her I havent been to bed. This has never happened before. Im scared she is going to die before I realize she has rabies and I dont have the money to toake her to the vet till the first friend in august. So how do I tell if my dog has rabies?

A short while after letting him in, he will head straight for the dining room table and urinate on the same chair/table leg each time. He does not empty a full bladder or anything like that. It is just a small bit. Could he have troubles emptying his bladder?  How do I break him of this? Also is there something that I can use to treat that spot to ensure that he will stop doing it?

20070731104353AAEEDfM	Pets;Dogs	Why is my Beagle afraid of going outside?	Ever since the 4th of July, my 2 year old mini beagle is afraid of going outside. She gets out there, sniffs around, then wants to go right back inside. She struggles with the leash to try to get back inside and eventually she will go potty, but it takes sometimes up to a half hour before she will go. She never "barks" to go outside (never did) so we keep her on a schedule to take her out to the bathroom, but since she is afraid of being outdoors, she only goes to the bathroom like once a day now. She still likes going on walks, but i dont have the time to go on walks during my lunch break so she can go to the bathroom. Any advice?

20070731194716AAovFER	Pets;Dogs	Would a second dog be a good idea?	I have a 12 year old American Bulldog (female), and used to have an adult mutt (female) that we needed to keep separated. It's been a few years since we put down my dog, and I want to get a new puppy, but my mom doesn't think it will be a good idea. She's afraid that my Bulldog will attack a new puppy. It did attack my other dog once but she thought that it was a danger to me. I think now that she is older and much more calm, she would be able to tolerate a new puppy in the house. I would plan on keeping the dogs separated most of the time but would this be a bad idea given my dog's history with other dogs?

I have a Sheltie who showed up at my house a few months after Katrina, and she is terrified of storms (not due to the hurricane though, her former owners whom I found through her id chip said she's always been afraid of them).   Any way, I can't seem to get her to relax even a small bit during a storm.  I use the general advice given by Ceasar Milan and do not comfort her when she is anxious, but can never get her to relax enough to praise her for this.  She does not misbehave, but she just tries to melt into my legs and is extremely fearful.  I don't won't to give her a tranq and hoped that just my being relaxed would help her.(I love storms, by the way).  Does anyone have a suggestion for me for this?   She is 7 years old and has had this problem for a long time.

20090225141307AAQshAc	Pets;Dogs	What are some things to motivate my dog?	Ok, so I'm teaching my 10 month old Dachshund how to run an agility trail because she loves to preform tricks and is incredibly mentally and physically skilled. Indoors, she will preform any trick I teach her because she is so motivated by food. We haven't put her in a class yet because we're waiting until spring, but I'm trying to teach her some tricky things so she'll get the groove of things. I have already taught her how to do the table, target and jump in side because I can use objects inside to create them. I can't fit weave polls inside, so I set up a series of sticks outside, regulation length apart, to mimic a real weave. But outside she doesn't want to go after the food, she's more preoccupied with the smells of rabbits and birds and the people and cars that go by that she can bark at. I've figured out she likes to chew on sticks outside, so I've started to use that as a motivation. Now, she does really well when I can get her attention, her ability isn't the problem. The real problem is, she doesn't always want to play with the stick. Some times she'd rather sniff the ground or chase a bird, and if some one parks to empty their recycling (there's a recycling dumpster a little ways down my street), FORGET IT! I might as well not be there. I'm not saying she goes and runs after them, she just barks. Is there some kind of reward that I'm looking past? I mean some thing she CAN'T ignore.

20070823223904AAItWlb	Pets;Dogs	Nervous dog?	My border collie is extremely nervous... She'd hide from her own shadow if she could outrun it. She's a big old softy & rescued as a pup. I assume she was severely mistreated and when I got her she was thin & covered in ticks. It took me days to rid her of parasites. Any loud noise, she's on my lap shivering like a leaf. Anyway, she is social, but doesn't do well with children or babies. She doesn't nip or bite... she hides from them for hrs at a time. She'll come out after a while, but as soon as a child or baby makes a noise or start crying, back into hiding she'll go.      I'm having a baby in three weeks, & while I'm sure I'll be able to introduce the chow (who loves children) I think it will take a bit longer with my b/c. Any suggestions on how to make her transition smoother? Obviously a crying baby is going to be a shock to her system.

I am trying to breed my 5 year old 12 pound poodle/mix to a 9 pound very beautiful and friendly mixed 2 year old that is supposedly in the correct timing right now but my boy couldnt perform!. He mounts her but nothing happens! He successfully bred about 3 years ago.    They are coming back tomorrow for another try.    What is wrong with him and what is the solution?    The woman was so impressed with my dog's fantastically friendly temperament and looks that she asked me 2 months ago for this service for which I will get a puppy. She made out a stud contract too.       To all the anti-breeders police. I also believe that BIG dogs should not be bred because there are truly too many in the shelteers BUT that is NOT true with small dogs!My Humane Society very rarely gets any small dogs! So the only place to get SMALL dogs in this town is from Scamps which buys from backyard breeders and puppy mills.    SHAME ON YOU PEOPLE!!      I ALSO STRONGLY disapprove of purebred breeding and purebred dog shows. PPurebreeders have really screwed up lots of dogs with inbred genetic diseases and weaknessses. So do NOT give me that "But They arent pure breds" crap! These are 2 very nice, beautiful  healthy small dogs with great temperaments. GREAT family dogs! NOT SHOW DOGS!!!

20090225141059AAzhtaH	Pets;Dogs	My puppy has separation anxiety?	My 3.5 month old puppy seems to have separation anxiety these few days. He has been off-crate for over a week and has been so good on training pads (he hasn't had all his shots yet, so we haven't started walking him yet). We let him roam free in our room with nothing hazardous that's reachable to him when we're not home. But these past few days he's been peeing/pooping in places he knows he isn't allowed to. He knows, because when we're home, he goes to the peepads 95% of the time. Also, he'd always tend to drag the peepads to random places like he's been playing with it. And again, he never does this when we're home with him. We don't leave him home alone for more than 2.5 to 3 hours at a time, so we just don't quite understand why this is all just started. We spend all our time with him when we're home, but what else can we do to help him get over this separation anxiety, if that is the problem?? Thanks in advance.

20070819095647AAD17Bc	Pets;Dogs	My Puppy Has Stuck Poo. Help Please?	I've only had my little puppy Oscar (6 and a bit weeks old) for 2 days and he seems to have trouble with pooing. Today he tried to poo and it appeared to be causing him pain and it hasn''t properly come out. He seems fine now but the poo has come out about 1cm and is hardened. He is playing around but if i try to break off the poo he squiggles around. He was wormed only a week ago. Should i break it off? Its been like that for 9 hours. I can't get to a vet until tuesday. I gave him porridge which i was told would help because of the fibre. I read that it could be due to the stress of leaving his mum for the first time. He has had fresh water available all the time. But i don't know whether i should remove the hard bit of poo. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks xxx

20070823223916AA5hEv3	Pets;Dogs	Yorkie problem!?	My dog is almost 3 years old. He still pees and pops in the house, but not all the time. Most of the time when we are around he is fine; he holds it until we can let him out. When we are busy and not paying attention to him and/or keep him in the kitchen (instead of the crate) he goes. At this point it’s not a housebreaking issue, right? Is he just ticked off because we are ignoring him? I really need to resolve this issue, How?
