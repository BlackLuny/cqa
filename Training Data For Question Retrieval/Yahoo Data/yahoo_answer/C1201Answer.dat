KJHw0oI3aa	I "googled it" and got the following information:    "Safety matches  These matches can only be lit by striking on the specially prepared abrasive surface on the side of the matchbox, while "strike-anywhere" matches (illegal in many countries because of fire hazard) can be struck on any rough surface.   The heads of safety matches contain sulfur and oxidizing agents such as potassium chlorate with powdered glass, fillers, colouring matter and a binder of glue and starch. The striking surface on the box contains red phosphorus, powdered glass or silica (sand), filler and binder. When the match is struck, the heat from the friction causes a small amount of red phosphorus on the box to be vapourized as white phosphorus vapour. The latter burns spontaneously in air and initiates the decomposition of the potassium chlorate which liberates oxygen. The sulfur ignites and lights the wood of the match.     The heads of strike-anywhere matches contain phosphorus sulphide P4S3, oxidizing agents, powdered glass to increase the friction and a glue as a binder. Since both phosphorus and sulfur are present on the heads of the strike-anywhere matches, striking these matches anywhere will generate enough heat of friction to ignite the phosphorus sulfide. The train of reactions thereafter is similar to that which is described above."|`|IlndnVyBaa	The red part you strike is potassium chlorate (KClO3)
JtvBPQTZaa	When tissue cells are harmed they release different chemicals that trigger the inflammatory response, e.g. histamine. These chemicals function together and result in vasodilation (widening of blood capillaries) and they also raise the permeability of the capillaries (which means they can absorb things quicker.) This then leads to a rise in flow of blood to these harmed tissue cells, meaning white blood cells are able to get to the harmed tissue quicker than in normal circumstances, therefore enhancing the inflammatory process/response. :)|`|4A6kUcB3aa	Increases blood flow to an injured or infected area, allowing inflammatory white blood cells better access.

However, from the Big Bang until the Sun and the Earth came into existence was over eight billion years.  Thus there was no sunrise and sunset to mark time.  There is even a question as to what happened first: Did the Sun ignite to be seen in the sky before or after the Earth formed?    Next, besides having accepted the Bag Bang as God's creation of the Universe, which is an ad hoc explanation for mating science with religion, you proceed along this same train of thought by accepting evolution as an explantion for the existence for man.  Yet the Earth existed for four billion years before Homo Sapiens existed, thus further complicating the shoehorning of the Six Days of Creation into science.    The concept of a week having seven days because it so neatly fits the story of creation is assuredly a man-made construct.  There is nothing in nature that operates on a weekly basis.  And what do we make of the ancient Egyptians with their ten-day week?    On the other hand, shoehorning religion into science is a freedom afforded every human being.  I used to do it myself.

But if the term 'world' were taken in context as meaning the area known to the writers, then, indeed, all of that world might have been flooded.

7uAB1gAWaa	Well this should be an easy answer but it is hard to explain.    In terms of physics, energy is conserved.  When the 'flubber' is dropped, it has only potential energy right before it is dropped.  You can think of this as the flubber having the potential to be accelerated toward the ground by gravity.  It has the potential to gain 'kinetic' energy (the energy of something in motion).    It has been proven that energy is conserved.  Therefore, in the very best scenario, the flubber will bounce off of the floor  back to it's original height.  The initial potential energy would have been converted to kinetic energy right before it hit the ground and then that kinetic energy would be converted back to the initial potential energy (assuming no loss of energy due to the flubber's interaction with the ground).  It could at best go just as high as it started.  No higher.    In simpler terms, there is no way anything can gain energy when it is dropped on the ground or thrown against the ground for that matter.    And ignore the first respondent.  The same force acts on an object whether it is traveling upwards or downwards, just the sign is different.|`|4PkRRHEtaa	OK, then you tell us how we can be sure Woody, Buzz, and other action figures won't suddenly jump to life and take over the world.    EDIT: To the above posters, maybe the flubber undergoes chemical or sub-atomic changes that provide the required kinetic energy, so I doubt the laws of conservation, reaction, etc. apply here.|`|OOzadIJFaa	well it is truly simple.  it takes more energy to gain altitude(height above sea level or ground) then what is gained losing it|`|VAsHqPNJaa	For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

KJHw0oI3aa	(a) The balanced equation is    2 C2H2(g) + 5 O2(g) --> 4 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)    (b) Start with 1.0 mol of C2H2.  Use dimensional analysis to convert it to moles of CO2.    [(1.0 mol C2H2)/1][(4 mol CO2)/(2 mol C2H4)] = 2 moles of CO2 formed    (c) Start with 1.0 mol of C2H2.  Use dimensional analysis to convert it to moles of O2.    [(1.0 mol C2H2)/1][(5 mol O2)/(2 mol C2H4)] = 2.5 moles of O2 consumed

(no "cherry diet", etc.)    Total = 12 + 8 + 10 + 6  + 8 + x caffeine-free diet  diet = 10 + x    (10 + x) / (44 + x) = 0.44  solve for x, then round to an integer  the "44%" is not exact.    2)  5 + 4 + 9 total  4 rap  4 / 18 = 2/9    3)  Judging by the names there are 2 boys and 2 girls.  So we want to know how many arrangements are B G G B    Total arrangements = 24 which is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 or 4!  If it ends up B G G B  Then there are 2 choices for the first boy  and 2 choices for the first girl,  and that determines the rest uniquely  So we have 2 x 2 / 4! = 1/6    4) Between 1 and 100 there are 50 numbers divisible by 2.  There are 98/7 = 14 numbers divisible by 7.  But the answer is not 64/100.  Why not ?  Because of pesky old 14, that's why!  All the multiples of 14 were counted both times.  There are 7 of those guys, so we better take off 7 from our count.    Final answer: 57/100

AA10306863	They are specialists, feeding on jellyfish. Very few animals can feed on jellyfish because of the stingers on them and because a jellyfish is mainly made up of water so there is little nutrition to be gained from eating one for most predators that do not specialize in eating them. The way the internal physiology works has to be a bit unique to derive nutrition from such a meal. With jellyfish numbers being kept in check the jellyfish don't dominate the oceans and eat every small fish in sight.

Gnfc4wRlaa	According to the doomsday hoaxers, the end of the world.  According to scientists, nothing.    Nothing is going to happen in 2012 any more than any other year.  I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the Hysteria Channel.  If you pay attention and listen carefully, you will hear all the "weasel words" like "may be", "could", etc.  The entire program was done that way. Their "experts" didn't actually say that anything was going to happen. They didn't give any actual Bible verses to support their theory, and all the Nostradamus "quotes" weren't what he actually wrote. They were what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012.  Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being promulgated to sell books.  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.   It is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.    Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.  Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|Yfjh3kBAaa	You really want to know?

Astrologists say that we would be entering into what is called the dark plate which the Mayans who named it thus, predict as the harbinger of our apocalypse. Truth is, the dark plate is where our super massive black hole is rotating so fast that it has flattened itself into a disc, this in turn create a gab between the top and bottom of our galaxy where the gravity created is intense enough to affect anything that enters. This is believed to be the cause of the whole 2012 prediction by the Mayans because the gravity would cause pattern changes within our solar system, creating dangerous weather unlike anything we have seen before and a lot of other cool stuff.    Personally I don't think it will be that intense as many people believe. If anything it will paced out thing where the gravity will not really affect anything. A few strange weather and seismic events would be the most we see, but nothing apocalyptic.|`|a9ef65eaf779962d4dab5e79cff5e703aa	galactic solar eclipse,  our sun lines up with the center of the milkyway galaxy|`|v7Wflu78aa	American presidential election.

l9jPfPCFaa	Sometimes it seems the laws of physics contradict themselves! I don't see any reason why the speed of light could not be broken with the sufficient amount of energy propelling the object, although the amount of energy required would have to be astronomical. Since it hasn't been achieved yet, and there is no proof of alternate dimensions, my best guess is that the result would be like exceeding the sound barrier. Probably a huge flash of light when the light barrier was broken due to compressed light energy, then the object would probably become invisible itself while the image of the object continued to move at the speed of light. Also, I would think there could be some kind of radioactive energy effect, since light is a form of radiation, but what that effect would be, I can't imagine.

NQLfzZ1eaa	Porosity is the amount of pore space, or empty space in a rock.    Lots of things can determine the amount of pore space.  Intrusive igneous rocks have virtually no pore space (unless they are fractured after they reach the earth's surface) because they are formed of crystals that grew in a molten liquid and filled the entire space.    Sediments and sedimentary rocks and soil are a different case.      Sediments are just grains or fragments of natural material.  When the fragments are collected into a mass of sediment, the sediment will have a higher or lower porosity depending on:  - the shape of the grains (irregular shapes create more pore space, compared to spheres, for example which make a lower porosity sediment mass.  - the sorting of the sediment - sorting refers to whether the grains are all the same size or a mixture of sizes ( poor sorting, with big and small grains mixed together allows the small grains to fill in the spaces between the big grains so there is less porosity).  These are the two main factors and they control the porosity of soils as well as rocks.    In sedimentary rocks, the amount of cement that is precipitated in the rock affects porosity also, the more cement, the less porosity.|`|RGC2aDf2aa	no idea honey...

2lQ8DJAcaa	In the total absence of sunlight, there are biological communities that live on these volcanic systems. One of the most amazing discoveries of the last 50 years was made in 1977 by Robert Ballard in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) deep-submergence vehicle Alvin. When he dived down to a hydrothermal vent near the Galapagos Islands, he found a whole ecosystem down there, including bacteria, tubeworms, shrimp, crabs, mussels, clams, octo-puses, and fisheverything but plants. Until this find, no one knew that it was possible to have biological communities that were not based on photosynthesis. The animals are feeding on bacteria that get their energy from reactive chemicals in the hot water coming out of the vents. Heat coming out of the earth can provide energy to support life, just like heat from the sun can. Its life, but its a hard life. It requires some pretty fancy biological tricks to exploit these chemical reactions for metabolism, and most organisms can tolerate only a limited range in temperature. Each species needs to find the right distance from a high-temperature vent, and when the vent position shifts, theyre likely to get cooked (theres a spot on the ridge known as the tubeworm barbecue), frozen out, or covered in lava. Its now become a popular belief that these deep-sea vents may have been where life originatedas hostile as they seem to us, they would have been a much less hostile environment than the earths surface four billion years ago. And, by the way, evidence for a liquid water ocean beneath the ice on Jupiters moon Europa has excited a great deal of speculation, because hydrothermal energy sources could make that world one of the only other places in the solar system able to support life|`|HdJpc3QDaa	Wow that was a big answer, Elizabeth.  :-)    I'm going to make mine simple...Extremophiles.

Gnfc4wRlaa	The current recycling of the fictional Planet X is for it to hit Earth in 2012.  It is supposed to be a giant planet in the outer Solar System.  Please note, in this old article, that Planet X was predicted to encounter Earth in 2003.  In reality, Planet X does not exist.  After 2012 is past and the hype dies down, I'm sure this tired old horse will be flogged back to life for a new doomsday prediction.  After all, they do need to sell their books.    "Doomsayers seem to pop up every few years. Last time, it was the alignment of the planets that somehow managed not to destroy the Earth in May 2000. Now, we have Planet X. A few people are claiming that a heretofore unknown planet in our solar system is on a very long, elliptical orbit. In May 2003, it will pass close enough to the Earth to affect it in some way, causing it to flip over (what many call a "pole shift") and spur many other huge disasters. The end result will be the deaths of many billions of people. There are a large number of web pages, chat rooms and books about Planet X and its horrible effects on the Earth. So the question is, does this planet exist, and will it come by in May 2003 and cause all this horror?  No, and no."    "Let me be very clear here: Nancy Lieder, Mark Hazlewood and the rest of these Planet X people (hereafter referred to as "PXPs") are completely wrong. No rogue giant planet is about to destroy the Earth, in May 2003 or otherwise.    Zechariah Sitchin bases his entire theory of the existence of a tenth planet on ancient texts, including Sumerian and biblical writings. However, he is known to misinterpret Sumerian, sometimes grossly. His key finding is based on a seal that shows a diagram that looks like the solar system, with the Sun at the center. It appears to have eleven planets around it. Since Sumerians counted the Sun and Moon as planets, Sitchin says the extra one must be some unknown planet. He also says it has aliens on it who communicated with the ancient Sumerians.    For Planet X to be here in less then a decade, it can't be farther than a billion or so kilometers away. Even at that distance, it would be one of the brightest objects in the sky. Remember, tiny Pluto is 5 billion kilometers out, and can be easily detected using modern equipment, and Pluto is way smaller than Planet X is supposed to be.

GUOsn4BFaa	As health care providers, we've heard every excuse imaginable from patients wanting to get out of work, but if a patient is genuinely sick--we must allow a patient time to recover no matter the reason.  If a patient visits their doctor with a legitimate medical concern, he has an ethical responsibility to do whatever it is that is in the best interest of the patient.  If the patient feels that they would benefit from bed rest for a few days, the doctor will typically issue a work release, even if the cause was an alcoholic binge.  If it becomes habitual a doctor may become more reluctant to issue work releases, and more likely to refer the patient to seek treatment at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility.

In my junior year of HS, I had an allergic reaction to rectal suppositories. It started in the middle of the night when my tongue would not stay in my mouth. I went upstairs to tell my mom (I was freaking out and thought I was being posessed). She told me to stop being weird and sent me back to bed. It stopped and off I went to school in the morning. During snack period, my face started to hurt and my friends realized I had been very stiffly smiling for like the last 10 minutes (I hadn't noticed). Then, in 3rd period, my tongue kept popping out again, so I clapped my hand over my mouth and hoped nobody would notice. So by lunch, I am just walking around with my hand over my mouth trying not to make eye contact with anyone I know. That didn't work. Soon a large crowd had formed around me yelling "She's gonna hurl!" and other such things. Apparently, I had tried to block my head because my arm was now oddly twisted at my face. My mom came to get me and kept screaming in the car "you better not be on drugs! Look at me!!!!" (My eyes would only look to the left and downward) After arriving at Urgent Care, my hand quickly started to twist itself into a claw and I started to scream. I was rushed to a room , where a nurse injected me with Benadryl. Apparently, I was 1 out of 1000 to whom this medication can break down the central nervous system. It took quite awhile to explain everything at school. You try starting a sentence with "So I had an allergic reaction to my rectal suppositories!"|`|2rTo7Xkhaa	do you mean embarrassing? because otherwise i dont know what you are asking, something embarrassing for me was when i thought i was called up for an award and went in front of my whole high school to find out i misunderstood the teacher who was announcing.

What goes through the membrane is largely dependent on the size and molecule's charge. This is because the cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer.

jDU3e3Yaaa	To find the limiting reagent you have to know the mole-mole ratio of the reactants at the very least.|`|Wv2CXTpEaa	There is no way to figure out what the limiting reagent is without knowing the chemical equation. This is because the ratio of reactants is not always 1:1    You must first derive the (balanced) equation by looking at the reactants and products.    Of course, if you have an infinite number of one reactant and a finite number of another reactant, the finite one will be the limiting one. An example of that would be a combustion reaction under normal conditions - in which O2 is for all intents and purposes infinite.
IdGe1JWyaa	I still use calculus, it might not be heavy duty calculus but I still take simple integrals, etc.  I guess it depends on what field you get into in Civil Engineering.  I do use statistics and numerical methods more than I use calculus.    Civil engineers use computers as a tool and do not let the computer do all the work.  Civil engineers need to understand the equations so they know the purpose and limitations of those equations and you need calculus to understand that.  That and it is civil engineers that program most of those computers.  A lot of they equations they come up with involve differential equations that have been simplified down to equations that can be easily used everyday.

If someone throws a baseball or a rock they are actually picking up a physical thing ( an item that exist that you can hold) They are throwing it ..right through the window. That thing, the baseball in this case, once it is thrown a force is what causes it to move. The energy will drive it forward until the energy is used up. This baseball goes through the glass and breaks it..that is a physical change to a physical thing.     In plain words, I throw the ball and the energy keeps it going forward. It hits the window and breaks it. that ball is a real thing .. a physical thing. The change to the glass was phsical     Rust is different. that is not something trrown at it that caused the rust to form. It is not a case of cutting a pipe or bending it or anything I could do physically to that pipe will not cause the rust to form. That formed on a molecular level, it is the reaction of two chemicals coming together and changes the metal and this is what is left afterward.    Acid will burn you it is because of the chemical reaction between the chemicals and one's flesh.   A bat will break your arm because of the physical change it caused to your arm - that change is fuel by energy. For physical change to happen there is a thing that brought about the change, that thing is driven by energy.

So it has be plowed and swept from roads, parking lots, roofs, etc.    It is abrasive and irritating in your sinuses and lungs so when it is in the air and if the wind kicks it up later, people should stay inside or use dust masks outside.    It silts up streams and very close to the volcano can be a lot of sediment load in a watershed.  That effects fish in the rivers and the whole aquatic ecosystem when the previously rocky bottomed streams become muddy and silty (salmon and trout need gravel stream beds to breed).    It can shut down air traffic.  Google "747 volcano alaska KLM 1989" and see what can happen if a plane flies through the ash plume.

When we have the prediction of the possibility that it might just maybe kinda could snow 1/2 inch here they close the schools before it even gets cloudy!

The last deep snow we had was 1986 - 11 inches and we had a severe Ice storm in 1994.  But every year we panic like it happens all the time.

Hs1SAeQFaa	Eye color is a polygenic trait - this means that it results from a combination of more than one gene. Because of this, variation exists amongst the phenotypic expression (in this case, the color of your eyes).     To illustrate: my eyes are predominantly greyish-blue, but if you look at them closely, there are brown flecks around my pupil. My mother has brown eyes. My father has blue eyes. My brother's eyes are completely blue.     Here's a couple wikipedia links that might explain a bit more:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic|`|PpuOab4Gaa	It might have something to do with pupil dilation. As the pupil opens wider, some of the color of the iris may appear to be lost. This might be more for the optical category under health though.|`|VGVGwzmzaa	maybe because if ur cold they might change colors or if ur hot they change|`|XvvpS66Kaa	It is genetically determinated which eye color you have. It is not unusual to find people with different colors in the eyes, in your case two different coulors in both.   There are people who have different colors in each of the eyes, for example one eye hazel one eye blue, or radial zones of green or blue in the otherwise hazel eye. It looks really funny.

MKrx6a2saa	An erg is a unit of energy used in the CGS (centimeter gram second) unit system.  Its base units are g*cm^2/s^2.    You cannot convert watts to ergs, as the watt is a measure of power.  I assume you want to know how many joules (the SI unit of energy) are equal to one erg.    1 erg = 1 g*cm^2/s^2 * (1kg/1000g) * (1m/100cm)^2 = 10^(-7) J = 0.0000001 J|`|AA11668123	Watts are not a unit of energy, but power.    An erg of energy = 1 dyne?cm.  This is the natural unit of energy in the cgs system of units.

Anyway, first, the bread turns brown, which is a chemical change, that is to say some of the molecules undergo slight permanent change in structure because of the fire -- which gives it the golden brown color.    Second, the cheese melts, which is a physical change.

YjfGt6b0aa	Hi this is a very important thing to know if you ask me, I also like graphic designe.  Understand quarter-inch scale. Quarter inch scale is based in the ? inch measurement on a ruler. In quarter inch scale, ? inch on a ruler is equal to on foot. So for every foot you measure in a room, you transfer ? inch to your drawing. Graph paper is used to draw quarter inch scale drawings, because the boxes on graph paper are typically ? inch square making the transfer of measurements easy.|`|AA10332086	You are not using a true scale because the items you describe are not in proportion their real dimensions.     You say one square is one foot. If that is true and you draw a toiler as being one foot square, you are in error. More obvious is a bathtub that is 2 squares of 2 foot long. Bath tubs are much longer than than. Stairs are certainly not only 4 foot long.     I suggest you get yourself an architect scale and use it to measure the dimensions on your drawings. It has many scales ranging from 1/8 inch = a foot to one and a half inch equals a foot.|`|b59dj0dtaa	Measure the grid size.

1UPwDfJgaa	there's a chemical reaction occuring within the battery when the cathode (+ side) and anode (- side) are connected.  The cathode draws the electrons created from the reaction toward it and away from the anode.  Eventually this chemical reaction weakens because the compounds necassary for it to occur are converted into something else.      For example, in a lead acid (lead and sulfuric acid) battery, lead (Pb) is converted to PbSO4 and one electron by the reaction between the 2.  Eventually all of the lead is converted to PbSO4 which can't create electrons on it's own    A simplified early version of the battery, known as the galvanic cell, is an easy google search away and will help you understand it better|`|rgovWVP4aa	dry cells or old age early cold starting and heaters radios windows working all the time will drain the battery , a faulty alternator not charging the battery as you drive leaky battery   or leaving lights in over night

wDMWkYUcaa	Initially, the ball is travelling with the canon, so both have the same horizontal speed. When the ball is shot vertically, the ball moves up, but its horizontal speed does not change because gravity only acts in the downward direction and because wind and air resistance is assumed to be absent. If nothing is present to speed up or slow down the ball in the horizontal direction, then it will maintain its original horizontal speed. Therefore, the ball falls back into the cannon since their horizontal positions will always be the same.

The snow formed at just below the freezing point is fluffier than snow formed at lower temperatures.

Law of Independent Assortment - During meiosis, the gene pairs are sorted into one gamete or another independently of how other gene pairs are sorted, e.g., tall/short allele for height gene is sorted independently of purple/white allele for flower color gene.      Note:  The Law of Independent Assortment only holds true if the two gene pairs are located on different pairs of homologous chromosomes. Alleles for linked genes (i.e., genes located on the same chromosome) are usually inherited as a "package, unless crossing over "unlinks" genes. The closer the two loci on a chromosome, the less likely they are to be "unlinked" by crossing over. The farther away the two loci, the more often they will be separated by crossing over. This fact can be used to help map the loci of genes on chromosomes; this technique is called linkage mapping.|`|fmr98EBtaa	1) 1/4. The flipping of a coin is an independent event, meaning that the first flip does not effect the outcome of the second flip.

Meaning, for example, that all hybrid (SsYY) smooth yellow peas do not have to transfer their allele for smoothness and yellowness together. They could give an unexpressed green allele (as it is recessive) and a dominant yellow allele.

AA10348639	Water has three states, one of which is liquid water and another of which is ice water. Below freezing water is a solid (ice or snowflakes), between freezing and boiling water is a liquid, and above its boiling point water is a gas. There are words scientists use to describe water changing from one state to another. Water changing from solid to liquid is said to be melting. When it changes from liquid to gas it is evaporating. Water changing from gas to liquid is called condensation (An example is the 'dew' that forms on the outside of a glass of cold soda). Frost formation is when water changes from gas directly to solid form. When water changes directly from solid to gas the process is called sublimation.   Most liquids contract (get smaller) when they get colder. Water is different. Water contracts until it reaches 4 C then it expands until it is solid. Solid water is less dense that liquid water because of this. If water worked like other liquids, then there would be no such thing as an ice berg, the ice in your soft drink would sink to the bottom of the glass, and ponds would freeze from the bottom up!   Water is found on Earth in all three forms. This is because Earth is a very special planet with just the right range of temperatures and air pressures. Earth is said to be at the triple point for water.     Basically, to sum it all up, water and ice still have the same molecular composition, it's just that they are in different physical states of matter. It doesn't actually make the water form different just because it is liquid or solid. This is because if you break each of them down, you will still get two hydrogens and one oxygen. I know you said not to say anything about H2O, but its part of the answer. Hope this helps!|`|YYbVDcw8aa	How is your hand and your fist the same?|`|RldrI0ATaa	becuz when water freezes its ice, when it melts its water!

ZLFgVHreaa	Well depending on color, if it's a sunny day, and you're wearing a dark shirt, you'll be more warmer than a lighter colored shirt. Lets say, you wear a darker shirt, and the weather is more than warm, most likely you'll be irritated and moody compared to a lighter colored shirt.   Also a tighter shirts or clothing that fits tightly around the body on a more than warm day, also makes people get warm. Looser shirts are better.     On cooler days, darker shirts tend to keep you warmer. Tighter shirts (like a fitting tee or long sleeves) feel better than looser clothing.

2lQ8DJAcaa	One and one-half acres of rainforest are lost every second with tragic consequences for both developing and industrial countries.     Rainforests are being destroyed because the value of rainforest land is perceived as only the value of its timber by short-sighted governments, multi-national logging companies, and land owners.     Nearly half of the world's species of plants, animals and microorganisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century due to rainforest deforestation.     Experts estimates that we are losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day due to rainforest deforestation. That equates to 50,000 species a year. As the rainforest species disappear, so do many possible cures for life-threatening diseases. Currently, 121 prescription drugs sold worldwide come from plant-derived sources. While 25% of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients, less that 1% of these tropical trees and plants have been tested by scientists.     Most rainforests are cleared by chainsaws, bulldozers and fires for its timber value and then are followed by farming and ranching operations, even by world giants like Mitsubishi Corporation, Georgia Pacific, Texaco and Unocal.

AA6Aq94vaa	It's not so much the concentration of water within a cell membrane but the concentration of solute dissolved by the water. The solute and the water that dissolved it will seek equilibrium, and in order to do so they will try to be in equal parts throughout.   If there is a cell membrane in between that blocks the solute but not the water only the water will travel across the membrane . So if the solute is more concentrated on one side, water will flow to that side until equilibrium is reached
cHhEC9fpaa	The initial energy at point "a" is the kinetic (KEa) plus electrostatic potential (Ua) energy    Ea = KEa + Ua    The final energy at point "b" is     Eb = KEb + Ub    The difference between the final and the initial energy is the work (W) done    W = Eb - Ea = (KEb + Ub) - (KEa + Ua)    we are told the object is initially at rest so KEa = 0    W = KEb + (Ub -  Ua)    Thus potential energy difference is     Ub - Ua = W - KEb = 2.5 mJ - 0.471 mJ = 2.029 mJ     The electrostatic potential energy and the potential V are related by U = QV, so     Ub - Ua = Q(Vb - Va)      Vb - Va = (Ub - Ua)/Q = 2.029x10^(-3)/ -7.25x10^(-6)     Vb - Va = -279.9 volts.

lsUMe5WVaa	Most non-renewable energy source are much cheaper to use than renewable sources.    Relative to nuclear power, it's still true that some non-renewable are cheaper (mainly coal power), but its not as big a difference.

UAYzLyN4aa	Think of it like a window. If you block off half of the window, you can still see everything beyond the window, yes? But you do have to get closer.     With the hologram it is similar. The light from the original scene (don't think of it as an "image", it is not) contributes to the entire hologram. If you cut the hologram into pieces you can still see all of the original scene from each.. if you get close enough...     however, what you see through the pieces will fuzzier - less well focused than before, something like lower resolution in a computer image. If you have half the film area you can store only half as much information. In a hologram this shows up as decreased detail rather than decreased view area.  You can't get something for nothing, even with holograms.|`|m2pNTLloaa	Yes. A hologram is the interference pattern of laser beams.  The pattern at every point is what your eye would see if it had been at that point looking at the object.  Thus every point contains all the information about the object.  BUT, no 2 points are exactly the same.    You are confused because you are used to seeing images made up of "pixels" that contain only information about one point on the object.  Holograms are more like millions of cameras stacked side by side.  Each camera has a complete image from its point of view.
TOiQmkbvaa	put a point anywhere on a piece of paper, probly the middle would do best.  Then draw a line 65 units in length in the positive x direction (to the right) starting at the point.  then draw a line 120 units in length in the negative y direction (down) starting at the end of the x line.    Next, connect the original point to the end of the 2nd line.  If you did this right, you should have formed a right triangle.      The length of the third line you drew is the magnitude, and the direction of the line is the direction.    Magnitude = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(65^2 + 120^2)  direction is tan-1(-120/65).  This angle is measured clockwise from the positive x-axis.

WRyHOEjSaa	First off, you could believe that God created the first matter as well as the first life, and still be an evolutionist.  Evolution only addresses the means by which all the species after the first came to be.  Charles Darwin himself, wrote in the last paragraph of On the Origin of Species: There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.  You could also believe that God subtly guides evolution - making sure the necessary mutations show up when needed; sending an asteroid to wipe out the dinosaurs and allow mammals to evolve in their place; etc.  The one thing evolution shows regarding God is that the species after the first could have come into being naturally.  If God was ultimately responsible, He wasnt obvious about it, and He used natural means.      > Isn't there a law that states matter is never created or destoyed it only changes forms?? So who created it to begin with?? How did it get there to get all "big banged" up..    Right, that would be the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the total energy (which is a form of matter according to E = mc squared) in an isolated system remains constant, although it can change form http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatio...  .  Unfortunately we dont know if that rule holds inside a singularity (black hole), which is what the very early universe may have been.     Furthermore, as far as I understand it, nothing in the model requires matter or energy to have been created by the big bang. Im also not aware of any model that supposes matter and energy came from nothing.  The three assumptions Ive seen are that it was always there in the singularity prior to the big bang; that it came from a previous universe http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200... ; and that it came from the kinetic energy resulting from the collision of two pre-existing membrane-like universal spaces http://wwwphy.princeton.edu/~steinh/npr/ .  None of these are generally accepted, however, because there is insufficient evidence to give clear support to one over another.  Accordingly, scientists are seeking additional evidence.    > and in the history of everything has there ever been a case where a rock, a particle of air, or clump of mud have ever "evolved" into something living?? If not.. why is it so widely believed that this is the case?    A rock couldnt evolve into something living because evolution applies to populations of self-replicating individuals, not to individual rocks. However, the Miller-Urey experiment (and others) have shown that complex organic molecules would have been available, so all that remains is to figure out how those molecules could have assembled into something that was self-replicating, so that evolution could take over.  We dont yet know how that happened, but we are making progress.  See for instance:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis .    http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...    As for why abiogenesis of some type is widely believed to have happened, it would depend on what you meant by believed. I believe it probably happened, because of the progress made to date and the lack of any other examples of supernatural creation. But I dont believe it religiously, nor do I believe that any particular model of abiogenesis has anything comparable to the level of evidenciary support backing up the theory of evolution.      I also think many religious people accept that some form of abiogenesis occurred, with the caveat that the natural processes that made it possible were originally created by God.  Similarly, I think a lot of religious people can accept that stars form and ignite because large amounts of interstellar dust collapse inwards towards a common center and compact due to gravity to the point where the hydrogen atoms begin to fuse. Ive yet to see someone say it couldnt have happened that way because thats not how its described in Genesis. If religious people can say Yes, God formed the stars by using gravity, I dont see why they cant say Yes, God formed the first life using chemistry, or Yes, God formed all life-forms after the first using evolution.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	The basis of intelligent design      Paraphrasing the creation story and approximate history until today  (Extremely old school style)    By David Watts 2/09    (Literal) Day 1 Genesis 1:1-5 states that God created the earth.  On this first day the earth was a void in space staring at the sun.  This was not the earth we know today.  No plants and animals, a complete barren ball of water as land had not yet been introduced.    (Literal) Day 2 Genesis 1:6-8 states that God separated the waters above and below.  A shield of ice or mist was introduced into the atmosphere.  The expanse between the waters was called sky and this was the second day.  Basically, this is when He made our atmosphere.    (Literal) Day 3 Genesis 1:9-13 states that God created land and divided it from the water.  The world looked somewhat Pangea like in form, as the continents were all together.  God than created all the plant life we see today.    (Literal) Day 4 Genesis 1:14-19 states that God created the stars in the sky and the moon and set the revolution of the earth in motion around the sun.  The Earth was not capable of sustaining life before this step.    (Literal) Day 5 Genesis 1:20-23 states that God created the creatures of the sea and the air and he blessed them.  Incidentally, this is the first blessing in the Bible.      (Literal) Day 6 Genesis 1:24-31 states that God created all the land animals and than humans and gave us humans dominion over the Earth and told us to take care of it.    (Literal) Day 7 Genesis 2:1-3 states that God rested on the seventh day and made it holy as an example for us to use one day a week as a day of rest.    There was about 2000 years between the great flood when the waters above came and flooded the land and creation.  Before the flood, people lived to be several hundred years old and the differing atmospheric conditions allowed for constant growth.  As for dinosaurs, there were never any different species than what we see today.  For example, if my dog never stopped growing over his 600-year life Im sure hed be as big as a house!  These truths have often been cast aside but never disproven.    During the flood the earth below the waters broke apart creating the continents we have today.  The flood also dramatically changed the atmosphere, as there is no longer water above the earth.  The new atmosphere accounts for the differing atmospheric changes and climate we see today as before the flood the earth would have been fairly temperate.    After the flood there was 2000 years before God came to Earth in the form of Jesus.  It has almost been 2000 years since Jesus came.  His return is foretold in Revelation and many prophesies about that return are being fulfilled now.

If you deny the established science you had better have a great alternative that can be fully backed and proved.  There is NO science existing that disproves evolution.      You made a error.  There is no such thing as an Evolutionist.  You see, evolution is not a religion nor philosophy.  There term is being used by Christians in a derogatory fashion to label anyone that accepts evolution.      Evolution is not about the beginning of life.  It is about how life has change over the billions of years it has existed on Earth.  Many existing Laws and Theories are used by Creationist wrongly in an attempt to sway people away from science.  Such as the Law of Thermodynamics.  Which you mention and you obviously do not understand.      No person, no spirit, no mystical magical wizard created anything.  Yes, life on this planet is just the fortunate combination of several factors within the proper conditions.      Evolution is accepted simply because it is fully support science.  Science has never attempted to tell religious people that Evolution is the source of life.  Science never attempts to argue with religion about anything.  Science is based on common sense.

I tried to type up an answer myself, but I'm not all that great at putting complex scientific stories into words without doing a LOT of extra fact checking.    The origins of life have a lot to do with stars, too, so you may also want to look into this.'  Ever heard the phrase "We are star dust"?  Or "We are star dust pondering star dust"?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars    Also, you may want to see if you can get your hands on the book Cosmos, though the old TV series is also very worth watching.    Keep looking, keep investigating, and never let arrogance or fear (yours or other's) get between you and the truth.      Edit:  Jim makes some excellent points, but I'd like to put into view that Science isn't based on common sense, it's based on the scientific method  http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fa...    Also, 'common sense' is a sort of misleading word.  Albert Einstein was onto something when he said "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen."|`|ZlOF7pPgaa	Believing in creationism instead of evolution is not required for Christians though many may telly you that is the case.     "Where did it all come from?" If you are referring to life, this is actually an issue typically viewed as separate from biological evolution often referred to as "chemical evolution" or abiogenesis. There is less scientific consensus regarding the origin of life than there is regarding evolution mainly because it is less testable/ observable than evolution.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis    Abiogenesis is just "matter changing forms," it is still a collection of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, just in a different rearrangement. It does nothing to violate the laws of thermodynamics (ie matter being created or destroyed) since nothing has been created.

And 2+ is the ion charge.    Okay, protons and electrons will always be the same number as the atomic number. So in this case you have 28 protons and 28 electrons because the atomic number is 28.    To find neutrons, subtract the number of protons from the atomic mass.    So, 58-28 = 30    30 protons.

At some point in robotics you will have to be able to do the math to find the position of the end of the robot arm.  This involves A LOT of equations, and the easiest way to deal with this many equations is to put them into matrix form.  It makes it easier not only to do by hand, but also to program into the robot controller.    From the science end you will want to learn at least the basics of electromagnetism.  When you build robots you will have power wires running to the motors of the robot, as well as signal wires going to the sensors to read the robot's position.  If these wires are not run properly electromagnetic interference will screw up your sensors.

No other land animal comes close to the size of these creatures. It would take 165 full-grown men to make up the same weight as the world's record African elephant (see Awesome Stats at left). The noise of an elephant digesting its food (when its tummy's growling) can be heard up to 600ft/183m away.

zYXMatXgaa	because when iron turns into rust it is no longer iron it has now become iron oxide... a physical change of iron would be like melting iron or cutting it... the remaining products are still just iron...|`|yWoBYJVEaa	Daniel, above, is right.    In this case, the question is probably asking about the PROCESS, not the result.  Chemistry is very much focused on how and why things happen - on the process of change.      Obviously, an iron pole that has rusted has changed - both in appearance and form.  It looks red and ugly, and is all powdery, and bumpy.    However, the process that caused the change is a chemical process, - an oxidation reaction - not a physical act like cutting or breaking it.      A physical change (to a chemist) would be heating the iron pole up until it melted, turned into a liquid.  Or, heating it up even hotter until it vaporized.        So, the deterioration (rusting) of the iron pole would be called a chemical process, not a physical process.      It can be perplexing if all you do is look at the end result.  You need to look at how the result occurs, as well - whether it is a chemical change,or simply a physical change.

7htMu63haa	Cl2 is neutral, and it is an oxidizer the pH of it is nothing, it does not have a hydrogen bond so therefore it cannnot be acidic or basic.  I hope i have helped.|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	Chlorine is the chemical element with atomic number 17 and symbol Cl. It is a halogen, found in the periodic table in group 17 (formerly VII, VIIa, or VIIb). As the chloride ion, which is part of common salt & other compounds, it is abundant in nature and necessary to most forms of life, including humans. In its common elemental form (Cl2 or "Dichlorine") under standard conditions, it is a pale green gas about 2.54 times as dense as air. It has a disagreeable, suffocating odor that is detectable in concentrations as low as 1 ppm & is choking and poisonous. Chlorine is a powerful oxidant and is used in bleaching and disinfectants. As a common disinfectant, chlorine compounds are used in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing molecules have been implicated in the destruction of the ozone layer. At standard temperature and pressure, two chlorine atoms form the diatomic molecule Cl2. This is a pale yellow-green gas that has its specific strong smell. The bonding between the two atoms is relatively weak (only of 242.580 0.004 kJ/mol) which makes the Cl2 molecule highly reactive.  Along with fluorine, bromine, iodine and astatine, chlorine is a member of the halogen series that forms the group 17 of the periodic table - most reactive group of elements. It combines readily with nearly all elements.  Compounds with oxygen, nitrogen, xenon, and krypton are known, but do not form by direct reaction of the elements. Chlorine, though very reactive, is not as extremely reactive as fluorine. Pure chlorine gas does, however, support combustion of organic compounds such as hydrocarbons, although the carbon component tends to burn incompletely, with much of it remaining as soot. At 10 C and atmospheric pressure, 1 liter of water dissolves 3.103 L of gaseous chlorine, and at 30 C, 1 L of water dissolves only 1.77 liters of chlorine.  Chlorine is a member of the salt-forming halogen series and is extracted from chlorides through oxidation often by electrolysis. With metals, it forms salts called chlorides. As the chloride ion, Cl?, it is also the most abundant dissolved ion in ocean water. Chlorine exists in all odd numbered oxidation states from ?1 to +7, as well as the elemental state of zero. Progressing through the states, hydrochloric acid can be oxidized using manganese dioxide, or hydrogen chloride gas oxidized catalytically by air to form elemental chlorine gas. The solubility of chlorine in water is increased if the water contains dissolved alkali hydroxide. This is due to disproportionation:  Cl2 + 2OH?  Cl? + ClO? + H2O  In hot concentrated alkali solution disproportionation continues:  2ClO?  Cl? + ClO2?  ClO? + ClO2?  Cl? + ClO3?  Sodium chlorate and potassium chlorate can be crystallized from solutions formed by the above reactions. If their crystals are heated, they undergo the final disproportionation step.  4ClO3?  Cl? + 3ClO4?  This same progression from chloride to perchlorate can be accomplished by electrolysis. Elemental chlorine is an oxidizer. It undergoes halogen substitution reactions with lower halide salts. For example, chlorine gas bubbled through a solution of bromide or iodide anions oxidizes them to bromine and iodine respectively.  Like the other halogens, chlorine participates in free-radical substitution reactions with hydrogen-containing organic compounds. This reaction is often  but not invariably  non-regioselective, and hence may result in a mixture of isomeric products. It is often difficult to control the degree of substitution as well, so multiple substitutions are common. If the different reaction products are easily separated, e.g. by distillation, substitutive free-radical chlorination (in some cases accompanied by concurrent thermal dehydrochlorination) may be a useful synthetic route. Industrial examples of this are the production of methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride from methane, allyl chloride from propylene, and trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene from 1,2-dichloroethane.  Like the other halides, chlorine undergoes electrophilic additions reactions, most notably, the chlorination of alkenes and aromatic compounds with a Lewis acid catalyst. Organic chlorine compounds tend to be less reactive in nucleophilic substitution reactions than the corresponding bromine or iodine derivatives, but they tend to be cheaper. They may be activated for reaction by substituting with a tosylate group, or by the use of a catalytic amount of sodium iodide.  Chlorine is used extensively in organic and inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an organic compound, due to its electronegativity.  Chlorine compounds are used as intermediates in the production of a number of important commercial products that do not contain chlorine. Examples are: polycarbonates, polyurethanes, silicones, polytetrafluoroethylen|`|velIdcbNaa	hmm... i thought you just wanted what type it is.  sorry ^.^|`|CGJ68TIXaa	it belongs to acid family

Gnfc4wRlaa	Astronomers have discovered the oldest known planet, a primeval world 12.7 billion years old that will force them to reconsider how and when planets form.  This ancient world is well more than twice the age of Earth and all other known planets. It is nearly as old as the universe itself.    Solar system formation began billions of years ago, when gases and dust began to come together to form the Sun, planets, and other bodies of the solar system.  All the Solar System planets are about the same age.    Mercury's age:  About the same age as the Sun: 4.5 billion years  Neptune age:  About the same age as the Sun: 4.5 billion years  Jupiter age:  About the same age as the Sun: 4.5 billion years|`|JYyOjAqdaa	It would probably be very hard to determine, considering the amount of data that we have about that sh it.  To know the age of something, you need a bit more than just a telescope.  Its even hard to estimate what the age of mars is, even tho theyve put it at around 4.6 billion years, its hard to tell without doing more tests and blah blippity blah.      My best guess is that Jupiter formed when the Sun did, but our Sun achieved fusion first, and the initial blast of solar energy blew away all the stuffs that would have made Jupiter a star, so I'm going to say Jupiter :]|`|wkpLvAntaa	Well, we discovered different planets through observation.  I would assume Earth, since we have not inferred what the other planets' approximate dates are.|`|E0U2yII3aa	Methuselah, as it was dubbed, is a planet that is 12.7 billion years old.

In the Solar System, I think it's Jupiter who became the first to be a full-pledged planet to have accumulated the most mass.

wdBm2lDYaa	Static electricity is generated when plastics ( like those used to make your clothes) are rubbed together to create a charge.  Normally in the summer months there is enough moisture on your skin to drain this charge of electricity.  You also drain this charge through your socks and your shoes but in the winter the humidity has decrease significantly and the charge builds up.    What is the solution to this problem?   Add Fabric softener to your laundry and add fabric softener sheets to the dryer when you dry them. Not only do they reduce static cling but they also reduce static build up as you walk and your clothes rub together.      Use skin moisturizer in both lotion on exposed areas such as the hands and arms.  You can also buy soap that has a moisturizer in it.     Increase the humidity in the room by boiling a pot of water or making soup (gives off moisture as steam) during the winter months if the problem is in your home.|`|e3777758823cb75d71b521312285be66aa	Try adding humidity to your air it should minimize it.  Also depends on the cloths you are wearing.
VqKHo47haa	When technology is taken to a sufficiently advanced level it can resemble what people may think of as magic. At current trends it appears that what we think of as highly advanced or even improbable will become accomplished via newer technologies (technology is basically applied science). Prototype invisibility "meshes" have already been constructed and have been shown to work. They do make people invisible, but there is a catch, the device is very bulky and cannot be worn yet. But if the same principle can be scaled down (which we have managed to do thus far with almost everything), you will essentially gain the ability to be invisible. This project seems highly difficult to scale down though. Basically the way they got it to work was to make a large special glass that curved light around objects inside of it. From a frontal perspective, its as if there is no object present because the light going in to the glass is taken through an altered path, it never hits the object being shielded. Its not easy to curve light and turning the huge mesh in to a piece of cloth is a perplexing problem. But given enough time and money, who knows? As far as the human body is concerned, there are many modifications that can be applied to a person's body that can be thought of as a super power. Over-musculature is just the beginning and is actually not that difficult. Giving people the ability to photosynthesize, so that we'd never starve is becoming highly realistic. Already scientists have discovered ways that can potentially allow people to skip sleeping, heal injuries multiple times faster, and even give the ability to see in the infra-red wavelength (heat vision).|`|zkovxRseaa	the power to fart so hard, you can knock people out|`|2RzOqHObaa	poop boy  go to www.myspace.com/codydcshoes|`|AA12272885	There are no super powers, no magic, it's only science.|`|xm3pnTuvaa	possibly just being psychic|`|DFo4KXB0aa	well theres a guy on youtube who cut his finger off then put a special powder he made over it and over time it regenerated back so i guess maybe regeneration or regrowth of human body parts in about 5 years or so|`|hr0aA12baa	only robotics enhancements|`|EoWS4Xz7aa	super powers what do u mean like flyin, turnin invisible and etc stuff. i don't think they're are any atm but might be in the future who knows what the future holds|`|yOmxDFJOaa	Maybe x-ray or infared vision...because they already have infared goggles and maybe can get some contacts that can transpose the energy from x-rays or infared to visible light!
wvAhCsxqaa	If a cockroach were in the actual blast zone, like any other organism, it would be entirely dissolved in an instant.    However, the most dangerous (in terms of lives impacted) effect of nuclear bombs is the radioactivity that lingers for years afterwards.    Radiation is energy waves that (at certain frequencies) can greatly damage/shuffle the dna sequences in the cells of living organisms.    For some reason the cells of cockroaches are way less susceptible to radiation damage than any other well-known, tangible species.    There is an enormous amount of research being conducted to find out what it is exactly that protects the cockroaches from radiation, because it could greatly impact human lives in the coming years.    Nuclear war along with the corroding ozone layer protecting us from the sun (which blocks a huge amount of dangerous radiation) are just two of the major reasons why understanding cockroaches could help us down the road.|`|xbanK1Q5aa	cockraoches are amazing little critters. in science a few years ago my teacher had them and she would demonstrate that if you cut off a cockroach's head it would still survive for a week... but then it would die of dehydration.|`|AA10303328	Cockroaches are nasty and it is said that they can withstand 10 times the radiation a human can, so maybe that is what they are talking about.

stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

YIy9yu4qaa	I am going to answer you based on what I know and have read, but please do not take this as my beliefs. I don't believe in animal spirits.   The spirit is not literally the spirit of an animal, but its more like a family crest. The spirit appears as this particular animal because it symbolical represents the strengths of that spirit and that spirit guide is attracted to a person because they need those strengths. For example a spirit guide who takes the form of a dog might be offering the gifts of obedience and loyalty. A hawk might be the spirit of freedom and power. They can also appear in various ways such as dreams, visions, or might come to the person in the form of the animal in real life.|`|Q5lHfuakaa	One example that i can give you is butterfly.    The butterfly is great admired among American Indians and is a bringer of joy and peace. Cultures all over earth revere its delicate and colorful beauty. Most butterflies live very short lives, only a week or two, except for the Angle Wing and Monarch live about six months.  They experience stages of development from egg in the cocoon to caterpillar to adult butterfly.      BUTTERFLY MEDICINE    The short life span and beauty of the butterfly is symbolic of early spiritual growth.   Lessons of life will be shown during sometimes difficult formative years and come to light as the butterfly spirit begins to fly.  They hold the gift of transformation and soul evolution.         The butterfly is reminiscent of freedom and creativity.      Butterflies have a pair of large compound oval eyes made up of thousands of individual lenses.  They can see a single image clearly and are able to perceive ultraviolet wavelengths of light.  This suggests clairvoyant abilities for those that hold this totem.     The antennae of the butterfly has small knobs on each end which is said to play a role in orientation.  When one antennae is missing the butterfly will fly in circles unable to find its way.  Those with this medicine need to stay consciously connected to spirit at all times in order to arrive at their desired destination.      Butterflies are not very organized, often return to the same flower many times before they realize it, and cannot remember relatives.  This trait shows us to be better prepared for life's challenges and relationships.      The butterfly represents the process of transformation and shape shifting.  When butterfly shows up, make note of the most important issues confronting you at the moment.  What state of change are you at in regard to them?     Butterflies remind us not to take life so seriously. They feed on flowers that they help pollinate, thereby further spreading beauty. They represent the element of air, quickly changing and ever moving, so gracefully.  Butterflies are messengers of the moment. They come in a variety of colors. To understand the message that the butterfly holds for you a study of its colors can be helpful.     Whenever an eco system is damaged, butterfly is usually the first to leave. They are especially sensitive to the harmony of earth. If butterfly comes to you in a hurt, trapped or ill way, you are being asked to stop disturbing the natural design of life and to flow with events in a more gentle, natural way.|`|GjrM3aRXaa	I think spirit guides, are like symbol of your personality as what's your weaknesses and strengths, which correspond to an animals integrated description and attitude.    It becomes a guide since it reminds you to believe in yourself and do what your heart dictates you.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Wushaboy has an interesting point, that animal spirit guides can be representations of something else.   It bring to mind Karl Jung's concept of archetypes.  Concepts like justice and love  are archetypes, for example, and humanity has a great capacity for animating concepts as gods.  Why not as animal spirit guides?|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Willy wagtail?  You Australians have the best names.|`|24H5tznkaa	Um, well for the record, this isn't a new thing. The Native Americans have always believed in animal totems and animal spirits. You can call on the spirit of an animal for their strengths.     Each of us also have an animal we are aligned with. As TR was saying, I am the Owl but I could learn a lot from the Hummingbird.     *will edit in a minute*     It's not only that, that makes animals special. It is also their ability to sense natural disasters. If we pay enough attention to them, they can save our lives.     I had two cats that warned me of someone breaking into my home, twice. They sensed him coming before he even made it to the window. In turn I made it to the window before him to and scared the crap out of him when we were face to face.    Also, when I was a teen, I was incredibly sad and I was sitting out on the back deck and this blue hummingbird came right up to my face, suspended in air and just looked at me. He did it three times. When he left, I felt better.    Later on that year, I found a website that said that the hummingbird is my b-day animal and that I am supposed to learn how to be more joyous from them.    Animals are like people in the way that we all have our strengths. Some of us are great artists and other people can look towards us for inspiration and technique. It's the same for animals. You can align with their strengths. Their inherent nature can also guide you through certain parts of your life.|`|C5i0kmtJaa	Well they teach you in a spiritual manner so just because dogs do that here doesn't mean that's what they teach you.

Dogs, for example...you've obviously never had one. They are loyal friends, they love you unconditionally. Doesn't matter how you treat them, they still will love you. They teach us to play, to take naps when we need it. I see quite a lot of things quite a lot of people in this world can learn from the simple common dog.     Birds, for another example... those little brown birds that are so common. Ever stop and watch them? They fly in flocks, live in trees in flocks. I passed a group today that was chattering up a happy little storm. Community. Love they neighbor.     see beyond the obvious. Lift your head and look outside the box and you'll answer this question yourself.    EDIT: I meant no disrespect in what I said, and I apologize if it came out as such.

It felt like she was warning me so I wouldn't step into them. She would always show me where things were she wanted me to see...not just puddles. She'd wait by it until I came and looked. Now I've noticed my other dogs doing the same thing a lot. They knew Sweetie too...but had never done it when she was here. She'd also run ahead of me to turn on the outside lights with sensors. She'd stop in front of them.  I'm just saying.... there's a lot more to them than just eating. I've never noticed them rolling in manure and haven't been able to get them to chase balls.

Let me tell you about them and what they do....lol.|`|iUM1h6Yjaa	It may just be the representation a person chooses for his/her conscience (the inner voice we all have for introspection, nothing supernatural) when said person mistakes this inner voice as some external spiritual agent.  It's really just a symbolic thing whether realized or not (dogs are loyal but wary, owls are wise and aloof, etc) and probably represents how the person feels about themselves, or perhaps what kind of person they want to become or maybe even afraid of being.    It's funny how this fad belief has recently taken off. Like all religious beliefs, it has its devout believers that can't be shaken. I think one of the reasons for its popularity is its customizability to the individual, whereas most religions are the same for all.  A person can choose an individual animal of any kind for their own reasons, making the whole belief more personal to them. I think a mystic minded person might latch on to that more readily than an organized religion.|`|os8S3wN7aa	I have never much looked into animal spirit guides but have done lots of work with spirit guides and spiritual things of that sort.     From my own experience my Animal guide is a sparrow, I know this because many times when something bad is happening around me or is going to happen a sparrow will usually fly down close to me and start chirping crazy.     One instance I was outside in a thunderstorm and the sparrow would get very close to me and would not stop chirping until i went inside, I came out 30 minutes later and it flew down again and started chirping.     Thats only 1 of many experiences, but I believe they guard us in a sense, they each help when needed even if its something simple like my guide warning me for minor things.     I do believe they have a spiritual purpose and you can meet them in meditation where you could talk to them or at least interact a bit.     Thats just my opinion from my experience.

AA10348639	Northeast    The month of January will be a bit warmer than normal. The average temperature should hover around 23 degrees, which is 3 degrees above normal. Precipitation is forecasted at 3.    The slightly above average temperature in the Northeast will lead to reduced snowfall for the region. The beginning of the month will see some snow through the 3rd of the month, as well as between the 6th and the 9th. Towards the end of the month Farmers is predicting snow showers around the 25th that will continue off and on through the end of the month.    February will also bring warmer than average temperatures to the region and precipitation 1 below average. For the most part the weather will be very mild with snowfall between the 6th and 10th. Mild rain showers are expected around the 13th. The rest of February will see warm and sunny weather with some snowfall around the 27th.    Unlike February, March is forecasted to be colder than average in the region. The average temperature is predicted to be 29.5 degrees, 3.5 degrees below average with above average precipitation (3.5). The beginning of the month will see a solid snowstorm lasting until the 5th or 6th. The 7th-12th will see snow showers followed by sunny weather. The snow will switch to rain around the 18th  22nd, with more rain towards the end of the month.
zYQFpJWNaa	I may not understand you r question completely. But if you are using three phase wiring, yes,the neutral wire may carry as much as the full current load of any single circuit - for any single phase of the three, never more. As the phases are closer and closer in balance, the neutral wire carries less and less current.    If you are simply branching a single phase, then the neutral wire will need to be able to carry the full current load for each segment, but to be correct, each segment would have to be individually fused.
OXsRXLx1aa	These aren't "simple" periodic table questions but I'll go ahead and give them a shot, for your sake...    1) The most stable isotopes of each mineral are used for the atomic weights. It just happens that it's Nickel 59 and Cobalt 59  59Ni with a half-life of 76,000 years and 59Co is completely stable    2) They are only slightly above the nominal (stable) value so they'd probably be less likely to break apart under their own nuclear forces.    3)  The upper half of the table contains the natural elements. We need almost all of these elements in large quantities for everyday life and tools. It only makes sense that we need a large amount of the most important elements and only trace amounts of the ones not quite so vital.

wDMWkYUcaa	Draw the the swimmer's velocity vector relative to the water. It should look like an arrow pointing North-East (or West). Then from the head of the arrow, draw the current's velocity relative to the ground point West (or East). Assuming you swim directly across (otherwise, more information is needed), you should be able to connect the two arrows that you've drawn to form a right-angled triangle.    The swimmer's velocity with respect to the current is the hypontenuse, the current's velocity with respect to the ground is the base and the swimmer's velocity with respect to the ground is the height.    cos28 = v/15, where v is the current's velocity  v = 1.5cos28  v = 1.3 m/s|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Set upstream as directly up the Y axis and cross stream as directly on the X axis.  Then your Y component is vy = V cos(theta) and your X component is vx = V sin(theta) where theta = 28 deg measured from the Y axis.  V = 1.5 mps wrt water.    To go directly across the vy velocity must exactly cancel out the stream flow downstream vd.  That is, vd - vy = 0 or vd = vy = V cos(theta) = 1.5*cos(28) = ?, you can do the math.

wfhZ5JuEaa	Rice contains a large amount of starch, which is a polymeric molecule constructed from many repeat units of the sugar glucose.    There are two forms of molecules in starch, Amylose, and Amylopectin.  Amylose is constructed of around 1,000 glucose units, and is linear (ie, connected in a row).  Amylopectin is constructed of around 5,000 to 20,000 glucose units, and is highly branched.    Lets imagine that starch is analogous to another polymeric molecule, a plastic called polyethylene.  Pure polyethylene is a chain of carbon atoms (with hydrogens as side groups) strung linearly or branched.  It is one of the simplest plastics.    Amylose can be thought to act like high density polyethylene, HDPE, which is used to create milk jugs (and in extreme cases, fibers for bulletproof vests, similar to kevlar in properties but much different chemically).  This is because its linearity allows it to fold upon itself and form dense, ordered crystalline regions.    Amylopectin acts more like low density polyethylene, LDPE, which is used for garbage bags, and for some food packaging applications.  Both of these polymers contain branching, and so are big bushy molecules that cannot fold upon themselves well.  This means it tends to form unordered amorphous (without form) regions.    Plastics as materials act as good heat absorbers because there is a lot of room on the molecular level to absorb heat in the form of thermal motion.  There is room for the atoms to 'wiggle' and still be structurally sound (albeit 'softer' than they would be at lower temperatures).    Furthermore, it takes a lot of heat for a plastic molecule to 'wiggle' out of a crystalline state, which means highly ordered dense regions will allow the material to 'absorb' more heat.  Eventually enough heat is absorbed that the molecules 'wiggle' fervently enough to cease to be a solid, and the material melts.    So starch being a mixture of Amylose and Amylopectin, it forms crystalline regions amid a predominately amorphous structure.  In long grain rice, the ratio is about 22% Amylose.  With shorter grain rice, this can potentially decrease to about 15% Amylose.  These crystalline regions can absorb a lot of energy as they shake themselves looser, and the amorphous Amylopectin region can also suck up a lot of heat (part of which it transfers in to the crystalline regions) as it 'wiggles' around.    So, in the case of making rice heating bags, uncooked long grain milled rice is recommended, because it has a higher proportion of starch (milling removes the outer layer, leaving proportionally more of the starchy interior), that starch is densely packed (cooking results in a 'gel' of sorts as the water infiltrates the starch), and the starch has a higher Amylose content than shorter grained rice.    Basically, rice has a high thermal capacity because it acts like semi-crystalline plastic, which is also an excellent heat absorber.    There may be some additional effects due to the cellular structure of the rice, but I don't know enough about cellular biology in plant seed structures to say anything about that...

9lzNDwhZaa	Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is the principal ore of copper.    Pneumatolytic veins containing chalcopyrite occur in Cornwall, Norway, Oregon, South Australia and Chile. An important mode of occurence is as hydrothermal or metasomatic veins as in California, Montana, Arizona, Alaska and Canada. Many of these are associated with Porphyry Copper deposits, especially those in Chile where gigantic open-pit mines such as Escondida and Chuquicamata can be found.    Pyrometasomatic deposits are important; in these the chalcopyrite occurs with other sulphides and skarn minerals at or near the contact between bodies of intrusives and limestone; examples are Clifton-Morenci, and Bisbee, Arizona; Bingham, Utah; Alaska, Canada, Australia, Japan and Korea.    Chalcopyrite associated with dominant bornite, occurs in the famous Kupferschiefer of Permian age in Germany and Poland, where the copper minerals occur as grains in shale and are of sedimentary origin being deposited at the same time as the shale. The Proterozoic Zambian - Democratic Republic of Congo Copperbelt has also been formed by similar sedimentary processes with chalcopyrite being the main ore mineral.    The Zambian - DRC Copperbelt probably contains the largest reserves of copper in the world. The mines that are currently being worked within this area carry some of the grades of any copper mines in the world (though cobalt is also recovered as a bi-product or co-product).|`|AA10348639	Chalcopyrite is the most important copper ore. Chalcopyrite ore occurs in a variety of ore types, from huge masses as at Timmins, Ontario, to irregular veins and disseminations associated with granitic to dioritic intrusives as in the porphyry copper deposits of Broken Hill, the American cordillera and the Andes.    Chalcopyrite is present in the supergiant Olympic Dam Cu-Au-U deposit in South Australia.    Chalcopyrite may also be found in coal seams associated with pyrite nodules, and as disseminations in carbonate sedimentary rocks.     Underground mining is used to find Chalcopyrite.  It is mined in England, Japan, Mexico, and the U.S.

gBSO0ty9aa	When the continents were forming, India was a separate island. Slowly, it moved towards the rest of Asia, finally crashing into it, pushing up the Himalayas. Also, it still is a rather large piece of land sticking out of Asia with a boundary in between in and Asia, and it is more like a giant peninsula which isn't really completely part of Asia because it attached on much later after Asia had already formed. Thus, it can only be partially considered as a part of Asia as it was on its own for a long time.|`|9d186c2ebefdbde8d0bb36cdaae05407aa	The Indian Subcontinent is considered as a subcontinent due to the theory of continental drift, this piece of land was a separate land mass when Pangea broke up into Gondwana and Laurasia.

mV1YscV7aa	The important thing to consider is what is written in the first chapter of the book of Genesis. The Bible is not a science book and we shouldn't read things into Genesis that are not there but, in the case of the creation of the earth and the stars, the Bible is explicit.    The earth was created on the first day (Gen 1:1).    Genesis 1:16 states, "Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also." This took place on the fourth day.    Creationists have very different opinions in terms of the earth's origins to evolution believing scientists. What evolutionists believe is based on supposition without evidence, what creationists believe is based on the Word of God which, by faith, we accept as true.|`|AA11513203	In so many of your posts you keep saying that you "know your sh**" ... but in post after post you reveal that you really, really don't undertand what the "evolutionists" think AT ALL!

So here you are asking the Creationists/Intelligent Design people what they "believe" about something "what the Evolutionists believe" ... when that's NOT what the "Evolutionists believe."    Furthermore, by combining evolution, elemental fusion, supernova, and creationism all in one sentence, you are munging together Biology, Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Religion into one confused question.    You really, really need to stop saying you "know your sh**" ... and just start *learning* about this stuff first.

Creationism (the young variety) teaches that God created everything all at once about 10,000 years ago.  Including all the elements.    The stellar-super nova theory to explain how elements formed is based on observable fact (stellar and solar spectra, the atomic structure of elements, experimentation in advanced physics, etc.).
1AZLDNZLaa	Would not the sum of their squares (not square-roots) be x^2 + y^2??  I will assume that is the case in which case the answer will not be 12,0 as you indicate. Either way you can use similiar reasoning if you actually do mean sum of square-roots and not squares.  What you need to do is to express the function you want to minimize in terms of a single variable.  Since you know that x + y = 12, you can substitute y = 12 - x in the other expression.  So we want to minimize x^2 + (12 - x)(12 - x) or  144 - 24x + 2x^2   taking the derivative we have 4x - 24.  Setting it to 0 and solving for x, gives x = 6, so y must = 6.

Amphetamine can be prescribed in 60mg; although it is a high non-lethal dosage (the fact that your heavier makes it even more non-threatening due to dosage varying on weight very often).    Overall - you'll probably be fine. Just monitor your condition. Call 911 if your confused, you have a huge tremor, are in panic, have hallucinations, bloddy urine, blackouts or excessive muscle twitches.

rSwce38saa	The feedback mechanism, also known as feedback inhibition, is a stimulator that halts/induces particular proteins/enzymes from doing their job.    Example:  If there is high levels of insulin in the blood, the brain would signal the pancreas to stop producing insulin.    Likewise, when someone gets a fever, their body is fighting off the infection. Once the infection has been isolated/removed, the body decreases its energy (or focus) on the specific intruder. The brain signals for the WBC and T-Cells to stop attacking if nothing is remaining, and stops the production of WBC.   That's why you don't always have a fever, after having a fever (if that made any sense)    Let me know if that doesn't make sense.

dmRiRUyyaa	For human (including you), you cannot have a ratio like in mendelian experiment with peas, with some reasons, including:  1. The age of human relatively is longer compared to peas.  2. The number of children is very limited.  The analysis of inheritance in human usually use pedigree analysis. In case of diseases (or other traits), the genes  would be analyzed whether they are inherited through:  a. autosomal dominant  b. autosomal recessive  c. lethal dominant/recessive  d. sex linked inheritance, or  e. non mendelian inheritance (mitochondrial, etc)
86zk0Lqkaa	1) Let A(5,y), B(1,4), and C(10,-3).

Let AB=20 and DC=2 be the two bases (vertices named counterclockwise). Then BC=DA=41.  Let H and K be the orthogonal projections of D and C, respectively, onto the line segment AB. In practice, the problem asks for the length DH.  Find the difference of the two bases, namely 20-2=18. Since HK=DC, we have AH+HK=18, so that AH = 9.  Use Pythagoras' Theorem on the triangle ADH to determine DH = 40.

jcGeCJnOaa	It's possible, but unlikely. There will certainly be objects discovered in the outer reaches of the solar system. But the third part of the IAU definition of a 'planet' states an object has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.     The outer solar system is a cluttered place. Not cluttered in the sense that things are bumping into each other, but cluttered in the sense that it's disorganized. Lots of objects in wildly eccentric orbits. In such an environment, it's improbable that anything will have cleared it's own orbit.     Of course the definition of a 'planet' may change. There always is a chance there might be an extremely large, dark object lurking way out in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, but it won't be the size of any of the gas giants if that is what your getting to.|`|v7Wflu78aa	There are many objects that orbit our sun.

Therefore in order to solve this equation you must raise each term to the to 10.    So you get....    10^(log(x^2-3x-18))/10^(log(x+3)^2)= 10^(log 4)    You can do this because you are raising both sides by the power of 10.    Here you must know your property of logs.   10^(log(x))=x    Also 2 log(x) = log(x^2)    So we now must simplify this expression    ((x+3)(x-6))/(x+3)^2=4    Cancel out (x+3)    So you get (x-6)/(x+3)=4    Multiply both sides by (x+3)    x-6=4(x+3)    x-6=4x+12    Combine like terms    3x=-18    x=-6        BUT WAIT......

These are the longest and shortest days of the year respectively in the Northern Hemisphere.    The equinoxes are the halfway point between these two.

AA10348639	You can see that the Sun's heat and light rays strike the EQUATOR, directly and not inclined at an angle. This is why it is so HOT in countries near the equator. At the North and South Poles, the rays from the Sun SKIM across the Earth at a very SMALL angle; hardly any heat hits the Earth in these regions and that is why the Arctic and Antarctic regions are so cold.     The N-S axis of the Earth is INCLINED at an angle of about 23 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun.     This means that there are a few months of the year when the North Pole is inclined towards the Sun (as in the diagram); the Sun shines down on the NORTHERN Earth for many hours of the day and it is SUMMER. Of course, the SOUTHERN Earth is facing away from the Sun and it is WINTER there.|`|IKxY8woIaa	Because the tilt of the earth on it's axis allows more heat to penetrate the atmosphere in equatorial regions.

To control the speed accurately you would need some sort of sensor that would measure how fast it is going.

Q2sZhNmJaa	Maybe a hat---When you take off your wool hat, it rubs against your hair. Electrons move from your hair to the hat. A static charge builds up and now each of the hairs has the same positive charge. Remember, things with the same charge repel each other. So the hairs try to get as far from each other as possible. The farthest they can get is by standing up and away from the others.     How to help/prevent getting shocked--    The simplest cure: before touching a doorknob, a car door, etc., first touch it with a metal car key. The fiercely hot spark will blast the tip of the metal key rather than blasting your sensitive fingertip, and it will painlessly discharge your body's charge. (Grip your keys firmly so no spark appears between the keys and your skin.) Once you've been discharged, you can safely grab the doorknob. However, if you walk around some more, or if you sit upon a plastic car seat, you'll again need to use the keys discharge yourself.     To prevent sparks entirely, we must somehow stop the charge separation process. This can be done by:    Changing your shoe soles to another type (try leather)   Raising the humidity in the room   Spraying carpets, floors, and chairs with an antistatic coating   Installing a balanced-polarity ionizer fan (  Wearing metal-coated shoe soles (try alum. foil, but it's slippery)   Wearing a grounded wire connected to a wrist strap
CFZvuB1Eaa	The difference between speed and velocity is that speed is just a value, and velocity has direction. (It is a vector).  So when talking about speed, you just say an object was going so many km/h, however when talking about velocity, in many cases it is necessary to give direction, such as "the object traveled 3 km/h in the x-direction and 2 km/h in the y-direction".    Instantaneous means "at a certain instance".  Still, instantaneous velocity can have a direction. It all depends on the direction of motion. It is also important to note that the derivative of a position function is a velocity function, and to find instantaneous velocity at a given time, t, you just plug t in.    Example:    Find the velocity at time t=6 seconds    x(t) = t^2 + 5t  x'(t) = v(t) = 2t + 5    plug in 6 for t and you get    2*6 + 5 = 17 m/s at time t=6.  It is just a value in this particular example because the position function is only in the x-direction|`|pInY6rYqaa	They are identical only if motion is in the same direction.

We were being told things which we never knew before and it was an amazing revelation, it inspired, excelled and drove us to the point that we could say that this just the beginning, and it is. With science we are still learning new things. Through it we have advanced beyond our natural limitations and have been set free even more.

sBYsjCaiaa	The Vikings are the ones who originally gave Greenland its name. In the summer, southern Greenland is actually quite grassy and green, and when it was first sighted by the Vikings in the late 900s, a warm spell called the Medieval Warm Period was going on, meaning there were likely even trees in southern Greenland.    There's also an alternate theory that claims that it wasn't meant to be named Greenland at all. In the language of the time, 'green-land' comes out as 'Gr?nland'. However, some sources referred to the island as 'Gruntland', or 'ground-land'. It's supposed that ground-land might refer to the many shallow bays and fjords of Greenland.

Since we're interested in when the stone will hit the ground we'll place the origin at the bottom of the cliff. Since the stone is thrown vertically we only need to track it in the y-direction. Here are our givens:     y0 = 75 m  y = 0 m  v0 = 12 m/s  a = -9.8 m/s^2     Now we can plug them into the equation:     y = y0 + v0*t + 1/2*a*t^2     0 = 75 + 12t -4.9t^2     Solving this quadratic equation for t we get 5.32 seconds for part A.     Now for part b we will use this value for t along with our original given values. Final velocity is given by the equation:      v = v0 + a*t  so:  v = 12 + (-9.8)(5.3)     v = -39.9 m/s     This value is negative because the stone is moving in the downward (negative y) direction.     For part C, we will need to know the stone's maximum height to determine it's total distance traveled. When it reaches its apex its velocity will be zero: so our value for v will now be zero. Since we don't care about time in this part we will use the equation without t:     v^2 = v0^2 + 2a(y-y0)    Substitute values:     0 = (12)^2 + 2(-9.8)(y - 75)     Solving for y we get 82.3 meters. So, the stone begins at 75 m, rises to 82.3 m, and then falls to 0 m. This is a total distance of 89.6 meters.     So:     A) 5.32 seconds  B) -39.9 m/s  C) 89.6 m

AA10332086	Yes, the amount of vapor and liquid load determines the diameter needed. In very small columns there is very little money to be saved so the whole column is the same diameter but very large columns there is significant money to be saved in reducing the upper section.     Usually the biggest vapor/liquid load in on the bottom trays and that typically sets the lower diameter.    There are other cases where there are side drawoffs that change the liquid/vapor load.

Many pumps have to be positioned as low as possible in order for them to use the weight of the fluid above them to stuff the inlet with sufficient flow to keep up with the pump rate*(search pump NPSH).  Many pumps are lowered into a pit or well containing the pumped liquid and it is more practical to have the motor above the surface of the liquid.    There are some designs that are made to operate while partly filled or even dry rotors, and these vibrate less and pump better if the rotor spins around a vertical shaft.

Like Mercury(II) Chloride, it is extremely toxic. Mercury(II) Bromide is used as a reagent in the KoenigsKnorr reaction, which forms glycoside linkages on carbohydrates.  It is also used to test for the presence of Arsenic, as recommended by the Pharmacopoeia. The Arsenic in the sample is first converted to Arsine gas by treatment with Hydrogen. Arsine reacts with Mercury(II) Bromide.     Example: [AsH3 + HgBr2]  [As(HgBr3) + HBr]     The white Mercury(II) Bromide will turn yellow, brown, or black if Arsenic is present in the sample.

Places a molecular biologist might work include research labs at a universities, biotechs, or pharmaceutical companies.  Mol biologists also do forensic DNA analysis at crime labs. They can also work at the patent office analyzing patent applications, or at regulatory agencies like the FDA.    A bachelors or masters can be sufficient if one is mainly interested in being a technician or bench scientist, performing experiments under the direction of a more senior scientist. If one wants to be a research professor or lab director at a research company, a PhD is almost always required.    P.S. If you're asking because you think you might want to be a molecular biologist, one piece of advice: while in college, make absolutely sure you spend time working in a real research lab. Preferably as part of a summer or part-time job, but an independent research study project is OK, too. The main thing is to get some experience with 'real' lab work. Doing canned experiments as part of a lab course is not a good substitute, and doesn't give you a good idea of what day-to-day research is really like.

Some of the hoaxers use this misinformation to sell books, some to get viewers for their programs and, hence, sell advertising. Some of them may actually believe it.    Nothing is going to happen in 2012 any more than any other year. I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the Hysteria Channel. If you pay attention and listen carefully, you will hear all the "weasel words" like "may be", "could", etc. The entire program was done that way. Their "experts" didn't actually say that anything was going to happen. They didn't give any actual Bible verses to support their theory, and all the Nostradamus "quotes" weren't what he actually wrote. They were what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012. Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being promulgated to sell books.  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.   It is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice. The current cycle ends December 21, 2012. They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012. It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012. Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us. The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time. Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.   Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.  Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Nothing is going to happen to Earth in 2012.    This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the History Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else.

q61hcJSGaa	For the purpose of this discussion I will begin with the dendrites and assume that the impulse has already been generated by the brain or spinal cord (for reflexes). The electrical impulse makes it to the axon of the presynaptic neuron. Once the action potential has reached the terminal button of the axon it opens calcium voltage gated channels. This allows for an influx of calcium in to the terminal button. The calcium binds to a protein called calmodulin. the calcium/calmodulin complex then acts on proteins called fusion complexes that hold neurotransmitter containing vesicles to the cell wall of the presynaptic neuron. Once the fusion complexes are removed the vesicle fuses with the cell wall and the neurotransmitters are releases into the synaptic cleft. Once in the cleft the neurotransmitters bind to the receptor proteins. The receptor proteins are either nicotinic or muscuranic. I am going to assume the receptor is nicotinic because I don't want to explain the second messenger system too. If the receptor proteins are nicotinc then that means that the receptor protein is actually an ion channel. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor protein, the ion channel (which is the receptor protein) opens allowing for an influx of sodium ions or chloride ions depending on if the neurotransmitter generates an EPSP (excitatory post synaptic potential) or IPSP (inhibitory post synaptic potential). Sodium generates and EPSP and Chloride generates and IPSP. I'll continue with EPSPs so that the reaction can continue. The influx of sodium alters the resting potential of the postsynaptic cell. Once the membrane has depolarized to about +15mV (as opposed to the -70mV for the resting potential) potassium voltage gated channels open (these are transmembrane proteins too) allowing for potassium to exit the cell. Once potassium leaves the cell this repolarizes the cell. In the process of repolarization the potassium channels are slower to close than the sodium channels and cause the cell to hyperpolarize to about -90mV and then normalize to -70mV. During this process of altering the cellular potential the cell is in what is called a refractory phase where no other action potential (or EPSPs or IPSPs) can be conducted. This opening and closing of transmembrane ion channels continues through the dendrites and the soma (cell body of the neuron) to the axonal hillock. Once at the axonal hillock if the cummulation of EPSPs and IPSPs has reached about -56mV than the axonal hillock will fire an action potential down the length of the axon. This value of -56mV is called the threshold anything more negative than that will not have any effect on the cell (the impulse stops there). If the value of the electrical impulses (EPSPs and IPSPs) is great enough to reach this value than the axonal hillock generates an action potential. The action potential uses voltage gated ion channels just like the generation EPSPs and IPSPs in the soma and dendrites, so teh impulse is propagated the same as I previously mentioned down the length of the axon, until it reaches the first segment of myelination. Once the action potential has reached the myelin sheath, the surface of the axon does not need to conduct the action potential for that segment. The action potential continues along the axon until the myelin ends. Think of it as a short cut for the action potential. This process continues along the axon until it reaches the terminal button and the process begins all over again.     I hope that i explained it well enough. This is a very complicated process and cannot be adequately explained in words alone. Pictures are very helpful.

dmRiRUyyaa	For the first gene (Aa) the phenotypic ratio would be 1AA:2Aa:1aa or 1/4AA:1/2Aa:1/4aa; and for the second gene the ratio would be 3/4B-:1/4bb. The first gene is incompletely dominant and the second gene is completely dominant. If you combine the probality of the two genes, then just multiply them:  1/4AA x 3/4B- = 3/16 AAB-  1/4AA x 1/4bb = 1/16 AAbb  1/2Aa x 3/4B- = 3/8 AaB-  1/2Aa x 1/4bb = 1/8 Aabb  1/4aa x 3/4B- = 3/16 aaB-  1/4aa x 1/4bb = 1/16 aabb  So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:6:2:3:1
NvSDc8bJaa	Geophysicists tend to be more involved in the initial exploration phase. As far as i'm aware it largely involves interpreting data from seismic surveys, essentially trying to get a preliminary idea of what is there and whether it's worth further investigation. Petroleum geologists come in once an initial borehole has been drilled, examining cores taken from the well to try and work out what the rock actually is. They tend to determine whether or not the rocks are appropriate for a decent reservoir and whether it's worth continuing. Geophysicists would still be involved at this stage as it's pretty much impossible to get a completely clear picture from rock cores.     Petroleum geologists are also involved in the development of the field although this begins to go into the realms of petroleum engineering.     This said, the first two answerers probably know more about it than I do as I'm still a student. From the point of view of the courses, I do geology but we do have some shared courses with geophysics. Generally geophysics tends to be (perhaps unsurprisingly) a lot more focused on maths and appropriate computer programmes whereas geology will tend to involve more chemistry and mineralogy.|`|a86HbDIZaa	To be quite honest, I don't know all that much about geophysics as a career. But the geophysicists in the petroleum business spend their time interpreting and improving seismic profiles, which just isn't my cup of tea.    I'm a petroleum geologist of that particular "sub-species" called "wellsite geologist". That means I don't do (much) of the planning of the oil wells or the follow-up after they are finished; I merely go out to the rig and do my best to find out what we're drilling through, how much oil there is, and how to drill to get as much as possible.     I like my job because absolutely everything I have ever seen and done is relevant and can help me do my job even better. I get to see the rocks before anyone else, and am the first to see the oil. Also, I like the time off when I'm not on the rig - and the pay is good, too. And I can sit here answering questions in my working hours while waiting for the next sample to come up.    Drawbacks? I spend a couple of weeks at a time on the rig away from home. My decisions can make the difference between a useless well and one producing for billions, either way.

Gmvldblraa	" All activity requires the transfer of energy. Huge numbers of  investigations have shown us that in the course of energy transfers, the  total amount of energy remains constant. Energy is conserved . Always. Our investigation will demonstrate that in converting one form of energy to another, the total energy will remain constant. Should we finish with more energy than we started with we will be startled and initiate a new age of free energy.

The solution to a log is the exponent that the base needs to be raised to so that it equals whatever you're taking the log of.    So: 2 is the number that 10 (the base) needs to be raised to so that it equals 2x+3    This means we can write a new equation without that annoying log:  2x + 3  =  10^2     [10^2 = 100]  2x + 3  =  100   (Now to subtract 3 from both sides)  2x = 100 - 3 = 97  2x = 97   (Now to divide both sides by 2)  x = 97/2 = 48.5    I hope this helps!!

pQszqyTgaa	Actually no. For something to be alive, it has to:  -Reproduce  -Obtain and use energy  -Grow, develop, and die  -Respond to the environment    Viruses are not living things, they aren't even single-celled organisms. A virus is merely a little strand of DNA with a protein coating. Since they do have DNA and RNA, that makes them a step closer in being alive, but they cannot use their genetic material for their own good, they have to use another living cell. Since they are not cells, they can't divide like bacteria. They have to take over a cell, by means of going into the cytoplasm and making the inhibited cell create the viruses DNA, thus creating more of that virus.    So basically, the answer is no. They are not living. And to simplify all that above, they take over a cell, kind of like holding a hostage and making it do something.

During operation, the motor drives the eccentric shaft shell to turn around through ahorizontal axle and a pair of bevel gear. The axle of crushing cone swings with the force of eccentric shaft shell so that the surface of the crushing wall is close to the roll mortar wall from time to time. In this way, the ores and rocks will be pressed and crooked and crushed.

If you look at your watch, it is simply a mechanical machine ticking away or digitally showing you sequential numbers at a predetermined speed.    We "measure" our day by 1 rotation around the sun.  Does the sun "tell" us what time it is?  The Earth is simply rotating around the sun, there are no inherent time equivalents.      We could have arbitrarily said 3 rotations around the sun is a day.

"The earliest displays for personal computers were monochrome monitors that were used in word processors and text-based computer systems in the 1970s. In 1981, IBM introduced the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). This display system was capable of rendering four colors, and had a maximum resolution of 320 pixels horizontally by 200 pixels vertically. While CGA was all right for simple computer games such as solitaire and checkers, it did not offer sufficient image resolution for extended sessions of word processing, desktop publishing, or sophisticated graphics applications."

X0e6p9Ilaa	You should look for a compound with a cation that will form a solid precipitate with one anion, but not the other.      Both Ag2S and AgCl are insoluble  Both PbS and PbCl2 are insoluble    CaCl2 is soluble in water, but Ca2+ reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 and H2S gas.  Ca(OH)2 is somewhat soluble in water.    Aluminum ion will do essentially the same thing as calcium ion.    AlCl3 is soluble in water, but Al3+ will react with S2- to form a precipitate of Al(OH)3 and H2S gas.   Al(OH)3 is insoluble and will precipitate.      But there is one more catch.  H2S gas is somewhat soluble in water and it will dissociate to form H+ and HS-, and a small amount of S2-.  Therefore, sulfur won't actually be separated from chloride ion by any of these reagents.    ========= More reactions =========    I just thought of how to separate these.  Use the Pb2+ ion.  Lead (II) chloride and lead (II) sulfide are both insoluble at room temperature, but lead (II) chloride is soluble in hot water.  Place a test tube containing the mixture of lead compounds in a boiling water bath and stir.  The PbCl2 will go back into solution.   Centrifuge to drive the PbS to the bottom of the test tube and decant the liquid which contains Pb++ and Cl- ions into a second test tube.  Add more water to the test tube with PbS, stir and repeat to get all of the chloride ion.  This should give you insoluble PbS in one test tube and PbCl2 in a second test tube, thus separating Cl- and S2-.    ========= Follow up ==========    Goteam says, "You need to figure out which cation will react with Cl but not S2."    Don't worry about trying to find a cation that will give you an insoluble chloride but a soluble sulfide.  There won't be one.  Only Ag+, Pb2+ and Hg2^2+ produce insoluble chlorides and all three produce even more insoluble sulfides.|`|Wv2CXTpEaa	You need to consult a solubility chart before you become more familiar with solutions.

pzdLyDzLaa	Yeah, i think they are the predators :P but um, generally speaking, the polar bear is an apex predator. It has only man to fear. But the orca, or killer whale, has been know to kill and eat the bear if it catches it swimming in open water. The orca, too, is an apex predator, and it will kill and eat deer, elk or moose swimming between islands or land masses if it has the opportunity. These instances are rare, but are a recorded part of wildlife studies.|`|CJigVHLIaa	their only predator is man and polar bears are known to double back and track men that are hunting them|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Polar bear have only one predator on land, other polar bears.  At sea they be attacked by killer whales.  Polar bear cubs are occasionally killed by large male polar bears.  The only mode of defense a young polar bear has is running.  At sea, a swimming polar bear would have little defense against even a single killer whale.    Inuit kill and eat polar bear.  However, there is no defense against a .308 slug.  Polar bear have the advantage of color.  Their white coats allow them to blend in with the usual snow colored Arctic habitat.|`|HjVjSI6uaa	polar bears dont have any predators. up there there are only foxes, fish and seals.|`|AZKbJESUaa	There is one other predator that would attack a polar bear and that is the Killer whale. Because the Killer whale is much more at home in the ocean, being more agile and versitile A Killer whale could easily kill a Polar Bear. This isn't to say that  Polar bear is a poor swimmer, as they are actually very good swimmers, and there fur being designed to protect them in many ways, also protects them when swimming and water doesn't stick to the fur.      On land the only other predator would be another Polar bear,wolves or man. A Polar bear will attack another Polar bear either because it is a mother protecting a cub or cubs, or it is a male Polar bear killing cubs, it is still unclear why a male kills the cubs, it isn't the same reason a male lion would kill cubs to put the female in season, and because they arn't his.  The cubs pretty much have to depend on there mother protecting them from any attacking Polar bears, though she is always on guard so it's not like a Male Polar bear will sneak up on them.      Wolves will attack cubs. They could only successfully do this in number as they would need to split the mother from the cubs.     Obviously a Human is a threat using weapons to kill them. There is cases of Polar bears outsmarting humans and killing them.   One case I know of was a group of oil workers up north they wouldn't hunt the bears but they did torment them allot, scaring them off throwing stuff at them, basically pissing the bear off. One morning one of the men left the cabin they were staying in, what he didn't know was the big male polar bear him and his friends were pissing off the past few days was waiting for him under the steps of the cabin, as soon as he left the cabin and walked down the steps the Bear jumped out and killed him.|`|nKU4BDfaaa	Answer: They don't have predators, they're the dominate species (not including humans) in the artic area.

dmRiRUyyaa	The sex of human (and some other organisms) is determined by the presence or absence of Y chromosome, so XY as a male and XX as a female. The dominant effect of the Y chromosome will direct the primodial gonads to develop into testes.  Further study showed that the testis-determining factor (TDF) is the product of a gene called SRY (for sex-determining region Y) located in the short arm of Y chromosome. This gene is responsible for the deterimination of the sex in human.  Some XX males were found to carry this gene inserted into one of the X chromosome. Some XY females were found to miss this gene in their Y chromosome.   I do not speculate with you friend, because we have about 30,000 genes. One possibility is that she is an XY female without SRY in her chromosome Y.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Uses & cultural aspects  Although there are no recorded uses for this species, other Euryops species were used in the past and this species was quite likely used in the same way. Euryops species are rich in resin, which sometimes appears as blobs on the stems and twigs. This resin was greatly esteemed at one time, by both the Khoi and the colonists, for its alleged medicinal properties. It was used as a substitute gum, and to preserve leather, like boots and saddles.     Its attractive dense foliage and bright flowers and its free-flowering nature have made Euryops chrysanthemoides a popular pot plant in Europe , Japan and America as well as in its native land where it is sold in garden centres and supermarkets. The flowers do not close overnight or indoors and last well in posies and small arrangements.    Artemisia afra is one of the oldest and best known medicinal plants, and is still used effectively today in South Africa by people of all cultures. The list of uses covers a wide range of ailments from coughs, colds, fever, loss of appetite, colic, headache, earache, intestinal worms to malaria. Artemisia is used in many different ways and one of the most common practices is to insert fresh leaves into the nostrils to clear blocked nasal passages     Eriocephalus africanus  Wild rosemary has traditionally been used as a medicine for many ailments like coughs and colds, flatulence and colic, as a diuretic and a diaphoretic. A tea is usually made with 1 cup of boiling water and a sprig of wild rosemary.    Tarchonanthus camphoratus  The camphor bush is used for medicinal purposes. Problems such as blocked sinuses and headache can be healed by inhaling the smoke from the burning green leaves. Drinking boiled mixture of leaves and water can help to treat coughing, toothache, abdominal pain and bronchitis. Leaves can also be used for massaging body stiffness and also as a perfume. The cottonwool like seedheads were used to stuff cushions.

o5aHZ1Xdaa	you actually get psychological stress when you have to urinate due to the increasing, and often very uncomfortable, buildup of pressure in your bladder. As you may know, you body sends stimulating chemicals (hormones) through your body in an attempt to coarse you into releasing that pressure.    One you release that pressure, buy urinating, your body stops sending the chemical signals and the psychological stress subsides, giving you that euphoric feeling. This sensation is a wonderful example of how quickly your brain communicates with your body through signals.    It is also important to note that the social pressure of actually making it to the bathroom increases that stress exponentially, thats why you feel especially joyful when its a... close one.    happy peeing,    Shamar!|`|8cDd70dSaa	Because you're releasing the pressure and ridding your body of waste?|`|Q8fcepcZaa	ohh yeah, its so good that amazing feeling of pure relief|`|RvXwjC7Yaa	lol! u are funny, the proper scientific reason for why you feel good at the point were your pee's about to end is because the pressure in ur bladder immediately releases the stress harmones that constantly egg it, sometimes ur bladders so full it has to stretch to contain more fluids, and as your bladder enlarge's the pressure inside the bladder increases, once the urine is released, the pressure just vanishes which if you imagine, feeling so bad to take a wee, and then immediately having no urine in the bladder would feel a lot better.  hope this helps!

Keep in mind that the positive ion is listed first in the formula.    In the first compound, CrO42- ion has a -2 charge.  The Li+ ion has a +1 charge.  It will take two Li+ ions to balance the -2 charge on one CrO42- ion.  The formula becomes Li2CrO4.    In the second compound, CrO42- ion has a charge of -2, while Cr2+ ion has a charge of +2.  You only need one of each ion in your formula which is CrCrO4.    In the third compound, the negative ion CrO42- has a charge of -2, while the positive ion has a charge of +3.  We need to use two positive ions for a total positive charge of 2 x (+3) = +6, and three negative ions for a total negative charge of 3 x (-2) = -6.  The formula becomes Fe2(CrO4)3.|`|s4TPXClxaa	OK the principle is that the negative charges have to be the same as the positive charges to make the overall compound neutral.    Lets use SO4 2- as an example (subscript of 4 and 2- charge)    sodium is Na+ so we need two sodiums to cancel tke 2- charge. So the formula is Na2SO4    Mg2+  We only need one magnesium to cancel out the 2-. MgSO4    Al is 3+.

WVPYem5Vaa	For acid-base indicators, it has to do with pH. However, for redox reactions, or complexation titrations, others are required, naturally.    K2CrO4 is used in precipitation titrations, where silver nitrate is added. By the time the reaction is complete, the CrO4 will start to react with the silver, forming a red-brown colour. This has nothing to do with pH, just the presence of certain ions.    Starch reacts with iodine to form a dark blue complex. Once the iodine is removed from the system, the iodine is stripped away from the complex, causing it to revert to a colourless state. Indicators like these have to do with complex ion formation.    Hope that helps a bit!|`|s4TPXClxaa	It depends on the titration. If it is an acid/base titration then pH is the thing that matters.  However there are other types of titration. eg redox titrations.  Here you will need a different indicator for example one that detects when there is an excess of the substance you are titrating with.

s4TPXClxaa	The two main problems you have doing the standard method used in school (ie copper calorimeter containing water above a spirit burner) is that:  1. Alot of the heat escapes and heats up the lab and not the water  2. You don't get complete combustion (yellow flame, soot deposited on the bottom of the calorimter)    A bomb calorimeter removes these two problems by:  1. Having everything insulated. The heat cannot escape - it has to heat up the water  2. Having loads of oxygen so complete combustion is gauranteed    The bomb calorimeter will always give a much higher value (ie more negative) for the enthalpy change

UfuTsYoKaa	What exactly is the question?  Do you have any initial values for either of the circles?    Otherwise, the circles could be of any size, just 5 feet apart, with one of them having a circumference 1.25x of the other.    Is one circle inside the other?    Well, looking at one circle inside another with the larger have it's circumference 1.25x the smaller, then we need to create a formula for this remembering the circumference of a circle is 2*pi*R, soooo:    1.25(2*pi*(R-5)) = 2*pi*R    Solve for R  1.25(2*pi*R - 10*pi)  2.5*pi*R - 12.5*pi  12.5*pi = 2.5*pi*R - 2*pi*R  12.5*pi = .5*pi*R  R = 25    Big circle's radius is 25, small circle is 20.

They have   Smith 3 sons 4 daughters  Hunter 2 sons and 5 daughters    See, we already have matrix A  3 4  2 5  Note that indexes are i=[Smith, Hunter] and j=[boys, girls].    ***********************  In order to multiply we now have boys and girls in column, and something else in the row. Lets compose the row of toy cars, books,  and dolls.    So we say that each child has  boy: 2 cars 3 books 0 dolls  girl: 0 cars 3 books 8 dolls    I hope you see the second matrix B:  2 3 0  0 3 8    Indexes are i=[boys, girls] and j=[cars, books, dolls]  **************  Now lets ask a question:   how many cars books and dolls each family has?    Easy:  N_smith,cars = A_smith, boys * B_boys,cars +  A_smith, girls * B_girls,cars  etc...    You see that   N = AB is table which answers the question, namely:  Smith: 6 cars  21 books  32 dolls   Hunter: 4 cars 21 books 40 dolls    Note that middle index [boys, girls] diasppeared because we convoluted (collapsed) this index like this:   ??,boys * boys,   + ??,girls * girls,   -> ??,      *********  Now try simaliar approach to construct matrix C and figure out what is BC and what is ABC. Lets say that we know price of each toy and weight of each toy. That would matrix 3 rows (cars, books, dolls) and two columns (price and weight).

It can produce unpleasant side effects, mainly ataxia.  But the most important question here is NOT why didn't 30 melatonin kill you?

Then I'll guess it's the same effect that drives a radiometer (ref.), whose vanes rotate in the direction such that the black sides retreat from the radiant energy source and the light sides advance toward it. So the light side would tend to face the sun. (?)  The problem is that the radiometer functions best at an air pressure of about 3E-5 atm; denser air impedes the motion. So my guess may be wrong, although scale effects and the fact that the balloon is radially symmetric may help.|`|FqXaNtwMaa	i think the black face,since black surface acts as a good absorber of heat than any other colored surface.  i hope this helps you.

The wolves from the tundra have been there for thousands of years, therefore have special adaptations that allow them to live in cold weather.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Charles Lyell: Principles of Geology:         It's been called the most important scientific book ever. A stunning claim, but certainly Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, published in 1830, shook prevailing views of how Earth had been formed. His book was an attack on the common belief among geologists and other Christians that unique catastrophes or supernatural events -- such as Noah's flood -- shaped Earth's surface. According to this view, a once-tumultuous period of change had slowed to today's calmer, more leisurely pace.     Lyell argued that the formation of Earth's crust took place through countless small changes occurring over vast periods of time, all according to known natural laws. His "uniformitarian" proposal was that the forces molding the planet today have operated continuously throughout its history. He also wrongly assumed that these causes must have acted only with the same intensities now observed, which would rule out asteroid impacts and the like.     Darwin read Lyell's landmark text while on the Beagle, and was much inspired by it. His own experiences during the voyage backed up the geologist's theories about how the shifting crust of the Earth was one of these long-acting, gradual, planet-sculpting forces.
v4gyXwiAaa	Average acceleration = (velocity 2 - velocity 1) / time of travel    velocity 1 = 20 km/h * 1 h/3600 sec ~ 0.006 km/sec = 6 m/sec  velocity 2 = 230 km/h * 1 h/3600 sec ~ 0.064 km/sec = 64 m/sec    Hence average acceleration ~ 64 - 6 / 7.50 ~ 8 m/sec^2    Your problem must specify UNIFORM acceleration (otherwise we can't solve it!), then da/dt = 0 and integrating twice we get distance travelled = v_i t + 1/2 a t^2 --here v_i is the (initial) velocity 1. Subbing in we get    Distance travelled ~ 6 * 7.50 + 1/2 (8) (7.50)^2 = 270 m.
mHnd1FJTaa	1) The question can be answered, just not with A, B, or C - (D), in my opinion.  Look at how much material you have - 100 g - none of those numbers will give you anything smaller than 100 g for an answer!      I think you may have accidentally switched the answers and the questions - it looks like the answers you put for 2) actually belong to 1).  If that's the case, the answer for 1 is (B), 100 times (3/4)^x (to check: after three centures, you have 100 * .75 (which leaves you with 75 g) * .75 * .75 = 42.19 g.  100 times 0.4218 (which is 3/4^3) is the same thing.     By the same logic, the formula for B was "original amount" times "how much is left" ^ "amount of time passed"  - so then the answer for 2 should be 300 times 2 ^   of days, B), 300 times 2^ x.  You can check the same way as I checked for the first one - say three days passes.  300 x 2 = 600 x 2 = 1200 x 2 = 2400.  Using the formula, 300 times 2^3 = 300 times 8 = 2400.

JwPu0XbIaa	Isotropy basically means "the same in all directions".    The isotropy of space means it has the same properties, no matter what your orientation.  The speed of light is the same in all directions.  If it were not, then light might take longer to get from point A to point B than it did to do the reverse trip.    This would break the symmetry of space, and the idea that an experimenter will always deduce the same laws of physics, no matter where they are in the universe, and no matter what (irrotational) reference frame they are in.

Thus you will get a more accurate reading of the speed of light.|`|JwPu0XbIaa	A one-way speed of light would be an inherent anisotropy.  Space is only isotropic of the speed of light is the same in every direction.  Therefore, the speed of light gets a single value (3*10^8 m/s), which does not depend on orientation.    Thanks for playing, Mike N, but there is most definitely gravity in the vacuum of space.  How do you think the Earth orbits the Sun?

lXgQ8hXcaa	A tsunami (pronounced /(t)su??n?mi/) is a series of waves created when a body of water, such as an ocean, is rapidly displaced. Earthquakes, mass movements above or below water, some volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions, landslides, underwater earthquakes, large asteroid impacts and detonation of nuclear weapons at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Due to the immense volumes of water and energy involved, the effects of tsunami can be devastating. Since meteorites are small, they will not generate tsunami.    The Greek historian Thucydides was the first to relate tsunami to submarine quakes,[1] [2] but understanding of the nature of tsunami remained slim until the 20th century and is the subject of ongoing research.    Many early geological, geographic, oceanographic etc., texts refer to "Seismic sea waves"these are now referred to as "tsunami(s)".    Some meteorological storm conditionsdeep depressions causing cyclones, hurricanescan generate a storm surge which can be several metres above normal tide levels. This is due to the low atmospheric pressure within the centre of the depression. As these storm surges come ashore the surge can resemble a tsunami, inundating vast areas of land. These are not tsunami. Such a storm surge inundated Burma (Myanmar) in May 2008.

[a. Jap. tsunami, tunami, f. tsu harbour + nami waves.Oxford English Dictionary]. For the plural, one can either follow ordinary English practice and add an s, or use an invariable plural as in Japanese. Tsunami are common throughout Japanese history; approximately 195 events in Japan have been recorded.    Tsunami are sometimes referred to as tidal waves, a term that has fallen out of favor, especially in the scientific community, in recent years because tsunami actually have nothing to do with tides. The once popular term derives from their most common appearance, which is that of an extraordinarily high incoming tide. Tsunami and tides both produce waves of water that move inland, but in the case of tsunami the inland movement of water is much greater and lasts for a longer period, giving the impression of an incredibly high tide. Although the meanings of "tidal" include "resembling"[3] or "having the form or character of"[4] the tides, and the term tsunami is no more accurate because tsumanis are not limited to harbours, use of the term tidal wave is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers.    The only other language than Japanese that has a word for this disastrous wave is Tamil language[dubious  discuss] and the word is "Aazhi Peralai". South Eastern coasts of India have experienced these waves some 700 years before and was a regular event by that time as per the stone carvings (scriptures in stone) read.    Acehnese language word for tsunami is i? beuna or al?n bulu?k [5](depend on dialect). Whereas Defayan language of Simeulue word for tsunami is semong. Sigulai language of Simeulue also has word for tsunami is emong [6].    Causes:    A tsunami can be generated when converging or destructive plate boundaries abruptly move and vertically displace the overlying water. It is very unlikely that they can form at divergent (constructive) or conservative plate boundaries. This is because constructive or conservative boundaries do not generally disturb the vertical displacement of the water column. Subduction zone related earthquakes generate the majority of all tsunamis.    A tsunami has a much smaller amplitude (wave height) offshore, and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometers long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell usually about 300 mm above the normal sea surface. A tsunami can occur at any state of the tide and even at low tide will still inundate coastal areas if the incoming waves surge high enough.    On April 1, 1946 a Magnitude 7.8 (Richter Scale) earthquake occurred near the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. It generated a tsunami which inundated Hilo on the island of Hawai'i with a 14 m high surge. The area where the earthquake occurred is where the Pacific Ocean floor is subducting (or being pushed downwards) under Alaska.    Examples of tsunami being generated at locations away from convergent boundaries include Storegga during the Neolithic era, Grand Banks 1929, Papua New Guinea 1998 (Tappin, 2001). In the case of the Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis an earthquake caused sediments to become unstable and subsequently fail. These slumped and as they flowed down slope a tsunami was generated.|`|f4vOFotzaa	tsunami is a wave formed when there is under water earth quake which send the shock waves higher than buildings it cause damage to life and property|`|5Zd7xa71aa	tsunami is caused due to earthquake in sea water.|`|1DcucGRRaa	tsunami = earthquake in sea

UFteXlqwaa	Wind bards follow the isobar lines. But that is only if you plot them at a certain altitude. Often the altitude at which one reads 500 hPa is used.    Closer to the ground, the wind bards turn toward the center of a low pressure due to the drag of the ground. How much it does that is very much depending on the nature of the ground and it can only be done by terrain mapping in computers, or by local knowledge. But it is evident that e.g. a mountainous region will offer more drag than e.g. an open ocean.
AA11513203	What you're describing sounds like theistic evolution.    Theistic evolution is the idea that God started life, and started the process of evolution, but then allowed evolution to unfold.  This also allows that God may or may not have intervened at time in that evolution, but for the most part, the biological process of evolution runs because God started it to do so.    It is similar to the idea that God allows new humans to be born through the biological process of human reproduction and childbirth. God may or may not intervene or contribute to this process in the form of contributing the soul to the newborn ... although some Christian faiths believe that God does not interfere, and that the soul is inherited all the way from the first soul granted to Adam.    Young-Earth Creationism is the most extreme form of Creationism.   It holds that the Bible is absolutely, *literally* true, right down to the six 24-hour days described in Genesis, the story of the creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, and every detail of the Noah's Ark story.  This also includes rigid believe in the *literal* list of generations from Adam to Noah to Abraham to David to Jesus ... and that all of these add up to a mere 6,000 years since the formation of the earth.  (To put this in perspective next to the scientific age of the earth of 4.6 billion years old, believing the earth is only 6,000 years old, is equivalent to believing the earth is only 6 feet in diameter!    Old-Earth Creationism accepts the old age of the earth, but still rejects evolution and insists that every species was created in its current form by God.   The main thing they try to fix is the timeline of Genesis ... and there are various approaches to this called 'Gap Creationism', 'Day-Age Creationism' and 'Progressive Creationism' (but I won't go into all those here).|`|8ssiOsDzaa	creationism|`|AA11103371	Creationism or Intelligent design.|`|qq5nceCXaa	Stupidity and ignorance.

It's used for transportationboth travel and shipping.     It provides a treasured source of recreation for humans.     It is mined for minerals (salt, sand, gravel, and some manganese, copper, nickel, iron, and cobalt can be found in the deep sea) and drilled for crude oil.    The ocean plays a critical role in removing carbon from the atmosphere and providing oxygen. It regulates Earth's climate.     The ocean is an increasingly important source of biomedical organisms with enormous potential for fighting disease. These are just a few examples of the importance of the ocean to life on land. Explore them in greater detail to understand why we must keep the ocean healthy for future generations.    Significant quantities of gold have been mined from ocean beach placers, and mid-oceanic ridges have yielded rich gold ore samples, but the greatest accessible reserve is the ocean itself.

Nostradamus didn't mention 2012.  Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012.  Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being promulgated to sell books.    There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.  They just recycle their old failed predictions for each new "doomsday".    This one is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.    Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist.  "Let me be very clear here: Nancy Lieder, Mark Hazlewood and the rest of these Planet X people (hereafter referred to as "PXPs") are completely wrong. No rogue giant planet is about to destroy the Earth, in May 2003 or otherwise."  from Phil Plait's Bad Astronomy, published before the predicted 2003 arrival of "Planet X".  Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The     Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.    Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.  Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|k5Ece8BTaa	The world isn't going to end in 12/12/12 it's the wrong date. The correct date of when the Mayan Calendar ends is 12/21/12 and this doesn't mean the world will end.     This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	My opinion is that we won't know for sure until that day comes.

The dogs my family have raised never had a problem with bitting, dominance, or peeing indoors at 7 months (we raised guide dog puppies).

T7zdRWHgaa	I think it wants you to find the equations of those lines. Or it wants you to find the intersection point. We'll solve for the lines first. You have to manipulate the equation to turn it into the form of y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the y - intercept. Thusly, through arithmetic, you get:  y = 5x + 9 for the first equation, and  y = -2x +2 for the second.    To find the intersection point, set the two equations equal to each other.  5x + 9 = -2x + 2    isolate the x on one side  5x + 2x = 2 - 9    solve for x  7x = -7  x = -1    To find the y intercept, plug x into one of the two equations and solve for y.  5(-1) - y = -9  -5 -y = -9  y = 4    So the interception points are (-1,4)  That's what I think it's asking you to do, but I'm not completely sure. At least you have something now. [=|`|vEhL5pwXaa	1. put them into standard form (y=mx+b)  2.plug them into your graphing calculator at the (y=) button at the top left.  3. hit graph  and look at the lines you will see where the two lines intersect. thats your answer|`|MbfFw03Yaa	that's a system of equations  it wants the value of x in which those two equations are the same or intersect if you're looking at their graphs|`|258c8918b8008933d8507500eed704dcaa	don't panic. It's quite simple.  graph both equations on the same graphing paper.  Their intersecting point is the solution.  That's all.  good luck|`|TdKfsALAaa	It means that you need to determine the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the point where the two lines intersect. These would be the values of x and y that would simultaneously make BOTH of the equations true.    You may solve the given system of equations  5x - y = -9  y + 2x = 2  either by the algebraic method or the graphical method.    Using the algebraic method:  Add Eqn1 to Eqn2 to eliminate y, then solve for x:  5x - y = -9  2x + y= 2  --------------  7x = -7  x = -7    Substitute to Eqn1, then solve for y:  5x - y = -9  5(-1) - y = -9  -5 - y = -9  -y = -9 + 5  -y = -4  y = 4    Solution: (x, y) = (-1, 4)    To check using Eqn1:   5x - y = -9  5(-1) - 4 = -9  -5 - 4 = -9  -9 = -9 Yes!    To check using Eqn2  y + 2x = 2  4 + 2(-1) = 2  4 - 2 = 2  2 = 2 Yes!    Now, if you look at the intersection point of the graphs of the lines 5x - y = -9 and y + 2x = 2, you will notice that the coordinates of this intersection point are (-1, 4) or x = -1 and y = 4. This is how the graphical method is used to solve a system of linear equations.|`|sTZxnQ7Naa	ill do the first for you but what you have to do is get y=mx+b and graph it  so 5x-y= -9           -5x      -5x                 what you do to one side do to the other          -y= -5x -9                  make sure y isnt negative and if it is then   ---------------               divide equation by - 1 minus becomes plus                 -1                          and negitive becomes positive    the equation is finally solved y=5x+9                    9 is the y coordinate so go to the graph and put a dot at 9 up  mx is the slope. slope= rise in this equation it is 5 so th top number is m so                           -------                  its  5 how many times up or down                           run                         ----                                                          1 how many times left/ right  if that numerator (rise) is positve you go up if negitive go down  if the denominator(run) is positve go right if negitive go left    i hope this helps.|`|l9WCI5Fuaa	so you convert/rewrite the equation so that it'd be y=mx+b and graph the equations, solve the lin system is prolly asking for the y-int and x-int, so solve for y?  oh, or come ehre: it will guide you:  http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help...

Another way to solve it is to simplify to one polynomial and then find the derivative.|`|OhhnWvjuaa	Ok first of all i think you made a mistake in copying this question.  I presume that you meant to write:    STEP1: F`(x) = (x^3 - 3x)(4x + 3) + (2x^2 + 3x + 5)(3x^2 - 3)    As what you have written is incorrect.    To differentiate this equation we use the product rule, as this function is the product of two smaller functions.    F'(x) = gh' + g'h    Where g and h are the two smaller functions in the equation and g' and h' are their derivitives respectively.    Therefore when you differentiate (2x^2 + 3x + 5) you get (4x + 3), and similarly the (3x^2 - 3) comes from differentiating the second function.    If you follow the rules and look carefully on paper i'm sure you will see where you are going wrong.
hlpdeiFuaa	the best method for detecting tsunamis is to precisley measure the pressure of the water at the bottom of the ocean. Envirtech has developed an instrument that uses a pressure depth sensor, and a computer with an acoustic modem to communicate this information to a surface buoy. The data are then relayed via Inmarsat-C satellite link to Land stations, which forward the signals for immediate dissemination to Warning Centers. Each deep sea station is designed to detect and report tsunamis on its own, without instructions from land. The tsunami detection algorithm in the instrument's software works by first estimating the amplitudes of the pressure fluctuations within the tsunami frequency band and then testing these amplitudes against a threshold value.The high accuracy of measurment is due to a quartz crystal resonator whose frequency of oscillation varies with the pressure.|`|w6wiWHlSaa	what are you talking about? a scientist or a instrument     So i think.. i answer your question both    the scientist study about tsunami and earthquake is Seismologist    the instrument they use are : seismograph , Richter scale and some recoding instruments.. thanks
74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	The average velocity of the first car going by is u = 8.6 m/3.70 sec, which is the initial velocity.  The average velocity of the second car is v = 8.6/1.8 mps.      The average velocities, taken at the center of each car, are v^2 = u^2 + 2aL; so that (v^2 - u^2)/2L = a = ? the average (constant) acceleration you are looking for, between the center points L = 8.60 m apart (discounting space between cars).  You can do the math.    The trick is recognizing u and v are average velocities measured at the mid points for each car.

This is pronounced as kilogram times meters per second squared. Mass(in kg) times acceleration (in meters per second squared equals Force, or weight, (in Newtons).  F=ma.  Also, you need to know that acceleration due to gravity on earth is 9.8 m/s^2.  1kg=1000g

9lzNDwhZaa	Men working in the mining industry, the oil industry and the construction industry have always had a TENDENCY (and it would be too sweeping a generalisation to say it is ubiquitous) towards a life involving vices.    These industries have always, until the last 10 - 15 years, been very male dominated in which wives, girlfriends have been left at home and men have gone off to some other part of the country or world to find their fortune.    It is an artificial life with people who often have different values to those generally found within society at large. As more women enter these professions and mining in B.C. in particular, the problem may slowly ameliorate.    A further point is that the Mining Industry in the past has not shown sufficient concern about social problems. Over the past few years, employment rotations have improved and the opportunities for wives and children to live at or near to mine sites have increased. The Mining Industry could probably do more along this line.|`|HyAFA5Jpaa	Life is dangerous - mining can be performed reasonably safely as can most enterprises which people think of as dangerous.  As for theft, drugs, prostitution, etc, those can be halted in their tracks with good law enforcement.
