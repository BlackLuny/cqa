wVsjgj35aa	It doesn't matter. They fled to avoid being caught in the middle of a combat situation. Probably both sides preferred to have as many civilians as possible out of potential war zones for the duration of hostilities. The Belgiums largely evacuated their country into Northern France prior to the U.S. invasion. The Germans made no attempt to discourage it. This is typical civilian behavior as war looms on the horizon; they hastily evacuate. It is entirely normal and it doesn't matter whether it was encouraged or by whom. The whole "issue" is simply used by Zionist historians to subtract attention from the real issue,which is the gross violation of international law and indeed all civilized norms in refusing to permit them to return to their homes at the conclusion of hostilities. Many Iraqis fled Iraq as the U.S. invasion became first imminent and then a fact. They have all been permitted to return. The U.S. -whatever it's crimes in Iraq - has not stooped so low as to prohibit their return and then bring over lower-income Americans to "settle" in former Iraqi homes with the intent of shifting the demography of Iraq from Iraqis to American expatriates. The whole mish-mash about who did or did not recommend short-term evacuation is simply a false "controversy" designed to obscure the real issue,which is: why were the Palestinians who evacuated from a potential war zone not permitted to return at the conclusion of hostilities? The answer is obvious: racism. You cannot convert a multi-ethnic society into a monocultural society without getting rid of all but one single "supreme" ethnic group to become the new Lords of the Land in an ethnocracy.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	i'm a palestinian refugee, part of my tribe is still in palestine holding israeli passport.<br>  i really don't care about all of this crap. that is our land, and we will kick these animals back to europe (if they are lucky)<br>  no peace is acceptable|`|lCW3Worpaa	Because it is convenient and (supposedly) supports the Zionist ethnic cleansing of the area.

The Arab states agreed upon this policy unanimously andthey must share in the solution of the problem." -- Emile Ghoury, secretary of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, in an interview with the Beirut Telegraph September 6, 1948. (same appeared in The London Telegraph, August 1948)"The most potent factor [in the flight of Palestinians] was the announcements made over the air bythe Arab-Palestinian Higher Executive, urging all Haifa Arabs to quit... It was clearly intimated thatArabs who remained in Haifa and accepted Jewish protection would be regarded as renegades." -- London Economist October 2, 1948"It must not be forgotten that the Arab Higher Committee encouraged the refugees' flight from theirhomes in Jaffa, Haifa, and Jerusalem." -- Near East Arabic Broadcasting Station, Cyprus, April 3, 1949"Every effort is being made by the Jews to persuade the Arab populace to stay and carry on withtheir normal lives, to get their shops and businesses open and to be assured that their lives andinterests will be safe." -- Haifa District HQ of the British Police, April 26, 1948, (quoted in Battleground by Samuel Katz)."The mass evacuation, prompted partly by fear, partly by order of Arab leaders, left the Arab quarterof Haifa a ghost city.... By withdrawing Arab workers their leaders hoped to paralyze Haifa." -- Time Magazine, May 3, 1948, page 25"The Arab civilians panicked and fled ignominiously. Villages were frequently abandoned before theywere threatened by the progress of war." -- General John Glubb "Pasha," The London Daily Mail, August 12, 1948"The Arabs of Haifa fled in spite of the fact that the Jewish authorities guaranteed their safety andrights as citizens of Israel."-- Monsignor George Hakim, Greek Catholic Bishop of Galilee, New York Herald Tribune, June 30, 1949Sir John Troutbeck, British Middle East Office in Cairo, noted in cables to superiors (1948-49) thatthe refugees (in Gaza) have no bitterness against Jews, but harbor intense hatred toward Egyptians:"They say 'we know who our enemies are (referring to the Egyptians)', declaring that their Arabbrethren persuaded them unnecessarily to leave their homes…I even heard it said that many of therefugees would give a welcome to the Israelis if they were to come in and take the district over.""The Arab states which had encouraged the Palestine Arabs to leave their homes temporarily inorder to be out of the way of the Arab invasion armies, have failed to keep their promise to helpthese refugees." -- The Jordanian daily newspaper Falastin, February 19, 1949.SOURCE: BIG LIES: Demolishing The Myths of the <br>  "The 15th May, 1948, arrived ...

Who brought themover in dire straits and penniless, after they lost their honor? The Arab states, and Lebanon amongstthem, did it." -- The Beirut Muslim weekly Kul-Shay, August 19, 1951"The Arab Exodus …was not caused by the actual battle, but by the exaggerated description spreadby the Arab leaders to incite them to fight the Jews. …For the flight and fall of the other villages it isour leaders who are responsible because of their dissemination of rumors exaggerating Jewishcrimes and describing them as atrocities in order to inflame the Arabs ... By spreading rumors ofJewish atrocities, killings of women and children etc., they instilled fear and terror in the hearts of theArabs in Palestine, until they fled leaving their homes and properties to the enemy." -- The Jordanian daily newspaper Al Urdun, April 9, 1953."The Arab governments told us: Get out so that we can get in. So we got out, but they did not get in."-- A refugee quoted in Al Difaa (Jordan) September 6, 1954In listing the reasons for the Arab failure in 1948, Khaled al-Azm (Syrian Prime Minister) notes that"Since 1948, it is we who have demanded the return of the refugees, while it is we who made themleave.

vfqaiqvfaa	From Winter Park, the closest beach is probably Cocoa Beach (which is maybe an hour away, depending on traffic), then a little further north is New Smyrna, and Daytona.  I usually go to New Smyrna (I live near Winter Park) However, the beaches on the east coast of Florida aren't very good for snorkeling/scuba diving because the water isn't very clear or calm.  There are lots of places you can go diving though within Florida's freshwater springs.  If that's not something you're interested in, you could make the 2 hour drive over to the Clearwater Beach area and really anywhere south of that on the west coast of Florida.  The waters of the Gulf are much more calm and clear.  Good luck!

They have great packages and rooms are much cheaper than some of the really nice hotels downtown, but just as nice. The rooms are a little small, but very nice.<br>  <br>  Hotel Lucia is DeLuxe's sister hotel, which is also nice. I don't think either have pools though.<br>  <br>  The Benson is also downtown and very nice. Beautiful lobby and bar area. Again, don't think they have a pool. Portland doesn't really have the weather for outdoor pools.<br>  <br>  The Jupiter hotel is on the east side of the city is kind a trendy/hip place if you're into that sort of thing. It's attached to a hipster restaurant and lounge that has live music almost every night. <br>  <br>  The McMenamin's properties are also a unique getaway and not too spendy. They are more rustic, but typically have soaking pools and nice spas. Kennedy School is on the east side of Portland and closest to the downtown area, but Edgefield is a winery and spa hotel about 15-20 minutes outside of Portland and very romantic.

English is normally studied at school, so you should have no problem.<br>  If you buy a good guide to Italy you'll find a chapter dedicated to the most important italian sentences to know.|`|pS4e5OtZaa	It is almost a given that shop keepers (in the cities anyway), those that sell things that tourists want, speak enough English to get around. If you do something unusual for a tourist - like get your hair cut - then you might have a language barrier. People who are employed (not shop keepers) like grocery clerks don't speak much English. But if you are buying leather in Florence or ceramics in Siena you aren't going to have a problem.<br>  <br>  Learn how to count in Italian.|`|o5N1phwFaa	I' am italian.<br>  we not speak english but I speack italian and ours dialets.<br>  The proprietors of hotels and bars speack english.|`|281df006d86d09e95b301dbed9c0459aaa	- in Rome, I was customarily addressed in English (I'm Italian and I don't think I look that "foreign")<br>  - in Venice, in the local dialect (which I luckily understand, since part of my family originates from a nearby city), but it's a very touristy city, so you shouldn't have any problems with English<br>  - in Reggio Emilia, Italian. It's small and not touristy city, so don't expect shopkeepers to know English, not even the basics.|`|fsAEEUUNaa	if you go to the main city you dont have a lot of difficulty...the clerks of central shop of city like Florence, Rome, Milan talk in english to Italians too!! That cities have the mania of being international and so they always talk in foreign language, english, french...you can find difficulty if you go to small town...people are ignorant, they can speak only their dialect there...there are a lot of distrust unfortunately...I live in a small town (fano, just for mention it) and I hate that racist and distrustful people...so, you can see, i am a little more brond-minded, i try to better my mind, i try to speak english...but...sorry for my language, i try to better my english too, i know...|`|fc07dd4e0ddbeae20f8e69ce27280ee3aa	Italians don't speak a good english usually, but unlike some other people (I won't say wich ones to be diplomatic lol), we do everything to understand people who don't speak our language, plus we have excellent not-verbal language skills, so you won't have problems. You could find some little problem just if you go in some small village far away from the typical tourist places.|`|lbiVX4U4aa	turists are welcomed in italy, people try to help as much as possible and in hotels and some shops they speak fairly good english. english is quite difficult for us, teachers insist on grammar but not on pronunciation and knowledge of words, so we know how to write a text but can't speak properly.|`|GE0RBuzSaa	Most people actually understand english so it's not too hard.|`|IvMPh09baa	its easy... I did it a few years ago and didn't speak a lick of Italian.  Just take the subway, in Rome the subway is free... I was in venice also and its full of tourist so you will run into a lot of Italians that speak english also.  You will be visiting very touristy cities, so you will not have a huge problem with the language because alot of the Italians speak a little english for the tourist sake....<br>  <br>  Only thing to watch out for is the pick-pocketers and theft... in these big cities the Italians know when you are a tourist and they will try to steal from you alot... it happened to me a few times, though they never stole anything I noticed them honing in on me though.|`|CDhn1NrKaa	We speak english but not everybody!

MVVQrEasaa	Well, "good but cheap"' usually don't go together, especially when talking about hotels in Seattle.<br>  <br>  You want to stay away from highway 99 (Aurora Avenue North) both for the noise and less than safe feeling atmosphere.  That's where you will usually find the "cheap" places near downtown.<br>  <br>  The Moore is run down but adequate, and definately cheap.  If you want to go Hostel style, the green tortoise is the only option downtown right now.<br>  <br>  There are lots of great hotels in town, but what kind of deals would be available in April and how much you would be willing to pay for them is very much a personal choice.<br>  <br>  One option to look into is the Wall Street Inn, in Belltown between Seattle Center and Pike Place Market. Their rates include a continental breakfast, and some rooms also have a kitchenette where you can save some by preparing light meals.|`|ci7AepVIaa	go to www.tripadvisor.com  and searcg seattle hotels and it will list all of them in order...that is how good they are.
YSzq7zUDaa	Pretty chilly. You can swim, but it's kind of cold... you get used to it though. I'd swim there and stay in the water all day, but my sister gets cold quickly, so it really depends on how much you can handle.|`|955cd4c5b601f9a08d8fd8e5ebbaf7ffaa	all i can say is it's COLD.<br>  dip your toes in, scream. walk away<br>  if your used to cold,<br>  grab a wetsuit.<br>  winter. not summer. <br>  good luck bro.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	About 55 to 60. Sure, they let you swim. They let you do all kinds of dumb things on Venice.|`|HXwNry0Laa	it is going to be slightly breezey coldish... they always let you swimm|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Water temperatures along the California coast range from the 50s in winter to the 60s in summer.  In March it's probably still below 60.  I'd suggest wearing a wetsuit if you plan to swim for more than a couple of minutes.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	The same as the rest of the year and yes you can swim in it.
a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	yes|`|MA5NqIuNaa	it's pretty cool.  the thing sways when your way up there.|`|AA12227902	Yes & no. Yes because it's an interesting view of the St Louis skyline; and yes if you catch the film in the theatre below the Arch BEFORE you take the tram to the top -- speaking of which, is also interesting. Scary sort of interesting. No, in that, the view is about all there is. That said, if you decide to go - I'd highly recommend going in the summer during baseball season or while the free concerts on the riverfront (just below the Arch grounds) are going on. Visit Laclede's Landing - lots of cool shops, restaurant/bars, & museums. If you're coming to St Louis for a visit anyway, I'd recommend a visit to the Arch ~ it's worth your time. :)|`|eXPBp6vZaa	yes! its awesome go there im going next month!!
yna24Nbuaa	La is not that bad. You just have to know the short cuts and know when to hop on/off the freeway.Most people who cry bloody murder about la traffic are those who can not nagivate their way through it. The smart driver knows the ins and out of the cities that freeways run through. Therefore it is no prob for them to see a traffic jam ahead and get off the freeway and drive the street the rest of the way.<br>  <br>  Only dummies stay in traffic lol.We true LA driver call them mq or (mapquest cases) .lol|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Avoid the 405 as MUCH as you can!|`|AA11149042	I would wait until 7 or 8 and let all the rush hour traffic die down.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	OK, here's the deal. Most of these people don't know what they are talking about. The key thing to remember is traffic PATTERNS. <br>  <br>  If you leave Thursday night, you are going to have really bad traffic all the way from Calabasas through at least Pomona or Colton. That's a gnarly drive. The bulk of the traffic will be OUTBOUND from downtown LA. However, the 101 between the 170 and 405 is almost always bad. <br>  <br>  So, I would say that you should get up early Friday morning, as early as you can without hurting yourself. The earlier, the better. If you can get on the road by 7, you'll avoid the worst. It will be bad as fare as Burbank, but then it should open wide around Glendale. Then put the petal to the metla, and take the 134-210 all the way to the 57 south (San Dimas), then jog over to the 10 east. Cabazon is a great place to stop and take a quick break, and grab a bit to eat. <br>  <br>  Happy driving!|`|wTIvLkJSaa	You are going to face horrible traffic if you leave anytime between 4:30 and 7:00.  If you leave IMMEDIATELY at 4:30, you might get away with only hitting traffic around 6:00.  The best time to leave would be around 8:00 pm (which will get you into Phoenix at around 1:00 am) or at 11 am the next day.  Know though that the traffic will be HORRIBLE on Friday no matter what time you leave.|`|N8wNmQShaa	LA's Triffic is mainly bad between 4:30 and 6:30 pm ... so anytime avoiding those would be good for you.<br>  <br>  It is also bad between 7:30 and 8:30 am.|`|EJJtCUKHaa	the worst time would be post apocalyptic <br>  <br>  so i guess pre-apocalyptic LA is best :)|`|FgTkF31iaa	DON'T wait till Friday. That is the worst Time. If you leave Calabasas on thursday at 4:30 take the 101 to the 405  north to the 118 East to the 210 Take the 210 to the 15 then back Down to the 10 East a bit longer but better for traffic  or wait and leave after 8 PM its about a 7 hour drive Good Luck|`|uBxHjEbEaa	Wait untill 4am friday morning.|`|Hk6wIgiOaa	Leave thursday and wait a few hours. Dont leave Friday traffic sucks all day mostly...|`|VqSvA2niaa	you got to drive around 12:00am to 3:00am that is the best time|`|zMlYwentaa	Leave after 8pm and before 2am.<br>  From my experience that is the best..|`|ccf5ba9811daa4da6cba93a751ab16faaa	Well, I can tell you that the worst time to drive through LA is between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59 p.m.  Yep.  The worst time to drive through L.A. is ANYTIME!
YwVqS4JHaa	The weather would have to be pretty clear to get an NYC station in New Hampshire.  I can tell you that one summer on Cape Cod, (Brewster), we did get WCBS 880 New York during a clear summer day as well as WFAN 660|`|URO3gDXcaa	nope.  too far away.|`|a4585b3149f7e883c37ad27477a76027aa	yes in the evening, 7pm on. Weather has to be fair. clear. I listen. Also in nh 1250 am Boston eei 650 am.
UOHpzGGhaa	You will not have to "check in" again, as somebody else wrongly claims. You already have your boarding pass in hand so why would you go check in again? <br>  <br>  You will have to go through all of the normal security and customs lines again though.<br>  <br>  Question for you though....why not just ask somebody there? It seems like a more logical and faster way to get this question answered, no?|`|1bd3a30fe0dded20441628c6b70e4daaaa	I've done that on international flights, you can leave and come back, you just have to show your passport again, and check in again. It's not a big deal, just don't do it close to your boarding time|`|eda1e3044f3b72caa810590b84628887aa	you can check out but you can never leave
D2GiPPjTaa	it depends on the insurance you all ready have... some of them like the "Collision damage Waiver"... it is for the excess? it depends on how much your excess is ect. if you crashed here would you be able to afford the 200€/$ excess ??<br>  <br>  Another thing is if you're from the U.S.A I don't know how it would work... I think you'd need to buy European Protection...<br>  <br>  because here... they market insurance with European Cover as standad for 90 days for example.. but some companies don't give you any, so if you're from the U.K or E.U you might all ready have some<br>  <br>  ;) Also if you tick the box before you rent the car and ask for things such as a roof rack, if you rent the cheapest car and they don't have a roof rack for that model you've asked for then they will upgrade the car for you =) so add everything that is free, and that you could put-up with if you did have to get it.... but for example a Micra... you won't get a roof rack but it's an option so you might get a SEAT Ibiza =)<br>  <br>  have a nice time|`|AA10751264	This is what I was told that the car rental companies, any of them, DO NOT tell you. <br>  When you rent a car and have your own insurance, yes, usually, that will cover you, you need to check on that tho for sure, because some will not if you are OUT of the country, the thing is, if you get in a wreck, the car rental company will charge you every day that car is out of commission getting fixed for what they can rent it to per another person. Get insurance!|`|5iK2s16Naa	autoinsurance.maclenet.com - try this one. I have their car insurance and, as I know, they can provide such a service.
RFK9sG6zaa	I believe if you pull-up "Map Quest" it shown all the info you'll need ?|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	MANteno(lives here) is roughly 361 south (cicero ave Rt 50) <br>  easest way is I-57 south once you get to I-80 it is roughly another 25 minute drive south<br>  Manteno is rougly 45 miles from your location<br>  and cypress street would be the first street once you make the left (stoplight) and go into town Cypress street is the first street
YPHaQ1asaa	It should take 5 to 10 days to get to you.  Business days don't count with mail.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	The Post Office promised that you will get your Package from 3 to seven days.  If you want to be sure and really faster, why don't you ship it by UPS, TNT, and those other air cargoes services that promised deliveries within your specified time?|`|nhYABprkaa	2 weeks to Canada, it will take Canada post another 5 days or so, Canada post drags its butt?  So maybe almost 3 weeks?<br>  <br>  2 weeks to the US is the same like shipping from China.<br>  The Chinese are very business like, if the guy is a Thai, then its on Thai time.|`|KXpxXPPFaa	Three weeks Airmail.

pTLcvsVfaa	"Operated by" means the actual plane you will be on.. in this case Air New Zealand.<br>  <br>  BMI is selling seats on the Air New ZeAland flight.

7oA361fbaa	I'm sorry but the only thing you could really get is the population of each town, you would then have to improvise a bit, like saying that a house has 3 occupants on average to work out a rough estimate, Eg: if Belfast's population is 267,500 then there would be 89,166 houses, again this is a very loose estimate and wouldn't take into account vacant properties.

(Haida, etc.. totem poles and all such).  <br>  <br>  Lighter stuff...   a few decent wax musuems and attraations along the inner harbour and lots of shops within walking distance of there. <br>  <br>  enjoy the city of the "newly wed and nearly dead" as we locals say  (actually not so bad)_
bxW3iX53aa	basically nothing is free. you can take loans out and what not, but eventually they have to be paid off. there might have been a way your friend got his school paid for him, depending on the situation SDSU will help, but i have never head of paying all of a persons education. 15-18 units is a lot so he possibly got good grades and enough grants to attend college for free|`|TNTFomKeaa	If you're on low income you should be eligible for financial aid which would pay your tuition for you at any school, not just at SDSU.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Sounds like he was getting grants. Pell grant and the Cal grant are the two you can get and you don't have to pay it back. However, last I heard on the news, they were cutting the amount they give out on the grants. Anyways, these grants are statewide, not just limited to San Diego.

Doesn't have that typical "complex" uptight feel to it, but the apartments were sketchy when I lived there, with lots of sketchy people, and I can only imagine how much worse they've gotten since then. That area is just going downhill sooooo fast. But, read up on it yourself and see what you think.

5G9WGH0Baa	I am prejudiced towards north Manchester after years of living in Crumpsall, Cheetham Hill and Broughton Park. I never had any trouble with crime and enjoyed the greenery, shops and local facilities.<br>  <br>  Prestwich/Sedgefield Park has some lovely streets, decent pubs, lots of trees, easy access to parkland and very good transport links (trams as well as the bus, whereas Didsbury/Chorlton depends on the buses only and the routes are extremely congested).<br>  <br>  The tram lines are improving, we'll have new ones soon but the fares do keep going up and up. At least in Prestwich you're guaranteed getting on one in the morning, they were always full by the time they rolled into Crumpsall.<br>  <br>  Prestwich village aspires to be a Didsbury of the north with wine bars, new flats, Italian restaurants, etc but still has proper pubs and lots of affordable shops to choose from.<br>  <br>  Housing stock is mixed, from old Victorian villas to tiny 1930s semis.<br>  <br>  The Jewish influence is strong in parts (lots of synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres) but most of the area is quite mixed.<br>  <br>  Can I just pre-empt whatever HaroldShipman/TonyWilson/CockneyD is going to pipe up and say in a cowardly fashion when there is only one hour left to answer (and therefore giving us no chance for rebuttal) by saying you should ignore our local troll?|`|2065d879020c577d272fe6db49208cdaaa	I was thinking the exact same thing! so firstly I am going to say thank you for posting your question! secondly, I have been told that Prestwich is the best place to live if you have a family, this person lives in Oldham so isn't biased or anything (I don't think lol).|`|NePxlTnZaa	I live in Bury so I'm immediately more familiar with Whitefield/Prestwich than Didsbury/Chorlton.<br>  <br>  Neither are particularly rough areas and have a lot of similarities.<br>  <br>  The southern suburbs do have the "snob" factor though and therefore housing prices to match.<br>  <br>  Apparently the Whitefield - Prestwich - Broughton Park area has the largest Jewish community in Britain outside of London. With the exception of the odd synagogue and kosher food shop it's not that noticable until you get right to the bottom end of Prestwich and into Salford/Broughton Park where there appears to be a larger number of orthodox jews who are a bit more distinctive.<br>  <br>  The Metrolink tram system is indeed very convenient and efficient for any travel into Manchester.<br>  <br>  Whitefield and Prestwich fall within the borough of Bury which has the lowest crime rate in the county of Greater Manchester. It's also the third most affluent borough after Trafford and Stockport.<br>  <br>  To be honest with you, you could toss a coin on it because they are both decent suburbs.|`|77ab32ec1902d28ee2a92c36db9406c6aa	I live in Didsbury and have to say that in my opinion Didsbury and chorlton are a little over priced, i would recommend somewhere like withington, it is only about 3 minutes away from west didsbury but you don't have to pay the price. <br>  <br>  Both the Northern and southern areas are both quite nice however they are both bordering slightly less nice areas. <br>  <br>  It really depends on where you are working. <br>  <br>  The tram line does run to the Northen areas but the bus services from Didsbury and Chorlton are really good and cheap and regular. <br>  <br>  I would say that Ddisbury/Chorlton/West Didsbury are slightyl younger areas, more aimed at young professionals. <br>  <br>  I really hope that helps<br>  <br>  Where i live is right round the corner from the police station, there is a strong prescence but no crime that I have seen or heard of.  however I used to live in salford and never experienced anything there either. <br>  <br>  To be honest with you from what other people have said I would be tempted to go with north manchester, didsbury and that way is very ex students and if you have families and stuff it might not be suitable, however there are lovely parks and walks and nice summer pubs.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll find somewhere you like.

GEUU9q2Paa	The Westin on Kaanapali Beach where you are currently booked has an older tower called the Ocean Tower, which has small rooms (380 square feet including the lanai) and there are no closets (only an armoire) in those rooms.  If you stay at that Westin, reserve a room in the newer tower, called the Beach Tower, where the rooms are not so small and they do have a closet in the room (456 square feet including the lanai).  Details about the Westin, with photos, are here:<br>  <a href="http://www.mauihawaii.org/hotels-condos/westin-maui.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mauihawaii.org/hotels-condos/...</a> <br>  <br>  The Sheraton on Kaanapali Beach is newer than either of the two towers of the Westin.  Room sizes are quite variable.  The Sheraton does not have as elaborate pools as the Westin.

But the Grand Wailea on the south side is Maui's most elaborate hotel, with amazing pools, so if that's what you want, then the Grand is the place.

It is relatively undeveloped & the hotels tend to be set back from the beach more with a lot of green space between hotels.  Kaanapali has more hotels with more of a mix from less to more expensive (nothing is cheap).  It is closer to Lahaina, if you want to eat at a restaurant that is not hotel based, or you want to do some shopping.|`|PVQXOmUAaa	DONT LISTEN TO THEM ALL THOSE PALCES ARE UGLY STAY IN HANA!|`|URZNtrxsaa	I have stayed over the years at both the Westin and the Sheraton on Kaanapali beach. The last two times we stayed on Maui, we stayed at the Grand Wailea Resort in Wailea and there is NO comparing the Westin and Sheraton to the GW. It is by far one of the best properties on the Island. I would cancel my reservations in a heartbeat and move south to the GW in Wailea!!! You will never regret it!<br>  <br>  Mahalo|`|QJy1byOmaa	It depends on what you are looking for, Lahaina is def. the more touristy side of the island. Wailea is more expensive. There is a lot more night life and things to do at night in Lahaina, plus it almost never rains over there.

Q6WuWyh3aa	You can't judge a whole population by the actions of one person. Like many places PR has safe and unsafe zones; and good and noble people and the regular nut job. Before thinking like that ask yourself: How many pregnant women have unfortunately been  murder here (where you live)?|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	White pregnant women are killed every day in the mainland U.S.   Do you really think it is reasonable to expect there would never be a murder in Puerto Rico?  In 2006, there were 1836 women murdered by men in the U.S.  That is about  35 women every week.  There were most likely several killed in the city where you live.  As someone else said, it happens everywhere.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	PR has crime like everywhere else.  This tragic event got large news coverage because the victim was a tourist and because she was pregnant.  If she was someone from PR probably you did never knew about the crime and you would feel as safer as before.|`|zCjzu5claa	you mean the british woman who was married to a puerto rican and she was pregnant and they went for vacation to PR. she was in a bad area at the bad time (very early in the morning) all alone and to confident and without knowledge that the world is a dangerous place no matter were you go. I live in FL and my mom and son in PR and she was the one who told me about this news. there have been cases before were people get killed walking around in parks too early or late at night with no dogs to be guard or anyone else and not only did the white lady was killed but lots of woman have been killed if you go all alone in a bad neighborhood, it happens all the time in Orlando Florida, kids get raped, woman get raped and killed very often were I live and its even more scarier than PR. I feel sorry for what happend to that lady. I think she was raped and killed and she was pregnant and I hope their is justice to serve to whoever did wrong to her and any other woman or children. You shouldn't be afraid of crimes that happen every second everywhere you go or any place you visit. You just need to stick to places and people you are very informed and aware of, thats all you need to know. Im sure she wasnt killed because she looked white, for many puerto ricans can look white physically as well as black or biracial, we are a mixture of everything. she got killed because life was not fair to her and she was a woman all alone in a bad neighborhood in a very bad timing.|`|5CRXkxksaa	Unfortunate events happen everywhere and I guess that incident is not a common one.

vhlORK4Waa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I have been going annually to Lanzarote since 1981 and have seen it go from a quiet island to something rather different. Playa Blanca is still the nice part of the island, and although developed now, is still nice.<br>  <br>  Beaches - what I call the "town" beach in PB (Playa Blanca) is nice, it is golden sand, there are two man made beaches Playa Dorada and Playa Flamingo as well = these are protected by breakwaters and I don't think they're as nice.<br>  <br>  September is THE best time to go - the summer can be very windy, but September it is normally in the late twenties / early thirties, and warm right on into the evenings.<br>  <br>  Oh I don't know whether I should tell you all MY favourite places or let you discover your own.....I hope you are hiring a car, because that is THE only way to see the island. The volcanic landscape is amazing, and is in September at its most barren - you can hardly believe in spring that it is green (not green like the UK, but definitely green!!) It also differs from north to south, the south, where PB is, having had the most recent eruption in the 1750s.  there are something like 38 villages beneath the lava flow that you will see - and this area is now a National Park.<br>  <br>  OK - there is a nice walk along the front at PB from the beaches at Papagayo which people rave about, but I think are somewhat overrated (and you have to pay to go to them)<br>  <br>  Climb the MOntana Roja - youll have to drive half way and then you can park and walk the rest.<br>  <br>  There is a lovely marina in PB, and a couple of nice restaurants - Lani's is one - it's part of a chain, but they're all subtley different, and this one is ok.<br>  <br>  On the front at PB, steer clear of Pedro's - he is purely after your money and the service is dreadful.   Brisa Marina is steadily good....not amazing, but consistently good.  Of the others, well each to their own.<br>  <br>  Walk out by Pechiguera, the lighthouse and look at the views across to Fuerteventura.....sigh....<br>  <br>  There is a black beach at Janubio which I personally love, but it;s not everyone's cup of tea, not a swmming beach, its a playing in the sometimes amazing surf! Los Hervideros are worth a visit on a blustery day, and then carry on round to El Golfo and have lunch or if you like fresh (but expensive) fish, go in the evening. El Caleton, the restaurant right at the far end of the road, jsut before it peters out is good. <br>   Go over to Famara for some real surf. Again it is not a swimming beachm and watch out for the current, there is a rip that can be very dangerous - do not go out too deep....you will see what I mean.<br>  <br>  I would suggest if you have a car that you go up to Teguise, the old capital, but not on Sundays, the market day, it;s awful and a rip off for coach parties. Try another day, and wander round the cobbled streets, it is a very old Lanzarotian town. Get off the beaten track where you can - follow roads and see where they lead. Watch out for going off road though, some of the tracks are not what they seem and you can end up in trouble (bitter experience!!)<br>  <br>  If you must go to Puerto del Carmen the Old Harbour is best for decent restaurants, though what is called "the strip" across from the beach promenade has lots of restaurants of varying quality.<br>  Avoid Costa Teguise like the plague, it is totally man made, and it is awful - sorry folks if you like it, but I remember when it was a strip of coast with two fishing boats and a cottage.<br>  <br>  Arieta has a couple of  nice restaurants two of which are hugely popular with the locals, avoid the one at the far end of the main street near the harbour, it's known as the "black hole"........the restaurant on the harbour itself is ok too, but you have to find your own faves!   Up the north end of the Island, look for El Caleton Blanca - a volcanic reef enclosed lagoon - which rises and falls with the tide.<br>  <br>  If this is your first time then you must go to Los Cuevas de los Verdes and Jameos del Agua, Mirador del Rio, and Guinate Wildlidfe Park. The first two are opposite one another on the north road......<br>  <br>  If you drive back via Haria, be careful of the road, there are some vertical drops which are a bit nerve wracking.<br>  <br>  Make sure you visit La Geria, the wine growing area, and stop in at El Grifo, the oldest wine producer on the island. In fact whilst on the island, try lots of different wines, quite often the house wine is worth having, and is usually different night to night.....yum yum.<br>  <br>  In Yaiza, the ayuntamiento capital (administrative capital) just north of PB, there is a good restuarant in an old finca - I can't remember the name, sorry...<br>  <br>  and of course the Montanas del Fuego - and Timanfaya - again as this is your first time, take the car up to the car park - the drive across the lava field from the roundabout at Yaiza is amazing, and keep going past the camel rides, round to the entrance to the Fire Mountains, you have to park up and get on a coach......you can even have  lunch up there, cooked over volcanic fire.....expensive though. As you come out if you turn left you will come to the Volcanic Museum which I love purely for the walkways that take you out into the middle of the lava field (which otherwise you can't enter - protected area) and the silence - apart from chattering tourists who soon leave - the silence is bliss.<br>  <br>  No there is no truth in Lanzagrotty - I hate that phrase - yes there are awful over developed tourist areas, but if you take your car, and just drive, and take turnings and see what;s whatm you will discover the island for yourself. <br>  <br>  Don't stick just to the main roads or you will miss so much.<br>  <br>  I envy you, as this is the first year in 28 years I shall not be going, remember me to PB!!   I stay in a little village called Las Brenas, on a volcanic shelf really, up above PB. In Brisa Marina there is a picture above table 4 showing PB prior to any tourist development, see if you can have a look. The first things to be built were Las Casitas, Las Brisas, Los Calamares and the little complex next to them. That was it for years - what you see now has pretty much all been built in the last 15 years....Beyond the harbour towards Pechiguera was nothing, absolutely nothing, and the town stopped at the end of the curve of the town beach bay, there was nothing. Now it stretches all the way to Papagayo effectively...lord I am getting old!!    I wish I were there now.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a lovely time, email me if you want to know more - I have written about the things I love about the island, but some people seem to have entirely different holidays ful of drinking and clubbing and 12 hours asleep on the beach - that's not me, and there is so much to LZ that that is a waste.<br>  Halcon|`|aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	Lanzarote is a lovely island.  We were there for 3 weeks in January and had a great time.  We have been there 3 times in all.  Playa Blanca is a nice resort and there are many lovely beaches on the island.

We stayed in Costa Teguise but toured the whole island. Have a lovely time. You can get to Papagayo beach by road.

IBMDQpmRaa	The rules are abundantly unclear. The DfT web site says that the limit for cabin baggage is 56cm, but they're contemplating suitcases, not umbrellas. I fear the real answer it that it depends on the mood of the people doing airline screening.
aqLLbzJQaa	You can indeed get on the tube at Terminal five - the Piccadilly line terminates there then goes through T123 and on to Central London.<br>  <br>  I am not sure which website you are using - but if you use the London Transport web at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/</a> - and when you use the journey planner make sure you select the advanced options - then untick all options except for tube - you will then be presented with tube options only, one other possible reason is that you are selecting a time and date when there are engineering works on the tube and you are being re-directed - the journey planner will normally tell you what is happening if the route is not what you expected.<br>  <br>  The prices for Travel cards for zones 1 to 9 can be found here :- <br>  <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/faresandtickets/seasontickets/4805.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/faresandti...</a> <br>  <br>  and the boundaries of those zones can be found on the London Underground map here :- <br>  <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/s...</a>  <br>  <br>  but you have me on details of zones 10,11 and 12 - I have never heard of those zones and I don't even know that they exist.<br>  <br>  ..
abp3QxOIaa	Two main reasons. First, screens that would be strong enough to prevent a bird from getting into the engine would be extremely heavy. The plane can only be so heavy before it won't fly. The airline would have to remove passenger seats to make up for the additional weight.<br>  <br>  The second and perhaps most important reason is that the screens themselves pose a much bigger danger to the engine than the bird. All  aircraft engines are designed to safely contain the damage caused by a bird ingestion. However if the screen were to come loose and get sucked into the engine it would likely cause what's called an "uncontained engine failure", where pieces of the engine come flying off in all directions at very high speed.|`|G2tnn5yjaa	It's idiotic answers like that that make me wonder if Capt.

The plain and simple truth is that geese are more intelligent than people give them credit for.

Vietnamese American businesses are ubiquitous in Little Saigon, located in Westminster and Garden Grove, where they constitute 30.7 and 21.4 percent of the population, respectively. States such as New York, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Florida, Virginia and to some extent, Rhode Island have fast growing Vietnamese populations. The San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle metropolitan area, Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Houston metropolitan area have sizable Vietnamese communities. Recently, the Vietnamese immigration pattern has shifted to other states like Oklahoma (Oklahoma City in particular) and Oregon (Portland in particular).|`|99C4rNpGaa	Shady Vietnamese Coffee shops, seriously, if you like those easy Viet types, you'll find them there.|`|FX6fDA7jaa	You can visit Little Saigon , it is big place for Vietnamese|`|AA11176669	Depend where you live..<br>  Try Vietsingle.com<br>  then narrow your search..may be you will get lucky|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Nail salons.|`|252cec80ec9f41b6ff4b6fccfa779c22aa	Asian Markets/Restaurants, volunteering at the Asian events,  organisations or church for Asian community they need volunteers all the time, I guess it also depends on which state you are in.

DrousONWaa	Orange Beach is my favorite place in the entire world and I plan on living there someday! Anyways, I've only stayed in one condo at Orange Beach, but we've stayed there since I was 5 years old. It's called Grand Pointe. It's right on the beach, but you can either stay in a condo that overlooks the beach or overlooks the bay. It's absolutely beautiful and the condos are nice. They have anywhere from 2-4 bedrooms and are nice and roomy. There is an indoor and outdoor pool, sauna, steam room, exercise room, and the most beautiful views of all Orange Beach. It's not as crowded as most condos would be because it is the last condo complex before you reach the bridge on the boulevard. That's why one side overlooks the bay =] Another good place is the Pheonix (any of them...there are millions, but slightly crowded in certain months).<br>             As for entertainment, The Wharf is in Gulf Shores but a great place to hang out, shop around, watch movies, and they have a huge variety of restaurants. There is also a huge ferris wheel and indoor mini golf. (If you like mini golf and go karts and all that go to Adventure Island. They have an awesome virtual roller coaster). The San Roc Marina also has good shopping and great restaurants and a cute little ice cream shop. It's right across the street from Grand Pointe (we walk there all the time). Parasailing is always a great experience and it's so fun! ABC Parasail is the one to go to. Just a quarter of a mile away from Grand Pointe and they are fantastic! (Ask for Captain Chuck and Benny). You will always see something fantastic. Jet ski rentals are also avaiable and deep sea fishing. (Both can be found in San Roc Marina). The fishing is great there! And I know you said no alcohol, but Florabama is the party place to go to. It's a bar across the bridge close to Perdido Key. Also, if it's raining, the Tanger Outlets has some good shopping. It's kind of in the Faulkner area, but still in Gulf Shores. I could go on and on about the restaurants but you must go to Bahama Bob's. It's in Gulf Shores and right on the beach. It's small, but has amazing food. I recommend the crawfish po boy. Also, LuLu's is a famous restaurant in Gulf Shores that is a great place to go eat. It's fun and usually has good bands. But go early! There's always a long wait. Calypso Joe's is new there but also very good. My favorites are Tacky Jackys, The Crab Trap (across the bridge), Bahama Bob's, LuLu's, The Original Oyster House, Calypso Joe's, Louisiana Langiappe (San Roc Marina), Doc's Seafood, and Zeke's Down Under ( I believe it's called something else now though).<br>         I hope this helps!

zdQWVaGsaa	'Oliver at Large' was a television series aired on JBC back in the late 80s. It starred Jamaica's most loved comedian Oliver Samuels and featured Volier Johnson. It's difficult to say exactly what it was about as there were different episodes shown every week. <br>  <br>  The main ones i can remember (and the most funny) was Oliver pretending to be an American preacher (a scam), Oliver at the airport trying to get to America (but not having a visa) and Oliver in jail for using his illegal taxi to kill and maim dogs but it was misinterpreted in prison and it was thought that he was a mass murderer (perhaps the funniest of the lot).

UIJorsD7aa	There IS a viable Philistine state.  It is called JORDAN.<br>  <br>  "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate," Prince Hassan of the Jordanian National Assembly was quoted as saying on February 2, 1970. <br>  <br>  Accordingly, Abdul Hamid Sharif, Prime Minister of Jordan declared, in 1980, "The Palestinians and Jordanians do not belong to different nationalities. They hold the same Jordanian passports, are Arabs and have the same Jordanian culture." <br>  <br>  In other words, Jordan is Palestine. Arab Palestine. There is absolutely no difference between Jordan and Palestine, nor between Jordanians and Palestinians (all actually Arabs). <br>  <br>  This fact is also confirmed by other Arabs, Jordanians and 'Palestinans' who were either rulers or scholars. <br>  <br>  "There should be a kind of linkage because Jordanians and Palestinians are considered by the PLO as one people," according to Farouk Kaddoumi, then head of the PLO Political Department, who gave the statement to Newsweek on March 14, 1977. Distinguished Arab-American Princeton University historian Philip Hitti testified before the Anglo-American Committee, <br>  <br>  "There is no such thing as 'Palestine' in history." <br>  According to Arab-American columnist Joseph Farah, <br>  "Palestine has never existed - before or since - as an autonomous entity. It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire, and briefly by the British after World War I. The British agreed to restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland. There was no language known as Palestinian. There was no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a Palestine governed by the Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc." <br>  These authoritative, honest statements are by Arabs, Jordanians and Palestinians, and absolutely must be taken at their face value and word. <br>  All right, so you're not quite into quotes. How about these tasteful tidbits of historical facts? <br>  <br>  * Jews, not Arabs, have lived continuously in the ancient Biblical Promised Land of Israel, especially Judea and Samaria, for 3,700 years. This land was given as a gift by G-d to the Children of Israel (Hebrews, Israelites, Jews) and is so stated in all of the three monotheistic religions' holy books - Old Testament, New Testament and Quran. Faithful followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all believe in the same one G-d and therefore must believe the word of their G-d. G-d does not make and break his promises. There is a very valuable lesson to be learned by all his children and faithful followers. <br>  * The current queen of Jordan is an Arab 'Palestinian'.|`|4aveC2aaaa	this is what was said in a hadith:<br>  <br>  Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Jews hide themselves behind stones and trees and the stones and the trees say, 'O Muslim!

But my answer is that it never will happen.  Israel has made darn good and sure of that.  So much land has been annexed, and so many settlers have infiltrated the West Bank, and believe me, they will not move them.  That coupled with the fact that Israel thwarts their efforts at every turn for the sake of their own 'security', that it makes this impossible.  There will never be peace there, mark my words.  They will slowly but surely push the Palestinians out.  We will see more of Gaza or even worse in the future.

OLXv3DEAaa	Astoria is a neighborhood in Queens, not a town:)<br>  Its actually a pretty decent area and not unsafe at all. There are a lot of Greek people (Greek restaurants), lots of immigrants and also young-ish people because the rents are still pretty cheap and its relatively quick to get to manhattan on the train. The crime rate is pretty low in Astoria compared to most areas. There are some more 'out of the way' areas where its probably higher but near Broadway, 30th Ave, Steinway etc its quite safe.<br>  <br>  Some areas of Queens are definitely bad news, Astoria is not though. Just not that exciting or interesting I guess?|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	Astoria, Queens, is a perfectly decent and safe middle class neighborhood.<br>  <br>  "Queens" does not mean "bad news". Queens is an entire borough, so it is a huge area. it's like saying you live in the USA, it means very little unless you're more specific.<br>  <br>  Astoria is like a "town" within Queens, and Queens is made up of many of these "towns" that grew and grew from the old days until they all touched each other and became this huge borough. but people still identify themselves with these historical towns, so that's why people refer to "Astoria" more than they do "Queens"...|`|vVolxFyRaa	lol yea astoria is mainly a greek area and its not the best place, but ive wallked through Astoria drunk off my ash and alone and never had any problems, theres a nice club called "Club 1" formerly "DNA" which is a good place to go to, but if you pass that club and you drive or walk away from the subway, then you'll be in the project aka the hood aka the ghetto lol so yea that part of Astoria you dont wanna be near at night, besides that theres not much to Astoria besides chinese people, greek people, and a few russians here and there.|`|h8OqX12Haa	i live in Ridgewood which is in Queens its really safe here <br>  as for astoria ive heard the same tihng thats its a pretty noise and unstable area i dont know why|`|Run7dyraaa	Let's just say Astoria,Queens is not considered the posh neighborhood. Queens has many towns, Glendale, Ridgewood, Rosedale, Springfield Gardens, none to write home about at all. Not a very pretty area, over populated, high crime, lots of traffic, noise. I was actually born there. Now I live in the beautiful and peaceful Pocono Mountains.  If you want to impress someone, tell them you were in the Hamptons.|`|qdzz6ZJkaa	Auroras is an idiot... don't even bother with her retarded response. <br>  <br>  Astoria is a good neighborhood with lots of shopping areas. Its favorable to many due to its proximity to Manhattan. Lots of different cultures but a huge Greek population is centered there. Lots of residential apartment buildings and houses.
5a328dcc94efb65565b23591fae9787caa	I was married in Jamaica 14 years ago, so things probably have changed a bit since then, however, you don't need a travel agent at all.<br>  <br>  Do your research on different resorts in the area you wish to stay, compare the resort amenities, location, price, etc, pick your resort, book it with Travelocity, Expedia, or directly with the airlines vacation site, and once all of that is done;<br>  <br>  Contact the resort directly and tell them that you are planning to marry in Jamaica.  Ask to speak with the resort coordinator for weddings.  They can handle pretty much everything you need.  <br>  <br>  Our coordinator was superb!  He did an excellent job and we did very little in preparations, he took care of most things.  <br>  <br>  Tip:  I have heard that Couples Resort in Negril and Ocho Rios do a great job with weddings!! We plan visit Jamaica soon to renew our vows, and we plan to do it one of their resorts.<br>  <br>  Sandals resorts are very pricey, and if you plan to do things off site, it may cost more than its worth, but you can check them out anyway.<br>  <br>  Make sure you pack your gown or dress and prepare it for the flight.  When we boarded the airplane I asked the stewardess to hang my gown for me and she did. She kept it until our flight landed.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and you will have a great time!

iN27E3WCaa	All of the CUNY community colleges are the same price, I believe.  It's not a problem to go to a 2 year school, get your associates and then go to a 4 year school.  It's cheaper to do that than to go to a 4 year school for your BS.  CUNY schools, even the 4 year schools, aren't expensive because they're public colleges.<br>  <br>  Don't go to Baruch for music, foreign languages or literature.  Baruch is mostly business-oriented and basically, everyone who isn't a business major is sort of a freak.  I graduated from Baruch, trust me on that.  If you'd like to go to a school with a large selection of humanities-based classes, check out Queens College or Hunter Collge, both very good schools in the CUNY system.
z6TI1ZDDaa	We're a state of wild rivers (The Rogue, The MacKenzie, The Umpqua) lots of boating, white water tours and fishing.  The Oregon Coast is breath taking, and all beaches are public owned.  Crater Lake Nat'l Park is in So. Oregon.  The Shakespear Festival in Ashland, OR is world renown.  Oregon wine is considered some of the finest anywhere and the Rogue Creamery in Central Point makes cheese judged best in the world by international judges.  Tons of micro brews, gourmet coffee drive throughs every other block and really nice people.  A year or so ago a survey by long haul truck drivers picked Oregon as #2 in the nation for scenic beauty.  Pick a region, find a homey B & B and ask them about local attractions.
AA10421518	The Peloponnesian War reshaped the Ancient Greek world. On the level of international relations, Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while Sparta was established as the leading power of Greece. The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, while Athens found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.  The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world.<br>  <br>  Greek warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities -- the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth-century-B.C. golden age of Greece.|`|LX7GBNbqaa	I think Min Tous is confusing the Peloponnesian War with the Battle of Marathon. The Battle of Marathon was fought in 490 BCE by the Athenians against the Persian invasion, and after their victory over the Persians, the Athenians formed the Delian League, which was basically a naval super power and united several of the Greek city states together with Athens, paying tribute or providing ships. Sparta had their own oligarchic powers in the Peloponnese, and several major city states were on the side of Sparta. When the Spartans feared that the Delian League was gaining too much power, they tried to force Athens to eliminate some of the naval power, which the Athenians refused to do. Finally, Sparta decided to march toward Athens and attack in 431 BCE, starting the Peloponnesian War, and attempting to destroy Athens before Athens could destroy Sparta. The war lasted thirty years, crippling the Athenian economy and army, and led to the death of their greatest leader, Pericles. Without his vision and dedication to Athens, the city fell to Sparta, and the Classical Golden Age of Greece was over. Sparta took power from Athens, but  this was short lived because Phillip of Macedon soon came and conquered both Sparta and Athens. This led to the Hellenistic age which spread over most of the known world at the time.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Really? I find that fascinating because the Battle of Marathon happened SIXTY years before the Peloponnesian War, and the purpose of the war was in NO way to unite the warring Greek city-states. It also did not have the effect of uniting the Greeks, because the Athenians kicked out the Spartans less than ten years later, and it was their LACK of unity that allowed Phillip of Macedon to come in and conquer all of Greece. Sorry, you are wrong, and don't try to insult my intelligence by saying I can't think for myself.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The Persian threat was OVER in 430 BC. It had been stopped and dealt with. Also, the city-states may have PRETENDED to be 'united' against the Persians, but Sparta and Athens were still enemies, and were looking out for their own interests, not the interests of Greece as a country. 3,000 years ago, that concept did not exist. The Peloponnesian war was between Athens and Sparta. It had absolutely nothing to do with Persians, and no unity for the greater good of Greece. I can excuse your spelling mistakes but your lack of even a decent and coherent sentence structure made it nearly impossible for me to understand what you were trying to say in your last edit and to respond.|`|Ue6nBmhlaa	Well I know that democracy was suspended and Athens was ruled <br>  by tyranny until the Corinthian war when afrer that democracy was<br>  restored again, Sparta stud up until the battle of Leuctra were <br>  they were defeated by Thebes and all this made the major cities <br>  of the south weak so Macedonia became the lead force<br>  in Greece|`|CJbSrsQdaa	Deep "greek" impact: <a href="http://www.chrisgeary.co.uk/international/Athens_MrGayGreece2004/Photo/Athens03Greece040.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrisgeary.co.uk/internationa...</a>|`|YU471WSsaa	the fact is that al thoguth both answers previous to mine are excellent answers .. the peoloponesian war was the first attempt to unite greeks as one nation.. and do away with waring greek states...but funny enough even as this was the first attempt  to do this... the waring states did come to fight toghter as a nation, the first invassion of the persian on greek soil..
KGUidL4daa	Packing:<br>  Southwest allows 2 checked bags with no fees, so I would recommend checking most of your stuff, only keeping the bare essentials in your carryon. You can't have any liquids more than 3 fluid ounces (figure those travel-size bottles) in your carryon, so stash shampoo and such in your checked bag.<br>  <br>  Before the flight:<br>  Southwest does not do meal service, so I would recommend buying a sandwich or a salad before entering the airport. Don't buy a drink, you'll have to throw it out or chug it when you get to security. GET TO THE AIRPORT AN HOUR BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT! NO EXCEPTIONS!<br>  <br>  Security:<br>  Security lines range from 5 seconds to 20 minutes. Since this is your first time flying, choose the "Green" lane. You'll have to take your shoes off and put your bag through a xray machine. (Being a guy, I have no idea about the jewelery situation)<br>  <br>  For the plane ride:<br>  Bring an iPod/CD Player/reading material/etc. You'll have to turn off your cell phone, and you won't get a signal at 10,000 feet or above anyway. They'll give you free drinks and peanuts.<br>  <br>  Other southwest tips:<br>  *Seating is not assigned on Southwest, like it is on most other airplanes. It is an "anything goes" system. If you have access to a computer, check in early online for a better seat.<br>  *If you're at least 15 and are "willing and able to help other passengers in an emergency situation", opt for the exit row seat. You'll get a lot more legroom.|`|EgZZjm6zaa	My first plan ride was last summer to vegas wit my best friend and our luggage got lost because we had to change plains in Denver. <br>  <br>  My recommendation always take a one-way flight.<br>  <br>   Anyways I would bring all your valuables like money, phone, camera, ipod and your purse. As far as what u can put on the carry-on is only 1oz liquids like little lotions and soaps. You can put your bigger bottles of liquid in your checked bag. From my experience of losing my luggage I would put a outfit, shoes, under-ware, swimsuit, phone charger(that's important if you want to make calls), and just everything you can fit into your carry-on that you may need in the next couple of days.<br>  <br>   Also turbulence is pretty scary at first but you get use to it...!|`|qmn2Iyypaa	bring your own headphones those put in your carry one bag, Because if you do'nt you will have to pay like 3 or 6$ for them ive been on soutwest but there are different soutwest planes yours might have a T.V.<br>  .Also bring a magazine the ones on the plane SUCK!!!|`|vITZgKthaa	if you take any electronic devices ..just remember to turn them off once the flight attendants announce for take off and landing<br>  <br>  Have a safe flight|`|AOPuoo16aa	Here is what you can and cannot take on the plane.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/p...</a>

They must maintain an orderly flow of air traffic and provide useful information and instructions needed for the safe execution of aircraft in-flight. In cases of emergency they must notify the relevant search and rescue organizations. <br>  <br>  Air traffic controllers work in well-equipped control centres with the most modern electronic equipment and navigational instruments at their disposal. <br>  <br>  Air traffic control is a 24-hour service and air traffic controllers are therefore required to work shifts. <br>  <br>  Requirements<br>  What kind of personality do I need? Air traffic controllers must be sincerely interested in aviation and they must indicate a willingness to accept responsibility. They must be able to achieve a professional attitude in their career. Air traffic controllers must have good memory, hearing and eyesight. They must behave calmly and rationally when under pressure and they must be able to remain alert for long periods of time.|`|6egxGam6aa	I'm not an air traffic controller myself, but I had to say that I find this a bit disconcerting. I hope this is a rarity among ATCs.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Those dudes standing on the tarmac holding those flashing light sticks ~ you ran over one of them didn't you.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Most of them spend their time trolling on the Internet, just like you.|`|G2tnn5yjaa	Hey Cap!

What else can they do while no one is radioing in?|`|FkT7VlvGaa	How scary- you dont still fly do you?|`|oi1TigGraa	An Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) is located at every airport with regularly scheduled flights and handles all landing, takeoff, and ground traffic. The Clearance Delivery, Ground Control, and Local Control controllers in the Control Tower direct and monitor all aircraft taxi, takeoff, and landing at the airport. A Clearance Delivery controller checks the flight plan and gives clearance to a pilot for flight plan information. Ground Controllers instruct all aircraft movement on the ground at the particular airport (push back from gate and taxi to and from runways). Local Controllers issue takeoff and landing clearances on the particular airport's runways to departing and arriving aircraft. After takeoff clearance is given, the Local Controller instructs the pilot to change frequencies and contact the Departure Controller in the TRACON facility. Likewise, after landing clearance is given, the Local Controller instructs the pilot as to initial taxi instructions and instructs the pilot to change frequencies and contact Ground Control.<br>  <br>  I'm sure flying into a small northern California airport is relatively straightforward for both pilot and air traffic controller. But contrast that with what goes on 24 hours a day 365 days a year at one of the busier airports, such as Atlanta (currently the world's busiest airport) with multiple runways handling simultaneous takeoffs and landings one after the other all day every day. I'm sure the ATCs there are quite busy.<br>  <br>  Other air traffic facilities in addition to airport control towers where air traffic controllers work include: terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities; air route traffic control centers; flight service stations; and the air traffic control system command center.

However, you will be competing with the Canadian kids for a place on the team and since they start skating as soon as they can walk, that might bit a bit hard for you.  You could do just as well if you try to get a hockey scholarship to a college in the US.  If you are good enough, you will make the NHL regardless.|`|U1kfGKx1aa	I am not too sure....First, I guess, you need to take an immigration test.

You are going to spend money there - that alone will make the locals happy.<br>  <br>  Yes, tips are included on your bill in restaurants, so just a little extra if you liked food and service. Don't change the menu either. you get what is printed everything else is extra. If you have the time and can afford it, eat in places not belonging to a chain, to get acquainted with local food. Try a curry wurst or Doener at a stand, it is very good.<br>  <br>  Yes, english is now taught in elementary classes (before grade 5). Young people at least understand english.

wzM5WB8Xaa	I live in Saskatchewan, and there was recently a CNN news story on how we were the only place in North America to see unemployment drop in 2008. They are projecting a further drop in 2009, which is kind of insane, because it is already below 4%. I think that we live really well here, but Canada in general tends to be expensive when it comes to taxation, housing, etc. In terms of geography of the prairie provinces, Saskatchewan is very flat and kind of boring, Manitoba has a lot of trees and is a little more hilly, but generally is similar to Saskatchewan, and Alberta has a higher elevation. Alberta and BC are very pretty, partly because of the Rockies and partly because the cities are kept up very well.
NM1L4B0Vaa	If you don't know any farmers, you should speak to someone who works in a veterinary or meat shop who may help you with contacts.<br>  <br>  In order to look after them, here are directions for a pet sheep/lamb:<br>  <br>  Basic management of pet sheep<br>  <br>  Revised by Deborah Maxwell, Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries<br>  <br>  Anyone thinking of obtaining pet sheep to keep at their suburban home, kindergarten, institution or hobby farm should consider the following points very seriously:<br>  <br>  Area - will the area where you intend to run your sheep provide sufficient feed all year round?<br>  <br>  Water - have you got a good supply of clean drinking water for your sheep?<br>  <br>  Fencing - do you have a sound fence that will contain your sheep and exclude stray dogs?<br>  <br>  Parasites - do you realise sheep are susceptible to blowfly strike, lice and worms, and require regular management to prevent and treat infestations?<br>  <br>  Shearing - do you know that sheep need to be shorn at least once a year? They should also be crutched at least once between shearings. Can you do it yourself or do you know someone who can?<br>  <br>  Caring for lambs - do you have the time to feed an orphan lamb every 3 to 4 hours in the first 2 weeks and to continue looking after it?<br>  <br>  Diseases - are you prepared to provide adequate veterinary care?<br>  <br>  The above points are expanded below to enable new owners to appreciate fully their commitments in owning pet sheep.<br>  Area<br>  <br>  A sheep prefers short, green grass to tall, dry grass. An amount of 1 kg of dry matter is required each day to maintain a 40 kg dry sheep. Pregnant or lactating ewes will need up to twice this amount.<br>  <br>  The total weight of grass that a sheep eats depends on the moisture content, for example one dry sheep will need to consume 5 kg of lush pasture, which has 80 per cent moisture, to get 1 kg of dry matter.<br>  <br>  On very lush pasture animals may lose condition because they do not have the capacity to take in enough grass to satisfy their dry matter requirements. Similarly, on very poor quality grass they may get enough to satisfy their appetite but the nutrient content may be too low to sustain them.<br>  <br>  Depending on grass quality, half to one hectare may be needed to run one sheep for a year. If this area is not available it will be necessary to hand feed. Up to 1 kg a day of good lucerne hay could be needed.<br>  Water<br>  <br>  Sheep need a good supply of clean drinking water. Provide at least 4.5 litres each day for a sheep, while pregnant and lactating ewes need more. A sheep on dry grass needs more water than one on green grass. All troughs, tubs and water containers should be scrubbed out at least once a week.<br>  Fencing<br>  <br>  A stock-proof fence is essential. Attack by dogs is a big problem when sheep are kept close to town. Pet dogs can be just as destructive as wild or stray dogs. A 180 cm high netting fence buried up to 30 cm into the ground will keep dogs out.<br>  <br>  If dog-proof boundary fences are not available, provide a pen in which to shelter your sheep at night. The pen should be roofed and have netting sides buried well into the ground.<br>  <br>  Subdivisional fencing can be either mesh wire (hinge joint or ring lock) or a plain wire fence with five or six strands. This will contain sheep but will not exclude dogs. Both types must be tightly strained. Some thought should be given to barbed wire strands at the top and bottom of the fence line.<br>  <br>  Electric wires offset on an old fence will make it stock proof and dog proof. This type of fence needs an energiser (battery or mains powered) with well-insulated wire. This type of fence should be clearly marked to warn people that it is electrified.<br>  Parasites<br>  <br>  Sheep have external and internal parasites peculiar to themselves that are unlikely to affect owners or their children. The main parasites are listed below for easy recognition and early treatment.<br>  External parasites<br>  <br>  Blowfly strike is caused by a green blowfly that lays eggs in warm weather on moist parts of the sheep's wool. The eggs hatch into small, cream maggots that live on the sheep. The maggots' toxic secretions can kill the sheep if left untreated.<br>  <br>  Fly struck wool should be clipped off together with some of the clean wool around it. A pair of sheep shears or large scissors will do. A liquid or powder chemical registered as a blowfly strike dressing should then be applied to the area. You must wear gloves and protective clothing and apply the chemical according to the instructions on the label. This kills the maggots and also dries the area, making it unattractive to further flystrike. The wool that is clipped off should be burnt or disposed of in a sealed plastic bag.<br>  <br>  In warm, humid or wet weather when blowflies are active, a suitable chemical solution of 4.5 l can be mixed and very slowly poured onto the sheep. Rub it well into the wool down to skin level, around the sheep's rear end (crutch), on the belly of male sheep and horns of rams.<br>  <br>  Sheep lice are small pale insects up to 1 mm long, wit
kgBPU4xxaa	Venice is one of the most expensive cities here. How much to budget depends on what you do. A gondola ride is 80 euro for less than an hour. If you want a day pass for the vaporetto, the cost is 18 euro for 24 hr (there are other options) <a href="http://www.actv.it/english/home.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.actv.it/english/home.php</a> ; however, you can walk everywhere unless you want to go see Murano, Burano, Lido or some of the other outlying islands. Food can be very expensive, but you can also get pizza by the slice or pannini for 5.50 to 6.50 euro. There's a place in Campo San Stefano where there is pretty good Bruschetta for around 8 euro. You can also easily pay 50 euro or more for a meal in some of the restaurants. One note: some things (especially fish) can be priced per etto - that's the price for each 100 g. The weight will be taken for the whole fish before preparation. This can end up being VERY expensive if you choose a large fish. If you sit in one of the cafés in Piazza San Marco, the price of a coffee will vary depending on whether the combo is playing or not. There's a charge for the music and also a charge for table service. It's much cheaper to buy a coffee at the walk-up window near the tower. This isn't to say that a place like Florian's or Quadri isn't a good experience; just be aware of what it will cost you if you're on a tight budget.<br>  <br>  Florence is small enough that you don't need taxis. You can walk to all the attractions. Count on 25 to 50 euro for a meal, but you could eat cheaper if you want. A pizza, for example, will be around 10 euro.<br>  <br>  Train prices depend on the type of train, the class of service, and where you're going. You can work out schedules and prices here: <a href="http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=3fdbe14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/i...</a>

xIHgTqVhaa	Thankfully, those flying with babies and small children are exempt from the 3oz. liquid limit imposed on other passengers. I should clarify that the "liquids" (milk, formula, juice) should be intended for the child, which is exactly what you are proposing. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/children/formula.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/c...</a><br>  <br>  You don't even have to put it in the required bag. Just show it to them as you pass through security.<br>  <br>  I'm a former Flight Attendant and I fly a lot with my three kids. I suggest you do what I do and just bring what you want for your baby. The worst that can happen is that it's taken away. No one will scold or lecture you. I've only had water bottles taken (for my kids but they decided to not let those through). <br>  <br>  As far as the car seat is concerned, it is never a good idea to rent one from a car rental company. I had a bad experience with this and I'm not alone. It could easily be dirty, outdated, missing parts, the wrong size, etc. Without the manual, it's not sure if you can install it correctly. This is too important a safety item to leave it up to the company. <br>  <br>  What is even worse, if you read the tiny fine print, they don't guarantee that there will even be a seat when you get there. You wouldn't be the first parents to arrive at the counter to find this out the hard way.<br>  <br>  Another issue, the rental car companies charge a lot for their car seats. If you pay $10 day, keep in mind that a Cosco Scenera can often be found for as little as $40. This is a good basic seat that I used with my little ones. For using their ratty seat, you could have bought a brand new one for less.<br>  <br>  Your baby is also much safer and more comfortable in her familiar seat on the plane. This is the recommendation of the FAA, AAP and other organizations. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_children/crs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_childr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/travelsafetytips.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/tra...</a><br>  <a href="http://ashsd.afacwa.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID=2777" rel="nofollow">http://ashsd.afacwa.org/?zone=/unionacti...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.thecarseatlady.com/airplanes/airplanes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecarseatlady.com/airplanes/...</a><br>  <a href="http://otoh.org/opal/carseat.html" rel="nofollow">http://otoh.org/opal/carseat.html</a><br>  <br>  If you didn't purchase a ticket for her, see if the flight is full and if not, perhaps they can put an empty place next to you so that you can use your car seat in it. Be nice as this is a big favor. <br>  <br>  Never check a car seat in as luggage. It can get broken and/or lost this way. Many parents will say their car seats were "fine" after doing this but the damage isn't always visable and they may be driving around in an unsafe seat and not know it. Remember that they are only designed to withstand one accident and if they were roughly treated, their reliability is now in doubt. Let's hope they never find out (which they only would if they were in an accident). <br>  <br>  If you can't use your car seat on board, take it to the gate. There are two advantages to this. First, it gives you up to the last minute to see if there is a free seat for you to use. Second, if it can't come on board, it will be "gate-checked",  going down with the wheelchairs and strollers, thus treated a bit more gentle.<br>  <br>  For more information, nine years ago I wrote an article on this subject. It's based on both my personal and professional experience of flying with kids. I go into more detail on car seats, including the question of how to transport them through the airport. <br>  <br>  It's totally non-commercial and other parents from around the world have contributed.

Be sure to read the whole page.   Any car seats rented by car rental companies would have to be "good"...in compliance with the law.  You would need to call the rental company you are going to use, or call the airline about how they classify the car seat you carry...each airline has their own policy.

You do need to get a Visa in advance, but it's pretty easy.<br>  <br>  My husband couldn't be without his passport (he travels a lot), but I could, so I got my Visa by mail (took 4 weeks) and he drove to DC and got one in person at the Indian embassy (took 1 day). <br>  <br>  I just went to the website to refresh how, and it looks like things have changed just after I went.

nxHztcslaa	yes my husband... my kids... my family.. lol|`|AA12159695	Yes I do. Me..........|`|IwtQzbY9aa	No. But if you go to the Niger....I'm SURE you will find some!!!
qdzz6ZJkaa	I guess they mean you don't have the street smarts, you're just book smart. BIG difference that has nothing to do with intelligence. Street smarts comes with experience. But having family already in BK is a good step to getting settled in so you shouldn't need to worry so much, they're just looking out for your well being.|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	you're right, your family is insulting you! whether or not you are "sheltered" has nothing to do with your being a 23 yo capable of making her own decisions. it's true that you may be making a mistake by moving to Brooklyn, but that mistake will be entirely your own, and you won't know until you do it anyway, so just go for it, enjoy the adventure, and learn from it. it could very well be the best experience if your life!<br>  <br>  your family is just projecting their own insecurities on to you, don't fall for it!<br>  <br>  if not now, when? if you obsess about it, you'll eventually find an excuse not to do anything!|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Your family may be right. This is not the best time for a 23 year old to be moving to the city. The city is expensive. There are bad parts of Brooklyn like Bed-Stuy and East New York. The good parts like Brooklyn Heights aren't affordable. The city is a nice place to visit, but impossible to live in unless you make 6 figures.|`|beO40ap7aa	Look at something on the ocean side like stuff between Bay Ridge and Sheepshead Bay in South Brooklyn and if you find a reasonably priced piece of property and like the area, youll be all right.|`|qeLeCQlyaa	I do not agree with the first answer.<br>  <br>  I live in Brooklyn, in a beautiful safe close-to-the-city area and do not make six figures.<br>  <br>  And you are correct: Millions of people have moved to NY from all corners of the world and made a good life for themselves.  <br>  <br>  Also, as you know, there is work for RNs EVERYWHERE, including NY.  And being an RN, you will be able to make enough to afford your own apartment eventually, even in the nicer parts of Brooklyn.  Not a luxury place, but a decent apartment certainly.<br>  <br>  I absolutely love Brooklyn.  I think you will too and to me you sound the opposite of unprepared.  I'm not sure why your family is saying what they are saying.  Hopefully they will be OK to live with for a while, see that you are fine and things will be good.  If not, you'll find your own place as soon as you can.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!
nxHztcslaa	in the uk you just have to have completed all your childhood jabs... then they give you one to boost them... maleria tablets is the most important thing... and if you are staying in the city its not needed to get a yellow fever shot.. but if you are planning to get into wild life then its best to get that too... visit your doctor and get everything checked out before you go!!|`|2OU9JBRaaa	I'm Nigerian but I'm sorry I don't know dat.
TKHHRUB4aa	Going along with your above given example, in a hypothetical manner of speaking, if I would be a rape victim and later finds out that I am pregnant, I will have to terminate my pregnancy with abortion.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, as what others had answered before me, its the choice of giving birth and have it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Well, as you can see the latter speaks of pro-life but its not for anyone to decide whether the baby lives or not but this decision should come from the rape victim itself.<br>  <br>  I wonder, why would someone being raped would want to be pregnant for nine months and then give up the baby for adoption? Is it a guilt of conscience or society judging against the rape victim?|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	It is really difficult to decide which is the more moral or the logical thing to do in this kind of situation.  You not only think of the unborn child but has to consider the mother and her situation or the circumstance that brought her into it.<br>  <br>  In this case, the mother needs psychological and spiritual help to guide her through her difficulty.  They can help enlighten her and bring her to a decision that will work best for her and the baby without sacrificing anything in the name of morality or righteousness.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, she can always give the baby up for adoption if she cannot find it in her heart to forgive her attacker or accept the idea of raising the child herself.  Better that than to go for abortion  which, to me, is the most grievous sin of all.|`|YALlJatBaa	I am not a fan of dispatching fetuses, either, but I am a fan of Dr.Gregory House.<br>  <br>  There is one case when the question was:  Save the mother by operation which kills the fetus,  or wait, but place the mother in grave danger.   His opinion was to kill the fetus, but the hospital's director, his boss, was there in the operating room.  And turns out, that baby on the patient's womb, was scheduled for adoption by her (the director).<br>  And his boss was going to electrecute House should he attempt to sever the umbilical cord.  Dr.House kept insisting it is only a fetus yet, not yet a child, but the Director insists it is already a child.<br>  <br>  I tend to agree with House.   If it is a choice between the mother and the unborn fetus,  and there is a medical crisis,  I'd choose the mother's life.<br>  <br>  If there was no medical crisis,  abortion is still illegal in the Philippines and we should abide by the law.<br>  <br>  The mother can then change her mind later if, after holding the baby in her arms, she finds she adores the baby.   If not, the baby goes to the care of the State which enforces the no-abortion rule, anyway, and should, therefore, stand by its principles.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Take it or leave it, it is her child!  Killing the child is totally out of option.<br>  If she is not ready nor willing to take care of the innocent life, then the option is to look for someone who would want to adopt the child.  Either any childless couple or immediate members of the family, or the last resort, adoption center.|`|CuYQ57mjaa	In my opinion a raped victim getting pregnant could resort to giving her child for adoption after birth.  But she can resort to abortion if she turned pregnant due to incest rape in the premise of medical and legal consequences.|`|AA11118890	my personnal thought is that the woman should have the baby but if she doesn't want to raise it, put it up for adoption|`|EgZZjm6zaa	I think abortion is a bad idea. Maybe giving the child up for adoption will be better because honestly I don't think I would be able to take care of a child of my rapist.|`|Q1hti9ywaa	I would rather endure another 9 months of pregnancy and later on submit the baby for adoption. Life is life...atleast I know in my heart I didn't kill anybody much more my own flesh.|`|7ONAv4vYaa	She must keep it for 9 months in her womb.<br>  There is a Catholic orphanage that helps mother who cannot take care of there baby but not total give up on them. Where they can visit their child and when they are ready they can claim their child. If they won't claim their child they can have a signed agreement to have the child for adoption.<br>  <br>  Just contact the nearest parish church for information.<br>  <br>  Spare innocent blood.<br>  <br>  The first part of the baby to develop is the nervous system. If you'll kill the baby he can already feel the great pain. Just image how painful being wounded or having a toothache to a baby who's body parts are torn apart or burned by chemicals.
GEUU9q2Paa	Blue Hawaiian Helicopter is a first-class company whose helicopters have large windows and individual luxury seats (not bench seats).  They fly big modern Eco-Star helicopters that hold six passengers, so that is the type of helicopter you should ride in.  As far as which area of Maui to see by helicopter, I suggest the Haleakala crater and the rainforest on the way to Hana.<br>  <br>  There is a comparison of the various Maui helicopter companies on this page:<br>  <a href="http://www.mauihawaii.org/maui-activities/helicopter-tours.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mauihawaii.org/maui-activitie...</a>|`|V2A4Y1Meaa	Try My intergrated Custom Search on Google<br>  Upper links may help you<br>  Bookmark For future Searches<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-6828716762099822:kwm6ort73pj&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=tour+helicopter+maui&sa=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub...</a>|`|URZNtrxsaa	I highly recommend Blue Hawaiian. They have the BEST safety record on the islands and also fly the new Eco-Star choppers (make sure you ask for one) that are extremely comfortable and offer great visibility, even if you have one of the two inner seats (the back row is 4 seats).. We have flown them twice and while there are cheaper services, I go with the best!!<br>  <br>  Mahalo
pTLcvsVfaa	Its incredible. You actually will spoil yourself though.. so be careful.<br>  <br>  I did it at Mandalay Bay in May. Its next to impossible to get a seat by the pool that time of year at Mand Bay, so we decided to get a cabana. Well worth the money.|`|q6kvVkNPaa	I was just there this summer but we stayed at the Palazzo (rely nice hotel) there pool cabanas looked really nice and i wish we rented them out.. i've never seen what the Caesars pool cabanas looked like but maybe they have a picture of them online or something.. if you are planning on staying by the pool a lot i suggest you rent the cabana. if u dnt then it is very hard to get a chair... lol i wish we did but now i no for next time! <br>  <br>  hope this helps and enjoy ur trip! :)
McI4AAlmaa	Man only on 2011...<br>  Well, i think a good tip to choose a place is to put everything on paper, you know, ask about what climate you guys most like, what kind of travel you plan(adventure, cultural...), how much cash you plan to spend then after you decide everything, you can find a proper place that suits everybody.<br>  But is if you want so suggestions i will recommend South America, there you can find really beautiful places with nice prices a cool options, but one that i totaly recommend is Rio de Janeiro, man that place is wonderful, it also called the "Wonderful City", i read an interesting article in wikipedia about Rio: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_De_Janeiro" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_De_Jane...</a> <br>  I think that city has almost everything to any taste, i did a crazy river rafting and enjoyed the colonial buildings of imperial age... <br>  A good option too is the nightlife... really cool, and everybody is welcoming, the beaches are stunning, you will not get tired of that city so easily.<br>  <br>  So whatever you choose another important tip that you can keep in mind if you wanna save money is to buy everything from an agency, cause they used to have better prices(even better than book directly from hotels) and you can count with some support on your trip, in rio i used this one: <a href="http://www.riodejaneiro-hotels.travel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.riodejaneiro-hotels.travel/</a> they are really reliable and cheap, and the most important thing is to find some agency that have a local office, cause with that you can count with a real good service, it's the case of this agency of Rio.<br>  <br>  Hope I have helped.<br>  Good Luck|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Head to NYC.|`|HJB1P7Doaa	it depends on how much you have to spend, if you have to take time off from your job, how are you going to get there stuff like that. You have to plan now not much  time left
f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, the best thing to tell you is call the parking garage owner and inquire about the parking rate. The phone number is (201) 216-6744. <br>  <br>  Good luck
mF8GbnJraa	Giovanni Brusca (born May 20, 1957 in San Giuseppe Jato) is a former member of the Sicilian Mafia. He murdered the anti-Mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone in 1992 and once stated that he had committed between 100 and 200 murders but was unable to remember the exact number. He was sentenced to life in prison "in absentia", captured in 1996 and started to cooperate with the authorities.<br>  <br>   A podgy, bearded and unkempt mafioso, Brusca was known in Mafia circles as "U' Verru" (in Sicilian) or "Il Porco" or "Il Maiale", (In Italian: The Pig, The Swine) or "lo scannacristiani" (people-slayer; in Italian dialects the word "christians" often stands for "humans"). <br>  His father Bernardo Brusca, a local Mafia patriarch, served concurrent life sentences for numerous homicides. <br>  By the age of 20, Brusca was reportedly working as a driver for Bernardo Provenzano.<br>  Giovanni Brusca was one of the most powerful Mafia leaders between Riina’s arrest in January 1993 and his own in May 1996.<br>  Brusca had received a life sentence the previous year after being convicted "in absentia" of murder and he was subsequently convicted of the bomb attack that killed the Anti-Mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone near Capaci.|`|hD9k6OQvaa	yeah he's alive, and idk what prison he's in all i read was something about "in absentia"
8WRqyvJhaa	Yes I lived there for almost 3 years. Yes, everyone speaks Italian, some also speak english (probably b/c of the military base there).  AND NO, the people are not like the movies..The people I have encountered were kind and once they got to know me, were even nicer to me.  They love children.  (My daughter was born there)<br>  <br>  If you are moving there, you'll love it.  Buy a Rosetta Stone language CD, book or whatever. Learn basic phrases and enjoy it! We did!<br>  <br>  Everything is "Ciao Bella or bedda (Sicilian dialect)" how bad could that be?  ^_^|`|IvMPh09baa	my husband is from Sicily, Catania to be exact.<br>  <br>  Its beautiful there... but seasons are very dramatic, summer time is very very hot... hotter than new york.<br>  <br>  yes... everyone speaks italian, but most speak the sicilian - catanian dialiect... this is a different dialect then regular italian.<br>  <br>  how exactly do the movies perceive them to be?<br>  <br>  i dont know what that means... my husband is sicilian and most sicilians are big family people and prideful, geloso... some say.|`|CDhn1NrKaa	Yes I have been in Sicily. It's very beautiful! The movies... are only movies|`|fc07dd4e0ddbeae20f8e69ce27280ee3aa	I'm italian, not from Sicily, I'm from Napoli and live in Tuscany. I've been in Sicily many times. Sicilian people are probably the most friendly and warm-hearted people in world and Sicily is a miracle of natural and cultural beauty. Not sure a life can be defined a real life if you haven't seen Sicily. Any sicilian speaks italian of course, plus most speak sicilian too, but that means nothing, sicilian is just a dialect, but all sicilians speak italian, they are italian lol. For the movie stuff, any sicilian is different from another. Why don't u try to be more specific? What exactly do you want to know about them.|`|uyHhTZZUaa	I suggest the baroque triangle: Ragusa Ibla, Noto and Modica.<br>  Those are almost undiscovered perls.
kgBPU4xxaa	I live near Venice and take the train when making this trip. It's a much more relaxing way to go than driving. Given that you're stopping along the way, the obvious way points for a three day trip would be Florence and Rome. If you've seen those cities, then there are several other places you could consider - Arezzo, Orvieto, and Perugia (off the direct route, but not far) are all interesting. Pompeii is a train stop between Naples and Sorrento on the Circumvesuviana line, but you could easily see that as a day trip from Sorrento also.|`|623b4528989c9d444aee5f6f866efb06aa	Just looked it up on google.earth. to drive from Venice via Bologna, Firenze, Caserta, to Sorrento is about 500 miles and should take about seven (7) hours or less depending how fast the traffic is on E45<br>  <br>  Go to yahoo.maps from Venice, Italy to Sorrento, italy. it will give you a pretty good idea of the places along the way.<br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  If you are staying in Sorrento, do it. You already have lost one day on the road. If you plan on going back to Venice, you can only spend one day in sorrento before the drive back to Venice. Doesn't leave you much time to stop elsewhere.|`|pS4e5OtZaa	The obvious answer (to me) is to take the train to Florence then the train to Rome, then the train to Naples. There isn't train service to Sorrento so you'll need to rent a car in Naples. On your way to Sorrento you can visit Pompeii. Wherever you decide to go, taking the train is better. Not only is there the cost of the rental, but the cost of the gas, tolls and parking.
dSxEVT7Laa	You may check the cebu pacific website.<br>  <br>  If there are promos, you can book a roundtrip ticket  from Manila to HK for 7-9K.<br>  <br>  But regular fare rate seems to be 15-18K.<br>  <br>  But try to check cebu pacific and philippine airlines' websites for the exact amount.|`|VGMFkcziaa	visit www.cebupacific.com<br>  <br>  they travel from Manila to Hong Kong vice versa and from Clark to Hong Kong vice versa.
urHPuzMsaa	Not a good time as jobs are few and far between. If there is a job opening they will hire someone who has been in Vegas for awhile rather than a new move. Read this webpage about moving to Vegas.|`|dFBccLExaa	Really depends on your job market whether it's worth it to move. I have found more work here than in any of the other cities I've lived in in the past year, but many people are having issues finding work. <br>  If you do move here, you'll want to stay out of north Vegas and Central Vegas. Stay to Summerlin or Henderson. Anything on the south side below the 215 is a safe bet. Same with anything labeled "Green Valley", "7 Hills" or "Aliante." But remember that in this city, when it comes to apts, you get what you pay for. Expect to pay at least $800 a month for something decent. Houses are easy to come buy if you have the money to buy them. <br>  For jobs, hit up casinos, look on craig's list, and the newspaper. I've had the best luck with cl.|`|AA11536773	If you have a job waiting for you, then make the move. If you don't already have a line on a job, don't do it. Unemployment is 10% right now and there's 100 applicants or more for each job out here. As far as best places to live - either Summerlin, Henderson, or the southwest side of the city. It's definitely cheaper than Boston, but like I said, unless you have a guaranteed job here, you're going to have a hard time finding one.|`|AA10240904	Because of the economy my answer is do NOT move.  The unemployment is 10% and growing.  State, county and cities have frozen hiring.  Casinos are laying off basic employees and management.  Businesses are closing including two major pharmacies.  The State is billions in debt.  Crime is up, traffic is awful.  Housing foreclosure is the highest in the country.  Apartments are pricey since they know they can get it, e.g., $1400 for 2 bed or higher.|`|mQhqRbRQaa	I would say definitely in Summerlin.  It's a calm, nice, rich neighborhood with nice cars and big houses.  My mom used to live there.  I loved it!|`|8VrlRUfhaa	Vegas economy is in the dumps right now. If you have cash...you can get a good buy on a house. Jobs are bleak at best.
EOE8YgJmaa	You know that CT is nothing like California or Florida, right? It gets pretty cold for most of the year. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for high class, check out these towns: Litchfield, Greenwhich, Fairfield, Southbury.
Kbgm0TM3aa	The Holiday Inn on the Beach is a good choice.  I am not sure if they allow people under 21 to book though.  Last time I checked the Ramada allowed 18 year olds to book.  It is not right on the beach but it is an easy walk.  Check out the link below for more details and room rates.|`|mQhqRbRQaa	Holiday Inn Destin on the Beach.  I am a reservations agent and I make reservations for them all the time.  Its beautiful, probably around 90$ a night, with a bar and a lounge and its right on the beach!
54f31ab3782d5867a302804aeea8499caa	The small signs are kilometer markers to let you know exactly where you are  and so you can tell emergency services where you are. All the motorways and some major trunk roads like the A1,A6 etc have them. They are also useful for finding how well your journey is progressing...eg at rush hour on the M25 you might find you did five kilometers in half and hour haha......and for finding how long your journey is and  when you are getting close to a turn-off you want. A friend might say on the phone for example that he'll be waiting at the exit road by kilometer 46...if you join the M25 near kilometer 10 you know you've got 36 kilometers to drive. Also good for identifying places you might want to return to. For example you may see an interesting building,or lake,or whatever. Noting the next kilometer sign lets you easily identify the place later on a map. A place in the north of England had some interest for me a couple of weeks ago as I passed on a National Express coach on the M6. Counting the kilometer signs to the next junction made it easy to look at the place  at home later using Google Earth,and to mark it on the AA road map , just over six kilometers from Junction 29 into Preston.....Why they use decimals and not just whole numbers has me stumped,but it's a government job,so there's probably some obscure reason that wouldn't make sense to anyone else. Maybe the firm that makes them is on the old-boy network and gets paid more for using more numbers.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	They are marker signs! If you breakk down, simply give that number to the operator who answers the emergency phone and they can pinpoint your location from that.|`|4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	So you can tell the AA where you'e stuck.

cRBItRpsaa	$ 6000|`|ad8dOQVWaa	Take night trains when you can, and sleep while you travel (save on a hostel for a night!) Honestly, if you seriously economize you can get by on $50 a day, but you have to eat next to nothing and not buy anything.  I'd suggest you plan for $100 a day, and maybe toss in an extra 100 or 200 to be on the safe side.
nlRr07dRaa	I know in  fort lauderdale they have the hard rock casino where ana nicole died. it actually is quite the happening spot! i think it is called the seminal hard rock casino. if that's what you're asking about. it's practically smack dab in the middle of Ft Laudy!

If you mean St. Peter's Basilique you won't find so many frescos or murals, but principally statues or stuff like that.<br>  <br>  If you mean the Vatican Museums, well, there you'll find one of the biggest picture galleries of the world, with works of Michelangelo (like the Sistine chapel), Raffaello, Caravaggio, Salvador Dalì, etc.etc.|`|896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	They are many, actually, and I don't  know if anyone ever counted or measured them. One thing is sure: you can't miss those from Michelangelo (Sistine Chapel) and Raffaello (they call them Le stanze di Raffaello, the best known is Signatura Room)

Mxr6AIkiaa	We do go the shorter way, generally.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Aircraft flying non-stop for long distances over the oceans do use the shortest routes, known as great circle routes. You need to look on a globe with a piece of string to understand the shortest distance. Stretch the string between the two points and it will be the great circle route. Go to your school library and try it.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|VlhmbHGGaa	I'm not sure I understand your question so I apologize if I'm wrong.<br>  <br>  Airplanes indeed travel the shortest way to their destination. However there are some exceptions. Sometimes they must fly a path that allows for a reasonable alternative airport if some emergency occurs. <br>  <br>  But in general they will fly the shortest path to the destination. Remember the Earth is a sphere so what looks like the shortest path on a 2D map isn't always so when you look at a 3D globe.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	I do not understand what you mean. But pilots always try to map out the shortest route possible. They may have to take a little bit longer of a route, though, because of some restricted airspace, recently issued notams that restrict aircraft from entering a certain area, etc.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Hawaii is the most remote island on earth - it isn't really near anything, so it might not be the best example.<br>  I am not sure what you are asking exactly. Airlines do take the shortest route as it is the most cost effective.
1zgWUTXZaa	Paris can be expensive, but that's mostly in the really touristy areas. One of the best places for cheap shopping is the St-Ouen flea market in the northern part of the city. At the flea markets, the price they tell you for an item is pretty much never final, bargaining is encouraged. For cheap food, go to the supermarket. There's a Monoprix by the Cluny Metro stop that has food downstairs. If you're on your own for lunch, one of the best places to go is the Blanche Metro stop (line 2). Walk up the Rue Lepic, next to the Moulin Rouge, and there's a bakery on the right hand side of the street. You can get a good size sandwich on baguette, a drink, and dessert for 6 Euros there. Even if you don't go for lunch, drop by there for the tarte au chocolat. It's probably the best dessert I've ever had. In general, I recommend Montmartre for shopping, food, and general charm. The flight depends on where you're flying out of. Usually you'll end up on a short flight from wherever you are to a major airport like New York, Chicago, Detroit, or DC, or if you're flying Lufthansa, you'll fly into Frankfort then take a short flight to Paris. Either way, unless you're on the west coast, the long part of the flight shouldn't take more than around 8-10 hours. The people are absolutely wonderful. They're pretty easy to understand in general, and if they know you're struggling, they'll do whatever they can to help. Just make sure to put the effort in to use French, and even if you pronounce things wrong, they'll be thrilled you tried. Some of them even think it's cute when Americans pronounce it wrong. As far as wardrobe goes, just stay away from wearing clothing with writing on it, I recommend wearing either solid colors or some kind of a cute print. Nothing that screams "I'm an American" like the US flag, Hannah Montana, or High School Musical. I usually just wear nice jeans and a fairly nice top. This time of year it can get pretty chilly, so make sure you check the weather before you go and have some sweaters as well as short sleeved things in case it's warm. I know you're traveling with a group, but you will probably still have some time pretty much on your own. Also bring at least one dressy outfit, like a nice skirt or pants and a nice top. You don't have to wear it every day, but it's good to have on hand in case you need it. You may want to pick up a guide book before you go because it may have something in it that you aren't going to cover that you didn't know was there but will really want to see. I highly recommend Frommer's Irreverent Guide to Paris. General necessities to pack...other than the obvious toiletries and clothing, look into getting some travel Space Bags. They work great and make packing a lot less stressful b/c you don't have to worry about not having enough room. Bring some kind of a notebook or a journal with you and at the end of the day write down what you did and saw. It's easy to forget the little things after you get back, and it always makes me smile to look in my notebook and find something cool I forgot happened. Don't forget stuff to keep you amused in the flights and airports. I usually bring a novel or two, music, and word puzzles/sudoku/etc. A mini first aid kit can be extremely useful-bandaids, aspirin, the pill form of Pepto Bismol, safety pins, and anything else you might need. If you take medications, make sure to put them in your carry on in case your suitcase gets lost. It doesn't happen often, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Keep a copy of your passport in your luggage so if something happens to your passport, you at least have photocopied backup when you go to the Embassy. Always have more batteries than you think you'll need for your camera. It would be a nightmare getting halfway through the trip and having your last set of batteries go dead. Take some kind of small battery powered alarm clock because not all European hotel rooms have alarms to wake you up or even clocks at all. This will sound a little crazy, but if you want to have a washcloth, pack a couple. I've been in some hotels that have them, but most don't. If you haven't seen it already, try to watch the movie Amelie before you go. It's fabulous and will really get you in the mood for Paris. If you want or need more advice, email or im me and I'll be happy to help, including if you are an Amelie fan, where and how to find places from the movie. <br>  <br>  *VERY IMPORTANT* Find extremely comfy shoes. Even with the fantastic Metro system, you will still end up doing a ton of walking, and even with comfy shoes, your feet will probably still hurt by the end of the day.<br>  <br>  Sorry this was so long, I just wanted to be thorough. Enjoy your trip!!|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	With the exchange rate things will cost you at least 30% more.<br>  <br>  It's about an 8 hour plane ride.<br>  <br>  If you make the effort to talk to them in French, even if you aren't good at it, they will talk to you in English. Most people in Paris speak English but they will be more receptive if you make the effort first.<br>  <br>  People in Paris dress about the same as people in America. Some are elaborate but most dress casual.<br>  <br>  If you are taking along electronics be sure you get a European adaptor before you go. And get some kind of wearable stash for your passport like an ankle strap or a pouch that goes under your shirt, you should be able to find one on line.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Paris is quite expensive. The dollar is not holding too well against the Euro. That may have slightly changed since I went a year ago. Food is pretty pricey at restaurants. Try not to blow all your money on family and friend gifts. If your looking for gifts try to get small things so you can save your money for real experiences. From New York City the plane flight is 8 hours so your trip is roughly the same. Understanding French conversation is difficult because they speak french. I would explain to them that you speak "un peu francais" and that you are American so that they can speak slower. Sometimes it's easy to understand basic things like Bonjour, Bonsoir, Ca va...but conversations are hard. Not everyone there dresses fancy. I saw a lot of blue jeans, slacks, etc. I think the whole French fashion thing is overrated because I never saw outfits over there that knocked my socks off. Necessities: Camera (Photos last a lifetime), extra photo in case passport goes missing (trust me it happens), perhaps a credit card with  a set limit for emergencies, sneakers, book or music for plane. Have fun...trip of a lifetime. <br>  <br>  If you want to use certain electronics (hair dryer, computer, chargers) you must bring an Adapter which you can buy at Radio Shack.

824Md65waa	At first glance it may seem a bit dingy and run down in parts, but it has it's own unique appeal, flavor and culture.  The French Quarter is always bustling with people, especially on Bourbon St and around Jackson Square.  Bourbon Street is a mecca of dive bars, live music, strip clubs, and drunk people (you can walk around with open containers of alcohol so think yard glasses full of beer or daiquiri).  Closer to Jackson Square you are more likely to find a variety of bars/restaurants, street vendors and shops.  Away from the French Quarter you can pick up the St. Charles Street car and head uptown through the Garden District.  In this area St. Charles Street is lined with beautiful, fancy homes.  Another cool feature of the city are the cemeteries, which are all above ground due to the city being below sea level, flooding, etc.  The jazz is great and so is the cajun, creole food.  Like all southern states you get that vibe of southern hospitality and the city's overall pace is of course much slower than that of NYC.|`|W76VDFKCaa	New Orleans, also known as the Crescent City, the Big Easy, or NOLA, is a very unique city because of it's historical and multicultural heritage. NO is one of the oldest cities in America and has deep roots from French, Spanish, and African culture. It is the birthplace of jazz and is highly known for its cuisine.  NO is also known for Bourbon St., the French Quarter, street cars, St. Louis Cathedral (the oldest, active cathedral in the US), Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, Essence Festival,  shotgun houses, above ground cemeteries, etc.  Some famous people from NO: Anne Rice, Tyler Perry, Chris Owens, Al Copeland (founder of Popeyes), Ellen Degeneres, Richard Simmons, Reese Witherspoon, Harry Connick, Jr., and Eli & Peyton Manning.|`|paHjJrrdaa	I live here and its great.

fmQIU0zqaa	It depends what you are traveling for. If you're traveling for a historical kind of trip, than I would say Europe. If you're going to be traveling to have a fun time, Australia. But both places are amazing to visit!<br>  <br>  Just remember if you choose Australia, be prepared for the longest flight of your life. I think it takes almost an entire day to arrive there. So, bring lots of stuff to do on the plane!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|XTmiI44laa	Not sure where you live, I have been to both and by far I would say Australia<br>  <br>  If you are an American you will have people in Europe being rude to you and don't expect any smiles.<br>  <br>  Choose Australia everytime, best time to travel from the U.S. is latter part November when fares are a little cheaper.<br>  This is their spring and is not too hot.|`|aMN30gyXaa	It depends what you want to do. <br>  Ive been to both places. Europe has many historical sites that are very beautiful and many interesting art museums etc. But if you dont speak the language it can be difficult.

ZxYxB9jCaa	Life isn't supposed to be fair...sometimes we feel as though we are being treated unfairly, that we are not given what we deserve or what we truly desire...however, there may be struggles at one moment, but then in the next, we will be rewarded...nobody's life if perfect forever, just like nobody's life is hard forever...people take turns in life...for instance, you see so many people who grow up in horrible areas with very little family, material things, comfort, etc., but when they grow up, they become successful adults with a huge family and a comfortable life...there is this "seesaw" effect in life...but in the end, everyone gets what they were meant to get...sure sometimes people may wish that they had a big family or family that they actually got along with, but in the end there is nothing that they can do about it...sure it may make you sad, but you have to remember that you want to enjoy what you have, and not spend your time feeling sad or miserable...ENJOY life...there are so many things out there for you to go find...you have to believe that everything is the way it was meant to be...even though it may seem hard to believe at times :)|`|s02JBtvDaa	Allah has divide everything among us .. he gave some ppl Money and bad health or bad family ..

NMcFF0Iwaa	Wendy, this is for you:<br>  Miss USA is Crystle Stewart<br>  Miss America is Katie Stam<br>  Remember, when you call people names you are really referring to yourself. <br>  <br>  To answer the question:  Miss USA.|`|TjEsdpX1aa	they are the same dumba-s-s|`|fcdZoH72aa	This depends on your definition of bigger.<br>  <br>  I definately think more people compete in and watch Miss USA. Miss USA is broadcasted on NBC so naturally it has a larger audience. Traditionally, the USA girls have more success in the entertainment industry and are more well-known after they compete and they use it as a way to get into acting and modeling. Miss USA is owned by Donald Trump so there are a lot more resources for promotion and more exciting appearances.<br>  <br>  Over the years, the audience and contestant numbers for Miss America have declined. The pageant is no longer televised on network television, it's now on cable. Miss America has had some difficulty with relevancy lately, but it does remain an American institution and a very recognizable brand.<br>  <br>  So while I think more people are aware of Miss America, Miss USA seems to be dominating the industry.|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	I think the Miss American pageant is bigger here.

Beach on the red sea is well built and perhaps the biggest beach in the world. You will find multicultural and multinational workforce from all around the world. All types of foods widely available at affordable prices. Wahhabi's widely practiced throughout the Kingdom. Embassy City in Riyadh, however, some consulate still working to issue visa to the public and expatriate both for business and pleasure trips. In one hour time you can reach the Holy city of Makkah while travel to Medina takes 4 hours by car and 50 min by aircraft. Medina people are very very nice and polite to deal, on the other hand people from Markka are little bit harsh in dealing. The country rules doesn't allow you to apply for immigration, however, you will be living in Saudi Arabia under the sponsorship of a Saudi, who will acquire a residence and well as work permit. Such work permits are valid for 2 years time and further renewable subject to willingness of your sponsor. You will be given an exit / re-entry visa to travel out of kingdom and back in to the kingdom. The cost of such visa is 200 Saudi Riyals.|`|dd3gCaNHaa	i'm a saudi from jeddah, in terms of friendly people...jeddah would be the best. there's a great mix of races that form the jeddawi society...that goes of course to Mecca and Medina as well due to pilgrims from around the world settling there. the holy cities are great for islamic education however, jeddah is better for living because it combines great businesses, more job and career opportunities,lots of recreation, the sea of course, more metropolitan as well as ease of access to mecca and medinah (less than an hour drive to mecca and about 3 hours to medinah) lots of jeddawis go for umrah or visit medinah on weekends. i know about a dozen girls who live in mecca and come to jeddah everyday to attend university and the other way round.<br>  we don't discriminate, some people may be a bit nosy and would ask too many questions about how you converted, why, when and why you decided to migrate...some would be suspicious of you and your intentions even...that's normal, we sometimes get over protective of our space...but once you're in..you're in. saudis in general are warm, loyal and very generous with their time, energy, advice and even resources. being their friend is being family...and nothing is more important to saudis than family. <br>  you can refer to my other answers about life in saudi and jeddah when you click my name...hope you find it helpful, and welcome to saudi.|`|WIEH455laa	Well brother welcome to Saudi! There are actually thousands of expats living Saudi, most are not Muslim. There is little to NO racism is Saudi, at least not to your face. <br>  <br>  There is a large community of American-Muslims in Riyadh. There are more jobs in Jeddah and Riyadh in general.

I hope you will educate yourself about the origin of the word and how it came into use.  Saudis don't call themselves wahabi.  Enemies of Islam call saudis wahhabis.  If you want a better term, maybe Salafi, although I'm not one who likes to put a label on my Islam.  I am a Muslim who follows Quran and Sunnah.  I don't need to label myself.<br>  Study in Madinah first, and then decide where you want to live.  I'm sure you can study Islam in Madinah, Makkah, Riyadh, and Al Qasim.  I'm not sure about where the other Islamic Universities are here.<br>  <br>  Brother, what I think is that when you call yourself wahhabi, you give people the idea that you only follow the teachings of abdul-wahab, which I'm sure isn't your case, but that's what people think.  Why do we call our religion Islam rather than Muhammadism?  because we worship Allah, not Muhammad.  <br>  <a href="http://islamqa.com/en/ref/12203/" rel="nofollow">http://islamqa.com/en/ref/12203/</a> - as you can see from this article, wahabi is generally used in a negative way.  I personally don't want to go around calling myself wahabi.  I have read the book of tawheed written by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Al-Wahhaab.  He took all of his knowledge from Quran and Sunnah, so there's no such thing as wahabi.  You follow Quran and Sunnah.....

I go because it is close and it is not an expensive tourist trap like the ski resort towns that also have pine trees and mountains. The views in Glacier Park are breathtaking, the freshness of the air is the best on earth, and everyone seems to be in a good mood while there. The hotel prices are a decent price,or you can camp with a trailer or tent if you reserve a spot a little bit in advance. It's a big area. There are quite a few towns in Glacier Park. It takes up about 1/4th of the state area.

AA10740352	My suggestion to you is book a cruise on Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas.  Its a fabulous ship with lots of great features and activities including a rock climbing wall, an ice skating rink, an in-line roller skating track, a mini-golf course and a basketball court. <br>  <br>  This ship just moved from Florida to California to do the Mexican Riviera cruises.  WE cruised on it a year ago from Florida to the Caribbean and I can tell you that you will enjoy the ship and the cruise.  There are a number of great deals on the ship.  Take a look at all of the cruise dates on this web page:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.royalcaribbean.com/findacruise/cruiseDetails/itineraryAndPricing.do;jsessionid=0000m6zIeejIfxyH_xbydOK-qyN:12hdhu6tq?packageCode=MA07X006&date=ANY&selectedCurrencyCode=&promoType=&hasSenior=&hasMilitary=&state=" rel="nofollow">http://www.royalcaribbean.com/findacruis...</a> <br>  <br>  Some of the best deals are in April and May and then again at the end of August.  If you want to go for less just go when the price is cheapest.  The cruise makes three great port stops that you will enjoy.  We went to all three on our Mexico cruise and they were great.  I loved Cabo best of all.|`|AA12199774	carnivalcruise.com  is where I book all of mine|`|fL8CIA2Xaa	cruisesonly.com
EaurpLufaa	Uzbekistan is located at the very heart of Central Asia. In ancient times, it was a key link on the Silk Road connecting China with Western Europe.  The legendary cities of Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva were powerful states, important trade centers where architecture and the arts were highly developed.<br>  <br>  Uzbekistan's golden age was under Tamerlaine in the 14th century AD.  Ruling an empire stretching from Turkey to China, he made Samarkand his capital and left a breathtaking architectural legacy including mosques, madrassahs and majestic Registan Square.<br>  <br>  Today, the old atmosphere of the Silk Road still survives in the oriental bazaars and tea houses where the many nationalities of Central Asia gather together wearing their traditional and colorful clothes.

Get one of the bungalows in the back with the nice jacuzzi tub (big enough for two- wink wink, nudge nudge).<br>  Carpinteria is a really cool little beach town. You can walk around and explore it, or drive 10 miles up to Santa Barbara if you like things a little more exciting.<br>  <br>  Cheaper: Holiday Inn Express Carpinteria- A bit nicer than average, with free continental breakfast.<br>  <br>  Cheapest: Motel 6 Carpenteria South- Clean & Comfortable, the basics.|`|AA10169678	I don't know what you mean by "inexpensive", but there are a couple of motels in Carpinteria that are cheaper than $100/night and that's about the best you will do near Santa Barbara. Carp is a cute town and has lots of good restaurants and a nice beach. If you want night life, SB is only about 12 miles up 101.<br>  You can try Ojai, too, but it costs about the same as SB.

I went to Disney a few weeks ago and it was about 59 degrees the second day and 72 the next day. So for clothing, pack a jacket, a rain coat in case it rains, a sweatshirt, and also regular summer clothes.|`|Xds8PTcOaa	April's personally my favorite time of year here. It's not quite into the insufferably hot season, and not yet too humid. As you're from Ireland, and not accostomed to the incredible wetness/suffocating heat, you'd probably do best to pack shorts and tanktops, and maybe a light jacket, just in case!
LrvcJjUXaa	The F1 Savannah cat is legal in almost all states and requires no special permits. <br>  The F1 on down is legal in most states as a pet cat or kitten and no permit is needed. <br>  The serval is restricted. Although in most states people can have servals as pets but you need to check locally if a permit is required. I do know of some countries within states that have restrictive laws and yearly requirements.

sa8dElLZaa	The culture and traditions of Laos<br>  <br>  Sabaidee!<br>  <br>  That means "Hello" in Laos. Welcome to one of the friendliest countries on the planet. These 10 suggestions will help you enjoy your visit, while helping us preserve our culture and traditions.<br>  <br>  1   <br>  Temples are beautiful and interesting, but most of all, they are holy places. Please visit, but dress appropriately, covering shoulders, knees, and everything in between. (Yes, that stomach too!) Whether in a temple or on the street, women who wear a traditional sihn (long skirt) will find the gesture much appreciated.<br>  <br>  2<br>  In Buddhist cultures, the head is high, and the feet are low. Use your feet only for walking. (Okay, we'll make an exception if you're a kick-boxer!) Pointing your feet at someone – for example, by putting your feet up on a stool – is rude. So is stepping over someone seated on the floor.<br>  <br>  3   <br>  Fewer local people give alms in the morning than in the past. Cameras flash in their faces at a time when they only wanted to quietly practice their faith. Any time you see our culture hurt by a thoughtless individual, please speak up. If you wish to participate in giving alms, by all means do so, but don't just get up early and buy some rice from a street vendor. First, please learn about this ancient tradition. Information is posted in many temples, and at Big Brother Mouse.<br>  <br>  4<br>  Please be thoughtful about your generosity. Giving away candy or money discourages initiative, rots teeth, and encourages begging. Medical supplies are easily misused; a donation to the Lao Red Cross is more likely to achieve your goals. Books, pens, and educational supplies are greatly needed; it's best to give them to a school, a teacher, a library, or village elders.<br>  <br>  5   <br>  We believe that kissing, holding hands, and other displays of affection with the opposite sex are private acts that should be done in private.<br>  <br>  6<br>  Our country is different from yours! That's why you're here, right? We have many different customs and ways of doing things. When something doesn't go as expected, everybody loses face if you lose your temper. Stay calm, don't raise your voice, and we'll work things out. That's the Lao way. Instead of getting frustrated at differences, use them as an opportunity to think about why customs might have evolved differently here than in your country. <br>  <br>  7   <br>  Lao people are modest, and it's uncomfortable to see people who are not. Nude bathing at the waterfall, in the river, or while rafting, is never appropriate. Lao women wear a t-shirt and shorts covering from mid-thigh to shoulders; for men, shorts are fine. When in Laos, we hope you'll do the same. <br>  <br>  8<br>  Please help us build a stronger country, while maintaining our heritage. Don't buy old objects as souvenirs; they were probably stolen from unprotected temples or historic sites. You can support talented and hard-working local artisans by purchasing new and beautiful weavings, silverwork, and handicrafts. Each time you give someone money, think about what type of behavior you are rewarding. When you buy drugs, antique Buddhas, or wildlife products, you're encouraging behavior that hurts the people of Laos.<br>  <br>  9   <br>  We need your help to preserve our traditions. If you see someone acting or dressing inappropriately, please talk to them, or pass along this brochure. If your guide allows such behavior, please talk to him or her about it.<br>  <br>  10<br>  For thousands of years, we've been developing our culture. This is only one sheet of paper; it can't explain everything! After you've been here a day, why not re-read what your guidebook says about local customs? You'll understand more after you've spent a little time here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigbrothermouse.com/laos/laos_culture.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigbrothermouse.com/laos/laos...</a>
AA11103188	I was on the ship in Sept 08 and had such a wonderful time.  The cruise was well priced and feel I got my money's worth.  I did not go to the dinner club because I felt I did not need to.  The food was excellent, and always available.  Room service was great, buffet, dining room,   awesome service too.  As far as the rest, we played mini golf, layed in the sun, participated in activities, shopped a little and went to the casino.  I did spend some money there!  We explored the various bars and clubs on the ship and spent time at the cafe(really awesome chocolate cake!!)  Watched the shows and we did karaoke that was fun!  The only bad thing(which actually was a good thing in the end) is that there really is not a floor where you can go from 1 end of the ship to the other.  But we used the stairs alot so we were able to lose a few lbs!!  <br>  <br>  if you want check out my review on Cruise Critic..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/memberreviews/memberreview.cfm?EntryID=46960" rel="nofollow">http://www.cruisecritic.com/memberreview...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you have fun!!|`|86PWsHmwaa	Carnival Valor was by far my favorite ship so far, ive also been on Carnival Fantasy and in May 2010 i am trying Carnival Pride..carnival valor is a very nice ship, has everything you need without overdoing it. Thats half the reason i wouldnt like royal caribbean i know some people would like having all those nice things to do, but im one to just lay by the pool and EAT, esp. on cruises. They have a very nice dining room, shows, etc. There is a waterslide, 2 pools, and 4 hot tubs. their gym is VERY nice, overlooking the sea on the front of the ship..Food is tremendous! After all thats one of the best things about a cruise. There is pizza 24/7 and ice cream also. Very nice ship!

eD7qRBKHaa	Yes, this rumor has been floating around for years and it changes a little from time to time.  You never know with Disney, but what you can depend on is that it is just a rumor until Disney announces it!  They have never closed other parks before while building new parks, so if they did, the other parks would run as normal.<br>  <br>  Right now they are sinking lots of money into re-doing California Adventure, so I don't see them trying to build a new park until they get done with that.|`|rSq790ksaa	As of right now, it's not going to happen. There have been plans for years for Disney to build a 5th park called "Beastly Kingdom." It would only open at night and supposedly cost extra than the other parks to get into. They were also saying that only a certain number of people could enter per. night. <br>  <br>  The pictures made it look like a mixture of Animal Kingdom and Downtown Disney. It was very strange. However, these are only rumors at this point and if Disney was to build another park, they wouldn't do it right now.|`|x9RDPwIZaa	Harry Potter's Wizarding World might be what you are thinking of for a 2010 opening.  It's a land at *Universal*. <br>  <br>  Disney has the room to build another park if they choose, but I wouldn't count on it starting any time soon.  After it starts--if it starts--it will take more than a year, probably several.<br>  <br>  As far as Beastly Kingdom goes...That has been a rumored land in Animal Kingdom since before Animal Kingdom opened.  It is supposed to be centered around mystical creatures.  If you look over one of the bridges, you can see where it was planned.  However, things are shelved for a reason.  If they do open another land in Animal Kingdom, except something different.<br>  <br>  Now, Night Kingdom...That was a rumor Disney played with briefly.  It was meant to be a type of after parks activity sort of along the lines of Pleasure Island, but mixed with Animal Kingdom.  It was going to be horribly expensive ticket (special ticket like Pleasure Island once upon a time) and have limited issue.  It died, too, for a reason.  It was dreamed up to try and keep people away from Universal's Harry Potter attractions.|`|zyUfLvF5aa	I have heard many rumors about a fifth park that would be called Night Kingdom. It sounded like it was not going to happen, but you never know. They would not need to close the rest of Disney World to build this, just like they don't close a park to build a ride. The park would take years to build, so we wouldn't know much about it for sure until 2010, which like you said, is when they are starting the building, that is, if the rumor is true.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	there are rumors that a 5th park will be built at disney world. the rumored name is "night kingdom". the park will have mainly thrill rides in it. <br>  i've heard that they want to open it in 2011 for the 40th anniversary of magic kingdoms opening day (october 1, 1971)<br>  <br>  no they would not close any of the disney world parks while building the new one.<br>  the parks would be open as usual. lt|`|AA10183247	The latest information is that it will actually be called "Disney’s Jungle Trek", instead of "Disney’s Night Kingdom".

rIzx4OEWaa	I used to work on cruise liners for a few years an it is how I met my wife.<br>  Ships officers will sit at different dinner tables during the cruise an the standard of dress is casual.<br>  For captains cocktails some people wear dinner suits like white tuxedo's or a normal DJ.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	Most cruise ships have at least one "Captain's dinner" in a week's cruise. It means there will be pre-dinner cocktails, and as you enter the lounge, you will shake hands with the Captain and have your photograph taken with him. They hope you'll buy the photos later! When that's done, the Captain makes a short speech from stage and introduces some of his officers, then you go to dinner.<br>  Unless you're one of the chosen few, you won't actually sit at table with the Captain.|`|AA10740352	I have been on more than 20 cruises with several cruise lines and here's what to expect.  When you go on a cruise there will be formal nights when guests are REQUESTED to wear formal attire and that can be anything (for men) from a suit of any color to a tuxedo. The key is that attire is what they request that you wear and there is no penalty on you if you decide to just go sports casual (shirt with a collar and slacks). They will not deny you access to the dining room, or the show room, or any place else..  There is generally a reception in one of the big ship's lounges and they serve free drinks and maybe Hor'douves.  The ship's captain and several of the top crew members, including the cruise director, will usually be present to greet you and in most cases you can also have a photo taken with the captain (which you have to purchase).<br>  <br>  Many people have the mistaken belief that the captain's dinner will be special and personal for them. In reality on formal nights about 10 people get invited to sit with the captain at his(her) table and the rest of the people do not even know if or that the captain is in the dining room unless their table is near the captain's table. So unless you have a personal invitation to actually sit at the captain's table dress as you please.  If you do get that invite to the captain's table, go formal for sure, and as formal as you can.<br>  <br>  An invite is very rare as I have been on more than 20 cruises and had my first invite on our last cruise in February.  However, the Director of Human Resources represented the Captain and he was not present.|`|a3e3509ad338f6ad944305dbb4159711aa	When I worked onboard cruise ships, I had to go for Dinner with guests 2 to 3 times in a 7 day cruise. <br>  <br>  And also the other officers had to host tables. Yet that was on far smaller ships than what is out there by now. <br>  I do believe that the Queen Mary 2 is better in that than some other ships and has more officers in the Dining Room and during the Captains welcome party. <br>  <br>  Just go with the flow and enjoy your cruise.|`|OLeYNeCFaa	Don't forget that u will be going on a Cunard ship, if it's a formal night u have to dress formal after 6pm. Hosting tables for Officers happens only on formal nights. Everybody else will dress formal, you will only find yourself out of place if you don't.<br>  <br>  On average on a 7 days cruise there are 3/4 formal evenings, but you will receive all the instruction with your ticket well in advance.<br>  <br>  Happy cruising!|`|jipqICzVaa	We had the First Engineer on our table on the P&O Aurora. He was hysterical. The stories he told were soooo funny. He told us about burying people at sea. How when you sew up the shroud the last stitch goes through the nose, so if they aren't dead they scream. Don't know how true that is, but we believed it. They are used to "entertaining"  so you'll have a great time.<br>  <br>  On the P&O ships, they send a newsletter around to tell you what to wear each night (formal, smart casual, casual, fancy dress) The formal wear is dinner suits and evening dresses, or you don't go in the dining room. Some of the bars and lounges also insisted on formal wear on that particular night. Thomson is more easy going. Dinner suits are optional, although they expect shirts and ties those nights.|`|AA11579568	They say it's formal attire, but I thought it was more semi formal.

In East Turkestan, school instruction is in Chinese and very few pieces of literature are published in Uyghur or other Turkic languages. <br>  <br>  The Chinese government gives economic incentives for Han Chinese to move to East Turkestan. In 1949, 75% of East Turkestan was Uyghur. By 2008, this percentage dropped to 29%.<br>  <br>  We are being forced to become second class citizens in our own homeland.<br>  <br>  We Uyghurs face religious persecution and discrimination at the hands of the Chinese authorities. <br>  <br>  Uyghurs who choose to practice their faith can only use a state-approved version of the Koran; <br>  <br>  Men who work in the state sector cannot wear beards and women cannot wear headscarves.<br>  <br>  The Chinese state controls the management of all mosques, which  stifles religious traditions that have formed a crucial part of the Uyghur identity for centuries. <br>  <br>  Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to attend mosque. <br>  <br>  Religious figures may not hold high-level state positions or be school teachers. Some parts of Xinjiang has been used for nuclear testing, which as a result have killed many turks. <br>  <br>  A large number of individuals have been arrested by the government as political dissidents and that a large number have been executed.<br>  <br>  Chinese are robbing us of all natural resources and we have been forced to become a second class citizen on our own homeland.<br>  <br>  Ever since 9/11 they have conveniently branded us as Muslim terrorists to the world body and continued their repression.<br>  <br>  I request freedom minded people to support our cause<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/UyghurResearch.asp?mid=-1723487515&mid2=1892514197&mid3=824585852" rel="nofollow">http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/UyghurR...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uyghuramerican.org/forum/showthread.php?t=9848" rel="nofollow">http://www.uyghuramerican.org/forum/show...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjHXz2Vm5Yg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjHXz2Vm5...</a>
4zIJ6I9Uaa	First have a look at this blog, im a cabbie and i got most of my info from the guy who runs this website, he posts on taxi driver online forums his address is: <a href="http://www.becomeataxidriver.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.becomeataxidriver.org.uk/</a> Below is an email he sent me.<br>  <br>  In cab driving there are a lot of variations in pay and conditions. Even variations in operating costs. The first port of call is always the licensing authority (aka your local council). Call their general number (see yellow pages) and ask for the licensing department, they will give you all the advice you need. <br>  <br>  You are probably surrounded by several LA’s depending on where you are in the country and how big your area is. LA’s can run taxi services in very different ways; So this subject should be your first port of call when doing your research. It may benefit you to work outside the council you live in (although some councils don’t allow this). Average time to get your licence is 5-8 weeks, up to 3 years for London hackney drivers. I will go more into detail on how different LA’s work and how you can capitalise on those differences in my next blog.<br>  <br>  Your local council, also called licensing authority are the ones who will test you, check you and police you (and annoy the hell out of you at times). They give you your plate (if you are private hire) and badge and ultimately your right to work as a taxi driver. <br>   As I have said; every Licensing authority works in a different way and the best place to find out how they work is the your local councils website. If you don’t know the web address of your licensing authority you can google it or click the link for a list of all the councils in the UK: <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/Localcouncils/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Director...</a><br>  <br>  I will run through the basics requirements of your average council. <br>  ? Minimum age 21<br>  ? Licence held for at least 12 months<br>  ? MOT – This is normally an MOT specific to Taxis and can be every 6 months in some areas. If you plan on renting time on a hackney cab the owner should look after the MOT.<br>  ? Passport or other ID<br>  ? Drivers Licence – Got points? I will cover this in another post.<br>  ? CRB Check (Criminal records Bureau) I will cover this more in future blogs, especially for prospective drivers that have a record for whatever reason.<br>  ? Medical – The council will give you a list of doctors approved for doing these checks when you apply. (Again more on this in future blogs for drivers with medical conditions and those who don’t want to be shafted by some greedy doctors charging extortionate fees.<br>  ? Fees, Fees, Fees!!! For all of the above, everyone will charge you for everything but that’s just the way it goes.<br>  <br>  Here are some other requirements more and more councils are introducing:<br>  ? Street knowledge test<br>  ? DVLA Mandate check<br>  ? Driving Test<br>  ? Being able to break dance. (only kidding).<br>  As a Guide: Here is a list of fees for Hackney and Private Hire drivers in my area (Liverpool).<br>  ? Hackney carriage vehicle licence renewal: ￡120<br>  ? Private hire vehicle licence with plate: ￡130<br>  ? Street knowledge test booking fee: ￡20<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|dWjANfQXaa	Medical, police check and apply at your local council office for a permit. See if any local companies need any drivers, if so they may help you with the licence process.|`|1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	what type of cabbie do you want to be? white cab or hackney carriage??<br>  my bf got his hackney carriage license last year. <br>  first step is to get a vehicle. its better if its brand new as they will pass the mot tests etc without problems. basically if there is anything slightly wrong, it wont pass as a passenger vehicle. <br>  next you must get a full medical. <br>  next step is to apply for your liscence. you do this thru the dvla. then you must register with your council to get your plates. u must have a clean liscence to get a taxi liscence. any points and your out. <br>  there is a fee for the liscence and also there will be a fee for your plates (cant give you a price as it depends on the area you wish to work... the bigger the city, the more it costs). if you are in a big city like london or cardiff etc you will have to sit a test with the dvla.... basically a map test to proove you know the area well enough. if your working a small town area u dont need to take the test. <br>  i forgot to mention, u will need to provide your council with an up to date, recent criminal records check on yourself. this costs between ￡50- ￡100 and can take 6 weeks to get back. <br>  you will need to regularly get your taxi seviced and will need to change the tyres around every 2 months (depending of coarse on your milage). <br>  and you need to get the relevent insurance on your vehicle. <br>  <br>  once all is done, apply to your council for some contracts... ie, daily school runs and or hopital trips. they are difficult to get these days, but will become your main source of income (unless u intend to be out late every night working) <br>  <br>  good luck... i hope this info was of some use to you|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	first you need to get in touch with the licensing department of your county council and ask them for an application pack for a hackney carriage driving license. when you have that,you have to fill out a request form for a CRB check to be carried out. while that is being processed, make an appointment for your medical with your local doctor.all in all this costs around ￡200 because you have to pay for your crb, medical and if you are fit to become a driver you will have to pay the council for your badge, which needs re-newing annually. good luck with your venture.
CuYQ57mjaa	More than a century later after Rizal's death , our national hero is considered and called by Spanish as "Hijo de Espana Madre".   A Rizal statue was built in Madrid.  <br>  <br>  It will be a welcoming gesture of the government of Spain to waive and implement a "No Visa requirement for the citizens of Philippines" to come for a tour, business or official visit.  Actually, citizens of Spain can come with no visa requirement for at least 21 days visit in the Philippines.  Returning such diplomatic favor could develop a renewed ties and deeper relationship among the citizens of both countries.|`|eDjiOWKtaa	Filipinos aren't in any way Hispanic so there's no need to be welcomed as Hispanic.<br>  <br>  it's always been either Castillian-Spanish, Chinese, or Malay. but if you insist, you can stop drinking Corona and start drinking San Miguel.|`|bhc7HuN9aa	Filipinos aren't hispanics, just because Spain ruled here doesn't mean a damn thing.<br>  They are more USA than anything.|`|4e18c82089d9eecf334053f6edf2d156aa	learn tagalog.|`|kSt1BI6vaa	Stop claiming the California Grape Strike as entirely your own?|`|AA10690200	eat balut!!!<br>  <br>  BTW, I don't think they want to be welcomed as Hispanics... they may get deported!!

kgBPU4xxaa	You do not want Eurail passes for the trip you are proposing. Individual tickets will be cheaper. You may not qualify for a Eurail pass anyway if you have been living in Germany for at least 6 months, you would get an InterRail pass rather than Eurail. However, if you're a resident of Italy at the time you travel, you cannot use the InterRail pass on Italian trains. With the pass, you would need to pay an extra supplement/reservation for the higher speed trains here (any train other than the regional ones). <br>  <br>  The Trenitalia travel cards for the trains are good for unlimited travel for a month on a particular route and type of train - it's not unlimited travel on all trains and will cost much more than individual tickets since there's only a discount of 5% over buying a month's worth of individual tickets.<br>  <br>  You can save money (up to 20%) on the Venice to Florence and Pisa to Rome route by purchasing individual tickets in advance at the Amica rate if you use the faster trains. From Florence to Pisa, it's mostly regional trains that are only 5.60 euro (2nd class) anyway. Individual tickets would cost only 65.40 euro per person at the standard fare. If you take advantage of the Amica discount for buying tickets in advance, you can book the same three legs for 53.80 euro. <br>  <br>  Note that if "mid-April" includes the week after Easter, train travel is pretty heavy here in Italy and it's mandatory to have seat reservations on some trains that don't normally require them. It would be a good idea to book tickets early.<br>  <br>  I gather that you're military, so you may be able to get a discount or pass that isn't generally available. You should check with whatever travel support there is at the base. Not all travel agents here are authorized ticket agents for the train system.|`|cZdXcmFlaa	you can just but the tickets when your there really easily they have these machines and they can give instructions in any language and they dispence the tickets , its cheaper also that the 7 day tickets or euro rail , it also means if you decide to stay somewhere longer its not a big deal . <br>  the trains in italy are brilliant enjoy your trip!
VlhmbHGGaa	No need for reasons. Either the ticket is refundable or it is not. It's in the ticket rules. Sadly, cheap tickets are almost always not refundable. Maybe it can be changed to a later date (usually for a fee).<br>  <br>  But the question can only be answered if the specific ticket (fare) rules are known. These rules can be found on sites like www.expertflyer.com but the sites are pay-sites. Calling the airline is free and customer service can check the rules for the specific ticket.|`|AOPuoo16aa	Most likely no. You may be able to use it as credit towards another flight but you will usually have to pay a fee. Your best bet would be to call the airline and ask.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Reasons will not get you a refund.  Either your dad purchased a non-refundable ticket or a refundable ticket.  The airline will not care if you are "graduating before your travel dates."  They will just see if the ticket qualifies for money back.|`|KGUidL4daa	What airline is he flying?
9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	I vote for Louisville, KY as the top choice. It has the Slugger factory tour you can take, see Churchill Downs and go to the museum. Try a mint julep. It is right along the river and has a nice downtown area.<br>  <br>  St. Louis is a good option too to go up the arch, go on the Budweiser tour (free and with samples), riverboat along the Mississippi or go to a riverboat casino.<br>  <br>  Lexington, Ky is another option. Just north in Georgetown, KY is a Toyota factory you can take a tour of. In Lexington there is the Kentucky Horse Park if you are into animals. Lots of bourbon distilleries in the area you can tour.<br>  <br>  Cincinnatti, OH is another option. It has quite a lively downtown on the Ohio/KY border with a lot of nightlife. If you go you must check out Jungle Jims.<br>  <br>  If you love to shop or go to a theme park check out the Mall of America in St. Paul, MN.

VxfyQZ2jaa	I didn't see the film but no - New Orleans does not have storm sirens.  The storm danger for New Orleans is from hurricanes, which usually offer several days warning so sirens are not necessary.<br>  <br>  There used to be Civil Defense sirens scattered around the city, but they were installed during the cold war and were for attack warning, not storms.  They are all gone, and have been for decades.|`|paHjJrrdaa	No they don't! LOL!|`|zgDQrI2uaa	In the 40 years I've lived in and around the city I've never seen or heard any.
9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	What to do - London's theater, excellent museums - especially the British Museum, National Gallery, Victoria and Albert, and Museum of London (history), the Tower of London, the Hampton Court Palace, St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey, walking tours with London Walks.  Some offbeat things that are fun include Sir John Soane's Museum, Vinopolis, and the ethnic neighborhoods of Southall (Indian) and Brixton (Afro-Caribbean).<br>  <br>  What not to do - Crime is not really a worry since the tourist areas of London are very safe.  Avoid taking taxis since the meters shoot up very quickly for even fairly small distances - instead you should get an pass for the Tube (subway) that gives you unlimited train use in the tourist center for the times you're there.

AuvMZYTSaa	Actually, depending on the airline and equipment, not all international flights have bunks/cots.  747's do, but in others they will cordone off a row or two of seats for F/A use.<br>  <br>  Many international flights that originate in the U.S. depart in the evening and as such, most of the passengers will be asleep.  The crew will alternate taking care of the cabin which will be minimal|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	No, but if you notice you won't see some of the crew some of the time. It's because they take turns resting or napping, most large planes have areas that have beds or bunks for crews to rest during long haul flights.

Give it a thought... <br>  And before you start to say that I don′t have any idea about Arab countries and people I want to add that I did work in various Arabic and Middle Eastern countries. I definitely know what I am talking about.<br>  And I did work with Saudi millionaires who come to Costa del Sol in Spain and behave in let′s say a strange way... as well as they do in Agadir for example... but I know that these guys are definitely not representative for all Saudi men...<br>  But apart from this, I would like to say, that it is wrong to judge all people as savages, because common people simply try to make the best out of their situation and unfortunately have to adapt to the laws in their countries. <br>  I mean that most people would prefer to have more liberty and many women would like to dress in a different way and both men and women would probably prefer to have normal social relationships with the opposite gender, but the laws make them small and afraid and they prefer to live a secure life instead of protesting and risking their life standard and private security.<br>  I personally guess that is why the authorities put such savage punishments, because this way people get afraid and think that if it can happen to a 75 years old lady, what would they do with a 30 years old young woman… so people try to protect themselves and protect yourself in that country means to follow the law 100%… <br>  I think that these spiritual government leaders do not really care for the Islam, the Sharia or whatever; all they care and worry about is how to keep them in the power. <br>  And the best way to keep you in the power is ruling over submissive citizens, people who are too afraid to claim personal rights.<br>  I mean, how can anybody defend that the religious police knocks your door and asks for identification… does that mean that even in your house you are not safe? Does this mean that you don′t even have that privacy? <br>  Does this mean that you are even controlled in your house with whom you talk and with who you are? <br>  So does privacy not really exist? Or does it just exist for these people who hold the power or these who are rich millionaires and can pay for having all privacy they want to have?<br>  My sister in law is married with an Iranian and I got shocked how this society works there. And honestly, I think that it is not as serve as Saudi Arabian society and laws… but maybe I am wrong. <br>  I know a friend, who got married with a Saudi man and does not have any complain about her husband and his loyalty or behaviour, but she tried hard to adapt to your laws and rules of your society, but she couldn’t. <br>  I mean we are used to be ourselves, without having to ask for neither permission nor nothing. Now she suddenly found herself in a country where every move was ruled by the law and where a false step means that you loose your face in society and get trouble with the law.<br>  Now they live in Morocco, her husband did this for her because she could not stand living in Saudi Arabia. You see, people are not savage or all men a guys who enjoy mistreating women… some people are stupid and cruel, some are not… most of us are conformists and try to live best possible without problems. <br>  But I would say that in USA people are just the same… because I have met lots of stupid pimps there as well… <br>  One thing to finish that: I don′t think that a country which is led by inhuman laws which are made to oppress its citizens will be prosper forever, because there will come a time when people get fed up and will stand up for their rights. <br>  It always happened and it will happen always.<br>  Women are more and more educated and I am completely sure that the time will come that women even in Saudi Arabia and although laws are against them, will stand up for their rights and fight to get them and they will… I simply guess it needs its time. <br>  Meanwhile we can′t shut up and accept barbaric acts like that…
X6rFPI2laa	The problem with "missing" liquor in checked luggage and with broken bottles is why I no longer purchase alcohol to bring back with me from any trip.  I'm even a bit leery about perfumes, although since they are smaller and generally in really tough bottles in tight cardboard boxes they are a lot less likely to break.  (They're less likely to be "missing" after a flight, too.)  The only way I know of to get bottles of alcohol home safely after a cruise is not to fly.|`|EoEjbKpzaa	Well first of all...all cruise lines are cracking down on people bringing there own alcohol on the cruise ships. (they want you to buy drinks on the boat). All luggage also goes through detectors and searches before arriving at your stateroom, they have released statements that now they have the right to search and OPEN all water bottles, pop bottles, glass bottles, mouthwash bottles that are in luggage to see if they are alcohol. They have the right to now keep you from boarding the ship and kicking you off. I would be very careful....they are cracking down alot.|`|AA10740352	This works for me all the time and I cruise 2 or 3 times a year. I use a couple flasks that are about the size of a pint liquor bottle and I pack them with my toiletries. That so that if they do x-ray the bottles look like any other.  I put each flask in a zip-lock bag to help guard against spillage.  Then instead of buying a fifth, buy a few pint bottles of whatever you drink and pack them in your leather shoes wrapped in a zip lock bag to guard against spillage. Another thing you can do is buy some mini's like the ones they sell on the airlines and pack them all over your luggage, but for sure in your shoes; whatever shoes you take for the formal night.|`|EgfL2c86aa	bubble wrap it.|`|94b8KImYaa	Not really, except you would fill the alcohol into plastic bottles and then put them in your luggage. But of course, if you want to bring someone that nice french cognac and have it in an old sprite bottle - that would not be too great either.

Look up videos on Youtube if you want they really help and are kinda fun to watch (Ha going in Aug). During the drop your heart does not feel like its going to stop, your stomach just kind goes insane and feels like its going to fall out. It's most scary before the drop because your anticipating it, but its trully a fun ride. Don't be scared its so much fun.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	well kinda but thats cuz i get really excited. its scary but not in the way you think. its a fun scary not a i'm going to die scary. <br>  <br>  what happens is you go into the "hollywood tower hotel" and its sorta dark and creepy looking. then you walk into the library and watch a short video of a mock episode of "the twilight zone" the man explains that in the glory days of hollywood in 1939 5 people went into an elevator and disappeared to the twilgight zone. then he tells you that its your turn. you then leave the library and walk through the boiler room to get to the service elevators cuz the guest elevators are out of order at the moment. you then sit down and buckle your seat belt and the doors close. you go up a few floors and witness the 5 people disappearing then the doors close again and you go up a few more floors and the elevator leave the shaft and goes down a hallway and goes into a second shaft and the man tells you you are going to the twilight zone. its pitch black and then you fall a few floors then its random and you keep going up and down an unknown number of times. and at least once you go up to the very top and look out the window and then you picture is taken as you fall. <br>  here is a video of it if you'd like to view it. <br>  pre-show:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAgIkaCNUk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAgIkaCN...</a><br>  <br>  the ride: *note this person had external lights on their camera so it made it seem a little brighter than is actually is when you are on the ride. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZc_0Yx8_YA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZc_0Yx8_...</a><br>  <br>  go on it and have a great time:)|`|rSq790ksaa	No, it doesn't feel like you're heart is going to stop, it makes you feel like you left your stomach at the top of the ride though. <br>  <br>  If you've ever had turbulence on an airplane, it is like that but more calm and not as intense. It's really not as bad as it looks or you think it is and trust me I'm a big baby and I get motion sick and this ride is nothing for me.|`|4a5c54fee393ae7e3c43b29899037c62aa	Nah, I thought it would be scary and it wasn't at all, but I have a very high tolerance for rides so...|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Yes, but its fun.|`|teL6RS9Jaa	I agree with Lilli!  Tower of Terror is basically Splash Mountain drop over and over again.  I love Tower - worked there part time and rode it several times a day.  If you have been on all of the other thrill type rides at Disney World, you can handle Tower.  Don't psych yourself out!|`|prW1i0vzaa	No, my heart doesn't feel like it is going to stop. And, it depends on what you think of scary. Roller coasters never 'scare' me, so I'd have to say 'no' to that one. Though, I do feel as if I have left my stomach at the top of the hotel!|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	It feels like your stomach goes to your head.It depends on the type of person that rides it

(West Palm Beach, Boca raton)  Most of Florida is really HOT and MUGGY in the summer.  So hot you don't want to go outside.  Lots of gang violence in the Miami area, and so many old people live in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area that it's colloquially called "God's waiting  room."  Orlando and the Cape Canaveral area are okay, but extreme northern Florida is mostly the Okeefenokee swamp,and extreme south florida is the Everglades swamp.  The panhandle is nice as are the keys.  Politically the state is very conservative, so if you have liberal views, leave them at home.  Stay away from the beaches of Eastern Florida during spring break.  It's an absolute madhouse and the cops don't have much of a sense of humor.|`|PmIgR6OLaa	It's ah-mazing, you'll love it. What isn't there to love?! Sun sun sun- so you'll get a lovely tan, loads to do, the people are lovely and friendly and loads of disney magic!!! You will love it  you'll never want to leave I have been 10 times and i'm still wanting to go back for more !!<br>  My favourite theme park would have to be magic kingdom just because it's so so magical. But if you a thrill seeker Universal probably has the best rides. The waterparks are fun to chill out in after a busier morning/afternoon and on the water all day you'll get a gorgeous tan/ I'm so jealous you're going and i hope you have a brillian time, which i'm sure you will! The unoffical guides such as fobars are pretty helpful as well available from most book stores, they give you tips on the best days to visit park to avoid cues, best restaurants to head to, best rides for your age and fmaily etcc... i would definitely advise them as we find them really helpful!!<br>  Hae fun :))|`|lpDXCQwoaa	I've been to Florida many times. It's very nice there. You should spend a day or two at Disney, you don't need to get a room just buy some tickets, and you can go spend a day there, go to some beaches.

twCIv1WNaa	Traffic is fairly lite on Sat. mornings . . . if you don't want to be late, add an extra 15 just in case.  Traffic's a little heavier on Sat. evenings but still nothing like rush hour, so you might also add an extra 15 minutes just in case--or more if you'll be in big trouble if you're late.  All it takes is one traffic jam to mess up your schedule.|`|GeVNkQQSaa	Not much traffic at night.  What time you gt homes depends on how far down the Cape you live.

w4sL6EuFaa	Are you from the United States? If so, just go to your doctor's or a clinic and tell them that you're traveling to Belize. They'll tell you if it's a malaria zone. When I went to South America, I got something for malaria that I took every day that only cost $4 for a whole month's worth at Walmart. I'm not sure if you'll be allowed to use it in Belize though because they might be resistent to it. I don't know. But talk to a doctor! My insurrence covered my visit to a travel clinic, I just had to pay for my shots (yellow fever, tetnis booster, something else that I forget) and malaria pills.<br>  <br>  I agree with the person above me that you should definitely wear bug spray and get/use a fine mesh net when you sleep.|`|b653f9e79cd3f6e985dc3afbe09c9b14aa	When   I  first  came  down  to  Central  America   in  93   I  spent  a  fortune   on  a  travel  clinic    in    Miami....  500  bucks   to  make  sure  I  had  all  the  shots  pills  etc.....    after   about  a  year   I  stopped   taking  Malaria   pills     after  finding  out  no  one  else  was  taking  them  ..... they  are  very   cheap  over  the  counter (chloroquine)      and   Medical  care  in  Hospitals  in  Belize  is  free  and   they  have  very  good  British  Doctors,,,,,,,,    Bring  bug  spray......

I just use bug spay and wear loose clothing when outdoors. I also check out my room before sleeping and kill any I see; if the house isn't well screened, I sleep with a mosquito net, or put on bug spray before bed if I'm in a hotel.|`|9L78Treuaa	Check the CDC: Centers for Disease Control and they have a travel page for every country and it's broken down into the parts of the country you will be in.  Then you will need to find a Dr. who will prescribe you what will probably be chloroquine, which is relatively cheap.  Other malaria meds will mess with your head I've heard.  Find a Dr. early because it might take some time.  And you will need to know all the dates you will be gone; you take the meds a week before and a week after leaving and every week or day you are gone.

Let them kill each other in the streets, let them stay in the city.|`|beO40ap7aa	Thats the yo-boys of Baltimore for you, the city in the words of Peter Boyle in Taxi Driver is "F-----n Mau Mau Land". Young Black ghetto youth of East and West Baltimore essentially display all the things one dislikes about Blacks and then some. The police arent any better either, they enforce the laws they can only and dont care about the residents of the city as most are like what are described above. Its not worth it to call the cops, the BPD protects no one and is only there to arrest people, its not a black or white issue describing the cops, they hate anyone in the city and never show up when the good people in the city need them to. Before I left Baltimore, I thought 99% of Black people in America lived on streets like Greenmount Avenue, North Avenue, Edmondson Avenue and so on. Living outside of the city made me see Blacks better because it was only then I realized the majority of Blacks in America aren't every ghetto stereotype to the tenth power. You shouldn't generalize Blacks in America based on Baltimore, believe me in my personal experience they are a more likeable ethnic group but you've got to see them some where outside of Baltimore for this to be true. There are decent Blacks in Baltimore too but you've got to be around them long enough to realize this. If you drive on a street like Federal Street in East Baltimore having never been around a majority Black area before, you will have a very bad impression of Blacks. My point in all this though is if you base every Black person off of what you see in Baltimore, you will see justification in racist people's attitudes towards Blacks. The Black youth of America in general shouldnt be judged by Baltimore though, only the Black youth of America that is incarcerated should be judged by Baltimore.

wQxgnHfMaa	YES!  It happens a lot, and it happens at other schools throughout the nation.  My cousin got into Berkley in California, but he didn't get into USC.<br>  <br>  I agree with one of the other posters.  Because UGA is the large flagship university, it gets more applications than Georgia Tech.  Both have rigid standards, but both have different strengths which curves admission.  What did you check as your intended major on your application?<br>  <br>  Based on the scores and GPA you listed, you could probably get into both schools....but you are relatively marginal compared to the people that will probably get in as first choice.  Extra-curricular activities are nice, but the schools might also consider that since you were so involved in other things you didn't focus on your academics.  It's a double-edged sword.  In your essay and in your interviews, make sure to show how dynamic you really are.|`|TbiSBXclaa	The HOPE Scholarship has made it extremely difficult to get into any state university.  The bar has been set very high based on this program.  There are so many eligible applicants that these schools have the luxury of being able to only accept the very best students. The top 5% get in.  <br>  <br>  UGA is a much bigger school than GT.  It is more popular with the locals because of it's sports teams (SECFootball!!) and it's reputation as a party school.  For most Georgia residents there is only one university in the state.  It's UGA or it's nothing. <br>  <br>  Tech on the other hand has a very rigorous curriculum. It excels in Engineering, Architecture and Sciences. It is one of the best Engineering schools in the Country.  It has a smaller enrollment than UGA. So in reality if all things are equal, it probably is easier to get into Tech. <br>  <br>  Both schools are tough to get into but UGA, based on it's sheer number of applicants, is even tougher to get into.  <br>  <br>  My advise to you is to enroll in another state school if you don't get into Tech. Work hard and get great grades and transfer to Tech in your Junior year. Check out Southern Poly if you want Engineering or Architecture.  Kenessaw State or Georgia State for Pre-Med or Math.<br>  <br>  If you've got a ton of money there is always Emory.|`|wE5JMeesaa	I disagree with the previous answerer.<br>  <br>  UGA is ivory tower.  Some find it especially difficult to get into--graduate studies especially.<br>  <br>  SAT and ACT scores and GPA isn't everything.  A compelling essay and a history of community involvement--not to mention a good last name goes a long way.<br>  <br>  Still, tech is a great school.  Either way, your education will not suffer.|`|0orf8HJIaa	its more the other way around Ga tech is a very rigorous school, where UGA is still hard, but not quite as bad.<br>  <br>  GA tech really likes high math sat scores and AP math classes on their applications

You will probably lose your deposit, but may avoid a fine by being upfront with the leaseholder.  If he can find another renter promptly, you may not suffer consequences, otherwise, breaking your lease may show up on your credit report.  Better to have a polite conversation about it.

Church of England Clergy are registrars in their own right, but if you get married in another religious building, although the religious leader could conduct the ceremony, a civil registrar would have to attend for the legal registration of the marriage.<br>  So you could also have a Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Methodist, Quaker, or Jehovah's Witness wedding, to name a few. There is also the option of a civil wedding, in a Registry Office, a stately home, hotel, castle or other tourist attraction, as long as it is licenced. <br>  There is one other restriction. The ceremony has to take place in the daytime. I can't remember the exact hours offhand, but a wedding out of the required time isn't legal, so you couldn't have an evening wedding.<br>  In certain circumstances you can get a special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury to hold the ceremony in another venue, like a Church that hasn't been licenced, in jail for a prisoner, or the hospital bedside of someone terminally ill.<br>  For more information, look at <a href="http://www.gro.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.gro.gov.uk</a> , then go into marriages.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	That's totally untrue. there are many different denominations or even a regestry office to choose from.|`|885aff72c6cf3893149fe53e105ac0a0aa	no, there are plenty of other religions in England, like Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Greek Orthodox, etc etc, and they have their own churches and wedding ceremonies.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	I married in England many years ago and only had the choice of a church or registry office.The Registry office was very dull .

nxzCseTmaa	As the other answerer has said i think your view of this country is realllllly romantised. Trust me, Ireland isnt what you see on the t.v.<br>  <br>  Unfortunatley we are probably one of the most racist nations in the world. <br>  That is not to say that you wouldnt be welcomed as an American. Yes, there are a lot of closed minded people who would not be so warm toward a foreigner such as yourself....but most people will judge you as a PERSON rather than your nationality. Thats generally the way it works anyway...x)<br>  <br>  Also, to us, you are not 'Irish'. Don't go saying that if you ever come here. Its unbelievably annoying. Okay, you have roots, but believe me, most Irish people are seriously not gonna care.<br>  <br>  I dont think Dublin is too different. Its really very modern and very like any other major city.<br>  <br>  School systems are good. I assume you want to become a Primary school teacher? Well if so, I think you're in for a disappointment here because to become a Primary teacher in Ireland you need to have a very good standard of the Irish language. (And pass a difficult oral exam). So to put it frankly you have no chance of teaching here<br>  <br>  I dont think there much difference between the churches. Contrary to what you may have thought, Ireland isnt a very religious country. Generally people dont practice the faith or attend church.<br>  Although the vast majority of Irish are Catholic, it is generally just 'cos thats what you were born into'. <br>  From what i've seen, America is actually a lot more religious and conservative than Ireland. Of course I cant speak for everyone but....<br>  <br>  No sex before marriage??? HA!....<br>  In America you have 'purity rings' and they teach abstinance in schools....and so on<br>  Thats certainly not heard of here. Unless its some kind of moral code instilled by your parents or something, but most Irish people are having sex well before their wedding night!<br>  <br>  Errr, if you married an Irish person....youd prob fit in with their family just fine (assuming you are a nice person)<br>  Why would an Irish family be any different to any other family?<br>  Unless theyre just a bunch of weirdos...but theres wackos everywhere eh x)<br>  <br>  Let me just emphasize one more time though that if youre looking for the Ireland youve seen in some film....maybe you should take a little holiday first.<br>  I think you might just find thats its a bit grey, a bit boring and a whole lot different than you expected<br>  And judging from the questions you've asked I honestly think youre waaaay out of touch with the reality of Ireland<br>  <br>  Good luck though im not trying to be mean...just honest!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Here's the thing, you have Irish ancestry, but to those of us born and reared in Ireland, you are American. To you it's an ethnic thing, to us it's a nationality. You would be regarded as a tourist, but welcomed anyway. <br>  <br>  Don't refer to it as South Ireland. The name is the Republic of Ireland. <br>  <br>  Catholics schools are schools in name only. Because we now have many children from many other backgrounds, even schools with names like Sisters of Mercy and the Christian Brothers are becoming more and more non-denominational in feel. Education should be secular anyway. <br>  <br>  Who told you Ireland was so Catholic still? Those days are long gone. Many people not only have sex before marriage, they have children before marriage. Cohabitation is very common now. Where did you get your information from? We are in the 21st century, not the middle ages. <br>  <br>  You'd be accepted into an Irish family if you married into one, why wouldn't you be? But I would strongly advise updating your information on Ireland, particularly in relation to marriage, children and religion. <br>  <br>  Come over and visit and see what it's really like. There's some racism here, and prejudice, but only among the ignorant boggers.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	I think you have idealized Ireland a bit. Racism, prejudice, all of that exists in Ireland too. It is in every country really. Irish people are just people. Some are lovely and some are not. Just like anywhere. You really should visit and maybe read up on local events in Irish papers (which can be found online) to get a clearer picture. <br>  <br>  There are lots of Americans who are living with Irish spouses in Ireland and the reverse in the US. They are treated just like anyone else in both places.<br>  <br>  Catholicism is basically the same in both countries<br>  <br>  Ireland overall is much quieter than the US - it depends on what your preferred life style is. <br>  <br>  But visit and see if you like the place. Movies and picture are just that. They are not the whole story.|`|UkaBy2Hyaa	I couldn't agree more with slipstreamer.  I think you have slightly over-romantisied Ireland but it's easy to do, the grass is always greener and all that.<br>  <br>  There is a national school system in the Republic with a few private schools (which still receive state maintenance grants).<br>  Sadly thanks to the recession standards in schools are set to drop (with the government purposefully making the decision to increase class sizes.  That being said the standard of education here is relatively high.<br>  <br>  3.  Sorry no Idea, I'm agnostic and know nothing about the American Catholic church.<br>  <br>  4.  No Irish people are not strict about sex before marriage, it's a fairly liberal country.<br>  <br>  4.  As slipstreamer said it depends entirely on the person, we're not all programmed the same.<br>  <br>  My advise would be to go on www.boards.ie and chat to a few people in Ireland about the topics your interested in and it should give you a feel about what some people are like over here.|`|f9eKUpvVaa	1. People might stare at you a bit because your accent is different but most people will see you as any other person.<br>  <br>  2. Well in the countryside everyone knows everyone. In Dublin & Cork & other cities you probably wouldn't know your next door neighbour because they're Polish. Ireland doesn't have too many big towns and cities but all very close about 5-7 mins apart for villages & 15 mins for a fairly big sized town.<br>  <br>  3. You start off in Primary School there are 8 years to complete here. You won't be allowed to teach here you have to be able to speak Irish & teach it, you also need to be able to teach English, maths, history, geography & science. You will however be able to teach in Secondary school, you have to complete 6 years here(The 4th one is optional). You need to be able to teach at least one subject here.<br>  <br>  4. I'm pretty sure Catholicism is very alike in every country.<br>  <br>  5. We don't really take religion too seriousley here. Lots of people have sex before being married.<br>  <br>  6. I think the family you are marrying into wouldn't care where your from but would have a load of questions to ask about America.(They'd only do this because they'd be interested to hear what life is like there.<br>  <br>  7. Of course I LOVE living in Ireland its my homeland & I often get home sick on holidays. Personally I would never like to live in America everyone here says it looks boring & depressing.

It is super close to the centre (i.e. 20mins from Holborn/New Oxford Street etc) and Farringdon and Turnmills, with great connections and Exmouth Market which is an awesome little street frequented by celebs (Madonna was filming there when I lived in the area). <br>  <br>  In my 2nd year I lived in the East. As you said, it is rather depressing and dull. I lived on an old estate and there were a good number of gangs in the area, even though the area was in E1 and just 10mins walk from the Tower of London/Tower Hill the difference was very noticeable! I paid around ￡100. Still, as dreary as it was, it was relatively safe since it was relatively central  - and also gangs tend to keep violence amongst themselves so I was never really bothered. Moreover, the East is up and coming especially around Brick Lane/Shoreditch so that would be a good option while looking for a place, also because it is close to the City in case you will be working there.<br>  <br>  I now live in Borough, which I absolutely love. I live on an old estate and pay around ￡120, but I'm only 25mins walk from the centre (across the bridge to the Strand), and even closer to the Tate Modern and of course other things on the Southbank like Borough Market and lots of the Southbank's great pubs and restaurants. It is the safest I have ever felt in London! Many of the residents seem to be young urban professionals. Elephant and Castle is also just down the road (15mins) and although it is a bit dreary it has cheap shops and is also where the Ministry of Sound is. <br>  <br>  Camden is the only other area I can think of that is relatively central yet still affordable (i.e. below ￡130 per week for one room in a shared house). I have no experience of living there though, although I have heard there are lots of drug dealers around and if you've ever been to the market on Saturday  - absolutely swarming with tourists - I can imagine you'd get fed up if you lived in the area. Maybe it's better to save Camden for days and nights out, record shopping, and gigs. <br>  <br>  You can of course get cheaper rent but this would probably be out of the centre, and even in zones 2 or 3. I recommend the centre not only because it's much safer, but because if you can find a place that is walking distance to work it would save you a massive amount of money on transport and is great exercise. I walk to school 30mins each way and the journey flies by. Lots of people jog or bike. Transport is getting more and more expensive, and traffic (if you're in a bus) is absolutely infuriating. Moreover, rush hour in the tube is horrendous, whether it's having to wait on the platform for ages because all the trains that come by are too full to get on, or the entire tube station is closed off to let people in at only small groups at a time. <br>  <br>  If you're willing to pay for a Travel Card, relatively good areas a bit further from the centre are places like Hammersmith, Wapping/Canary Wharf or King's Cross. I would stay away from Peckham or Brixton just because I have heard of people being bothered quite a bit there. <br>  <br>  So those are the places I recommend living! As for what to do, Camden is great for indie pubs and gigs, as is Shoreditch (also for the Sunday Upmarket and curry houses). There are quite a few good club/rave venues including Turnmills, Fabric, SeOne and Ministry and you might as well check out the posher clubs in Mayfair at least once (Chinawhite, Mahiki etc). There are also so many museums and landmarks in London that you'd never get bored, including free ones like the Tate Modern, British Museum and Natural History Museum. <a href="http://londonisfree.com" rel="nofollow">http://londonisfree.com</a> is a great guide for what to do!|`|GAbG2IBMaa	in the dumpster, it gives it a good appeal|`|hoqC9kgKaa	south london, or east london docklands|`|3A4wUrxoaa	London is very crowded.

Except the British authorities didn't see it that way - so the 1916 Easter Rising happened against the British, but not successfully for Ireland. Afterwards, under the leadership of Michael Collins, the IRA carried out guerilla war tactics to make the British listen, and they did. A compromise was proposed to give most of the island back to the Irish, and Michael Collins wanted to accept this because he felt it was a step in the right direction, so we got the 26-county Republic and the 6 counties in the North remained part of the UK and still do so to this day. De Valera didn't like this, and started a war against Michael Collins - De Valera leading the Republicans and Collins leading the Free Staters - the new name for the Irish state was Saorstat Eirinn or the Free State of Ireland. Collins was assassinated, many say by De Valera's orders but this has never been proven, but it would not be surprising seeing as the guy was an absolute weasel and De Valera went on to be involved in Irish politics. The IRA eventually went underground.<br>  <br>  During the 1960s and 1970s, the IRA came back in Northern Ireland. At the time this was predominantly a Protestant province, any Catholics living there were very much secondary citizens and suffered discrimination and harassment from the more extremist Protestant forces and even the local police, who may or may not have been working in cahoots with them. Things got so back that the British army was brought in to protect the Catholic community, and they were made welcome by the same community. But something went wrong, someone got trigger-happy and shot the wrong person, and somewhere along the way, wires got crossed and misunderstandings occurred - and suddenly the British army, who had been brought in to protect Catholics, were victimising those very people they were supposed to be protecting. <br>  <br>  At the same time, the IRA were coming back into power, but as a civil rights movement. Again, something happened that the dregs of the community got into power there and turned it ugly. At the start of the Troubles in the 1960s and 1970s the IRA were freedom fighters, but they became extremist and started bombing places in Britain in retaliation for attacks and harassment against the Catholic community in Northern Ireland, attacks and harassment carried out by the now anti-Catholic and anti-nationalist British Army and pro-British unionist extremist paramilitaries. Basically it was an eye for an eye kind of thing. And not good.<br>  <br>  But the IRA wanted to talk, and the political side of it, called Sinn Fein, is led by Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, and during the 1980s and 1990s they were prepared to talk to the other crowd and try and sort this out peacefully - but THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE MEETINGS. This has never been said in the British media, but the Irish television station RTE has footage of Gerry Adams standing outside of Stormont asking to come in to talk to Ian Paisley and the other crowd. He WANTED to get it sorted out, but they wouldn't let him for a very long time, so Sinn Fein quietly and secretly got in touch with the British government directly to explain their case. It was a shock for many that they had been in talks for several years when it was revealed in the early 1990s, it was like 'what else did we not know about?' <br>  <br>  Around this time it seems that the IRA was degfragmenting, the trigger-happy crowd were out doing their thing, while the political guys were trying to talk things out and start up a peace process of some kind. One person who really helped get this on the go was Mo Mowlam, a British woman whose attitude was to roll up her sleeves and take the stance of 'right, I'll get these bloody men to see sense', and she did. She got the Protestant hardliners to let the Sinn Feiners talk it out, got real dialogue going. <br>  <br>  However, when the Omagh bombing happened, it became apparent that McGuinness and Adams did not have control over the entire organisation of the IRA anymore, so we started hearing about the CIRA (continuity IRA) who have continued to cause trouble - basically this crowd don't care about any political ideals, they just want to make noise and upset people. They are drug dealers, kidnappers, bullies - and scum. They are an insult to the memory of Michael Collins and the other people who worked so hard and sacrificed their own lives so that Ireland could be a state in its own right. They should not be associated with any political movement, and they most certainly do NOT represent people of the Republic of Ireland. <br>  <br>  But the thing is, what they are doing now is not helping them, but it is really helping the peace process, because it's making the people who want to leave the past behind even more determined to beat them. <br>  <br>  Hope this hel|`|O5Sj1aSHaa	its about weapons, drugs and money and someone has put the spanner in the works

I personally prefer the  smaller islands because I'm into diving and fishing.
dpKntiZoaa	Again it is stereotyping (which I have to say I find basically not a productive trait) and not allowing for the person which is usually far more different than the average stereotype.  You will have men that treat women like princesses and never even dream of cheating of them - right down to the scale of a cheater & liar. <br>  <br>  Indeed the stereotypes I have read are very different to my experience. It is also most certainly not the case that Bosnians are either "aggressive" by nature or expecting women to be a "humble, Bosnian" wife. That is just ignorance from small mindedness.<br>  <br>  Most Bosnians I have met (including my husband and male family members) do have a "fire" burning within their spirit and are passionate in opinions. Sometimes in verbal discussions it can seem like everyone is talking and no-one is listening, but it is not personal. To be honest this is somewhat similar to the animated spirit of Latino's (albeit via a very limited experience that I have with Latino's)<br>  <br>  Bosnian men usually tell things exactly how they are, without beating around the bush.  This can be interpretted as direct and blunt.  If (I assume you are asking as a Latina female) this is something you appreciate then it works well.  If you prefer the less direct and kinder way of working around the point and hoping the other person gets it; well then you may find this a problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  As I said, personally I find the match between two individuals to be unique and based more on personality and chemistry, than on nationality - but this is of course subjective as well.|`|daYzD9NOaa	My brother is Bosnian and has a girlfriend that is Mexican.

nfu6LiVXaa	I am not familiar with the citizenship rules of the US, but I do know a lot of people in similar situation (Canadian and HK residency). Most of these people enter HK with their HK Permanent Resident ID card because if they should require hospitalization or medical treatment, you may be required to pay a deposit before you get anything. They don't have problems crossing immigration into HK, but I do know many of them still need to get a visa to enter China (I believe only people born in HK and have the 3 stars on their ID card can enter China without a visa).<br>  <br>  HK/China don't require you to get a Chinese passport and you can still travel to other countries with your US green card/passport. Just like the people I know, they travel elsewhere with the Canadian passport for better protection (ie. if there should be a riot or whatever in the country you're visiting, you're protected by the Canadian embassy). <br>  <br>  Also, HK/China don't require you to turn in your residency ID card after you got US citizenship. As long as you renew your HK ID card when asked to, that card is yours.|`|fVWYr0ISaa	The thing is the Chinese government wouldn't allow a Chinese Citizen to have dual citizenship, but that is not the case with the U.S. government, which dual citizenship is permissible. However, the Chinese government wouldn't know if you have been naturalized to U.S. unless you pronounce it to them. Naturally if a Chinese citizen becomes a citizen of anywhere else in the world, he/she automatically gives up his Chinese citizenship. I know for a fact that holds true for China, but HK has a totally different system from that of China since it is a special administrated region. <br>  <br>  On a note of the green card, it depends on where you would want to spend most of your life in, U.S., HK, or China? If you are going to work in states, then you mind as well naturalize to become an American Citizen, since there are benefits in finding jobs and such. But if you are going to spend most of your time in HK/China, then you should hold your green card.|`|sJfARvvXaa	I,m a chinese man,if let me to chose i will stick with the green card.this didn't mean i don't love my country.i think to decide which country i live is based on my career.it's dream for chinese people to live in american.in there,there are more opportunity to make big change to the world.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	No, "they" do not make you give up the Chinese citizenship...and anyway...how is the Chinese govt even going to know the person now has U.S. citizenship unless he goes over there and announces it to them?  The U.S. does not require anyone to renounce their previous citizenship.  On the 2nd site below, read the 3rd paragraph under "Citizenship by Naturalization."  the 2nd site is the same one I gave you before.  you now have 2 sites stating that a person is NOT required to give up their original citizenship to become a U.S. citizen.  Of course, the personn can also consult an immigration lawyer and when he applies for citizenship, he can ask this question too.
eUbldFuOaa	Dude, when i was 16(without parents) I got to stay in Germany for 2 months, it was some of the most fun I've ever had.<br>  O.K. Here's the story: My parents hosted a German foreign exchange student for a year and he became part of the family (he happened to be pretty wealthy), so he decided to take me back with him. He is a few years older than me(so I was hanging out with 19 year olds), and here's what I have to say about Europe.<br>  I stayed in a town named Werden (near Essen), the people were all extremely friendly, I loved the Turkish sandwich carts (mmmmm veil), and the fact that I could order beer at the bar.<br>  I traveled all over Europe, I got to drive on the Autobahn (do this), I went to Paris and went to the Louve (pretty interesting), I also camped on the French coast (nude beach, and yes they shave) for a 16 year old I was in heaven. I had sex with a french girl, hot accent.<br>  I had Belgian waffles in Belgium (Belgium is kinda like Mexico for us californians.)<br>  I smoked weed (legally) in Amsterdam. The Red Light District was intense. Lots of Brothels (I didn't get a hooker)and weed cafes. Took a water ferry through all the canals.<br>  Any way, all of Europe is beautiful (especially Germany, so green) have lots of fun.<br>  Oh I skated a skate park in Munster, Germany, saw castles, and the golden shrine and alot of other stuff, but I cant write it all down.<br>  They have real stinky cheese, and dont keep their fridges as cold as ours, so the milk taste funny. But they love to drink, I loved Europe.<br>  Hopefully you get along with your host family and you and both families get to travel back and forth for many years, like I am able to do.|`|RFK9sG6zaa	This is no joke... "IF" you could find someway to handle walking around "ALL DAY" in short's in the winter you would win more respect than you would believe.   A true German youth will go all winter long wearing a pair of leather shorts (like it's summer time).  Also, German's can drink beer and 'what-ever' all day long and never get drunk.  I'm not saying that's cool it's just a fact.  Naturally, the drinking is up to you, but, the Germans are a very-very tough bunch.  In fact, if they like you they will almost knock you off your chair with a slap on the back after telling a good joke.  <br>  <br>  And... I know for a fact you will fall in love with some blue eye'd blond hair Honey.  Just remember the rule: "KISS HER... YOU MARRY HER !!!"
z6TI1ZDDaa	Spent some time in the rain forest of southern Kalimantan 2nd largest in the world.  <br>  (Borneo, Indonesia) <br>    <br>     Wear:  lightweight shirt and shorts, sturdy shoes, a waterproof hat<br>     <br>     Shelter:  it rains a lot, would need something water tight and up off<br>     the ground.  The natives build over the water as it is somewhat<br>     cooler and it keeps wild animals out of the house.<br>  <br>     There was a great variety of fruit that grew wild.  Also, if the rain forest is in Asia there would have to be rice.  Wild boar was one of the<br>     favorite meals (it was GOOD!)  They raise chickens and have cows.<br>  <br>     People had television, not many channels.  Only a few had a pc.     <br>     Families spent a lot of time together.  Teens played dice games and<br>     dreamed of owning motorcycles.  The old women talked together <br>     and the old men sat squatted down watching the road.<br>  <br>   They are wonderful, hospitable people.

Britain gave the Arabs their other modern countries as well. Britain also explained that prior to the UN vote "it is not international land therefore not internationalists place to divvy up the land." Britain ruled the land, and they gave it up to Jewish people who were already there, and to make homeland for Jewish people around the world. 14May1948.<br>  <br>  The statehood on all the countries that waged war on fledgling Israel is as follows: Jordan 25 May 1946, Israel 14, May 1948, Syria 17 April 1946, Lebanon 22 November 1943, Egypt 18 February 1922, Iraq 3 October 1932, North Yemen 1918, South Yemen 1968<br>  <br>  Israel won that war, she actually won her land back from the lame UN vote. The land wasn't taken from anyone else either, so you see, the other Arabs also got their modern nations. Jordan rec'd 80% of the British Territory that was named Palestine. It is just that Arabs did not want Israel to exist at all and declared war on Israel. Everyone gave up except Syria, and Syria invented these "Palestine" myth of a people to continue the war. Arabs already admitted this:<br>  <br>  -------------------------------------<br>  Arab Quotes:<br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."<br>  <br>  "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it."- Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937 -<br>  "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."<br>  - Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946 -<br>  "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria."- Rep. of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956 <br>  -Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated:<br>  "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."<br>  <br>  "You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967...The Israelis can sue you now, and if they sue you they will win."<br>  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...</a><br>  <br>  "Palestine and Jordan are one..." said King Abdullah in 1948.<br>  <br>  "The truth is that Jordan is Palestine and Palestine is Jordan," said King Hussein of Jordan, in 1981.<br>  <br>  "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate," Prince Hassan of the Jordanian National Assembly was quoted as saying on February 2, 1970.<br>  <br>  Accordingly, Abdul Hamid Sharif, Prime Minister of Jordan declared, in 1980, "The Palestinians and Jordanians do not belong to different nationalities. They hold the same Jordanian passports, are Arabs and have the same Jordanian culture."<br>  ------------------------------------<br>  <br>  So you see, these Arabs have an identity crisis. First they are all Syrian, then they are Jordanian, then they are new Palestinian people wanting to take Israel. The simple fact of the matter is that Syria invented the PLO to overtake Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon. These people are Syrians.<br>  <br>  <br>  So celebrate all you want...I just don't know what exactly you're so happy about..?|`|ZjgUTUqXaa	I would be great if there was a two state solution and there could be peace between the Palestinians and Israelis.  <br>  <br>  I do remember "her" saying that...what no answer from Photo Finnish...oops I mean Beautiful Sunset yet?

IT IS CALLED JORDAN.<br>  <br>  Let's closely examine the facts of history from the Arab perspective, rather than the Jewish one, regarding Jordan and Palestine. <br>  <br>  "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate," Prince Hassan of the Jordanian National Assembly was quoted as saying on February 2, 1970. <br>  <br>  Accordingly, Abdul Hamid Sharif, Prime Minister of Jordan declared, in 1980, "The Palestinians and Jordanians do not belong to different nationalities. They hold the same Jordanian passports, are Arabs and have the same Jordanian culture." <br>  <br>  In other words, Jordan is Palestine. Arab Palestine. There is absolutely no difference between Jordan and Palestine, nor between Jordanians and Palestinians (all actually Arabs). <br>  <br>  This fact is also confirmed by other Arabs, Jordanians and 'Palestinans' who were either rulers or scholars. <br>  <br>  "There should be a kind of linkage because Jordanians and Palestinians are considered by the PLO as one people," according to Farouk Kaddoumi, then head of the PLO Political Department, who gave the statement to Newsweek on March 14, 1977. Distinguished Arab-American Princeton University historian Philip Hitti testified before the Anglo-American Committee, <br>  <br>  "There is no such thing as 'Palestine' in history." <br>  According to Arab-American columnist Joseph Farah, <br>  "Palestine has never existed - before or since - as an autonomous entity. It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire, and briefly by the British after World War I. The British agreed to restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland. There was no language known as Palestinian. There was no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a Palestine governed by the Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc." <br>  These authoritative, honest statements are by Arabs, Jordanians and Palestinians, and absolutely must be taken at their face value and word. <br>  All right, so you're not quite into quotes. How about these tasteful tidbits of historical facts? <br>  <br>  * Jews, not Arabs, have lived continuously in the ancient Biblical Promised Land of Israel, especially Judea and Samaria, for 3,700 years. This land was given as a gift by G-d to the Children of Israel (Hebrews, Israelites, Jews) and is so stated in all of the three monotheistic religions' holy books - Old Testament, New Testament and Quran. Faithful followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all believe in the same one G-d and therefore must believe the word of their G-d. G-d does not make and break his promises. There is a very valuable lesson to be learned by all his children and faithful followers. <br>  * The current queen of Jordan is an Arab 'Palestinian'.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	how can 2009 be the year when hamas and fatah are still in a civil war? you are not living in the real world. until there is a pali unity government, there won't be a country.|`|Fb519XJgaa	I will invite my best friends over for the only food cooked in Palestine  the Magluba. and maybe some Somagiea.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Cry in my beer?|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	2009 will not be the year, unless I am very much mistaken.

pI5jKfmaaa	Your queries are answered in the following link :<br>  <br>  <br>  State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttaranchal - SIDCUL<br>  SIDCUL FAQ's<br>  <br>  What is SIDCUL?<br>  <br>  SIDCUL, a Government of Uttaranchal Enterprise, was incorporated as a Limited Company in the year 2002 with an authorised share capital of Rs. 50 Crores and Rs. 20 Crores paid up capital through Government of Uttaranchal in order to promote Industrial development in the State, provide financial assistance in the shape of debt, equity, venture capital, develop infrastructure and assist private initiative in Industry and Infrastructure and implement, manage projects and provide specialized financial, consultancy and construction and all such other activities to promote industries and develop Industrial Infrastructure in the State of Uttaranchal directly or through Special Purpose Vehicles, Joint Ventures, assisted companies etc. <br>  <br>  Besides the State Government, SIDCUL has equity participation from LIC, ICICI and SIDBI. Other banks are also in the process of participating in its equity. This has led to a high degree of professionalism and autonomy in the functioning of the Corporation. The spate of concessions available for Industrial ventures in Uttaranchal along with the proactive govt. and facilitative environment has lead to more than a thousand EOI’s with SIDCUL, which entail an investment of around Rs. 5000 Crores plus and a land requirement of around 3500 Acres.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. When was SIDCUL established?<br>  <br>  18 July 2002<br>  <br>  <br>  3. What is the total strength/personnel of SIDCUL today?<br>  <br>  21 officers (regular) and same number of contracted/ outsourced staff.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  Sharda Motors already in action.<br>  IIE Haridwar. More ? <br>   <br>  4. What is the total area offered in Haridwar, Pantnagar and Sitarganj?<br>  <br>  Haridwar 2000 acres<br>  Pantnagar : 3339 acres<br>  Sitarganj : 1174 acres<br>  <br>  Total industrial area developed since independence till 2001: 2500 acres<br>  Developed by SIDCUL: 8000 acres.<br>  <br>  Industrial growth rate 1993-94 to 2000-01 : 1.8%<br>  Last three years : 19%<br>  <br>  <br>  5. what are the plans for other areas like Kotdwara, Bhimtal and others?<br>  <br>  Kotdwar is under progress , 25 % marketed, slated for inaugutration by q3, 2006<br>  <br>  <br>  6. What is the progress with Tata project and when do you think it will come up for development?<br>  <br>  Tata has started construction, operations by March 07<br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  HLL in operation, IIE Haridwar. More ? <br>   <br>  7. The allottees Industrial plots in Haridwar have complaints against SIDCUL issuing warning and forefeiting deposits if they do not raise the structure and start activities they have been sanctioned the land for. What is SIDCUL's policy and what grace period or legal action are you contemplating against such investors?<br>  <br>  I am ready to live with criticism rather than tolerating speculators. We have cancelled around 70 plots so far. We also have a policy for surrender; for details see website www.sidcul.com. My assessment is that we shall see 80-90% fructification of proposals by 2007 as opposed to 30-40% in comparable industrial estates.<br>  <br>  8. What are the major issues the invstors are facing in building up the Industrial Estates in UA? What are the challenges for SIDCUL once the industrial process gets over and measure taken by you to handle environment and industrial relations?<br>  <br>  We have very good industrial relations here- shortage of requisite skill sets is something we are hoping to address through a knowledge city in Kashipur.<br>  <br>  <br>  9 . What are your plans for mountain industries? Does SIDCUL cover the village and small industries or is there any other agency in the state for the industrial developments in the hills?<br>  <br>  Processing of horticulture produce; cool chain infrastructure; tourism is another.<br>  <br>  <br>  10. What is the total investment that the State has already been committed?<br>  19964 crores; 2032 units<br>  <br>  <br>  11. What employment has been created by the Hardwar, Pantnagar and Sitarganj Esates for the State? Does it mean the local lads are competitive and capable of getting jobs in the Global investors in the State?<br>  <br>  Total Direct : 1,00,000. Indirect 3 times.<br>  <br>  For more information on SIDCUL, please visit SIDCUL Official Website- www.sidcul.com

oUqLwOYFaa	There are so many different places to visit that it's hard to say which one is the best one. However, there are some top choices that you can definitely start with.<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, San Francisco is the best city to visit within the United States. It's beautiful, it's got a lot of interesting sights to see, it's easy to get around and the people are friendly. However, the weather may not be right for you since it's not a super hot place. If you do go, the best times to go are probably late April and anytime in October because that's when it tends to be warmest.<br>  <br>  I've been reading a lot about Buenos Aires lately and from what I understand it has a lot of similarities to San Francisco but it's a much warmer destination. If you're interested in international travel then I think that would be a great city to look into.<br>  <br>  If you want to stick with the United States and you think that San Francisco is too cold then another beautiful California destination that's warmer is San Diego. Beautiful beaches, beautiful urban parks and beautiful people can be found here.<br>  <br>  Of course, the West Coast isn't the only place in the United States to find beautiful warm locations. Any city in Florida, particularly down near the Keys, would be good. Houston can be nice specifically because of the nearby warm ocean. If you don't care about beaches then there are tons of cities in Arizona that are great with Tucson probably being the best of the bunch.<br>  <br>  I'd say to figure out specifically what you want to experience in your travel destination (beaches vs. desert, urban vs. small town, U.S. vs. worldwide) and then go from there with picking a destination.

emEnY5UVaa	Hi, I'm Bahraini and I believe that a monthly salary of 1700 BD for a family with 2 kids is not a problem in Bahrain. Your salary is considered a high pay in Bahrain especially for a small family. whether you're work is in Muharraq (a very calm town) or any other place, Bahrain is a very small country which you can travel around it in an hour (in rush hours). Rents are kinda high, but I don't believe its high comparing them to UAE. If you had a problem with rents you can move to Manama, a cheaper place, but also a lower living style. If your planning to stay there until your children are ready to go to school I'd advice you to take them to Shwaifat international school which is located in Amwaj, Muharraq. If your not satisfied you can try one of the international schools like american, british, french, indian or pakistani schools. Most of them are located in Isa Town which is more than 30 minutes drive in rush hour.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.|`|CJRon7Fcaa	3 BR flat depends on the location costs anywhere upwards of BD 500-700. The other expenses apart from travel and acco are in the range of BD 200-250 and would be in line with the expenses in Abu Dhabi as the costs are not very different here.

oE06n8OAaa	the theory is that nature designs itself (i.e. the animals plants and all living things in general) so that the strongest survive.A plant that cannot withstand cold won't survive in colder weather, an animal born with a genetic defect (such as partly paralyzed) will be killed or eaten by other animal quicker than a strong healthy one.that way the gene pool remains as pure as possible.Darwin suggests that there is a natural progress of species evolving to be better in every way they need to be ( a strain of virus will evolve to withstand an antibiotic) that way the species remains alive and continuous to live on through the centuries.Thats the general idea anyway!|`|0KR4wyoQaa	He was in Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.

47eca288b7cf9a8664fc08a02872370eaa	I'd jump on any round trip fare below $500.  Mostly I see them in the range of $600 to 800.  Above $850 or so and I feel like I'm getting a bad deal.<br>  <br>  Check expedia.com or travelocity.com to compare all the carriers.  I then go to the carrier's site directly to purchase, because if I need to change something, I don't want to go through travelocity - I want to be able to change with the airline directly.  Alaska Airlines has by far the most fights each day.  But occassionally Delta or Northwest or Frontier (they aren't on travelocity) will have a lower fare.<br>  <br>  Other possibilities include using someone's frequent flyer miles to do award travel.<br>  <br>  Or consider having her take the State Ferry to Bellingham Washington (if she lives in SE Alaska) and then taking a bus or flight to California.<br>  <br>  If you can plan ahead for next year, each October Alaska Airlines offers "PFD specials" for travel originating in Alaska.  It can be $150-300 less than usual so I try to have several of our family trips scheduled and ready to book each October.<br>  <br>  If she's in college or could stop by a campus of UAA, UAF, or UAJ she could look at a ride board of students looking to head south for the summer and share gas costs with them.

gXJdryRNaa	Where are you staying?  Do you have a cabin of your own or are you bunking with your boyfriend or his family?<br>  <br>  The cruise line may make an issue of it by asking "will she be supervised all the time?" or something similar.  <br>  <br>  You should just be honest about this.  The cruise line will compare your birth certificate or passport to your ship documentation to make sure that they are accurate.  When they notice (on embarkation) that your last name is different, they may make a comment about it, depending on the cruise line.  <br>  <br>  You and your boyfriend are putting his mother and his family in a serious predicament.  What if you should become ill while on the cruise and a doctor must be summoned for you?  If you rely on the family to give the doc bad information that could affect the treatment you receive.<br>  <br>  You may not end up going on the cruise but I would be honest with your boyfriends' mother and family.  You already say that his family wouldn't approve.   That says that you and your boyfriend are hoping this will all just go away.|`|EoEjbKpzaa	As long as your not staying in the same room as her,  or she has access to your information you shouldn't have a problem. I've been on cruises when i was younger than 18 and when i was older, and they never brought up my age or treated me any differently. I don't think there is anyway she would find that out.<br>  <br>  If you are mature and act like your older why does it matter how old you are? Hopefully you can have a honest relationship with her and she wouldn't care about your age|`|OLeYNeCFaa	You will be issued with a ship ID card which will have a mark on it: a sticker, a hole, a different colour, you also won't be allowed to drink alcohol, and the amount you can spend on your account will be limited some company will ask the parent to sign for the account, your future mother in law is bound to know sooner or later|`|vfqaiqvfaa	Not sure if you've realized this or not...but to go on the cruise your parents must prepare a "permission slip" that is notarized since you are not going with your parents.  In doing this, it will probably turn on the light bulbs in your boyfriends parents heads about how old you are...because...if you were over 18, you wouldn't need to have this done.  You can read about that here: <a href="http://www.cruisediva.com/parental_permission1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cruisediva.com/parental_permi...</a><br>  <br>  You could also call the cruise line to double check..<br>  <br>  Edited to add, double check the age on the letter your parents need to write.  It may be for 21 and under, but call the cruise line for more info on that.|`|ukpp19ESaa	the only problem that might occur is your cruise card . all passengers are issued a card which acts as a cabin door key and credit card for items purchased on board ie. bar drinks ,coffee shops boutique s etc as no moey is used on the ships . you register a credit card and pay the billat the end of your cruise. if your age is required it may stop you purchasing drinks ,not allow you in the casino or night club.|`|AA11163314	The biggest issue is that you may not be allowed on the ship.  Very few cruise lines are willing to accept the potential liability of having a minor on board without a paernt ot legal guardain present.<br>  <br>  Which cruise line are you taking and have you checked their policies on this?|`|0UVqBCNdaa	It will blow up in your face, and it's in your best interest to either cancel or get it fixed.<br>  <br>  First, you will be denied boarding.  The cruise line will not allow you to board the ship as a minor, who is traveling without a parent or legal guardian.    Unless you get your parents to fill out and sign a consent form in the presence of a notary public.  I don't know if your boyfriends parents also have to sign at the same time or not.  But, if they do, they're going to find out you're 17.  What's the difference though, they are going to find out you are 17 before long anyways.<br>  <br>  In Addition To The Child's Citizenship Documentation, A Minor Child Under The Age Of 18 Must Have A Legal <br>  Guardian, Or Parental Consent Form From Their Birth Parents To Exit The United States And Enter Most Foreign <br>  Countries. Parents Should Complete One Of The Forms Listed Below For Each Minor Child Under The Age Of 18 <br>  (At The Time Travel Starts) To Prevent Immigration Problems When Entering Or Leaving The Country. <br>   <br>  When The Form Is Completed, ONLY SIGN It In The Presence Of A Notary Public! <br>   <br>  FORM #1  - Both Birth Parents Are Alive  -  If both birth parents  are  alive,  and one or both of  them will NOT be <br>  traveling with minor  children,  the non-traveling parent(s) must  complete  the  form giving  a notarized  affidavit of <br>  consent to the person traveling with the child(ren) their authorization to take them in and out of the country or to <br>  allow the minor child to travel on their own with no guardian. <br>  <br>  What ever you told the cruise line your age was, has to match what is on your passport or birth certificate.  If it doesn't, however, you will be able to get some really nice photos of the ship sailing off in to the distance, while you are standing on the pier, because you won't be on the ship.<br>  <br>  I'd call the cruise line or your travel agent first thing in the morning and see what they require in your situation.<br>  <br>  And as others have pointed out your Sign and Sail/SeaPass card is going to be marked.  Whether it is a different color, has holes in it, has a sticker on it, there will be something to mark that you are under 18.  Oh, and all the invitations you will get to sign up for the kids programs when you are on the ship, since you will be <br>  <br>  Just because you've already bought the ticket and it's already arranged, doesn't mean you're in the clear.  You are far from it.

v90vFco1aa	The Exploratorium is so fun. I went a few times with my k-8 school and it was fun every time, at all different ages. I'm now a sophomore in college and I went with a group of friends at the end of last semester and we all loved it. It's so great because it's interactive! So anyone can enjoy it. Also, you should pack a lunch. Sandwiches, drinks, chips ect.. there is a seating area inside the museum to eat and they have a little food court.. but the food is pricey and not too good. If you go to the Exploratorium, definately look into doing the Tactile Dome! It's crazy! <br>  www.exploratorium.edu<br>  I can't even really describe what the Tactile Dome is, but look into it thorugh the website and see if it's something that sounds fun, because it is! You have to buy Tactile Dome tickets way in advance, though. If you try to get in on the day you go, it will absolutely be sold out. It's always sold out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another great museum is the new California Academy of Sciences in it's new location within Golden Gate Park. <br>  www.calacademy.org<br>  This is the museum someone mentioned with the "living roof." It also has an amazing aquarium and other countless exhibits. It's not has "hands on" as the exploratorium is, but I feel like it's much bigger. It's also incredibly new and has so much to offer! There is a huge digital planetarium and a four story rainforest. It's really an inredible new museum. You should try to do both, but if you absolutely can't then I would probably choose the Cal Academy of Sciences. It's great.<br>  <br>  These two are hands down, the best for all ages.

In my case it was a county office; if we had to get the one where my sons were born, it was city hall. <br>  <br>  The only problem  you are going to run into is that if you don't live in or near the city where you were born you might be out of luck as they can't fax an official copy of a birth cerficiate.|`|XQ3jHM9aaa	It used to be that you just had to show your birth certificate to travel internationally, but I think now a passport is required.

Hike El Faro, the views are fantastic, sail on the Patricia Belle - she is an 82 foot wooden schooner, golf out at Estrella del Mar - several holes run along the ocean, check out the cathedral and mercado, eat upstairs at the mercado for lunch, do the Los Osuna Tequila factory tour and zip line, go dancing at Joe's Oyster bar and/or Mambo Cafe ........

JoC6dlASaa	Hey, I am from PA and moved to Queensland and my advice to you is not to come. Maybe Sydney or Melbourne...if you do possess the right skills and can get a visa, you would be able to drive with your PA license for one year, then you would have to get an Queensland drivers license but you do not need to take any kind of test...you just fill out an application form. The driving laws are similar but hopefully you realize that they drive on the left side of the road. It is very easy to transition though. Hope that helps.|`|jwPWiV3Oaa	I just moved my family of 4, sight unseen to Qld and regret not visiting first to see what I was getting myself into.  It is VERY different here from when we are used to.  My kids are fine but my hubby and I are having a hard time.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention if you have been before or not - I recommend it highly before making any other big decisions.|`|NU565Vlwaa	www.rta.gov.au|`|y64uHdyJaa	Eww, don't go to Queensland...|`|VLQYQaXfaa	Where in Queensland were you planning to move to? Metro or rural? Firstly, you need to plot where exactly you would live permanently, e.g coastal or inland.<br>  I would suggest renting at first to see whether you would enjoy living here rather than tying yourself down to a mortgage, even if this is a good time to buy a property.<br>  You can use a local real estate agent.<br>  Normally, you would shell out a deposit to secure the property or purchase outright. Heaps of paperwork involved.<br>  Check out www.domain.com.au to view a suitable property.<br>  <br>  You don't need to sit any wirtten or driver's test only pay the prescribed fee for a Queensland license and this can be viewed on:<br>  www.transport.qld.gov.au<br>  Road rules are also incuded on this site<br>  <br>  In Australia, drivers sit on the right hand side of the car and drive on the left hand side  (oppsite to you).|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	no you don't just find an agent and buy a house<br>  <br>  to immigrate to australia you must be skilled and experienced in an occupation australia is in need of that is listed on the skilled occupation list<br>  you must also pass the points test<br>  <br>  im not sure but i think they are only processing applications from the critical skill list at the moment|`|zHmZkMStaa	Hate to dissappoint you, but Australia has very strict immigration policies.  You probably won't get accepted long term unless you possess a rare and needed skill in an occupation they have desperate need for.  Only other way is to perhaps marry an Australian?

ECB8u72Taa	Your question assumes that New Yorkers actually are rude.  It's like the question, "have you stopped beating your wife?"<br>  <br>  Assuming your question is really, "Why did New Yorkers seem so rude to me?"  Well, New York has over 8 million people, so you're likely to meet every kind of person that exists.  Whether you want to associate with bankers, insurance salesmen, social workers, singers or zen masters, you can find them all in NYC.  Some of the people might seem rude and annoying, and others might seem gracious and polite.  <br>  <br>  On a final note, let's say you're from the UK.  What if someone asked, "Why are all people in the UK so rude?"...wouldn't you think that would be a fairly rude question?|`|YAiKlPkMaa	It isn't New York, it's the whole Yankee thing. I lived in the south for years but am from Pennsylvania. I would go home to visit and couldn't believe how nasty the people were. It seems the North Eastern portion of the US is cold.|`|HFlytHlRaa	Why are some people so quick to stereotype? Frankly, your question seems fairly rude. If you behaved in the same manner that you're exuding here, then perhaps the behavior you received was deserved. <br>  <br>  There are rude people in every city as there are courteous people in every city. To suggest that the x-million of people living in New York (I assume you mean the city) are all rude is preposterous.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would suggest that the demeanor of *some* New Yorkers is a result of being in a hurry a great deal of the time. New York City is a fast-paced place, not everyone is going to take time and play Mary Sunshine to every tourist they meet.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	Christopher, why do you think they are rude?  Did you have a bad experience in NYC?   I don't think they are rude. When I've been there I found them to be helpful and polite. Remember they live and work there, so  they don't have time to stop while you take a picture, or stand in the middle of the sidewalk to look at a map. Sometimes tourists can be obnoxious & boisterous so it must get very tiresome for  NYC residents.|`|xiB1BPwsaa	Compared to who?<br>  <br>  They may seem rude compared to Tibetans.<br>  <br>  However, compared to Brits they are outright gracious.|`|6qGHT77Raa	we are NOT rude.<br>  nyc is the most welcoming city.<br>  but it is a competitive place to live and work..and sometimes..many times we are stressed.|`|AA11705909	I don't know why but they just are. I assume it is something to do with the social competition and status seeking that is endemic there.|`|1be40c12a77f6c00d5dfd80e2c986569aa	Why do tourists always think that the entire world should behave the same way that their little backwards town does?<br>  <br>  NYC is one of the friendliest cities in the world when you know how things work.  I find it funny that people in Times Square think that the entire world should stop when they want to take a picture.  If you ever look around, there is ALWAYS someone taking a picture.  If we stopped all of the time, then no one would be able to move through.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	it does not matter what state you go to you will find rude people and you will find really nice people . you should not base your facts on a few people you ran into in New York...|`|jxg88KqFaa	Maybe because people always stereotype them?|`|df6f139089176891ad0fbe3562d6dcc8aa	They wont ever change so your answer is be the same back and they wont realise it|`|HF1TfsnTaa	Because we can be .Now go away.

TlXLKVEOaa	call Ryan air and ask them..Good god by the time you wrote this question you could of had your answer!|`|459f3e221cf02dc2127bf3273665bfb4aa	I presume by expiry date you mean flight date (seeing as there won't be an expiry date on there).  If that is what you mean then no you will have to buy a new flight as once you have checked in online you can't change your booking (it makes this very clear when you check in online).  <br>  <br>  If however there seems to be a mistake on your boarding card in relation to what you booked then you need to contact Ryanair by telephone so they can correct the mistake for you.  They will only do this if you can prove that you booked the correct date and there has been some sort of technical error, not if you made a human error!<br>  <br>  Also if you have booked the wrong date by mistake I would advise re-booking asap as the later you leave it the more expensive it will be especially if you wait until the day you want to fly.
AA10042296	Click the first link below to read review of 245 restaurants in PV, ranked in order of popularity.<br>  If you want to hang on a wire and fly through the jungle go with Canopy Tours de Los Veranos.<br>  If you want to learn surfing, go 40 minutes north of the PV airport to Sayulita.<br>  If you want to go Sport Fishing, go up to Punta Mita (again north of the PV airport) to Real Hot Charters.<br>  Watch the movies below.|`|JgGKjM5Gaa	I would recommend "La Palapa", this restaurant is in the Romantic zone, ask anyone, or grab a turist mapa, you'll find it, talk about upscale, 3 course meals, right on the beach, the sound of the ocean, with your loved one, a nice glass of wine.<br>  <br>  Some mariachi or Trio band serenating you.<br>  <br>  You have to experience that romantic setting.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you like to try authentic mexican food, try a "burrita" no misspelling here, PV's own creation. Shrimp burritas are the best, the best place it's in front of Hotel rosita, in front of the town square. ask around there people will tell you.<br>  <br>  Go to the malecon Friday night, and experience food "antojitos" like the locals, mangos with chili powder, deserts, baked goods, corn in the cob, or in a cup with fixings. plus you'll get to buy some souvenirs.<br>  <br>  Enjoy.<br>  <br>  You have to go to Yelapa. and Caletas.|`|cMFvCVGoaa	I went last March and had a blast. The hotel that we stayed at had an event coordinator, and you could book travel/sightseeing events through him. As far as restaurants - the most popular night spot is Senor Frogs (a lot of fun in the later hours - I don't know how young you guys are, but if you like to go out, this is one of the places you should try - also try The Zoo). Also, about an hour outside of the city there is a place that does zip-lining through the mountains. Its breathtaking, and I had a blast. In downtown Puerto Vallarta, across from the beach, there is a flea market. Lots of great buys, and even if you aren't interested in purchasing any souveniers its fun to walk around that area. Taxis are really cheap, so don't hesitate to hitch a ride rather than wander around looking for all these places! <br>  <br>  Congrats! And I hope you guys have a great time!!|`|etIBdVE3aa	Be sure and eat diner at El Campanario. It is owned & runned by Tony (PV Native)<br>  <br>  Hes place is located directly across the street from the big Guadalupe church down town. He serves traditional food from this region. Pozole, Tostadas, Tacos, Tamales and Atole.<br>  <br>  I like to recommend this place to all. Its a must do.|`|GStTSYf4aa	Pepe's - a fun mexican style restaurant.  it is decorated very "fiesta-like". the staff are all very friendly and fun.  You can hear the chefs in the back singing mexican songs.  The food and drink portions are huge!<br>  <br>  Brazil - Only if you like meat!  They bring out big swords with meat on them and slice pieces off onto your plate.  Many many different kinds of meats.  It is fairly expensive if I remember correctly, but it is delicious and fun! You can eat as much as you want to|`|MtKmKDVlaa	La Dolce Vita and Pepe's...both in the downtown area.|`|C1VuXSPfaa	My favorite clubs that we checked out were<br>  The Roxy...a local bar, that has live bands they were amazing:)<br>  <br>  Andalay's....always busy, great music, really "touisty" but super fun.<br>  <br>  Pepe's had amazing food..they are in "old town"<br>  its pricey but soo worth it...make sure you go there starving though!<br>  <br>  The Boardwalk always has stuff going on! they usually have a live comedian every night across the street from the church.
hhWDHmfyaa	Most banks offer a kidcard now.  You would give him $100 cash in case of emergency, then a 'Student Card' as that is what most of them are called.<br>  <br>  You can put a maximum of like $30 a day on the card, then check the account on-line daily to make sure he has enough money.<br>  <br>  It would be best to tell your son to eat at the hotel as much as possible.  The food costs in the park are huge.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	As someone else mentioned, if he is eating at the parks and park hotels, about the best he could do is $10 per meal.  He will almost definitely eat at least once or twice for more than that.  Letting him have $50 a day for food and snacks is not at all unreasonable.  For souvenirs, you just need to make a guess.  Give him $10, he'll spend it.  Give him $1,000, he'll spend it.  So whatever you can afford - a couple hundred bucks would be nice.  EVERYWHERE at Disney takes credit cards, so I would recommend a minimum of cash.|`|AA10838250	credit card, if cash several thousand dollars|`|0WASp0bHaa	Depends if he has to pay for every meal. Go to site below for all disney menus and prices. As you can see even a counter service meal is going to be $10. He can easily spend $40 per day on breakfast, lunch, dinner and a drink or two. <br>  <br>  I would get a credit card that can be replace if lost. One that has a certain amount of money on it and can be refunded if lost or stolen. maybe a American Express travelers CC. Check with your bank.<br>  <br>  edit. I assumed you son will be staying at a disney resort. food there will be expensive too. site below will have resort menus.|`|72hMibsVaa	pre paid credit card would be best with about 50 in cash for some of the kiosk snack carts that only take cash.  Arcade in hotel area, etc.<br>  <br>  I would say about 300$ to start.  If he runs out, you can get add to his card especially if you get the student card from walmart. where there is one for parents and one for the kid.|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	maybe give him a credit card, and some cash<br>  credit card for whatever he would like to buy, and maybe like 100$ in cash to buy drinks, and snacks <br>  It gets very hot in Disney so he will be thirsty, and get hungry easily<br>  Hope he has fun
